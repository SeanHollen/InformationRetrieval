   Iran blamed Iraq Friday for the stalemate
in their year-old peace talks and said if Iraq does not withdraw
from captured territory ``within a reasonable time'' Tehran must
consider other, forceful action.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told the U.N.
General Assembly that after more than one year and 15 rounds of
U.N.-sponsored talks, virtually no progress has been made since
establishment of a cease-fire.
   He called on the international community and the Security
Council to put pressure on Iraq to withdraw immediately to
international borders and release all prisoners of war, as demanded
in a Security Council resolution. Iran, he said, is ready to comply
fully with all obligations.
   Iraq, in turn, has repeatedly accused Iran of bogging down peace
talks. At a summit conference of the non-aligned movement in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on Sept. 5, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
charged in remarks made to reporters that Iran rejects peace talks
with Iraq.
   The Security Council on Friday renewed the mandate of the U.N.
peacekeeping group in Iran and Iraq for six more months and called
upon both countries to implement the council's peace plan.
   ``Iraq has refused to take the very first step in fulfillment of
its obligations ... namely, withdrawal from the territory of
Iran,'' Velayati said. ``Iraq has tried to take advantage of
illegal occupation of the territory of Iran for realization of
illegitimate and expansionist ambitions for which it launched a war
of aggression.''
   He said that Iraq ``must realize that peace is to the benefit of
the two countries and the region. Continuation of the present
no-peace-no-war situation can gradually move the region toward
resumption of tension,'' Velayati said.
   He said Iran welcomes the forthcoming visit of special U.N.
envoy Jan Elliason, U.N. ambassador of Sweden, to both capitals and
will continue to cooperate with the U.N. secretary-general.
   ``But if these efforts do not lead within a reasonable time to a
change in iraq's stance, other measures must be contemplated,''
Velayati said.
   Earlier Friday he told a news conference that Iran would use
force to recapture its territory if Iraq does not withdraw. He was
repeating a statement by Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
several weeks ago.
   In his speech Friday Velayati also condemned Iraq's use of
chemical weapons in their war and said any international ban on
such weapons, as proposed by the United States and others, must
include strong punitive measures.
   Earlier Friday, Velayati said his government was ready to help
seek the release of U.S. and other hostages in Lebanon, if the
United States releases billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen
since the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian
radicals in 1979.
   ``If we can do anything to help any country (win release of its
hostages), we do not hesitate,'' Velayati said in answer to a
question. ``But I hope the United States also will take some
measures in releasing our frozen assets.''
   Velayati, asked about the relationship between hostages and
assets, said: ``It is not our duty to talk about hostages who are
kept in Lebanon, which is another country. Some countries ask us to
help about hostages and that is based on reciprocity.''
   Sixteen foreign hostages, including eight Americans, are being
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalist groups and
Iran is believed to wield influence with them. Longest held is
Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, who was abducted 4{ years ago.
   Velayati emphasized the new Iranian government, believed more
pragmatic and intent on economic reconstruction, ``is against any
hostage-taking and holding innocent persons hostage.'' For several
years, he said, Iran has exerted considerable effort to help some
countries with hostages in Lebanon.
   Velayati, asked about prospects for better relations with the
United States, said that from the beginning of the Iranian
revolution in the late 1970s the United States ``has had hostility
against us and still continues the same policies.''

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Supreme Court on Friday rejected
former Gov. Evan Mecham's lawsuit seeking reinstatement and more
than $600,000 in back pay and expenses.
   The court said it no power to overrule the state Senate which
removed the first-term Republican from office last year when it
convicted him on civil impeachment charges he misused money in a
state protocol fund and tried to obstruct an investigation.
   Mecham told a news conference the decision ``invited legislative
anarchy.'' He said he might appeal to federal courts but only if he
could raise $150,000. Otherwise, he said, he'll take his case back
to the people in running again for governor next year.
   ``Justice in Arizona today can only be found with the people at
large, certainly not with the justice system,'' he said, adding,
``This is a war, not a battle.''
   Some of the money issues raised in Mecham's state Supreme Court
case are also the subject of a lower court lawsuit, and the
justices said Mecham could continue to pursue them there or in the
Legislature which can authorize payments itself.
   His lawyer argued that the protocol fund statute was drafted
unconstitutionally and that senators were allowed to vote on the
charges without having heard all the evidence or agreeing on what
the exact charges were.
   But the justices said the Senate was free to impeach Mecham for
his general course of conduct whether or not the conduct violated
any particular statute and whether or not the statute was
unconstitutional.
   Because impeachment trials are political in nature, courts have
no right to interfere as long as lawmakers follow the few rules for
impeachment set forth in the Arizona Constitution, they added.
   Aides to Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, the elected Secretary of
State who assumed office after Mecham's ouster on April l4, 1988.

   NASA on Friday named astronaut crews
for five space shuttle missions, including the first black woman
selected for space flight.
   Dr. Mae C. Jemison, 32, a physician, was assigned as a mission
specialist to a June 1991 flight aboard shuttle Discovery. The
mission is to conduct life sciences and materials processing
experiments.
   Dr. Jemison was born in Decatur, Ala., but considers Chicago,
where her parents live, to be her hometown. She received a bachelor
of science degree in chemical engineering from Stanford University
in 1977 and a doctorate in medicine degree from Cornell University
in 1981.
   She was working with CIGNA Health Plans of California and as a
general practicioner in Los Angeles when selected for the astronaut
program in 1985.
   Named to fly with Dr. Jemison were Air Force Col. Mark C. Lee
and N. Jan Davis. Other crew members will be picked later.
   Astronauts were named for flights in late 1990 and early 1991.
   Navy Capt. Richard N. Richards will command an October 1990
Atlantis mission which will dispatch the Ulysses spacecraft to
study the sun. The others are Marine Lt. Col. Robert D. Cabana,
Navy Capt. William M. Shepherd, Coast Guard Cmdr. Bruce E. Melnick
and Air Force Maj. Thomas D. Akers. Melnick is the first Coast
Guard astronaut picked for a flight.
   Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats will command the crew of Discovery
on an unclassified Defense Department mission set for November
1990. The others are Air Force Maj. L. Blaine Hammond Jr., Gregory
J. Harbaugh and Air Force Maj. Donald R. McMonagle. Previously
assigned to this mission were Air Force Col. Guion S. Bluford Jr.,
Richard J. Hieb and Charles Lacy Veach.
   Kathryn D. Sullivan and C. Michael Foale were named to a March
1991 flight aboard Columbia which is to study the sun and Earth's
atmosphere. Picked earlier for this flight were Michael L. Lampton
and Byron K. Lichtenberg. Others will be named later.
   Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson will command Atlantis on a May 1991
flight which will deploy and then retrieve a package of science
instruments developed by the European Space Agency. Claude
Nicollier, a European Space Agency astronaut, will be a crew
member, as will NASA astronauts Jeffrey A. Hoffman and Franklin R.
Chang-Diaz, a native of Costa Rica who has made one shuttle flight
and is training for another set for launch next month.

<HEAD>Syrian Shellings Killed Millions of Fish off Christian Enclave</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six months of Syrian shellings have
killed millions of fish in the Mediterranean off this Christian
enclave near Beirut and threatened one of Lebanon's few natural
resources, a government ecologist says.
   The shellings stopped with the recent cease-fire in the battle
for Beirut but damage to the fish population and the livelihoods of
local fishermen remain critical.
   ``Our sea is dying,'' ecologist Pierre Malichev of the Health
Ministry said in an interview. ``It's become rotten and polluted.
Our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next
year.''
   He estimated that along with the millions of fish killed,
billions of their eggs also perished.
   Malichev said fish not killed by the hundreds of exploding 130mm
howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets were poisoned by tetryl, one
of the explosive elements in the shells that is released into the
water.
   The shellings also forced most of the enclave's 500 fishermen to
remain ashore.
   But about 75 of them risked going out after dark to gather the
thousands of fish that would float up dead on the surface after
each shelling.
   ``After a heavy round of shelling, the dead fish float like a
carpet on the surface,'' fishermen Sirop Ornakian said before the
cease-fire took effect.
   ``We usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet. Most times
I collect about 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of fish every trip.''
   The Syrians shelled the 28-mile coastal enclave and its waters
to keep cargo ships and tankers from running a blockade with
supplies for the Christian forces of Gen. Michel Aoun in the battle
of Beirut.
   ``The shelling has killed our season,'' said Kivork Manoukian, a
fisherman for more than 40 years. ``Usually this time of the year
is the best for us, when we make some money. But this year's been
catastrophic.''
   His friend, Arten Khishkhishian, said he gave up fishing because
his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of shrapnel
littering the shallow waters off Jounieh and the ancient port of
Byblos a few miles north.
   ``I've had to repair my net three times and that cost more than
100,000 pounds ($200),'' he said. ``I decided to stop this
`shrapnel fishing' until there's lasting peace.''
   But the others risked their lives and their boats, 15-foot craft
powered by outboard motors, to haul in the dead fish. Sometimes a
Syrian barrage would come unexpectedly. Police said several
fishermen were wounded.
   Kevork Manoukian said that on one night ``it looked quiet so I
dropped my net.''
   ``Then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my
boat,'' he said. ``I ditched my net and made it for the shore in
panic as more shells exploded around me.''
   Ornakian and other fishermen went out regularly for catches not
much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting.
   With fish in short supply in the enclave, the price has doubled
to the equivalent of about $4.50 a pound.
   Ornakian and the others reckon that the money they made from
each trip _ the equivalent in Lebanese pounds of about $250 _ was
worth the chance.
   Moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off Beirut, where
the Syrians deployed batteries of long-range artillery along the
waterfront to shell the Christian coastline.
   But the Moslems are able to fish south of Beirut for 50 miles
down the coast to the ancient port of Tyre, where the biggest
danger they face is an occasional Israeli gunboat.

<HEAD>Leaked Files Causing Uproar in Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious rash of leaked
security files has led to new accusations that Northern Ireland's
embattled security forces are cooperating with Protestant murder
squads.
   The British government is embarrassed, the Irish government is
expressing dismay, and the Irish Republican Army is enjoying a
propaganda windfall in its war to rid Northern Ireland of British
rule.
   Desperate to build credibility with the deeply suspicious
Catholic minority, the police force has taken the drastic step of
calling in 19 detectives from England to conduct an independent
inquiry into the source of the leaks.
   The affair began Aug. 29, when British Broadcasting Corp.
reporter Chris Moore was taken blindfolded to meet four masked men
who had files and a videotape to show.
   The men claimed to belong to the Ulster Freedom Fighters, a
shadowy Protestant organization that specializes in killing
Catholics. Four days earlier the group had killed Loughlin Maginn,
a 38-year-old Catholic father of four.
   The masked men said they wanted to convince the reporter that
Maginn was on file as an IRA suspect and was not an innocent victim.
   If, as the Ulster group claimed, the files came from the
security forces, then how did they fall into the hands of an
illegal and murderous organization?
   The furor has worsened in the ensuing weeks as at least eight
more security files have surfaced. The files consist mainly of
sheets of photos with names and addresses of IRA suspects.
   In the hands of the police or army, the files are routine
anti-terrorism documents. In the hands of the Protestant group,
they are death lists.
   ``This is an intolerable situation,'' said Seamus Mallon, a
leading politician in Northern Ireland who, while consistently
critical of the security forces, has in the past urged fellow
Catholics to cooperate with police investigations of IRA outrages.
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, has long claimed that
collusion exists between the security forces and Protestant groups.
Mallon, who belongs to the more moderate Social Democratic and
Labor Party, says the fact that files are leaking out of security
bases all over the province points to a widespread problem.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, has
published a statement by its chief constable, Hugh Annesley, in all
Belfast's daily newspapers.
   ``The RUC (police) will not tolerate wrongdoing, should it be
uncovered in its own ranks, or flinch from tackling it in any other
branch of the security forces, or anywhere in society,'' the
statement said.
   Some lists have come to Mallon, others have gone straight to the
media. At least two disappeared from police stations, and two more
from bases of the locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment.
   In most cases they have been mailed without explanation, but
one, sent to a Scottish newspaper, came from a former soldier who
said he wanted to show how easy it was to obtain such documents.
   Another, sent anonymously to a London newspaper, The
Independent, included the names of 25 people living in the Irish
Republic. This added a fresh dimension to the controversy because
it suggests that intelligence collected by Irish police and shared
with colleagues across the border may also be available to the
murder squads.
   Deputy Chief Constable John Stevens, the English policeman
leading investigations of the leaks, said Thursday that a British
soldier serving in West Germany was returned to his former posting
in Northern Ireland after being questioned about leaked
intelligence. Details were not available. Stevens also announced
his inquiry team of 15 was strengthened to 19.
   Critics say some of those listed are simply victims of mistaken
identity.
   ``One is a well-known businessman with no connection with
subversive activity, and at least six of the addresses published
are wrong, which puts the lives of innocent people in jeopardy,''
Joe O'Neill of Sinn Fein told a news conference.
   The affair reflects the blurred line between law and lawlessness
in a province where 20 years of conflict have spawned an array of
illegal ``paramilitary'' outfits of Catholic republicans and
Protestants loyal to Britain.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary knows it can isolate the IRA only
with the cooperation of Catholics, and it has made strenuous
efforts to shed its old sectarian image.
   Its statistics show that last year, more Protestants than
Catholics were charged with murder, even though Catholics committed
three times more murders.
   Indeed, one theory holds that the Protestants have chosen to
publicize their alleged links with the security forces in
retaliation for the Royal Ulster Constabulary's crackdown on their
racketeering activities.

   They no longer wear white uniforms with roses
in their lapels, but every litter bit still counts to Baltimore's
pushcart street sweepers, who pick up where mechanical street
sweepers leave off.
   So popular are the 110 men and women who sweep, shovel and spiff
up the city's sidewalks and gutters that when one of them takes a
vacation or sick leave, it's not unusual for residents to call the
city and ask where they are.
   The city calls them ``hokey men'' _ regardless of their sex _
because of their compact ``hokey carts'' stocked with cleaning
tools and paper trash bags. No one seems to remember how the carts
got their name.
   Their job is to tidy the corners and crevices that the street
sweepers can't reach. They bag autumn leaves, shovel snow and
harvest the summer's crop of used Popsicle sticks and other trash.
They sweep between parked cars and scoop cigarette butts out of the
cracks in the sidewalk.
   Baltimore, which was incorporated in 1796, is by no means
spotless, and its age shows in many places. Nevertheless, public
works officials in other Eastern cities are envious of Baltimore's
cleanliness and the attention lavished on its public spaces by the
hokey cart operators, said James Kapplin, executive director of the
city's Public Works Museum.
   ``It seems in the 20th century that it's a very antique way to
do things,'' Kapplin said. ``But it's really the only way to keep
the city clean, if you want to do the total job.''
   Nowadays, they fill out civil service applications and don
fluorescent orange T-shirts or overalls before setting out to erase
the evidence of urban carelessness. But a century ago, men had to
earn their way into an elite street cleaning corps known formally
as the White Wings and informally as the Beauty Squad.
   ``From the days we were settled and through the 18th century,
roving bands of pigs and dogs cleaned the streets. There weren't
any government services,'' said Kapplin.
   That was changed by George Waring, who became New York City's
commissioner of street cleaning in 1885 and transformed a menial
task into an honorable calling by forming the first refuse patrols,
according to museum officials.
   Inspired by Waring's initiative, Baltimore's White Wings were
organized about the turn of the century. Each man on the Beauty
Squad wore white duck trousers, a white jacket studded with brass
buttons and a cork helmet. The $5 cost of the uniform came out of
the men's $10 weekly salaries, according to museum officials. Some
men added a natty touch by wearing a rose boutonniere.
   Sadly, Kapplin said, respect for the elite squad declined around
1920, after the special uniforms wore out and were replaced by drab
gray outfits. But the hokey men who evolved carry on the same
tradition, he said.
   ``They're very proud. They're career people.''
   Actually, the job is considered an entry-level position, paying
a starting wage of $7.46 to $8.89 an hour. But some of the hokey
men like the work so much they never leave it.
   ``I'm the type of person who likes to work outside. I get to
meet people,'' said Harold Murdock, a 16-year hokey veteran. ``To
me it's a great job.''
   Gregory Goods has belonged to the group only since last
December, but he's already got a pet peeve: ``It bothers me when
one car parks with its front end all the way over the sidewalk and
you can't clean the space. Then when they leave, it spoils the
whole area, makes it look like an eyesore.''
   Nine hokey carts are detailed to the downtown area. The rest are
sprinkled along heavily traveled streets and in neighborhoods
throughout the city.
   The street cleaners develop a sense of belonging in the
neighborhoods they patrol, and the feeling is often mutual, said
Orville A. Swafford, head of the Bureau of Solid Waste.
   ``If a hokey man is sick, we get loads of calls from people
saying, `Where is our hokey man?''' Swafford said. ``Also, there
was one who works on Baltimore Street who came back on his vacation
to make sure his `customers' were being served.''

   A civilian Defense Department employee dying of
cancer in California wants to spend his last days in Massachusetts
where he grew up. But the Air Force, despite pressure from Congress
and a White House aide, refuses to provide an air ambulance ride
home.
   Even if regulations permitted the flight, the Air Force says,
someone would have to pay for it, and it could cost more than a
civilian air ambulance.
   Avram Brody was in and out of a coma Thursday at his home in
Palmdale, Calif., about 45 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. The
25-year-old native of Norwood learned he had an inoperable brain
tumor a year ago, just weeks before he was married.
   He was a Defense Department computer operator for three years,
working on such projects as the B-2 stealth bomber at Edwards Air
Force Base. In July, doctors estimated he had a few weeks to live.
   Brody wants to die in his home state where most of his friends
and relatives live. But the latest estimate from a private air
ambulance company is that it would cost $29,000 to fly him coast to
coast.
   The Air Force, citing regulations, refuses to take on the job.
   ``I understand their position, that they just can't pick up and
take anybody,'' Brody's wife, Amy, said in a telephone interview.
``But by the same token he worked for them. He worked for his
country, defending his country and they're not helping him in his
time of need.''
   Not for lack of influential help have the Brodys failed to move
the Air Force off its position.
   Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., on the powerful Rules Committee,
and Rep. Nicholas Mavroulas, D-Mass., a member of the Armed
Services Committee, have made inquiries. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
has been contacted. Andrew Card, a native of Holbrook and a top
aide to White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, has his staff
working on the case.
   But the Air Force is firm.
   Air Force Maj. Fran Tunstall, a press spokesman based in
Washington, said Brody might qualify for an airlift home if his
illness were caused by his government work, if the trip were
necessary to receive some special medical treatment, or if there
were some chance for survival.
   But even if Brody met those criteria, he would have to pay for
the flight and Tunstall estimated the cost at $30,000, since it
would involve a special trip for a plane stationed in Illinois.
   Only if Brody were a uniformed officer whose medical situation
was a life-or-death emergency could Brody be eligible for a free
flight, he said.
   Tunstall said the Air Force was sensitive to Brody's plight but
had to draw the line somewhere on transporting government employees
_ particularly when the flight involved costly medical preparations.
   ``This isn't a greed factor,'' he said.
   ``It just seems so cold and heartless,'' said state Rep. Gregory
Sullivan, who has been trying to help the Brody family.
   Mrs. Brody, 25, said her husband's medical problems began to
crop up a few months before they were married, but they went ahead
with the ceremony.
   ``We had planned on getting married and we didn't want to
disrupt the event,'' she said.
   Going to Massachusetts also would make her life easier. Brody
would be able to stay in a hospital for the terminally ill not far
from his mother's home. Now, he is bedridden at home and Mrs. Brody
has had to stop working to care for him.
   One of the public officials working on the case is Brad Pearson,
a client advocate for the Massachusetts Office of Handicapped
Affairs.
   ``His wife is having to cope with the ultimate horror of seeing
their joint future destroyed by a cruel death,'' Pearson said.
``The question I would raise is this: Is elementary compassion too
much to ask?''

   Irene O'Neil, 86, of Mandan, said after getting the check
Thursday she wasn't sure exactly how she would spend the money.
   ``I haven't any idea,'' she said. ``But I have eight
grandchildren and two sons, and I'm sure I can find some place for
it.''
   Mrs. O'Neil was getting monthly Social Security check based on
the earnings of her late husband when she remarried in 1972.
   Under a law passed two years later, her benefits should have
been raised to reflect the higher earnings of her second husband,
said Bruce Haugen, an aide to Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.,
   ``Social Security searched for people eligible, but she fell
through the cracks,'' Haugen said. ``There turned out to be a
couple of snags in the application, and her Social Security file
was lost.''
   Mrs. O'Neil heard she might be eligible for more money and
contacted the congressman's office in July, which got Social
Security to recalculate her benefits, Haugen said.

   Talk-show host Larry King is about to be married
for the third time, but he doesn't consider himself a two-time
loser _ the losers are those who marry only once, he says.
   ``We are shocked when people marry several times, but if society
would admit it, the truth is that many couples who've been married
50 years probably met other people and were afraid to move on,''
King, 55, writes in the Sept. 29-Oct. 1 issue of ``USA Weekend.''
   King is confident his marriage to Julie Alexander, 41, who runs
a lawyer-recruitment firm in Philadelphia, will last.
   ``What Julie and I both know _ and this is what experience gives
you _ is there can never be anything after this, or anything as
strong,'' he said.
   King says he married his first wife, Alene, ``because in '61 you
got married if you wanted a family.'' They divorced after having
one daughter, King said, because ``we really never understood each
other.''
   He married his second wife, Sharon, in 1976. That marriage
didn't work, he said, because they competed for attention.
   His relationship with Alexander, who is once-divorced, is
different, King says.
   ``This will be the first time I'm walking down the aisle with
not only someone I love but also someone I adore and who is my
friend,'' he said.

   Marlon Brando's performance as a trial lawyer
battling South Africa's apartheid system in ``A Dry White Season''
won a thumbs-up from the man considered to be the inspiration for
the role.
   ``He's a great actor, and I was truly moved,'' George Bizos, a
lawyer who has handled some of South Africa's most famous political
cases, said Thursday.
   Bizos represented Nelson Mandela in 1963 when the nationalist
leader was sentenced to life in prison, and was involved in the
inquiry into the death of black activist Steven Biko in 1976.
   Bizos, who was attending a conference this week examining a
post-apartheid constitution for South Africa, said the film
portrays ``a compressed reality'' of life in the country.
   ``It's improbable that all those things happened to just two
families,'' he said, ``but all the events in the film have happened
to South Africans.''

   Sotheby's is holding its first horse auction
this weekend, putting 98 of entertainer Wayne Newton's prized
Arabian horses on the block.
   The sale Saturday evening at Newton's plush Casa de Shenandoah
ranch, on the city's southwest side, should bring in about
$750,000, said Sealy Rodger, a Sotheby's spokesman.
   Newton has been breeding Arabian horses for 25 years and is
raising a herd of more than 250 on his ranch at Logandale,
northwest of Las Vegas.
   Newton's ``Aramus'' herd, named after a favorite Polish national
champion stallion owned by the entertainer, is considered one of

   Reagan was to have spoken at the California Grocers Association
annual conference here Monday.
   ``To be on the safe side, his physicians have recommended he not
travel away from Los Angeles until the second week in October,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said Thursday.
   Weinberg said Reagan's recuperation ``continues to go well and

   Mark Harmon made no secret of his admiration

   ``I'm a tremendous fan of hers, and I told her that right from

think she's always wanted to play Alexandra Del Lago,'' a fading
movie queen who hooks up with a gigolo played by Harmon.
   An actor's goal should be to reach a level where you can ``work
with the great people and say the great words,'' Harmon said,
adding he got the chance to do that working opposite Taylor in the
TV drama, which will air Sunday on NBC.
   Harmon, 38, said he deliberately seeks parts that play against
his clean-cut good looks to avoid being typecast in lighter roles.
   ``People in this business love to find a niche for you. But I

<HEAD>Foreign School Aid Program Has Grown Into `Pork Barrel,' Congressmen
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several key members of Congress say it's time
to overhaul a $35 million grant program which is supposed to help
American-sponsored schools and hospitals abroad, but now is a
``foreign affairs pork barrel.''
   Their assertion is backed up by internal State Department
records that show that administration officials routinely bend the
rules in the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program in
response to pressure from Capitol Hill.
   ``My interest is in getting people to rethink the program,''
said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on the Middle East, the region where many of the
program abuses are occurring. ``It's become a kind of foreign
affairs pork barrel.''
   Hamilton and Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., showed their displeasure
with the 28-year-old program by ordering the Agency for
International Development, which runs it, to withdraw a $1.5
million grant intended for an ultra-orthodox Israeli school that
trains teachers for other religious schools.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, has acknowledged he intervened to help an
Israeli school get a grant, but said he now believes the process is
out of hand.
   ``The competition has become too fierce,'' he said. ``We now
have the undignified prospect of individuals approaching senators
and members of Congress'' to lobby for their schools. ``We did not
envision this kind of political competition.''
   Most of the complaints about political interference involve
schools with heavily religious orientations, particularly Jewish
institutions.
   The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last year
alleging that the program violated the constitutional separation of
church and state. The lawsuit names 20 Roman Catholic and Jewish
schools that received grants, most of them because of political
pressure.
   Most ASHA grants remain in line with the program's aim, which is
to showcase U.S. achievements in education and medicine overseas.
The American University of Beirut, the American University in Cairo
and the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, recipients of
continuing aid, are often cited as success stories.
   But the rules for awarding grants state that ``assistance may
not be used to train persons for religious pursuits or to construct
buildings or other facilities intended for worship or religious
instruction.''
   Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations foreign operations
subcommittee, and Hamilton ordered AID earlier this month to scotch
a $1.5 million grant for Sha'Alvim Teachers College in Israel and
redirect the money to other institutions by Saturday, the end of
the fiscal year.
   The aim of the college, an ultra-orthodox Jewish institution, is
to train rabbis and teachers who would work in settlements in areas
such as the occupied West Bank. Such a goal would be at odds with
U.S. policy, which opposes Israel's settlement policy in the
occupied lands.
   Despite its apparent ineligibility, the school was put on the
``approved'' grant list after intervention by Sen. Robert Kasten,
R-Wis., according to State Department records and congressional
sources.
   In another case, the American College of Belz in Israel had been
turned down for grants almost annually from 1980 through 1984, its
request ranked near the bottom of the merit list by independent
reviewers.
   But in 1985, AID administrator Peter McPherson awarded the
school a $500,000 grant ``without reference to the results of the
FY 1985 review process,'' according to an admission the department
filed in the ACLU lawsuit.
   ``The grant was made because Sen. (Alfonse) D'Amato strongly
expressed the view that the grant should be made and exerted
pressure on AID to get it to make the grant,'' the document stated.
   The grant was approved even though the application had been
filed a full year after the deadline, the department said.
   D'Amato, R-N.Y., is on the Senate Appropriations Committee,
which approves money for AID programs, a fact that ``influenced Mr.
McPherson,'' the department said.
   Telephone calls to D'Amato's office were not immediately
returned.
   A spokesman for Kasten, Jim Sims, said the senator was not alone
in backing the Sha'Alvim school and said it was unfair to single
him out. ``To my knowledge, there was no opposition in the
Senate,'' he said. And he contended Kasten was simply supporting
the AID administrator's action, rather than influencing it.
   The program receives requests for as much as three times the
amount of aid its budget allows. When projects near the bottom of
the list are made eligible through exercise of political might,
institutions higher on the list lose out.
   Among other lawmakers named in the documents as applying
pressure to make institutions eligible are Sens. Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.; James Sasser,
D-Tenn.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; and Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.
   Inouye was criticized two years ago when it was revealed he
sought to funnel $8 million to a French school for African Jews. He
was forced to rescind the grant after it generated public
controversy.
   In a letter to Mark Edelman, acting AID administrator, Obey and
Hamilton warned they planned to closely monitor the program.
   ``We ... may well object if changes are not made in the coming
year,'' they wrote.

   The fight over President Bush's cut in the
capital gains tax moves quickly to the Senate and into electoral
politics following the president's hard-fought victory in the House.
   A high-profile Democratic effort to derail the tax break, which
party leaders called a giveaway to the rich, was beaten 239-190 on
Thursday. The Democratic alternative contained a tax increase on
the wealthy, and 64 Democrats defected to the president's side.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
Bush's House victory ``wasn't unexpected'' but that he would try to
buck Bush with an alternative of his own when his committee meets
next week.
   Bentsen, a longtime supporter of special tax treatment for
capital gains earnings, says the nation can't afford to give away
too many new tax breaks with federal deficits running at $130
billion a year.
   However, others in the Senate were certain to push for the
capital gains cut.
   The Bentsen plan would restore universally deductible Individual
Retirement Accounts, an idea the House Democrats' proposal also
embraced. But his plan doesn't include their proposal to raise
income taxes on the wealthy, who now pay a lower marginal rate than
the upper middle class.
   Setting a lower tax rate for capital gains, which Bush promised
in his presidential campaign, would reverse what was considered a
major achievement of the 1986 tax overhaul supported by President
Reagan _ taxing earned and unearned income at the same rate.
   The Bush plan approved Thursday as part of a huge, 2,000-page
budget bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on capital gains from
33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months. After that, the
rate would rise to 28 percent, but taxes would not be paid on
earnings attributable to inflation.
   ``A lower capital gains rate will reduce the cost of capital and
create incentives for investment in the long-term productive
capacity of American industry,'' Bush said in hailing Thursday's
vote.
   Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the plan ``a
$25,000-a-year tax cut on average to 375,000 American families _
the wealthiest families in America _ for some decision they already
made'' and not for new investment.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the Democrats took
the correct position even though they lost and he would continue
the fight.
   ``This is not the end of the process. It is the beginning,'' he
said.
   In the House, the capital gains fight was just one of many in
the bill, which will continue to occupy the chamber most of next
week. Other, less partisan battles are expected then on whether to
repeal the Medicare catastrophic illness insurance plan, and on new
federal support for child care.
   Regardless of the eventual fate of the bill, the political
implications of the vote will linger.
   John Buckley, spokesman for the House GOP's campaign
organization, said his telephone facsimile machines were humming
with press releases tagging any Democrats who supported their party
as voting for a tax increase and against jobs and prosperity.
   ``This is one of those votes that you lie awake waiting for, and
we got it,'' he said, adding that it would be brought up again for
the 1990 elections.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said Democrats also gained issues _
the IRA, the federal deficit and the economy.
   ``Both parties right now are plowing, fertilizing and seeding
the fields'' for next year, he said.

   ``It's a shame to see what's happening to our own people,''

   ``Poverty is black, it's white, it's brown, it's red and it's
painful, and we're here to do something about it,'' said radio show
host Casey Kasem, who recently established his hotel penthouse as a
command center in the battle against homelessness.
   The rally was to drum up support for an Oct. 7 homeless rights
march on the nation's capital.
   Other celebrities on hand were actresses Rosana Desoto, Ana
Alicia, Eileen Davidson and Lanie Kazan; comedian Paul Rodriguez;
radio announcer Shadoe Stephens; and actors Bob Saget and Joe Spano.
   ``There are people in the street, people who are hungry, babies
who take showers in fountains in the park,'' said Miss Desoto, who
co-starred in the movie ``La Bamba.''
   ``We're going to turn it around and we're going to start
today,'' she said.
   After the rally, a bus carrying 47 people set off for Salt Lake
City, where the travelers are expected to join a caravan going to
the Washington, D.C., march.

   President Bush's powerful victory on the
capital gains tax calls into question whether House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley and his Democratic leadership team can marshal something
more important than personal popularity _ votes.
   On an issue where the Democrats themselves drew the line in the
sand, calling the president's position a gift to his rich friends,
64 of their own members crossed over to the other side. The
Democrats gave Bush the votes he needed for his 239-190 win on
Thursday.
   ``It puts a big dent in the leadership's new car,'' said Rep.
Pat Williams, D-Mont. ``And you remember that first dent the
longest.''
   The defections cast doubt on whether Foley and his team, who
took over just three months ago from their scandal-plagued
predecessors, chose the right issue on which to confront Bush,
since many Democrats were already supporting a capital gains tax
cut as a boon to the economy.
   The vote also raised questions of political lethargy _ whether
the Democrats could have headed off the loss. The process of
putting together a Democratic alternative was agonizingly slow and
public, completed less than a week before the decisive vote.
   The alternate proposal to expand Individual Retirement Accounts
included a tax increase. Democrats argued that it applied only to
the nation's 600,000 wealthiest taxpayers, but it still was the
political equivalent of taping a ``kick me'' sign on Democratic
members' backs.
   Senate Finance Committee Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, steered clear
of that one when he raised the idea of reviving universal IRAs as
an alternative to Bush's tax cut. Bentsen's panel begins working on
the tax issue next week.
   Foley brushed aside the problems as he met with reporters to
analyze the vote, saying he was ``comfortable'' with the outcome.
``I think it is a proud day. I am satisfied we took a correct
position,'' he said.
   Foley's Democratic opponents on the vote were quick to express
their admiration of him and discomfort with having to go against
their leadership.
   ``I regret it. I've not enjoyed this at all,'' said Rep. Mike
Andrews, D-Texas, who was one of the six Democrats who started the
ball rolling by supporting Bush in the Ways and Means Committee.
``I don't think you can just blame the leadership.''
   Andrews and other Democrats said there was little resemblance in
this vote to 1981, when Democrats held news conferences to decry
their leadership and vote with President Reagan.
   Any analogy to 1981, when the House passed Reagan's economic
plan with the help of renegade Democratic ``boll weevils,'' has
some major weaknesses. Reagan was riding high in the polls then, as
Bush is now, but seemed to have a greater ability to appeal
directly to Americans on teleision.
   ``I don't think this is (because of) Bush,'' said Rep. Vic
Fazio, D-Calif., vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
``Compared to Ronald Reagan, this is not a guy who brings sweat to
a brow of a member of Congress. ... this is nothing like that.''
   But Democrats have to worry, as Republicans were all but
gloating over the possibility that Bush will enjoy a kinder and
gentler version of the politics that led to Reagan's big victories.
   Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip, was
plenty comfortable with that scenario. He declared that the GOP now
has a working majority in the House, because the Democratic
leadership was representing a liberal wing out of step with most
Americans.
   White House budget director Richard Darman, bubbling after the
vote, said that ``if we conduct ourselves well, there's an
opportunity to use some elements of the same coalition on other
issues.''
   Democrats tried to play down that scenario, saying capital gains
was an issue where many Democrats had long-fixed feelings that a
lower capital gains rate would help boost the economy.
   But there was almost no evidence that the Democratic leadership
had ``gently persuaded,'' in Foley's words, any significant number
to change their minds and back the party.
   The complex politics of the Capitol can always produce a silver
lining, though.
   Although Foley fell short, one top Democratic aide chuckled that
the leadership forced Bush to deliver pork-barrel goodies to many
Democrats in order to keep their votes.
   ``He had to help our guys get re-elected in exchange for his
legislative victory,'' he said.

<HEAD>FHA Losses Combine Worst of S&amp;L, HUD Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massive losses in the FHA insurance fund
appear to combine the worst of the savings and loan crisis and the
federal housing scandal, and taxpayers again may wind up footing
the bill, congressional investigators say.
   The FHA losses _ half of them attributed to fraud and
mismanagement _ have swelled the cost of the scandal at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development almost overnight from
$2.2 billion to $6.9 billion, officials said Thursday.
   The new estimate results from the disclosure that the
department's Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance
program lost $4.2 billion in 1988 alone.
   ``With the S&amp;Ls, the farm credit system and now FHA, it seems to
me there was almost a government meltdown in the 1980s,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., head of a special House Budget Committee
task force on potential fiscal crises, said at a hearing Thursday.
   Schumer, whose panel is examining taxpayer exposure to abuses in
several supposedly fee-based, self-financed government insurance
programs, said the FHA losses ``combine the worst of the S&amp;L fiasco
and the HUD scandals.''
   ``The American people again may be left holding the bag for
billions of dollars of waste, mismanagement, fraud and abuse,'' he
said. Schumer said the loss figure was a conservative estimate.
   ``It sounds like a reasonable estimate to me,'' Paul Adams,
HUD's inspector general, told the panel.
   Comptroller General Charles Bowsher told the panel the chief
causes of the FHA mortgage insurance losses totaling $4.2 billion
last year were the same as those that set off the S&amp;L crisis that
will cost taxpayers a minimum of $157 billion under a bill passed
by Congress last month.
   Some of the shortfall stemmed from homeowners in economically
strapped areas of the country being unable to make their house
payments, Bowsher said.
   But he said at least half of it was due to mismanagement at HUD,
plus fraud and undercapitalization by private insurers who started
writing FHA coverage in 1983 under the Reagan administration's
efforts to privatize the program.
   ``You have to monitor what's happening in the private sector
when you delegate to the private sector,'' Bowsher said. ``It's
just like the S&amp;Ls.''
   ``We don't know what's happening with the programs,'' he said.
``Our budgeting and accounting systems are on a cash basis. So no
one has to report a problem until they have to write a check.
There's a culture of not bringing up bad news.''
   Not that some officials didn't try. Adams had written several
reports on abuses of HUD programs before one last spring grabbed
the attention of a House subcommittee and subsequently the media.
   Only since 1986, Bowsher said, has HUD modernized its accounting
systems enough for the General Accounting Office that he heads to
even perform an audit of FHA programs. Without that modernization,
it would have been at least another two years before the $4.2
billion losses in 1988 would have surfaced.
   Adams said a dozen ongoing audits by his office and more than
600 active investigations into FHA activities ``confirm that many
abuses are continuing.''
   Despite several changes ordered by Congress in 1987, such as
requiring higher down payments and more creditworthiness reviews,
he said, ``We continue to uncover schemes to defraud the program.''
   About $960 million of the FHA loss was attributed to the
so-called co-insurance program initiated by HUD in 1983.
   Basically, it allows private lenders to write FHA insurance
coverage for 80 percent of a mortgage, assuming only 20 percent of
the risk themselves but collecting large fees up front in the form
of points.
   But because many private lenders have little or no money of
their own at risk as capital in the enterprises, the government
often gets stuck for the full tab if the borrower defaults.
   House investigators cited instances of companies writing
federally insured mortgages totaling $300 million with as little
capital as $1 million.
   The FBI is now investigating two of those companies _ DRG

insurance but was always rebuffed.

   The Senate put itself on record early Friday
against legislation banning federal financial support for
``obscene'' art, reversing a vote taken two months ago.
   By 62-35, the lawmakers rejected a non-binding measure that
voiced the Senate's backing for the prohibition. It was the first
time senators had been forced to disclose in the record vote their
preferences in the issue.
   The vote was taken after the ban's sponsor, Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., invited senators to view photographs he brought to the
Senate floor that he said were obscene.
   At one point, he said he would seek to have the chamber cleared
of ``all the pages, all the staff and all the ladies'' so lawmakers
could view the pictures. But he did not follow up and the room was
not cleared.
   Some lawmakers who oppose the Helms amendment have been eager to
avoid a roll call vote on it, fearing that it could be used against
them later.
   ``What 30-second ad might come out of this?'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said was a popular question among senators. ``Senator
so-and-so voted for pornography.''
   Helms introduced his amendment in July after being angered that
the National Endowment for the Arts had paid $45,000 for a pair of
exhibitions. One included photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe depicting homoerotic acts and the genitalia of
children. The other showed a photograph by Andres Serrano of a
crucifix in a jar of urine.
   The Senate approved the ban July 26 on a voice vote in a nearly
empty chamber, attaching it to the $11 billion appropriations bill
for the Interior Department and related agencies that carries
government arts appropriations.
   The House never adopted the provision, voting 264-153 against on
Sept. 13. Instead, the House voted a cut of $45,000 for the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   House-Senate negotiators, trying to work out a compromise,
appear on the verge of watering it down, which angered Helms.
Friday's vote was on an amendment to the Defense appropriations
bill which would have directed Senate members of the Interior
conference committee to stand fast for the ban.
   The amendment would prohibit the use of federal money to exhibit
``obscene or indecent materials, including but not limited to
depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the exploitation of
children, or individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   It also bars federal aid for material that ``denigrates'' people
based on their religion, race, sex, handicap, age or ethnic origin.

   Hundreds of residents queued up Thursday
to apply for money from the largest disaster-relief package ever
approved by Congress, and President Bush announced he would tour
areas devastated by Hurricane Hugo.
   As Charleston's airport reopened for the first time since last
week's storm, providing another channel for aid, some officials
criticized the government for creating a bottleneck by opening only
five Federal Emergency Management Agency centers.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said limiting Charleston
itself to two FEMA offices was ``absolutely ridiculous.''
   ``We should have a couple of centers in rural counties. We ought
to have several centers in the urban counties,'' he added.
   In another development, Charleston County authorities early
Friday withdrew a report that the bodies of four more victims of
Hugo were found beneath a collapsed house.
   Mike Spurgeon, night supervisor for the county Emergency Medical
Service, said search dogs had picked up four scents in the fishing
village of McClellanville, and the state Law Enforcement Division
officer near the scene mistakenly reported that as four bodies.
   ``He misunderstood. It was four contacts. There are no four
additional deaths in McCllellanville,'' said Spurgeon, adding that
a dead animal or clothes with human scents could have triggered the
dogs.
   Bush planned to make a pre-dawn flight on Friday to Charleston,
which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135-mph winds, but he would have to
complete his tour by mid-morning in order to leave for Annapolis,
Md., the White House said.
   ``We need him to understand how deep the human suffering is in
this,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said. ``I want him to know that it's
a long haul for us, and it's not a quick fix.''
   As Charleston's airport reopened for the first time since last
week's storm, providing another channel for aid, some officials
criticized the government for creating a bottleneck by opening only
five Federal Emergency Management Agency centers.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said limiting Charleston
itself to two FEMA offices was ``absolutely ridiculous.''
   ``We should have a couple of centers in rural counties. We ought
to have several centers in the urban counties,'' he added.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in Charleston to visit shelters housing
those displaced by the storm, urged that Bush ``not just come and
visit a house or two but to come with a plan and resources.''
   Jackson told reporters ``there is no sense of the massive
federal presence that people deserve,'' but praised local residents
``who have the good sense to turn to each other and not on each
other.''
   Later Thursday, Congress unanimously approved $1.1 billion in
emergency aid for victims of Hugo, the largest relief package ever
for a natural disaster. Hugo ``may well be the most damaging one
(hurricane) in history,'' said FEMA spokesman Bill McAda.
   McAda said the aid cannot go to people insured for home or
business losses. The program provides loans up to $10,000 for
people ``who have needs and cannot qualify for (private) loans for
some reason or other.''
   State officials put South Carolina's insured loss at $2.5
billion.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush may sign the
legislation while he is in South Carolina.
   ``I have never seen so much damage in my life,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., told his colleagues before the vote. ``It looked
like there had been a war there. ... We need all the help we can
get.''
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., angrily criticized FEMA for
opening only five assistance offices, where long lines formed,
although 17 counties in the state have been declared federal
disaster areas.
   ``We've got to make sure everything possible has been done at
the Washington level. FEMA is still the bottleneck,'' he said.
   Fitzwater, asked if Bush might help cut red tape that is
hindering the cleanup, said, ``If there is any _ yes. We'll take a
look at that.''
   Republican U.S. Rep. Arthur Ravenel, whose district includes
Charleston, disagreed: ``I detect some partisan politics creeping
into the tragedy and that's a shame.''
   Ravenel said requests for federal aid must come through the
governor's office and ``everything the governor has requested has
been dispatched immediately.''
   In addition to Bush's visit, a congressional delegation led by
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is scheduled to tour
Charleston and Florence on Friday.
   Charleston International Airport, closed since the storm hit,
reopened to limited commercial traffic on Thursday.
   The airport concourses weren't open because of roof damage
suffered in the storm. ``It's not pretty but it works,'' said David
Jennings, chairman of the Charleston County Aviation Authority.
   Hugo, which smashed into South Carolina Sept. 21, has been
blamed for 29 deaths in the United States, 18 of them in South
Carolina. The storm also killed at least 33 people in the Caribbean.
   An estimated 203,000 utility customers in South Carolina
remained without power Thursday, more than half in the Charleston
area. About 50,000 Charleston-area residents had been displaced by
the storm, officials said.
   Even the FEMA headquarters in North Charleston felt the effects
of the electric problems.
   ``The power comes and goes. I think it is like this throughout
the city where there are varying degrees of power,'' said spokesman
Ron Ruffennach.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said approximately 1,600 active
duty Army personnel had been detailed to various duties along the
East Coast to aid in the cleanup. The National Guard committed some
3,925 personnel involved in North and South Carolina, he said, and
the Navy had some 600 construction specialists in the area with 495
Marine Corps personnel.
   Supplies, including 5,000 cases of baby food, four tons of pet
food and one ton of Mississippi catfish continued to pour into the
area. The American Red Cross said it had donated $42 million to aid
victims of Hugo in the Caribbean and in the United States, the
largest relief operation in the organization's history.
   The Interior Department said it sent a team of National Park
Service specialists to Charleston to help deal with restoration of
the hundreds of historic structures damaged or destroyed by Hugo.
   Almost 18,000 miles of roads in the state were damaged or
covered by debris, said Highway Department officials. Highway
Department Executive Director J.G. Rideoutte said it could take 18
months to clean the roads.

<HEAD>Patients Might Benefit From Switch in High Blood Pressure Drugs</HEAD>

   A study showing that certain high blood pressure
drugs may increase the risk of a heart attack suggests that some
patients might be better off with other drugs, doctors say.
   The study reported Thursday found that diuretics, used by 15
million Americans with high blood pressure, may increase the risk
of a heart attack by raising levels of cholesterol and other fatty
substances in the blood and by interfering with the body's use of
insulin and sugar.
   Previous studies had found that while diuretics lower blood
pressure, they do not lower the risk of a heart attack. Attempts to
explain that phenomenon focused on the effect of diuretics on
insulin and blood fats.
   The new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine
by Dr. Thomas Pollare, Dr. Hans Lithell and colleagues at Uppsala
University in Sweden, involved making detailed measurements of
insulin and sugar in 50 patients over three years. It is the first
to provide definitive evidence that the diuretics interfere with
insulin use and increase blood fats, the authors said.
   The study was praised by Dr. James A. Schoenberger, head of the
preventive medicine department at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago and a former president of the American
Heart Association.
   ``I think it's a major study, because it gives us additional
evidence for what many of us have suspected for a long time,'' he
said.
   Schoenberger said patients taking diuretics should not insist
that they be taken off the drugs. ``We don't want panic,'' he said.
But ``everybody ought to ask how their doctors view the data'' in
the study.
   The study was of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide. It is
widely sold in generic form under that name, and it is also
contained in such brand name products as Dyazide, the best-selling
diuretic.
   Dyazide's manufacturer, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals in
Philadelphia, issued a statement emphasizing that Dyazide contains
an additional drug that could ameliorate some of the effects noted
in the study.
   The statement also said long-term studies found that the effects
cited in the new study do not last more than a year.
   The study found that another high blood pressure drug, called
captopril, produced beneficial changes in insulin and sugar use and
had no effect on blood cholesterol and triglycerides.
   Captopril is one of a class of high blood pressure drugs called
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or ACE inhibitors. It is
made by the Squibb Corp. of Princeton, N.J., which held a news
conference Thursday in New York to publicize the study. Squibb's
Swedish affiliate contributed some of the financial support for the
study.
   The two other principal classes of high blood pressure drugs, in
addition to diuretics and ACE inhibitors, are calcium-channel
blockers and beta blockers.
   In studies published in the last few months, Pollare and Lithell
have shown that beta blockers have an even more deleterious effect
than diuretics on insulin, sugar and blood fats. Calcium-channel
blockers had no effect on insulin, sugar or fats, they found.

   House and Senate negotiators struck a bargain
Thursday to delay preliminary work for offshore oil and gas
exploration off the California coast, a compromise between energy
interests and drilling opponents.
   The two sides agreed to a five-month halt next year in many
preliminary activities. In effect, the deal gives drilling foes
five more months to continue their efforts to block production.
   The provision is slated to become part of a compromise $11
billion spending bill for federal land and cultural programs in the
Interior Department and related agencies during the fiscal year
beginning Sunday. Bargainers from the two houses hoped to complete
their work on the bill Friday.
   Negotiators also adopted provisions to forbid lobbyists who help
clients gain federal aid to be paid with federal dollars they
obtain. Those lobbyists would also generally be required to file
public reports on their activities with Congress.
   The Senate also rejected an amendment that would have directed
conferees to stand fast on a ban of financial support for
``obscene'' art. The 62-35 vote early Friday reversed a vote taken
two months ago on the amendment introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.
   Helms introduced the measure in July after being angered that
the National Endowment for the Arts had paid $45,000 for a pair of
exhibitions. One included photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe depicting homoerotic acts and the genitalia of
children, while the other showed a photograph by Andres Serrano of
a crucifix in a jar of urine.
   The House never adopted a ban on so-called obscene art, voting
264-153 against on Sept. 13 and instead voting to cut $45,000 for
the Endowment.
   As has been routine since the early 1980s, the legislation
imposes another one-year moratorium on leasing and drilling in
federal waters off Alaska, much of California, Florida and much of
the Northeast.
   The five-month delay in pre-leasing activities is favored by
drilling opponents, who say it would help postpone drilling if the
moratorium were ever lifted. Those activities include such work as
studies on how the environment would be effected by the work, and
public hearings.
   The House had earlier approved a one-year restrictions on
pre-lease activities, while the Senate had no such provision.
   The issue has been an important one in environmentally conscious
California, even before the March Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska
that aroused additional public concern.
   President Bush has imposed a delay on lease sales off California
until Jan. 1, when a task force he appointed is due to report.
Under the agreement reached Thursday, pre-lease activities _ short
of the release of a preliminary environmental impact study _ could
not proceed until five months after that task force report is ready.
   ``This will allow time for California and for Congress to digest
the report,'' said Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif., who pressed for the
delay.
   The lobbying restrictions, sponsored by Sen Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., were weakened somewhat from their original version.
   Violations would be punishable by fines of from $10,000 to
$100,000, instead of the $100,000 Byrd had sought. And reporting
requirements, which Byrd proposed applying to all lobbyists seeking
federal money, would only apply to those whose contracts exceed
$100,000. In addition, the Defense Department would be allowed to
waive the provisions.
   Negotiators on the Helms amendment remained at odds over whether
standards attempting to describe what constitutes obscene art
should be enacted into law while a commission studies the issue.

   Finance officials from 152 nations are heading
home with progress _ but no final decisions _ on whether to boost
Japan's standing in the International Monetary Fund and while
increasing the fund's resources.
   Michel Camdessus, the former French central bank chief who
serves as managing director of the IMF, is urging that the fund's
resources, called quotas, be doubled from $120 billion to $240
billion.
   The increase is needed, he argued, to meet the agency's growing
responsibilities in the 1990s, including aiding Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady's strategy to reduce the Third World's crushing
debt burden and helping Eastern European nations convert their
economies from state control to free enterprise.
   Also discussed during the three-day annual meeting of the IMF
and its sister organization, the World Bank, were world
environmental problems and efforts by the major industrial nations
to stabilize their currencies' exchange rates.
   Both organizations, headquartered in Washington, were founded
after World War II to promote economic growth and stability.
   On Thursday, after the closing session, Camdessus expressed
confidence that agreement can be reached on a quota increase by the
end of the year.
   Nineteen members of the fund's 22-member executive board support
a quota increase of 67 percent or more, he said. But Saudi Arabia,
Great Britain and the United States, which holds veto power on the
question, have yet to sign on.
   Quotas are supplied from member nations' reserves and can be
withdrawn at any time. An increase would not add to the U.S. budget
deficit.
   President Bush told the organizations, ``The United States
recognizes that the IMF must have adequate resources to fulfill its
critical role'' and pledged to work on reaching a decision by the
end of the year.
   However, Treasury officials say the administration remains
unconvinced that IMF needs as much as its leaders are requesting.
   Complicating the debate are touchy questions of national
prestige for the United States' closest allies. In exchange for
contributing reserves, each nation receives a commensurate share of
voting power in the IMF.
   Japan has expressed a willingness to recycle more of the revenue
from its huge trade surplus through the IMF, but only in exchange
for more influence in the organization.
   It already holds the No. 2 slot in the World Bank and wants to
vault from fifth to second in the fund, behind only the United
States in voting power. That would displace Great Britain, which
despite the efforts of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has fallen
behind Japan as a world economic power.
   Delegates said a compromise is emerging that would permit Japan
and West Germany to share the second slot, while France and Great
Britain would share the fourth position.
   Meanwhile, World Bank President Barber B. Conable, a former
Republican member of Congress from New York, is seeking a
replenishment of the bank's International Development Agency, which
makes low-interest loans to the world's poorest nations.
   The United States is the lone holdout among 34 nations over
providing $14.5 billion for three years worth of loans, in part
because its share of $3.2 billion would add to the budget deficit,
unlike an increase in IMF quotas.
   In other developments at the meetings:
   _Bush and the other Western leaders warmly encouraged Polish
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz's efforts to secure aid in his
country's historic conversion of its economy from communism to
capitalism. However, they withheld promising specific amounts until
Poland agrees to a program of economic reforms with the IMF.
Officials said that could come in as soon as two months.
   _The IMF on Wednesday granted Argentina, Latin America's third
largest debtor, a $1.4 billion stabilization loan in reward for
economic reforms instituted by its new president, Carlos Menem.
   However, moves last week by three large U.S. banks to add to
loan loss reserves for developing country debt raised concern among
delegates that banks would be unwilling to follow the write offs
with enough new lending to keep the borrowing countries growing.
Bush, Camdessus and other officials used the meetings as an
occasion to urge bankers to continue to lend.
   _The Group of Seven _ United States, Japan, West Germany, Great
Britain, France, Canada and Italy _ announced an accord on exchange
rates. The group's central banks, starting Monday, intervened
vigorously in currency markets, driving the dollar's value down.
The effort was aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit and the
German and Japanese trade surpluses.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he is
hopeful Israel and Palestinian Arabs will start negotiations on the
future of the West Bank and Gaza.
   Baker said Israel would bring to the talks a plan by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir for holding elections in the territories.
   The Palestinians, he said, would bring a 10-point election
formula proposed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   But Baker stressed at a news conference Thursday that the Bush
administration supports Shamir's proposal and views Mubarak's as
``simply a means of trying to assist to get the parties to the
table.''
   He said Mubarak's 10 points were not intended as a substitute
for Shamir's plan for elections to choose Palestinians for
negotiations. However, Baker did not explain how the two ideas
could be meshed.
   Shamir has described the Mubarak formula as a prescription for
Israeli surrender.
   It calls on Israel to commit itself to giving up territory and
to dealing in the negotiations with Palestinians deported during
the 22-month uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Baker discussed the two approaches in a three-way meeting with
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister
Esmet Abdel-Meguid.
   Afterward, Baker told reporters they had ``a good discussion''
and ``there may be some potential for progress.''
   But Baker was cautious.
   ``We really will not know'' until key members of the Israeli
Cabinet meet in Jerusalem next Wednesday, Baker said.

   Teacher union leader Albert Shanker
has a thought-provoking way of looking at the monumental chore left
by the historic two-day education summit with President Bush and
the nation's governors.
   ``I think you have to view this like trying to find a cure for a
disease,'' said Shanker, head of the American Federation of
Teachers. ``You don't know exactly'' what may work ``but you know
that if you provide the right resources, give people the right
incentives, you know that over a period of time they will.''
   The nation will see results from the summit in five to 10 years,
he said, warning, ``Anybody who thinks that with 40 million kids
and 2{ million teachers you can turn the system around in one or
two years is foolish.''
   Bush and the governors met for two days at the University of
Virginia to hammer out a process intended to result in the entire
nation _ teachers, parents, school boards, administrators,
businessmen, politicians _ setting national goals on what children
should learn and when, where they should learn it and what type of
people should teach them.
   Bush couldn't have provided a better setting, drawing the state
chief executives to the placid, picturesque Blue Ridge Mountain
area of Thomas Jefferson's school. He courted them royally, wining
and dining them in Jefferson's home, perched on a mountaintop with
a breathtaking view.
   But he declined pleas for more federal money for public schools.
Administration officials indicate that extra help probably will
come once the goals are settled, possibly in the form of loosening
the red tape normally attached with federal school funds.
   Some governors, particularly Democrats, who had earlier said
they wanted more federal money, walked away instead with a list of
goals with no funds attached.
   However, the governors succeeded in pressing Bush for a greater
commitment to one day making the Head Start program available to
more disadvantaged preschoolers _ a stronger statement than he
earlier indicated he was willing to make.
   Lofty goals and education reform ideas are nothing new for the
nation's governors, many of whom already have embarked on ambitious
programs to improve the education system. In 1986, the NGA outlined
a five-year agenda on education, and each year since then the
governors have reported their states' progress.
   ``Certainly this isn't the kind of issue that's going to be
resolved even by something as historic as this education summit
ordered by the president,'' said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste.
   ``For many of us, legitimizing the reform agenda and putting
sort of the White House `Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' on the
reform agenda is a plus.''
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, chairman of the National Governors'
Association, said each governor is expected to work with the NGA's
education task force to develop the goals. A preliminary report,
complete with timetables, should be completed by the NGA's February
meeting, where Bush has been invited to attend, Branstad said.
   As Shanker puts it, ``We need the right step to define the
goals. If you get the wrong goals and the wrong measurements, this
will all turn into a pile of garbage because whatever they decide
are goals everybody (has) got to be doing, so they better be
right.''
   The summit, said Shanker, ``is the major turning point. I think
they discussed the right issues and they came up with the right
answers.''
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
said the governors need to assess the efforts that already are
going on in individual school districts.
   Then, leaders can focus on worthwhile goals and toss out the
trendy solutions.
   Montana Gov. Stan Stephens is convinced some results _ the
intangible ones _ will be evident shortly.
   ``I think you'll see attitudes change. I think you're going to
see cooperation,'' Stephens said. ``In that sense, I think you are
going to see it right away.
   ``But to restructure education and to redefine goals, it's going
to be an ongoing thing. It's going to take a lot to do that because
our educational system in this country, to a great extent has not
changed that much while the world has changed...
   ``Fifteen, 20 years ago we weren't dealing in an international
marketplace. We are today,'' he said. ``We used to compete amongst
ourselves. Now we are competing with the world.''

   Hank Snow was amazed when police told
him they had recovered his son's three-speed bicycle, which was
stolen 10 years ago. His amazement grew when he tried to get it
back.
   In 1979, he bought the bike for his son, Brad, then 14. It soon
was stolen from his yard, and when police didn't locate it
immediately, Snow figured it was gone for good.
   But police called to tell him the bike was found Aug. 31. They
had traced a registration sticker to Snow.
   Police said, however, that it would take 30 days to turn over
the bike. It turned out the bike had been stolen that month from a
16-year-old boy.
   The boy said he bought the bike from someone out of town. A
sheriff's deputy looked for the seller, but couldn't find him.
Authorities then decided to return the bike to the boy.
   ``That made me very unhappy,'' Snow said.
   Police said the boy had ownership rights because he paid $15 for
it, and that if Snow wanted the bike he would have to buy it back.
   ``I didn't think that was right. That's when I contacted the
city law director's office. Our whole family went up _ my wife,
myself and my son _ and we gave written statements about the
bicycle.''
   Law Director William Smith eventually decided that the evidence
made Snow the owner.

   Corvallis met Corvallis, and he liked
what he saw.
   Corvallis Ramey, 54, of Chesterfield County, Va., and his wife,
Gertrude, drove 3,300 miles in their mobile home to visit his
namesake this week.
   Ramey said his father, Vennis, picked his name after spending
hours looking at maps for a name ``he hadn't heard of. And a place
on a map that there weren't two of.''
   Ramey said he and his wife talked about the trip for more than
30 years. He called the city recently for advance information.
   ``Of course, they couldn't believe my name was Corvallis,'' he
said. ``But I said, `I'll be there to prove it.'''
   The Rameys spent Tuesday visiting local landmarks, including
City Hall, the Benton County Courthouse, Central Park and the
Cannery Mall, where they bought T-shirts proclaiming ``Man ... I
love this town, Corvallis, Oregon.''
   City Manager Gerald Seals shook his hand. The Rameys captured
the moment on videotape.
   Told there's a Corvallis, Mont., Ramey just smiled. ``This is
the one I was named after,'' he said. ``That's the only one I care
about.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate, in restoring $600 million to Star
Wars, seeks to strengthen its negotiating position with a
Democratic-controlled House looking to slash funds from President
Bush's missile defense shield.
   ``It's a bargaining strategy for the conference,'' Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., said shortly after the Senate reversed field
Thursday and restored two-thirds of the money it had cut for Star
Wars.
   ``It doesn't represent an increase in support for Star Wars,''
Levin said.
   The dramatic 53-47 vote on the Strategic Defense Initiative,
commonly known as Star Wars, was capped by final passage early
today of the $288 billion military spending bill.
   The vote on the overall bill was 96-2 with Sens. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D., voting against the legislation and
Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., not
voting.
   The spending bill, adopted after four days of debate, includes
the following provisions:
   _Elimination of all $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident
2 missile but an increase of $70 million to Bush's request of $216
million for research and development of the submarine-launched
weapon. The Senate action came more than one month after a Trident
2 missile exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclear
submarine Tennessee.
   _Endorsement of Bush's request of $1.1 billion for the
multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX missile and $100 million for the
single-warhead, Midgetman missile.
   _General approval of the B-2 stealth bomber, the bat-winged
aircraft considered the most expensive in history at $530 million a
copy.
   _Endorsement of a plan to shut down 86 domestic military bases
and scale down five more.
   _Funding of $255 million for research and development on the
Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane the Bush
administration sought to cancel.
   House and Senate members will meet in conference next week to
thrash out a final version of the appropriations bill.
   On Star Wars, the Senate approved a total of $4.3 billion and
gave members of the Senate Armed Services Committee more room to
maneuver in talks with the House.
   The Senate, in approving its authorization bill last month,
approved $4.5 billion for Star Wars; the House adopted a funding
level of $3.1 billion.
   Lack of progress on a final version gave way to confident House
members indicating Thursday morning that they would not accept a
Star Wars funding level higher than $3.5 billion. Their argument:
The Senate vote Tuesday night in which the chamber slashed $900
million from the missile defense shield.
   ``It shot a hole in the poor Senate position. Take that, Sam
Nunn,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House
Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday.
   But Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed
Services Committee, would not stand for having his bargaining
position undercut. He easily gained the support of the key
Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and Sen. John Warner
of Virginia, ranking GOP member on the Armed Services Committee,
and took his case to the Senate.
   ``I am not a cheerleader for SDI. I always voted to cut some of
the program,'' Nunn told his colleagues. ``But I also felt it was a
valuable research program.''
   ``We're not going to negotiate between $3.7 billion and $2.8
billion. Where does that leave us?'' Nunn said. ``Maybe we'll sit
here until Thanksgiving. Maybe we'll do that. ... I'm convinced the
only way to do it is to send a signal to the House conferees.''
   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., questioned whether senators
really believe the House is ``weak-willed and weak-minded'' and
wouldn't know ``what's going on here.''
   However, the amendment prevailed and the Senate negotiators on
the authorization bill laid claim to what they believe is a
stronger hand in the conference.
   ``Once we determined the conference depended on it (Star Wars),
the strength developed,'' Warner said. ``It's cyclical. We're
concluding this day on a high note.''
   But there was a note of dissent from some lawmakers.
   ``Part of the bargaining strategy was a close Senate vote for
improving our bargaining position. Whether it succeeds remains to
be seen,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a member of the Armed
Services Committee and SDI supporter who noted that congressmen
won't be ``fooled over there.''

   Conservative civil rights activists agree with
one of the National Urban League's criticisms of President Bush's
civil rights record: he's said the right things, so far, but hasn't
done much.
   ``Here we are almost a year into it and it's not very clear what
direction they are going to take,'' Clint Bolick, director of the
Landmark Legal Foundation Center for Civil Rights, said Thursday.
   ``What I have not seen in the area of empowerment (of
minorities) is much beyond rhetoric,'' he added. ``There seems to
be a duality of purpose. I have seen the right rhetoric, some
inconsistent actions, and not enough action,''
   Daniel L. Casey, executive director of the American Conservative
Union, agreed: ``I am not exactly sure if I can tell you exactly
where they stand on civil rights. I call it schizophrenia,'' he
said.
   The remarks were similar to what Urban League officials said
after Bush told the league's annual conference Aug. 8 that his
administration is ``committed to reaching out to minorities, to
striking down barriers to free and open access.''
   John Jacob, the president of the league, said after the
president's speech, ``He is saying the right things. Now we have to
find out whether he is willing to do the right things.''
   And Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, commented, ``We have heard Mr. Bush say the
right words; now he must turn on the music and dance.''
   Despite the comments, the conservatives and the orthodox civil
rights leaders have sharply differing agendas.
   The Urban League members back traditional affirmative action
programs, are dismayed by recent Supreme Court decisions eroding
the programs and are backing legislation to overturn those
decisions.
   The conservatives oppose the affirmative action programs as
reverse discrimination, are delighted by the high court's rulings
and are gearing up to fight the remedial legislation proposed in
Congress.
   ``I think that I am talking about something very different than
John Jacob and his folks are talking about,'' said Bolick.
   ``When Bush went to the Urban League he gave a very different
message than they were used to hearing,'' he said. ``So far, the
rhetoric is solidly on our side of the equation. I don't know
whether those subtle nuances are not being grasped by the other
side or whether I am being naive about exactly what they are
saying.''
   In any event, he said, the administration should more
aggressively defend the Supreme Court's recent decisions.
   In its last session, the court struck down a 30 percent minority
set-aside requirement for government contracts in Richmond, Va.,
stiffened the requirements for statistical proof in job
discrimination cases and held that settlements in such cases can be
challenged later by employees who were not a party to it.
   Bills have been introduced to reverse some of the effects of
those decisions.
   ``The day these bills were introduced, the Bush administration
should have introduced legislation dealing with some of the issues
or at least establishing a commission to recommend such
legislation,'' Bolick said. ``Thus far the administration is
fighting a purely defensive battle, which is exactly the trap the
Reagan administration fell into.''
   Casey added, ``We see the president affirming the recent Supreme
Court decisions _ at least to the extent that he does not favor
remedial legislation _ and at the same time the Justice Department
is filing a brief in support of a racial set-aside program.''
   ``This sort of attempt to square the circle only inspires the
president's enemies and cools the ardor of his supporters,'' the
Conservative Union leader said.
   Bolick said the administration should push for ``a refocusing of
affirmative action away from quotas and toward investment in human
capital development,'' more black entrepreneurial opportunity, free
choice for parents among schools, getting people off welfare, and
promoting ``freedom from crime.''

<HEAD>Top U.S. Envoy Tells Opposition Leader U.S. To Maintain Sanctions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads thruout to CORRECT that Endara not jailed; Minor editing;
No Pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIA VICTORIA GONZALEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top U.S. diplomat in Panama told
an opposition leader that Washington has no immediate plans to lift
economic sanctions aimed at forcing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
from power.
   Charge d'affaires John Maisto said the sanctions imposed last
year after Noriega was indicted in Florida on drug trafficking
charges are having their effect and ``will continue.''
   Maisto Thursday met with opposition leader Guillermo Endara, who
is on the ninth day of a hunger-strike. Endara hopes to persuade
Panamanians to stop playing the lottery, gambling in casinos or
going to the racetrack and thus deprive the government of needed
revenue.
   ``I came to greet (Endara) and offer support for democracy here,
in Panama,'' Maisto said. He called Noriega ``a dictator who uses
force, and who will continue using force, like all dictators, until
the day they leave.''
   Michael Polt, a U.S. political officer, accompanied Maisto.
Ambassador Arthur Davis left the country in May to show displeasure
at Noriega's refusal to step down.
   Among the U.S. sanctions, Washington froze Panamanian government
assets in the United States and barred American companies from
paying Panamanian taxes. Canal revenues owed to Panama were also
frozen.
   Last week Washington announced it was putting 14 Panamanian
companies and individuals on a trade blacklist. U.S. companies were
prohibited from dealing with the 14.
   Noriega, who controls the government as chief of the Panamanian
Defense Forces, has denied the drug trafficking and money
laundering charges.
   Endara was the opposition coalition candidate in May 7
elections, which were annulled by the government when it became
obvious the opposition was winning by a landslide. Endara's running
mates were Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford.
   Noriega's longtime friend Francisco Rodriguez was named
provisional president on Sept. 1, when former President Manuel
Solis Palma's term expired.
   ``The United States recognizes the triumvirate here _ Endara,
Arias Calderon and Ford _ as the winners of the May 7 elections.
Not only the United States, but also all the civilized countries of
the world recognize this,'' Maisto said.
   Asked to comment on threats that Endara may be arrested, Maisto
replied: ``If this de facto regime does this, it would be very
unfortunate, very unfortunate, and all of us and all the countries
of good will hope this does not occur.''
   Earlier Thursday, Attorney General Carlos Villalaz warned that
``anyone urging civil disobedience will be investigated.''
   Seven people were arrested Wednesday in raids on a printshop and
an advertising agency that worked for the opposition, Villalaz
said. They were accused of plotting to undermine the national
economy, he said.
   Asked if he would interrogate opposition leaders leading the
anti-Noriega campaign, Villalaz replied, ``We will do so, as the
course of the investigation warrants it.''

<HEAD>Luken Says Bush Won't Provide Funds for Disabled Rights</HEAD>

   The partisan dispute over funding for Amtrak
is putting a crack in the consensus for major legislation to
guarantee the rights of the disabled.
   The dispute arose Thursday in a hearing of a House Energy and
Commerce transportation subcommittee studying the impact of the
proposed Americans With Disabilities Act on Amtrak.
   The legislation, endorsed by the Bush administration and already
passed this month by the Senate, includes provisions guaranteeing
the disabled access to rail transportation.
   Amtrak would have to spend millions of dollars to comply with
the act. The Bush administration, however, wants to end federal
subsidies for Amtrak.
   ``We can't agree to make Amtrak accessible (to the disabled) if
there's no Amtrak,'' subcommittee Chairman Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio,
told Philip Calkins of the President's Committee on Employment of
People with Disabilities.
   Calkins had told the subcommittee that the cost of adding
accessibility is secondary to assuring the civil rights of the
country's 43 million disabled.
   ``You are lecturing us about money, which we would want to
provide, but the administration says it will veto the money if we
provide the money,'' Luken said. He said the House will probably
pass the bill ``along the lines of saying how do to it and then not
pay for it.''
   The House and Senate have passed separate bills giving Amtrak
$615 million for fiscal 1990, with $85 million for capital
improvements. The administration wants to eliminate subsidies for
Amtrak, saying it serves less than one-half of 1 percent of all
intercity travel.
   Amtrak chief W. Graham Claytor Jr. told the subcommittee it will
cost $52 million over 20 years to modify stations under the act.
   That includes costs to meet access requirements mandated by the
overlapping Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Amtrak says that low
subsidies during the Reagan administration have hindered its
ability to meet those requirements.

<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 13th graf to replace `seventeen' with `sixteen.'</HEAD>

   The federal government is losing ground in its
program to clean up the nation's most dangerous hazardous waste
dumps.
   In eight years cleanup work has been completed on only about
three dozen sites, and on Thursday the Environmental Protection
Agency added 93 new properties in 32 states that need to be cleared
of hazardous waste and debris.
   The additional sites bring to 1,194 the waste dumps scheduled to
be decontaminated under the Superfund program, which is aimed at
dealing with the nation's most hazardous waste problems. EPA
officials have said the program likely will cost tens of billions
of dollars and take decades.
   The national priority list for cleanup projects would have grown
even more, except for a decision by the EPA to also delete 31 sites
that had been on the list.
   Of the 31 sites, 27 are to be shifted to another cleanup program
within the agency. Cleanup activities were to continue at those 27
sites, but not under the Superfund program, said EPA spokeswoman
Mary Mears.
   The other four sites were deleted because the health risks
associated with them no longer were considered sufficient to meet
the Superfund criteria, said Ms. Mears.
   The national priority list represents the worst of an estimated
30,000 hazardous waste dumps in need of treatment nationwide.
   Since 1980, Congress has appropriated more than $8 billion for
removal of toxic and radioactive materials from contaminated sites
under the Superfund program.
   Earlier this month, a study by the Rand Corp. concluded that the
Superfund program has been ``superslow'' in dealing with the toxic
waste dump problem and that the EPA has not been aggressive enough
in getting polluters to pay for the cleanup.
   During the program's first eight years, cleanup was finished at
only 34 of the 1,175 sites on the priority list at the time of the
study, the Rand Corp. analysis said. The report also criticized the
agency for not spending more of the money provided by Congress for
cleanup.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly has acknowledged that work has
been completed at only a small number of Superfund sites, but
maintains the number does not reflect the overall progress that has
been made in the program.
   At many sites, substantial work has been completed and in many
cases the most severe health threats have been mitigated or even
eliminated, although work technically has not been finished, EPA
officials maintain.
   The additional target locations for cleanup announced Thursday
were spread over 32 states and Puerto Rico. Sixteen of the
additional sites were in Pennsylvania, nine in California and seven
in Washington state.
   Among the new sites were 11 federal facilities including the
Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in Colorado and four nuclear
weapons plants near Hanford, Wash.
   These facilities joined 52 other military installations, nuclear
fuel processing plants and other federal facilities already on the
EPA priority cleanup list.
   Reilly recently announced plans to put greater emphasis on
getting polluters to pay for cleanup projects through civil suits
and a threat of penalties.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Superfund
subcommittee and a frequent critic of the EPA's handling of the
cleanup program, said the announcement that additional sites had
been put on the priority list ``marks an important step forward in
getting these sites cleaned up.''
   Overall, he added, the program continues to have problems.

   Coastal property owners in this
hurricane-scarred state are being told a tough new conservation law
won't necessarily keep them from rebuilding on the water's edge.
   ``We don't want people to panic,'' said H. Wayne Beam, executive
director of the South Carolina Coastal Council. ``People are
calling us, asking if all of Myrtle Beach will be affected by the
law and it will not be.''
   The 18-member council administers the controversial Beachfront
Management Act, passed last year in response to an accelerating
erosion problem blamed on overdevelopment of the state's coastline.
   The law, which took effect in July 1988, bans new construction
within a so-called ``dead zone'' extending inland 20 feet from an
established dune line, and prohibits the rebuilding of any home or
hotel in the zone that suffers more than two-thirds damage.
   The controversial law was already under challenge before
Hurricane Hugo hit last week. Homeowners on Hilton Head Island had
filed suit in federal court and the state Senate passed a revision
giving the council more latitude to permit rebuilding within the
dead zone. The House has not given its approval.
   Hugo cut a swath of destruction along more than half of the
state's 187-mile coastline last week, and hundreds of coastal
property owners are worried they won't be able to rebuild.
   The council met Thursday to streamline recovery efforts. Owners
of damaged buildings, seawalls and docks will receive a
construction permit without having to file for individual
permission. Those who must rebuild will have to apply for special
permission.
   The council also agreed to permit hotels to rebuild oceanfront
swimming pools damaged or destroyed by the storm and reallocated
$10 million distributed before Hugo to refurbish the state's
beaches; Hilton Head Island officials returned $6.25 million
allocated to them before the storm, which left their beaches
largely unscathed.
   State tourist industry offficials were urging quick action to
get beach resort areas back in shape for next year's season.
   ``We represent a large part of the state's Golden Goose,'' said
Myrtle Beach Mayor Bob Grissom. ``We need to get to business
yesterday.''
   While there are no estimates available on the number of beach
properties destroyed by Hugo, a survey taken before the storm found
that only 200 owners did not have enough property to rebuild their
structures by moving them several feet inland.
   The other 700 structures in the survey were on lots big enough
for the owners to move them outside the ``dead zone.''
   Beam also said the two-thirds damage clause will be liberally
interpreted.
   ``There will be some losses, but a house will have to be in bad
shape to be considered two-thirds destroyed,'' he said. ``I believe
there will be many buildings that may be condemned by local
standards that will not be considered beyond repair by us.''
   Under the council's regulations, even homes lifted off
foundations or pilings can be replaced at their original site.

<HEAD>Measure Would Require Canisters in Autos to Trap Gasoline Vapors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's clean air bill now includes a
requirement for vapor-trapping canisters in cars despite a
lawmaker's warning that the devices may be ``motorized bombs.''
   The House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee added the
provision Thursday in a unanimous voice vote that included the
consent of Rep. John D. Dingell _ the lawmaker who expressed the
safety concern. Amendment supporters said the canisters could be
made safe.
   Dingell, D-Mich., agreed only after the panel voted to require
consultation by federal officials to ensure the devices are safe
before they're installed to trap gasoline fumes.
   The requirement, an effort to reduce cancer risk, would take
effect four years after the bill became law and would apply only to
cars sold in the most polluted cities. Gasoline vapors have been
classified as a probable carcinogen by EPA, causing an estimated 25
to 75 cancer cases annually.
   Meanwhile, subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.
negotiated privately with lawmakers to win support for his proposal
to toughen Bush's standards for auto tailpipe emissions. The
negotiators were deadlocked over Waxman's demand for a second phase
of emissions reductions early in the next century.
   Waxman offered the canister amendment, arguing that ``we have
never heard any reputable source actually indicate that on-board
canisters present a real safety risk.''
   He said the government's National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration and the Center for Auto Safety, founded by Ralph
Nader, have concluded the technology exists to make the devices
safe.
   The on-board charcoal canisters have long been sought by
environmental groups and the Environmental Protection Agency staff
_ but were rejected by top Bush administration officials who write
the clean air bill.
   Some states and cities _ among them California and New York,
Washington, D.C., and St. Louis _ already have approved another
method of capturing the gasoline vapors: special boots on gasoline
pumps that include hoses to recycle fumes back to the underground
storage tank.
   Auto industry officials have said the canisters could catch fire
after an accident, although there is no hard evidence from test
vehicles of that happening.
   Dingell warned that the canisters could force motorists ``to
ride around in motorized bombs.''
   ``If you want to ride around in exploding vehicles, you can
support this amendment with enthusiasm,'' Dingell said as the panel
neared the end of its second week of amending the Bush legislation.
   But Waxman argued the canisters would reduce emissions more than
controls at the gas pump, adding the pump controls cost seven times
as much.
   Multi-National Business Services Inc., which studied the
canister issue for the domestic and imported auto industries, said
the devices would cost an average of $83 per car initially and $37
per car later _ although amounts would vary with each model. But
Waxman and the EPA estimated the average cost at about $14 per car.
   The firm concluded that capturing the vapors at the pump would
be more effective, because it would take 16 years to implement the
canister program. The figure was based on lead time necessary for
automakers plus the time needed for older cars to go out of service.
   White House officials decided to use the gasoline pump controls
in its clean air bill and top EPA officials went along, despite the
staff recommendation.
   ``This is an administration decision,'' said William Rosenberg,
EPA assistant administrator for air programs. ``I have no problem
with these kinds of tradeoffs.''
   EPA officials said the auto industry has favored the gas pump
controls, which would place the expense on the oil companies and
service stations. The oil industry has backed the canisters so that
carmakers would bear the expense.
   The amendment would give the EPA administrator a year after the
bill's enactment to set standards for light-duty motor vehicles,
which could include cars as well as pickup trucks. The canisters
would take effect three years after the rules were approved.
   The systems would have to capture 95 percent of the vapors, and
the EPA administrator could waive the requirement once the
canisters were in widespread use.

<HEAD>Pentagon Official Says DoD `Launders' Contracts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's chief watchdog is investigating
the diversion of hundreds of millions of dollars to other agencies
to award defense contracts without competitive bidding.
   The arrangement, described as a ``money-laundering operation''
by the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, was
detailed Thursday in testimony by the Defense Department's
inspector general.
   ``It's not outside of the law. However, it's a procedure that
has been undertaken to avoid some of the constraints and the
regulations that surround the contracting process,'' said June
Gibbs Brown, the Pentagon's inspector general.
   ``It has escalated astronomically since it started,'' she told
the Senate panel.
   The Pentagon cycled $200 million through the Energy Department's
research laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn., for contractors to perform
management consulting for the Defense Department, the panel was
told.
   The Pentagon transferred another $84 million to a Library of
Congress program, where contractors hired subcontractors for the
same purpose.
   The inspector general is investigating similar deals involving
other federal research centers, operated by private contractors for
the Energy Department, said Derek J. Vander Shaaf, the Pentagon's
deputy inspector general.
   ``The system is being abused to avoid the Competition in
Contracting Act,'' he said.
   The Pentagon used the Library of Congress' Federal Library and
Information Network, known as Fedlink, to award the contracts,
under provisions of the Economy in Government Act.
   The law, intended to avoid costly duplication in procurement,
allows one agency to ask another to procure items it needs.
   Fedlink allows other federal libraries to use the vast resources
of the Library of Congress and centralizes procurement for these
facilities.
   ``Then somebody got the bright idea to try to finance the
operation of the library by passing this money through the
system,'' Vander Schaaf said. ``The library, of course, kept its 15
percent management fee'' from any money returned to the Pentagon.
   Private contractors for the Fedlink subcontracted the work for
the Pentagon for a fee, he said.
   ``It gives those individuals in government that have friends or
have firms that they know, or have other relationships, it gives
them an opportunity to direct a contract to a particular individual
or a firm,'' Vander Schaaf said.
   But Vander Schaaf said the investigation so far had not
documented any examples of officials personally benefiting from
these arrangements.
   In the case of the Energy Department, Martin Marietta Corp.,
which operates the Oak Ridge lab, arranged for subcontracts with
Pentagon money transferred to the Energy Department, he said.
   ``It could also be used as a laundering operation to avoid
end-of-the-year fiscal restraints,'' Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the
panel's chairman said.
   Vander Schaaf replied that about 40 percent of the money sent
through Oak Ridge was spent at the end of the fiscal year so the
Pentagon could avoid losing the money.
   The committee also heard testimony about contract abuse at other
agencies.
   NASA's inspector general, Bill D. Colvin, reported that 81
percent of subcontracts were awarded without competitive bidding.
   Colvin said 33 percent of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration subcontracts he audited were overpriced and 12
percent had yielded profits exceeding 100 percent.
   He said 80 percent of contract abuse he found involved criminal
fraud. There were 300 cases of fraud under active investigation,
plus another 300 awaiting his staff's attention, Colvin said.
   John C. Layton, inspector general for the Energy Department,
said private contractors were reimbursed for expenses even when the
agency found instances of fraud and abuse.

<TEXT>
   NASA should put off development of a new space
shuttle rocket and instead try to perfect the rocket now being used
for the accelerated space shuttle program, says the head of a NASA
safety advisory board.
   Joe Sutter, chairman of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel,
told a House subcommittee Thursday that NASA can't have it both
ways by stepping up shuttle launches with rocket boosters that
officials want to be replaced.
   ``It makes me quite nervous,'' to use old rockets in an
intensified program if NASA lacks confidence in them, Sutter said.
Either the rockets can be used ``or they'd better not fly.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been
rebuilding the shuttle program that ground to a halt after the 1986
Challenger disaster. The agency hopes to have as many as 14 annual
launches by 1994.
   The latest shuttles launched are using a redesigned solid rocket
motor to propel the booster, which launches the orbiter into space.
The design changes were made to correct flaws responsible for the
Challenger explosion, which was blamed on problems with the rocket
joints.
   But NASA is also committed to developing a so-called advanced
solid rocket motor, and over the objections of the safety panel
contracted to develop 44 of them at a cost of $1.1 billion. The
first ones are to be delivered in 1994.
   The new design emphasizes welds over bolts, allows for
mechanical closing of joints and has different seals that permit
more visual inspection, NASA says. Construction of the new rocket
would be more automated, NASA says, leaving less room for human
error.
   ``It is still the number one priority with me,'' said J.R.
Thompson, NASA deputy administrator. ``It is the last system that
failed. (When it fails) it always fails catastrophically.''
   Sutter, speaking to the House Science, Space and Technology
science subcommittee, said that NASA needs to have a tried and true
shuttle rocket ready for the space station program in 1995 because
that new program will rely on the shuttle for construction, supply
and operation.
   Sutter said that although the advanced rocket motor may be
``inherently safer,'' it may not be ``realistically safer'' in
1995. By then, he said, the current rocket motor will have had 50
to 75 successful flights.

   The handful of black Americans
living in South Africa experience apartheid uniquely. They feel the
personal insult of race discrimination, but they cannot share black
South Africans' sense of oppression.
   ``The little things I've been through are nothing compared to
growing up in a place like this and being told you're inferior,''
said Becky Ginsburg of Los Angeles. She has worked with church
groups in South Africa for two years.
   ``Personal discrimination against me is the least of it. More
painful is how South Africans are being outraged,'' Ms. Ginsburg
said.
   Vernon Grigg, a Yale Law School student who is the first black
to clerk for a Johannesburg Supreme Court judge, described his
initial view of South Africa: ``As the plane rolled up, truckloads
of black men in uniforms were being driven up to clean the plane.''
   Grigg arrived on Sept. 6, election day, when millions of blacks
stayed home to protest their exclusion from the voting. A week
later, he joined 15,000 people in an anti-apartheid march through
Johannesburg.
   ``I realized for the first time of my life, I'm a part of the
majority _ just by the fact that I'm black. It's an empowering
feeling,'' said Grigg.
   Dee Nealy, 30, who came from Boston with her family to set up a
Church of Christ ministry in the black township of Soweto, feels
differently.
   ``Even though blacks are a majority, I feel like a minority,''
she said. ``It's just because of the way people are classified.
Blacks are looked down on.''
   Charles Baquet, 47, the black U.S. consul-general in Cape Town,
said in the year he has been in South Africa he was surprised
ordinary whites worked to alleviate the effects of apartheid.
   And he said he gets angry every time he visits black townships.
   ``Neither Soweto (outside Johannesburg) nor Crossroads (a
shantytown near Cape Town) are anything like Harlem,'' he said.
``These `ghettos' were contrived with forethought. Someone here
thought about the worst living conditions you could put black
people in, and created them.''
   Mrs. Nealy, 30, says South Africa is similar to the United
States 25 years ago, and she worries about street crime. But she
and her husband have applied for permanent residence.
   As soon as their accents reveal their nationality, black
Americans may be treated as oddities or celebrities.
   Grigg, 26, who is working in South Africa's second-highest court
under a research grant from a U.S. human rights institute, says the
attention he received as one of only three blacks on the aircraft
flying to South Africa was annoying.
   Miss Ginsburg, who grew up in Thunder Bay, Ont., and Ann Arbor,
Mich., had wanted to visit South Africa since she was 13.
   ``I knew I had to come and live here and experience it as a
black person, not just as an observer,'' said the University of
Michigan and Loyola-Marymount graduate.
   But Miss Ginsburg, 26, is treated as ``Colored,'' a person of
mixed-race, because of her light complexion. ``That to me is most
painful, the divide between black and Colored,'' she said.
   Storekeepers wait on her before South African blacks,
``Coloreds'' tell her they are not black, and black people react
warily when she greets them on the street.
   Mrs. Nealy went to a segregated school in Lamarque, Texas, and
her children, 9 and 13, attend a private multiracial school. She
said she has difficulty dealing with South African racism.
   ``I've had to pray about it a lot. ... color is a big issue
here,'' she said. ``I guess the freedom to feel at ease, to go
different places, I miss that. There's racism in the States as
well, but it's very subtle.''
   At the same time black South Africans ``seem a bit standoffish
at first'' and ``don't seem to take it too well'' that she and her
husband, Charles, cannot speak an African language, she said.
   Mrs. Nealy and Grigg say they feel tension, although life seems
normal, and they are amazed at the lack of communication and
interaction between the races.
   Everyone interviewed said they had expected more violence in
South Africa.
   ``People in the U.S. think that as the sun sets there are
running racial battles in the streets, that most whites are
unfeeling...,'' said Baquet, from New Orleans, La.
   ``But I'm working with basically white middle-class groups on a
project in the tough part of Cape Town trying to open a day care
center and rehabilitation center for black children with
disabilities,'' he said.
   Miss Ginsburg, who works for Koinonia, a church organization
that runs programs in which blacks teach whites about social,
economic and political issues, said, ``The fact that everything is
so well-controlled shows that the state of emergency is so
effective.''
   Grigg, also a University of Michigan graduate, from Tucson,
Ariz., said he was startled by the lack of knowledge most white
people have of black life in South Africa.
   He found being mistaken for a South African black and not
understanding local languages can have its advantages.
   While visiting a small town, he and a friend stopped at a store
for directions and cold drinks, and Grigg leaned on the counter.
Grigg said the white owner, trying to tell him he was lazy, had to
repeat the insult in three languages until Grigg understood.
   But the feelings cannot always be laughed off, he said.
   ``It's like an assault on your senses on a daily basis, an
assault on your sense of justice, on your sense of humanity,'' said
Grigg. ``It's not just the big things, when someone says something
to you. Sometimes it's just the look in a child's face.''

   Caught between the burgeoning cost of
state-mandated social programs and the legacy of the Proposition 13
tax revolt, some officials in rural Butte County think bankruptcy
may be their only answer.
   Budget cuts have forced the county to release inmates from
overcrowded jails, curtail office hours and cut the sheriff's
department in half despite a four-fold increase in the county's
population.
   Understaffed libraries may have to close soon, but officials
have made room in the budget for one new expense _ hiring a team of
bankruptcy lawyers.
   ``We've cut and bled every year and literally dismantled our
government until we got to this point,'' says Supervisor Karen
Vercruse.
   ``At some point, the whole thing starts to melt down,'' county
administrator Will Randolph said. ``We're there. We're down to that
point.''
   Many of the state's other 57 counties read their future in the
problems of Butte County, an area 150 miles northeast of Sacramento
rich in gold mining lore, forests and fertile farmland but also
home to widespread poverty.
   ``The danger is that Butte County is the precursor of all the
other counties,'' said Dan Wall, lobbyist for the County
Supervisors Association of California. ``We think it's a real
danger, a real possibility.''
   Counties complain that the state continually shorts them on
funding to pay for welfare, health, court and other services they
are required to provide, while inflation erodes property tax rates
that were frozen by the Proposition 13 taxpayer revolt of 1978.
   Facing a $3 million deficit on its $128 million budget, Butte
County got short-term relief Sept. 18 when Gov. George Deukmejian
agreed to defer a $2.8 million billing for fire services.
   In exchange for the deferment, the county consented to a state
audit.
   But without a long-term solution _ reforms in the funding of
California's counties, a state takeover of some county duties, or
both _ Butte County officials say they'll have to pay back the
state and only be worse off.
   Deukmejian has attacked local governments for blaming their
budget cuts on the state. Some officials predict the results of the
audit will force the state to acknowledge that counties have been
chronically underfunded.
   ``It can't be written off to something such as mismanagement or
somebody's not doing their job,'' says Pat Chartrand, consultant to
state Sen. Jim Nielsen, who represents Butte County.
   The counties face ``more and more obligations and not renough
revenue,'' Chartrand said.
   County officials were considering bankruptcy before the fire
bill deferment; their decision on whether to declare bankruptcy in
the future may hinge on any action the state takes in response to
the audit, as well as to possible action by the legislature when it
returns from recess in January, officials said.
   Oroville, at the foot of the Sierra Nevada in the northern
Sacramento Valley, was settled by miners in the 1849 Gold Rush and
is named after the Spanish word for gold.
   But it is the lure of cheaper housing that is drawing a new wave
of low-income immigrants from cities to Butte County and other
unincorporated areas, swelling welfare rolls and the demand for
other services.
   Butte County, whose 23 percent property tax rate is the state's
second lowest after Orange County, has been particularly hurt by
Proposition 13.
   Since the initiative's passage, Randolph said, the county's
revenues have grown just 26 percent, while inflation has risen 48
percent and costs of mandated programs jumped 261 percent.
   Meanwhile, the county's population of 40,000 has grown to
170,000 and county costs for general assistance welfare grants
increased from $100,000 a year in 1981-82 to $2.4 million this
year, he said.
   The sheriff's department staff has been reduced from 50 patrol
officers to 24. With round-the-clock shifts, there are nights where
there are only two deputies to patrol the entire county, roughly
2,000 square miles, Randolph said.
   Jailers must release inmates weekly to meet a court order
governing the population of the county's overcrowded jail; five
library branches will close Sept. 30 unless volunteers agree to run
them, Randolph said.
   Len Fulton, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, said he
reached the conclusion in 1985 that his county was dying.
   ``I've often said, if we were a corporation here, we probably
would have filed for Chapter 11 moments after I got on this board,
which was 7{ years ago.''

<HEAD>Senator Calls House Mailing Vote `Flagrant Hypocrisy'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a Senate-passed measure to end
free mass mailings for lawmakers says the House is taking a
``deceitful path'' by voting to save the constituent newsletters.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Thursday he hopes the Senate
will not follow the House and reverse a prior vote to virtually
eliminate the favorite perk of incumbents.
   The House, reversing a decision it made three days before, voted
274-137 on Thursday for a conference report that would save the
mass mailings. The compromise also would cut the frequency of
mailings in half _ six to three annually.
   The House had voted 245-137 Monday to instruct its members of
the House-Senate conference committee to back Wilson's plan to
virtually eliminate mass mailings and give the estimated $45
million savings to the war on drugs.
   The conferees, two hours after the House vote, ignored both that
instruction and the 83-8 Senate vote Sept. 7 for Wilson's anti-mail
language.
   The Senate still must approve the compromise and Wilson, heaping
scorn on the House, urged colleagues not to buckle under.
   He complained that House members ``in one breath openly voted to
ban newsletters, but then with flagrant hypocrisy voted to accept a
meaningless compromise that will allow the continued gross abuse''
of the free mail to their constituents.
   ``I hope and trust the Senate will not follow the same deceitful
path of the House,'' he added.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., author of the compromise, said
negotiators knew members wanted to save the newsletters and
privately thanked him for doing so. He said the grateful House
members included 14 Republicans who had voted to stop the mailings
on Monday.
   Several House members warned that if the Senate doesn't accept
the compromise, they would introduce legislation to stop senators
from using campaign contributions for office expenses. The House is
prohibited by its rules from such use of campaign funds.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., urged members before the vote to end
what he called an act of hypocrisy in the House.
   ``If you belong here, you would have guts enough to vote today
... publicly the way you talk privately when the vote machine is
turned off,'' Obey said. ``If you can't do that you ought to go
home and stay home.''
   The mailing was part of the appropriations bill that would run
congressional operations for fiscal 1990 at a cost of $1.9 billion.
   Of that figure, $31.7 million would pay for mailings the
remainder of this year.
   Starting Jan. 1, when the reduced mailings would take effect,
the legislation would spend $54.5 million for House mailings _ 65
percent of the total _ and $29.3 million for Senate mailings. The
House mailings would be reduced 32 percent and the Senate's 14
percent from original estimates.

   The splinters of what used to be a
mahogany altar lay under a gaping hole in the ceiling of the
Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul, a Roman revival structure built
in 1815 and slammed by Hurricane Hugo.
   A big chunk of the roof on the peach-colored church had been
peeled away, exposing naked rafters and sending stone supports
crashing down on the altar.
   ``It's just been crushed. You couldn't do anything but cry,''
said the Very Rev. Nelson Koscheski, the Episcopal church's dean.
   The cathedral, adorned with white columns and archways, was one
of 20 to 30 historic buildings in Charleston destroyed or severely
damaged by Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph fury on Sept. 21, officials
said.
   With damage to about 75 percent of the 3,500 buildings
considered to be of historical significance, Charleston officials
have sent out an SOS to craftsmen around the country, requesting
their help in healing a wounded city.
   ``Other than the loss of life, the real tragedy from Hugo is the
architectural loss,'' said Randolph Martz, an architectural
historian.
   Lawrence Walker, executive director of the Historic Charleston
Foundation, estimated the toll will be in the hundreds of millions
of dollars, and that it would take five years to undo the havoc
caused by Hugo's winds or the rains that fell two days after the
storm.
   ``This city is a national treasure that's been badly hurt. These
buildings are the whole flavor of the city. We are wounded,''
Walker said, ``but we are not dead.''
   Some of the structures in this 319-year-old port city date back
to the 1690s. The pastel mansions, churches and offices also date
from the Federal, Antebellum and Post-Civil War periods.
   Tourists flock to admire terra-cotta ornaments, delicate iron
lacework, cornice details and balustrade railings along with the
intricate plasterwork and ornate furnishings inside.
   One week after Hugo struck a bulls-eye on Charleston, crews
toiled to cover holes with tarp and plastic or secure loose brick.
   ``These buildings are like works of art. What the storm did
would be the same thing as slashing a painting for crushing a
statue,'' Martz said.
   The city has set up a hotline for suppliers and contractors, and
it received 122 calls in a 24-hour period ending Thursday. Artisans
from Massachusetts and Illinois have arrived, as have
preservationists from the American Institute of Architects, the
National Park Service and historical societies in Virginia,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Georgia and North Carolina.
   The city is in dire need of slate for roofs, artisans who can
work with mortar originally mixed with horse hair or ashes, and
plasterers capable of working intricate patterns.
   ``Our biggest problem is being able to secure the right
craftsmen,'' said Connie Wyrick, spokeswoman for the Historic
Charleston Foundation.
   She also urged residents not to settle too quickly with
insurance companies who might want to put an asphalt roof instead
of a slate one on a damaged building. The city has a strict
preservation law that dictates even the pastel colors a house may
be painted.
   ``We've got an outdoor museum here. This isn't tract housing in
Kansas,'' Wyrick said. ``Preservation is part of the mindset of
this city.''
   The historic heart of the city sits on a peninsula like a tongue
of land sticking out into Charleston Harbor. Over 100 of its
buildings have survived British occupation during the Revolutionary
War, the Union bombardment in the Civil War, earthquakes in 1886
and 1893, fires, tornadoes and now a killer hurricane.
   ``Hugo was like a malicious vandal,'' said Charles Chase, the
city architect and preservation officer whose 1895 Victorian frame
house was squashed into rubble by the storm. ``This town is not
immune to destructive forces. This is the most recent and
destructive it has ever faced.''
   ``Charleston always survives, come hell or high water. Life goes
on. We'll come back,'' said Barbara Simmons, 50, who rode out the
storm in a picturesque brick home built in 1840 whose doorway bears
an odd angle from the 1886 earthquake.
   Contributions for the restoration of the historic homes are
being accepted by the Historic Charleston Foundation Disaster Fund.

<HEAD>Bush Wants Trade, Economic Measures to Help Colombia</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, reaffirming confidence in
Colombian President Virgilio Barco's fight against drug lords, says
he wants to reopen talks on coffee export prices and launch other
economic measures to help bolster the South American nation's
economy.
   Bush told Barco on Thursday that the United States wants
Colombia to get sufficient economic aid as his embattled government
faces up to drug traffickers who have declared all out war, White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Barco saw Bush at the White House before traveling to New York
to address the United Nations today.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills will head an ``interagency
effort to examine urgently what can be done'' on trade relations to
boost U.S. benefits to Colombia, particularly with agricultural and
manufactured items, Fitzwater said in a written statement.
   Bush also told Barco the United States will ``work with the
international financial institutions to support increased economic
assistance for Colombia,'' the statement said.
   Bush wants to resolve ``fundamental problems'' with the
now-defunct International Coffee Agreement that led him last week
to turn down Barco's request for an extension of that pact to
benefit Colombian coffee growers, Fitzwater said.
   At a photo session in the Rose Garden before their 1{-hour
meeting, Barco told reporters he was not seeking any more U.S.
military aid beyond the $65 million package Bush ordered this
summer.
   ``We are not asking for more assistance. We have received ...
help with our problem,'' he said without elaboration.
   Fitzwater said Bush told Barco he would encourage other
countries to support Colombia's efforts against the cocaine cartels.
   In August, Bush ordered the Pentagon to sent $65 million in
military equipment, weapons and supplies to help Colombian security
forces. Bush is requesting some $90 million more from Congress for
the next fiscal year.
   Some Colombian officials have criticized the aid package as not
suited to their needs. They said they need police equipment to
track down the traffickers, while the U.S. aid is primarily
military equipment such as helicopters and other troop transport
vehicles.
   Joining Bush for the meeting with Barco were Bush's top drug
policy advisers: drug policy coordinator William Bennett, Attorney
Gen. Dick Thornburgh, chief of staff John Sununu, Deputy Secretary
of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft.
   Barco also met Thursday with Bennett under tight security at the
Colombian ambassador's residence.
   Administration officials previously have said Bush is willing to
discuss the coffee import matter, even as he turned down Barco's
request to reinstate an export quota system that helped Colombian
coffee growers.
   ``The president indicated his intention to work closely with
President Barco to expand bilateral trade and investment
opportunities in order to spur Colombia's economic growth,''
Fitzwater said.
   Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nation
International Coffee Agreement collapsed in July after the United
States pulled out in a price dispute with coffee-producing nations.
The agreement had set quotas for member nations' exports aimed at
supporting prices of beans at $1.20 per pound or more. The United
States wanted an increase in export quotas for higher-quality
coffees enjoyed by U.S. consumers.
   Colombian officials have suggested it will be difficult to
convince farmers to grow coffee instead of coca, for lucrative
cocaine production, if coffee export prices continue to slip.
   Bush, in a letter to Barco last week, said the United States was
ready to negotiate for a new quota system but would not adhere to
the now-defunct agreement.
   Barco's visit to the United States came against a backdrop of
almost daily terrorist bombings attributed to drug lords in his
country. Since Barco ordered emergency measures to crack down on
the drug traffickers following the Aug. 18 assassination of a
leading presidential candidate, police say eight people have been
killed and 37 injured in the widespread explosions.
   Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been
killed in attacks believed carried out by drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops for Fifth Day, Stocks Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped against the Japanese yen for the
fifth-straight day Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange fell moderately.
   The dollar closed at 139.35 yen, down 1.50 yen from Thursday's
close of 140.85 yen. After opening at 140.60 yen, the currency
ranged between 139.10 yen and 140.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 53.22
points, or 0.14 percent, closing the week at 35,634.76. The index
gained 319.41 points for a record-high closing of 35,689.98 points
Thursday.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's slide to coordinated
intervention by the Japanese, U.S. and British central banks.
   They said Friday marked the Bank of Japan's fifth day of
dollar-selling intervention in the Tokyo market since Monday, when
central banks from other nations stepped into the market to join in
bringing the dollar down.
   The Bank of Japan customarily does not comment on its
interventions, but it sold $200 million during Friday morning's
session, Kyodo News Service said.
   Central bank intervention has also taken place on overseas
markets following Saturday's meeting in Washington of the group of
seven (G-7) leading industrialized countries.
   In the Washington meeting, financial ministers and central
bankers from Japan, the United States, Britain, West Germany,
France, Italy and Canada agreed to cooperate closely in foreign
exchange markets.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index edged up during the day's
morning trading, but held back on profit-taking in the afternoon,
stock dealers said.

<HEAD>Key Figure in Cultural Revolution Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chen Boda, who advised Mao Tse-tung for 30
years before leading purges during the Cultural Revolution, has
died in Beijing of heart failure, local media reported today. He
was 85.
   Chen died at his Beijing home on Sept. 20, the Hong Kong China
News Service service and newspapers reported. He was cremated
Thursday, they said.
   In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry refused comment on Chen's death.
   Chen was jailed after his downfall in 1970 for allegedly
supporting Defense Minister Lin Biao in a power struggle against
Mao. He spent his last years living with his son in the Chinese
capital.
   In 1980, Chen was put on trial along with the so-called Gang of
Four, the radical leaders of the Cultural Revolution. The man whom
the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, dubbed the ``mad
persecutor'' was sentenced to 18 years in jail for
``counterrevolutionary activities'' and purging innocent people.
   Officials disclosed in early 1988 that Chen had been released on
probation for medical reasons, but did not say when or give his
whereabouts. The Hong Kong news service, which disclosed Chen's
death, said he has been out of prison since late 1981.
   His body was cremated at the Babaoshan crematorium, and about 25
friends as well as his son, Chen Xiaonong, and daughter, Chen
Lingmei, attended, according to reports. There was no mention of
participation by high-level officials.
   Chen was born in 1904 in coastal Fujian province and joined the
Communist Party in the mid-1920s. He studied in Moscow for four
years, returning in 1930 to teach at China College in Beijing.
   When the Japanese occupied Beijing in 1937, Chen went west to
Yenan, the remote base of China's Communist Party leaders. He
taught at the party school and began his long friendship with Mao.
   Over the next decade Chen, as Mao's personal and political
secretary, counseled him while he wrote some of his most famous
essays and speeches. He played a major role in drafting the new
constitution of Communist-ruled China after 1949 and in 1958 became
first editor of the party's ideological journal, the Red Flag.
   He accompanied Mao on his only foreign trips, his 1949 and 1957
visits to Moscow.
   In 1966 Mao appointed Chen head of a four-member group assigned
to lead the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution by mobilizing
China's masses to denounce alleged ``capitalist roaders'' in the
party and purge the nation of bourgeois influences.
   Chen used the post to orchestrate campaigns against top
officials, including party General Secretary Deng Xiaoping. He was
regarded as the fourth most powerful person in China, behind Mao,
Mao's designated successor Lin Biao and Premier Chou En-lai.
   Almost 3,000 people died and 84,000 were persecuted in the
factional fighting that followed, according to official figures.
   He was arrested shortly after an August 1970 party Central
Committee plenum at which Mao had, for the first time, publicly
criticized his appointed heir, Lin, with whom Chen was closely
associated.
   Chen was denounced as a member of the ``Lin Biao Clique.'' For
the next decade Chen was rumored to be dead.
   He reappeared in 1980, when he was tried with nine others for
conspiring with Lin or abusing power during the Cultural Revolution.
   ``I plead guilty,'' he told the judge. ``I have nothing to say
to defend myself.''

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of communist
Afghanistan says his country is ready for democratic reform and and
urged Washington to send an envoy for talks on ending the
U.S.-backed insurgency.
   Also Thursday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
offered to mediate between Israel and the PLO and said they could
meet on Soviet soil.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco, fighting a deadly war with
drug traffickers, today addresses the 44th General Assembly and
officials said there would be heavy security.
   Afghan Foreign Minister in Abdul Wakil announced that his
country's Communist Party ``has abandoned the monopoly of power''
since the last Soviet troops withdrew in February.
   ``We are ready to welcome in Kabul a special envoy of the U.S.
administration for a fact-finding mission and for the exchange of
views,'' he said. Washington would find Kabul is ready to institute
a ``democratic system based on political pluralism and a free
economy,'' Wakil said.
   The United States backs the Moslem guerrillas in their
11-year-old war against the communist government of Afghanistan.
   Barco was expected to express gratitude for international aid
for his month-old battle against cocaine kingpins while asking for
more assistance, particularly economic aid and price supports for
coffee and other crops.
   The United States has sent $65 million in emergency military
aid. Britain announced Wednesday it would also send military and
communications equipment.
   In Washington on Thursday, Barco said he was not looking for
more tools to fight drug lords and U.S. officials said he discussed
trade issues.
   U.N. security officials said protective measures would be tight
at U.N. headquarters today for Barco's visit. Since the drug war
began in mid-August, traffickers have been blamed for more than 100
bombs in Colombia that killed at least 10 people.
   The first speaker scheduled today was Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak, who was expected to discuss his offer to host
Israeli-Palestinian talks on ending the 21-month-old Palestinian
uprising. At least 575 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have died in
the Arab revolt against Israeli rule of the occupied territories.
   Mubarak's proposal would have the two sides discuss ways to
smooth Israel's plan for elections in the territories. Israel's
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens was silent on the Egyptian plan when
he spoke to the Assembly on Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze met Thursday with Arens. Both praised the
improvement in Soviet-Israeli relations but said there were no
immediate plans to resume full diplomatic ties, severed by the
Soviets 22 years ago during the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``I even proposed my good offices to organize such a meeting
(between Israel and the PLO on the territory of the Soviet Union,''
Shevardnadze later told reporters. ``That could be a very good
meeting and a sensation for reporters.''
   There was no immediate comment from the Israeli side on the
Soviet offer. However, Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO,
which it views as a terrorist group.
   The Philippines on Thursday formally recognized the Palestine
Liberation Organization as the state of Palestine and said at the
United Nations that it ``respects its right to independent
statehood.''

<HEAD>Nation's Ruler Sypathetic To General Strike Against IMF Measures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril offered his
sympathy to strikers who shut the country down for a day over
economic austerity measures required by international lenders.
   But Avril said Thursday that Haiti had no choice but to
negotiate with the International Monetary Fund for a $26.5 million
standby loan.
   ``We had a knife to our throat,'' Avril said in an interview
broadcast by the Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soleil.
   The 24-hour general strike closed all businesses and most
factories on Wednesday and paralyzed all public transportation in
Port-au-Prince and virtually the entire nation of 6 million.
   ``The strike was a success,'' Avril said. ``I would have gone on
strike, too, because I don't agree with everything they (the IMF)
demanded. I don't agree with the Monetary Fund deal. I don't agree
with poverty. I don't agree with insecurity.''
   The strike was called by 32 leftist and conservative political
and labor groups and had the tacit support of the Chamber of
Commerce and the Haitian Association of Industrialists.
   The groups called for withdrawal of last month's austerity
measures, including a tariff increase on imports and a lowering of
the ceiling on taxable businesses to include those that earn as
little as $25,000 a year.
   The measures were an attempt to increase government revenue,
curb a deficit that has reached about $60 million this year, and
reduce Haiti's $800 million foreign debt _ three times this
impoverished Caribbean nation's annual budget.
   The strikers also demanded a price cut for food staples and
respect for human rights.

   From the side of her husband's casket, Imelda
Marcos pledged to return Ferdinand E. Marcos' body to his homeland
for burial despite Philippine and U.S. government orders barring
such a move.
   ``This is so cruel, so inhuman and so immoral,'' Mrs. Marcos
told reporters Thursday night in the living room of the hillside
home where the former Philippine president and his wife lived
during most of their 3{-year exile.
   She said there were no immediate plans for burial, and an aide
suggested that, barring their return to the Philippines, Marcos'
remains might be above ground for a long time.
   Marcos, 72, died Thursday at St. Francis Medical Center after
nearly 10 months in the hospital. Doctors said kidney and lung
failure and a widespread infection contributed to cardiac arrest
that caused his death.
   His successor, Corazon Aquino, refused to allow Marcos' body to
return to his homeland for burial in the interest of ``the
tranquility of the state and the order of society.''
   Mrs. Aquino ordered Philippine flags flown at half-mast until
Sunday on all government buildings out of respect for Marcos.
   Later Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration in
Washington prohibited any aircraft from flying Marcos' remains out
of the United States for the Philippines, saying it would ``create
a danger to the safety of the aircraft and the persons involved.''
   But Mrs. Marcos dismissed that rationale with a gesture toward
her husband's open casket in the living room of the family's
mansion.
   ``How can you feel this man is dangerous to security when he is
resting at peace forever?'' she said.
   Marcos, his face clearly visible beneath a pane of glass, was
dressed in an off-white Filipino shirt called a barong tagalog. The
casket was draped with a Philippine flag, and the presidential seal
of the Philippines was mounted on the wall behind the casket.
   About two dozen mourners wept and prayed in the living room. Van
loads of flowers arrived throughout the day.
   Mrs. Marcos, clad in black, told reporters Marcos had left his
estate to the Philippine people. She did not elaborate and attorney
John Bartko would not comment on the bequest.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, said she had made no funeral plans. She said
she would not consider burying Marcos in the United States while
she had hope Mrs. Aquino would change her mind.
   ``I have always considered that his wish and every Filipinos'
wish is to be laid to rest in the Philippines,'' Mrs. Marcos said.
``I continue to believe that sooner or later he will be.''
   ``Burial in the U.S. will be considered like turning off the
life support systems,'' family spokesman Roger Peyuan said. ``She
will decide that at the last minute.''
   Marcos' mother, who died in May 1988, has been embalmed several
times and lies unburied in the Philippines because Marcos was not
allowed into the country for her funeral.
   Marcos ruled the Philippines for more than 20 years before being
ousted in February 1986 by a popular insurrection that placed Mrs.
Aquino in power. Mrs. Aquino's government has survived six armed
attempts to overthrow it, many by officers formerly loyal to Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos said she would continue to defend her husband
against allegations he stole as much as $10 billion from the
impoverished archipelago and stashed the money abroad in bank
accounts, property and extravagant purchases.
   ``We are not guilty,'' said Mrs. Marcos, who pleaded innocent to
federal racketeering charges in a New York court last October and
is free on $5 million bail.
   Marcos' failing health prevented him from being tried.
   Peyuan said the Marcos home would remain open to mourners 24
hours a day until Sunday, then his body will be taken to a local
mortuary for viewing through Thursday.

<HEAD>Social Christian Leader Leaves Anti-Sandinista Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of the 14-party coalition
opposing the sandinista government said he dropped out of the bloc
because leftists in the organization want to limit the number of
candidates his party can field.
   Today is the deadline by which candidates must register for the
February elections. But 24 hours before the cutoff, the National
Opposition Union was still debating which parliamentary seats each
member party could run for.
   Mauricio Diaz, president of the People's Social Christian Party,
said the coalition offered his party an unacceptable two
candidacies, while the Communist and Socialist parties were offered
six seats each.
   Diaz said his party was the fourth largest vote-getter in the
1984 elections, while the Communists were fifth and the Socialists
sixth.
   ``Leftist parties within coalition have too much influence and
great power,'' Diaz said at the news conference.
   But a spokesman for the Opposition Union said Thursday that
high-ranking members of Diaz's party denied there was a split in
ranks.
   ``The coalition's political council is in session right now ...
and the executive commission of the People's Social Christian Party
is in the meeting,'' Union spokesman Luis Sanchez said after Diaz
announced his decision.
   ``They insist that the party as such will maintain itself within
coalition and that if Diaz is breaking away, he's doing so on his
own,'' Sanchez said.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the opposition
newspaper La Prensa, and Virgilio Godoy are the coalition's
presidential and vice presidential candidates for the Feb. 25
elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro and Godoy are running against President Daniel
Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front, which has held power for a decade.
   Diaz told reporters his party would support Erick Ramirez, the
presidential candidate of the splinter Social Christian Party.
Diaz's party has six deputies in the National Assembly and is the
third-largest opposition party in the country's single-chamber
legislature.
   The current National Assembly has 96 deputies.
   According to the Nicaraguan Constitution the Assembly has 90
seats, but defeated presidential candidates are guaranteed one
place each and six candidates ran aginst the Sandinistas in 1984
elections.
   Besides the opposition coalition and the Sandinista Front, at
least six parties are running presidential candidates in next
year's vote.
   The choice of Godoy as the vice presidential candidate four
weeks ago created a crisis in the coalition because some parties
favored a conservative businessman. Godoy was eventually accepted,
but not before some parties had threatened to break away.

   The Bush administration is ready to approve a
$3.2 billion contract enabling Saudi Arabia to buy American-made
tanks, says Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio.
   The deal, involving 315 M-1 A-2 tanks, should be finalized by
the end of the year, Oxley said Thursday.
   General Dynamics Corp. will build the tanks if the arrangement
is completed. By law, Congress must have the chance to say no to
the sale.

<NOTE>New Bush Steel Plan Is Questioned</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's new steel import
restrictions probably will work for a while, but the program may
never attain its goal of ending unfair steel trading practices
overseas, a labor leader says.
   The administration is completing hurried negotiations and
expects to reach its deadline of having a new steel import
restraint program with 29 nations in place by Sunday, a top trade
official said Thursday.
   ``There will be a steel program as of Oct. 1,'' Deputy U.S.
Trade Representative Linn Williams told a conference of steel
manufacturers. ``We may have some cleanup to do after Sept. 30, but
we will have a new program Oct. 1.''
   The program will replace a series of five-year, Reagan
administration steel trade pacts that expire Saturday. The
scaled-down Bush version will last 2{ years.
   The goal is to give domestic firms continued breathing space
from imports by placing new, product-by-product caps on the volume
of steel products shipped into the United States.
   The Bush administration also is asking nations to commit to
steps designed to remove government steel subsidies or other free
trade barriers by March 31, 1992.
   Steel labor is backing the Bush program but has expressed doubts
about whether a meaningful consensus on free trade can be achieved.
   ``We have many reservations about whether that's possible,''
said United Steelworkers President Lynn Williams, who is not
related to his Bush administration namesake.
   Williams said the pacts may work for a while, but after they
expire, import pressure may again begin to build.

<NOTE>Toy Retailer Voluntarily Recalls Baby Rattles</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major toy retailer is voluntarily recalling
11,000 baby rattles because parts of the toy may become detached
and choke young children, a government spokeswoman says.
   The ``Wooden Shaky Head Rattles'' were sold nationwide for about
$2 each in 1988 and 1989 by Toys `R' Us, Inc.
   The toy consists of a six and one-half inch wooden handle topped
with a red, yellow, pink or black head-shaped rattle which has
springs hanging from each side. Attached to the springs are two
small wooden balls.
   The rattle ``fails to meet the Consumer Product Safety
Commission mandatory standard for rattles that is intended to
prevent choking accidents involving young children,'' Anne Graham,
the panel's acting chairman, said Thursday.
   Consumers should take the rattles away from children and return
them to the nearest Toys `R' Us store for a refund, the commission
said.
   Graham said there had been no reported injuries associated with
the toy but the recall was being made as a preventive action.

<HEAD>With Corruption Probe Complete, New Elections Planned For November</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With former Premier Andreas Papandreou and
others indicted on corruption charges, officials said the task of
the conservative-communist governing coalition is complete and new
elections will be held.
   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis said Thursday that
Parliament will be dissolved a week from today so elections can
take place on Nov. 5.
   Papandreou was indicted Thursday on charges involving an alleged
$210 million bank embezzlement scandal, and last week on charges he
instigated a widespread illegal wiretapping network.
   The 70-year-old leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement has
denied involvement in both scandals, saying he is the victim of a
conspiracy aimed at his ``political annihilation.''
   Also Thursday, tens of thousands of people gathered at an Athens
cathedral for the funeral liturgy of prominent deputy Pavlos
Bakoyannis, a conservative lawmaker gunned down by the leftist
November 17 guerrilla group.
   The conservative New Democracy party and the Communist-dominated
Coalition of the Left and Progress took power after June elections
left a splintered Parliament. They joined exclusively to prosecute
politicians involved in scandals, before new elections for the
300-member one-chamber Parliament.
   Judicial and parliamentary inquiries have implicated Papandreou,
four of his former senior ministers, and about 200 other people.
   All five will stand trial before a special 13-member high court
that will convene by late November, raising the possibility
Papandreou will campaign for office in the coming elections while
under indictment.

<HEAD>Plane Touched Down, Rolled Before Smashing Into Trees, Killing 10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSAYAN, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Grand Canyon sightseeing plane that
crashed on a landing approach, killing 10 people, touched down hard
and scraped its right wing, then veered off and rolled nearly 180
degrees before smashing into a stand of trees, federal officials
said.
   Investigators are checking to see if the crash was related to
another landing problem seven months ago in the same aircraft, a de
Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter, said John Lauber of the National
Transportation Safety Board. In that incident, the plane's wing
also struck the ground.
   ``Clearly, as we get further into this and are able to examine
whatever other information we can find out about that, that's a
possibility, but at this point we have nothing to tie those
together,'' Lauber said Thursday.
   Preliminary results indicate the plane's two engines were
accelerating when the crash occurred, Lauber said, but he refused
to speculate whether the pilot was trying to abort the landing and
regain altitude.
   Weather was not a factor in the crash at the Grand Canyon
Airport, he said.
   Tests of the pilots' blood and fuel analyses were incomplete.
   Federal Aviation Administraton records show the 14-year-old
plane had a problem while landing at the airport on Feb. 27, when
it lost directional control and struck a wingtip on the runway. The
records said the plane had a ``possible nose-wheel-centering
problem.''
   No one was injured in the earlier accident, in which wind was
listed as a contributing factor, according to the FAA records.
   The earlier flight was piloted by a new employee who was being
supervised by William Welch of Sedona, Ariz., the pilot killed in
Wednesday's crash, said Ronald L. Warren, vice president and
general manager of Grand Canyon Airlines.
   Welch, 47, and copilot Keith Crosson, 43, of Kailua-Kona,
Hawaii, were killed along with eight passengers.
   Three survivors were in serious condition, one was in guarded
condition and seven were in stable condition Thursday at Flagstaff
Medical Center, about 75 miles away.
   ``It all happened in a flash,'' said Katherine Mayes, who
suffered a broken pelvis and a severely bruised right shoulder. Ms.
Mayes described how the plane ``shot straight up'' and flipped over.
   She said she looked out the nearby window and found herself ``in
the middle of a pine forest.'' Inside the wreckage, she saw a woman
hanging upside down in her seat and other passengers entangled in
the debris.
   ``I crawled as far away as I could,'' said Ms. Mayes, 66, of
Nashville, Tenn. ``And I waited for the medics. I'm sure they got
there as fast as they could, but it seemed an eternity.''
   Lauber said the plane was returning to the airport 10 miles
south of the South Rim after an aerial tour of the Grand Canyon.
   The FAA tower had cleared the landing and everything appeared to
be normal, Lauber said.
   As the plane touched down, however, the right wingtip struck the
runway, and the landing was hard enough on the right side to put
``scrub marks'' on the right tire.
   The craft soared and rolled so that its left wing was nearly
vertical to the ground. It struck a stand of ponderosa pine 300
yards off the pavement.
   Lauber said transcripts of radio communication between air
traffic controllers and the pilot revealed nothing unusual. There
were ``a couple of unintelligible transmissions'' after the final
clearance to land was given that sound experts were scrutinizing
for clues.
   Lauber said the engines would be removed and shipped to Montreal
for examination by Pratt &amp; Whitney, the manufacturer.
   Welch had worked 3{ years for the airline and logged about 2,000
hours of flight time, Lauber said. Crosson was in his first year
with the airline.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rebel offensive this week has
left at least 11 people dead, government and rebel sources said.
   An armed forces communique on Thursday said that in the previous
48 hours, seven rebels and two soldiers were killed while 16 other
people were wounded. Two policemen were also killed.
   Guerrillas on Tuesday began a nationwide military operation,
attacking army positions in 10 of the 14 provinces to protest what
they say is repression against grassroots movements sympathetic to
them.
   Officials of President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government
and high-ranking military officers have said the guerrilla
offensive endangers a second round of talks between the two sides
scheduled for Oct. 16-17.
   The rebels said their fighters killed or wounded 40 soldiers but
did not report their own casualties.
   In the latest attack, a policeman was fatally shot Thursday
while guarding the Central Bank, the country's federal reserve.
Witnesses and police sources said on condition of anonymity that
gunmen shot the patrolman, Concepcion de Jesus Fajardo, shortly
before midday and fled the scene.
   Late Wednesday, another patrolman standing guard outside some
new high-rise buildings in the capital also was shot dead. Miguel
Angel Borga was one of several patrolmen guarding the Colonia
Militar, a neighborhood where ranking military officers live.
   Police sources said unidentified sprayed the policemen with
automatic weapons, killing Borga.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebel coalition
claimed responsibility for the two police slayings through
anonymous telephone calls to news media. The callers did not say
why the patrla casualties, three deaths and
seven injuries, the army said. It said no soldiers were killed or
wounded in that clash.
   Rebels on Tuesday attacked the San Salvador residence of Col.
Mauricio Vargas, commander of the eastern military zone, wounding
the officer's father, the army said.
   The home is near the civil defense headquarters in the capital's
southern suburb of Los Planes de Renderos. Rebels reported
attacking civil defense installations in Los Planes but did not
mention the colonel's house.
   Rebel reports said four officers and nine soldiers were taken
prisoner during attacks on 18 towns.
   Rebel and government representatives met this month in Mexico
City to try to negotiate an end to the 10-year-old war in which
70,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians. The talks
were the first between the two sides since Cristiani took office
June 1.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov, the Soviet-born ballet
star, has resigned abruptly as artistic director of the American
Ballet Theater in a dispute with the company's management.
   Baryshnikov resigned Thursday after the board refused to rescind
a decision by the company's new executive director to place an
assistant to Baryshnikov on a year's leave of absence.
   Baryshnikov, who defected from the Soviet Union in 1974, had
announced in June he planned to resign from the ABT in 1990 to
further personal endeavors, including an acting career.
   Jane Hermann, the new executive director, said in a letter
Wednesday that the former star of the Sovet Union's Kirov Ballet
gave the company an ultimatum.
   The dispute also involved financial problems and Baryshnikov's
refusal to sponsor fund-raising efforts for the institute, The New
York Times said today.
   The ABT had a $1 million operating deficit during the summer,
and $1.5 million was chopped from the company's budget at
Wednesday's board meeting.
   Baryshnikov, who does not receive a salary at ABT, said in a
letter written Monday by his manager, Edgar Vincent, that the
removal of his assistant, Charles France, infringed on his artistic
authority. France has been reported ill.
   ``If the board sanctions the decision to sever relations with
Charles, then it must realize that Misha's association with A.B.T.
will cease as of today,'' Vincent said in the letter, referring to
Baryshnikov by his nickname.
   Ms. Hermann said she had asked France to complete the final year
of his contract on leave at full salary and benefits, but he
continued to do work for the company.
   ``This request was totally ignored and he (France) continued to
pursue business on behalf of the company which was inconsistent
with the artistic and financial planning which I was attempting to
implement,'' The Washington Post reported Hermann's letter said.
   ``This caused us to work at cross-purposes,'' she said.
   Baryshnikov also threatened to withdraw the ballets he staged if
the casts he directed during his tenure are not used.
   ``I'm not taking orders from anyone, especially unfair ones,''
he told the Times in an interview. ``I left one country for those
very reasons.''

<TEXT>
   A man who spent 18 months in jail for having
illicit sex with his ex-wife is suing for custody of their two
sons, claiming she exposed them to bad influences.
   ``I feel like I can give them a better life, offer them more
love and security,'' said James David Moseley. ``I don't want them
in any kind of environment that would not be good for them.''
   In the lawsuit filed Thursday, Moseley said his former wife has
``exposed the children to influences which are extremely
detrimental to (their) well-being and best interest.''
   No further details of the lawsuit were immediately available.
   The children's mother, Bette Lee Roberts, was awarded custody of
their sons when the couple's divorce became final in April 1988.
   Neither Ms. Roberts nor her attorney could be reached for
comment Thursday.
   Moseley originally was charged with rape and sexual assault. He
was acquitted of those charges but was found guilty of the lesser
charge of oral sodomy under a 156-year-old Georgia law.
   He was released Aug. 30 on appeal, and a judge later overturned
the conviction. The judge ruled that Georgia's sodomy law cannot be
applied to consenting married adults.
   Moseley, a 35-year-old carpenter, has not seen his sons, Daryl
Gene, 4, and Mark Warren, 2, since his imprisonment. He said he
will not fight to deny Ms. Roberts visitation rights.
   During his trial, Moseley testified that he believed his wife
had the sexual assault charges filed partly because she wanted to
sabotage his plans to seek custody of the boys.

<HEAD>1,600 Soviet Emigrants Enter U.S. in a Single Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest group of Jewish refugees to come to
the United States in a single day in more than 40 years landed in
time to celebrate the Jewish New Year here.
   Kennedy International Airport was the scene of emotional
reunions Thursday as the Soviet refugees _ including 1,350 Jews and
250 Pentecostal and Evangelical Christians _ arrived to take
advantage of a processing policy that ends at midnight tonight.
   The agencies that assist Jewish refugees decided to stop the
flow early out of respect for Rosh Hashanah, which begins at
sundown tonight and ends Sunday.
   ``Rosh Hashanah represents a new beginning for every Jew, but
expecially for these people,'' said Karl Zukerman, executive
director of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, who spent most of the
day greeting the new arrivals.
   ``I dreamed of this day for a long time,'' said Zena Gadelova,
as she embraced her four younger brothers, whom she hadn't seen in
five years. They arrived with 17 other relatives, including wives,
children and in-laws.
   New U.S. policies will mean longer waits for Soviet emigrants at
a time when the Soviet Union is allowing record numbers to leave.
Last year, 18,965 Jews emigrated, up from 8,155 in 1987. This year
that number is expected to near 50,000.
   Instead of being processed in Europe, as in the past, the
refugees' paperwork will be handled at the American Embassy in
Moscow, the same as other would-be emigrants.
   Many of the arriving refugees Thursday had been among 14,000
Soviet Jews waiting in Rome for final processing. It was the
largest number of Jewish immigrants to arrive in the United States
on a single day since the end of World War II.
   Mikhail Sukhar of Moscow said he had given up hope of getting
out of Rome before the deadline after his first application to
enter the United States was denied. ``I didn't even reapply, but
they said I could go.''
   U.S. officials have said they will continue to review the
applications of Soviet refugees already waiting in Rome and Vienna.
   Since the early 1970s, both Jews and Christians who wanted to
leave Moscow applied for Israeli visas at the Dutch Embassy, which
performed consular functions for Israel in Moscow.
   They would then proceed to Vienna or Rome, where as many as 90
percent of the Soviet Jews expressed a desire to go to the United
States. Their applications almost automatically were approved by
U.S. immigration officials.
   The Israeli government has asked the United States to change the
policy in the hope of attracting more Soviet Jews to settle in
Israel, but State Department officials deny the policy change was
at Israel's behest.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two-thirds of Americans say in a new poll it is
likely that abortions in their states will be further restricted in
the next year, a newspaper reported today.
   The New York Times@CBS News Poll found that 43 percent of
respondents said abortion should be legal as it is now while 13
percent said it should not be allowed at all. Forty percent said
abortion should be legal only in cases such as rape, incest or to
save the mother's life.
   The national telephone poll of 1,347 adults, taken from Sept.
17-20, found 65 percent said they expected more state limits on
abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision this summer
upholding a restrictive Missouri law. The poll's findings have a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, the Times
said.
   Sixty-six percent of those surveyed said they were very or
somewhat concerned that women may lose the right to have an
abortion; 31 percent said they were not very concerned or not
concerned at all.
   Concerning possible restrictions, 70 percent of respondents
favored requiring the consent of the parents before a girl under 18
could have an abortion.
   Sixty-five percent favored requiring a test in a pregnancy of 20
weeks or more to make sure the fetus has not developed enough to
live outside the womb. Thirty-five percent of respondents favored
prohibiting public employees or public hospitals from performing
abortions.
   The poll also found that 69 percent of respondents agreed with
the following statement: ``Even in cases where you might think
abortion is the wrong thing to do, the Government has no business
preventing a woman from having an abortion.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules, Former Inmates React in ``Titicut Follies'' Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BOSTON (AP)_ A judge lifted a 22-year-old ban of a film
depicting atrocities at a state mental asylum, with the condition
that the filmmaker blur the faces of inmates who prefer their grim
treatment remain a secret.
   Judge Andrew Gill Meyer's ruling Thursday released the 1967
documentary ``Titicut Follies,'' by Frederick Wiseman, an
award-winning director known for his stark potrayal of subjects
like hospitals, racetracks and the men whose fingers are on the
buttons that fire nuclear missiles.
   The 85-minute, black and white film depicts the moldering, often
cruel, conditions at Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally
insane, built in 1852 and replaced with new buildings since the
film's production.
   Many scenes depict nude men in bare cells being baited by
sadistic guards. One man is shown being force fed as he lies on a
table and a liquid is poured down a rubber hose shoved into his
nose. The film has no narrator.
   It was ordered withheld from the public six weeks after its New
York debut on grounds it violated the privacy of the 62 featured
inmates.
   In his ruling, Meyer said that inmates who still wish to remain
anonymous, or those who are incompetent to judge, must appear with
their faces blurred.
   In reconsidering the ban, Meyer solicited comments from the
inmates portrayed in the film, many of whom have died or could not
be located. The judge said seven of 20 inmates located were
competent to decide whether they wanted their identities masked.
   Some of those who appear in the film don't want to revisit the
dehumanization they endured, but others say the abuse they suffered
must be exposed.
   ``To me, it was like a concentration camp,'' said Vladimir
Semyonov, 51, who spent eight years at Bridgewater and now bags
groceries and lives in Brockton, 15 miles south of Boston.
   ``I'm glad they're showing the film _ I want to expose the
state,'' said Semyonov. He said the film may ``make the public take
some interest in conditions at state hospitals.''
   Imposing the ban two decades ago, Judge Harry Kalus labeled the
film a ``nightmare of ghoulish obscenities.''
   His ban, against which Wiseman began fighting two years ago,
wasn't total. Kalus allowed the film to be shown to members of
interested professions and the film has been shown regularly to
psychology students, lawyers, social workers and journalists.
   In his ruling, Meyer tried to resolve the conflict between the
film's potential to embarrass its subjects and the filmmaker's
right for his work to be shown.
   ``I have viewed the film and agree that it is a substantial and
significant intrusion into the privacy of the inmates shown in the
film,'' the judge wrote.
   ``However, I also regarded `Titicut Follies,' as an outstanding
film, artistically and thoughtfully edited with great social and
historical value. ... Another observation about the film: it is
true.''
   State officials have said that since the film was made,
conditions at Bridgewater have been improved, with a better trained
staff and a smaller population.
   The film has been credited by some with forcing improvements at
asylyms.
   Mitchell Sikora, a Boston attorney who was appointed by the
court to interview 17 of the 20 located inmates shown in the
documentary, said Thursday he would need more time to assess the
effect of the ruling.
   Neither Wiseman, a Cambridge-based filmmaker, nor his attorney
returned telephone calls from The Associated Press.

   Drug detective Sgt. Roy Abbott said Zerben Richards Hicks also

   Several uniformed officers surprised Hicks at an apartment

over the first time he was searched and the crack went undetected.
   When the detective told Hicks to stand up straight during a
second search, a corner of the bag was observed between folds of

   Hicks was held on a $60,000 bond on charges of unlawful
possession of a controlled substance and possessing drugs without a

<HEAD>Israelis Celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jews throughout Israel today began their
celebration of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, with prayers,
picnics and tight security.
   The beginning of the Hebrew year will not be marked by blowing
the traditional ram's horn, or shofar, in Israel's 8,000 synagogues
because the holiday falls on the Jewish Sabbath, when it is
forbidden to sound the horn.
   Instead, the shofar will be blown on the second day of the new
year festival Sunday.
   The new year 5750 was interpreted by some religious scholars as
the ``year of miracles'' because 50 stands for the letter ``n'' in
Hebrew. The scholars linked the ``n'' to the word ``nisim,'' or
miracle.
   But some newspapers interpreted the new year as the root to the
word ``tashan,'' or sleep, suggesting weariness over the 21-month
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the territories.
   At least 575 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops and
civilians during the revolt. Forty Israelis also have been slain in
the violence.
   To prevent the uprising from interfering in the holiday, the
army blocked travel into Israel by residents of the Gaza Strip
until Monday morning and increased searches of Palestinians
entering from the West Bank.
   Overnight, police in Israel's Galilee rounded up 105
Palestinians who broke the law prohibiting residents of the
territories from spending the night in Israel.
   The army also increased patrols along the Lebanese and Jordanian
borders and police were reinforced throughout the country to head
off possible guerrilla attacks.
   ``We want not only to ensure a feeling of safety but to let the
people of Israel celebrate as they choose,'' Police commissioner
David Krauss said on Israel radio.
   Rosh Hashana is celebrated on the first and second day of the
Jewish month of Tishrei. It marks the beginning of the ``10 days of
awe,'' when Jews reflect on their deeds of the past year and repent
for their sins.
   The period culminates in the fast of Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement, which comes on Oct. 9.
   Tonight, the start of the holiday, Jewish families gather for
traditional dinners, eating apples dipped in honey to signify a
``sweet new year.''
   Ashkenazim, or Jews of European origin, eat a festive meal that
traditionally includes chopped liver and gefilte fish, while
Sephardim, Jews from the Middle East, eat couscous and fish heads.
   Vacationers, enjoying a long weekend, flocked to beaches in Tel
Aviv and other coastal cities, taking advantage of sunny skies and
80-degree weather.

<TEXT>
   A young mother accused of swapping her
3-month-old boy for $20 worth of crack cocaine was arrested after
the father saw his son on the television news.
   The father said Thursday he will fight for custody of the child,
who had been retrieved by a customer in the bar where the alleged
trade took place. The baby, apparently unharmed, was turned over to
state family services officials.
   ``This is one more example of how pathetic drug addiction can
be,'' said Sgt. Gregory Mills, a police spokesman.
   Lisa Price, 23, was charged Thursday with one count each of
child endangerment and abandonment, police said.
   The 23-year-old father, Ronald Saffold, turned on the TV news
Wednesday night and saw his son, Johnathan, in a policeman's arms.
Saffold called 911 and by early evening police were able to
identify the boy and mother.
   Saffold said he and Ms. Price had another child, a 1-year-old
daughter, but she was taken by the state six months ago.
   Saffold said that Ms. Price had been smoking crack for about a
year. He also said his son seemed well when he saw him Wednesday
night at police headquarters.
   Mills said Ms. Price went into a bar Tuesday night and contacted
an alleged dealer there known as ``the Crack Lady.''
   The young woman said she wanted a $20 rock of cocaine but had no
money. Another customer in the bar said the dealer responded, ``I
sure would like to have a baby boy.''
   The pair walked outside to complete the deal, investigators
said, and the alleged dealer returned to the bar with the baby.
   Another woman in the bar asked the dealer if she could hold the
baby and then took it home and called police in the morning, Mills
said.
   Police said it appeared to mark the first report of a Kansas
City baby being traded for drugs although similar deals have been
reported elsewhere.
   ``I think it's a horrendous example of the vulnerability of
people who are addicted to crack and the extent to which they will
go,'' Mills said.

<HEAD>Death Rate Highest in Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death rate from cervical cancer, which kills
4,500 American women a year, is higher in the Southeast than in
other parts of the country, federal health officials say.
   The disease, the risk of which increases with the number of
sexual partners, killed an average of 4,543 women each year in the
period 1984-86, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said Thursday.
   Average mortality rates were highest in the Southeast, from the
District of Columbia to Louisiana. Nine Southeastern states and the
District of Columbia were among 13 with annual cervical cancer
death rates of more than 45 deaths per million women.
   The nine states were Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and West
Virginia. Others were Alaska, Maine and North Dakota.
   The lowest rates were in Utah and Wyoming, with less than 20
deaths per year per million women.
   Compared with other types of cancer, ``the number of cases per
year is small,'' the CDC said. Cervical cancer accounts for less
than 3 percent of U.S. cancer deaths among women; lung cancer and
breast cancer are the chief causes.
   Nationwide, the mortality rate was 37 per million. The CDC said
earlier this year that rate was down 18 percent since 1979.
   Most women with cervical cancer survive. The National Cancer
Institute reports that from 1974-85, 67 percent of women with
cervical cancer were still alive five years after diagnosis.
   The Atlanta-based CDC said certain types of sexually transmitted
human papillomavirus act as infectious agents, possibly increasing
the risk of cervical cancer. Another risk factor, the CDC said, is
smoking; 29 percent of all cervical cancer death is attributable to
cigarette smoking.
   Pap tests, recommended annually by the American Cancer Society,
aid in early detection and treatment of cervical cancer, the CDC
said.
   A study of cervical cancer cases in Rhode Island in 1987 found
five factors contributing to invasive, or more serious, cervical
cancer: lack of Pap tests, too long a period between tests, rapid
development of the disease between tests, a falsely negative test
result, or lack of treatment following a positive test.
   In patients under 40, most patients either experienced rapid
growth of the disease after a negative test, or had a falsely
negative test result, the CDC said. Among women aged 40-69, most
had waited too long between screenings.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea called for talks among
political and social leaders of the two Koreas on national
unification, but South Korea today rejected the offer as ``obsolete
and nothing new.''
   Choi Byong-bo, spokesman for the government's National
Unification Board, said the proposal is the same one made by the
north's leader, Kim Il Sung, in his New Year messsage. Seoul also
turned down the earlier proposal.
   The latest North Korean overture, broadcast by Pyongyang and
monitored in Tokyo on Thursday, calls for Seoul and Pyongyang to
hold a joint meeting of 60 political and social leaders, equally
divided between them, on Feb. 20 next year to work out a new
unification formula.
   ``The proposal is obsolete and has nothing new in it,'' Choi
said.
   North Korea, in what appeared to be a slight policy change, said
that although it considered its unification formula the most
effective, it also was willing to discuss other measures.
   Some experts in Seoul speculated that Pyongyang may be willing
to modify its longstanding unification formula calling for the two
Koreas to operate as separate states under a confederation. Seoul
has rejected this idea.
   Choi said the north's proposal, made by Kim Yong-nam, that
country's foreign minister, is basically the same. He said the
latest North Korean proposal is aimed at formenting dissident
movements in the south.
   In the past, North Korea demanded the convocation of a joint
meeting of 600 political and social leaders from each side to
discuss unification but this time it cut the number of delegates,
the spokesman said.
   North Korea did not specify the qualifications of delegates but
in the past has said that they should include dissident leaders.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo on Sept. 11 proposed that
Seoul and Pyongyang form a ``Korean commonwealth'' before
unification and build up mutual trust. North Korea immediately
turned down Roh's idea.
   Also today, the South Korean government approved a plan by a
Buddhist organization to invite 30 North Korean monks and laymen to
a Buddhist lantern festival in Seoul next month.
   The approval cleared the way for the Korea Buddhism Sect
Council, a federation of Buddhist orders in South Korea, to invite
North Korean Buddhists to the Oct. 14 festival in Seoul.
   It is unclear whether North Korea would accept the invitations.
If North Korea accepts, it would mark the first religious exchange
between the two Koreas.
   North and South Korea have been bitter rivals since the
peninsula was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They
fought the 1950-53 Korean War.

education, now face a more daunting task: marshaling educators' and
public support for rigorous standards and radical new ways of
running schools.
   Still to come from the governors and the White House in the
months ahead are the specifics of the first national education
goals aimed at reducing the steep dropout rate, shaping students up
in math and science, reducing adult illiteracy and getting more
young children physically and mentally fit to begin their education.
   But as they headed home Thursday from their two-day summit at
the University of Virginia, the president and state executives
agreed that the success of their strategy rests on galvanizing
public support for what Bush termed ``an America of tougher
standards.''
   There were no promissory notes signed, but Bush did commit
himself to the principle of targeting any future funding increases
toward needy preschoolers, for both Head Start, health and
nutrition programs.
   Bush, standing in the sunshine on the lawn outside the Thomas
Jefferson-designed Rotunda, pledged his ``determination to follow
up in every way possible. We just cannot let it sit here and end
here, and I promise you that I won't.''
   Earlier, in a keynote address, Bush declared, ``A social compact
begins today in Charlottesville, Virginia, a compact between
parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, state legislators,
governors and the administration.''
   ``Educational reform is an urgent responsibility for every
parent, every student, every community. And those who do not
advance the cause of education, hinder it,'' he cautioned.
   Former Education Secretary William Bennett was rebuked by White
House chief of staff John Sununu for his comment that the
governors' summit debates were full of ``pap and ... stuff that
rhymes with pap,'' displaying ``a total absence of any knowledge''
about the schools.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Sununu spoke
for Bush when he told Bennett, now the federal drug policy chief,
``Thanks for your comments, they weren't helpful.''
   Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, Republican chairman of the National
Governors' Conference, said the consensus among the governors and
administration officials was that ``Mr. Bennett went overboard''
and ``was somewhat flip in his remarks.''
   For the governors, some of whom have spent much of the 1980s
battling to improve their schools, Bush's message was music to the
ears.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian lamented that now, ``you don't
find many parents who even go to open house in the school their
children are attending. It's a call to them ... to get involved.''
   Deukmejian, a Republican, predicted it will take a decade to
reach the point where American students are getting ``an education
that's just as good as students are receiving in countries like
Japan and Germany.''
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste struck one of the few discordant
notes, suggesting Bush should scrap three $500 million stealth
bombers and spend the money on school reforms instead.
   But even Celeste, a Democrat, acknowledged that stamping ``the
White House `Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' on the reform
agenda is a plus. ... That's very valuable.''
   In seeking school restructuring, Bush and the governors endorsed
stricter accountability focusing on ``results rather than on
compliance with rules and regulations''; decentralization of school
authority and decision-making; and ``real rewards'' for teachers
who succeed with students and ``real consequences for failure.''
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said the accord on national goals is ``potentially a
major turning point for education in this country.''
   Shanker said Bush has embraced ``a kind of experimentation and
child-oriented approach rather than the rigid conservative
approach, which is to go back to the old system and put the screws
on.''
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
said, ``There are no broad goals that we can't work with.'' But he
predicted it will take some ``tough discussions'' to define the
broad goals outlined at the summit.
   A governors' task force and administration officials will seek
to define those goals by the governors' regular winter meeting in
February.
   The accord also commits Bush and the governors to seek ``greater
flexibility and enhanced accountability'' in federal school aid, to
push state efforts to restructure schools and to report annually
``on progress in achieving our goals.''
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner said, ``We will have a report
card'' evaluating not only the schools, but how the states and
Washington fulfill their roles.
   A happy but weary Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton said, ``Not only
are we going to set national performance goals ... but we stand
here before you and tell you we expect to be held personally
accountable.''

   The Interior Ministry said today it will
disband the ZOMO riot police, the widely scorned paramilitary units
long associated with the Communist government's repression of
opposition activists.
   The helmeted police, with shields and batons, were especially
active following the imposition of martial law in December 1981.
   The Interior Ministry, which controls the police, is still run
by the Communists, one of four cabinet posts retained by the party
after the formation this month of the East bloc's first
non-Communist-led government under Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki.
   The decision to disband the ZOMO was made to save money and
remove an ``irritation'' for society, said Wojciech Garstka, a
ministry spokesman.
   The ZOMO squads will be replaced by special ``preventive patrol
units'' of the civic militia, as the police force is called, to be
established in 22 of Poland's 49 provinces, the state PAP news
agency said.
   In addition, the power to deploy the forces will be removed from
provincial police chiefs and reserved for the office of the prime
minister, a government presidium or the Interior Minister at their
instruction, Garstka said.
   ``This is one of the most important changes because those troops
were not bad by themselves but the formula for using them was wrong
sometimes, and this formula is changing,'' the spokesman said.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak had said this month in
parliamentary hearings that he saw a need for some force trained to
maintain public order.
   ``We assume at the same time these are indispensible troops
because some danger for social peace and order will remain at a
large scale that will have to be approached with mobilized
troops,'' Garstka said. ``I am talking ... about various big
events, first of all sports events.''
   According to the Interior Ministry budget published in early
September by the liberal Communist weekly Polityka, there were
12,819 positions in the ZOMO department, not counting part-time
employees and others assigned temporarily, including those doing
mandatory military service. The International Institute for
Strategic Studies put the number of ZOMO at 28,000.
   The ZOMO, which stands in Polish for Motorized Units of the
Citizens Militia, had been used most to disband anti-Communist
demonstrations during the years the government tried to suppress
Solidarity and other opposition groups following martial law on
Dec. 13, 1981.
   The squads would spill out of armored trucks and double-step in
ranks, the officers hidden behind helmets with face guards and
large shields. Alerts of ``ZOMO ZOMO'' would turn heads of
protesters and onlookers, and send tension through a crowd as the
troops moved forward to force marchers into retreat.
   The ZOMO have been controlled by Kiszczak during his eight years
as interior minister, a post he retained in the new government
after stepping down as prime minister in August following a futile
three-week effort to form a Communist-led government.
   He was the chief negotiater for the Communist authorities during
spring ``round-table'' talks on political and economic reform that
led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status April 17,
largely democratic elections in June and eventually the creation of
a Solidarity-led government.

   Some men are reluctant to admit they read books
by women writers and criticize their work as being less universal
than men's, authors told the PEN international writers association.
   ``Writing by men is supposed to be more accessible to the human
race,'' novelist Margaret Atwood said about what she sees as the
prevailing belief.
   ``You don't stop being defensive until you stop being
attacked,'' she said during a panel discussion Thursday.
   Atwood, perhaps Canada's best known writer for such best-sellers
as ``The Handmaid's Tale'' and ``Cat's Eye,'' was one of the most
prominent critics of the association's 1986 congress in New York
for not including enough women.
   The Canadian meeting in Montreal, and earlier in the week in
Toronto, is the first in North America since 1986. Organizers made
an effort to include more women, ethnic and minority writers in its
discussions.
   Atwood suggested the question might better be examined from the
other angle.
   ``Why don't I like Louis L'Amour Westerns?'' she asked.
   In one of the livelier sessions, Atwood joked that men at book
signings often have told her how much their wives like her work.
   ``What is it that this phrase conceals?'' she said.
   Atwood said either the men aren't reading her books or they
don't want to admit it, possibly for fear of being considered wimps.
   ``Although I can report from book signings that more and more
men are saying, `This book is for me,''' she said.
   PEN has some 11,000 members in more than 90 chapters worldwide
organized along language lines. It pays special attention to
freeing writers from prison, and to censorship and other threats to
freedom of expression.
   The congress is being held in Canada for the first time since
PEN's founding in 1921. The English-speaking Canadian chapter
hosted the first portion in Toronto and the French-speaking chapter
is hosting the last days in Montreal.
   Betty Friedan, the American author and feminist, suggested at
the panel on feminine literature that women must stop being so
defensive about the female experience.
   ``Is war more universal than childbirth?'' she asked. ``Maybe it
is as universal.''
   At an earlier panel on the writer and the exercise of freedom,
Friedan said threats to freedom of expression exist in democracies
even if they may be more subtle than in authoritarian nations.
   ``I can tell you this from my personal experience as a writer
and a woman of the last 25 years,'' she said.
   Friedan noted the difficulties of getting ideas other than the
prevailing view published or being exposed in the mass media
subject to marketplace pressures.
   ``There are ways that our freedom is being continuously
coopted,'' she said. ``And we collude in this.''
   She said the idea of the ``new traditionalism'' that women want
just their husband, children and home seems to be appearing more
frequently in the mass media.
   ``It's something to watch,'' Friedan said.

   A girl has been abducted and the captors
have threatened to harm her if authorities don't act quickly on a
ransom demand, FBI officials say.
   Paul Schumacher, FBI public affairs officer, said late Thursday
investigators have made contact with the kidnappers.
   ``There has been contact to the point that we know that it's a
kidnapping and not a parental thing,'' Schumacher said. ``It
appears that it's legitimate.''
   FBI agent Jon Wendt would not reveal details about the victim's
age or identity, nor about the kidnappers and the ransom amount.
The FBI said the girl was from Burlington, a southeastern Wisconsin
community of 8,400 people.
   The FBI was summoned by Burlington police, who said the girl
disappeared Wednesday. Schumacher said authorities don't know the
girl's whereabouts or her condition.
   ``There have been threats on the victim if things aren't
followed,'' Schumacher said. ``We don't know what their assumptions
are, what they're planning to do next. We're hopeful. We just don't
know how long it's going to go.''
   A description of a car was transmitted to other nearby law
enforcement agencies. In neighboring Walworth County, a deputy
sheriff said there was an investigation involving ``the little
girl,'' but would not speak further.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's archbishop of Canterbury arrived in Rome
today for four days of talks with Pope John Paul II on uniting the
Anglican and Roman Catholic churches, divided since the 16th
century Reformation.
   Archbishop Robert Runcie was greeted on arrival at Leonardo da
Vinci airport by top Vatican officials, including Cardinal Johannes
Willebrands, president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting
Christian Unity.
   In a brief statement, Runcie said his talks likely would be
``frank'' but he was confident they would lead to increased
understanding.
   Earlier, about 20 protesters at London's Heathrow airport
carried signs such as ``Runcie resign'' and ``no to papal talks''
as the archbishop departed. Runcie refused to speak to the group.
   Runcie's secretary for ecumenical affairs, Canon Christopher
Hill, said earlier he did not expect immediate union of the
churches because, ``talks about closer relations have been going
steadily on for 30 years.''
   ``I am sure it will happen eventually because the founder of
Christianity wanted one church,'' he said.
   Anglican leaders said they thought unity between Anglicans and
Catholics would not come until the 21st century.
   ``It will happen, eventually,'' Cardinal Basil Hume, Archbishop
of Westminster and leader of Catholics in England and Wales, said
in an interview with Channel 4 television late Thursday.
   Runcie and John Paul have met four times, but this is Runcie's
first official visit to Rome as spiritual head of the state Church
of England. He is also the leader of 70 million Anglicans
worldwide, including 2.5 million U.S. Episcopalians.
   The pope leads 850 million Roman Catholics.
   In Rome, Runcie is expected to discuss the nature of the
Anglican Communion and explain how its system of dispersed
authority gives a measure of equality among church leaders.
   The Anglican church does not have the Vatican's central
directing authority, although its priests look to Canterbury for
guidance.
   The Anglican freedom allows members such as the U.S.
Episcopalians to ordain woman priests and, this year in the Boston
diocese, the first Anglican woman bishop.
   ``There's no doubt about it, and the pope himself has said so,
that the ordination of women and especially the consecration of a
woman as bishop, constitute very considerable difficulties for us
and also the Orthodox church,'' Hume said.
   Anglicans and Catholics have discussed for many years how their
churches might draw closer together.
   Runcie caused a stir last week by telling an Italian journalist
that the Church of England might recognize papal authority in a
united church, a view that had already been stated by the
commission.
   Evangelicals in the Church of England, who base their teaching
strictly on the Bible and oppose unity with Rome, reacted
indignantly.
   Their chief spokesman, the Rev. David Samuel, said, ``Many
people in the Church of England don't want closer ties with the
Church of Rome. Already, people are leaving the Church of England
because of the Catholicizing tendencies.''
   Runcie said on British Broadcasting Corp. television Thursday he
was looking forward to the visit.
   ``One thing which is at the center of my thoughts and I believe
at the center of his (the pope's), is that we do have a unity
already,'' he said. ``We don't have perfect unity, but there is
something we have and sometimes people forget that.''
   Runcie is returning the pope's 1982 visit to Canterbury
Cathedral, the Anglican mother church and the seat of the first
archbishop, Augustine, who arrived in England from Rome in 597.
   Runcie and the pope also met in Accra, Ghana, in 1980 and in
Bombay, India, in 1986. They met again later in that year in
Assisi, Italy when John Paul invited leaders of world religions to
pray for peace in the city, which is the birthplace of St. Francis.
   The first visit to Rome by an archbishop of Canterbury since the
Reformation was paid by the late Geoffrey Fisher, who met Pope John
XXIII on Dec. 2, 1960. The Vatican regarded the meeting as so
sensitive that it barred photographers.
   Pope Paul VI saw Michael Ramsey in 1966 and Donald Coggan in
1977.
   Britain's King Henry VIII separated the English from the
Catholic Church when the Vatican refused to annul his marriage with
Katherine of Aragon. The 1534 Act of Supremacy acknowledged the
king as ``the only supreme head on Earth of the Church of England.''

<TEXT>
   Soldiers and police were on alert
today and panic-selling hit the country's stock exchanges after
President Corazon Aquino banned the burial of Ferdinand Marcos in
the Philippines.
   There was little sign of tension, however. About 300 Marcos
supporters staged a vigil in front of the armed forces headquarters
at suburban Quezon City in the only rally reported today.
   Mrs. Aquino ordered Philippine flags flown at half-staff until
Sunday on government buildings in respect for the 72-year-old
former president, who died Thursday in Hawaii.
   But Mrs. Aquino ruled out allowing either Marcos' remains or
members of his immediate family to return now because it ``could
lead to some destabilization activities.'' A senior official had
suggested the government might allow Marcos' ashes to be flown to
the Philippines, but Mrs. Aquino said later that was not under
consideration.
   In Honolulu, Marcos' wife, Imelda, called Mrs. Aquino's decision
``so cruel, so inhuman and so immoral.''
   Also today, a senior official said Marcos' death may encourage
former associates to help efforts to recover the fortune allegedly
stolen from the government during the late president's rule.
   Security was reinforced today at all radio and television
stations, electric power plants, telephone exchanges and other
essential installations in the Manila area.
   Marcos' supporters planned rallies and Roman Catholic Masses in
Manila and other cities. But military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de
Villa said the situation was calm nationwide and, ``We have not
seen anything that is abnormal in the country.''
   Marcos supporters, including former Cabinet members, met to plan
strategy but did not comment later.
   Marcos loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed
attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power on Feb. 25,
1986, after a civilian-military uprising ended Marcos' 20-year rule.
   But rallies by Marcos followers have dwindled steadily over the
past three years. Most of the recent crowds have numbered only a
few hundred.
   At a news conference today, Mrs. Aquino said the return of
Marcos' remains might trigger clashes between pro-and-anti-Marcos
groups. She said officials could lift the ban if conditions in the
nation improve but gave no timetable.
   ``We believe that allowing the remains of the late president to
be brought back here would cause some instability and would
discourage very much investors and tourists from coming here, plus
also dividing the people,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino said recent opinion polls by the government showed
public almost equally divided on the issue of Marcos' burial.
   ``For my part, I have forgiven Mr. Marcos,'' she said. ``But it
is not just a question of forgiving. As president of the
Philippines, it is my duty to see to it that the security and
welfare of the Filipino people is assured.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the Federal Aviation Administration would seek to prevent any
flight from carrying Marcos' body from the United States to the
Philippines.
   Following a meeting today of the Cabinet Crisis Committee,
National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the government may send
a representative to the funeral if Marcos is buried in Hawaii.
   Asked if the government was offering the return of Marcos' ashes
as one official had indicated, Mrs. Aquino said, ``No, there is
absolutely no truth to that. I did not even discuss the matter of
his cremation.''
   Share prices fell today in early trading on the Manila and
Makati stock exchanges as retail investors feared Marcos' death
would enrage his followers and stir up trouble for the government.
   The Manila Composite Stock Index of 25 selected issues dropped
16.27 points to 1,131.67, down 1.4 percent from Thursday's close.
But prices began recovering in later trading, brokers said.
   The Philippine government says Marcos and his associates
embezzled up to $10 billion before he was ousted. But efforts to
recover any money have been delayed by legal problems, both here
and in Switzerland, where the bulk is believed stashed.
   ``We believe that there are cronies who were prevented from
cooperating with us because of...fear of the president to whom they
owe so much,'' said Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential
Commission on Good Government. ``But now, for the sake of the
nation...I believe they would voluntarily come to us and tell us
the truth,'' he said.

   A man convicted in the grisly
killing of a schoolteacher was executed today despite last minute
appeals by the United Nations and human rights lawyers in this
country.
   In Cape Town, a prosecutor said two white police riot squad
members will be charged with assaulting anti-apartheid protesters
as a result of allegations of brutality made by a dissident
mixed-race officer.
   The Justice Department said Mangena Jeffrey Boesman, 36, was
hanged along with a mixed-race man sentenced in a separate killing.
   Boesman, a black member of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement, was convicted of the 1985 killing of
Mellina Fass, a black teacher who apparently defied a school
boycott called by anti-apartheid activists.
   Mrs. Fass, who was in her 50s, had a gasoline-soaked tire placed
around her neck and set alight.
   In nationwide unrest from 1984 to 1986, militant anti-apartheid
activists used the ``necklace'' to kill dozens of people they
considered collaborators with the white government.
   The U.N. General Assembly, by a vote of 149-0 Thursday, called
on South Africa to commute the death sentence of Boesman and all
other ``political prisoners.''
   The United States and Britain abstained. U.S. Ambassador Thomas
R. Pickering said Washington did not consider Boesman a political
prisoner.
   ``There can be no circumstances in which a violent murder such
as the one in this case ... could be considered a rightful
political act,'' said Pickering.
   The South African Lawyers for Human Rights, who oppose the death
penalty, said they made unsuccessful appeals to the government
Thursday on behalf of Boesman and the man executed alongside him,
Jacobus Freeman.
   Thirty-nine people have been executed in South Africa this year,
far fewer than in recent years when more than 100 people were
hanged annually. More than 200 people, mostly black men, remain on
death row.
   About 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted this
year and now are serving prison terms.
   In the police case, Neil Rossouw, attorney general for the Cape
Town region, said Maj. Charles Brazelle and Lt. D.J. Ross would
appear in court Tuesday to plead to assault charges stemming from a
Sept. 5 confrontation between police and activists in the
mixed-race township of Mitchell's Plain.
   Rossouw said Thursday he decided to prosecute after
investigating complaints by Lt. Gregory Rockman, who accused riot
squad members of acting like ``wild dogs'' and beating and whipping
protesters and bystanders.
   Rockman went public with his allegations Sept. 6, the day of
segregated parliamentary elections that excluded the black majority.
   He has become a folk hero with many township youths, who
sometimes chant his name at anti-government rallies.
   Activists say 23 people were killed in election day violence
instigated by police in black and mixed-race townships outside Cape
Town.
   Police initially denied responsibility for any deaths. However,
they have opened an investigation and now say 19 people were
killed, including 10 who died in black-on-black factional fighting
and nine in incidents where police may have been involved.
   Rockman said he welcomed the decision to prosecute but called
for a broader investigation into alleged police brutality. He said
the Sept. 5 violence was ``only one of the complaints that I've
got.''
   Rockman, who met with Roussouw Thursday, has called for the
resignation of Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and requested a
meeting with President F.W. de Klerk.

<HEAD>Government Eases Stance On Multiracial Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government for the first
time is willing to take responsibility for multiracial schools,
either by running them directly or funding them, a senior official
said today.
   Most public schools would remain segregated, but the new
approach would benefit families in certain urban neighborhoods that
are in the process of being declared multiracial. Most of these
areas have been integrated for years despite laws mandating
residential segregation.
   Piet Clase, minister of white education, announced the new
policy after a meeting Thursday with a delegation of people trying
to prevent the closure of Johannesburg Girls High School.
Enrollment has declined sharply at the whites-only school, and a
committee of parents, teachers and students has campaigned to save
the facility by opening it to all races.
   Clase said today the government had a responsibility to provide
education in so-called ``free settlement areas'' _ the official
term for neighborhoods that will be designated multiracial.
   He said the committee seeking to save Johannesburg Girls High
School had two options _ it could transform the school into a 100
percent state subsidized private school, or it could apply to have
the school's neighborhood become a free settlement area.
   Mike Ellis, education spokesman for the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party, said Clase's statement represented a ``dramatic
shift in policy.''
   Beeld, a pro-government newspaper, said in an editorial Thursday
that it would make no sense to allow mixed residential areas unless
the government allowed mixed public schools in those areas.
   At present, black, mixed-race and Indian children living in
multiracial areas must either attend private schools or travel long
distances to segregated public schools in outlying townships.

   A car packed with dynamite exploded in
the basement garage of a downtown hotel, damaging or destroying 60
cars and wounding one person, police said. Three other bombs caused
minor damage elsewhere.
   The car bomb exploded Thursday night on the first level of the
garage of the Tequendama hotel, which is owned by the army's
retired officers organization. The hotel was not damaged, and no
one was evacuated.
   The hotel is where many of the U.S. and other foreign television
and radio reporters have been staying while in Bogota to cover a
6-week-old war between the government security forces and drug
traffickers.
   The garage runs under the hotel, a high-rise apartment building
and a shopping complex. The compact car carried 70 pounds of
dynamite, the national police said in an interview.
   One man was hurt slightly by flying glass.
   Another bomb exploded harmlessly Thursday night at a transformer
substation of the government's electric company, the police said.
   The other two bombs exploding Thursday night were in Cali, a
city of 1 million people in western Colombia. One bomb was at a
bank, and the other at a warehouse owned by a bank, national police
said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, among 118 in the
past six weeks that have killed 10 people and wounded 143.
   Government security forces have blamed the bombings on drug
traffickers, who declared war on the government as a result of the
drug crackdown and the pledge to extradite traffickers to the
United States to face drug charges.

   President Bush today toured areas of
South Carolina devastated by Hurricane Hugo, viewing scenes of
flattened buildings and forests and signing a $1.1 billion relief
package for its victims.
   ``I'm here trying to mobilize the resources of the federal
government,'' Bush said, standing in front of a school bus
demolished by a fallen tree in nearby Summerville.
   Bush was shown around the grounds of the Dorchester County
Courthouse _ littered with fallen trees, smashed vehicles and
twisted metal _ by Summerville Mayor Berlin Meyers, who called the
Sept. 21 storm ``the worst storm that ever happened to our state.''
   The president, patting the mayor on the shoulder, said, ``Why am
I here? I'm here to give a little encouragement to a courageous
man.''
   The overcast skies cleared long enough for Bush to take a
15-minute helicopter tour toward the coast, flying low over some of
the hardest hit areas of downtown Charleston.
   At the end of his trip, the president told a small crowd at the
air base, ``You couldn't help be impressed to hear the people say,
`we're going to bounce back.' ''
   Bush, who had been criticized by some officials for not
organizing aid faster, said he was satisfied the federal government
was doing all that could be done. ``To the critics, I say, I
understand ... we want to solve the problem,'' he said.
   In signing the relief bill aboard Air Force One en route from
Washington, Bush said the assistance approved by the Senate on
Thursday was ``imperative to those who are suffering from the
devastating effects of Hurricane Hugo.''
   Bush's 15-minute motorcade to the inland town of Summerville
took him past pine forests filled with trees snapped in half,
mangled road signs, decimated trailer parks and dozens of buildings
with their roofs torn off.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell told the president ``most
people didn't realize how broad this devastation was.''
   He said ``untold millions of dollars in damage'' remained and
that 550,000 people were displaced and that 270,000 were out of
work.
   Bush said the federal relief package ``will help the victims of
Hurricane Hugo rebuild their homes, communities, businesses and
lives.''
   At the same time, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
announced a $1.1 million program from the Justice Department to
help the stricken area beef up its police forces, including paying
overtime and repairing damaged equipment.
   In addition, Fitzwater said the Commerce Department made an
emergency $5 million available to the Labor Department to help
retrain displaced workers and for other programs.
   The emergency relief package provides money for storm-ravaged
areas in North Carolina, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
in addition to South Carolina.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who accompanied the president on
Air Force One, told reporters Bush had given him a $1,000 personal
check from himself and his wife, Barbara, to help the Red Cross in
the relief efforts.
   ``The money will start flowing,'' said Thurmond. Asked if it
would be enough, he said, ``Can't tell. It's certainly a good
start.''
   Bush had been criticized by some local officials and Sen. Ernest
F. Hollings, D-S.C., for not responding faster to the emergency.
Hollings was invited to make the trip with Bush today, but
declined, the White House said.
   ``We need him to understand how deep the human suffering is in
this,'' said Campbell. ``I want him to know that it's a long haul
for us, and it's not a quick fix.''
   The president spent just over two hours in South Carolina,
squeezing in the visit before a previously scheduled late-morning
event in Annapolis, Md.
   Bush was participating in a retirement ceremony at the U.S.
Naval Academy for Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., who is stepping
down as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Oct. 1.
   The president apologized that his visit was so short. ``I
commend the people of South Carolina,'' Bush declared, adding that
he also was proud of the response of hurricane victims in North
Carolina, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   Again mentioning criticism of the pace of the federal response,
Bush said, ``When all the dust is settled and the debris removed,
people are going to understand this was a team effort.''
   ``It does bring out the very best in the men and women of
America,'' the president said, adding, ``the spirit of South
Carolina comes through loud and clear.''
   Bush's South Carolina visit follows by one day a visit to
Charleston by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The 1988 Democratic
presidential contender, visiting shelters housing those displaced
by the storm, urged that Bush ``not just come and visit a house or
two but to come with a plan and resources.''
   A week after the storm slammed into South Carolina's coastline
with 135-mph winds, five Federal Emergency Management Agency
centers were jammed processing applications for emergency federal
disaster relief.
   With the FEMA bureaucracy under heavy criticism from local
officials for moving too slowly, Bush ``wants to make sure FEMA is
committing all of its resources effectively,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the president was increasing from five to nine
the number of FEMA offices in South Carolina to better handle the
crush of applicants for disaster aid. The 200 people staffing
Charleston FEMA centers would be increased by ``as many as it
takes,'' Fitzwater said.
   Hugo has been blamed for 29 deaths in the United States, 18 of
them in South Carolina. The storm also killed at least 33 people in
the Caribbean.
   Some 200,000 utility customers in South Carolina remained
without power Thursday, more than half in the Charleston area.
About 50,000 Charleston-area residents were displaced by the storm,
officials said.
   The $1.1 billion relief package swept through Congress on
Thursday with near-hurricane speed of its own.
   ``There never was this much money,'' said Bill McAda, a FEMA
spokesman. ``But this also may well be the most damaging one
(hurricane) in history.''
   McAda said the legislation would help provide low-cost loans of
up to $10,000 for storm victims who cannot qualify for private
loans.
   During debate on the emergency package, Thurmond told
colleagues: ``I have never seen so much damage in my life. It
looked like there had been a war there.''

<HEAD>Curriculum Commission Would Stress Evolution Teaching</HEAD>

   Evolution theory would be emphasized
more than ever in California science classes under a new state
guideline approved by a blue ribbon panel of educators.
   Thursday's 6-0 vote of the science subcommitteeof the state
Curriculum Commission sent the new teaching guidelines to the full
commission. If the commission approves the guidelines today as
expected, they will go to the state Board of Education for a public
hearing in October and a final vote in November.
   Science teachers and school administrators who attended the
subcommittee hearing were unanimous in congratulating the panel for
the increased emphasis on teaching evolution.
   Unlike past state hearings on evolution, which attracted
standing-room-only crowds of Christian fundamentalists opposed to
the exclusion of creation theory, only one person spoke against the
proposed new science guidelines.
   ``I am a creationist, and I hope creation theory is included,''
said Ellie Hamilton of Ripon.
   The new guidelines for science teachers and local school
administrators, formally known as the state science curriculum
framework, is a detailed policy statement of what should be taught
in California schools and how it should be taught.
   The frameworks don't mandate course content, which is determined
by the state's 1,030 elected local school boards, but they set
standards and goals that historically have been nearly as effective
as mandates.
   Only four pages of the 187-page framework refer to what
subcommittee chairwoman Elizabeth Stage of the University of
California at Berkeley calls ``the controversial topic of
evolution, which is not controversial in the scientific world.''
   The key provision in the science framework is brief, but makes a
pro-evolution statement more strongly than any previous California
education policy guideline has been made:
   ``Evolution is the central organizing theory of biology, and has
fundamental importance in other sciences as well. It is no more
controversial in scientific circles than gravity or electricity.
   ``While recognizing the right of individuals to hold and
practice their own beliefs, teachers must not be pressured by
anyone to distort or suppress science,'' the framework continues,
adding that teachers should feel free to respond, ``Sorry, but
that's not a question for science,'' when students raise the
creation theory.
   ``Such questions should be treated with respect and referred to
family or clergy for further discussion,'' it declares.
   Curriculum Commission Chairman Daniel Chernow of Los Angeles
predicted unanimous commission approval.

<HEAD>Episcopal Bishops Say `Let's Move On' in Issue of Ordaining Women</HEAD>

   Episcopal bishops say they are ready to work
together to preserve church unity by accommodating sharp
differences over the ordination of women.
   In a statement Thursday, 182 members of the House of Bishops
affirmed the ministry of women while calling for pastoral
sensitivity toward those who believe women should not be ordained.
   ``I think there was a real expression in this house for `Let's
move on,''' Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning said. ``I don't
think there was any question about that. I think we are ready to
get on with the mission.''
   The statement welcomed Suffragan Bishop Barbara C. Harris of
Massachusetts, the first female bishop in the worldwide Anglican
Communion, but said those within Anglicanism who oppose the
ordination of women ``hold a recognized theological position.''
   It also called for following the guidelines of an international
church commission that this year urged Anglicans to ``live
together'' despite differences on matters of faith.
   The bishops' statement was sent to Dr. Robert A.K. Runcie,
archbishop of Canterbury and head of the Anglican Communion, who
arrived in Rome today for a four-day official visit with Pope John
Paul II. The meeting is aimed at resolving obstacles to unity
between the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches.
   The statement also will be sent to the primates of the other 26
provinces in the Anglican Communion, Browning said.
   Traditionalist bishops who met in Fort Worth, Texas, in June to
form a ``church within the church'' said they were pleased with the
statement, which came at the end of a six-day meeting.
   ``God's hand is in this,'' said Fort Worth Bishop Clarence C.
Pope. ``What we have done is simply to remove the siege mentality.
Our convictions remain the same, but we've got an atmosphere now in
which I think we can actually go forward together without
compromising our beliefs.''
   The statement expresses the collective belief of the house but
holds no canonical authority. It was shaped in closed sessions in
the city where the denomination was organized in 1789 as the first
free and independent Anglican church outside the British Isles.
   The bishops opted not to issue a pastoral letter, which would
have been required reading in every parish serving the church's 2.5
million members.
   Ms. Harris said her reception at the meeting had been
``overwhelmingly affirmative, even on the part of some who disagree
on the ordination of women.''
   She expressed hope that this would be ``the last time the house
will have to deal with this as a public statement.''

<HEAD>Communist Government Pilot Defects to Afghan Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Afghan air force pilot landed his
Soviet-made fighter jet at Pakistan's border city of Peshawar today
and joined anti-Communist rebels, the guerrillas said.
   A release issued by the U.S.-backed rebel government-in-exile
said the pilot, Major Jalaluddin, was assigned to bomb the
strategic Kabul-to-Jalalabad highway in eastern Afghanistan when he
diverted to Peshawar.
   Jalaluddin, who uses only one name, was stationed at the
Communist government's largest air force base at Bagram, 145 miles
east of Peshawar.
   A rebel commander, Rahim Wardak, said the defection was
pre-arranged, although he refused to give details. Wardak is a
commander with the moderate National Islamic Front of Afghanistan
rebel group. The Pakistan government has custody of the pilot and
the aircraft, said Wardak.
   Pakistan will keep the bomber ``until we can claim it for our
own, now that there is a hope that we will have an air force some
day,'' Wardak said, referring to the rebels' goal of overthrowing
the Kabul government.
   Anti-Communist fighters, headquartered in Pakistan, have been
battling for more than a decade to topple the Soviet-backed Kabul
government.
   Washington is the major backer of the guerrilla fighters, while
Moscow outfits its allies in Kabul.
   After nine years of military intervention in Afghanistan, the
Kremlin withdrew the last of its 103,000 soldiers in February but
promised to continue arming the Kabul government as long as the
United States supplied the rebels.
   About two months ago another Afghan government pilot flew his
SU-22 ground-attack fighter to Peshawar and defected to the rebels.
   The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen, meaning Islamic holy
warriors, also reported the death of a senior Communist army
officer during fighting outside the key city of Jalalabad, 45 miles
east of the Pakistan border.
   Afghanistan's official radio confirmed the officer's death.
Rebels claimed the death occurred last week, but Radio Kabul gave
no date.

   Indian peacekeeping forces battled
Tamil guerrillas in northeastern Sri Lanka, killing five militants
and shattering a 10-day-old cease-fire, military officials said
today.
   Elsewhere, at least 14 people died in ethnic violence this week,
despite a truce the army called in its fight against
anti-government Sinhalese radicals.
   Military officials who requested anonymity said the Indian
soldiers clashed with Tamil guerrillas in the northeastern town of
Mullaitivu on Thursday.
   Five rebels were killed and five wounded, they said. Two Indian
soldiers also were hurt in the first major attack since the
peacekeeping forces called an indefinite cease-fire Sept. 20. Tamil
guerrillas agreed to honor the truce.
   Military officials accused the largest and most militant group,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, of provoking the clash.
   India sent 47,000 soldiers to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to enforce
a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil rebellion. The New Delhi
government has said the remaining 42,000 troops will be gone by
Dec. 31.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, contend they are denied jobs and education by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and military.
   India, which mediated the peace accord, became involved in Sri
Lanka's ethnic problems because 60 million Tamils living in
southern India sympathize with the rebel cause.
   The accord offered the Tamils limited autonomy if they abandon
their demand for an independent homeland in the northeast and
surrender their weapons. The Tamil Tigers rejected the accord and
turned their guns on Indian soldiers.
   The presence of Indian troops also triggered a 2-year-old
violent campaign by Sinhalese radicals, who accused the government
of offering too many concessions to the minority Tamils and
compromising the country's sovereignty by inviting foreign troops
to Sri Lankan soil.

   The head of a Methodist college invited
an artist to exhibit a painting that the mayor had called unfit for
children when he banned it from a museum.
   ``I will encourage (the artist) to find a place and time on
campus to show this painting in relation to all of his paintings,''
Allen Jackson, president of Huntingdon College, said Thursday.
   The artist, Dennis Sears, is director of the college's art
department.
   Mayor Emory Folmar had the painting, called ``Television
Envangelism,'' removed Monday from the city's Armory Learning Arts
Center gallery after three people complained that it was ``vulgar
and offensive,'' according to Jim Buckalew, an assistant to the
mayor.
   The painting, part of an exhibit by Sears, depicts a clothed
woman bathed in light similar to that cast by a television screen.
The woman's hands are on her breast and groin. A shadowy figure in
the background stands beneath a printed passage from the Song of
Solomon.
   Jackson, who has not seen the work, said the campus may be a
more appropriate setting for the work than the city-owned gallery.
The president said he is proud of Sears as a faculty member.
   ``He has been here since 1983 and ... done a great job in
building the art department,'' said Jackson, whose college is
affiliated with the United Methodist Church.
   Sears said he has received a lot of support since the painting
was removed, including a Montgomery gallery that expressed
interesting in exhibiting the work.
   Allan Swafford of the Green Garden Gallery, which wants to show
the painting, said, ``I don't feel in the least offended by it. I
am far more offended by what was done to it.''

   About 100 students protesting Beijing's
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement clashed with police today
outside an official reception for China's National Day, and seven
policemen were injured, police said.
   The violence flared when police blocked the protesters from
getting near the restaurant where the reception marking China's
40th anniversary was being held. The demonstrators marched to the
site from a nearby park.
   A police spokesman said the seven policemen were only slightly
injured and that four protesters were arrested.
   The protesters, braving a pouring rain, waved photographs of
Beijing residents killed when the People's Liberation Army shot its
way into the Chinese capital June 3-4 to remove pro-democracy
students from Tiananmen Square.
   ``Don't you remember what the Beijing government did to its
people on June 4?'' the protesters shouted at guests as they left
the reception, which was hosted by the official Xinhua News Agency,
China's de facto diplomatic presence in this British colony.
   The demonstrators chanted ``We won't forget the massacre!'' and
``Oppose the National Day!'' They also sang patriotic Chinese songs.
   The brutal crackdown in Beijing provoked anger and fear in Hong
Kong, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Many of the
territory's 5.7 million people took to the streets in support of
the pro-democracy movement.
   The reception was held two days before the official National
Day. The Hong Kong governor, Sir David Wilson, and the head of the
local Xinhua branch, Xu Jiatun, exchanged toasts.
   Earlier today, two stone ornamental lions outside the Bank of
China building were defaced by red paint in what appeared to be
another protest to mark the National Day. Police said there were no
suspects in the attack.

   The Communist Party leader urged Chinese to
defend socialism and ruled out a multiparty system in a nationally
broadcast speech today marking 40 years of Communist rule.
   Jiang Zemin's speech in the Great Hall of the People opened a
weekend of festivities marking revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung's
Oct. 1, 1949 proclamation of the People's Republic of China after
decades of civil war.
   ``Only socialism can save China,'' Jiang declared in a speech
thick with traditional socialist rhetoric and praise for the
party's crushing of massive, student-led, pro-democracy protests in
June.
   Since then, supporters of liberal change have been purged,
including then-party chief Zhao Ziyang, and hard-line attacks on
capitalism and pluralism, such as Jiang's speech, have become the
norm.
   The capital remains under martial law imposed during the
protests, and public warnings have been issued against any attempt
by disgruntled participants in the spring movement to sabotage the
celebrations.
   In Hong Kong today, 100 students protesting the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement clashed with police outside an official
reception for China's National Day. Seven policemen were injured
and four protesters were arrested, police said.
   Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Many of the
territory's 5.7 million people took to the streets during the
pro-democracy movement to voice their support.
   Jiang said today that ``history has proven the socialist system
has great vigor and vitality. The replacement of capitalism with
socialism is the great historical trend.''
   Calls for a multiparty system, he said, are ``extremely
destructive to our cause and (are) liable to be exploited by a
small handful of reactionaries.'' One cannot oppose socialism and
be patriotic, he said.
   ``People of all nationalities and all party members, especially
leaders, must maintain a high degree of vigilance,'' he said,
referring not to any military threat but to Western liberal ideas
that might undermine the party's power. He reiterated the party's
accusation since June that Western nations seek to stimulate a
``peaceful evolution'' in China away from socialism.
   A return to capitalism, he said, would ``give rise to a
capitalist class by fattening it with the sweat and toil of the
laboring people'' and reduce most Chinese to ``extreme poverty.''
   Jiang stood with his arms firmly planted on each side of the
podium and his head down as he plowed through the 80-minute
midafternoon speech.
   The speech, televised live and immediately reported by the
official Xinhua News Agency, was before an invited audience of more
than 10,000 made up of top party and government leaders, model
workers and soldiers. They applauded briefly 14 times, cued each
time when Jiang raised his voice in a flourish and then paused.
Foreign reporters were not allowed to attend.
   Xinhua later praised Jiang for his ``penetrating analysis'' of
issues facing the party.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, whom Jiang praised as the mainstay
of the party, did not attend the speech, in keeping with his habit
of skipping most public government and party functions.
   But the 85-year-old leader has made several public appearances
in the past month despite reported ill health. Most recently, he
was shown on television Thursday meeting briefly with more than
2,000 party-selected ``model workers.''
   At that gathering, he walked side-by-side with Jiang, apparently
underscoring his desire to promote Jiang as the new party center.
   Small parties and receptions celebrating the 40th anniversary of
Communist rule have been going on all week. Jiang's speech began a
weekend of activities at the Great Hall and adjoining Tiananmen
Square.
   In past years, thousands of ordinary citizens flocked to the
square in central Beijing on National Day to admire special
displays of flowers and colored lights. This year, however, the
square has been under military guard, open only to those with
special permission, ever since the army recaptured it June 3-4 from
the student protesters after a bloody march into Beijing that
killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people.
   Elaborate flower arrangements in the shape of the national flag
and other symbols have been erected in the vast square, and
specially chosen groups will perform dances there over the weekend.
Celebrations will climax with a fireworks display Sunday night.
   Also today, Shanghai students went to a cotton mill to begin a
100-day ``social investigation'' campaign aimed at awakening
pro-democracy students to the realities of Chinese life.
   Xinhua said students from more than 50 universities will send
students to work along with and observe the common people.
   The campaign, organized by the city Higher Education Bureau and
the Shanghai committee of the Communist Youth League, will include
a ``factory day,'' a ``country day'' and a ``military camp day.''

   Congress is racing to get as much of its
spending business finished as possible in time for the new fiscal
year, but once again lawmakers will fall dramatically short of
their goal.
   A handful of spending measures for various agencies advanced in
Congress Thursday. But with fiscal 1990 beginning Sunday and only
one of 13 annual spending bills on President Bush's desk, lawmakers
sent him a stopgap bill to keep the government functioning through
Oct. 25.
   Bush signed the emergency measure today en route to South
Carolina, where he examined destruction caused last week by
Hurricane Hugo. The bill contained $1.1 billion for areas wrecked
by the storm's winds and waves.
   Congressional leaders had been saying _ until the last several
days _ that they hoped to complete all 13 spending bills by Oct. 1.
Lawmakers met that deadline last year, the first time they had done
so since 1976.
   The Senate early today adopted a $288 billion military spending
measure for next year that would provide $4.3 billion for Star Wars
programs. The overall bill was adopted 96-2. On the day's crucial
tally, lawmakers voted 53-47 to restore $600 million to Star Wars
they had cut earlier.
   The House provided just $3.1 billion for the missile defense
system. That difference is one of many that House-Senate
negotiators will try thrashing out beginning next week.
   The House, meanwhile, voted 274-137 to adopt a $1.9 billion
compromise bill financing Congress' own operations next year that
reduces mass mailings from six to three annually, but saves them
from virtual elimination.
   Only Tuesday, the House voted 245-137 for a non-binding measure
supporting an almost total end to the free mailings. The $45
million saved was to be spent for treatment and prevention programs
for pregnant drug addicts.
   House-Senate negotiators also are continuing their search for a
compromise to the amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms to ban federal aid
for ``obscene or indecent'' materials, or for a work that
``denigrates'' a person's race, religion, ethnic origin, sex, age
or handicap.
   Helms, R-N.C., lost a round early today when the Senate voted
62-35 against a show of support for his amendment. The chamber had
adopted the provision on a voice vote on July 26.
   Bargainers indicated Thursday they were considering requiring
that a commission study how federal grants are dispersed to art
projects. They were divided over whether a law was needed defining
standards of decency a work should meet to qualify for government
backing.
   One federally funded exhibits recently included photographs
depicting homosexual acts and children in suggestive positions,
while another showed a photograph of a crucifix in urine.

   The Soviet Union dropped an atomic bomb near Red
Army units in 1954 to test the effects of the blast and soldiers'
ability to fight on irradiated ground, a newspaper disclosed today.
   ``After the atomic strike, there were not only no landmarks left
on the terrain, but the area itself became unrecognizable,'' said
the armed forces daily Red Star. ``However, the troops fulfilled
their assigned tasks completely.''
   The newspaper said the bomb was dropped from a plane in the
south Urals. It did not report any casualties, or address the
long-term health problems caused by radiation and how the soldiers
may have been affected.
   In the United States, 100 nuclear tests were conducted above
ground at the Nevada Test Site near Las Vegas prior to 1963, when
President Kennedy signed the treaty banning explosions in the
atmosphere.
   In April 22, 1952, a bomb was dropped from a U.S. airplane and
detonated in the air as news reporters sat on bleachers watching.
The event was seen live on network television. Scores of soldiers
who were assigned to the U.S. test site during the above-ground
explosions have sought compensation from Congress for illnesses
they trace to the testing.
   Red Star said foxholes and fire trenches, many with overhead
covers, and deep underground shelters with double doors were built
for the soldiers, equipment and ammunition involved in the Soviet
exercise.
   The newspaper said the bomb was exploded because of the Cold War
and at a time when NATO forces in Europe were expanding by bringing
West Germany into the defense alliance.
   ``It never occurred to us to question any measure meant to
bolster the army's battleworthiness and the country's defense
capability,'' Red Star said.
   The newspaper's expose was titled ``The Explosion We Can Now
Talk About.'' Although testing of the atomic device was reported by
the official Tass news agency three days after it took place, there
was no mention then that troops were involved.
   At the time, the effects of radiation were the least understood
aspect of atomic weapons, the report said. ``The bomb was exploded
500 meters (yards) above ground, leaving little radioactive
contamination,'' the newspaper said.
   Nikolai Bulganin, who was then Soviet defense minister,
described the test as successful, Red Star said.
   Since 1963, all U.S. nuclear tests have been buried in holes
drilled beneath the Nevada desert or in tunnels carved into
hillsides.

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari urged
closer cooperation with the United States in battling drugs as he
prepared for his first official visit to the United States.
   Mexico ``will continue to fight it because it represents a
threat to national sovereignty,'' Salinas said Thursday night.
   Salinas, who leaves Sunday for a weeklong visit to the United
States, said drug trafficking will be a top issue in his talks with
Bush.
   The U.S. government provides equipment and materials to the
Mexican attorney general's office, which coordinates the anti-drug
campaign and maintains a large force of law enforcement agents,
mainly to stop smuggling of South American cocaine to the United
States.
   Salinas said Mexican agents have seized more than 24 tons of
cocaine this year. He said that represents a significant portion of
U.S. consumption.
   The president said the war on drugs would be more effective if
there were more coordination and a greater exchange of information
with the United States.
   In his talks with Bush, Salinas said he also will press for
expanded markets in the United States for Mexican products such as
textiles and steel.
   Mexico has opened its markets to U.S. products in recent months
and, Salinas said, ``the continuation of this opening of our
markets depends on reciprocity.''
   Salinas said relations between Mexico and the United States are
marked by ``respect and cordiality.''
   He said Mexico could not have renegotiated payments on a large
chunk of its $107.4 billion foreign debt without the support of the
Bush administraton.

   An Amtrak passenger train was blowing its
horn when it slammed into a fire truck at a rural crossing, killing
two firefighters and injuring about 150 people aboard the train,
authorities said today.
   Twelve of 16 cars and both locomotives of the Crescent derailed
in the accident about 7:40 p.m. Thursday about 50 miles southwest
of Washington, D.C, Amtrak spokesman Wick Leatherwood said. The
train was bound from New York to Atlanta and New Orleans.
   ``The train was blowing its horn as it was supposed to,''
Leatherwood said. ``Some people try to beat the train and they
always lose out. We're very saddened by that ... but people just
don't have the perception of the speed and think the train can come
to a quick stop, and it can't, not with that tonnage behind the
train.''
   Sgt. Thomas Wolfe, a spokesman for the Fairfax County Fire and
Rescue Department, who was at the scene today, said it was too
early to say what happened.
   ``That's pure speculation on anyone's part to say what the
driver thought or saw at the time ... it is possible he had sirens
going,'' Wolfe said.
   There were no warning lights or bars at the crossing, which is
not uncommon since it was on private land, state police spokeswoman
Lucy Caldwell said. She said she did not know who owned the land.
   Work crews were clearing the wreckage this morning with a crane
and other heavy equipment. The fire truck was shattered by the
impact, and the biggest piece of the vehicle remained flattened
across the front of the locomotive. It was so mangled that the only
clue that it had been a fire truck was its red color.
   ``I felt us go across one track, and the next thing I know, I
woke up and I was in the hospital,'' said Frankie Herndon, one of
five firefighters aboard the truck.
   Herndon, who was treated at a hospital for minor injuries and
released, said he did not see or hear the train.
   Ms. Caldwell identified the dead firefighters as Mark Miller,
23, and Matt Smith, 22, both of Catlett. Two other firefighters and
seven train passengers were in serious but stable condition today,
hospital officials said.
   Fauquier Sheriff's Deputy R.R. Crawford said 150 or more people
on the train were injured.
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Allan Pollock
said the board sent an investigative team to the scene.
   NTSB spokeswoman Rachel Halterman said the team spent the night
gathering documents and information. ``We're talking to witnesses,
to the crew to see why it happened.''
   The train was carrying 379 passengers and a crew of 20, Amtrak
spokesman John Jacobsen said.
   Rescue personnel formed a human chain to guide the passengers
through brush away from the train.
   Juliet Blair, an American University student from Ossining,
N.Y., said help arrived within minutes and rescuers used ladders to
help people climb down. ``We were really lucky,'' she said.
   An unidentifed resident told WQRA Radio his son saw the
accident. He said it would have been difficult for the truck driver
not to have seen the train because the train had its light on,
visibility was good and the crossing is on a flat, straight stretch
of track.
   Passenger William Roby of Bowie, Md., who was sitting toward the
front of the train, said he heard a ``big thump. ... Then, I could
tell the train came off the tracks. I started bracing myself.''
   ``Luckily the train wasn't going very fast,'' said Roby, who was
traveling with a group to New Orleans to see Sunday's professional
football game between Washington and New Orleans.
   Jacobsen said the speed limit for the train was 79 mph at the
crossing, but he did not know how fast the train was traveling.
   One woman sitting in the front row of Roby's car was hurt when
she flew out of her seat and hit the wall, and others were injured
when their seats broke lose, Roby said.
   The last reported derailment of an Amtrak train was April 6,
when both engines and the first eight cars of an 18-car train
jumped the tracks near Emporia, Va., 50 miles south of Richmond,
causing minor injuries to 34 passengers.
   Amtrak's worst wreck occurred on Jan. 4, 1987, when three
linked-Conrail locomotives slid through a stop sign and into the
path of a 12-car Amtrak passenger train at Chase, Md., killing 16
and injuring 174. The Conrail engineer and brakeman were later
found to have been using marijuana.

<HEAD>School Heads Say They Will Defy Cutback Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State college and university presidents say they
will refuse to comply with a budget-crisis order by the Dukakis
administration to cut 700 positions from the higher education
system.
   ``This is not something that I will do in the middle of a year
where we've already cut $8 million,'' Joseph Duffey, chancellor of
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, told The Boston Globe
Thursday.
   ``There's no way we can do it and be a university when it's
over,'' said William T. Hogan, president of the University of
Lowell. ``I won't do it.''
   The mandate, issued Wednesday, orders UMass to cut an additional
$8 million and about 200 positions, and Lowell to lay off 56 in a
$2.5 million reduction of its $52.6 million budget.
   Franklyn G. Jenifer, chancellor of the Board of Regents of
Higher Education, said he is scheduled to discuss the order Monday
with the man who issued it, Administration and Finance Secretary L.
Edward Lashman.
   ``I've talked to 12 presidents today and they all say they
simply can't do it,'' said UMass President David Knapp, who heads
an association of state college presidents. ``There just isn't a
lot of flexibility at this point.''
   The administration of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis ordered the
elimination of 2,300 state jobs by Jan. 1 as part of a 5 percent
across-the-board budget cut to offset an estimated $340 million
budget shortfall.
   The education cutbacks are intended to reduce administrative
positions, said Charles Baker, a top administration and finance
aide.
   ``Our preference would be that they minimize the impact on
teaching faculty,'' he said.
   ``We'll just lock up their funds,'' Baker said of any college
president who fails to comply. ``We can't have administrators
dictating whether we're going to have a budget deficit.''
   ``We're in the process of dismantling the (educational)
system,'' countered Paul E. Tsongas, chairman of the regents. ``My
question is whether this dismantling is with the consent of the
state as a whole.''
   Roseanne Bacon, president of the Massachusetts Teachers
Association, which represents about 6,000 employees in the higher
education system, said the response to the administration's order
should be: ``Just say no.''

<HEAD>Launch Delayed for Private Rocket in Star Wars Test</HEAD>

   Threatening weather
delayed the launch of a private rocket to test Star Wars
anti-missile sensors and a possible escape vehicle for space
station astronauts.
   The 58-foot-tall American Rocket Co. booster was scheduled for
launch from this coastal military base Thursday at a time when the
Pentagon's Delta Star satellite woul be orbiting overhead in proper
position for the Star Wars experiment.
   But the $2 million launch and 15-minute suborbital flight were
postponed until Saturday because rain, clouds and fog created the
possibility the 33,400-pound rocket could be hit by lightning, said
George Whittinghill, Amroc's marketing director.
   Amroc, based in Camarillo, Calif., billed the planned launch as
the first in the nation using a rocket totally designed and built
with private funds. There have been two other commercial launches
in the United States this year, but both used rockets built with
government money.
   The Amroc booster is intended to release a cloud of inert gas
for a test of missile-detecting sensors aboard the Delta Star
satellite, which was launched from Florida in March.
   Delta Star contains various sensors that some day may be used as
part of a Strategic Defense Initiative system _ nicknamed Star Wars
_ in which satellites would detect incoming enemy nuclear warheads
so they could be destroyed, Defense Department spokesman Maj.
William O'Connell said by phone from the Pentagon.
   The Amroc rocket also was scheduled to deploy an engineering
test model of an 8{-foot-wide ``ParaShield.'' It is a combined heat
shield and parachute that someday might be part of an escape system
to allow space station astronauts to return to Earth, said David
Akin, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Akin's design class built the 390-pound model, which includes a
ParaShield and instruments to monitor its performance, after he
assigned them to design a spacecraft that could be launched on any
existing U.S. space boosters.

   Two women have been charged with lining up
their six children in the home they shared and allowing men to take
their pick for sex, police said.
   Annette Sanford, 34, of South Haven, was charged last week with
four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Carolyn
Wilson, 42, of Bangor, was charged with one count of first-degree
child abuse and four counts of criminal sexual conduct. They are
not accused of sexually abusing the children themselves.
   Investigators say they believe at least seven men visited the
women's house frequently in 1987 and 1988 to choose their victims
from the line-up. They said the children were then sexually
assaulted in their bedrooms.
   ``The kids would just look at each other as if to say `Oh God,
not again,''' Detective Patrick O'Reilly said.
   The women have denied the allegations, police said.
   The women, who are not related, were living together in Otsego
Township, about 30 miles south of Grand Rapids, and each had three
children in the house. Sheriff's Lt. Rick Cain said today that the
six children have a number of different last names, and authorities
have been unable to determine who their biological fathers are. He
said the women have been uncooperative in background checks on them
or the children.
   The children, five girls and one boy, have been living in foster
homes since May 1988, after one of the girls came to school with
bruises and told school officials of the alleged abuse. Five of the
children are 8 to 13 years old; the sixth is a developmentally
disabled 18-year-old girl.
   After interviewing the girl at school, Cain said he petitioned
the Allegan County Probate Court to have the children removed.
   Police didn't seek arrest warrants for the women until two weeks
ago, when they believed the children were prepared to testify. ``We
didn't feel a year ago they were prepared to testify or could
testify,'' Cain said.
   Police said the line-ups occurred at least once a week for at
least a year. The women also allegedly beat the children and forced
them to clean floors with toothbrushes and eat dog food, police
said.
   Authorities were investigating motives for the alleged crimes.
``The assumption would be money or narcotics changed hands,'' Cain
said.
   There is medical evidence to substantiate the children's claims
of sexual abuse, police said. Two of the girls were believed to
have been spared, they added.
   One man, Robert Sterling of Muskegon, has been charged with
second-degree criminal sexual conduct, and police are seeking
others.
   ``They'd select their child and go into a room to have sex. The
kids' stories are consistent and corroborate each other,'' Cain
said.
   The women were being held in the Allegan County jail, Sanford on
$10,000 bond and Wilson on $12,500 bond. A hearing is scheduled
Tuesday in circuit court.

   In the year of the nation's largest oil
spill, Alaskans will receive their second-fattest annual check from
the state's oil wealth savings account.
   This year's ``dividend'' from the $10.5 billion Alaska Permanent
Fund will total $873.16, state officials announced Thursday. That's
more than $46 over what was paid last year.
   Checks will be mailed beginning Oct. 9, more than six months
after the Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Prince William Sound and
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   A family of four will receive $3,492.64.
   Voters created the trust fund in 1976 to save a portion of the
state's oil revenues. The idea was to ensure the state benefits
from its oil wealth long after the oil is gone.
   Since 1982, a portion of the fund's earnings has been given each
year to every Alaska resident who meets the residency requirements,
regardless of age or income. A person must live in the state from
October of the previous year through March to qualify.
   Alaska, with no state sales or income taxes, is the only state
that pays its residents for being residents.
   The largest check _ $1,000 per person _ was given out the first
year. The amount was a flat rate set by the Legislature after the
program was delayed several years by court battles. The amount
being given out this year is the largest since then.
   ``For many families, the annual dividend distribution is
anticipated as a welcome and necessary part of their annual
income,'' state Revenue Commissioner Hugh Malone said in announcing
the 1989 dividend.
   The state estimated 517,693 eligible applicants this year. The
fund's earnings in the year ended June 30 totaled $868 million, up
from $789 million in the prior fiscal year. Of that, $452 million
was made available for dividends.
   The fund's principal cannot be spent. The portion of the
earnings not used for dividends is used to inflation-proof the
principal and boost the earnings reserve account.

   The Senate today embraced a toned-down version
of Sen. Jesse Helms' attempt to ban federal aid for ``obscene''
art, 11 hours after it voted to reject more sweeping restrictions
outright.
   On a 65-31 vote, senators approved a non-binding measure urging
House-Senate negotiators to adopt legislation ending government
assistance for obscene depictions of some sexual and erotic
subjects, but falling short of all the restrictions Helms wanted.
   ``We do know in our hearts that there is such a thing as
obscenity,'' said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., who opposed parts of
Helms' proposal and helped shape the new provision.
   The adopted language evolved when Helms, R-N.C., offered to drop
his insistence that federal aid should be forbidden for art that
``denigrates'' a religion, race, ethnic background, sex or handicap.
   Fowler, despite Helms' opposition, convinced his colleagues to
also drop a prohibition against federal support for ``indecent''
art.
   Helms said dropping the word ``indecent'' would leave ``a
loophole to people who want to continue to abuse'' the use of tax
dollars.
   But opponents indicated that use of ``indecent'' was vague, with
Fowler saying his deletion of the word strengthens the measure.
   Helms, angry that his amendment appeared about to be watered
down, forced the full Senate early today to show its members'
individual preferences for the first time on his measure. In a vote
surprising for its decisiveness, they voted 62-35 against him.
   The tally, which was a non-binding expression of support, was a
reversal of the Senate's decision two months ago to adopt the ban.
Forty-three Democrats and 19 Republicans opposed Helms, while 10
Democrats and 25 Republicans supported him.
   Before the vote, Helms remained insistent that the government
should decide which works of art it will finance.
   ``When they start saying to the Congress of the United States,
`Butt out, just send the money,' this senator says, `No,''' Helms
said.
   But opponents argued the proposal was too far-reaching. Sen.
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., said differences between religions over Jesus
Christ's divinity could be considered offensive and fall under the
law's restrictions.
   ``Depictions in this Bible, in any written work, much less 700
years of Christian art, can be conceived as being deeply offensive
to Jews,'' said Fowler.
   Helms' provision was in a bill that would provide about $11
billion for federal land and cultural programs for fiscal 1990,
which begins Sunday.
   The legislation contained other controversial provisions on
which lawmakers reached compromises on Thursday.
   In one instance, they agreed that studies and other activities
that would precede oil and gas exploration off the California coast
would be delayed for five months next year. The moratorium was
worked out between energy interests and drilling opponents seeking
to protect the environment.
   As has been routine since the early 1980s, the legislation
imposes another one-year moratorium on leasing and drilling in
federal waters off Alaska, much of California, Florida and much of
the Northeast. Drilling opponents say the five-month delay would
help postpone drilling if the moratorium were ever lifted.
   The negotiators also adopted new restrictions on lobbyists who
seek grants and other federal monies for clients. The provisions,
sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., forbid those lobbyists from
being paid with the federal funds they obtain, and requires most of
them to file public reports with Congress.
   They reached no deal on the Helms amendment Thursday, but moved
closer to one.
   Liberals and conservatives agreed a commission should be
established to study how federal arts aid is distributed and
whether standards should be set for works to qualify for government
funds.
   But they disagreed over whether they should enact guidelines
describing which art is suitable for government assistance before
the commission completes its work.
   The National Endowment for the Arts provided $45,000 for two
exhibitions that have created an uproar among conservatives. One
included an Andres Serrano photograph of a crucifix in a bottle of
urine, while the other included photos by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe depicting homosexual activities and children in erotic
poses.
   The Senate passed Helms' amendment on a voice vote July 26 with
only a handful of lawmakers in the chamber. The House legislation
contained no such language.
   The amendment would prohibit the use of federal money to exhibit

   Braniff Inc.'s second attempt to come back from
bankruptcy faces formidible obstacles from major airlines that can
afford frequent-flier programs, huge computer networks and
elaborate marketing schemes, analysts say.
   ``The mega-carriers definitely control the game now. If you
don't have a true niche, like Southwest or Midway, there's no way
to battle the major airlines on the long-haul routes,'' said Robert
Decker of Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago.
   Braniff, which reported losses of more than $1 million a week
since February, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code at about 2 a.m. Thursday in Orlando,
Fla., where the carrier relocated its headquarters from Dallas in
May.
   Braniff first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1982 and
emerged two years later with hopes of a rebound.
   The carrier also has announced plans to cut its work force to
about 2,000 from 4,791, including 556 pilots and 1,167 airport
personnel. More than half of Braniff's workers are based in Dallas,
Orlando and Kansas City, Mo., its flight hub.
   Braniff ``just ran out of cash,' said Edward Starkman, an
analyst at PaineWebber Inc., which led an investor group that
purchased the carrier last year. ``They had some good ideas and
viable plans. They just were losing money too quickly.''
   Thousands of travelers were left stranded and workers were
stunned when Braniff canceled all flights Wednesday afternoon.
   The airline said it is reducing the number of cities it serves
from 36 to 11: San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix,
Dallas, Chicago, Kansas City, Orlando, New York (La Guardia),
Newark, N.J., and Washington, D.C. (National).
   Braniff also announced it will offer $49 one-way tickets between
any of the 11 cities starting Monday. The fare will be available
through Wednesday.
   The carrier extended the expiration date of issued tickets until
Sept. 27, 1990. Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines, both
subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp., said they will honor most Braniff
tickets.
   At Orlando International Airport, Margie Tomlin found out about
he canceled flights as she tried to get home to Indiana. ``I think
it's outrageous,'' she said.
   Lou Antabades of Grand Prairie, Texas, said at the Dallas-Fort
Worth Airport that he had a premonition of Braniff's troubles when
he bought a ticket for a flight to the Rocky Mountains.
   He remembered the first bankruptcy filing, ``but I said, no,
that won't happen again.''
   Capt. Dick Goduti, vice president of the Braniff pilots union,
said the bankruptcy filing was a blow to the airline's 900 pilots.
``We've been down this rocky road before,'' he said.
   Chuck Skinner, a Braniff agent who went through the airline's
first Chapter 11 proceeding in 1982, predicted Braniff would
return, probably as a much smaller carrier.
   ``I am sure we will end up flying out of this one,'' Skinner
said.
   Braniff lost $31.8 million on revenue of $293 million in the
first six months of the year.
   The financial problems largely were caused by Braniff's
relocation to Orlando and its $2 billion order for 50 Airbus A320
aircraft, industry analysts have said. The company recently was
unable to complete a $75 million financing deal.
   William McGee, Braniff's president and chief executive officer,
said Braniff will not cancel its Airbus order and will retain its
options for 50 more. In May, McGee announced plans to expand the
work force by 35 percent and build maintenance facilities in
Orlando and Kansas City.
   ``They were losing money. The writing was on the wall, but
sometimes you choose not to read the writing,'' said Nicholas
Glaskowsky, a professor and airline industry expert at the
University of Miami. ``I've seen it happen at other companies in
trouble. People don't want to believe the worst. You know what they
say: hope springs eternal.''
   Howard D. Putnam, Braniff's former chief executive who piloted
the carrier through bankruptcy proceedings the last time, agreed.
   ``You could see it coming,'' Putnam said in an interview. ``They
took on a lot of debt. They began a gigantic expansion in Kansas
City, and they began to lose money. They had been known as a
low-fare airline and became a high-fare airline. They got out of
their niche.''
   Braniff tried to build up its Kansas City hub to capitalize on
the void left by strikebound Eastern, which was losing millions of
dollars a day before filing for Chapter 11 protection on March 9.
Braniff had operated 93 daily departures from Kansas City.

   South Carolinans showed President Bush
roofless buildings, decimated forests and other legacies of Hugo
today, while the president defended his administration's handling
of aid to the storm's victims.
   ``I do know that there's been a critic or two _ that's less than
I would have expected. But to the critics I simply say I
understand. We are trying very hard,'' Bush said at the Charleston
Air Force Base at the end of his two-hour visit.
   Before touching down at Charleston, Bush signed a $1.1 billion
relief package approved by Congress on Thursday. He was greeted on
his arrival by Gov. Carroll Campbell and Charleston Mayor Joseph P.
Riley Jr., the latter of whom had criticized a planned aerial tour
by the president as being too removed from the people.
   However, bad weather forced Bush to travel by motorcade through
Charleston and to Summerville, an inland town 22 miles northwest,
which suffered major utility and timber damage.
   Summerville Mayor Berlin Meyers showed Bush the grounds of the
Dorchester County Courthouse littered with fallen trees, smashed
vehicles and twisted metal.
   The president, patting the mayor on the shoulder, said, ``Why am
I here? I'm here to give a little encouragement to a courageous
man.''
   The weather cleared enough by midmorning for a 15-minute
helicopter tour of the coast.
   Bush told reporters of some chats he had with Summerville
residents.
   ``One thing that touched me very much was a young homeowner
there saying that he had had offers of help from all over this
country,'' Bush said. ``I think it does bring out the very best in
the men and women of America who want to help in a tragedy of this
nature.''
   The president then departed for an engagement in Annapolis, Md.
   Before Bush's arrival, Riley, a Democrat, had complained:
``Airplane rides and helicopter rides are nice but everything is on
the ground. The buildings are on the ground, the people are on the
ground, the stress is on the ground and we need a president who is
on the ground.''
   Riley said it was ``absolutely ridiculous'' that only two
federal disaster claims offices have opened in the Charleston area.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has opened five claims
offices across the state to serve 17 counties that have been
declared disaster areas. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said today the president would increase the number of FEMA offices
in South Carolina to nine.
   There were long lines at those offices Thursday as thousands of
people applied for grants and low-interest loans to help cover
storm losses not covered by insurance.
   An angry Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., also criticized FEMA.
   ``We've got to make sure everything possible has been done at
the Washington level. FEMA is still the bottleneck,'' he said.
   But U.S. Rep. Arthur Ravenel, a Republican whose district
includes Charleston, blamed partisan politics for some of the
criticism.
   ``It's very easy to find fault and point fingers,'' Ravenel
said, adding he believed FEMA was moving as fast as it could to
speed storm relief to the state.
   Meanwhile, an insurance group estimated Thursday that Hugo
caused $2.5 billion in insured losses in the state.
   The preliminary figure, released by the Property Claim Services
Division of the American Insurance Services Group, does not include
uninsured losses, state-insured property, marine and harbor
facilities, aircraft, utility equipment or public property such as
roads and bridges.
   In Washington, Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center, told a Senate subcommittee on environmental protection
today that the damage from Hugo probably will total $2 billion and
``I wouldn't be surprised if it was much more.''
   Charleston residents were somewhat lucky in the path the Sept.
21 storm took, Sheets said, since Hugo's maximum strength struck
just north of the city in the Francis Marion National Forest, where
few people live.
   Meanwhile, aid continued to flood in from around the nation _
shipments included 5,000 cases of baby food, four tons of pet food
and a ton of Mississippi catfish.
   The American Red Cross said it had donated $42 million to aid
hurricane victims in the Caribbean and on the mainland, making it
the largest relief effort in the organization's history.
   Charleston officials have opened a hotline to obtain the
services of contractors and artisans to help rebuild historic
buildings, and artisans from Massachusetts and Illinois have
arrived. About 75 percent of the 3,500 city structures deemed of
historical value were damaged in the storm, city historians said.
   The death toll from Hugo was 29 in the United States, including
18 in South Carolina. The storm is blamed for 33 deaths in the
Caribbean.
   Animals also fell prey to the fury of Hugo's 135 mph winds, The
News and Courier of Charleston reported today.
   The Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, home to a number of
endangered and threatened species, lost an undetermined number of
animals, its visitor's center and dock, according to refuge manager
George R. Garris.
   The storm also swept away 50 years of refuge records, including
nest counts of loggerhead sea turtles, a threatened species.
   On Bull's Island _ part of the refuge _ at least two red wolves
survived, Garris said. Transmitters in the collars of the
endangered wolves show the male and one of his five daughters are
moving around the island. The other four female pups don't appear
to have changed position since before the storm.
   At least 203,000 power customers remain without power, more than
half of those in the Charleston area. Riley said power had been
restored to about 20 percent of the city.
   The Charleston International Airport reopened Thursday. Although
the concourses weren't open because of storm damage, 20 incoming
and outgoing commercial flights used the facility.

   The owner of a Greek tanker that ran
aground and spilled thousands of gallons of heating oil off Newport
in June was fined $500,000 today, and a federal judge ruled the
captain must pay $10,000.
   The captain, Iakovos E. Georgudis, and Ballard Shipping Co. each
pleaded guilty Aug. 16 to one count of violating the federal Clean
Water Act in connection with the June 21 spill of nearly 300,000
gallons of oil at the mouth of Narragansett Bay.
   Ballard, a Liberian company, promised to pay $500,000 to the
state for environmental research and park acquisiton. Georgudis,
who left court without comment, agreed to the $10,000 fine to avoid
jail or probation.
   Each misdemeanor count carried a possible year in jail and fines
of up to double the actual damages. Ballard, as part of a plea
agreement, said it would pay up to $1 million, but with half of
that suspended.
   U.S. District Judge Ernest Torres said he would not jail
Georgudis because the captain had cooperated with investigators and
his actions were ``negligent, as opposed to willful or reckless.''
   ``I think we were right on the mark'' with the plea bargain,
said U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond. ``We're sending a message to
the industry for reform ... and corporate responsiblity.''
   The Coast Guard has estimated cleanup costs at $3 million.
   Ballard's insurance company has guaranteed a total of $3.2
million to the state and federal governments for environmental
damage. It also agreed to reimburse the state $1 million and the
federal government $3.5 million for cleanup costs and to make
$500,000 available for claims by individuals.
   Georgudis, 43, of Athens, Greece, also appeared in state
Superior Court and pleaded no contest to charges of water pollution
and failing to have a harbor pilot on board when the World Prodigy
ran aground on Brenton Reef. He agreed to pay a $500 fine and to
contribute $20,000 to the state victims indemnity fund.
   Georgudis faced up to $20,000 in fines and 13 months in prison
on the state charges.

<TEXT>
   Timing and a little luck helped quash a
smoky fire that caused evacuation of the 101-year-old Texas Capitol
but no injuries and relatively minor damage.
   The fire started Thursday in a basement air-handling unit and
pumped enough smoke up air vents to fill the two-story-tall House
chamber with a foul-smelling haze.
   But firefighters, who arrived 90 seconds after the first call,
cleared the building and extinguished the three-alarm fire within
an hour.
   ``We were lucky that the fire was detected early, it was during
daytime hours and people were in the Capitol'' to report it, said
Lt. Scott Reynolds of the Austin Fire Department.
   That contrasted with an early morning blaze in February 1983
that gutted parts of the Senate wing of the historic building and
nearly claimed the entire structure.
   Fire Capt. Jack Floyd said cork insulation in the air-handling
unit caught fire about 4:30 p.m. The cause of the fire is still
under investigation.
   Battalion Chief John Teasdale said he had reports that a work
was being done in the basement and ``there may have been a spark
from a welding torch.'' However, Jesse Williams of the State
Purchasing and General Services Administration, which maintains the
building, said the workers were in another part of the basement.
   Reynolds said today that firefighters had no estimate of the
number of people evacuated or a damage estimate for the building.
   The capitol was closed this morning as officials awaited results
of air monitoring tests to determine if any areas were contaminated
by asbestos. Firefighters had to cut through asbestos to extinguish
the fire.

   English actor Daniel Day-Lewis has made a
powerful addition to film portrayals of the handicapped with his
performance as a victim of cerebral palsy in ``My Left Foot,''
previewed to warm applause at the New York Film Festival.
   Dustin Hoffman (``Rain Man''), Marlon Brando (``The Men'') and
Patty Duke (``The Miracle Worker'') have all won acclaim playing
characters with severe mental or physical disabilities, and
Day-Lewis already has won best actor honors at the Montreal Film
Festival.
   ``My Left Foot'' traces the story of Irish author and painter
Christy Brown, who manages an intense, well-rounded life despite
brain damage, badly impaired speech and the use of only his left
foot. The film's title comes from Brown's first book. Day-Lewis
plays the adult Brown, 13-year-old Hugh O'Conor portrays him as a
child.
   Producer Noel Pearson and director Jim Sheridan were friends of
Brown, who died in 1981 at age 49 after choking on a piece of meat.
   ``I knew Christy Brown for a long time and he didn't consider
himself crippled,'' said Pearson, who recently appeared with
Sheridan at a post-screening news conference. ``He considered
others crippled because they couldn't understand what he was trying
to say.''
   ``Meeting Christy Brown is the equivalent to meeting a large
jumbo jet tearing down the runway without taking off,'' added
Sheridan, making his directorial debut with ``My Left Foot.''
   The 32-year-old Day-Lewis has displayed remarkable range,
portraying a gay punk in ``My Beautiful Launderette,'' a prissy
suitor in ``A Room With a View'' and a seductive physician in ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being.''
   In ``My Left Foot,'' he conveys the frustrations of a brilliant
man struggling for understanding, rolling his eyes and contorting
his face to convey love, humor and despair. Brown was able to write
and paint with his left foot and Day-Lewis practiced daily to
master the same skills.
   ``About 18 months ago, I appeared at a party for `Stars and
Bars,' which Daniel was in,'' Pearson said. ``As the night wore on,
the drinks got thicker and the spirits got better. I talked about
Christy Brown for 20 minutes and Daniel didn't say a word. I
thought I was boring him.''
   But Day-Lewis was interested, and Pearson and Sheridan were so
happy to have him they completed filming in seven weeks to fit the
actor's schedule.
   Brown was one of 22 children _ 13 survived _ and ``My Left
Foot,'' shot mostly in Dublin, used several siblings as extras.
   ``Daniel was afraid they'd see him and say, `That's not
Christy,''' Sheridan said. ``But when they saw the film, they said,
``That's not Daniel Day-Lewis, that was our Christy up there.''
   ``My Left Foot'' will open theatrically Nov. 3, and is being
released by Miramax Films, which also has put out ``sex, lies, and
videotape,'' ``Scandal'' and ``The Thin Blue Line.''

   Police are checking out the checks they
accept as bail a little more closely these days after a
check-forging suspect allegedly stuck them with a bad one.
   ``It's a little embarrassing,'' said Sgt. William Zimmer, a
supervisor at the Police Department's Van Nuys Jail.
   The phony check that landed Dennis John Alston in jail had the
same serial numbers as the one that briefly got him out, county
Deputy District Attorney Bradford Stone said.
   Alston, 32, was charged Wednesday with five counts of felony
forgery, including one count of giving the police a fake cashiers
check to cover his $1,500 bail on the other four counts.
   Authorities said a desk officer didn't notice that the check
Alston allegedly used to get out of jail on Sept. 6 was dated four
days before his arrest.
   Alston was arrested later that day after police took a closer
look at the check.

   The president went ahead Friday with
the appointment of a new Cabinet minister despite outrage over the
minister's comment that only women should be admitted as refugees.
   Raimo Vistbacka, 43, of the small Rural Party, took office as
minister for communications and traffic.
   Vistbacka said in a radio interview Sunday that Finland accepts
too many refugees and added that in principle he thought it a good
idea ``to accept only female refugees.''
   ``We could of course bring in Thai women to be wives for
unmarried Finnish farmers,'' Vistbacka said.
   Prime Minister Harri Holkeri warned the leaders of the Rural
Party to fall in line with the government's refugee policies but
allowed the appointment to stand.
   Social Democratic party secretary Ulpu Iivari said that her
party could not sit in the same government unless the Rural Party
changed its policy on refugees.
   Referring to recent attacks on immigrants' property, Ms. Iivari
said, ``I consider these statements as granting permission to those
who want to throw petrol bombs.''
   Finland's annual refugee quota is 500 and there are currently
about 1,200 refugees in Finland.
   Visbtacka's predecessor resigned.

   Ten men convicted by an Islamic
court of child abuse or murder were beheaded in Saudi Arabia on
Friday, the Interior Ministry announced.
   Six of the criminals had kidnapped minors for burglaries,
highway robberies and ``acts of abuse,'' the statement said without
elaborating. The six, all Saudis, were tried and executed in the
capital, Riyadh.
   The other four convicts killed a man, stole his money and then
murdered an accomplice, the statement said. The men were from Yemen
and were executed in the southwestern part of the kingdom. About 1
million Yemenis live in the kingdom.
   The announcement cited a ruling in the Koran, the holy book of
Islam, that criminals should be beheaded.
   Friday's executions followed the beheading of 16 Kuwaitis last
Thursday. They had been convicted of terrorism in connection with
two bomb attacks in the holy city of Mecca at the height of the
pilgrimage season last July.
   The bomb explosions killed one Pakistani pilgrim and wounded 16.
In recorded confessions aired after their executions, the Kuwaitis,
all Shiite Moslems, claimed they had been trained and equipped in
Kuwait by Iranian officials.
   Iran denied the charge and said the executions were unjustified.
   In Beirut on Friday, about 1,000 supporters of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah chanted ``Death to America, death to the
Saudi clan,'' and vowed to avenge the execution of the 16 Shiites.
   ``May the wrath of Allah fall on the Saudi clan,'' chanted the
demonstrators, who were led by a dozen turbaned clergymen marching
behind huge posters of the late Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   They burned effigies representing President Bush and Saudi King
Fahd.
   A number of Iranians gathered Thursday at the Behesht Zahra
cemetery outside Tehran to mourn the Kuwaitis, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said in a dispatch monitored Friday in Cyprus.

   The Royal Marines Band marched through town
Friday with 22 empty spaces in its formation to honor the band
members killed or wounded in an IRA bomb attack one week ago.
   Thousands of people lined the streets to watch, cheering,
clapping and crying. Some of the injured marines and relatives of
the victims also came. Shops and schools were closed and Union
flags flew everywhere.
   The marines staff band lined up to play as the clock showed 8:23
a.m., the moment on Sept. 22 when an Irish Republican Army bomb
demolished the bandsmen's recreation block, killing 10 men and
injuring 12.
   The band, normally 70 strong, observed a two-minute silence near
the spot where the bomb went off before setting off through Deal,
20 miles north of Dover.
   Security was extremely tight, with armed police on the route.
   ``The sacrifice of our magnificent musicians will not be in
vain,'' said Commandant General of the Royal Marines, Lt. Gen. Sir
Martin Garrod. ``Our fine band service will play on and we will
emerge stronger and more determined than ever before to fight and
destroy this foul and dark force of evil.''
   More than 200 men and women from the barracks took part in the
march. They included about 150 musicians, staff bandsmen in their
familiar blue uniforms and white helmets, and junior bandsmen, some
as young as 16, in their green uniforms.
   Among the marches played was ``Aces High,'' which the band had
practiced just before the bomb exploded.

   President Corazon Aquino said Friday
she has forgiven Ferdinand Marcos for the murder of her husband but
cannot permit the late president to be buried here because it would
trigger domestic unrest.
   The government put troops and police on alert after the
72-year-old former president died Thursday in Honolulu. There were
no major demonstrations by Marcos supporters.
   Leaders of Marcos' New Society Movement met to map strategy for
forcing Mrs. Aquino to allow their former leader to be buried in
his homeland.
   Marcos' supporters will ask the Supreme Court to overturn the
ban, said Nicanor Yniguez, former speaker of the National Assembly
and a prominent pro-Marcos leader.
   ``Can a dead man destabilize a government that always claims to
be stable?'' Yniguez asked.
   Mrs. Aquino said officials would periodically review the ban and
could lift it in the future.
   ``We believe that allowing the remains of the late president to
be brought back here would cause some instability and would
discourage very much investors and tourists from coming here, plus
also dividing the people,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a nationally
televised news conference.
   ``For my part, I have forgiven Mr. Marcos,'' she added. ``But it
is not just a question of forgiving. As president of the
Philippines, it is my duty to see to it that the security and
welfare of the Filipino people is assured.''
   Mrs. Aquino has blamed Marcos for the August 1983 assassination
of her husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., who was shot to death as
he arrived at Manila's airport to end three years of self-imposed
exile in the United States and challenge Marcos' rule.
   Forty people, mostly soldiers, are on trial for the slaying.
   Following the announcement of Marcos' death, military Chief of
Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said the nation was calm and ``we have
not seen anything that is abnormal in the country.''
   Marcos loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed
attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power Feb. 25, 1986,
after a popular uprising ended Marcos' 20-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino, who came to power three years ago in the uprising
that toppled Marcos, ordered Philippine flags flown at half-staff
until Sunday on government buildings.
   She said the government would send a representative to Marcos'
funeral if he is buried in Hawaii. In Honolulu, Marcos' widow,
Imelda, said she would continue efforts to return her husband to
the Philippines.
   Mrs. Marcos called Mrs. Aquino's decision ``so cruel, so inhuman
and so immoral.'' She said there were no immediate plans for burial.
   Marcos' brother, Pacifico, joined family friends and relatives
for a Roman Catholic Mass at a suburban Manila church. Later, about
300 Marcos supporters held a vigil in front of the armed forces
headquarters compound.
   In Marcos' home province of Ilocos Norte, about 200 people
attended a vigil at the Marcos family home in Batac, 230 miles
north of Manila.
   Loyalists planned Masses on Saturday but had no plans for large
demonstrations.
   Mrs. Aquino had refused to let Marcos attend the funeral of his
mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4, 1988, or the burial
of his sister, Elizabeth Keon, who died in December 1986.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body, which has been embalmed several
times, remains in Batac.

   Turkey on Friday banned the import, sale
and distribution of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses,'' a book
denounced by Moslems as blasphemous.
   The government of this predominantly Moslem country gave no
reason why the ban came months after controversy erupted elsewhere
over the book.
   Turkish publishers have not translated or published the book,
fearing possible violent reaction from Moslem fundamentalists.
   In March, the head of Turkey's Religious Affairs Department said
he opposed publication of the book because it contained ``ugly and
insolent slander'' against the prophet Mohammed and his wives.
   Turkish officials deplored the call by the late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the murder of Rushdie, who still
lives in hiding.

<HEAD>Nobel Peace Prize Institute Would Prize Some Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced
next Thursday, and right now Norway's Nobel Institute could use a
little peace.
   ``We don't get anything done because the phone is always
ringing,'' said Kristin Kjellberg, office manager for the institute.
   The winner of the 70th Peace Prize has been decided, but as
usual, the name is kept secret until the formal announcement,
despite a stream of telephone calls from the curious, said Jakop
Svedrup, institute director.
   ``It doesn't do any good...we never tell,'' he said in an
interview.
   The selection committee is not swayed by lobbyists or by
thousands of letters promoting favorites among candidates, this
year numbering 90, Svedrup said.
   Committee chairman Egil Aarvik agreed. ``We look at some
letters, but rise above that kind of influence and look at other
criteria,'' he told The Associated Press.
   The prize, first awarded in 1901, is worth $385,000 this year.
   Most people who lobby the committee seek the prestige of the
prize for their candidate or organization.
   But one man just wanted the cash.
   ``Once a man, who clearly had problems, asked what he could do
to get the prize. He said he hadn't done anything for world peace
but could really use the money,'' said Svedrup.
   ``He offered to split the prize money if I could get him the
prize,'' Svedrup said. The man was never considered.
   Candidates may be nominated by previous laureates, members of
parliaments or political science faculty members of selected
universities.
   When delegations come to campaign for legitimate candidates ``we
listen to what they have to say and bid them farewell. It doesn't
have any effect,'' Svedrup said.
   Letters also clog the institute's austere Oslo office ``but we
don't take them into account,'' he said.
   ``We do spend a lot of time sorting mail,'' said Ms. Kjellberg.
``Many people, some with tragic stories, write asking for the
money. They don't understand the prize.''
   The Nobel laureate is chosen by a five-member committee elected
by the Norwegian Parliament to six-year terms. The institute, which
has five permanent employees, maintains a library and provides the
committee with meeting rooms and research facilities.
   The committee meets six or seven times a year. No notes leave
the room, no list of candidates is made available, and the
committee's deliberations are, by law, kept secret for 50 years.
   Svedrup said secrecy protects candidates, sometimes keeping
details of their activities from their home governments.
   Each year Norway's media try to guess the winner. This year bets
are on Czech human rights activists Jiri Hajak or Vaclav Havel;
imprisoned South African activist Nelson Mandela; Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, or Ronald Reagan.
   ``This year's choice will be criticized ... they always are,''
Svedrup said. The prize will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the
anniversary of the 1896 death of benefactor Alfred Nobel, the
inventor of dynamite.
   Last year the prize went to the U.N. peacekeeping forces. Other
recent winners were Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, South
African Bishop Desmond Tutu, and India's Mother Teresa.
   There have been 19 years in which no prize was awarded.
   Nobel, a Swede, never explained why he picked Norway's
Parliament to award the Peace Prize. The Nobel prizes for
literature, chemistry, and physics are awarded in Sweden and will
be announced in Stockholm later in October.
   Some believe Nobel wished to ease tensions between the
neighboring countries, which were under one crown when he wrote his
will in 1895. The union dissolved in 1905.
   Nobel hoped his 1867 invention of dynamite would prove to be a
powerful weapon that would deter war and bring peace.
   ``My dynamite factories may well put an end to war sooner than
your (peace) conferences,'' he wrote to a friend and peace activist
in 1892. ``The day when two army corps can annihilate one another
in one second, all civilized nations, it is to be hoped, will
recoil from war and discharge their troops.''

   Barred from overflying China, Pope John Paul
II will become the first pontiff to fly over the Soviet Union on
his trip to Asia next month, the Vatican said Friday.
   Alitalia received permission for a route for the papal plane
over Yugoslavia, Hungary, the Soviet Union and Japan for the Oct. 6
flight to Seoul, South Korea, the first stop on the 10-day trip,
said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   The Italian flag airline announced last month that China's
Communist government denied permission for the papal plane to
overfly China. China did not give an explanation.
   China severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957 and
allows worship only under the guise of the Chinese Patriotic
Catholic Church, which consecrates its own bishops.
   Historically poor Soviet-Vatican relations have improved
considerably in the past year, and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is expected to meet with John Paul at the Vatican when he
visits Italy in November.
   By overflying the Soviet Union, Alitalia avoids the longer polar
route.
   After Seoul, the pope will visit Indonesia and Mauritius before
returning to Rome on Oct. 16.

<HEAD>Pet Lobster Seized; Kids Cry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKSVILLE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who is in hot water after being
caught with an oversize lobster says ``Herb'' was a pet and Marine
Patrol officers went too far when they seized the 10-pound
crustacean and made two boys cry.
   James Benenson, a New Yorker and summer resident of this Down
East town, said Friday he would not mind paying the $71.50 fine for
lobster fishing without a license. But he pleaded innocent at
arraignment Thursday.
   ``The reason I'm scrapping about it is that I think it is quite
silly bothering children over a benign act,'' Benenson said.
   He said two officers confiscated Herb earlier this month from
the submersible box where his sons James, 10, and Clement, 8, had
kept it for about seven years.
   ``They cried their eyes out,'' said Benenson. He recalled his
younger son telling him, ``Daddy, police are supposed to help you,
not make you cry.''
   Benenson said he does not know where Herb was taken, ``but we
hope he's not in someone's stomach.''
   Messages left Friday at the Marine Patrol headquarters in
Augusta were not returned immediately. A secretary said no officers
were available at the Ellsworth field office, and referred calls to
Augusta.
   Herb lived on seafood fed by his ``family.''
   ``He loved pogies,'' a fish used for bait and oil, said
Benenson. ``He loved dogfish. He could eat a 3-foot dogfish in less
than a week, and he would eat everything but the teeth.''
   Herb also loved to be scratched while lying on the dock,
preferably with mussel shells _ and that is what ultimately led to
Benenson's citation.
   Officers spotted the lobster earlier this month. Later, two
officers came to Benenson's home and demanded identification so
they could cite him, Benenson said.
   Benenson said he tried to find a new home for Herb at aquariums
but failed, and the officers later confiscated the lobster.
   Technically, Benenson is accused of lobster fishing with the
wooden box his sons used to catch crabs, said Benenson.
   His lawyer, Barry Mills, said he hopes to work out an agreement
with prosecutors ``in as amicable a way as possible.''
   ``On a scale of crime from one to 1,000, this is a one half,''
said Mills.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker testified today
that the fund-raising technique at the heart of his fraud and
conspiracy trial occurred to him in the middle of the night as ``a
vision or a dream.''
   ``I think fund-raising was my most burdensome job,'' Bakker
testified. ``It never left me. You never ever, ever get away from
the pressure that you have to raise funds for next week, next
month, next year.''
   When he left PTL, the budget was $160 million a year, ``which I
think boils down to $3 million a week,'' Bakker said.
   Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, Bakker
described the roots of his PTL ministry in a low voice. At one
point, when he looked at Davis, the lawyer pointed for him to look
directly at the jury.
   Neither his wife, Tammy Faye, nor his two children, were in the
courtroom when Bakker testified.
   After describing his early years as an evangelist, Bakker talked
about his vision to build the 2,400-acre Heritage USA Chrsitian
retreat.
   ``The vision from God was to build a modern Christian campground
where people could worship, attend seminars and workshops,'' Bakker
said.
   As the ministry grew, he said, ``we needed to build. In the
middle of the night I woke up. It was a vision or a dream, I don't
know. God gave me the concept of the Heritage Grand Partner Center
and I began to sketch it.''
   He later described the same event. ``I woke up in the morning
and began to write down the concept of lifetime partnerships. I
brought the concept to my staff and showed it to some vice
presidents and accountants. I asked them if it would work and they
said yes.''
   Bakker is accused of bilking followers of $158 million through
the sale of the $1,000 partnerships, which typically entitled
holders to three nights' lodging a year in PTL hotels near Fort
Mill, S.C.
   Defense attorneys have claimed the partnerships were not sales
transactions and that the money paid for them constituted gifts to
the ministry.
   In their presentation, prosecutors presented several PTL
partners who said they sometimes were turned away when they tried
to use their lodging benefits. Prosecutors contend Bakker oversold
partnerships and diverted $3.7 million of the money to himself.
   Bakker resigned from his ministry in a sex and money scandal in
1987 and is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   Bakker faces 120 years in prison and fines of more than $5
million if found guilty on all the charges.
   Defense attorneys on Thursday continued their parade of
witnesses testifying to Bakker's character. By the end of the day's
court session, at least 72 defense witnesses testified, more than
50 of whom said they continue to have faith in Bakker and described
him as a man of God.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter clashed with defense
attorneys Wednesday over the number of Bakker's witnesses. Potter
said he usually allows only five character witnesses during a
trial, but defense attorney Harold Bender said the witnesses were
satisfied backers important to his case.
   Jurors heard Thursday from satisfied partners.
   Sharon Creech, a school teacher from Rock Hill, S.C., described
her stay at Heritage Grand Hotel as ``the next best thing to being
... close to Jesus.''
   Lola Pinney testified she recently changed her will to leave her
entire estate to the Bakkers.
   Since the defense began its case Sept. 20, defense attorneys
also have shown the jury videotapes of seven PTL programs.

<HEAD>Pen Shop to Close, and With it Another Patch of England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Poole, London's favorite purveyor of pens,
nibs and peacock feathers, is closing shop, and with him goes
another little piece of England.
   Poole is giving up his Drury Lane shop in the heart of London's
theater district, forced out by a rent hike from $9,900 to $32,000
a year.
   It may be inevitable in this age of supermarkets, word
processors and ballpoint pens. But to lovers of tradition and good
service, it is a tragedy. The closing of Philip Poole's is being
recorded wistfully in newspapers and television, and customers are
flocking in to buy up supplies for the lean years ahead.
   Poole, 79, is so well-known in his field that he is nicknamed
His Nibs. For 56 years, he has sold and repaired pens for
cartoonists, artists and practitioners of penmanship. But the store
that bears Poole's name sits on some of the choicest real estate in
London, and a sudden tripling of the rent is not unusual.
   ``Everyone's desperately sorry,'' said Maureen Greenland, the
secretary of the 300-member Writing Equipment Society, which Poole
founded in 1979 and still chairs.
   ``He's one of the old school, with an old-fashioned shop with
reasonable prices and a unique kind of service. He has perfect
background knowledge of the history of writing equipment,'' Ms.
Greenland said.
   With eight weeks to move, Poole is selling the remains of an
inventory of 5,000 fountain pens and 500,000 pen tips. He says his
future plans are uncertain, but he doesn't want to retire.
   Poole's wisps of white hair are held in place by half glasses.
He wears a white coat, and a small white quill pen is embroidered
on his navy blue tie.
   He modestly admits there's no shop quite like Philip Poole's,
where each sale is entered into a spiral notebook and mahogany
drawers holding thousands of tiny pen nibs occupy all available
surfaces.
   ``It's a specialized business,'' said Poole, as he counted a
customer's change from a gray strongbox that serves as the cash
register. ``There's too little turnover for a modern store that
likes quick selling. They'd never be able to stock all of these.
One or two nibs would drive them mad.''
   Music copyist Harold Sim came in and bought 20 nibs. ``I hope
this will tide me over for a few years,'' he said. What will he do
when they run out? ``I don't know.''
   Five peacock feathers remain unsold.
   ``Some people use peacock feathers for drawing, but I can't see
why,'' said Poole. ``One woman told me she liked them because you
can't control their movement. Must be for abstract pictures.''
   Ironically, the store is closing at a time when fountain pens
are enjoying a renaissance. They appeal to the nostalgia market as
well as to business people looking for symbols of solidity in a
throwaway culture.
   ``It's a reaction against computers,'' said Poole, citing a
managing director of a computer firm who came in recently to buy a
pen. ``He told me that if he really wants to get his workers'
attention, he issues a handwritten memo.''
   Ms. Greenland said many of her society's members are tourists
who chanced upon Poole's shop and were so enchanted they paid the
$16 to join.
   ``It's a tragedy really,'' she said. ``He obviously doesn't have
all the time in the world and he should really go on and on. It's
dreadful that he has to leave without any choice.''

<TEXT>
   Support for Ferdinand Marcos has
dwindled steadily since he was ousted in a civilian-military
uprising three years ago, and few believe his followers are strong
enough to topple his successor, Corazon Aquino.
   Still, President Aquino refuses to allow Marcos, who died
Thursday in Hawaii, to be buried here because she said the funeral
might trigger ``destabilization efforts.''
   Her adamant stand reflects a fear among senior officials that
Marcos' well-financed followers can create enough trouble to
discredit the government and frighten off foreign investors needed
to help rebuild the country's debt-ridden economy.
   In a country where public opinion surveys are notoriously
unreliable, it is difficult to determine the extent of support for
Marcos, who ruled this country for 20 years, longer than any
Philippine president.
   But the results of elections held since 1986 _ as well as the
turnout in recent pro-Marcos rallies _ indicate a decline in the
number of hardcore Marcos supporters.
   After the February 1986 uprising that toppled Marcos, the late
president's followers could muster up to 10,000 people for rallies
demanding the return of the man they considered their legitimate
president.
   But in recent months, Marcos loyalists have been able to attract
only a few hundred participants. Many are middle-aged men and women
from Marcos' northern Luzon island stronghold.
   None of the candidates clearly identified as Marcos supporters
won election to the Senate in the May 1987 congressional balloting.
Nineteen avowed pro-Marcos politicians were elected to the
200-member House of Representatives.
   Unlike the 24 senators who were elected in nationwide balloting,
House members were elected by district, indicating scattered
pockets of support for Marcos, particularly in northern Luzon and
parts of Mindanao island.
   Marcos supporters are organized into about 30 different
factions, including the ``Ako'y Pilipino,'' or ``I am a Filipino''
group, and the New Society Movement, the party Marcos organized.
   One source with close ties to the Marcos movement, speaking on
condition of anonymity, estimated that up to a million of the 58
million Filipinos were either members of pro-Marcos groups or
supported them.
   That represents a sizeable political base, and already
politicians are jockeying for control of the movement. Candidates
for the Marcos mantel include Vice President Salvador Laurel, Sen.
Juan Ponce Enrile and Eduardo Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's estranged
cousin who fled to California after Marcos was overthrown.
   Division within the Marcos camp may be in part responsible for
the delay in organizing the protests that were widely anticipated
after Marcos' death.
   After Marcos' ouster, the peak of the loyalist movement was the
June 1986 takeover of the Manila Hotel. Troops loyal to Marcos
seized the hotel and declared the former president's 1986 running
mate, Arturo Tolentino, as acting president.
   The mutineers, who were receiving instructions by telephone from
Marcos, surrendered about 40 hours later. In January 1987,
pro-Marcos troops seized a radio-television station and held out
for about 60 hours before surrendering.
   Afterward, the government claimed Marcos was preparing to leave
Hawaii secretly for Manila in case the coup attempt succeeded.
   The base of Marcos' support is in the Ilocano-speaking areas of
the north, which includes the late president's birthplace, Sarrat,
and the family's ancestral home, Batac.
   Other Marcos strongholds include scattered areas of the central
Visayas islands and Mindanao _ mostly in districts controlled by
warlords with whom the former president forged alliances.
   But the deepest sympathy for Marcos is in the Ilocano regions of
the north. Filipino culture requires special loyalty to members of
one's own linguistic group or province.
   Ilocanos, a strongly clannish group, number about 6 million and
are the third-largest linguistic group in a country where more than
80 languages and dialects are spoken.
   Ilocanos are strongly represented within the Philippine
military. Figures on their numbers are unavailable, but reporters
covering the August 1987 coup attempt, led by renegade Lt. Col.
Gregorio Honasan, heard many of the mutineers speaking Ilocano.

<TEXT>
   The Army suspended the firing of
mortars at Fort Stewart while it determines what caused the
explosion that killed two soldiers handling one of the weapons.
   Officials from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., were
investigating Thursday's accident in Georgia and another accident
the day before at Fort Sill, Okla., where an errant artillery shell
killed three soldiers and wounded 24.
   There was no relationship between the accidents, which involved
different types of weapons, said Lt. Colonel Herbert Blanks, public
affairs officer for the safety center.
   The 4.2-inch mortar that exploded could have been faulty, or one
of the victims might have made an error setting the timing fuse on
the device, said Maj. Donald W. Keeling, a Fort Stewart spokesman.
   ``At this point, we really don't know what happened, but they
were the ones handling the munitions,'' Keeling said.
   A mortar is a short-barreled cannon that can be fired from a
position on the ground or from fittings aboard a vehicle. Its shell
contains shrapnel.
   During training exercises, Keeling said, mortar tubes are loaded
by two-person teams.
   One team member sights the weapon and the other loads the
explosive propellant and drops the round into the muzzle. The
propellant is designed to detonate when the shell hits the bottom
of the mortar tube.
   It was not known at what point the shell exploded in Thursday's
accident.
   At Fort Sill, a four-man team of investigators picked their way
through the accident scene, pulling shrapnel from trees and nearby
buildings and poking at a 2-foot wide, 1-foot deep crater left by
the stray shell.
   Three types of howitzers _ 105mm, 155mm and 8-inch guns _ were
being used in target practice at Fort Sill on Wednesday.
Investigators must determine which gun the shell came from, and
whether the firing error was human or mechanical, said Brig. Gen.
Lou Hennies, director of Army safety for the Army Safety Center.
   ``If it's human, it could be in standards, in training, in
leaders, in individuals or any combination thereof,'' Hennies
said.``We're not in the blaming process ... for punitive measures.
This is preventive.''
   Post officials said the explosion occurred 700 to 1,000 meters
beyond the target site. The shell landed about 10 yards from where
a group of trainees had lined in formation, preparing to move to
their next exercise.
   The army identified those killed by the blast as Pvt. 1 Jimmy N.
McCain, 21, of Troy, Ala.; Pvt. 1 Edward L. Zastrow, 18, of Lester
Prairie, Minn., and Spec. Thomas P. Boyle, 25, of Ventura, Calif.
   Staff Sgt. Scottie Harris of Rockmart, Ga., and Pvt. 1 David
Saltsman of Dayton, Texas, were in critical condition early today,
and Pvts. 1 David Adams of Vinemont, Ala., Troy Emmons of Hubbard,
Neb., Charles McCrossen of Mason, Ohio, and David Mechem of
Wichita, Kan., were in serious condition, officials said.
   Seventeen other soldiers remained hospitalized, 15 in stable
condition and two in good condition. One soldier was released
Thursday, said Col. William Gonzales, commander of the Reynold Army
Hospital. Gonzales said others probably would be released today.
   The dead Fort Stewart soldiers are Pfc. Marvin Edmond, 22, of
Fort Worth, Texas, and Spec. 4 Scott Reynolds, 27, of Graettinger,
Iowa, said another base spokesman, Dean Wohlgemuth.

   A 2{-year-old girl whose abduction was
being investigated by the FBI was freed unharmed today, and the
boyfriend of the child's mother was one of three people taken into
custody, police said.
   The girl was reported missing Wednesday night and FBI officials
had said her captors had threatened to harm her if their ransom
demand was not quickly met.
   The child was found after the 28-year-old boyfriend picked up
the girl's mother and drove her to Madison, said Police Chief Herb
Goldschmidt. Five unmarked police cars followed, he said.
   In Madison, police stopped the car and questioned the driver,
who told them the child was being held at a YWCA in Madison,
Goldschmidt said. Officers then went to the YWCA and found two
other people and the child, he said.
   The child was not harmed and was turned over peacefully, and the
two others surrendered without incident at about 2:15 a.m., he said.
   Goldschmidt told The Milwaukee Journal police do not intend to
file kidnapping charges against the boyfriend, but that he may seek
charges of interference with child custody against the three. He
would not elaborate on the charges.
   The girl and her mother lived in Burlington, a town of 8,400
west of Racine in southeastern Wisconsin. Madison is about 60 miles
northwest of Burlington.
   Goldschmidt told the newspaper it appeared the boyfriend had
been baby-sitting the girl Wednesday night and had taken her
bar-hopping with two other friends.
   The boyfriend's car broke down in Madison and the two friends
stayed with the girl while the boyfriend hitchhiked back to
Burlington, police said.
   None of three people involved admitted placing a ransom call,
police said.
   The child's mother told police Thursday she received a call from
a woman demanding a ransom of $3,000 for the return of her child,
police said.
   The three arrested included a 28-year-old Burlington man, a
27-year-old Williams Bay man and a 20-year-old Rochester woman.
Goldschmidt said the mother knew two of the suspects.
   The boyfriend was being held this morning in Dane County Jail in
Madison while the two others were taken to Burlington police
lockup. The three suspects were to meet with the Racine County
prosecutor this afternoon to discuss charges in the case.
   ``It's not the normal, run-of-the-mill kidnapping situation,''
Goldschmidt said.
   FBI officials said Thursday they had made contact with the
abductors and threats were made that the child would be harmed if a
ransom demand was not made.
   FBI agent Jon Wendt did not immediately return calls to his
Milwaukee office today.
   Goldschmidt said there would be no federal charges.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Lifts Stay in Case of Former CIA Station Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today lifted a
trial stay in the case of a former CIA station chief accused of
lying to investigators looking into the Iran-Contra dealings of
Oliver North.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the Justice
Department did not have standing to intervene in the case over the
objections of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   The panel dismissed the department's appeal, which Walsh had
challenged as amounting to an effort to wrest control of the
Iran-Contra case from his office.
   ``We are, of course, gratified by their decision, and we will
proceed with the case,'' Walsh said in a statement.
   Walsh and the attorney general have been locked in a feud over
how to proceed against Joseph F. Fernandez, a former CIA station
chief in Costa Rica. The dispute, on which the appeals court heard
testimony Aug. 23, involves protecting classified documents.
   The Justice Department is studying whether to appeal further,
said spokesman David Runkel.
   ``We're reviewing the various options, which the department has
at this time,'' Runkel said. The options include seeking a
rehearing of the case by the same three-judge panel, the full 4th
Circuit or going to the Supreme Court, Runkel said.
   In addition, ``there is the option of discussing this with the
independent counsel to see if we could resolve the issue there,''
Runkel said.
   Earlier this year, the Justice Department asked the Supreme
Court to review the same issue after a federal appellate court in
Washington found that the Justice Department could not intervene on
secrecy issues in the trial of North, a former National Security
Council aide.
   But the case before the high court was dropped when the Justice
Department and Walsh resolved their differences, allowing North's
trial to proceed. He was convicted of three charges arising from
his efforts to cover up the Iran-Contra affair.
   Fernandez was charged in April with two counts of obstruction
and two counts of making false statements to the CIA inspector
general's office and the Tower commission. That three-member board
was appointed by then-President Reagan to investigate the diversion
to the Nicaraguan rebels of proceeds from the sales of U.S. arms to
Iran.
   In July, U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria
ruled that Fernandez could disclose, as part of his defense, the
location of several CIA facilities in Latin America and details of
secret CIA programs.
   The Classified Information Procedures Act, passed by Congress in
1980 to address situations in which a criminal defendant threatens
to reveal government secrets during trial, gives the government the
authority to challenge such revelations, the 4th Circuit panel said.
   But Walsh's office wanted to use an affidavit with the trial
court to block disclosure of the classified information. The
Justice Department pressed for a pre-trial appeal of Hilton's
rulings.
   According to the 4th Circuit, the government in this case is the
independent counsel, not the Justice Department.
   An independent prosecutor is not independent if the department
can exercise supervision or intefere with his decisions, the panel
said.
   The pre-trial appeal right is important in limiting judicial
errors that might affect a prosecution's outcome, the panel said.
``Independent counsel must be able to decide when and whether to
use this device,'' the panel said.
   The court said it had to reconcile the Ethics in Government Act,
which allows the use of such counsel to prosecute high-ranking
executive branch officials, and the classified information statute,
neither of which refer to each other.
   The panel also said its decision should be narrowly interpreted
and that the attorney general has other powers closely related to
protecting government secrets, including the right to file an
affidavit prohibiting such disclosures.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Forecast Continued Economic Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday that its chief
forecasting gauge turned up in August for the second straight
month, another sign the nation's economy is likely to grow, albeit
modestly, at least into next year.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators climbed
0.3 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in July and falling
0.1 percent in June.
   The back-to-back July-August advance was consistent with
expectations of many analysts who foresee the current economic
expansion reaching its seventh birthday in December and continuing
into 1990.
   Some had thought the expansion might be curtailed this year by
Federal Reserve efforts to control inflation by tightening credit
and thus slowing the economy. But as inflation responded, the Fed
has eased its grip, permitting the economic growth to continue but
at a slower pace.
   The leading indicators are a mix of 11 forward-looking business
statistics designed to predict economic activity six to nine months
into the future.
   The index has risen four times this year and declined four,
prompting Ysabel Burns McAleer of the American Financial Services
Association to observe: ``This trendless result for 1989 seems
consistent with the slow growth experience of the overall economy.''
   James Annable, chief domestic economist for the First National
Bank of Chicago, said Friday's report shows ``continued growth, but
not robust and not terribly weak.''
   ``It's sort of a middle-of-the-road expansion and that's
consistent with the other data we're getting,'' he said. ``The
notion that the economy is sliding into a recession has been
rejected by the data ... what we're getting is relatively modest
growth.''
   Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser at the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., also forecasts continued economic expansion, but
adds, ``It won't be very buoyant growth.''
   ``I think if we're going to have a recession it probably won't
start before (the expansion's birthday in December) and I still
think we will squeeze through 1990 without one,'' Chimerine said.
   Five of the indicators contributed to the August gain _ an
increase in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and
materials, higher stock prices, an increase in the money supply,
lower initial unemployment claims and increased building permits.
   Six others pointed down _ a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence; lower prices for sensitive materials, indicating slower
demand; a decrease in manufactuers' unfilled orders; fewer orders
for new plants and equipment; faster vendor deliveries, meaning
declining demand; and a shorter work week.
   Annable noted the drop in consumer expectations but said the
decline was from a relatively high level and is expected to rebound.
   ``What we're getting right now is a little mini-consumer boom,''
he said, pointing to recent increase in auto sales and a
turn-around in home sales and related purchases of home-furnishing
goods.
   Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said the August indicators ``show that the economic
slowdown should come to an end in the fourth quarter ... and the
real gross national product should rise throughout 1990.''
   The GNP grew 3.1 percent on an annual basis during the first
half of 1989, but is expected to slow during the second half. The
Bush administration forecasts a 2.9 percent growth rate for the
year, meaning the economy would need to expand only at a 2.3
percent annual rate to meet that goal.

   Fourteen years after a 75-year-old ``bag
lady'' was bludgeoned to death with a stick of firewood in her
one-room shack, police using computerized fingerprints have
arrested a paroled felon.
   Jerry Lindley, 32, of College Park pleaded innocent Thursday to
charges of murder and armed robbery in the 1975 death of Billie
Fultz.
   Retired Detective Jerry Fronebarger, who investigated the case
in 1975, described Mrs. Fultz as an eccentric ``bag lady'' who
lived alone without electricity or indoor plumbing.
   Authorities, meanwhile, have called Lindley's arrest one of the
most dramatic successes of the new fingerprint system since it was
installed at the beginning of this year.
   ``It's the first one of this magnitude of this age _ where the
fingerprint is 14 years old,'' said Thomas J. McGreevy, deputy
director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
   Last week when the police technician who originally worked the
slaying took fingerprints found at the 1975 crime scene to the
GBI's new computer.
   And on Friday the machine matched fingerprints taken when
Lindley entered prison with prints lifted from Mrs. Fultz's cashbox
and a kerosene lantern after the slaying.
   Fronebarger said that in 1975 police manually searched without
success through more than 200 fingerprints for a match to those
found at the scene.
   Yet police said the $6 million Automated Fingerprint
Identification System whizzed out a fingerprint match in just 20
minutes, after starting a check through the 3.75 million prints on
file.
   Fulton County police Sgt. Donald Cook said that on Wednesday,
police arrested Lindley, who had been on parole after pleading
guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 1985 death of his wife,
Libby.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The goodwill resulting from a thaw in
relations between Alaska and the Soviet Union is spreading from
people to dogs.
   Susan Butcher, a three-time winner of the 1,100-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race, was to leave Friday for the Soviet Far East
along with a veterinarian and two Iditarod Trail Committee
officials.
   The group has three goals:
   _ Find two Soviet mushers who would live in Manley with Butcher
and her husband, Dave Monson, another winning musher, and learn the
ropes about sled dog racing, Alaska-style.
   _ Examine sled dogs used in the Soviet Union for size and
stamina comparisons with their Alaska counterparts.
   _ Organize a committee on the Soviet side of the Bering Strait
that would help lay out a route for a new, international sled dog
race which would start in Nome and end in the U.S.S.R., after
contestants had been flown across the strait.
   Ginna Brelsford, with the Alaska Office of International Trade
and a member of the Bering Bridge Expedition which traveled 1,000
miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the Soviet Far East to
Alaska, helped arrange this week-long trip.
   ``All that sounds easy, but it's amazing how much time it takes
to get things done over there,'' Brelsford said of the goals for
Butcher's trip.
   The Soviets are no strangers to using dogs in the Arctic, but
they lag far behind the U.S. in developing racing equipment and
techniques, she said.
   ``When we introduced our sleds, they were excited about how
light and how flexible they were and how easily they could be taken
apart,'' Brelsford said of her trek last spring.
   ``They still operate with heavy leather harnesses and use ivory
hooks to connect things. Their technology is old when it comes to
using dogs and sleds.''
   ``Generally, they use freight animals _ dogs bigger than what
you see running the Iditarod but not necessarily better,''
Brelsford said.
   Monson and Butcher have 120 dogs in their Manley kennel, but
Monson said they always are looking for new bloodlines.
   ``Anything that will improve the general makeup of a sled dog so
it would perform better would be of interest,'' Monson said.
   The new race would be operated separately from the Iditarod,
said Rosemary Phillips, executive director of the race established
in 1973.
   ``We will not be taking anything from the Iditarod Sled Dog Race
to put this on, excepting experience,'' Phillips said. ``We've had
very positive responses from mushers _ lots and lots of calls
wondering how they could enter.''
   The race would be run about the end of March, at least two weeks
after the winner of the Iditarod crosses the finish line in Nome,
she said.
   ``Mushers are a sturdy bunch. You might see much the same teams
in there from the Iditarod.''
   The route would be from Nome to Wales in Alaska. From there,
mushers and dogs would be flown across the Bering Strait for a
restart in Uelen in the U.S.S.R. and the eventual finish at Anadyr,
she said.
   ``We would love to do it in 1990,'' Phillips said.
``Realistically speaking, it probably will be 1991.''
   The group also will be recruiting Soviet mushers and teams for
the Iditarod.
   ``Things like this just serve to break down the barriers,''
Phillips said. ``It's making the world smaller.''

<HEAD>Giuliani Ad Points up Jackson Support of Dinkins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertisement aimed at Jewish voters placed
by mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani showing opponent David
Dinkins with the Rev. Jesse Jackson was called racist by some
Jewish leaders.
   The charges come on top of remarks made earlier in the week by
comedian Jackie Mason, a strong Giuliani backer in the Jewish
community, that were considered racially offensive.
   Mason's role in the Giuliani campaign ended Wednesday after the
Village Voice reported his remarks.
   The ad that rekindled the controversy sends the Jewish community
New Year's greetings for Rosh Hashana and asks New Yorkers to
``choose'' their destiny. The ad was paid for by ``Friends of
Giuliani'' and appeared in The Algemeiner Journal, the nation's
largest Yiddish newspaper.
   The head of the local American Jewish Committee denounced the
ad, calling it ``an ill-disguised appeal to prejudice.''
   But officials with Giuliani's campaign defended it.
   ``This has absolutely nothing to do with race or prejudice,''
said Ken Caruso, Giuliani's deputy campaign manager. ``It has to do
with who are the candidates' political supporters.''
   ``George Bush is strong on Israel and Jesse Jackson is weak on
Israel,'' Caruso said.
   The ad's banner says ``Let the people of New York choose their
own destiny,'' and has photographs of Republican Giuliani with
President Bush and Democrat Dinkins with Jackson, a former
Democratic presidential contender.
   After the primary Sept. 12, when Dinkins beat incumbent Mayor
Edward Koch, Dinkins called Giuliani ``a Reagan Republican.'' That
prompted the former U.S. attorney to call him a ``Jackson
Democrat.''
   ``What they're trying to do now is inject (racism) into the
campaign and that's unfortunate,'' said Haskell Lazere, president
of the New York City chapter of the American Jewish Committee.
   The ad was ``a guilt by association number'' and ``a scare
appeal,'' he said.
   Dinkins said the ads show ``it seems pretty clear what he's
attempting to do.'' He did not elaborate.
   The ad reinforces earlier attempts by the Giuliani campaign to
point out Dinkins' links with Jackson.
   Jackson's disfavor with many Jews goes back to a reference in
1984 to New York as ``Hymietown,'' a remark for which he later
apologized. He also supports Palestinian self-determination and has
received support from Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam.

Parole Commission in Washington.
   Mrs. Pollard's request for early parole was denied earlier this

   Trying to keep up with Mikhail Gorbachev on
flashy arms control proposals is child's play compared to finding
an opening for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   The Bush administration, capitalizing on Soviet concessions that
were brought about by an ailing economy, has drawn about even with
Moscow in proposing formulas to cap the nuclear arms race.
   A treaty to sharply reduce long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines could be ready for signing at next year's summit meeting.
   The two sides are not far apart, either, in their proposals to
reduce troops, tanks and combat aircraft in Europe, and now
chemical weapons, too.
   But when President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III turn to the Middle East they are hip-deep in muddle.
   The Arabs refuse to sign on to an Israeli negotiation plan that
has U.S. support, and the Israeli government is dubious about an
Egyptian variation that Baker thinks might attract other Arabs.
   Bush, in New York, for a foreign policy address last Monday to
the special session of the United Nations General Assembly, held a
meeting with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres on the side.
   Then Baker met Wednesday with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, and
in a three-way session on Thursday with Arens and Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmet Abdel-Meguid.
   ``I believe there may be some potential for progress,'' he told
reporters afterward.
   Bush did not have to sell the Egyptian approach to Peres. It
would have been like preaching to the choir.
   The head of Israel's Labor Party already had accepted some of
the most controversial Egyptian features.
   These include a place at the bargaining table for Palestinians
who were deported during the 22-month rebellion on the Israeli-held
West Bank and in Gaza, and a prior commitment by Israel to
relinquish most or possibly all of the land Egypt and Jordan lost
in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Baker, on the other hand, had no chance of persuading Arens, who
is from the Likud coalition headed by Yitzhak Shamir, that the
Egyptian plan is ``a potential way'' of getting to negotiations.
   In fact, a key aide to Baker, obviously sensitive to Shamir and
Arens' opposition, insisted diplomatically that the 10 points
advanced by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were neither a plan
nor a proposal. He called it a ``vehicle'' for negotiations and
reaffirmed U.S. support for Shamir's plan.
   The idea is not to antagonize Shamir, who has described the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations Mubarak is trying to set up in
Cairo as ``surrender talks.''
   Shamir's plan calls for participation only by Palestinians who
live on the West Bank and Gaza. And he will not commit Israel to
giving up land for peace.
   The negotiations would produce limited self-rule for the
Palestinians. After five years, a new round of talks would explore
a lasting settlement. Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, has met with Mubarak and has accepted the
Egyptian president's formula, which also would freeze further
Jewish settlements in the territories.
   But Mubarak's 10 points have split the Israeli government.
   ``In a government of 24 ministers you are bound to find
differences of opinion,'' Arens said Wednesday after seeing Baker.
   Logically, that is true. Israel is a democracy and there is a
constant clash of conflicting points of view.
   But Arens understated the problem. It is reaching crisis
proportions because it concerns how much Israel should concede in
risky negotiations.
   The Israeli ``inner-Cabinet'' _ the key ministers _ will meet
next Wednesday in Jerusalem to debate Mubarak's proposal.
   This could produce a compromise between the Shamir and Mubarak
formulas. Baker's hope evidently is that the Israelis would be
willing to go the table with their plan and face Palestinians ready
to negotiate on the basis of the Mubarak formula.
   Baker is trying to muddle through, listening and hoping for some
opening to the bargaining table.
   Others have harbored the same hope and failed.

<HEAD>University Teachers Group Says Curran's Rights Denied</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigating panel of the American
Association of University Professors says Catholic University of
America violated the Rev. Charles Curran's academic freedom when it
barred him from teaching theology at the school because of his
views on sexual issues.
   The panel's report, published in the association journal
Academe, says the university also failed to protect its own freedom
and that of its faculty in its actions against Curran, whose
liberal views on abortion, homosexuality and other issues had been
criticized by the Vatican.
   The report said, ``The administration and the board of trustees
for all practical purposes deprived him (Curran) of his tenure
without due process and without adequate cause'' after the Vatican
declared him ``unsuitable'' to teach Catholic theology.
   ``The administration, and particularly the board of trustees,
failed in the case of Professor Curran to exercise their
responsibility to protect the university's autonomy and academic
freedom of the faculty,'' the report of the three-member committee
concluded.
   In late 1986, the Vatican ruled that Curran, who had taught at
the school for 21 years, was ``not eligible nor suitable to teach
Catholic theology.''
   Curran was suspended in January 1987, though he was never fired.
He sued the university, but a District of Columbia judge in
February declined to order his reinstatement as a teacher of
theology at the school.
   He currently teaches at the University of Southern California.
   The university response, which was published with the report,
said that school officials acted properly and that the AAUP
committee ``disregards the distinct character of Catholic theology
and the unique relationship of the university'' to the Vatican.
   ``The Catholic University of America cherishes academic freedom,
but academic freedom is not an absolute,'' the school's reply
said.``Academic freedom may be limited by the religious aims of the
institution, as the committee notes, and by the peculiar norms of
the discipline.
   ``The physicist is not free to ignore the data of the
laboratory. A Catholic theologian is not free to disregard church
teachings, which constitute indispensable data for Catholic
theology.''
   The AAUP committee's report does not constitute a formal censure
of the university, according to association officials. Such an
action could only come from the full AAUP convention in June.
   ``This is by no means cut and dried,'' said Jordan Kurland,
association general secretary. ``There has been keen interest in
this report.''
   Curran, who taught moral theology at Catholic University, has
dissented from church leaders on a range of sexual issues,
expressing the views that contraception and sterilization are not
``intrinsically evil'' and that the church should allow divorce
``in certain circumstances.'' He also has said that under certain
conditions homosexual acts ``in the context of a loving
relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be
objectively and morally acceptable.''

<HEAD>Classic Dutch Artist Frans Hals Gets First Big Show in US</HEAD>

   A Dutch painter who was famous before
Rembrandt, forgotten for centuries and finally a favorite in
American homes gets his first big exhibit outside the Netherlands
at the National Gallery of Art beginning Sunday.
   Frans Hals' ``Laughing Cavalier'' _ a happy 17th century
Dutchman in a huge hat _ looks down from the walls of thousands,
possibly millions, of rooms belonging to families who may not know
the name of Hals. Nobody knows the name of the cavalier.
   It is one of the few Hals masterpieces not in the exhibit.
Seymour Slive, its co-curator, explained that it belongs to the
Wallace Collection in London and can not be loaned.
   Dozens of other museums, from ones in San Diego to the Soviet
Union, did send some of their paintings. Slive saw the Soviet loan
as a sign of the times. The Soviets, who often used to hide their
religious paintings, promptly sent portrayals of St. Matthew and
St. Luke.
   ``Last time I tried to get pictures from the Soviets for a show
in the Netherlands, they arrived the week the show was closing,''
Slive said.
   A professor at Harvard University, Slive is one of the world's
leading authorities on Hals.
   Though the show does not have the ``Laughing Cavalier,'' it does
have ``The Merry Drinker,'' which looks a lot like it and is
reproduced almost as often.
   ``It sells more postcards in the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum than any
painting except Rembrandt's `Night Watch,''' Slive said. ``That's
the best sign of popular appeal.''
   Hals was in his 40s when Rembrandt's first work began to appear.
They lived only a few miles from one another _ Rembrandt in
Amsterdam and Hals in Haarlem _ but there is no indication that
they ever met, and not much record of Hals at all.
   ``Painters aren't writers,'' Slive said. ``All they ever wrote
was, `Give me more time to finish,' and `I need money.'''
   One of the few contemporary accounts of Hals says he drank
himself ``to the gills'' every night, but historians are not sure
that is so.
   Both Rembrandt and Hals are known for their stately portraits,
many of them grouped in the military companies that defended the
young Dutch republic. Hals belonged to one. One he painted is known
as ``The Meager Company'' because its members lack the big bellies
seen in so many others.
   Among the individual portraits is a rare full-length study of a
wealthy and obviously proud Haarlem merchant, Willem van
Heythuysen. A little more is known of him than of Hals _ he wore
red satin underwear.
   ``You can't see it in the portrait _ it's in the inventory of
his property taken after his death,'' Slive explained.
   Hals himself died in poverty in his 80s. He came from a modest
family and his birth date is uncertain, though he is known to have
died in 1666. Two of his last great paintings in the exhibit are
group portraits of the trustees _ men and women in separate
pictures _ who were responsible for a poorhouse.
   The exhibit, financed by a bank holding company, closes Dec. 31
before going to the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

<HEAD>Paper: Soviets Dropped A-Bomb Near Troops in 1954 Radiation Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union dropped an atomic bomb near its
own soldiers 35 years ago to test their ability to fight on ground
contaminated by radiation, the Defense Ministry newspaper disclosed
Friday.
   Although the official Tass news agency reported at the time that
an atomic test had been carried out, there was no mention that
soldiers were involved, said the daily Red Star.
   ``A real atomic bomb was detonated during a Soviet military
exercise on Sept. 14, 1954, in order to study the effects of the
explosion and test troops' ability to negotiate contaminated
terrain,'' it said.
   ``After the atomic strike, there were not only no landmarks left
on the terrain, but the area itself became unrecognizable.''
   Red Star said there were no casualties at the time, but it did
not address possible long-term health problems caused by radiation.
   All Soviet and U.S. nuclear tests have been underground since
1963 when the countries signed a treaty banning atomic explosions
in the atmosphere.
   Prior to the treaty, the United States conducted 100 tests above
ground, and scores of soldiers assigned to the Nevada Test Site
near Las Vegas later sought compensation from Congress for
illnesses they said were caused by the tests.
   Figures on the number of Soviet tests carried out are not
available, and there have been no reports of radiation casualties.
   Red Star said it carried the article, titled ``The Explosion We
Can Now Talk About,'' in response to a reader's query _ a technique
often used by officials to open formerly closed subjects to public
scrutiny.
   The newspaper said the test, in the South Urals Military
District of central Russia, was carried out because of the Cold War
and at a time when NATO forces in Europe were expanding by bringing
West Germany into the defense alliance.
   ``It never occurred to us to question any measure meant to
bolster the army's battle-worthiness and the country's defense
capability,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Full-size foxholes and standard-fire trenches, with overhead
covers in many places, and deep underground shelters with double
doors were built for the forces, equipment and ammunition,'' the
newspaper said.
   Red Star said soldiers were equipped with gas masks, dark
glasses and chemical-resistant clothing, and special
decontamination centers were established near the blast site.
   To limit the spread of radiation and fallout, the bomb was
dropped from an airplane and detonated at an altitude of only 300
to 500 yards, the newspaper said.
   ``Those who were in the shelter during the explosion did not see
it, but they all felt the bomb exploding,'' it said. ``Some of them
said there was a kind of thunder, a deafening sound.''
   Observers emerged from the shelter to see ``a huge cloud,
covering half the sky, pushed from below by scarlet flames,'' the
article said.
   Although no injuries were reported, the article said one soldier
barely escaped blindness and possible death by hurling himself
face-down into a foxhole as the bomb exploded.
   Another, in the open about six miles from ground zero, took
cover behind a mound of earth ``and was only slightly frightened,''
Red Star said.
   Observers ``saw several tanks, among them heavy tanks, close to
the center of the blast. Some of them had melted and others were
pushed into the ground. Others had been hurled dozens of meters and
some were lying upside down,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Everything was covered with stones, soil and dead animals.''
   The test site was chosen because it was virtually unpopulated,
the newspaper reported. Scientists waited for the right wind
conditions to prevent fallout from contaminating any villages
nearby, it said.
   After the blast, Red Star said, there was little radiation.
   Scientists ``noted that Geiger counters did not react,'' the
report said. ``One tank commander thought it was malfunctioning,
but the same thing was happening with other Geiger counters.''
   They concluded that because the bomb was dropped from a
relatively low altitude, radiation was confined to a small area,
the report said.

<TEXT>
   An excommunicated elder of the Mormon
Church's hierarchy and some of its scholars are questioning
leadership and doctrine in a church whose tenets allow little room
for criticism.
   Calls for a priesthood open to women, appointment of younger
leaders and a shedding of the institution's authoritarian image
preceded a departing salvo from the first high church official to
be excommunicated in 46 years.
   ``The pride and the arrogance and love of control is getting to
the point that they are saying they are greater than Isaiah,
Abraham, Isaac and Moses,'' George P. Lee charged of his former
brethren after his Sept. 1 expulsion from The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   Lee will not be present when the church convenes its 159th
Semiannual General Conference on Saturday. But many of the faith's
40000 Navajos will be watching for any response by leaders to
questions raised by Lee, a Navajo, about the role of Indians in the
faith's doctrine.
   Beyond announcing that Lee, a member of the First Quorum of the
Seventy, had been excommunicated for ``apostasy and other conduct
unbecoming a member of the church,'' the governing First Presidency
and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles declined to elaborate, but
reaffirmed their love for Indians.
   Lee, 47, was the only American Indian ever appointed a general
authority, a term defining members of the Seventy, the Twelve and
the three-member presidency headed by President Ezra Taft Benson,
90, a former U.S. agriculture secretary.
   Lee has been on a spiritual retreat for three weeks. He said he
wanted to fast and pray in the manner of his medicine-man father in
order to sort out his future. Before leaving he turned down a
publisher's offer of a $150,000 book advance and declined to
encourage others to take up his cause.
   Lee characterized members of the Twelve as proud and greedy men
who prize power and position over love and charity. He also claimed
they are bent on robbing Indians of what his people believe is
their special standing in Mormon scripture.
   The allegation is a serious one for a rapidly expanding church
that maintains more than 35,000 full-time missionaries and has had
some of its most successful proselyting among Latin American
Indians.
   ``I think the fallout of this may reach south of the border,''
said Ross F. Peterson, co-editor of Dialogue, a scholarly
periodical of Mormon history, belief and literature.
   While acknowledging the vast majority of Mormons felt Lee's
ouster was probably justified, Peterson said many wrote expressing
concern about the fact and manner of his erasure from membership
rolls.
   Mormons on the Navajo Indian Reservation located in parts of
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said church leaders sent from Salt Lake City to soothe alarm over
the Lee affair had tried to muzzle local leaders and managed only
to confuse the doctrinal issues.
   Lee's parting broadside recalled themes raised by Paul James
Toscano, a lawyer and Mormon writer, in a paper delivered in August
at an annual gathering of Mormon scholars and artists.
   Toscano blamed the church's leadership, not its critics, for
fostering contention.
   Toscano said his paper was prompted by April sermons by general
authorities which, in their warnings about ``alternate voices''
within the church, ``sought to inflict upon us a kind of spiritual
lobotomy in order to keep us docile and submissive.''
   Mormons are taught that their leaders from founder Joseph Smith
to the present are divinely inspired prophets whose pronouncements
carry the weight of scripture.
   Edwin B. Firmage, a law professor at the University of Utah and
Mormon scholar, shocked many church members with his suggestion in
June that women be ordained to the priesthood.

   One of two adult red wolves died after
it was released on a Mississippi island as an experiment to try to
revive the endangered species, a National Park Service official
said Friday.
   The wolves, a male and a female, were placed last January on
Horn Island, part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, which is
headquartered near this Florida Panhandle city.
   The female, which gave birth to seven pups May 6, was found dead
by park personnel Wednesday, said Gulf Islands Superintendent Jerry
Eubanks. The cause of death was unknown; a necropsy is scheduled.
   The two federal agencies and the state of Mississippi have been
jointly conducting the experiment to determine whether
captive-raised wolves could adapt to living on their own and breed
in the wild. They hope to relocate offspring from Horn Island to
North Carolina to establish a wild population there.
   The adult male and the pups will remain on the island, which is
accessible only by boat. Park personnel use radio tracking
equipment to monitor the wolves' movements.

   A federal grand jury indicted five men linked to
racist skinhead groups in connection with vandalism at a Jewish
temple and attacks on blacks and Hispanics, authorities said today.
   ``This is our first major frontal assault against skinhead
terrorist activities,'' said Michael Gillett, Dallas County
assistant district attorney.
   James P. Turner, an acting assistant attorney general heading
the Justice Department's civil rights division, announced today
that a grand jury in Dallas handed up the indictment Thursday.
   The charges against five associates of the Dallas-based
Confederate Hammerskins stem from attacks in the summer and fall of
1988. Two of the defendants are still being sought by federal
authorities.
   Federal authorities believe the Hammerskins are a faction of the
skinhead groups that have been identified in racist attacks in
several metropolitan areas around the country.
   The skinhead subculture emerged in London in the 1960s. Segments
of the movement took on Nazi overtones in 1985 and since have been
supported by and associated with the white supremacist Aryan Youth
Movement and White Aryan Resistance.
   ``President Bush and Attorney General (Dick) Thornburgh have
made it clear that prosecutions of this type rank right up there
with the war on drugs,'' Turner said.
   He said the three-count indictment names Sean Christian Tarrant,
Jon Lance Jordan, Michael Lewis Lawrence, Christopher Barry Greer
and Daniel Alvis Wood.
   Wood, who was arrested in the vandalism on Temple Shalom and the
Jewish Community Center in Dallas, was sentenced to 10 years in
prison by a state judge after admitting he sprayed swastikas and
anti-Semitic slogans at the center. He also was fined $5,000.
   Tarrant and Greer also are in custody.
   Barry Kowalski, an attorney with the civil rights division, said
Jordan and Lawrence remained at large.
   He said at least some of the defendants were from the Dallas
area but declined to give hometowns or ages of the others.
   The indictment alleged two separate but related conspiracies to
commit acts of violence, including the vandalism at the Jewish
temple and community center in October 1988, and violence against
blacks and Hispanics at Robert E. Lee Park in August 1988.
   If convicted, all five face 10 years in prison and a $250,000
fine in the two conspiracies, and Lawrence, Jordan and Wood each
face an additional count of using a firearm in a violent crime.
   Kowalski said the park attacks occurred because the skinhead
group believed Robert E. Lee Park was a symbol of white supremacy
that should not have been frequented by non-whites. He said the
defendants attacked blacks and Hispanics and tried to chase them
out of the park.

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Supreme Court today brushed aside
former Gov. Evan Mecham's bid to persuade the court to restore him
to office and to order the state to pay him more than $600,000.
   The court said it had no power to overrule the state Senate and
that even if it did, the violations of which Mecham was convicted
did fall in the category of impeachable offenses.
   The controversial first-term Republican was removed from office
April 4, 1988, when the Arizona State Senate convicted him on civil
impeachment charges he misused money in a state protocol fund and
tried to obstruct an investigation.
   ``Even if this Court had jurisdiction to intervene and prevent
impeachment ... there is almost unanimous agreement that offenses
are impeachable when they `involve serious abuse of official
power,''' the Supreme Court wrote in an unsigned, 5-0 opinion.
   ``This court has no power to substitute its view on these
questions for that of the Senate nor to dictate to the Senate,
either before or after the impeachment trial, the rules and methods
to be followed by the Senate in reaching its conclusions.''
   Mecham was out of his office and unavailable for comment, an
aide said. His attorney scheduled an afternoon news conference and
declined to comment in advance of it.
   During a hearing Sept. 21, Mecham's lawyer told the state
Supreme Court that the protocol fund statute under which Mecham was
convicted was drafted unconstitutionally and that senators were
allowed to vote on the charges without having heard all the
evidence or agreeing on what the exact charges were.
   The state attorney general's office, urging the Supreme Court
not to intervene, argued that senators voted to oust Mecham because
of his general course of conduct and not because of any particular
statute.
   Also, a lawyer for the officer said, impeachment trials are
political in nature and courts have no right to interfere as long
as lawmakers follow the few rules for impeachment set forth in the
Arizona Constitution.

   A Soviet menagerie of monkeys, rats, fish and
insects returned safely to Earth on Friday after a 14-day space
mission that tested the effects of weightlessness and cosmic rays
on living things.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said results of the Bion-9
international mission, which began with a Sept. 15 launch, would
help scientists plan for long manned spaceflights.
   Nearly 80 experiments were carried out, with participation of
scientists from nearly 20 countries, including the United States,
France, Canada and the European Space Agency, Tass said.
   The Kosmos-2044 landing module touched down softly south of the
city of Kustanay in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, 1,000 miles
southeast of Moscow, Tass said.
   The two monkeys, named Zhakonya and Zabiyaka, were to be brought
to Moscow later Friday for a checkup. An initial examination after
landing showed the pair had ``withstood the strains of the mission
well,'' Tass said.
   The deputy director of the Moscow Institute of Medico-Biological
Problems, Yevgeny Ilyin, said during the mission that studies were
made on the impact of short- and long-term weightlessness,
artificial gravitation, ionizing rays and other forms of radiation
on living things, Tass said.
   The results of the monkeys' flight will help specialists
understand more about how organisms adapt to conditions in space
and how to protect humans during short- and long-term spaceflights,
Ilyin was quoted as saying.

   The government on Friday set at $592 the 1990
deductible amount for Medicare insurance coverage of hospital costs.
   That means Medicare will pay for all medically necessary,
inpatient hospital costs next year after a covered beneficiary pays

   The amount, based on hospital costs, is $560 this year.
   With the fate of the Medicare catastrophic illness program in

<HEAD>Bennett's `Probably Gotten the Message': Fitzwater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Education Secretary William
Bennett has ``probably gotten the message'' that President Bush
doesn't share his observation that this week's education-summit
debates were full of ``pap,'' Bush's spokesman said Friday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bennett,
Bush's drug policy control director, had been rebuked by White
House chief of staff John Sununu.
   ``Thanks for your comments, they weren't helpful,'' Fitzwater
quoted Sununu as telling Bennett.
   Bennett had suggested that some of the working sessions among
governors at the summit were full of ``pap and ... stuff that
rhymes with pap.''
   Furthermore, he told reporters, some of the debates at the
two-day conference in Charlottesville, Va., reflected ``a total
absence of any knowledge'' about schools.
   Fitzwater, traveling with Bush on Air Force One to visit areas
stricken by Hurricane Hugo, was asked by reporters if the president
planned to speak to Bennett about the remarks.
   ``I doubt it,'' Fitzwater said. ``Gov. Sununu spoke to him and I
think Bennett's probably gotten the message.''
   Earlier, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, Republican chairman of the
National Governors' Conference, said the consensus among the
governors and administration officials was that ``Mr. Bennett went
overboard'' and ``was somewhat flip in his remarks.''

<HEAD>High-Tech Nylon Nets Snare Idaho Trout During Its Pacific Migration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GALLAGHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Each night, Asian fishing trawlers play out
thousands of miles of invisible monofilament nylon nets in the
mid-Pacific Ocean to snare seafood for Oriental markets.
   But the haul made by illegal ``drift-netters,'' modern-day
ecological pirates, could dictate the future of a species close to
the hearts of Idaho anglers _ steelhead trout.
   The relationship between the oceanic trawlers and the fish
associated with Idaho's effervescent mountain streams is as tangled
as the nets unraveled nightly.
   The environmental group Earthtrust from Hawaii documented about
1,500 drift-net boats operating in the Pacific in 1988. Of those,
30 to 60 boats were illegally taking fish, and even the legal boats
destroy a variety of species caught in their nets, said Wayne
Lewis, who directs drift-net enforcement efforts for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle.
   ``Those pirate ships cover up their names and markings,'' he
said. ``They're crooks; they're going out and stealing fish.''
   The technology that put Japan, South Korea and Taiwan at the
forefront of many international markets is evident in the drift
nets. They hang from floats and catch anything down to about 40
feet. The nets are strong as wire and nearly transparent.
   They are rolled out in the evening and stretch up to 60 miles
per craft. In the morning, they are hauled in and workers pick off
the fish.
   The body count also includes thousands of drowned porpoises, sea
birds, seals and even dead whales, strangled by a plastic noose.
Earthtrust estimates that fish and mammals face a ``curtain of
death'' about 30,000 miles long.
   Even if the snares are cut and set adrift, they continue to pull
in a catch as ``ghost nets,'' and steelhead, the migratory trout
from Idaho's mountain streams, are directly in the drift nets' path.
   The mid-Pacific features a warm flow of water that attracts
fishing boats seeking red squid and other target species. But
steelhead and salmon also are found in pockets of cold water, and
catching them is illegal, said Dexter Pitman, anadromous fish
coordinator for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. Anadromous
refers to fish that go from salt water to fresh water to spawn,
such as salmon, shad and steelhead.
   ``The warm-water species run smack dab into the cold-water
species,'' he said. ``It's hard to set regulations for the pockets
of cold water that are upwelling.''
   Idaho's chinook salmon usually follow the coast to Alaska, while
steelhead migrate to the ocean south of Alaska's Aleutian Islands.
The illegal drift-net boats may stray 400 miles north of the
international boundaries to catch salmon in that area.
   The number of fall steelhead returning to Idaho is up somewhat
from last year because cooler weather has caused them to swim
upriver faster. But the population of fish now plying Idaho waters
is far smaller than in the past, officials say.
   The illegal catches of migratory U.S. and Canadian fish came to
light in 1986-1987 during a crackdown by Lewis' agency on ``fish
laundering'' on the West Coast.
   Tons of salmon were being transferred from Taiwan to Seattle or
San Francisco, then given fraudulent U.S. documentation so they
could be legally shipped to Japan, which has outlawed Taiwanese
imports of high-seas salmon.
   In one breakthrough, NOAA covertly arranged to buy 500 metric
tons of salmon from a Taiwanese merchant, Lewis said. As 140 tons
were being transferred from two Taiwanese fishing boats to a hired
refrigerator ship south of the Aleutians, Coast Guard ships
appeared on the horizon.
   One boat was chased all the way to Taiwan. Of the 140 metric
tons of fish found, 1.4 tons were steelhead, Lewis said. The
merchant was arrested at a bank when he tried to deposit his take.
   Pitman said wrangling between Northwest states and Canadian
provinces over the rights to migratory fish has dissolved in the
face of a greater threat from the drift nets.
   Representatives of the two nations met recently in British
Columbia and agreed to study the problem. A specific analysis of
the drift-netters' effect on salmon and steelhead will be available
by late winter, Pitman said.
   ``We know Idaho steelhead are involved in it,'' he said. ``But
we don't know how much.''
   The United States has concluded three agreements with the
Pacific Rim nations to allow observers on the drift-net boats,
Lewis said. Some already are in place on Japanese craft.
   But arranging observers is difficult. The United States must
gain the permission of the captain or country of origin, and the
pirate ships don't want to be spotted, let alone carry an observer,
Lewis said.
   The technology that produced the drift nets has outstripped the
monitoring efforts to stop them, Pitman said. Conservationists are
worried that robbing the seas of some species could cause a
wholesale collapse of the entire biological chain.
   Said Pitman: ``The ocean, like everything else, has its limits.''

<HEAD>Runcie Begins First Official Visit to Vatican</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Robert Runcie, leader of the
world's 70 million Anglicans, began his first official visit to the
Vatican on Friday by embracing Pope John Paul II and urging greater
unity with the Roman Catholic Church.
   Runcie was following in the footsteps of three previous Anglican
leaders who traveled to the Vatican since 1960 as part of an effort
to reunite the churches that split in the 16th century over the
Vatican's refusal to give King Henry VIII a divorce.
   ``I'm full of hope that we shall be able to build on the
understanding and unity which we already enjoy between the Anglican
and Catholic Church,'' Runcie told reporters on arrival at Rome's
Leonardo da Vinci airport.
   He added, however, that he expected ``straightforward and frank
conversations'' about the relationship between the two churches.
   Runcie, the archbishop of Canterbury, met privately with the
Polish-born pope for 50 minutes Friday evening. The meeting had
been billed by Vatican officials as a simple exchange of greetings,
but it appeared to last longer than expected.
   The religious leaders embraced at the beginning and end of their
talks, according to a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Giovanni D'Ercole.
   After the encounter in the pope's library, the Anglican leader
was the guest of honor at a Vatican reception. In a brief speech,
he praised the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council for emphasizing
respect for other faiths and urging religious unity.
   The Anglican and Roman Catholic churches have made major strides
in recent years on reconciling their teachings on such matters as
salvation and the leadership of the pope. Anglican leaders say they
think the churches will unite in the 21st century.
   However, a major disagreement has developed over the ordination
of women. The Anglican church allows members such as the U.S.
Episcopalians to ordain women priests.
   John Paul, who strongly supports the Catholic Church's policy on
an all-male priesthood, has declared that ordaining women seems to
``effectively block the path to the mutual recognition of
ministries.''
   Both sides said Runcie's four-day trip would probably not yield
dramatic developments but would simply continue the series of
contacts between the churches.
   The Vatican's Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity
noted in a statement that Runcie was paying a return visit for the
pope's historic 1982 trip to Canterbury Cathedral, mother church of
the 27-province Anglican Communion.
   Runcie and John Paul have met previously in Africa, India and
Assisi, Italy, as well as Canterbury. However, Runcie's visit was
his first to Rome as leader of the Anglican church, the world's
largest group of Christians after the estimated 850 million Roman
Catholics.
   The archbishop of Canterbury's visit began amid a mild
controversy caused by Runcie's declaration to an Italian journalist
that the Church of England might recognize papal authority in a
united church.
   The view had already been stated by a Vatican-Anglican
commission that has been discussing unification for many years, but
it drew the fire of Church of England evangelicals who oppose unity
with Rome.

<HEAD>Govt Announces Cease-Fire Extension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Friday it
will extend its unilateral cease-fire with Sinhalese militants by
three days in a bid to curb ethnic violence that has claimed at
least 16,000 lives in six years.
   A three-day cease-fire that started Wednesday was scheduled to
expire at 6 a.m. Saturday, but President Ranasinghe Premadasa met
with opposition leaders and announced it would continue.
   A government communique said Friday that 14 people had been
killed in southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese heartland, since the
cease-fire began. The victims were government supporters or
security personnel.
   The communique also said at least 14 government offices, 10
state-owned buses, seven post offices and a factory had been set on
fire during the same period.
   The Sinhalese-dominated government ordered the three-day
cease-fire, saying it hoped Sinhalese radicals would end their
violence and open peace talks.
   Sinhalese militants have not responded to the call.
   Meanwhile, Indian peacekeeping forces clashed with Tamil
guerrillas in northeastern Sri Lanka, breaking a 10-day-old
cease-fire and killing five militants, military officials said.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the clash between Indian soldiers and Tamil guerrillas took
place Thursday in the northeastern town of Mullaitivu, 120 miles
north of Colombo.
   Five rebels were killed and five others were wounded, they said.
Two Indian soldiers also were hurt in the first major attack since
the peacekeeping forces called an indefinite cease-fire Sept. 20.
   Military officials said the largest and most militant Tamil
group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, provoked the clash.
   India deployed an estimated 47,000 soldiers to Sri Lanka in July
1987 to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil rebellion.
The New Delhi government has said the remaining 42,000 troops will
be gone by Dec. 31.
   India, which mediated the peace accord, became involved in Sri
Lanka's ethnic problems because 60 million Tamils living in
southern India are sympathetic to the rebel cause.
   The accord offered the Tamils limited autonomy if they would
give up their demand for an independent homeland in the northeast
and surrender their weapons. But the Tamil Tigers rejected the
accord and turned their guns on Indian soldiers.
   The presence of Indian troops also triggered a violent backlash
by Sinhalese radicals, who claimed the government offered too many
concessions to the Tamils and compromised the country's sovereignty
by inviting foreign troops to Sri Lankan soil.
   Ramils, who are mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They contend they are denied jobs and education
by the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of
the population and control the government and military.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
been killed since the Tamil insurgency started in 1983. Another
5,000 people have died since Sinhalese radicals launched their
anti-government campaign two years ago.

   Sir David Lean, the English filmmaker who
created ``Doctor Zhivago,'' ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' will receive a life achievement award from
his American counterparts.
   ``Lean joins a distinguished group of individuals who have made
enormous contributions to America's film heritage,'' Gene
Jankowski, chairman of the American Film Institute, said Thursday.
   ``You must be joking! This is remarkable,'' the 81-year-old Lean
responded when learning of the honor Wednesday, said filmmaker
Steven Spielberg, who broke the news as a trustee of the institute.
   Lean, the Life Achievement Award winner for 1990, joins 17
previous winners who include Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, James
Cagney and Bette Davis. Lean will be honored at a dinner March 8 in
Beverly Hills that will be broadcast by ABC-TV.
   Lean's hits include the 1957 Academy Award-winner ``The Bridge
on the River Kwai,'' and the 1962 Academy Award winner ``Lawrence
of Arabia. Lean made ``Dr. Zhivago'' in 1965, ``Ryan's Daughter''
in 1970 and ``A Passage to India'' in 1984.

   Singer Joan Jett abruptly ended a concert
after the first set when she was hit in the face with a bracelet
thrown from the crowd.
   Miss Jett spun away from the microphone holding her face
Thursday night, then kicked the mike stand over, strode to the edge
of the stage and shouted: ``Who ... did that?''
   Miss Jett left the stage, and a member of her road company
informed the crowd, ``The show is over, ladies and gentlemen. I'm
sorry, there had to be one jerk in the audience.''
   Miss Jett had a minor cut under her right eye, said Kasim
Sulton, bassist in her band the Blackhearts, after the show at a
fair.
   The bracelet thrower was never identified.
   Sulton said similar incidents happen ``fairly often'' on Miss
Jett's tours.

   Oddly enough, playing a broken-down alcoholic
helped Faye Dunaway's image.
   The 48-year-old actress says her acclaimed role in ``Barfly''
was ``a wonderful chance'' _ to work opposite Mickey Rourke and to
undo some of the negative publicity lingering from 1981's ``Mommie
Dearest.''
   ``Mickey Rourke comes to me in a Chinese restaurant downtown and
says, `I'm doin' this thing, you wanna do it?''' Dunaway said in
the Oct. 16 issue of US magazine.
   ``I thought: Great, deglamorize, get some soul out there. Turn
the perception around.''
   Dunaway, nominated for Academy Awards for her performances in
``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Chinatown'' and a winner for
``Network,'' was ridiculed for her overwrought portrayal of Joan
Crawford in ``Mommie Dearest.''
   ``It was a movie that didn't achieve what it set out to do,''
she said. ``It just went too far and became camp.''

   A fireman atop a fire truck that speed
across the path of an Amtrak train into a collision that killed two
and injured 150 said Friday the last thing he remembers is mowing
his lawn.
   Michael Kirk, 21, thinks he was riding in the jump seat directly
behind the driver of the Catlett Volunteer Fire Department truck
when it crossed the tracks.
   Officials have declined to speculate on the cause of the
collision Thursday evening about 50 miles from Washington, D.C.
   ``I don't remember anything,'' Kirk said by telephone Friday
from his bed at the Washington Hospital Center. ``The last thing I
remember I was mowing the grass ..., then I was here.''
   Lucy Caldwell, a state police spokeswoman, said the firefighters
were responding to a report of a blaze near a home on the other
side of the tracks.
   Amtrak officials said the Crescent, en route from New York to
Atlanta and New Orleans, sounded its horn when it approached the
crossing of the private drive alongside Virginia 28.
   There was no crossing bar and no warning light at the crossing.
   Ms. Caldwell said the fire truck had its air horn, siren and
flashing red lights on at the time of the collision.
   Two of the five firefighters on the truck were killed; at least
150 of the train's 379 passengers were injured. Most of the
injuries to train passengers were minor.
   Kirk, who joined the fire department about four months ago, was
in fair condition. ``I feel all right ... just pretty sore,'' he
said.
   Frankie Herndon, another firefighter, said he felt the truck
cross the track ``and the next thing I know, I woke up and I was in
the hospital.'' Herndon was treated at a hospital and released.
   The third survivor on the truck, Ernest Colbert, was in serious
condition at Fairfax Hospital.
   Firefighters Mark Miller, 23, and Matt Smith, 22, both of
Catlett, died at the scene.
   ``We're talking to witnesses, to the crew, to see why it
happened,'' said Rachel Halterman of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   The federal investigation is limited, Ms. Halterman said,
because the accident involved a highway crossing. State police are
conducting a full investigation.
   ``I was looking outside a window and I saw a fire engine. Then a
split second later, I saw flames shoot past my window,'' said
Charles Horton Jr., 18, of New Jersey.
   The collision destroyed the truck, scattering bits of the
vehicle along the roadside.
   ``I was flipping over and over,'' said Freddie Mungo, a
conductor on the 16-car train. ``I heard a big bang. It was like
rocks flying, a big loud crunching sound and the train just
stopped. ... My worst nightmare.''
   Railroad crews worked through the night to clear the tracks. Ms.
Caldwell said about 470 yards of track were destroyed.
   Heavy equipment, including cranes and bulldozers, were being
used to move the 12 cars and two locomotives that derailed after
the accident, said Wick Leatherwood, an Amtrak spokesman in
Washington.
   Lengthy schedule delays were not expected, he said. Delays were
running about two hours Friday as traffic was rerouted.

   The Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin,
condemned the West's ``rotten lifestyles'' and predicted the
triumph of socialism over capitalism as he opened celebrations
Friday marking 40 years of Communist rule.
   ``We are full of confidence in our socialist cause and are sure
of a bright Communist future for mankind,'' he said in his first
major speech since taking office in June after a power struggle
triggered by pro-democracy protests.
   Jiang's 80-minute speech televised live from the Great Hall of
the People began a weekend of activities that will climax with
dances and fireworks on Sunday, National Day. But he gave short
shrift to celebrating the achievements made since Mao Tse-tung's
Oct. 1, 1949, proclamation of the People's Republic of China.
   Instead, he focused grimly on the themes that have preoccupied
the leadership in the past few months: stamping out Western liberal
influences and maintaining vigilance against anti-socialist ideas.
   ``Only socialism can save China,'' he said in an unrelentingly
hard-line speech filled with old-fashioned ideological rhetoric
that had gone out of style in recent years.
   ``We can borrow some of the methods used by capitalist
countries, but we cannot copy (them). We must clearly distinguish
between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy ... Extremist
democracy and anarchism.''
   The leaders who used the army to crush the student-led spring
democracy movement have insisted the students' demands for a more
responsive, accountable government amounted to ``extremist
democracy.''
   Relatively liberal officials, such as then-party chief Zhao
Ziyang, who favored compromising with the students, were ousted in
the power struggle.
   Martial law imposed in Beijing during the May protests remains
in effect, and already tight security has been tightened further
for the holiday. Soldiers with automatic rifles guard Beijing's
Tiananmen Square, the center of the student protests where the main
weekend festivities are to be held.
   The army issued a new martial law order last week warning
against any attempts to sabotage the celebrations, but the
government has not said if any threats have been delivered.
   It was the capital's first National Day under martial law, and
the red banners, bunting and flowers in the center of Beijing did
little to stir up enthusiasm.
   ``National Day? Bah,'' one shopkeeper said when asked how he
planned to spend the holiday Sunday.
   ``Some people are anxious because there are soldiers around and
they don't know what they can say and where they can go. So they
decided this year, forget it, they don't care about National Day,''
one Chinese woman said.
   Jiang's speech, attended by more than 10,000 invited party and
government leaders, model workers and soldiers, was not publicized
in advance, possibly as a security measure.
   The audience applauded 14 times, cued each time when Jiang
raised his voice in a flourish and then paused. But the 62-year-old
party leader rarely looked up.
   He never paused for a drink and his voice soon showed the
strain, nearly cracking when he closed with a call for ``the
greater victories of socialism.''
   The top party and government leaders sat behind Jiang on a stage
at the front of the hall, decorated with a huge national emblem and
the dates 1949-1989.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, whom Jiang praised as the party's
``mainstay,'' did not attend. Deng, 85 and reportedly in ill
health, skips most public government and party functions, although
he has made several public appearances in the past few weeks.
   Jiang said the party triumphed over anti-socialist forces in the
student-led mass protests, but urged, ``We must carry the struggle
through to the end ... Isolate and attack the handful of hostile
elements, make a thorough investigation into all
counterrevolutionary scheming, remove hidden perils and draw
profound lessons.''
   He praised the army for its role in ending the protests, saying,
``Without the people's army the people would have nothing.'' The
army killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people when it
rolled into Beijing in June with tanks and automatic weapons to
retake Tiananmen Square from the protesters.
   ``The newborn socialist system has experienced twists and turns
in the course of its development,'' Jiang declared. ``However,
history has proven the socialist system has great vigor and
vitality. The replacement of capitalism with socialism is the great
historical trend.''
   He accused ``international reactionary forces'' of seeking to
subvert the Chinese government by ``fostering blind worship of the
West and spreading Western, capitalist political and economic
styles and ... Rotten thinking and lifestyles.''
   The class struggle continues, he warned. ``Every party member,
especially the leaders, must maintain a high degree of vigilance.''

   Federal authorities said they made the
biggest seizure of cocaine on record at a warehouse today, finding
at least 20 tons of the drug valued ``conservatively'' at $2
billion.
   About $10 million in cash also was seized, said Ralph Lochridge,
a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   He said at least 20 tons was found, and authorities thought they
might locate even more.
   ``This seizure should put to rest any further speculation (as to
whether) Los Angeles is in fact the major pathway for cocaine
entering the country and has in fact become a major distribution
center in the United States,'' Lochridge said.
   Lochridge said it was by far the biggest cocaine seizure in
history. The domestic record until now is 8,700 pounds, a little
more than 4\ tons, seized in hollowed-out picnic furniture in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., in November 1987. In Colombia, there is a 12-ton
seizure on record.
   The cocaine was seized at a warehouse in a light industrial area
of Sylmar, a uiet, mostly residential section of Los Angeles in the
northern San Fernando Valley, about 25 miles from downtown.
   The warehouse is on a tree-lined street near the San Gabriel
foothills. Across the street are offices for the Coca-Cola Bottling
Co.; next door is a heart pacemaker manufacturer and a hydraulic
pump supplier. The warehouse is two miles from Interstate 5, the
main north-south thoroughfare in California.
   John M. Zienter, the DEA special agent in charge for Los
Angeles, said at a news conference today that the street value of
the haul could be as high as 10 times the wholesale price of $2
billion.
   ``We are trying to send a message to the Colombian cartels that
were are not going to allow them to take over the United States,''
Zienter said.
   Three men, whose names were not immediately released, were
arrested for investigation of conspiring to distribute cocaine,
Lochridge said.
   ``They claimed to be Mexican, but their accents were South
American,'' he said.
   He said the DEA had been investigating and conducting ``intense
surveillance'' for a year before moving in about midnight.
   ``It's about $2 billion in cocaine, and that's a very
conservative estimate,'' Lochridge said. ``Twenty tons _ nothing
like that has ever been done before.''
   Lochridge's $2 billion estimate was based on a wholesale price
of $100 a gram for pure cocaine. However, based on Los Angeles
police techniques to calculate cocaine street value _ $170,250 per
pound _ the value of the drug would be nearly $7 billion.
   The DEA and the U.S. attorney's office estimate that more than
half the cocaine distributed in the country now floods in through
Los Angeles. Colombian drug groups are bringing it across the
border from Mexico, and Los Angeles street gangs are distributing
it in more than 40 cities across the country, they have said.
   Cash seizures from the drug trade totaled more than $100 million
last year in Los Angeles, topping Miami for the first time. The
city's Federal Reserve surplus _ one way of measuring illegal money
laundering _ has jumped by more than 2,000 percent in five years,
to $3.8 billion last year.
   ``The Colombian cocaine cartels have marched into California and
have organized the state with a thoroughness the Mafia could only
have dreamed of,'' state Attorney General John Van de Kamp said in
a speech last month.

   The missile-firing nuclear submarine
USS Pennsylvania ran aground Friday as it was entering Port
Canaveral, but no injuries or damage were reported, the Navy said.
   The mishap occurred at 12:50 p.m. and tugs were close to freeing
the 560-foot-long, 16,600-ton submarine about 2{ hours later, the
Navy said in a statement. There were about 150 crew members aboard.
   The Pennsylvania, equipped to fire Trident missiles, was
entering the port on a routine visit to the base where submarines
take on missiles for test-firing in the Atlantic off the Florida
coast.
   The port is adjacent to the land-based missile firing range at
Cape Canaveral.
   Once the sub is in port, it will be carefully inspected, the
Navy said.

   Hog farmers continue to hold back on major
expansion plans, a report by the Agriculture Department indicated
Friday.
   As of Sept. 1, the U.S. inventory of hogs and pigs totaled an
estimated 58.4 million head, slightly more than a year ago, the
report said.
   The breeding inventory was put at 7.02 million head, down 3
percent from a year earlier. Market hogs, at 51.4 million head,
were up 1 percent from a year ago.
   Inventories in the 10 top pork states were reported at 45.8
million head, up 2 percent from a year ago.
   Hog producers nationally expect to have 2.9 million sows farrow
this fall, down 1 percent from farrowings during September, October
and November last year. Farrowing intentions for December, January
and February were estimated at 2.68 million head, virtually
unchanged from a year earlier.
   The following list shows the Sept. 1 inventory in the 10 major
states, which account for 78 per cent of the U.S. total. The first
column is the total number of hogs in the state, in thousands, and
the second column is the percentage change from a year earlier.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian lyric soprano Ileana Cotrubas, one of the
world's leading opera singers, announced her retirement on Friday
from the stage at the Royal Opera House during a rehearsal.
   Her London recital next Thursday will be her farewell appearance
here.
   An opera house news release said Ms. Cotrubas, 50, plans
farewell concerts in opera houses with which she has special
relationships before taking up a new career as a teacher of
singing. She lives in Monte Carlo.
   Ms. Cotrubas was one of the most vocally and dramatically
versatile artists to emerge in the 1960s. She had an acclaimed
British debut in 1969 as Melisande at Glyndebourne and a Royal
Opera debut in 1971 as Tatyana in ``Eugene Onegin.''
   ``I always intended to retire early, rather than too late. All
my operatic ambitions have been fulfilled and I really have no
further interest in performance,'' the singer told a reporter.
   ``What I want to do now is pass on some of my knowledge to
younger singers.''
   Ms. Cotrubas joined the Bucharest Opera children's choir in 1948
and made her solo debut with the Romanian State Opera in 1964.
   She has given concert and opera engagements throughout Europe,
the United States and Japan.

<HEAD>US Cuts Off Funds For Contras' U.S. Operations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is cutting off funds
for U.S.-based offices of the Nicaraguan Contras as part of a
continuing effort to encourage the rebel political leaders to
relocate to Central America, U.S. officials said Friday.
   One official, asking not to be identified, said the move mostly
affects the Contra office in Miami, where there are ``not many more
than 10'' U.S.-taxpayer financed staff workers. That figure is down
considerably from several years ago when rebel political operations
in the United States had strong U.S. government backing.
   But with a political process under way inside Nicaragua and
political leaders developing from within the ranks of the Contra
fighters, the Bush administration has been encouraging the
U.S.-based rebel leadership to return to the region.
   The administration's policy has drawn criticism from some Contra
leaders that the State Department is trying to undermine the
rebel's traditional political leadership.
   A resistance official told The Washington Times that the
decision effectively dooms the Contras' chances of political
survival.
   ``For me, this is the end of any hope to achieve democracy in
Nicaragua,'' said the resistance official, who asked not to be
identified. ``They're leaving the troops without a voice.''
   The State Department, suggesting that the fund cutoff was not
controversial, said Friday, ``We understand the resistance is
moving its political offices to Central America so as to better
represent the combatants.''
   It added that the resistance commanders will make arrangements
to have the duties carried out at the Contra offices performed by
others.
   Officials declined to say how much money went into the Miami
operation but they added that funding will be spent in the future
on offices the rebels have set up in several Central American
countries.
   Some rebel political leaders returned to Nicaragua several
months ago to take part in the process leading up to the February
25 national elections.
   One of the holdouts has been the Miami-based veteran rebel
leader Adolfo Calero, who has said that the State Department is
embarked on a course that not only will strip Nicaragua of all hope
for a democratic outcome but also will eventually damage U.S.
security interests.

   A 22-year-old college student was shot
and killed early Friday after he and several others from a
fraternity party chased a suspect who minutes earlier had shot
another student, police said.
   Leonard Massa of Trumbull, a senior at the University of
Bridgeport, was pronounced dead Park City Hospital from a bullet
wound to the chest, said Sgt. David J. Hoyt.
   James Piccione, 19, a sophomore, sustained a gunshot wound to
the arm, for which he was treated at Park City Hospital and
released, police said.
   No one was arrested. Police said the suspect was not a
University of Bridgeport student.
   The fatal shooting occurred just after midnight, after Piccione
was shot while at a Zeta Beta Tau party, police said.
   Several angry party-goers followed the suspect in a pickup
truck. Massa was sitting in the rear of the vehicle when he was
shot, Hoyt said.

<HEAD>Oil Cleanup in Virgin Islands to Take 1 Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It will take at least a month to
clean up 84,000 gallons of oil that spilled along three miles of
beach in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo damaged a
storage tank, the Coast Guard said Friday.
   Lt. Cmdr. Timothy Keegan, a spokesman for the Coast Guard Marine
Safety Office in San Juan, said 375,000 gallons of No. 6 fuel oil
leaked from a tank at a plant of the Virgin Islands Water and Power
Authority at Christiansted Harbor in St. Croix.
   Most of the oil was contained by earthen trenches and oil booms,
but 84,000 gallons flowed into the harbor before the leak was
stopped early Thursday, Keegan said. Hugo struck the island about
70 miles southeast of Puerto Rico on Sept. 17.
   Army Corps of Engineers equipment was being used to remove oily
sand from the beach. Keegan said eight-tenths of a mile of beach
had been cleaned by Friday, but that it would take a month to clean
the remaining two and a quarter miles.
   The spokesman said no oil-covered birds or marine life had been
seen and that ``the impact on the environment is not much to speak
of.''
   About 200 workers have been contracted for the cleanup, he said.
   In Lime Tree Bay in St. Croix, workers continued recovering
40,000 gallons of heavy oil that spilled from eight damaged storage
tanks at a giant Hess Oil refinery.
   Keegan said 420,000 gallons of oil leaked from refinery tanks
damaged by Hugo, but most of it stayed in containment areas on the
facility.
   The rest was confined in a small area next to the plant and
posed no environmental threat, the spokesman said. He said it would
take about a week to clean up that oil.

   A horde of grasshoppers has invaded this

   The Ministry of Agriculture said the grasshoppers came inland

   Agriculture Minister Moulaye Mohamed Haidara has appealed to the
international community to help in setting up a strategy to fight
the grasshoppers, the statement said.
   The plan must be put into effect in the next few days in order
to save the harvest, the minister was quoted as saying.
   The ministry said Haidara planned to go to Segou and Mopti in

grasshoppers. He also urged farmers to harvest their crops as soon
as possible.

<TEXT>
   Students in Burma have been arrested
for selling post cards that carry a photograph of one of the
country's leading advocates of democracy, a self-exiled Burmese
student said Friday.
   The photographer who took the picture of Aung San Suu Kyi for
Time magazine said earlier that three students have been jailed for
distributing the post cards.
   Thu Rei, a Burmese student leader who fled Rangoon earlier this
month, said the post cards were being sold in Rangoon by students
belonging to Mrs. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).
   He said the cards were being sold for prices ranging from 62
cents to $1 with proceeds going to the NLD, Burma's largest
political group opposing the military junta that seized power a
year ago.
   A photograph of Mrs. Suu Kyi appeared on the cover of Time's
Aug. 14 Asian edition. It was taken by Sandro Tucci, an Italian
photographer.
   Tucci told journalists in Bangkok Wednesday that reports from
Burma said three students had been arrested for distributing the
post cards bearing reproductions of his photo and each was
sentenced to three years in prison.
   The junta, which suppressed pro-democracy movements in a
crackdown that claimed hundreds of lives, rules by martial law
decrees and has set up military tribunals to try people accused of
violating its edicts.
   Thu Rei, one of thousands of students who have fled to the
Thai-Burmese border, said a poem in Burmese on the back of the post
cards says that Mrs. Suu Kyi is crying for all of the people
arrested by the government. The photograph depicts a tearful leader.
   Mrs. Suu Kyi, 44, was placed under house arrest July 20
following renewed anti-government demonstrations. Western diplomats
in Rangoon say several thousand people have been arrested since
July. The U.S. State Department said recently it had reports of
widespread torture of the detainees.
   Mrs. Suu Kyi, married to a British scholar and the daughter of
the late national hero Aung San, has lived outside Burma most of
her adult life but returned last year to be with her ailing mother.
She joined in the protests against military rule and emerged as a
leader of the democratic movement.
   The military junta that seized power Sept. 18, 1988, has said it
would allow formation of political parties and promised free and
fair elections in 1990.

<HEAD>Yugoslavia Asks Halt in Protests Over Slovenian Amendment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal presidency asked for a
halt Friday to regional anti-Slovenian protests, saying
Yugoslavia's integrity was not jeopardized by local constitutional
changes, includyvg the right to sesede.
   The concilia}Oy statement came a day after rallies in the
republic of Serbia protested constitutional amendments adopted on
Wednesday in Slovenia.
   Serbia's leadership favors greater central control over the six
republics in Yugoslavia to make the federation more efficient.
   ``The presidency stresses its determination to implement the
federal constitution in the whole territory of Yugoslavia ... and
that the current problems (Slovenia's amendments) will be solved by
legal means,'' said the statement carried by the state Tanjug news
agency.
   ``The country's institutions are protecting the functioning of
Yugoslavia's constitutional and political system and there is no
need for protests of citizens and public manifestations.''
   The presidency said it was up to the Constitutional Court in
Belgrade to rule on the constitutionality of the Slovenian
amendments.
   Stipe Suvar, Croatia's representative in the collective 8-member
presidency, was quoted as ruling out a military option to resolve
the dispute.
   ``Nobody has the right to raise suspicions that martial law may
be introduced in this country except in case of grave hardship,
broad civil unrest or an armed uprising,'' Suvar told a meeting in
Zagreb on Thursday.
   The Slovenian daily Dnevnik said Friday, ``The so-called
controversial amendments ... shall bring nothing tangibly new. . ..
They represent solely a defensive mechanism from threats and
pressures, and a legitimate right of every nation to safeguard its
dignity and integrity.''
   Slovenian authorities say the small northern republic has no
intention to secede and that the amendments merely provide ``an
added sense of security'' for the 2 million Slovenes, who make up
about 8 percent of Yugoslavia's population.
   The Slovenian parliament meanwhile proclaimed Oct. 3 the day of
Slovenian statehood. A Slovenian liberation organization was formed
under Italian occupation on Oct. 3, 1941.
   Parliament also decided that Dec. 25 will be an official holiday
in Slovenia, which contains many Roman Catholics.

<TEXT>
   Luciano Pavarotti has withdrawn from his
scheduled six performances of Enzo in Ponchielli's ``La Gioconda''
at the Metropolitan Opera next January, so he can be treated for
sciatica, the Met announced Friday.
   Pavarotti will sing the Duke in a new Met production of Verdi's
``Rigoletto'' _ six performances in November and three in February.
   ``Luciano has a severe case of sciatica which has been very
painful,'' Herbert Breslin, Pavarotti's manager, said Friday. ``He
takes spurts of treatments for it. A whole new set had to be
planned _ in January _ when it can be done according to his
doctor's regulations. His doctor is in Italy.''
   On Aug. 31, Pavarotti canceled opening night of the Lyric Opera
of Chicago's season in September and five subsequent performances
as Cavaradossi in Puccini's ``Tosca.''
   Ardis Krainik, general director of the Lyric, said Pavarotti
won't be invited back. Stating that he'd canceled 26 of his 41
scheduled appearances since 1981, she said, ``Lyric Opera is now
unwilling to take the risk of one more cancellation by Mr.
Pavarotti.''
   Breslin said that cancellation also was caused by sciatica, a
painful condition in the hip and thigh.
   Met spokesman Peter Clark said a Chicago-style banning isn't
planned in New York. ``There is no problem between the Met and
Pavarotti.''
   Nicola Martinucci, who made his Met debut in 1988 as Calaf in
``Turandot,'' will sing in the first two performances of ``La
Gioconda,'' Jan. 15 and 19. Other casting will be announced later.

   A filmmaker said Friday he may never
show his controversial documentary ``Titicut Follies,'' which
depicts brutality in a mental hospital, despite a judge's ruling
allowing it to be shown.
   After a 22-year ban on public viewing of ``Titicut Follies,''
which shows atrocities at Bridgewater State Hospital in 1966,
Suffolk Superior Judge Andrew Gill Meyer ruled Thursday the film
could be shown if the inmates' faces were blurred.
   But filmmaker Frederick Wiseman, 59, said Friday that will never
happen.
   ``Technically, there's no way the faces could be blurred,'' he
said in an interview at Zipporah Films. ``But even if it were
possible, I wouldn't do it. It wouldn't be a film. It would look
terrible.''
   Wiseman said he plans to appeal the judge's decision and said he
blames politics for the controversy originally surrounding the
film, showing conditions at the state hospital that houses
prisoners deemed criminally insane.
   ``I was disappointed,'' he said. ``I thought after 22 years, why
can't people be allowed to see a film about a prison that's been
poorly run. It seems to me taxpayers should see the kind of
institution their state is running.''
   Wiseman said that after the film was first made, state officials
such as then-Lt. Gov. Elliot Richardson ``chickened out'' and
didn't support the public's right to see it.
   ``All of sudden they became concerned about the inmates right to
privacy, which was at odds with any concern over the conditions the
inmates lived in at Bridgewater,'' said Wiseman. ``The state used
the issue of the individual's right to privacy to cover up the
snakepit that Bridgewater was.''
   Richardson was not immediately available for comment.
   The 85-minute, black and white film shows often horrifying
conditions at the hospital, originally built in 1852.
   Some scenes depict nude men in bare cells being mocked by
sadistic guards. At least one inmate shown in the film was kept
naked in a cell for 17 years. One man is shown being force fed as
he lies on a table and a liquid is poured down a rubber hose shoved
into his nose. The film has no narrator.
   It was ordered withheld from the public six weeks after its New
York debut on grounds it violated the privacy of the 62 inmates
featured.
   But in recent years, state officials have backed Wiseman's right
to show the film. Some said they would welcome the chance to let
the public know that conditions have changed at Bridgewater.
   Unfortunately, said Wiseman, the judge still believes the
inmates should be protected.
   Though the film cannot be shown in public forums, it has been
shown to ``hundreds of thousands'' of people over the years,
Wiseman said. College instructors can order a print of the film for
$150, as long as they sign affidavits that the people who are
viewing the film are within the range of those allowed to see it in
the original court order.
   In that decision, the only people allowed to see the film were
doctors, lawyers, legislators, people interested in custodial care
and students in related fields _ but not the general public.
   Since ``Titicut Follies,'' Wiseman has shot 24 films in 14
different states. They include 1968's ``High School,'' a film about
a large urban high school, ``Juvenile Court,'' made in 1973,
``Model,'' made in 1980, about the modeling industry, and
``Missile,'' made in 1987 about the Air Force officers who control
the buttons on Minutemen missiles.

<HEAD>Judge Says Secord Not Entitled to Reagan's Diaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Friday that Iran-Contra
figure Richard Secord is not entitled to Ronald Reagan's diaries
for his upcoming criminal trial.
   Secord filed a request earlier this week for the diaries and a
wide array of other material, prompting objections from the office
of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   Associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten complained that
the request was far too broad and U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey
Robinson agreed, telling Secord's lawyer, Tom Green, that ``you
have asked for everything under the kitchen sink.''
   ``I tell you he is not getting the Reagan diaries,'' Robinson
said of Secord's request.
   Green did not press the issue of the diaries, but said Secord is
entitled to material showing a number of covert activities he was
engaged in on behalf of the Reagan administration.
   One of 12 criminal charges against Secord is that he conspired
to pay illegal gratuities to former National Security Council aide
Oliver North. The gratuities were to encourage North to continue in
his NSC post so that Secord would continue to receive business in
connection with secretly resupplying the Nicaraguan Contras and the
administration's Iran arms initiative.
   Green said he is entitled to show the extent of the relationship
between North and Secord and to try to prove that if gratuities
were paid, the reason had nothing to do with the Contras or Iran.
   Green promised to try to narrow his request for documents by
next Wednesday.
   Separately, former national security adviser John Poindexter,
facing trial in the Iran-Contra scandal next year, has said he
plans to subpoena diaries of both Reagan and President Bush.

   A teen-ager accused of selling crack cocaine
across the street from the White House was ordered jailed without

   U.S. Magistrate Patrick Attridge said Keith Jackson, 18, must be

   The magistrate rejected a plea from Jackson's attorney, Charles
Stow, that the high school student be released.
   Jackson faces arraignment in U.S. District Court next week.
   Jackson is charged with selling to an undercover agent in

   The two men met privately for 30 minutes in the papal library,
but the Vatican released no details.
   In an interview with Vatican Radio, Cristiani expressed his
willingness to work with the church to solve problems in El

   ``In the past, maybe not always, there was full accord between
the church and governments,'' he said. ``At present, work of mutual
collaboration has already been activated.'' He did not elaborate.
   The right-wing president was inaugurated in May. His government

about 70,000 people dead.
   Cristiani arrived for a three-day visit on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators agreed Friday to
bar federal funding for art deemed to be obscene and lacking in
significant literary or artistic merit.
   The provision represents a weakening of a Senate-passed measure
backed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that called for banning federal
aid for art that is ``obscene or indecent'' or that ``denigrates''
a religion, race, ethnic background, age group or handicap.
   The compromise ended the conferees' work, clearing a major
roadblock in the way of agreement on an $11 billion measure to fund
interior and cultural programs for the new fiscal year that begins
Monday. It would deny support to certain art that depicts sexual
acts, sadomasochism, homoeroticism or the sexual exploitation of
children.
   The conferees, borrowing from the benchmark 1973 Supreme Court
decision on obscenity, agreed that the works must lack significant
literary, artistic, political or scientific merit to be denied
funding.
   The decision on whether a work is obscene would be made by the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   The restrictions would last a year, and negotiators provided
$250,000 for a commission to study how government arts grants are
awarded.
   ``I don't know if it's a victory for anybody,'' said Rep. Sidney
Yates, D-Ill., chief Democratic negotiator.
   ``I'm not fully pleased with it, but it's a way of resolving
differences between the House and Senate,'' said Sen. James A.
McClure, R-Ida.
   The controversy was sparked when conservatives objected to
photographs shown at two exhibitions sponsored by the NEA. One
exhibited Robert Mapplethorpe photographs depicting children in
erotic poses and homosexual and sadomasochistic themes, and another
displayed an Andres Serrano photo of a crucifix in a jar of urine.
   The Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem,
N.C., showed the Serrano work, and the Institute for Contemporary
Art at the University of Pennsylvania showed the Mapplethorpe
photographs.
   It had been proposed that both organizations be banned for five
years, but negotiators agreed that they instead would be put on
probation for a year and that the NEA would have to report to
Congress any grants to them.
   Earlier Friday, the Senate voted 65-31 urging the House-Senate
negotiators to adopt legislation barring federal assistance for
``obscene materials'' depicting some sexual themes.
   ``We do know in our hearts that there are community values that
we all share and we must uphold as policymakers and Americans,''
said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.
   On July 26, with few members in the chamber, the Senate adopted
the original version of the Helms restrictions on a voice vote. But
shortly before midnight Thursday, lawmakers refused on a 62-35 vote
to reaffirm the July action.
   Thursday's vote clearly worried many legislators, who wondered
openly about how it might be used by future election campaign
opponents.
   ``What 30-second ad might come out of this,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said was a lively topic of conversation among his
colleagues. The answer, he said, was a commercial stating,
``Senator so-and-so voted for pornography.''
   Fifty Democrats and 15 Republicans voted for the weaker
restrictions, while 28 Republicans and three Democrats opposed them.
   The House passed legislation cutting the endowment's $1.7
billion budget by $45,000, but it contained no new standards for
artwork that can receive federal support.
   Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed John E. Frohnmayer, a trial
lawyer from Portland, Ore., as NEA chairman.
   Frohnmayer, 47, confirmed on a voice vote, was critical of the
Helms amendment when he appeared before the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee this week.
   ``I think that the problem ... of intrusion and the difficulty
in making unfettered artistic judgments would be most difficult to
handle under the Helms amendment,'' he said.

   Vietnam on Friday rejected China's
charge that it had only partially pulled its forces out of
Cambodia, leaving thousands behind posing as soldiers of that
country.
   Vietnam says it withdrew its last soldiers from Cambodia on
Tuesday. The Vietnamese invaded in 1978.
   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Li Zhaoxing of China on Thursday
accused Vietnam of keeping back at least 30,000 men disguised as
Cambodian government soldiers.
   On Friday, the official Vietnam News Agency, quoting the
Communist Party newspaper Nahn Dahn, described the Chinese
assertion as a distortion ``contradicting universal opinion.''
   ``Some people in the Chinese ruling circle have taken up
verbatim the genocidal Pol Potists shameless allegations that this
was only a partial withdrawal,'' it said.
   Led by Pol Pot, the radical communist Khmer Rouge killed
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during their 3{-year rule. The
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge are now the strongest of three
resistance forces fighting the Vietnamese-installed government.
   The Vietnamese news agency said China's charge showed its
``embarrassment'' in the face of world demands that the Khmer Rouge
be excluded from any future government in Cambodia.

   China has bought U.S. wheat under a price
subsidy program for the first time in almost six months, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said five private exporting companies
made the deals for a total of 270,000 metric tons under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized
China under the program last Feb. 27. Beijing used about 1.1
million tons of the new authorization and then switched to straight
commercial deals for U.S. wheat.
   After the deals reported Friday, China will have 640,000 tons
remaining to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 9.9 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by the department at $3.68 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $36 million.
   Under the Export Enhancement Program, private exporters can sell
U.S. commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $10.95 per ton, or
about 30 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 70,000 tons;
Louis Dreyfus Corp., 90,000; Continental Grain Co., 30,000; Bunge
Corp., 50,000; and Toepfer International, 30,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 4 million tons of
U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began on
June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China bought more
than 8 million tons of U.S. wheat, all of it subsidized.

<HEAD>1990 Feed Grain Set-Aside Requirements Will Mirror This Year's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who produce corn and other feed grains
in 1990 will have the same acreage set-aside requirements as they
had this year, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced
Friday.
   The acreage reduction program, or ARP, for corn, sorghum and
barley will carry an idling requirement of 10 percent of the
farmer's base acreage, and oats 5 percent.
   Yeutter said feed grain stockpiles ``should be adequate to
maintain our competitive position in the world market, while
providing adequate supplies at reasonable prices to our domestic
feed grain consumers.''
   But he said the oats ARP was set at a different rate than corn
and barley in 1988 and 1989 and that this is being done again for
1990 to make oats planting more competitive with the other crops.
   The corn target price for 1990 was announced at $2.75 per
bushel, down from $2.84 this year; sorghum was set at $2.61 per
bushel, compared with $2.70; barley, $2.36 per bushel, compared
with $2.43; and oats, $1.45 against $1.50.
   Under the program, when market prices fall below the targets
farmers can get ``deficiency'' payments to make up the difference
between market levels and price support loan rates, whichever are
higher.
   Loan rates, or the amount farmers can borrow from the goverment
using their crops as collateral, were also announced. Corn loans
were set at $1.57 per bushel, down from $1.65 for 1989. Other feed
grain loans were lowered accordingly.
   Signup for the 1990 crop programs will be held at county offices
of the department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service Jan. 16 through April 13.

<HEAD>Senate Plans Vote on Eastern Airline Strike Measure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats on Friday scheduled a vote
next week on long-stalled legislation requiring an investigation
into the seven-month-old Eastern Airlines strike.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Senate
Labor Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said they
would seek consideration of a measure mandating establishment of a
three-person commission to study the work stoppage and make
recommendations for its solution.
   ``It is long past time for Congress to act,'' Kennedy said.
   Since March, Senate Republicans have been blocking debate on
House-passed legislation requiring President Bush to appoint an
emergency board to recommend a way to end the walkout. Bush has
refused to appoint a board and threatened to veto the bill, saying
unions and management should solve the dispute themselves.
   Democrats scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether to force a
debate on the bill. They said if successful, they would then
substitute union-backed language creating a commission with one
member each appointed by Bush, Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash.
   The strike against Eastern began March 4, led by machinists but
bolstered by pilots unhappy with owner Frank Lorenzo. Five days
later, the airline filed for protection from creditors under
federal bankruptcy laws.
   Democrats pulled the bill off the Senate floor in April when it
appeared that former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth would
purchase the carrier.
   Eastern is continuing its efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy
court. The airline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier
one-third its former size. It has been rehiring hundreds of pilots
who have crossed picket lines and training new crews.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Republicans will
oppose the legislation, apparently in line with White House
requests.
   ``We at one point thought there might be some way to have
another investigation, but after consultation with administration
leaders we determined that was not in the interests of Eastern or
its present or former employees.''

<TEXT>
   British and Chinese officials on Friday concluded
three days of blunt talks about Hong Kong's future, and China held
that sending Red Army troops there after 1997 is an internal matter.
   Both countries reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement
under which Hong Kong is to retain its capitalist system for 50
years after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in less than
eight years.
   But at separate news conferences they acknowledged they
basically disagree about what caused Hong Kong residents'
confidence in China's pledges to be shaken.
   It was the Joint Liaison Group's first meeting since the
military crackdown on pro-democracy students in Beijing in June. A
July meeting was canceled.
   ``It was an unusual, not to say an exceptional meeting,'' said
British delegation chief Robin McLaren, a Foreign Office
undersecretary.
   ``There was some pretty straight talk. Each side set out very
clearly it's own view of the situation. Both sides agreed that
there is a problem of confidence in Hong Kong; we continue to
differ about the cause of that situation.''
   Ke Zaishuo, a Chinese ambassador leading his delegation, told
reporters, ``I have to admit there are some major differences
between us on matters of important principle.''
   Ke said the right to post troops in Hong Kong is ``symbolic of
the sovereignty of China and is an internal affair of China.''
   He said suggestions that restrictions should be placed on how
many troops of the People's Liberation Army could be sent to Hong
Kong, or on the scope of their authority ``are quite wrong.''
   A British official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, reminded the Chinese that Hong Kong residents were
sensitive about the prospect of troops after the crackdown on
protesters centered in Tiananmen Square ``and urged China to pay
attention'' to those sensitivities.
   Many of Hong Kong's better-educated and wealthier citizens are
fleeing the colony, taking their skills and money with them, or are
obtaining other passports as a backup in case they want to flee.
   Britain also wants China to agree to more specific conditions
under which a state of emergency could be declared in Hong Kong.
The present specificiation says only in time of ``turmoil.''
   Ke reiterated Chinese objections to reports of what happened on
June 3-4, when troops killed hundreds as they moved to recapture
Tiananmen Square from protesting students.
   He said Chinese authorities put down a ``counter-revolutionary
rebellion.''
   ``Because of the one-sided reports, the distorted reports, and
also because of some rumors there was some alarm in the community
of Hong Kong,'' Ke said.
   The officials will meet again in Hong Kong Dec. 5-8.

<TEXT>
   The federal government Friday rejected a $6.9
million request to help Cleveland build the Rock 'N' Roll Hall of
Fame.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said the Department of Housing and
Urban Development rejected an Urban Development Action Grant
request because of a misunderstanding.
   ``There's so little money to go around they're not going to give
you the UDAG if they think you can raise the money nationally,''
she said. ``But the (Rock 'N' Roll Foundation) board in New York
said none of the construction money could be raised nationally.
   ``They didn't understand that at HUD,'' she said.
   Cleveland, where late-night disc jockey Alan Freed introduced a
generation of teeny-boppers to the music of Fats Domino and the
term rock 'n' roll, beat out other aggressive conenders to win the
right to build the hall of fame.
   But the designation came with strings attached, including a
requirement that the city line up $40 million in construction money
by Nov. 15.
   The city earlier this year approved the sale of $18 million
worth of tax-exempt bonds to pay for construction of an 18-story,
85,000-square-foot glass pyramid on the bank of the Cuyahoga River.
The state promised to kick in about $4.4 million, Cuyahoga County
committed $5 million and corporations and other donors pledged $7.4
million.
   Oakar said she would encourage the city to apply for some of
HUD's discretionary funds.

   Thousands of people
marched through this city to the police headquarters Friday to
protest apartheid and police suppression.
   The independent South African Press Association estimated 20,000
people joined the procession, led by clergymen, while scores of
policemen watched. No violence was reported during the march, which
had received official permission from a magistrate.
   Organizers claimed it was the biggest march since the funeral
procession for Steve Biko, founder of the black consciousness
movement who died in 1977 while in police custody.
   Also Friday, a man convicted in the murder of a schoolteacher
was executed despite an appeal for mercy by the United Nations.
   The Justice Department said Mangena Jeffrey Boesman, 36, a black
member of the outlawed African National Congress, was hanged. He
was convicted in the 1985 killing of Mellina Fass, a black teacher
who apparently defied a school boycott called by anti-apartheid
militants.
   Mrs. Fass, who was in her 50s, was a victim of a ``necklace''
murder _ killed by having a gasoline-soaked tire placed around her
neck and set afire.
   Dozens of blacks considered collaborators with the white
government were killed by the ``necklace'' method from 1984 to 1986.
   The U.N. General Assembly, by a vote of 149-0 Thursday, called
on South Africa to commute the death sentence of Boesman and all
other ``political prisoners.''
   The United States and Britain abstained. U.S. Ambassador Thomas
R. Pickering said, ``There can be no circumstances in which a
violent murder such as the one in this case ... could be considered
a rightful political act.'' There have been 39 executions in South
Africa this year, far fewer than in recent years when more than 100
people were hanged annually. More than 200 people, mostly black
men, remain on death row.
   About 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted this
year and are serving prison terms.
   There have been anti-apartheid marches in cities throughout the
country since the Sept. 6 elections. Most have been peaceful, but
police used batons and dogs to stop women from marching in Pretoria
last Saturday because they did not have permission.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told a police parade in the
northern Transvaal town of Hammanskraal on Friday that police had
``no option but to act to curb illegal demonstrations'' such as the
Pretoria march.
   The marches involve the parliamentary elections that excluded
the black majority.
   Anti-apartheid activists say that 23 people were killed in
election-day violence instigated by police. Officials initially
denied responsibility for any deaths but police opened an
investigation and recently said 19 people were killed, including 10
who died in black-vs.-black factional fighting and nine in
incidents where police may have been involved.
   One of the leaders of the defiance campaign, Mohammed Valli
Moosa, was released Friday after being held for 42 days without
charge. He was placed under heavy resrictions.
   Valli Moosa, an official of the banned United Democratic Front,
was one of three activists who escaped from detention last year and
took sanctuary at the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg. The three
left the consulate after the government said they would not be
arrested.
   But police seized Valli Moosa in his Johannesburg office on Aug.
18, days before the United Democratic Front and other organizations
declared they would ignore the banning orders.
   Vlok signed the release order for Valli Moosa. It prohibits him
from being in the company of more than seven other people for any
purpose, talking to the news media, leaving Johannesburg, taking
part in United Democratic Front or Transvaal Indian Congress
activities, preparing anything for publication or leaving his home
at night.

   A former Navy procurement official was
sentenced Friday to six months in a halfway house for giving a
defense consultant confidential bid information on Pentagon
contracts.
   Jerry L. Manning, 52, was also fined $2,000 by U.S. District
Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria Va., for his guilty plea to
bribery conspiracy. Hilton also placed Mnning on two years'
probation.
   Manning, who pleaded guilty July 14, is cooperating with the
Justice Department's continuing investigation of Defense Department
procurement fraud that is known as ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   In other sentencings, Hilton placed two defense consultants for
Unisys Corp. on two years' probation for participating in a scheme
to conceal illegal campaign contributions to House members who had
influence over defense spending.
   Joseph S. Zuba, 67, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., was also ordered to
perform 100 hours of community service and was fined $5,000 for his
guilty plea to charges he made three campaign contributions in his
name with $1,500 provided by the defense firm.
   Gerard J. Scarano, 74, was also fined $5,000 for his part in the
scheme. Scarano admitting helping conceal that he had made a $1,000
donation to the late Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., on behalf of
Unisys.
   Zuba admitted making donations to the campaigns of Chappell;
Rep. Bill Young, D-Fla., and Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y.
   Zuba could have received an eight-year sentence and Scarano a
five-year term.
   Manning, who was a top contracting official for the Naval Sea
System Command in Arlington, Va., faced a possible five-year
sentence and a fine of up to $250,000 for his guilty plea to
conspiracy.
   He admitted giving confidential bid information to defense
consultant Thomas Muldoon, who planned to sell it to companies
seeking the contracts.
   Manning also admitted that he accepted Muldoon's offer of $1,000
a month for information but told prosecutors he never received any
payments.
   Muldoon, a major figure in the case, was indicted earlier this
week on charges of conspiring with former officials of Whittaker
Command and Control Systems, a subsidiary of Whittaker Corp., to
influence the award of contracts by bribing a Navy procurement
official.

<HEAD>Government Moves To Reduce Foreign Interest In Northwest Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department on Friday
approved the takeover of Northwest Airlines by Wings Holdings Inc.,
after Wings agreed to a government demand that foreign investment
in the deal be cut by more than half.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Northwest's new
owners had agreed to cut from 57 percent to 25 percent the equity
interest of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in the takeover, which was
completed last month.
   Northwest was purchased in a stock buyout by Wings Holdings, led
by California investor Alfred Checchi, the new Northwest chairman.
   In Amsterdam, a KLM official said the airline, which is
partially owned by the Dutch government, objected to the
limitations Checchi had agreed to and would continue discussions
with U.S. officials on its investment in Wings.
   Skinner, who has cited national security concerns and the need
to protect U.S. airlines' negotiating position for foreign routes
as reason for close scrutiny of financial ties with foreign
carriers, said Friday's action was not meant to discourage foreign
investment in the United States.
   He praised Checchi, who formed Wings to buy all the outstanding
stock of NWA Inc., Northwest's privately held parent company. The
secretary, appearing at a news conference with Checchi, said the
new owners were ``exceptionally qualified to expand Northwest's
operations and improve its quality of service.''
   Checchi disagreed with the department's conclusion that KLM's
$400 million equity interest in NWA would put the foreign carrier
``in a position to exercise control over Northwest,'' thereby
depriving Northwest of its U.S. citizenship status.
   ``We do not agree,'' said Checchi, ``that KLM is, or has ever
been, in a position to exercise any actual control over NWA.''
   KLM provided 57 percent of the $705 million in equity Checchi
raised to buy Northwest but officially owns just 5 percent of the
airline, as most of its interest is in nonvoting stock.
   Under the agreement with the Transportation Department,
Northwest must cut KLM's equity share to 25 percent within six
months and eliminate a three-member advisory committee the Dutch
airline would have controlled.
   KLM is allowed to keep its seat on Northwest's 12-member board,
but the its representative cannot participate in some sensitive
decisions.
   KLM, in a statement from Amsterdam, said the airline joined with
Checchi in the deal because of the need for ``new strategies'' to
increase competition in international aviation.
   ``KLM's agreements with Wings Holdings were drafted on a
conservative basis so as to guarantee that Northwest would remain
an American carrier with American management and with American
crews flying American aircraft on American routes,'' the statement
said.
   A senior Transportation Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Checchi has the option of either
having KLM withdraw $224 million of its investment or increasing
total equity in the airline so KLM's share is cut to 25 percent.
   Checchi said he already has had several offers and saw no
problem with finding new investors.
   The agreement with the Transportation Department also requires
regular reports on Northwest's finances, a reflection of department
concern for the $3.1 million debt the takeover imposed on the
carrier.

<HEAD>Cabinet Offers Resignations After Prime Minister Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All Cabinet ministers offered their
resignations Friday after Prime Minister Luis Alberto Sanchez
resigned to run for re-election to the Senate.
   It is a customary gesture for the Cabinet members to submit
their resignations when the prime minister quits and their actions
were not seen as a political move.
   President Alan Garcia is expected to announce his choice for a
new prime minister in the next few days. He could make some other
Cabinet changes but most of the ministers are expected to be
reconfirmed.
   The 88-year-old Sanchez, who also serves as senator and first
vice president, resigned Thursday. He had said he would resign
before the Oct. 8 deadline to allow him to register as a candidate
in next year's elections.
   He became prime minister on May 15 _ the fourth prime minister
in Garcia's four-year-old government. Garcia's term ends July 28,
1990.
   Garcia is said to be considering naming Defense Minister Julio
Velasquez to replace Sanchez.
   Peru is suffering its worst economic crisis of the century, with
huge budget deficits and annual inflation running at more than
5,000 percent.
   Garcia's promises of reform and a tough stand in dealing with
banks and international agencies over Peru's foreign debt won him
wide support when he was elected four years ago. But public opinion
polls show his popularity rating has dropped to under 15 percent.
   He is barred by law from seeking re-election in the balloting
scheduled for April.
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, presidential candidate of a
center-right coalition, is the current front-runner according to
most polls.

   Colombian EADS with 4 grafPresident Virgilio Barco told
the General Assembly on Friday ``there must be no safe haven'' for
drug traffickers and urged all nations to sign a treaty allowing
seizure of their bank accounts and property.
   So far, only the Bahamas has signed the Vienna Convention on
narcotics trafficking, under which signatory nations would also
cooperate to seize smugglers' ships and planes in transit.
   ``We, a community of nations, find ourselves under assault from
an internahooters perched on the roof of the Dag
Hammarskjold library.
   ``I am here to lay out the stark realities of this war against
drug trafficking,'' Barco said in his speech.
   ``In Colombia, the casualties of our struggle have been mounting
for some time. A month ago, we suffered the tragic assassination of
one of our finest national leaders, Luis Carlos Galan,'' a popular
presidential candidate.
   ``But our war on drugs has been taking its toll for years,'' he
added. ``We have lost 12 Supreme Court justices, our attorney
general and minister of justice.
   ``We have lost members of Congress and mayors, scores of
journalists, thousands of soldiers and policemen and tens of
thousands of Colombian citizens who were committed to the cause of
democracy,'' he said.
   Drug users create the demand for narcotics, which leads to the
killing of people in Colombia and other nations where drugs are
grown, processed and shipped, Barco said.
   ``No doubt somebody a few blocks from this General Assembly
Hall, in one of this city's fashionable neighborhoods, taking
cocaine in the civilized calm of his living room, would balk at
this description.
   ``Yet as surely as if he pulled the trigger, he is the slayer of
those Colombian judges and policemen who have paid with their lives
for trying to uphold the law.''
   ``Now, there must be no safe haven for the narco-terrorists,''
Barco said. ``In this war, the time has come for the community of
nations to choose sides.''
   All countries must sign the Vienna Convention on narcotics
trafficking, Barco said. The agreement binds nations to outlaw
drugs within their borders, close banking loopholes such as
offshore accounts, and makes all drug criminals extraditable.
   Barco pledged to introduce the Vienna Convention to Colombia's
Congress for ratification upon his return to Bogota.
   The president also called on other nations to cooperate in
stopping the illegal trade in chemicals for processing cocaine and
other drugs.
   He further called for the industrialized nations to help shut
down the traffickers' money-laundering system in banks,
investments, real estate and legal businesses.
   ``If the international banking system cooperates in cracking
down, we can put the cartel out of business,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Street Kids' Assembly Calls for End to Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second national meeting of the
Movement of Street Kids ended Friday with a plea to authorities to
prevent violence against Brazil's abandoned children and to respect
their rights.
   ``Violence and misery generate other forms of violence,
including discrimination, illegal imprisonment, death,
assassination, and mistreatment, all of which take place in our
daily lives and rob us of our sacred right to be children,'' the
final document said.
   The four-day meeting in this capital city was attended by 750
``street kids'' selected as representatives from all 26 Brazilian
states and was sponsored by UNICEF, the United Nations Children's
Fund.
   There were observers from 10 Latin American countries and the
United States, India and Senegal.
   About 45 million Brazilian children live in abject poverty, and
of those 12 million are abandoned or are orphans who receive no
public assistance, according to the movement's statistics.
   Benedicto Rodrigues dos Santos, coordinator of the National
Movement of Street Kids, told The Associated Press:
   ``For these kids, survival is a challenge. They work at any job
they can find, are used as cheap labor, exploited by adults and
little by little are almost inevitably forced to a life of crime.''
   According to a study prepared by the Brazilian Institute of
Analysis and Statistics, 82 ``street kids'' were slain by death
squads during the first six months of 1989.
   Investigations have shown that many death squads, with off-duty
police officers as members, operate in city slums and are paid by
store owners to eliminate common criminals.
   Participants at the meeting here said death-squad members often
kill ``street kids'' who are considered to be delinquents.
   A statement adopted by the meeting's delegates, to be submitted
to Congress, declares: ``We want education, to be listened to,
dignified salaries for our fathers so we can return to our homes,
medical care and information about the prevention of diseases,
especially AIDS.''
   During the meeting a banner was unfurled that said, ``Quiet
Congressman: It's our turn to speak.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday toured a region
ravaged by Hurricane Hugo, offering ``a little encouragement'' and
a $1.1 billion relief check while defending federal efforts against
charges of foot-dragging.
   ``I do know that there's been a critic or two'' of the federal
disaster-relief effort, Bush said after a brief look at the storm
damage. ``To the critics, I simply say: I understand. We are trying
very hard.''
   Almost from the moment he landed, the impact of Hugo was evident.
   Bush's 15-minute motorcade from Charleston Air Force Base inland
to Summerville took him past decimated trailer parks, dozens of
roofless buildings and pine forests filled with trees snapped in
half.
   In Summerville, the president was shown around the Dorchester
County Courthouse grounds, which were littered with smashed cars,
fallen trees and twisted metal. He visited a community center where
a school bus, flattened by a fallen tree, still stood in the
driveway.
   Later, he flew in a helicopter over the Carolina coastline,
where Hugo had come ashore a week earlier, and flew low over some
of the hardest hit areas of downtown Charleston.
   Throughout, Bush offered words of encouragement to residents of
a state where 270,000 people were made jobless by the hurricane,
where more than 200,000 people still have no electricity and where
50,000 are homeless.
   In Summerville, he patted Mayor Berlin Meyers on the shoulder,
asked himself a question and then answered it.
   ``Why am I here?'' Bush said. ``I'm here to give a little
encouragement to a courageous man.''
   Touring a Summerville street lined with destroyed and damaged
houses, Bush talked to several residents and, patting one on the
shoulder, said, ``What spirit.''
   Besides offering encouragement, Bush came to South Carolina to
respond to a week of rising criticism that the federal government
has been too bureaucratic and too slow in helping victims of what
Mayor Meyers called ``the worst storm that ever happened to our
state.''
   The president was met as he landed by one of the most vocal
critics, Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley Jr., who said it was
``absolutely ridiculous'' that only two federal disaster relief
offices had been opened in Charleston and who has complained that,
when he asked for emergency power generators, he was told the
proper forms had to be filled out first.
   Riley said he told Bush that ``our people are really hurting''
and that the president ``said he understood.''
   The mayor also told reporters:
   ``I know his coming here helped us. We're glad he's here and I
know by being here he will see and understand.''
   Some area residents were skeptical.
   ``He's about seven days late. There's no use coming when
everything's over,'' said George Witham, 76, whose home on James
Island was demolished in the storm.
   Riley was not invited to join Bush, Gov. Carroll Campbell and
several members of the state's congressional delegation on the tour.
   Later, as he ended his two-hour visit to South Carolina, Bush
told reporters that the hurricane ``was tough. It was devastating.
   ``But the spirit of the people of South Carolina came through
loud and clear. ... You couldn't help but be impressed to hear
people say, `We're going to bounce back.'''
   As for the complaints about the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., had described as ``as
sorry a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses as I've worked with in my
life,'' Bush said:
   ``When all the dust is settled and the debris is removed, people
are going to understand that this has been a total team effort.''
   Earlier, in front of the demolished school bus, the president
said, ``I'm here trying to mobilize the resources of the federal
government.''
   As part of that effort, Bush signed legislation shortly before
arriving that makes $1.1 billion in emergency assistance available
to Hugo's victims.
   Of that, $400 million will go to Puerto Rico, $300 million to
the U.S. Virgin Islands, $200 million to South Carolina and $50
million to North Carolina, said congressional aides who asked to
remain anonymous. Some $150 million will be held by FEMA for
contingencies.
   The sources said that the breakdown, which does not appear in
the legislation, was worked out between Congress and high-ranking
FEMA officials.
   Bush said the money, approved by Congress just a day earlier, is
needed to help people ``rebuild their homes, communities,
businesses and lives.''
   In addition to the $1.1 billion, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said that the Commerce Department was making $5 million
available for the retraining of displaced workers and other
programs and that the Justice Department had freed up $1.1 million
to pay for storm-related police overtime and repairs to police
facilities damaged by Hugo.
   Fitzwater said Bush had also directed that FEMA, with five
disaster-relief offices in South Carolina, open four more in
Charleston and that the 200 employees taking requests for aid be
increased by ``as many as it takes'' to process applications more
quickly.
   Bush, his spokesman said, ``wants to make sure FEMA is
committing all its resources effectively.''
   Bush later issued a directive to all federal agency heads with
employees in a stricken area, telling them to give paid time-off to
any workers with a ``personal emergency because of the storm'' or
who were needed for clean-up efforts.
   The president made his own donation to the relief effort,
handing Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a $1,000 check from himself
and his wife, Barbara, for the Red Cross, which has committed a
record $42 million to helping victims of the hurricane.
   Noting the various private relief efforts underway across the
nation, Bush told reporters about a chat he had had in Summerville:
   ``One thing that touched me very much was a young homeowner
there saying that he had had offers of help from all over this
country.
   ``I think it does bring out the very best in the men and women
of America who want to help in a tragedy of this nature.''

   Imelda Marcos says she might keep the remains of
Ferdinand Marcos at their Hawaiian estate until the former
Philippine ruler can be buried in his homeland.
   ``My plan has always been to bring him back,'' Mrs. Marcos said
after her husband's death. ``I have committed myself to what is
Ferdinand's right to rest in peace in his motherland.''
   Hawaii's attorney general said it might take a court ruling to
say how long Marcos' body can remain at his Honolulu home.
   Marcos, 72, died Thursday at St. Francis Medical Center after
nearly nine months in the hospital. Doctors said kidney and lung
failure and a widespread infection contributed to the cardiac
arrest listed as the cause of death.
   There were no immediate plans for burial, she said, and an aide
suggested that, barring their return to the Philippines, Marcos'
remains might be above ground for a long time.
   Hawaii law requires that a body be embalmed, buried or cremated
within 30 hours of death, unless it is in the hands of a coroner,
medical examiner or county physician.
   Morticians said Marcos's embalmed body, which has been displayed
in a bronze casket in the living room of his Makiki Heights home
since Thursday, could be preserved indefinitely.
   ``There is nothing that would prohibit the temporary display of
a body in a private home if it does not create a health hazard or a
nuisance,'' said state Attorney General Warren Price.
   It could take a court ruling to define ``temporary,'' he said.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has forbidden her
predecessor's return, even in death. She softened her rhetoric,
however, slightly Thursday and said she may reconsider.
   Meanwhile, a Philippine official said Friday that Marcos' death
could encourage his family and former associates to settle claims
made by the Philippine government in an attempt to avoid costly
legal battles.
   ``We believe that there are cronies who were prevented from
cooperating because of shame, not to mention fear of the president
to whom they owe so much,'' said Mateo Caparas, chairman of the
Presidential Commission on Good Government in the Philippines.
   Marcos attorney John Bartko said, ``The Marcoses have always
been and remain anxious to resolve the dispute, especially since
their resolution could allow his burial in the Philippines and
their (Marcos' family's) eventual return.''
   Bartko said there had been no attempts at plea bargaining in
Mrs. Marcos' U.S. criminal case and said Marcos' death probably
would have no effect on the case, since Marcos was separated from
the proceedings due to his ill health.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent in a New York court to federal
racketeering charges alleging she and her husband stole nearly $200
million from their impoverished country and stashed it in the
United States.
   Mrs. Marcos continued to receive mourners at the hillside home
Friday. She allowed a reporter to view her husband's body and could
be seen smoothing his hair and crying.
   Several pro-Marcos Filipino congressmen, including Rep. Roque
Ablan and Rep. Ali Dimoporo, left Manila on Friday for Hawaii to
pay respects to Marcos.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of private aid groups from 65
countries charged Friday that the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund are eroding self-reliance, self-determination and
national sovereignty in the Third World.
   Jim Middaugh of the Development Group for Alternative Policies,
a private advocacy organization in Washington, said 200 people took
part in the group's week-long meeting held at the same time as the
annual meeting of the bank and fund.
   The bank and fund are owned by 152 governments, with the United
States holding the largest voting power.
   The private group's statement cited the World Bank's estimate
that debtor countries are transferring $50 billion to creditor
countries this year, largely in interest and principal repayments
on debt. largely because of payments on debt.
   ``With the World Bank, along with the IMF, cast in the role of
debt manager, the debt crisis now defines `development' as economic
growth geared not to the needs of people or to safeguarding of the
environment, but to debt repayment,'' the statement said.
   It added that the only way to avert a global crisis is to shift
priorities away from getting Third World countries to make quick
profits so they can keep up with their debts.
   ``Citizens' organizations participating in this week's forum
demonstrated that these policies have brought the further erosion
of national self-reliance, self-determination and sovereignty,'' it
added.
   It complained that the World Bank is not giving enough
information to private organizations on how the bank's projects
affect the environment.
   ``As the bank and IMF are public institutions, the
non-governmental organizations community also called for ...
lifting the veil of secrecy that surrounds bank and IMF
operations,'' it said.
   Bill Brannigan, a spokesman for the bank, said it was up to
countries where the bank has projects to divulge the bank's views
on their environmental effects _ that the bank itself has to keep
them confidential.

<HEAD>Polish Parliament Hears Government's Plans for Economy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The man chosen by the new non-communist
government to lead the attack on Poland's crushing economic
problems told Parliament on Friday that Western aid depends on
beginning ``difficult steps'' here.
   Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz sketched a general
outline of the government's economic plan in his appearance before
the Sejm, or lower house of parliament. He said details would be
revealed soon.
   The Sejm was debating a budget bill that allows the goverment to
take on an additional $1.03 billion of deficit spending until the
end of the year, for a total budget deficit of nearly $3.4 billion.
   Parliament members, voting 292-9 with 55 abstentions, authorized
the increase as a stopgap measure to keep state enterprises
running, although ``it means treating the illness with poison,''
Deputy Eugeniusz Brzozinski said.
   The deficit is considered one main cause behind the country's
inflation, financing a flood of wage increases that in turn tend to
push up prices.
   Balcerowicz returned on Thursday from Washington, where he
attended a meeting of the International Monetary Fund and briefed
Western lenders on Poland's plans and credit needs.
   Balcerowicz was nominated by non-communist Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki and installed in his post only 17 days ago. He
is in charge of tackling an economic crisis in which inflation is
growing at a rate of 50 percent a month, industrial production is
falling and store shelves empty.
   He wants a quick and radical overhaul of the economy to include
privatizing state enterprises; making the national currency, the
zloty, convertible; ending state subsidies to producers, and
breaking up big state monopolies.
   Changes would be coordinated with the IMF and Western lenders.
Poland wants its $39 billion Western debt rescheduled to help
Warsaw make the transition from a communist, state-dominated
economy to a Western-style market economy.
   The painful steps Balcerowicz discussed already have raised
objections in his own Solidarity camp. Some Solidarity lawmakers
complained bitterly at a meeting Thursday that the government is
allowing too many price increases.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa himself in remarks to reporters
Thursday warned that too-rapid increases in prices would risk a
``civil war.''
   ``Foreign aid will come ... only when we show readiness to take
up difficult steps and make a great effort,'' Balcerowicz said in
his speech.
   He said the prime item on the agenda is economic stability _
meaning fighting inflation and market shortages.
   He said the government will change the formula for automatic
cost-of-living adjustments to make it less inflationary and
introduce measures to check excessive wage growth; reduce state
subsidies to producers, especially costly subsidies to the coal
monopoly, and force enterprises to promptly pay their obligations
to the government and to other enterprises.
   Also this year, the government will introduce anti-monopoly
rules and create some form of anti-monopoly agency; introduce new
regulations to force insolvent enterprises into bankruptcy; and
create a market to facilitate selling shares of state enterprises,
the official reported.
   Balcerowicz noted the changes would cause some enterprises to
shut down or go bankrupt and said the state must prepare ``social
safeguards suitable to a market economy.'' The government earlier
discussed unemployment benefits and food stamps for the needy.
   Balcerowicz stressed in a separate interview with the state PAP
news agency that Poland must take forceful steps in order to
receive help from the West.
   ``Any moves undermining our credibility ... automatically reduce
the size and chances of any aid from other countries,'' he said.
   Representatives of the IMF are expected here next month to
conclude an agreement on a ``adjustment program'' in which Poland
would commit itself to economic reform. That would entitle Poland
to an IMF standby loan _ the green light to other lenders to
reschedule Poland's debts and extend new credits.

   A bomb believed set off by Basque separatists
killed a national policeman as he started the engine of his car in
this northern Basque town Friday, provincial officials said.
   The officials, who were not identified in keeping with custom,
said the car was parked near the police headquarters of this busy
town on the border of France.
   They said they suspected the bomb was planted in the policeman's
car by members of the Basque separatist group ETA, blamed for 14
assassinations in Spain so far this year.
   ETA has killed more than 600 people, mostly military and police
officers, since it started a violent campaign for independence of
the three-province Basque region from Spain in 1968.

   Mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani has ignited
the flashpowder of city politics, flaring racial and religious
tension as he struggles to wrest Jewish voters from his black
Democratic opponent.
   While Giuliani's first-time candidacy has been dogged by
missteps, the latest controversy is heightened by his unabashed
intent to win Jewish votes by linking his opponent, David Dinkins,
with Jesse Jackson.
   ``It is a naked effort to play on Jewish fears,'' Rabbi Balfour
Brickner, a liberal Jewish leader, said Friday. ``The net effect of
what he's doing is to increase racial polarization. It's a
contemptible low blow.''
   At issue is an advertisement placed by Giuliani in this week's
edition of the city's largest-circulation Yiddish newspaper, The
Algemeiner Journal. It shows two photos: in one, Giuliani, a
Republican, with President Bush; in the other, Dinkins, the
Manhattan borough president, with Jackson.
   The text says: ``Let the people of New York choose their own
destiny.''
   The ad intensified a rift in the city's Jewish community, which
made up the largest proportion of white voters for Dinkins in the
Sept. 12 primary, when he unseated three-term incumbent Mayor
Edward I. Koch.
   On one side are critics such as Brickner, who said the ad plays
unfairly on Jewish suspicions of Jackson, who supports Palestinian
self-determination and once called New York ``Hymietown,'' for
which he later apologized.
   Giuliani ``suspects that Jews hate Jesse Jackson and he's
playing on that hatred and that fear,'' said Brickner. Dinkins, he
noted, has a history of supporting Israel, Soviet Jewry and other
Jewish causes.
   Yet others, such as Eli Blachman, associate editor of The
Algemeiner Journal, called the ad fair play. ``It shows who
Giuliani's surrounded with and who Dinkins is surrounded with,'' he
said. ``There's no words of racism. It just says the people have to
decide.''
   Jackson, in Puerto Rico surveying damage from Hurricane Hugo,
said he didn't want to comment on the ad placed by Giuliani, but he
praised Dinkins' mayoral campaign.
   ``I don't want to violate the integrity of this mission (to the
Caribbean) discussing New York politics,'' Jackson said. ``But
Dinkins is doing a very effective campaign, appealing to the hopes
and not the fears of the people.''
   According to polls, 22 percent of New York City's 3 million
registered voters are black and 18 percent are Jewish. Of the
total, about 2 million are Democrats.
   The message came at a moment of heightened sensitivity. Racial
tensions arose here in August after a white gang killed a black
youth in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn _ a killing reminiscent of a 1986
racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens.
   Then Jewish comedian Jackie Mason, a Giuliani supporter,
suggested in an interview published this week that Jews were
supporting Dinkins as a result of Jewish ``complexes,'' and said
blacks had rarely backed Jewish causes.
   The Jewish Community Relations Council demanded repudiation of
those remarks, saying the election ``should not be dragged into the
gutter,'' and the Giuliani campaign dropped Mason. The comedian
apologized on Thursday.
   The council, an umbrella group of Jewish organizations, did not
directly criticize the Giuliani advertisement. Among Jews, ``Some
consider it to be legitimate and some consider it to be
illegitimate,'' said Michael Miller, the council's director. ``It
raises a lot of emotions.''
   Properly or not, Miller said, Giuliani has raised a double-edged
sword, risking alienating some Jews while he attracts those who
fear Jackson's role in a Dinkins mayoralty. ``The Jewish community
is not a monolith,'' he said.
   Some analysts said the ad marked a necessary, if risky, step for
Giuliani, who trails Dinkins by more than 20 percentage points in
the polls and must overcome a 5-1 Democratic edge in voter
enrollment to win on Nov. 7.
   ``Giuliani doesn't have the Jewish vote and he wants it,'' said
Brickner. ``He thinks he needs it to win, and he's right. He's
reaching out to the Jewish vote, grasping at it with every gimmick
and tool he can use.''
   Giuliani's strategists defended the approach.
   ``This ad has absolutely nothing to do with race. It has to do
with who are the political supporters of the candidates,'' said Ken
Caruso, Giuliani's deputy campaign manager.
   ``It's a very fair question to ask what Jesse Jackson's role
will be in a David Dinkins administration,'' Caruso said. ``It's
the Dinkins campaign that brought Jesse Jackson here.''
   Dinkins was state co-chairman of Jackson's 1988 presidential
campaign. Jackson campaigned in black neighborhoods for Dinkins,
albeit sparingly, late in the primary race, and he spoke at
Dinkins' primary-night celebration.
   Friday, Dinkins called Jackson ``my friend,'' reiterated his
support for Israel and said of Giuliani's ad: ``I know what he's
trying to do. I'd prefer that people would say and do things
designed to bring people together, rather than divide them.''
   Yet Blachman, the newspaper editor, said divisions already exist.
   ``Out the street I hear constantly that people are worried about
the Jesse Jackson business,'' he said. ``They think Dinkins is a
very nice fellow. If Jesse Jackson wasn't around him, he wouldn't
have a problem with the Jewish people.''

   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro registered
Friday as the presidential candidate of an opposition coalition
that will be President Daniel Ortega's main competition in the Feb.
25 elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
arrived at the Supreme Electoral Council with a 15-vehicle caravan
of supporters.
   ``We're going to win,'' she told reporters as she registered as
the candidate of the United National Opposition.
   Lawyer Virgilio Godoy was registered as the vice presidential
candidate of the 14-party alliance.
   Running for re-election with Ortega on the Sandinista slate is
Vice President Sergio Ramirez.
   Friday was the closing day for registrations and other
candidates signing the forms were Isidro Tellez, presidential
nominee of the Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement, and his
vice presidential running mate Carlos Cuadra.
   Other presidential candidates are Erick Ramirez of the Social
Christian Party and Eduardo Molina of the Democratic Conservative
Party.
   Mrs. Chamorro, 59, said she would register to vote on Sunday,
the first of four Sundays designated in October for Nicaragua's 1.9
million eligible voters to sign up for the general election.
   Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, arrived Thursday to meet with government and party
officials. He will observe the voter registration process Sunday in
Managua and the cities of Leon and Granada.
   The United National Opposition has registered candidates for 83
of 90 National Assembly seats at stake.
   The left-wing Sandinistas have governed Nicaragua since the
civil war that ousted rightist President Anastasio Somoza in July
1979.

<HEAD>Government Accepts Responsibility for Multiracial Schools</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, in a reversal
of its integration policies, will take responsibility for some
multiracial schools through funding or running them directly, a
Cabinet official said Friday.
   Piet Clase, minister of white education, announced the new
policy after a meeting Thursday with a delegation of people trying
to prevent the closing of Johannesburg Girls High School.
Enrollment has declined at the whites-only school and a committee
of parents, teachers and students has campaigned to save the
facility by opening it to all races.
   Mike Ellis, education spokesman for the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party, said Clase's statement represented a ``dramatic
shift in policy.''
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party, the largest opposition
party in Parliament, denounced the decision.
   ``This is a scandalous break from all previous promises made by
the minister of education and training with regard to this
matter,'' it said.
   ``We wish to send an urgent warning to the white population that
this latest step on the part of the government is the beginning of
full integration at school level,'' the statement added.
   Most public schools would remain segregated under the new
approach, but it would benefit families in certain urban
neighborhoods that are in the process of being declared
multiracial. Most of these areas have been integrated for years
despite laws mandating residential segregation.
   Clase said Friday the government has a responsibility to provide
education in ``free settlement areas'' _ the official term for
neighborhoods that will be designated multiracial.
   He said the committee seeking to save Johannesburg Girls High
School had two options _ it could transform the school into a 100
percent state-subsidized private school or apply to have the
school's neighborhood become a free settlement area.
   At present, black, mixed-race and Indian children living in
multiracial areas must either attend private schools or travel to
segregated public schools in outlying townships.

   Angered by criticism of its crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators, China told Western nations Friday they
were interfering in China's internal affairs and stop it or risk
harming relations.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen declared, in the first Chinese
address to the General Assembly since the violence in June: ``China
has never feared and will in no way bend to any foreign pressure.''
   Qian delivered a long rebuke to certain Western countries _ not
named _ and a discourse on peaceful coexistence.
   ``China's relations with Western countries were on a course of
steady development,'' he said. ``However, difficulties of varying
degrees have emerged over the past few months in our relations with
certain Western countries.''
   Qian acknowleged that the crackdown on protesters ``is known to
all.''
   It began when hundreds of people were killed as the military
swept across Beijing on June 3-4.
   Speaking of the weeks of turmoil, Qian said, ``It goes without
saying that how to deal with this problem is China's internal
affair.''
   He said most governments understand China's actions. ``Only
certain Western governments, ignoring the facts and basing
themselves on nothing but distorted news reports and
misinformation, leveled unwarranted charges against the Chinese
government and applied pressure on it.''
   He said China respects the sovereignty of other countries and if
Western nations wish to repair relations with Beijing, they should
do the same.
   ``Herein lies the way out of the current difficulties,'' he said.
   Even so, Qian affirmed that China will adhere to its policy of
reform and opening to the outside world.
   The United States, Britain and other Western countries have
reproached China for suppressing the protests, which China calls an
anti-government rebellion. The United States barred transfer of
some military items to underscore its protests.
   In the past week, Qian said, some nations in the United Nations
``continued to attack the Chinese government groundlessly.''
   In speeches to the General Assembly this week, Britain and Japan
criticized China. The United States said nothing of the issue.
   Also Friday, Amnesty International said it appealed to China to
release all political prisoners.
   The London-based human rights organization said in a message to
Prime Minister Li Peng the release of prisoners would be ``a major
contribution to the protection of human rights.''
   Amnesty said its message specifically mentioned Wei Jingsheng,
Xu Wenli and Wang Xizhe, who edited unofficial journals during the
Chinese democracy movement in 1978 and 1979.

   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt called on
Israel Friday to trade territory for peace and talk to the
Palestine Liberation Organization, saying a historic opportunity
for peace is at hand.
   ``Conditions are now favorable for launching
(Palestinian-Israeli) dialogue without preconditions,'' he told the
U.N. General Assembly.
   The dialogue, he said, ``aims at bridging the existing gap in
positions, exploring the way to eliminate the conflict once and for
all on the basis of applying the principle of territory for peace.''
   He called the PLO ``the sole, legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.'' He said the organization had adopted positive
attitudes toward a peace settlement and ``deserves all welcome and
support from the international community.''
   Israel officially refuses to talk to the PLO, which it views as
a terrorist group. The PLO says it now accepts Israel and wants
peace and a separate state.
   Israel's right-wing Likud bloc, headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, also rejects the concept of trading land for peace. Its
rival in the coalition government, the center-left Labor Party,
favors territorial concessions.
   In a bid to keep Likud from torpedoing peace talks, U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday that Egypt's
10-point peace plan is negotiable.
   ``The real question is what position the government of Israel
takes when the Cabinet meets next week,'' said Baker at a news
conference at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.
   ``The Egyptian 10 points is not a competing proposal, it is
simply a method of trying to get implementation of the Shamir
proposal,'' Baker added.
   In May, Shamir proposed elections among Palestinians to choose
representatives to negotiate with Israel for limited
self-government in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``The name of the game right now, it seems to me, is to _ for
the first time _ get Israelis and Palestinians talking to each
other,'' Baker said.
   Mubarak offered to host preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in
Cairo to pave the way for Shamir's election plan.
   Egypt is the only Middle East country to have made peace with
Israel, for which it was effectively excommunicated from the Arab
world. Only recently has Egypt been welcomed back to the Arab fold,
and it now seeks to act as a mediator in the troubled region.
   ``Letting the existing opportunity slip by will be a grievous
mistake exceeding all errors made in the past, which led to loss of
historic opportunities to contain the conflict and avoid its
aggression,'' Mubarak said.
   Mubarak's 10-point election proposal seeks to complement
Shamir's own plan and win wider acceptance among Palestinians.
   Israel Television and radio late Thursday reported Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens, also of Likud, met with Mubarak in New York.
During the meeting Mubarak made a rare phone call to Shamir to wish
him a happy Jewish new year and told Shamir he didn't want to see
the government divided over his peace plan, the reports said.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who heads Labor and also was in
New York meeting with U.S., Egyptian and other leaders, returned to
Israel late Thursday.
   Mubarak also advocated an international Middle East peace
conference. Israel rejects any conference that would impose a
settlement on it and calls for bilateral negotiations with its
neighbors.
   In another development, the PLO said Friday it accepted an offer
by the Soviet Union to host a meeting between it and Israel.
   Mahmoud Abbas, a member of the PLO Executive Committee,
announced the acceptance in a statement published by the official
Palestininan news agency WAFA. The statement was released in Tunis,
Tunisia.
   The Soviet offer was made in New York on Thursday by Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who said Moscow would be
willing to act as an intermediary between the two sides.
   Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, said the Soviet proposal was
``an important step to advance the peace process in favor of a
political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the solution to
the Palestinian problem.''

   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said he was
disappointed President Bush's visit Friday didn't include more of
the city's destruction from Hurricane Hugo.
   About 100,000 people in the city remained without power and
offers of food and supplies continued to pour in while the
president toured devastated outlying areas and flew over Charleston
in a helicopter.
   Riley said the ``symbolism'' of the president coming to ``one of
the oldest cities in America which has suffered its greatest
natural disaster in 100 years ... would have been very good.''
   Bush flew into Charleston Air Force Base north of the city,
traveled by car to Summerville, flew over Charleston in a
helicopter and returned to the base.
   ``I had hoped very much that he would come to Charleston and
that he would have been able to come sooner,'' Riley said.
   The president spent two hours in South Carolina after approving
$1.1 billion in federal aid for Hugo's victims in the state and
elsewhere. Riley praised Bush's quick action on the money.
   The storm smashed into Charleston on Sept. 21, packing 135 mph
winds and claiming 62 lives in the United States and the Caribbean,
including 18 people in South Carolina.
   In addition to those people still without power in Charleston,
about 100,000 power customers were doing without in other parts of
the state.
   South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. said 2,000 workers from 33
power companies in nine states were helping to restore power.
   Authorities continued using dogs to check the rubble of
collapsed houses in the fishing village of McClellanville, where
the storm hit hard.
   A curfew remained in effect in Charleston, enforced by National
Guardsmen, but it was scaled back two hours and is now in effect
from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.

<TEXT>
   The policy-setting body of the
International Atomic Energy Agency passed a resolution Friday
denouncing Israel's nuclear policies as a threat to peace and
security.
   It also voted to continue the observer status of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, but with a name change, and again
postponed a decision on whether to suspend South Africa's
membership in the agency.
   A resolution sponsored by 14 states, including Iraq, Libya and
Saudi Arabia, was adopted on the last day of the annual General
Conference of the IAEA. The vote was 47 in favor, 28 against, with
12 abstentions.
   It was opposed by the United States and other Western members.
James D. Watkins, head of the U.S. delegation, said the resolution
went ``beyond the mandate and competence'' of the IAEA.
   The resolution said its sponsors were ``gravely concerned about
Israel's growing nuclear capability and threat to peace and
security in the area.'' It called on the Jewish state to submit all
of its nuclear installations to the IAEA for inspection.
   The issue has been raised repeatedly at General Conference
meetings and in a speech Wednesday Israeli chief delegate S.Y.
Ettinger said the 113-member agency wasted time with ``irrelevant''
political issues.
   It is widely believed Israel has the capability of producing
atomic weapons but there is disagreement on whether it has any.
   Israel did not sign the 1969 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
under which signatories submit their nuclear programs to IAEA
controls.
   Israel has expressed support of the principle of
non-proliferation, but has made its acceptance conditional on the
establishment of the Middle East as a zone free of nuclear weapons.
   For the third year the General Conference, by a vote of 59-26,
postponed a decision on whether to suspend South Africa. A
resolution submitted by a group of African states criticized South
Africa for its ``persistent refusal'' to comply with U. N.
resolutions.
   South Africa, in a message last week to IAEA Director General
Hans Blix, said it would hold exploratory talks in December with
U.S., Soviet and British diplomats on the possibility of signing
the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which has had observer
status since 1975, will continue to have that status but the
obervers will be referred to as Palestine observers instead of PLO
observers. That name change was an Arab-sponsored proposal approved
by consensus.

   The owner of a tanker that spilled
thousands of gallons of heating oil when it ran aground in June was
fined $500,000 and the captain ordered to pay $35,500 in fines
Friday.
   Ballard Shipping Co. and the captain, Iakovos E. Georgudis,
pleaded guilty Aug. 16 to one federal misdemeanor count each of
violating clean water laws when nearly 300,000 gallons of oil
spilled off Newport.
   Later Friday in Superior Court, Georgudis pleaded no contest to
a state charge of causing pollution. A state charge against him of
failing to have a harbor pilot on board the tanker was dropped as
part of a plea bargain.
   The 560-foot tanker ran aground June 23 on Brenton Reef at the
mouth of Narragansett Bay, opening several gashes on its sides that
were up to 250 feet long, with some wide enough for divers to swim
through.
   Ballard's fine was levied in federal court, where U.S. District
Judge Ernest Torres ordered Georgudis to pay $10,000. The captain's
fines in state court totaled $25,000.
   In addition, Ballard's insurance company, United Kingdom Mutual
Steam Ship Assurance Association (Bermuda) Ltd. in London,
guaranteed $3.2 million to compensate for environmental damage,
agreed to reimburse the state $1 million and the federal government
$3.5 million for cleanup, and agreed to make $500,000 available for
claims by individuals.
   Commercial fishermen and seafood dealers filed a federal lawsuit
against the captain and the Liberian shipping company, seeking $40
million in damages they claim to have suffered as a result of the
spill.
   ``They won't accept responsibility for the drop in shellfish
price during the months of July and August,'' lawyer Richard K.
Corley said of Ballard and Georgudis. ``Are we going to have to
chase the captain and the company back to Greece to satisfy our
claim?''
   The 560-foot tanker had sailed from Greece but is registered in
Liberia.
   Ballard promised under the plea agreement to pay the state for
environmental research and park acquisiton. U.S. District Judge
Ernest Torres put Ballard on one month of unsupervised probation to
ensure payment of the fine.
   Torres said he would not jail Georgudis because the captain
cooperated with investigators, saying his actions were ``negligent,
as opposed to willful or reckless.''
   Georgudis, 43, left court without comment.
   The captain could have received 13 months in prison on the state
charges. The federal charge against Ballard and the captain carried
a possible year in jail.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor was convicted of
battery for slapping a police officer and two other misdemeanor
charges Friday, prompting the fiery actress to remark, ``I think
Russia can't be worse than this.''
   But Miss Gabor was acquitted of disobeying the officer when she
drove away during a traffic stop confrontation. She said she
interpreted an obscene phrase he allegedly used as an order to
leave.
   In addition to the battery charge, the Hungarian-born actress
was found guilty of driving without a valid driver's license and
having an open bottle of alcohol in her Rolls-Royce.
   Miss Gabor, convicted of the most serious of the charges, faces
a possible 18 months and five days in jail and a maximum fine of
$3,500, defense attorney William Graysen said. Sentencing was set
for Oct. 17.
   ``I am very disappointed,'' Miss Gabor told reporters outside
court.
   ``I can't believe in a country as great as ours that a 6-foot-4
policeman can beat up a lady of 5-foot-4 and use dirty language
like you were a streetwalker. ... I think Russia can't be worse
than this, or Communist Hungary either. I think it's ridiculous.''
   Prosecutor Elden Fox said he would not ask for jail time for
Miss Gabor, but that he would seek compensation for the trial's
cost.
   ``I want the $30,000 restitution to the court for this media
circus,'' Fox said. The amount is the estimated cost of the trial.
   Miss Gabor contended she was convicted because of her celebrity
status.
   ``I know it's Zsa Zsa Gabor _ the diamonds. She loves to talk
up, she's not a milquetoast,'' she said.
   But jury foreman John Burke, a Hollywood accountant, disagreed.
   ``That's not the person we really tried. We tried a person who
had a conflict with the police,'' he said.
   The 12-member jury deliberated 90 minutes on Wednesday, all day
Thursday and returned their verdicts Friday afternoon.
   Juror Kevin Goodman, an attorney, said there were plenty of
arguments during the 12 hours of deliberation.
   ``We weren't in a deal-striking mood. There was no compromise,''
Goodman said. ``We came to the conclusion there was reasonable
force used, even if she was pulled from the car.''
   During the 15-day trial, Miss Gabor was fined $500 by Municipal
Court Judge Charles Rubin for violating what she called a ``gagging
order'' by commenting to reporters on witnesses in the case.
Another gag order violation allegation was dismissed by Rubin.
   Officer Paul Kramer, a motorcycle officer, pulled Miss Gabor's
Rolls-Royce over June 14 after noticing expired registration tags
on the auto. As he checked for other violations, she drove off.
   Miss Gabor slapped Kramer when he pulled her over a second time.
He said the attack was unprovoked but she said she reacted in
self-defense when he forcibly removed her from her car.
   Beverly Hills Police Chief Marvin Iannone said the verdict
vindicated Kramer, ``who has been berated for the last three months
simply because he was doing his job.''
   The veteran celebrity's trial was distinguished by colorful
expletives and theatrics normally associated with the make-believe
jurisprudence of television's ``Divorce Court'' and ``Perry Mason.''
   The carnival atmosphere culminated Friday in a late-afternoon
bomb threat that forced county marshals to briefly empty the
courthouse. No bomb was found.
   Later, a county sheriff's bus filled with inmates drove away
from the courthouse, with its occupants chanting ``Zsa Zsa, Zsa
Zsa.''
   Chattering from topics like jailhouse lesbians to comparisons of
U.S. justice and Nazi Germany, Miss Gabor attracted as much media
attention during her case as she did in any previous TV or film
performance.
   ``I am the daughter of a freedom fighter,'' the star of such
films as ``Queen of Outer Space'' and ``Boys Night Out'' told
reporters during her trial. ``I am a horsewoman....I am a princess.
I am Zsa Zsa.''
   Upset by testimony that depicted her in a different light _ as a
self-important, foul-mouthed shrew _ Miss Gabor stormed out of the
courtroom in tears on four occasions. ``I want to go to Europe,''
she said after one such walkout.
   She is evasive about her age, but court documents put it at 66.
   Miss Gabor's defense hinged on the contention that Kramer was a
tempermental brute who had a history of manhandling suspects.
   ``I was screaming, `Help, help, help!,'' she said in tear-filled
testimony. ``I was afraid of the police. They were going to shoot
me.''
   The trial, lasting much longer than first anticipated, cost
taxpayers an estimated $30,000.

   CBS is investigating reported claims that the
``CBS Evening News'' in the mid-1980s aired faked combat footage in
reports on the war in Afghanistan, a member of CBS' board of
affiliates said Friday.
   ``We've been assured that they're checking into it and I accept
that,'' said John Greene, general manager of CBS affiliate WRAL-TV
in Raleigh, N.C., and chairman of the affiliate board's news
subcommittee.
   Greene said he hadn't talked with the network's news division
about the claims of faked combat footage by a free-lance cameraman.
The claims were reported Wednesday in a New York Post story.
   Speaking by phone from Raleigh, he said that the network's
assurance of an internal investigation into the matter was given
him by CBS affiliate relations executives.
   ``I respect CBS News,'' Greene added. ``I think they do a great
job, and I know that they wouldn't knowingly'' air staged news
footage. ``But since the charge has been levelled, obviously they
will check into it and respond to it.''
   There have been reports that such an internal investigation was
underway and that CBS was readying a point-by-point rebuttal of the
Post story. But the division's has declined to comment.
   That still was the response on Friday when a CBS spokesperson
was asked about the investigation to which Greene referred.
   CBS News president David Burke on Wednesday defended the
integrity and accuracy of his division's Afghan war coverage, but
only in a statement that was general in nature, not specific. He
did not return a reporter's calls to his office on Friday.
   The Post's story on CBS News' Afghan war coverage had questioned
the film footage of the war taken by Mike Hoover, a free-lance
camerman. Calls Friday to Hoover's residences in Los Angeles and
Wyoming were not returned.

   A man recently convicted on tax evasion
counts was carrying a briefcase stuffed with money when he was shot
and killed at a bail bonds company, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Robert Moussallem, who was killed by a shotgun blast Tuesday,
had $10,000 in his briefcase at the time, the Birmingham
Post-Herald reported Friday.
   Moussallem, who was convicted last week of tax evasion,
conspiracy and bribery of an Internal Revenue Service official,
said during the summer that federal agents tried to recruit him to
set up Mayor Richard Arrington in an unspecified phony land deal.
   The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office have denied any scheme to
recruit the 41-year-old Moussallem to entrap Arrington.
   A shotgun blast struck Moussallem in the face while he and four
other men were in a house where a bail bond company operated.
   One of the men, Jim Watley, who is running against Republican
Gov. Guy Hunt in next year's party primary, said they were planning
a fund-raising barbecue for Watley's candidacy.
   Watley initially told reporters Tuesday that he was in the room
when Moussallem was shot by the bail bondsman, Hoyette Goggans, in
what Watley described as an accident.
   But the Birmingham News reported Friday that he was not in the
room. A Birmingham radio station, WBHM, broadcast an interview on
Friday in which Watley said that the newspaper account was wrong.
   No one answered the phone at Watley's home Friday in an attempt
for further comment.
   Watley, 68, a retired real estate agent, has run unsuccessfully
for the state senate, mayor of Birmingham and secretary of state.
   Moussallem was a developer who unsuccessfully tried to bring a
water theme park to the area. The city, under Arrington's
administration, had planned to lend Moussallem $3 million for
construction costs at the park, but the plan was later rejected by
the courts.
   All the witnesses in the room said the shooting was an accident.
Federal investigators, however, have not yet ruled out foul play.
   The News quoted Watley as saying Thursday he had walked away
from the table where the men were sitting and was not in the room.
He said he ran to the telephone to call authorities after he heard
the shot, not knowing who was injured.
   Watley said he never returned to the room, but walked into the
back yard, where he remained. ``I never saw the body or the gun,''
the News reported he said.
   On Friday, however, he told the radio station, ``I never told
anybody I wasn't in the room.''
   The Birmingham Post-Herald reported Friday that Moussallem's
briefcase, found at the shooting scene, contained at least $10,000.
   Bill Baxley, a Birmingham attorney who was the Democratic
nominee for governor in 1986 and who helped defend Moussallem in
the tax case, said Moussallem was to come to his office later
Tuesday to pay him the remaining $15,000 of his fee.
   Birmingham police are refusing to comment, saying that all
information must come from District Attorney David Barber.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem is
bringing home the remains of a controversial 19th century ruler to
persuade his people to forgive military abuses of a decade ago.
   The body of Gen. Juan Manuel de Rosas is to arrive Saturday
aboard a plane from Paris, where it was sent after exhumation from
a grave in Southampton, England, on Sept. 21.
   Rosas ruled over a confederation of newly independent and
rebellious provinces from 1835 until his ouster in 1852. He died in
exile in England.
   Menem is expected to use the return of the strongman's remains
as a backdrop to announce he will pardon some or all of the 18
generals and admirals facing trial on charges they abused human
rights in a brutal campaign against leftist subversives during the
1976-83 military regime.
   Menem, who took office on July 8, has repeatedly said pardons
are needed to repair the decade-old rift the abuses caused between
the military and civilians.
   Human rights groups, including relatives of nearly 9,000 people
who disappeared during the military campaign, fiercely oppose any
pardons. Leftist political parties and even a small faction of
Menem's Peronist Party also are against the move.
   An estimated 50,000 opponents marched in downtown Buenos Aires
on Sept. 8 and called for ``trial and punishment'' of the accused
officers.
   ``They can hold a million marches, but the decision has already
been made,'' Menem said recently. ``I've been talking about
pacifying the country since before my election on May 14.''
   Some human rights and political groups vowed to obtain a million
signatures by Sunday on petitions objecting to any plan to pardon
military officers accused or convicted of human rights violations.
Organizers said Friday they would set up booths on streets and in
plazas throughout the country to collect signatures.
   ``Far from pacifying the country, any kind of pardon would
endanger democracy,'' said Communist Party Secretary-General
Patricio Etchegaray.
   In repatriating the body of Rosas, hailed as a hero by
nationalists and condemned as a bloodthirsty tyrant by liberals,
Menem chose a case that illustrates how political animosities can
endure in Argentina.
   ``At other times in our national life, the repatriation of the
remains of this national hero would have generated a storm of
criticism,'' said Buenos Aires Provincial Gov. Antonio Cafiero.
Now, ``we're leaving behind a past that divided us.''
   Plans call for a round of ceremonies after which Rosas will be
reburied in a family crypt in Buenos Aires' La Recoleta Cemetery,
also the final resting place of dozens of his enemies.
   When Rosas died in exile in 1877, his enemies swore ``not even
the dust of his bones'' would ever be allowed to return to
Argentina.
   The idea of repatriating his remains was first brought up by
Menem, and the plan has provoked little public opposition aside
from a few newspaper columns and several letters to editors.
   Government-sponsored television ads have appeared in recent days
showing portraits of Rosas and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, one of
his most bitter enemies, the blue-and white Argentine flag, a dove
and the admonition to ``reconcile the past to resolve the future.''
   Red posters bearing a likeness of a uniformed Rosas and the
message ``Welcome to the fatherland without quarrels'' have been
plastered on walls along city streets.
   A wealthy landowner of aristocratic birth, Rosas headed the
Federalist Party in 1828, when the United Provinces of the River
Plate were trying to organize themselves into the country that
would become Argentina.
   He was governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina's
largest and wealthiest province, from 1829 to 1831 and was asked by
the legislature to return with dictatorial powers in 1835.
   Rosas was constantly at war with regional rivals and used a
militia to dominate the other, poorer provinces.
   His opponents often were intimidated, assassinated or forced to
flee.
   Rsas earned the enmity of the Roman Catholic Church by ordering
public execution of a priest and his mistress, a member of an
aristocratic Buenos Aires family.
   His rule ended in 1852 when he was defeated by Gen. Justo Jose
Urquiza with the help of Brazilian and Uruguayan troops. Rosas
sought asylum aboard a British frigate and fled to England.

   Federal drug agents seized 20 tons of cocaine
with a street value of up to $20 billion Friday at a warehouse in a
quiet section of the city, and officials called it the biggest drug
haul in history.
   Three men were arrested and about $10 million in cash was seized
at the warehouse on an upscale, tree-lined street in a mostly
residential community of Sylmar near the San Gabriel Mountain
foothills, said John M. Zienter, the Drug Enforcement
Administration's agent in charge for Los Angeles.
   ``I've been on this job for 25 years, and I've never seen so
much dope in one place,'' Zienter said in an interview. ``I
couldn't believe it.''
   The three Mexican men, who were not immediately identified, were
expected to be arraigned Monday on charges of possessing and
distributing cocaine. In addition to the drugs and cash, agents
seized financial records, customer lists and a large truck-trailer
that was parked at the warehouse's entrance. No weapons were found.
   The seized records offered a list of leads that was ``endless,''
said Ira Reiner, Los Angeles County district attorney, during a
news conference Friday.
   Zienter placed the street value of the drug at $20 billion.
   Earlier, DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge valued the haul at
one-tenth that amount, based on a price of $100 a gram for pure
cocaine, which he called ``a very conservative estimate.'' But
Lochridge later said that when the cocaine was prepared for
smoking, it could bring in far more.
   ``If it's rocked up in the form of crack, it could go as high as
10 times above that, up to $20 billion,'' Lochridge said by
telephone, explaining that the figure was based on diluting the
cocaine to the maximum amount possible and converting it to rock
form to be sold individually on the street.
   Using Los Angeles police techniques to calculate the value of
diluted cocaine on the street _ $170,250 per pound _ the value of
the drug would be nearly $7 billion.
   ``This seizure should put to rest any further speculation that
Los Angeles is in fact the major pathway for cocaine entering the
country and has in fact become a major distribution center in the
United States,'' Lochridge said.
   However, DEA officials in Washington cautioned against drawing
conclusions that the bulk of cocaine entry into the country had
shifted to Los Angeles.
   ``We are not in a position to say that there is a major shift in
trends in cocaine coming into the country,'' said DEA spokesman
Frank Shults.
   Through the third quarter of fiscal 1989 ending June 30, a total
of 18.4 tons of cocaine had been seized in Miami, compared with 2.2
tons in Los Angeles, he said. In fiscal 1988, Miami seized 31.7
tons of cocaine, compared with 2.06 tons in Los Angeles.
   ``We can't make conclusions about overall trends and patterns
based on one seizure, despite the magnitude of that particular
seizure,'' Shults said.
   Friday's haul easily topped the previous U.S. record of more
than 8,700 pounds recorded in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1987, and
surpassed the world record, a 12-ton seizure in Colombia, said DEA
agent Phil Hartman.
   The huge stash, arranged in orderly rows up to 10 feet high
along the warehouse's walls, was linked to the Medellin and Cali
drug cartels of Colombia, Reiner said.
   ``These aren't just drug runners,'' Reiner said. ``These are the
major drug dealers. They don't get any bigger than this until you
get to Colombia.''
   The DEA and the U.S. attorney's office here believe that more
than half the cocaine distributed in the country now floods in
through Los Angeles. Colombian drug groups bring it across the
border from Mexico and Los Angeles street gangs distribute it in
more than 40 U.S. cities, they have said.
   Cash seizures from the drug trade totaled more than $100 million
last year in Los Angeles, topping Miami for the first time. The
city's Federal Reserve surplus _ one way of measuring illegal money
laundering _ has jumped by more than 2,000 percent in five years,
to $3.8 billion last year.
   ``The cocaine trafficking is in a state of constant flux,'' and
Miami, Los Angeles and Houston ``continue to be very heavy cocaine
areas,'' Shults said from Washington.
   Cocaine today is coming into the country all along the East
Coast, the Gulf Coast and the West Coast, Shults said. ``That's a
trend that has been continuing since the early '80s.''
   Lochridge said evidence from Friday's seizure would tie into
another a yearlong investigation by the DEA, Los Angeles police and
several other police departments.
   Officials said Friday's seizure came after they received a tip
this week and witnessed a sale of 20 kilos of cocaine. They then
got a search warrant for the warehouse.
   Authorities moved in about midnight on the building in the north
San Fernando Valley, about 25 miles from downtown. Across the
street from the carefully landscaped warehouse are offices for the
Coca-Cola Bottling Co.; other neighbors include a manufacturer of
pacemakers and a hydraulic pump supplier.
   The warehouse, which did not appear to have any unusual security
systems, is two miles from Interstate 5, the main north-south
thoroughfare for California.
   Lochridge said the DEA had been investigating and conducting
``intense surveillance'' for a year before moving in on the
warehouse.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp has joined a chorus
of state and local officials complaining the federal government
should do more to stop drug trafficking here.

   Bombings Friday night rattled a
nonprofit medical clinic in Cali and a school in Bogota, injuring
one woman, police said.
   Thirty residences in the school's neighborhood sustained slight
damage when someone in a passing car tossed the bomb, and a woman
inside the facility at the time of the explosion was hospitalized
but her immediate condition was unknown, police said.
   The Comfamiliar clinic, a nonprofit medical center in Cali, also
was bombed but there were no injuries, police said. Details were
sketchy late Friday of the circumstances surrounding the blasts,
and there was no claim of responsibility, authorities.
   Earlier Friday, soldiers and police searched cars for guns and
explosives at dozens of checkpoints after a car bomb blamed on drug
traffickers ripped through a hotel parking garage.
   Police said one person suffered minor injuries in the blast
Thursday night at the Tequendama Intercontinental, which is owned
by the army's retired officers' association. Three other bombs
caused minor damage elsewhere in the nation.
   In Medellin, headquarters for the world's most powerful cocaine
cartel, police said Friday they found the bodies of two people who
had been tied up and shot in the head.
   Police said they did not have a motive for the slayings, but
execution-style murders are frequently the work of Colombia's
cocaine traffickers.
   Meanwhile, a judge rejected an appeal and cleared the way for
the government to extradite another Colombian to the United States
to face drug charges, the Bogota daily El Tiempo reported.
   The Justice Ministry would only say it was preparing a statement
on the case.
   The suspect, Ana Maria Rodriguez, was arrested three weeks ago.
A judge in Cartagena, 500 miles north of the capital, Thursday
rejected a plea for her release, El Tiempo said.
   To protect judges from reprisals in drug cases, the Justice
Ministry often withholds their identities.
   In the past 10 years, 220 court employes, including 41 judges,
have been murdered, most of them by cocaine traffickers.
   The traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every
Colombian extradited to the United States as part of the
government's 6-week-old crackdown on Colombia's cocaine cartels.
None has been killed despite one extradition, that of Eduardo
Martinez Romero, who was flown to Atlanta Sept. 6 to face
money-laundering charges.
   Ms. Rodriguez is not among the top 12 cocaine traffickers wanted
by the United States, the destination of up to 80 percent of
Colombia's cocaine.
   The bomb at the Tequendama Intercontinental was the third placed
in a hotel in the past five days.
   Another bomb exploded Thursday night in the capital, at a
government electric company's transformer substation in southern
Bogota, police said.
   Two bombs exploded in the western Colombia city of Cali on
Thursday night, one at a bank's automatic teller machine and the
other at a warehouse owned by a bank, police said by telephone.
   Mayor Andres Pastrana of Bogota said in a televised speech
Thursday night the army and police were stepping up security in the
capital to try to catch terrorists before they can deliver bombs.
   On Friday, security forces searched cars at various points in
the city of 6 million, then moved on to set up new checkpoints.
Pastrana said there would be up to 120 checkpoints at any given
time.
   In the last two weeks, with only a few checkpoints, Bogota
security forces have inspected 12,330 vehicles and have found 363
pounds of dynamite, 145 guns and 17,153 rounds of ammunition,
Pastrana said.

   The death toll in Texas' worst school bus
crash rose to 21 on Friday when a 15-year-old passenger died from
injuries she suffered when the bus careened into a water-filled pit.
   Elizabeth Flores died late Friday morning. The cause of death
was listed as cardiac arrest, but Mission Hospital Inc.
administrator Tom Symonds said she was a drowning victim. She had
been in critical condition since the accident.
   Mission High School Principal Gus Zapata said Elizabeth was the
sister of 18-year-old Raul Flores, who also died in the wreck.
Their 17-year-old sister, Estela Flores, survived the accident.
   The victims of the bus-truck collision were junior and senior
high school students. More than 60 were injured. Eleven remained
hospitalized Friday.
   Meanwhile, federal safety investigators continued to look for
clues in the Sept. 21 wreck at Alton, 15 miles from the Mexico
border.
   Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra said he was waiting
for a final briefing from the National Transportation Safety Board
and the Texas Department of Public Safety to determine whether to
file charges against the driver of the soft-drink delivery truck.
   The driver told authorities that the truck's brakes failed and
he went through a stop sign, striking the bus, causing it to fall
into the pit.
   A preliminary investigation showed the brakes were working,
officials have said.

<HEAD>Postpone Plan to Privatize Electric Utilities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday announced a postponement
of its plan to return England's electricity industry to private
ownership and cited the complexity of the sale.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham issued a statement saying, ``The
government remains on target to complete the privatization of the
industry within this Parliament.''
   But it also said that maintaining the previous timetable ``would
require additional transitional arrangements which would have
introduced added complexity to the task and made it more difficult
for us to meet our objective.''
   General parliamentary elections must be called before mid-1992.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party government
plans to divide into two companies the Central Electricity
Generating Board, which now has a monopoly to supply electricity to
England and Wales.
   Twelve existing regional boards are to be turned over to private
companies that will buy electricity and sell it to consumers in
their region.
   Under the new plan the regional boards are expected to be sold
in the fall of 1990 instead of spring or summer 1990. The
generating companies would be sold in the first half of 1991
instead of fall 1990 to spring 1991.
   The privatization, expected to raise anywhere from $24 billion
to $44 billion, faces strong opposition from the Labor Party and
other groups that believe the utilities should remain in state
hands.
   The government, claiming nationalization of industries stifled
the economy and seeking to promote capitalism, has sold many state
companies to private firms for billions of dollars over the past
decade.

   Gunmen thought to be leftist extremists
ambushed a national police van answering a bogus call for help in

<HEAD>Salvadoran Guerrillas Say They Won't Accept Cease-Fire Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Salvador's leftist guerrillas said Friday
they will not accept even an unconditional cease-fire offer from
the government because there would be no guarantee of safety or
democracy.
   Guerrilla representatives said they expected Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani to offer an ``immediate, unconditional,
unilateral'' cease-fire when he speaks to to the U.N. General
Assembly Monday, and they were rejecting the offer in advance.
   ``If there are no guarantees a cease-fire is a fiction,'' said
Salvador Samayoa, a member of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front's political-diplomatic commission, in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   ``They will keep imprisoning our activists, there will still be
violence,'' he said. ``It's all a kind of show.''
   He and Miguel Saenz, another member of the commission, accused
Cristiani's rightist government of widespread human rights
violations since it took office on June 1. They claimed the
government is arresting and beating many leftist activists and then
releasing them without charges.
   The government has denied such allegations.
   Samayoa and Saenz said the guerrillas launched an offensive
Tuesday to protest human rights violations, assert the rebels'
presence and pin down government troops. Guerrilla attacks have
been reported in 10 of El Salvador's 14 provinces.
   But the FMLN officials said they still were optimistic about
chances for progress at a meeting between rebel and government
representatives set for Oct. 16-17 in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   Samayoa said the momentum for peace in the region, reflected by
the agreement to disband Nicaraguan rebels in exchange for
democratic elections in their country, and internal pressure in El
Salvador will push the government to a reasonable position.
   El Salvador's 10-year-old war has taken more than 70,000 lives
and ravaged the economy in the nation of 5 million despite a total
of $3.8 billion in U.S. economic and military aid.
   Samayoa said a cease-fire would have to be part of an overall
agreement for peace and democracy in El Salvador and the rebels
made specific proposals to that end at a meeting with the
government in Mexico City earlier this month.
   ``We want to negotiate the conditions that will allow us to vie
for power on the political path,'' said Saenz. ``That's the key
point.''
   He said the guerrillas are no longer asking for a power-sharing
arrangement before a settlement is reached.
   In a peace proposal made in Mexico City, the rebels demanded
judicial reforms, an end to repression, maintenance of land and
economic reforms made since 1980 and changes in the military.
   They also asked for constitutional reforms and clearly defined
cease-fire lines.

   The fight over President Bush's cut in the
capital gains tax moves quickly to the Senate and into electoral
politics following the president's hard-fought victory in the House.
   A high-profile Democratic effort to derail the tax break, which
party leaders called a giveaway to the rich, was beaten 239-190 on
Thursday. The Democratic alternative contained a tax increase on
the wealthy, and 64 Democrats defected to the president's side.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
Bush's House victory ``wasn't unexpected'' but that he would try to
buck Bush with an alternative of his own when his committee meets
next week.
   Bentsen, a longtime supporter of special tax treatment for
capital gains earnings, says the nation can't afford to give away
too many new tax breaks with federal deficits running at $130
billion a year.

   President Bush and the nation's
governors, after sealing a ``social compact'' to rebuild American
education, now face a more daunting task: marshaling educators' and
public support for rigorous standards and radical new ways of
running schools.
   Still to come from the governors and the White House in the
months ahead are the specifics of the first national education
goals aimed at reducing the steep dropout rate, shaping students up
in math and science, reducing adult illiteracy and getting more
young children physically and mentally fit to begin their education.
   But as they headed home Thursday from their two-day summit at
the University of Virginia, the president and state executives
agreed that the success of their strategy rests on galvanizing
public support for what Bush termed ``an America of tougher
standards.''
   There were no promissory notes signed, but Bush did commit
himself to the principle of targeting any future funding increases
toward needy preschoolers, for both Head Start, health and
nutrition programs.

   From the side of her husband's casket, Imelda
Marcos pledged to return Ferdinand E. Marcos' body to his homeland

   She said there were no immediate plans for burial, and an aide

   Marcos, 72, died Thursday at St. Francis Medical Center after

   Mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani has ignited
the flashpowder of city politics, flaring racial and religious

   ``It is a naked effort to play on Jewish fears,'' Rabbi Balfour

what he's doing is to increase racial polarization. It's a
contemptible low blow.''

   Each night, Asian fishing trawlers play out
thousands of miles of invisible monofilament nylon nets in the
mid-Pacific Ocean to snare seafood for Oriental markets.
   But the haul made by illegal ``drift-netters,'' modern-day
ecological pirates, could dictate the future of a species close to
the hearts of Idaho anglers _ steelhead trout.
   The relationship between the oceanic trawlers and the fish
associated with Idaho's effervescent mountain streams is as tangled
as the nets unraveled nightly.
   The environmental group Earthtrust from Hawaii documented about
1,500 drift-net boats operating in the Pacific in 1988. Of those,
30 to 60 boats were illegally taking fish, and even the legal boats
destroy a variety of species caught in their nets, said Wayne
Lewis, who directs drift-net enforcement efforts for the National

<HEAD>Court Begins Term With Abortion Issue Heading Closely Watched Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court begins its new term much
where it left off last summer _ with the issue of abortion heading
the list of closely watched cases.
   After a three-month recess, the justices return to the bench
today to begin deliberations in a variety of controversial legal
and political disputes. None is likely to be more divisive, or a
better bellwether of the court's conservative course, than abortion.
   The court will hear arguments in three abortion cases, probably
in December or January, that will determine whether it will expand
the new regulatory power it gave states last July.
   Harvard University law Professor Laurence Tribe said the July
ruling ``began, in a very major way, the dismantling of Roe vs.
Wade,'' the court's 1973 ruling that established a right to
abortion.
   ``The court may never say Roe vs. Wade is overruled, but is
likely to say, `Roe vs. Wade ... never heard of it','' Tribe said.
   Officials from Minnesota and Ohio are urging the justices to
allow laws requiring young, unmarried girls to get parental consent
before having abortions. In the third case, Illinois is seeking
stricter control over clinics that perform the great majority of
abortions.
   The state officials are not asking the court to overturn Roe vs.
Wade, which legalized abortions nationwide.
   The Bush administration, which urged the court last term to
reverse the 1973 ruling, is taking a lower profile this time.
   The Justice Department will not participate in oral arguments in
any of the three cases, although it is expected to submit a legal
brief supporting Minnesota's parental consent law.
   The abortion debate in America was recast dramatically by the
court's July 3 ruling in a Missouri case cutting back abortion
rights and letting states make abortions harder to obtain.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said states may require doctors to
administer tests for determining whether a fetus is capable of
surviving outside the womb.
   It also ruled that states may ban even privately paid abortions
in public hospitals.
   Holding the balance of power in that case _ and perhaps for the
future of abortion rights _ is Sandra Day O'Connor, the only female
justice in the court's history.
   In a separate concurring opinion in July, she said the Missouri
regulations do not place an ``undue burden'' on a woman's right to
an abortion. O'Connor said she was not prepared to decide then
whether the right established 16 years ago now should be discarded.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy and Byron R. White are ready to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
Justice Antonin Scalia voted to do so.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and John Paul Stevens reaffirmed their support of the 1973
holding.
   The July ruling has made abortion a hotter issue for the state
legislatures, where rejuvenated women's rights activists and
anti-abortion forces are taking the battle.
   But the Supreme Court remains an important arena for the fight.
   Here is a look at the three abortion cases on the court docket
this term:
   _The Illinois case, Turnock vs. Ragsdale, could be the most
important. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down
regulations a trial judge said would force abortion clinics to
become ``the functional equivalent of small hospitals.''
   The clinics, where nearly all early abortions are performed,
would be required to provide elaborate medical equipment and
services that the clinics say are unnecessary for patient safety.
The cost of an abortion could rise by nearly $50.
   The case could have broad significance if the court decides to
water down or scrap its trimester approach to abortion rights
established by Roe vs. Wade. That ruling generally prohibits states
from imposing health regulations that make abortions more expensive
or difficult to obtain in the first three months of pregnancy.
   _In Hodgson vs. Minnesota, the court will review a system that
requires both parents of an unmarried girl under 18 to receive
notification from the doctor 48 hours before an abortion is
performed. Alternatively, the girl may bypass parental notification
by convincing a judge she is mature enough to choose abortion for
herself.
   The system was in force for five years before a federal judge
ruled it was unconstitutional. But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed the judge's ruling.
   _The second parental notification case, Ohio vs. Akron Center
for Reproductive Health, raises similar issues. An Ohio law
requires the physician to give notice in person or by telephone to
one parent 24 hours prior to the abortion, or by regular and
certified mail 48 hours in advance.
   Alternatively, a judge would have up to 22 days to decide
whether to permit the minor's abortion.
   The Ohio law, passed in 1985, never took effect before it was
struck down by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The Supreme Court has allowed states to regulate abortions for
unmarried minors more strictly than for adult women.
   The justices, in a decision announced two months before Kennedy
joined the court, split 4-4 in 1987 over the validity of such
regulation by Illinois.

   All the world loves a lover, particularly the
Nielsen-family world. So tonight, Shanna Reed will wed Gerald
McRaney on CBS' Marine Corps sitcom, ``Major Dad.'' Odds are the
ratings will be up.
   This is because marriage, even in a sitcom, is a serious step.
   But if the script called for it, Reed, who essays a widow with
three daughters, could sing and dance her way down the aisle with
McRaney's hard-nosed, soft-hearted Corps character, Maj. J.D.
MacGillis.
   At 17, she was in the chorus line of a Gay Paree show in Las
Vegas. A few years later, she was playing Kristine, then Judy, in
the national touring company of Broadway's still-running musical
hit, ``A Chorus Line.''
   One Broadway musical called ``Dancing'' later, she was starting
life anew as an actress in ``Texas,'' an NBC soap opera. Such is
the nature of TV that the show was taped in Brooklyn.
   ``They told us no Texas accents,'' she reports. ``It makes you
wonder.''
   A tall, lithe, hazel-eyed woman with a happy-go-lucky manner,
Reed was born in Kansas and raised in Arizona, first in Phoenix,
then Scottsdale, then Paradise Valley. She is no stranger to big
families or show business.
   She was one of six kids in her family, she says, when Tommy
Reed, a big-band leader who became her stepfather, proposed to her
mother. A seventh child was born of that marriage.
   All this, plus the life of a chorus gypsy, plus acting studies
with teachers from New York's Neighborhood Playhouse and Actors'
Studio, readied her for the Great Adventure of 1981 _ moving to Los
Angeles.
   ``I like an adventure,'' she says. ``I'm a sucker for a
challenge. I had money saved and I thought, `I'll give it a year,
or one big job, and then I'll go back.'''
   She stayed, save for a memorable trip back here in 1983. That
was for the night she and some 300 present and former ``Chorus
Line'' players, dashing on and off stage at the Shubert Theatre,
all reprised their roles in the show as it broke the record for
Broadway's longest-running musical.
   That extravagant evening was much like a family reunion, says
Reed, even though some of the clan that night had played in the
show in such off-Broadway locales as Tokyo, London, Berlin and even
Stockholm.
   She had been touring with it in Philadelphia when she decided it
was time to leave what for 17 months had been her family. Her first
months in Los Angeles proved a different matter altogether.
   She had an agent, and lived with one of her sisters. But she
didn't know anyone else in town, she says. She also found it a
paradoxical place.
   Even though actors there come and go so quickly it is said Mario
Andretti drives the welcome wagon, Reed discovered that TV
producers and casting directors wanted to be sure she'd stay put
before they'd talk roles.
   ``You have to make them believe that you're going to stay there
for awhile beyond the (series) pilot season,'' she says. She did
that but continued her stage work, acting in five plays in Los
Angeles.
   As she had hoped, she landed TV work. Her dossier includes ``The
Colbys,'' ``Cheers,'' ``Newhart'' and two movies about dancers,
``Legs'' and ``Mirrors.''
   She landed co-stardom in `Major Dad'' after one get-acquainted
interview with the producers in which they just talked, and then
three auditions.
   After she got the job, she also hung out at a newspaper for a
while, watching reporters at work. This is because her
mother-of-three character, Polly Cooper, also is a reporter for a
fictional Southern California newspaper near the big, real Marine
base, Camp Pendleton.
   As a journalistic courtesy, Reed, when interviewed at the
headquarters of The Associated Press here, was invited to write a
news story. She sat down at one of the computers that reporters use
nowadays.
   As she typed away, she was advised that a network headquarters,
not that of CBS, was located right across the street. She just
grinned and kept typing. Part of what she wrote said this:
   ``It was a dark and stormy afternoon sitting across from NBC.
Oops, just kidding, that's all for now, gotta go and run down a
real story.''

   ELESWHERE IN TELEVISION _ Linda Ellerbee, a graduate of NBC News
and ABC News who now writes a syndicated column once a week,
tonight resumes her thrice-a-week commentary on life's rich pageant
for CNN after a summer-long vacation. Roasted by critics because of
her Maxwell House coffee commercials, Ellerbee is not barred by CNN
from continuing to appear in the ads.
   Only full-time staffers, which she is not, are prohibited from
making commercials, a CNN spokesman says. Ellerbee says the ads,
which still are airing, were taped last year, with the proceeds
used to support her production company, Lucky Duck Productions. She
hasn't yet decided if she'll tape more of the commercials, she says.

<DATELINE>LITTLE BREWSTER ISLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When lighthouse keeper
Dennis Dever flicks on a switch 15 minutes before sunset,
illuminating Boston Light and the surrounding harbor, he is
following a tradition that began in 1716.
   Dever is the last in a succession of lightkeepers that began
with George Worthylake, who drowned with his family when his boat
overturned on the way back to the island in November 1718. Benjamin
Franklin wrote a poem about the tragedy.
   Now, it's not tragedy, but technology that threatens to force
Dever to leave his post on this rocky, picturesque islet. Boston
Light, one of the few remaining manned lighthouses in the country,
is scheduled to be the last one automated next year.
   ``It'll be the last page in a long chapter of American
history,'' said Dever, the 29-year-old son of a onetime lighthouse
keeper. ``This country was built on lighthouses, showing boats
where to go. It's sad to think that after 273 years, there won't be
a keeper here.''
   Only six other lighthouses in the country are still manned and
they are scheduled to be automated within the next several months,
according to Wayne Wheeler, of the San Francisco-based U.S.
Lighthouse Society. The lighthouses are located in Egmont Key,
Fla.; Coney Island, N.Y.; on Block Island in Rhode Island; on Goat
Island off the Maine coast; and on the Kennebec River near Bath,
Maine, where there are two.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has introduced legislation that
would retain Boston Light as the last manned lighthouse and keep it
from being automated.
   Dever, a petty officer 1st class in the U.S. Coast Guard who has
supervised a crew of two at Boston Light for the past 18 months,
acknowledged, ``I wasn't happy at first when I got here but then I
learned to like it.''
   Although he's at home with his wife of five years only one week
each month because of his schedule, Dever said he has come to love
life at the lighthouse.
   The sunny, whitewashed buildings by day give way to often eerie
nights. Ghosts, perhaps the souls of shipwreck victims or the
mysterious ``Lady in Black,'' are said to stalk the island.
   Dever and his crew, Dave Sandrelli and Al Ux, live in a
comfortable, two-story, gabled house on one end of the island.
There is no sign of dust or clutter in the neat, carpeted living
room where bow windows overlook the pounding Atlantic and the
lights of downtown Boston, 11 miles away.
   ``I feel an attachment to the old keepers,'' said Dever. After
arriving at the light, he found the names of old keepers scratched
in rocks all over the island. Dever has since etched his name on a
a piece of granite outside the house.
   Dever named the island's black cat, Ida Lewis, after a
lighthouse keeper in Newport, R.I., who made hundreds of rescues
during her 32-year tenure in the mid-1800s.
   The island dog, 13 years old, is named Farrah, a holdover from a
Coast Guard crew who were fans of the old ``Charlie's Angels'' TV
series, which starred Farrah Fawcett. It is a Boston Light
tradition, according to Dever and his crew, to paint Farrah's
toenails pink.
   The island is dominated by the 89-foot lighthouse, where 76
wrought iron steps lead to the tower. There, two 1,000-watt bulbs
positioned behind a five-ton Fresnel lens consisting of 336 glass
prisms are bent into thin pencil beams of light that flash every 10
seconds. The light is visible for 27 miles. At night, looking up
from the bottom of the tower, the beams of light radiate out into
the sky like bicycle spokes.
   Depending on what day it is, Dever or one of his men rise early
and turn the light off 15 minutes after sunrise. When it's cloudy
or foggy, of course, the light is left on.
   Through the years, all variety of human drama has been played
out on the island.
   There was romance. In 1853, Harbor Pilot Albert Small proposed
to the keeper's daughter Lucy Long, at the top of the tower. She
accepted.
   Shipwrecks were common. One of the worst occurred in November
1861 when the square rigger Maritana broke up on rocks near the
island in a snowstorm. Bodies from the wreck washed up on the
island for months and at least one sailor is buried somewhere on
the island.
   There was skulduggery. Around 1845, the lighthouse keeper Tobias
Cook made cheap cigars that sold as expensive Spanish imports in
Boston until he was discovered.
   There was even a birth. Georgia Norwood, born at the light in
April 1932, was the inspiration for Ruth Carmen's book ``Storm
Child.'' Two years ago, the Norwood family held a reunion at the
lighthouse.

<HEAD>Wise Home Buying Requires an Educated Consumer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Make a mistake when shopping for food or
clothing and the loss usually isn't a big deal. But that's not the
case when seeking shelter.
   A home is the biggest purchase of a lifetime for most families.
   And since most folks don't buy houses all that often, they have
relatively little experience in dealing with the complicated legal
procedures, the often confusing terms and the many potential
mistakes that can be made.
   Since being an unwary buyer can cost thousands of dollars over
the years, it is usually wise to invest a few dollars in advance,
becoming informed about the problems houses can have and about the
pitfalls of buying.
   To begin with, make sure the house is sturdy. There's nothing
worse than investing a life's savings in what seems to be a good
home, only to have it filled with repair headaches or worse.
   Professional inspection services operate in most larger cities
and can check out a home for $100 or so, providing a report on its
condition and recommending needed repairs.
   Consumer experts recommend that buyers of older homes have an
inspection before committing themselves to the deal. And
considering the periodic reports of flaws and problems in some new
housing, inspections might not be a bad idea even in that case.
   A professional inspection is especially important if the house
has a septic tank system.
   But before hiring an inspector, check out their credentials.
Federal housing officials warn that some folks who have gone into
the inspection business exaggerate flaws and then offer to make
repairs at inflated costs.
   Things to have carefully checked in older homes include run-down
equipment such as the furnace, air conditioning and water heaters.
Wet basements may also be a problem, and the home should be checked
for termites, inadequate or outdated wiring, faulty plumbing and
the condition of the roof.
   While you're thinking about all this, of course, people are
tossing around words like amortization and easement, swayle and
casement, Gambrel roof and quitclaim deed. It's enough to boggle
the mind.
   A wise buyer will do a bit of homework beforehand, and there are
some low-cost booklets available from the government that can help
prevent at least a few housing headaches.
   ``Wise Home Buying'' is a good one to start with. Only 24 pages,
this booklet from the Department of Housing and Urban Development
packs in lots of advice and warnings, reminders of problems to
watch for and how to avoid many of them.
   Two other nearly essential booklets are simple lists of terms
and what they mean _ keys to the complicated terminology of today's
housing.
   ``Home Buyer's Vocabulary'' lists terms dealing with deeds,
sales and legal considerations in the purchase of a house, while
``Homeowners Glossary of Building Terms'' includes housing
construction terms.
   These and several other handy housing-related booklets may be
purchased from the Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colo.,
81009. Order as follows:
   _``Wise Home Buying,'' $1, item number 163V.
   _``Home Buyer's Vocabulary,'' $1, item number 161V.
   _``Homeowner's Glossary of Building Terms,'' $1, item number
162V.
   _``A Consumer's Guide to Mortgage Lock-Ins,'' 50 cents, item
426V.
   _``A Consumer's Guide to Mortgage Refinancing,'' 50 cents, item
427V.
   _``Consumer Handbook on Adjustable-Rate Mortgages,'' 50 cents,
item 428V.
   _``Mortgage Money Guide,'' $1, item 137V.
   _``How to Buy a Manufactured (Mobile) Home,'' 50 cents, item
429V.

<HEAD>Further Stirrings of Tax Discontent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital gains bill still has a long way to
go before it becomes law, but already you can feel some faint
stirring of discontent about its limitations.
   Criticism of two aspects of the bill just passed by the House
are bound to make their way into discussions in the Senate.
   First of them is the absence of any inflation adjustment for
existing asset-holders. Next is the two-year limitation on the
reduction.
   Almost forgotten in such discussions will be an awareness of the
ostensible reason for the cut, which is to provide the federal
government with more revenue rather than to do favors for certain
constituencies.
   As passed by the House, the capital gains tax bill would lower
to 19.6 percent the highest tax bracket for capital gains, which
are the financial rewards of long-term investments _ equities,
stocks, real estate and the like.
   Most people with capital gains now pay 28 percent to 33 percent.
Those less well off also may have important capital gains,
political oratory notwithstanding. Their tax would drop to 10.5
percent from 15 percent.
   These percentages, however, would last just two years, after
which the tax would return to 28 percent and 15 percent.
Thereafter, capital investments would be indexed to wring out the
false profit of inflation.
   By this means, it is hoped, individuals will be encouraged to
sell their investments now gathering dust, at which time they will
be compelled to pay capital gains taxes, which are assessed only
after the assets are sold.
   It is generally believed that many people have been holding on
to their assets because they cannot afford to sell and pay the tax.
Not just the very rich either. Some ordinary folks have seen their
money expand 10 times in 20 years.
   No doubt, some of these people will view the two-year period as
a rare opportunity, and so will take the cash, pay the tax and
reinvest in something more in keeping with their current life
style. Uncle Sam's revenues will rise.
   However, there is less certainty on another contention: that
investors will be encouraged by lower taxes to invest in new
enterprises that will grow into firms employing lots of people and
paying lots of taxes.
   Criticism on this score will come from a wide variety of
small-business people, including venture capitalists, who already
are saying that two years is not enough. Capital investments are
long term, they say. Two years is not.
   As they see it, if this aspect of the law is to encourage
entrepreneurial investments, it must be extended by several more
years, or even indefinitely. Two years, they say, is not enough
time to earn a respectable profit.
   Perhaps an even larger squawk could come from investors who feel
that past inflation should be deducted from their capital gains.
They have a point, because inflation might account for half their
so-called profits, or even more.
   It is conceivable that even with the tax deduction some people
could end up as losers. Such an unhappy situation could result, for
example, if the rate of inflation approached, equaled or exceeded
the investment rate of return.
   Logic would seem to apply to the past as well as to the future.
If those with gains after 1992 are to be tax-exempted from
inflation why shouldn't earlier investors be treated in the same
fashion?
   You might think the answer is clear cut, but it isn't. Logic is
not the issue, taxes are. The whole idea is to raise revenues, spur
economic activity and try to finance the government _ not to
provide justice.
   The latter belongs to another, entirely separate branch of
government.

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some chant. Some meditate. Some
dance. Some sit in the lotus position and hum.
   Every year hundreds of devotees of the occult trek to Giza
Plateau near Cairo to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped
inside the pyramids of the pharaohs Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus.
   Pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills, give glimpses into
the future, provide a better night's sleep, even halt aging _ all
for the price of admission, three Egyptian pounds ($1.20).
   Until now.
   Under new rules, pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more
_ a lot more.
   Zahi Hawass, Giza Plateau's director general, said groups of up
to 15 now are allowed ``to meditate or seek extrasensory powers''
in the pyramids for 1,000 Egyptian pounds ($400) and only outside
normal tourist hours. Each extra participant pays 50 pounds ($20).
   Hawass said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to
conduct seances inside the pyramids. Most want either to spend the
night inside or to enter at the first rays of dawn.
   ``In the U.S. and elsewhere you have a lot of people with
problems, and these people are seeking solutions. They look to the
supernatural, and they think of the pyramids,'' Hawass said.
   ``But we can't let these groups interfere with tourists wanting
to look at the pyramids from a historical or architectural
standpoint.''
   Hawass said the most active pyramid-visiting mystical groups in
the United States are several from Santa Barbara, Calif., and from
the Edgar Cayce Foundation of Virginia Beach, Va., named after the
American psychic who died in 1945. Cayce taught that the secrets of
Atlantis and knowledge of the future are buried under the right
front paw of the Sphinx at the foot of Giza Plateau.
   In addition to Americans, theme cruises are organized in Europe
and growing numbers of Japanese tours come to Giza especially to
``tap pyramid power,'' Hawass said.
   ``This pyramid power stuff is really big,'' he said. ``People
want to believe in magic, and big structures give an air of magic.
I'm sure if I called myself the Pyramid Prophet I could have a
following larger than the most famous Indian guru.''
   Built about 4,600 years ago, the pyramids remain enigmas to
scientists as well as to seekers of the unknown.
   The first person to enter the Great Pyramid of Cheops in
post-pharaonic times was the caliph of Baghdad, Abdullah al-Ma'mun,
in 820 A.D. He forced his way in by heating rocks, then breaking
them by pouring on vinegar.
   As generations of scientists and tourists, eccentrics and
treasure hunters followed him, pyramid mystique grew over the ages.
   Perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the
occult was Napoleon Bonaparte, who spent the night of Aug. 12,
1799, inside Cheops' pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken.
   He went to his grave in 1821 without telling what he experienced.
   ``No! What's the use,'' Napoleon was said to have told a friend.
``You wouldn't believe me anyway.''
   Hawass said many people, especially in the United States, have
ideas and theories about the Giza pyramids, particularly Cheops'
Great Pyramid.
   ``They read that Cheops is made of 2.3 million blocks, each one
weighing 2{ tons to 15 tons, each side at an angle of 51 degrees,
50 minutes and 35 seconds,'' he said.
   ``They think nobody on Earth could have built this. That the
pyramids were built by people from outer space, or survivors from
the lost continent of Atlantis.
   ``They never look at what's attached to the pyramids, the
structures, the organization necessary to build them, the cult of
the king.''
   He said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been
published in the United States, ``but fewer than half a dozen
contain any science of value.''
   Hawass, who has a doctorate in Egyptology from the University of
Pennsylvania and has lectured throughout North America about the
pyramids, said he'd never heard of pyramid power until he went
there in 1977.
   ``I was speaking to an audience in Hartford, Conn., and as I
began to talk everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his
head. I asked, `What are you doing?,' and they explained about
power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid.
   ``OK. I try to be open-minded. When I returned, I tried some
experiments.''
   The first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve
bodies.
   ``I bought some meat and put part of it in my office, part
inside Cheops. The meat inside my office lasted longer than inside
the pyramid. That was one (myth) down.
   ``If the ancient Egyptians knew that flesh could be preserved by
placing a corpse under a pyramid, then why did they invent
mummification?''

<TEXT>
   Dreyfus Corp. is spending upwards of $20 million
on what may become the mutual fund industry's equivalent of the
supermarket coupon or the cut-rate auto loan.
   Howard Stein, chairman and chief executive of the prominent
money-management firm since 1965, hopes the investment will pay big
dividends for Dreyfus among a giant new generation of investors.
   The money is going to cover the management fee and expenses,
normally collected from the fund itself, of the Dreyfus Worldwide
Dollar Money Market Fund, which began operations last Feb. 27.
   With its sponsor picking up the costs, the Worldwide Dollar fund
has predictably ranked among the highest-yielding money market
funds ever since.
   As of last Wednesday its seven-day yield, reported by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, stood at 9.13 percent,
compared to an industry average of 8.21 percent.
   Though it has long been common practice for sponsors of new
funds to charge no fees during the launching period, nobody before
has taken the idea quite so far.
   Dreyfus has promised to keep paying the costs at least until
Dec. 25 or the point when the fund's assets, which recently
surpassed $3 billion, reach $3.5 billion.
   At that stage, the firm has said, it will consider extending the
cutoff point further.
   Some skeptical financial advisers have cautioned that this is a
gimmick _ an enticement to attract people into a fund whose yield
is likely to drop back into the pack once Dreyfus phases out the
incentives, as it surely must if it is ever going to make any money
from the venture.
   But Stein, in an interview in his Manhattan apartment a half a
block from Central Park, says there is a distinct purpose behind
the strategy.
   The target, he says, is ``a different group of investors, the
younger group that's just beginning to save. They have been brought
up on sales everywhere.''
   Stein seems pleased with the results to date. Dreyfus has just
adopted a similar ``no cost'' incentive for a fund investing in
tax-exempt municipal securities, and plans to use it with some
other funds as well, he says.
   After its explosive growth with many new products in the 1980s,
Stein says, the mutual fund business is becoming ``a mature
industry. But we are seeing growth in another area.''
   At a time when the baby boom generation is approaching the age
when people traditionally increase their savings and investment
activity, he observes, the Bush administration and Congress are
debating new measures to increase savings _ for example, a
restoration of the tax break for long-term capital gains.
   ``We're looking at a national desire to save and new incentives
to save coming down the road in the 1990s,'' Stein says.
   No matter how much emphasis the country places on such things,
however, he believes the free-wheeling, deregulated atmosphere of
the financial world in the 1980s is going to change.
   ``I expect to see a lot more surveillance and restraints, and
that's all to the good,'' he says. ``A lack of surveillance is not
a long-term positive. When people are not watching, somebody will
take a chance.''
   For example, he says, after the boom in debt-financed takeovers
and buyouts of the past several years, ``there is a distinct
possibility of a junk-bond episode that will affect the
marketplace.''
   ``Conditions are going to be forced to be addressed,'' he adds.
The circumstances that bring on change may be painful, he
acknowledges, ``but the more painful the process, the more the
system will be cleansed.''

<HEAD>Chapman, Etheridge Try To Defy Sophomore Jinx With New Albums</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Tracy Chapman and Melissa Etheridge
recorded followups to their popular debut albums this year, they
turned to the same producers, same musicians and, in Chapman's
case, even the same microphone used the first time around.
   It remains to be seen, of course, if they can duplicate the
success.
   Answers will come soon. Etheridge's ``Brave and Crazy'' was
released in mid-September and Chapman's ``Crossroads'' followed a
few weeks later.
   They'll be trying to defy one of the music business' toughest
obstacles _ the sophomore jinx. Music history is replete with
artists who crumbled under the high expectations caused by
successful debut albums. Remember the Knack? Others who fell victim
to the jinx include Christopher Cross, Meat Loaf, Cyndi Lauper and
Human League.
   The Grammy Award-winning Chapman burst onto the scene last year,
selling 3 million copies of a folk album filled with gentle love
songs and pointed political barbs.
   In contrast to Chapman, whose album was an instant,
precedent-shattering success, Etheridge started slowly. But her
album of smoldering rock tunes reached gold status (500,000 sales)
when word spread of her bracing live performances.
   Etheridge seemed to sum up the approach of both artists to their
sophomore efforts when she talked of her already-recorded new album
during an April interview.
   ``There's nothing outrageously different,'' she said. ``It's
just the next step. Technically, musically, it's the same thing.''
   Etheridge's manager, Bill Leopold, wouldn't allow her to be
interviewed this fall about the new album, both because he didn't
want her to be mentioned in the same article with another female
artist and nervousness over the sophomore effort, said Sandy
Sowatka, a publicist at Island Records.
   Paranoia is a frequent response to second album pressures.
Artists can tie their stomachs in knots worrying about which way to
turn. Should they use the same approach as the first album and hear
accusations that they're repeating themselves or change styles and
risk alienating the people who made them a success?
   ``Both of those thoughts occurred to me,'' said David
Kershenbaum, who co-produced ``Crossroads'' with Chapman.
   ``What it was on the first album was basically her and her
guitar with us filling in the blanks,'' Kershenbaum said. ``That's
what we did on this new record. We didn't do any more and we didn't
do any less. Even though we didn't consciously try, the record
turned out differently.''
   Chapman also wouldn't talk about the new record, but her sudden
fame is clearly on her mind. The title cut of ``Crossroads'' talks
about pressures she faced to ``sell your soul'' and concludes with
the admonition, ``All you demons go back to hell.''
   ``She was very clear when she came in and very strong,''
Kershenbaum said. ``I didn't detect any insecurity at all, nowhere
near what could have been with the pressure of a followup record
like this.''
   That wasn't the case with some of the musicians, who were a
little nervous, he said.
   Musicians Larry Klein, Denny Fongheiser and Jack Holder all make
return appearances backing Chapman. New guests include Neil Young,
``Saturday Night Live'' guitarist G.E. Smith and former Bob Dylan
violinist Scarlet Rivera. Chapman used some new guitars, but asked
for the same microphone to duplicate vocals from her debut.
   The mix of personal and world politics on ``Crossroads'' is
roughly the same as on the first record. ``Freedom Now'' is about
jailed South African leader Nelson Mandela, and ``Material World''
is bitter in its denunciation of upwardly mobile people who forget
their roots.
   Both Chapman and Etheridge seem to have stockpiled material to
tide them over in case of writer's block. Some of the publishing
credits on Chapman's songs date to 1982 and 1984, while Etheridge
has been performing several of the ``Brave and Crazy'' songs for
more than a year.
   Expectations seem to differ slightly for both records.
   Chapman's record is out in time for the Christmas buying season,
but her record company seems to be positioning Chapman as an artist
of longevity, such as Dylan or Joni Mitchell, said Paul Grein,
author of Billboard magazine's ``Chart Beat'' column. It's also
significant that the record is out 15 months after the debut, he
said.
   Anticipation for ``Crossroads'' is ``not as high as it would be
if she had waited longer,'' Grein said. ``It would have put more
pressure on her. She was smart to come fairly quickly and get the
followup out of the way.''
   Etheridge's management, by contrast, seems poised to make the
Kansas-born artist a star. The single ``No Souvenirs'' came out a
month in advance of the album to whet the audience's appetite, and
Etheridge is booked for five nights later this month at the Bottom
Line, New York City's industry showcase club.
   ``She's positioned very well,'' Grein said. ``The first album
did well and got a great critical reaction but wasn't a home run. I
think she's in a good position to go further with this album.''
   Such songs as ``No Souvenirs,'' ``The Angels'' and ``Skin Deep''
have sweeping rock hooks well designed for frequent radio airplay.
Etheridge is still sifting through the shards of shattered
relationships for her best material, but the new record is harder
rocking, less downbeat than the first.
   Again, her acoustic guitar _ which is attacked more often than
strummed _ is at the center of her band's sound. Etheridge produced
the record with Kevin McCormick and Niko Bolas, just like the debut.
   Kershenbaum, whose own career has blossomed with interest in the
minimalist style he and Chapman used on the first album, is
philosophic about the sophomore pressure.
   ``A lot of people are going to be very interested in seeing how
the second album does. Did she beat it? Does it sound the same? Was
she lucky the first time?'' he said. ``What happens with a record
like that, when we have that much exposure, is that we come to bat
in a really heavy posture on the next one.
   ``If we did our job well and people like our songs, then that's
going to help us. If they don't like the songs, then no matter what
we did, it's not going to mean anything.''

<HEAD>Results of Education Summit, If Any, Won't Show for Long Time</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The true test of a summit conference is what
happens on the way down. That's especially so for pseudo-summits,
called to deal with problems at home rather than to put leaders of
world powers across the table from one another.
   So the grades for President Bush's education summit with the
governors will not be in until next semester. And the results won't
show for a long time after that.
   ``From this day forward, let us be an America of tougher
standards, an America of higher goals and a land of bigger
dreams,'' Bush said after conferring with the governors at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
   They agreed that there should be national standards by which to
judge the performance of schools and their students. Bush also told
the governors he would seek the added flexibility they want in the
use of federal education aid.
   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a leading spokesman on education,
said the success of the summit can be judged on the basis of public
response to the national goals, and ultimately, ``on whether
students learn more.''
   That's the point, of course. With or without national standards,
it is obvious that too many students are not learning enough now,
with a school dropout rate of nearly 30 percent and with an
estimated 23 million illiterate adults.
   Bush said that ``the American people are ready for radical
reforms'' in education. The changes envisioned in the summit sumup
didn't sound radical. They included holding educators accountable
for student performance, keeping drugs out of schools, cutting away
federal and state educational red tape, reducing the dropout rate
and improving literacy.
   The post-summit challenge can hardly be to those common sense
goals. It will be to keep education reform high on the national
agenda. That won't be free, although the president and the
governors carefully avoided debates about more federal spending.
   Clinton said there would have to be more spending later, but the
goals came first.
   ``You can't do it with poetry,'' said Gov. Mario Cuomo of New
York. He and Clinton are among 28 Democratic governors.
   Bush, who has no budget room to spare anyhow, said the focus
should be on results, not resources. ``If anything, hard experience
teaches that we are simply not getting our money's worth in
education,'' he said.
   The administration estimates that local, state and federal
education spending this year will total $353 billion. Secretary of
Education Lauro Cavazos said that is an increase of 24 percent
since 1983. He said about 6 percent of the total is spent from
Washington.
   The education summit itself was a symbol. To underscore Bush's
concern about education, the White House compared it to Franklin D.
Roosevelt's meeting with governors in 1933, when he summoned them
to talk about Depression measures.
   Nowadays, conferring at the summit _ a phrase attributed to
Winston Churchill _ has become a Washington cliche. While Bush was
presiding at the education conference Wednesday and Thursday, the
deficit deal struck at a budget summit last spring was fraying in a
congressional struggle over taxes and spending. As a presidential
candidate, Bush spoke of five different summit meetings, on five
different sets of problems.
   When Churchill proposed a Cold War summit parley, he meant a
meeting among the chiefs of state. That kind of summit has become a
fixture of East-West diplomacy. Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev are to hold their first one late next spring or early
in the summer. Ronald Reagan held five summit meetings with Soviet
leaders.
   That kind of summitry puts faces and personalities behind the
cold issues and hard lines of East-West rivalries. While summit
meetings have eased tensions, delivered treaties and spurred arms
control, they don't always work.
   There were those who said that Nikita S. Khrushchev's misreading
of John F. Kennedy at their 1961 summit led to the miscalculations
that produced the Cuban missile crisis. Dwight D. Eisenhower's
meeting with Khrushchev created what was called ``the spirit of
Camp David,'' but it didn't last. Within the year, the U-2 spy
plane episode led Khrushchev to angrily cancel a 1959 summit in
Paris.
   Agreements signed at diplomatic summits are written on the way
up, not at the top.
   That's not the case at a domestic summit like Bush's meeting
with the governors. There, scripts have to be written during the
drama of the summit itself. So their agreements tend to be broad
ones, with details to be filled in later. But atmosphere is
important, too.
   The education summit delivered a sense of commitment, urgency
and determination to deal with a deepening national problem.
   That's not an answer, but it's a beginning.

   The images of war wrought by Hurricane
Hugo conjured up memories of another devastating time in South
Carolina history when the carcasses of houses dotted the landscape
and the weary mourned for more than their dead.
   ``I feel like my forefathers must have felt at the close of the
War Between the States. I think we lost life as we know it,'' said
W. Jean Woods, a councilman in neighboring Berkeley County.
   ``Our economy has been laid waste. Our land has been laid waste.
We're all emotionally scarred,'' Woods said.
   This time, the villain wasn't an invading army, although
Charleston has suffered its share of natural disaster in its
glorious 319-year history.
   This time a way of life was gone with a wind named Hugo, a
killer that roared across the Caribbean and struck a bulls-eye on
Charleston before it fizzled off the weather radar screens as a
low-pressure system in western Pennsylvania.
   The hurricane and its remnants killed 33 people in the Caribbean
and 29 in the United States, including 18 in South Carolina. The
12th strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in this century,
Hugo caused an estimated $3 billion damage in this state alone.
   Charleston, a jewel of the Old South now with 65,000 residents,
has weathered much since it was founded in 1670. The British
occupied it in the Revolutionary War; the Union bombarded it in the
Civil War.
   The city survived a disastrous fire in 1861 and earthquakes in
1886 and 1893. Now it can add Hugo to its battle flag.
   Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired
by the first state to secede from the Union, fell not to
Confederate cannons but to Hugo's tidal surge. It was swamped by a
17-foot wave, sustained $1 million damage and is under repair.
   ``Charleston just won't ever be the same. When the hurricane
hit, it took a piece of Charleston with it,'' said Renee Lappe, 30.
``It looked like a bomb had been dropped. If you ride in the
streets, it makes you want to cry.''
   In all, 63 buildings in Charleston collapsed and 381 have severe
structural damage, officials said. Four of five structures have
roof damage of some degree.
   Some buildings in Charleston date back to the 1690s. Its
historic district sits on a peninsula that sticks out like a tongue
into its harbor, where a fictional Rhett Butler ran the Union
blockade.
   About 75 percent of the city's 3,500 building considered to be
of historical significance were damaged, including 20 to 30 that
were severely damaged or razed. Then as the second part of a cruel
combination punch, the structures were hit by several inches of
rain two days after Hugo left.
   Damage to those buildings was put in the hundreds of millions of
dollars and could take five years to repair, according to teams of
preservationists who rushed to the city's aid from all over the
country.
   ``We're not destroyed, but we're hurt,'' said Lawrence Walker of
the Historic Charleston Foundation, grateful that the
pastel-colored antebellum mansions weren't subjected to more ruin.
   The mahogany altar at the Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul was
splintered by a stone roof support that crashed down when Hugo
gouged a gaping hole in the roof of the Roman revival structure
built in 1815.
   ``At least the Yankees aren't shooting at us this time,'' said
the Very Rev. Nelson Koscheski.
   As in any battle, there were heroes.
   In McClellanville, a shrimping village of 500 residents in the
Carolina Lowcountry, Hugo unleashed its mightiest tidal surge of 20
feet. The entire town was devastated. Boats 68 feet long were
tossed into yards as if they were toys.
   Thomas Colleton, 57, hoisted his family of nine up to the inner
rafters of his one-story house as waters flooded in and rose up to
his chest as he lifted the children.
   ``I wanted to be the last one (up),'' Colleton said later.
``When you hear a man screaming for help and nobody can help him,
you know it's terrible.''
   ``Lives are just devastated,'' said Jimmy Scott, 45, as he
scraped the muck from his home. ``It's really gone with the wind
this time. Literally. There's nothing to do but pick up the pieces
and start over.''
   Frances Graham, 74, stacked her furniture and furnishings on the
front lawn in an attempt to dry them. Water had surged 10 feet into
the house. A building she had never seen before was dumped in the
back yard.
   ``It was absolute pandemonium,'' Mrs. Graham said ``We may be
scrounging around for food just like Scarlett O'Hara. We just don't
know where to turn.''
   Charleston issued an emergency ordinance to prevent price
gouging on items such as ice and chain saws. A fist fight broke out
in one ice line.
   Some looting was also reported in Myrtle Beach. ``It's like
stealing from a graveyard,'' shopowner Connie Brewer said.
   But for the most part, people quietly picked up the pieces.
   The National Guard enforced a dawn-to-dusk curfew and martial
law was imposed on the Isle of Palms, one of the barrier islands
that absorbed the brunt of Hugo's ferocity.
   After getting his first look at the devastation, Thomas Harper,
a retired Air Force officer, said, ``It looks like what happens
after artillery fire.''
   Some island and coastal residents who may have lost everything
they had to Hugo faced another devastating prospect: a state law
enacted to curb beach erosion may prevent some from rebuilding.
   And more than a week after Hugo roared through, 203,000 people
were without power, most of them in the Charleston area.
Storm-battered residents coped without electricity, without hot
water for showers, without ways to cook hot food as convoys of
electrical workers strung new power lines.
   They queued up for meals, canned food, ice, air mattresses, gas
lanterns, shoes and clothes at distribution points.
   ``This will keep us alive,'' said a grateful Fesella Ladson, 25,
of Charleston, carrying a cardboard box filled with emergency
supplies.
   The American Red Cross mounted a $42 million relief effort, the
most expensive relief effort in its 126-year history.
   Supplies poured in from around the country, but folks in the
rural areas felt the recovery moved glacier-like.
   Mayor Hazel Parson-Starkes of Ridgeville blamed Hugo for ``the
worst devastation in any of our lives.''
   ``We have no food, water, power or anything. We're pleading for
all the help we can get. I just don't know how we're going to get
through this.''
   Hugo's fury recalled the age-old awe of Caribbean Indians who
bowed before a god of wind named Hurrican.
   In South Carolina, its brute energy created incongruous scenes:
boats blown a half-mile inland, roofs sheared off, trees twisted
into spaghetti-like heaps.
   ``It really rattled us to our roots,'' said Dr. Linda Austin of
the Medical University of South Carolina.
   Somehow, people began rebuilding their homes and their lives.
Some in Charleston found a force more indomitable than the guns of
armies or nature's mightiest forces.
   Kris Holmes waited patiently for a leasing company to put the
roof back on her business, Terrible Tom's Pastry Shop. She hoped to
reopen soon.
   ``It's the spirit of Charleston,'' she said. ``We're survivors.''

   Drained by losses of more than $1 million a week,
Braniff Inc. became the first major airline to seek bankruptcy
protection a second time after canceling nearly all its flights and
laying off more than half its work force.
   Some airline experts say a cash shortage and intense competition
from larger carriers may keep Braniff from re-enacting its comeback
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1984 as a smaller company.
   Braniff left thousands of travelers seeking alternate flights
and ticket refunds Thursday as it halted all but four flights
linking its Kansas City hub with Dallas and Orlando, Fla., its home

   The House approved President Bush's proposed
cut in capital-gains taxes, rejecting arguments of Democratic
leaders that it would bring a windfall for the rich at the expense
of a bigger budget deficit.
   A nearly solid bloc of Republicans was joined by 64 Democrats,
chiefly from timber and farm areas, in Thursday's 239-190 vote to
redeem Bush's campaign promise to tax investment income at a lower
rate than wages.
   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the proposal would cut
taxes for 8 million couples and individuals, with 80 percent of the
benefit going to those with total yearly incomes above $100,000.

   Viacom International Inc. says it has reached a
``watershed'' in its financial health with a debt restructuring
that gives the entertainment company more money, lower interest
costs and fewer restrictions.
   Viacom owns MTV, Showtime, The Movie Channel and distribution
rights to ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``A Different
World'' as well as 14 cable TV systems, five television stations
and eight radio stations.
   Viacom is 83 percent owned by National Amusements Inc., a
Dedham, Mass., movie theater chain that bought its stake for $460
million in cash and $2.8 billion in new and old debt in a leveraged
buyout in 1987.
   The New York-based company said Thursday the refinancing was
made possible by an increase in the value of its assets and the
flow of cash from its operations, marking the success of the buyout.
   The 10-year agreement with its bank lenders, led by Citibank
with Bank of New York as co-agent, gives it up to $1.5 billion in
unsecured bank loans and revolving credit. It does not have to pay
any principal for three years.
   The agreement permits the company to borrow an additional $500
million by issuing commercial paper backed up by a portion of the
bank lending. Viacom will use part of the proceeds to retire $200
million of its $1.3 billion in outstanding junk bonds.
   ``The closing of this credit agreement is a watershed event for
our company,'' Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman, and Frank J.
Biondi Jr., the president and chief executive, said in a joint
statement.
   ``By terminating our old credit agreement we have left behind
the restrictiveness of the LBO structure and have put in place a
more flexible capitalization,'' they said.
   The new agreement frees Viacom to issue more debt, which could
be used for acquisitions. Spokesman Thomas Dooley said the company
has not announced any plans, but added, ``We do remain
opportunistic.''

   A major toy retailer is voluntarily recalling
11,000 baby rattles because parts of the toy may become detached
and choke young children, a government agency said.
   The ``Wooden Shaky Head Rattles'' were sold nationwide for about
$2 each in 1988 and 1989 by Toys `R' Us, Inc.
   The toy consists of a six and one-half inch wooden handle topped
with a red, yellow, pink or black head-shaped rattle which has
springs hanging from each side. Attached to the springs are two
small wooden balls.
   The rattle ``fails to meet the Consumer Product Safety
Commission mandatory standard for rattles that is intended to
prevent choking accidents involving young children,'' Anne Graham,
the panel's acting chairwoman, said Thursday.
   Consumers should take the rattles away from children and return
them to the nearest Toys `R' Us store for a refund, the commission
said.
   Graham said there had been no reported injuries associated with
the toy but the recall was being made as a preventive action.

   Stock speculator Ivan Boesky secretly
tape-recorded three conversations with indicted junk bond financier
Michael Milken in 1986 shortly before Boesky was publicly named as
a government informant, court documents reveal.
   The nature of the discussions was not disclosed and prosecutors
and defense lawyers on Thursday declined to discuss their content.
But the tapes could emerge as critical evidence in the Milken's
scheduled March 1990 trial on fraud and racketeering charges.
   The tape recordings, made on Oct. 1, Oct. 9 and Nov. 6, 1986,
were mentioned in a letter from the government to lawyers
representing Milken. The letter was attached to a recent filing in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   The final recorded conversation occurred just eight days before
the revelation that Boesky made a deal to cooperate with
prosecutors in their probe of Wall Street corruption.
   Milken, the former head of junk bond operations for Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., was indicted in March on 98 counts of fraud
and racketeering for an alleged series of schemes with Boesky.
   Boesky in November 1986 agreed to plead guilty to one criminal
count of filing false information with the government and is
serving a three-year jail term.
   His stock dealings with Milken formed the basis of much of
Milken's indictment, principally a $5.3 million payment from Boesky
to Drexel to settle the balance in what the government calls a
secret arrangement involving insider trading, tax fraud, rigged
corporate takeovers and other violations.
   It was known that Boesky secretly tape-recorded conversations
after he was recruited as an informant but the identities of those
he tape-recorded had not been disclosed previously. Boesky was
first implicated in the spring of 1986 by investment banker Dennis
Levine and he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors some time that
summer.
   If the tapes contain damaging information about Milken, they
could strengthen the government's case. But if Milken said nothing
incriminating despite attempts by Boesky to trap him, it could help
the defense.
   Tape recordings were not mentioned in the government's
indictment of Milken and two others. The government has said a
broader indictment is expected in the next month.
   The April 24 letter detailing the tapes was attached to a recent
filing by the government as part of the discovery process in the
case, in which prosecutors are required to inform the defense of
documents and other evidence gathered.
   The letter said the Oct. 9 conversation was recorded on two
cassettes while the others were recorded on one tape.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll declined to discuss the
tapes.
   Milken attorney Arthur Liman said in a statement released by a
spokesman for Milken: ``As we've said in the past, we will not try
this case in the press, and we look forward to a full hearing in
court.''
   In an internal Securities and Exchange Commission memo, the
contents of which were published by The Washington Post earlier
this month, the government said Boesky and Milken met in July 1986
to substantiate the ``consulting services'' explanation allegedly
used to conceal the true nature of the $5.3 million payment.

   The U.S. dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen
during morning trading Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange edged up slightly.
   The dollar was changing hands at 139.50 yen, down 1.35 yen from
Thursday's close of 140.85 yen, at late morning. After opening
lower at 140.60 yen, the currency ranged from 139.20 to 140.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
319.41 points Thursday, added 19.86 points, or 0.05 percent,
closing the morning session at 35,709.84, a new high.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was pushed further down by
coordinated intervention by the Japanese, U.S. and British central
banks.
   It was the Bank of Japan's fifth consecutive day of intervention
in the Tokyo market. The intervention began Monday, when central
banks from other nations stepped into the market to join in
bringing the dollar down, dealers said.
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its intervention policy,
but it was reported to have sold $200 million during Friday's
morning trading, according to Kyodo News Service.
   Central bank intervention also has taken place on overseas
markets following Saturday's meeting in Washington of the Group of
Seven industrialized countries.
   The G-7 nations _ Japan, the United States, Britain, West
Germany, France, Italy and Candada _ agreed to cooperate closely in
foreign exchange markets.
   ``Well, I can say that intervention with other countries is
producing a good effect,'' Japan's Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto told a news conference Friday morning.
   But Hashimoto refused to specify on what exchange rates might be
appropriate in light of the dollar's recent surge agaist the yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index continued to edge up,
encouraged by the yen's continued rise against the dollar,
securities dealers said.
   A higher yen should make Japanese products more expensive in
overseas markets and imports of foreign goods cheaper in Japan,
thus helping to reduce the nation's huge trade surplus.

<TEXT>
   Plans for increased cooperation with the United
States in space exploration could be a boon to Japan's fledgling
aerospace industries, analysts say.
   During a six-day visit to Tokyo that ended Tuesday, U.S. Vice
President Dan Quayle made space cooperation a top priority in
forging a ``global partnership'' with Japan, beginning with the
international ``Freedom'' space station and a project to measure
effects of solar radiation on Earth's magnetic field.
   Quayle said both sides were considering possible Japanese
collaboration in a new U.S. initiative for space exploration that
would put a permanent observatory on the moon and send a manned
mission to Mars.
   Japanese leaders welcomed Quayle's enthusiastic support for
international cooperation in space, a rare area in which Japan lags
far behind the United States and Europe in terms of both technology
and spending.
   Partly due to prohibitions imposed by the United States after
World War II, Japan is a latecomer to the aerospace field. It has
relied heavily on foreign technology and, while active in
development of rockets and satellites, has no independent manned
space program.
   This summer, as the U.S. National Space Council, chaired by
Quayle, began mapping out a new U.S. era in space, Japan was
drafting a 10-year space program to develop an unmanned space plane
in the next decade and eventually to send its own astronauts into
space aboard Japanese-made spacecraft.
   The program also calls for basic research on robots capable of
assembling and repairing satellites in orbit and for developing a
rocket capable of lifting commercial payloads into orbit.
   Constitutional limits on Japan's military, which have slowed
defense-related research, and low government spending have been
major handicaps for Japan's space program.
   Concerned that U.S. restrictions on security-sensitive and
advanced technology could close the technology pipeline, Japan has
begun channeling more funds into space research, although spending
remains far below that of the United States.
   In 1989, Japan is spending $1.1 billion on its space programs,
compared with $9 billion dollars spent by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration alone in 1988.
   Without a substantial increase in commercial spinoffs from
military and other government-sponsored space research, Japan is
unlikely, however, to develop a profitable, competitive space
program in the foreseeable future, says Stephen E. Marvin, an
analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. in Tokyo.
   ``The Japanese space industry is tiny. In terms of actual
potential I don't see the emergence of an independent and
commercially viable aerospace industry anytime soon,'' Martin said.
   Quayle said during his visit to the Tsukuba Space Center east of
Tokyo that instead of fearing competition from Japan in space, the
United States hoped Japan could help defray the huge cost of space
exploration. He said U.S. charges that Japan is not buying enough
American-made satellites should not interfere with overall
cooperation in space science.
   Japan faces possible retaliation under U.S. ``Super 301'' trade
legislation if it is judged to be unfairly discriminating against
the U.S.-made satellites.
   While Japan would like to have a strong space industry, it is
more likely to join international programs that dilute risk while
facilitating technology transfers.
   ``Japan wants to have its own indigenous technology, but the
risks involved in space development are enormous,'' Martin said.
   Aerospace could become Japan's only truly international
industry, says analyst Keith Donaldson of James Capel and Co.
   ``In the past all (Japanese) manufacturing was originally
domestic, and that created trade problems,'' said Donaldson. The
Ministry of International Trade and Industry ``wants to use
aerospace to internationalize Japan,'' he said.
   To international projects, Japan can contribute superior
electronics technology, particularly in radar and visual imaging as
well as the powerful computer chips needed in sophisticated
aerospace equipment, Martin said.
   Japan is trying to develop its own industry for commercial
launches of satellites, a step that requires upgrading old
technology borrowed from the United States to develop a rocket able
to launch heavier payloads. Its payloads for a geostationary orbit
currently are limited to 1,200 pounds.
   To be competitive, Japan must have a rocket capable of handling
at least 2,000 pounds. But Japanese researchers have run into
technical problems that have delayed the launch of the next
generation H-2 rocket by at least one year, officials say.
   Japan also needs to find another location for satellite
launches, says Donaldson. Its equivalent of Cape Canaveral in
Florida is the Tanegashima Space Center on a small island off the
southern coast.
   The Tanegashima facility has been expanded to accommodate the
H-2 rocket program, but an agreement with local fishermen restricts
launches to a 45-day period in the summer and another 45-day period
in the winter, limiting both experimental progress and future
commercial launches.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Launches New Low-Smoke Cigarette</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who worry about irritating non-smokers
with their cigarettes are targets for the latest tobacco product
from Philip Morris USA.
   The nation's largest cigarette maker announced the national
launch Thursday of a cigarette that it says emits 70 percent less
smoke from the lighted end than most comparable brands.
   The cigarette, called Superslims from Virginia Slims, also is
very low in tar and slimmer in shape than most other 100 millimeter
cigarettes, the company said. The principal buyers are expected to
be women.
   Philip Morris, maker of the Marlboro, Benson &amp; Hedges and Merit
brands, already is the leader in the estimated $40 billion U.S.
cigarette market with an estimated 41 percent market share. But
overall cigarette sales have been declining at about a 2.5 percent
rate for several years.
   Industry analysts said the new cigarette continues that market's
trend of offering products that appeal to narrowly defined groups _
in this case women and people concerned about offending non-smokers
with their cigarettes.
   ``This is a business based on segmentation,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, who follows the tobacco business for the investment firm
PaineWebber Inc.
   Cutting down on so-called ``sidestream'' smoke has become a more
important concern to cigarette makers who face an increasingly
hostile regulatory environment.
   Superslims emit less smoke from the lit end than most other
brands because of a double wrapping of porous and non-porous
papers, Philip Morris said. The wrapping does not affect the amount
of smoke which the smoker inhales, however.
   David E.R. Dangoor, vice president for marketing at Philip
Morris, said the low-smoke feature was something ``a lot of smokers
will find to be an advantage'' as social pressures continue to
build against smoking.
   But he said Superslims' main attraction is that it combines in
one cigarette all three features _ low smoke, low tar and extra
slimness _ that are currently found only individually in other
brands.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., for instance, since early this year
has been testing Vantage Excel 100s, which it says emits less smoke
from the lit end than other 100-millimeter cigarettes.
   A number of cigarette brands, including Virginia Slims Ultra
Lights, match or have lower levels of tar than the 6 milligrams in
Superslims.
   And Brown &amp; Williamson Co., another leading tobacco company, has
been selling an extra slim brand called Capri since 1987. It filed
a patent infringement suit against Philip Morris last May in U.S.
District Court in Louisville in an effort to head off the
introduction of Superslims. The suit is pending.
   Both Capri and Superslims have a circumference of 17 millimeters
compared with 23 millimeters for Virginia Slims and 25 millimeters
for regular brands.
   Cigarette companies frequently test new brands in a few markets
before launching them nationally, but Philip Morris, a division of
Philip Morris Cos. Inc., said it was bypassing the test market
because of the positive reaction women smokers had to Superslims in
interviews.
   Dangoor refused to say how much Philip Morris planned to spend
marketing the cigarettes, but said it would be an ``extremely
ambitious'' mix of print, outdoor and point-of-purchase ads,
couponing, direct mail and promotions.
   In one ad planned for magazines next month, two pairs of women's
fingers are shown holding burning cigarettes _ one pair holds one
of the ``leading 100s'' emiting a heavy curl of smoke while the
other holds a Superslims with only a wisp of smoke.
   Dangoor said the new cigarettes are totally unrelated to the
so-called smokeless cigarette called Premier which Reynolds
discontinued earlier this year after a disastrous run of several
months in test markets. Premier used a burning carbon element to
heat tobacco without burning it.
   ``This is a real cigarette that burns tobacco,'' Dangoor said of
Superslims.

<HEAD>Sony Agrees to Buy Guber-Peters Entertainment, May Find Role at Columbia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. has agreed to buy the moviemaker
Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. Inc. and indicated its owners would
be offered roles at another prospective Sony operation, Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   Sony said Thursday it agreed to pay $17.50 a share, or $200
million, for Guber-Peters, the Hollywood company headed by
producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters that counts the movie hits
``Batman'' and ``Rain Man'' among its credits.
   Including Guber-Peters' debt that Sony will inherit, the deal is
valued at $240 million.
   The move came a day after Sony, the Japanese electronics giant,
took its biggest step into the ``software'' side of the
entertainment business by agreeing to pay $3.4 billion for New
York-based Columbia Pictures.
   A potential snag to the deal developed Thursday, however, when
three Columbia shareholders filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County
Superior Court attempting to block the takeover.
   The suit, filed by shareholders Elfriede Glancy, Linda Zelden
and Melvyn Zupnick, accused Columbia's board of directors of
settling for an offer from Sony that was far less than what the
company is worth. It asks that the board be ordered to cooperate
with others seeking to buy the company.
   A Sony spokesman in Tokyo, Tom Sugiyama, said the suit was a
matter between Columbia and its shareholders and that Sony had no
other comment.
   The purchase of Guber-Peters dramatizes Sony's eagerness to
shore up Columbia's floundering film production.
   Guber-Peters has a tangible net worth of just $2 a share,
according to Michael Tennenbaum, vice chairman of investment
banking for Bear, Stearns and Co., which appraised the Sony offer
for the Guber-Peters board.
   But the company has much greater intrinsic value, Tennenbaum
said, because of its television assets, future profit payoffs from
``Batman'' and, most important, because of its ``management and
track record.'' Guber and Peters are considered to be two of
Hollywood's hottest producers.
   In announcing that its board agreed to the deal with Sony,
Columbia said its president and chief executive, Victor A. Kaufman,
and its chief operating officer, Lewis J. Korman, had indicated
they intended to ``move on to other endeavors'' before any deal was
completed.
   There have been published reports that Guber would be asked to
replace Kaufman at Columbia once the acquisition is completed.
   Kaufman and Guber failed to respond to repeated requests for
comment.
   Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, also
declined to comment directly on those reports Thursday.
   But he said in a telephone interview, ``We are hopeful that the
management of Guber-Peters will work out some of their existing
contractual arrangements in a way that will make it possible for
them to join Columbia Pictures.''
   Guber and Peters recently renewed a five-year production
contract with Columbia rival Warner Bros., and are working on a
``Batman'' sequel due in 1991 and film adaptations of the books
``Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ``A Bright Shining Lie'' for Warner.
   Rights to those films are owned by Warner Bros., and it is
conceivable that Guber-Peters might still make them for the rival
studio. Columbia would benefit by receiving a share of the film's
profits through Guber-Peters.
   A spokesman for Warner, Rob Friedman, declined comment on the
contracts with Guber and Peters.
   The two producers have worked together for years and industry
executives said it was unlikely that one of them would take a role
at Columbia without the other.
   Two years ago, Guber and Peters merged their privately-held
production company with Barris Industries, which made ``The Gong
Show,'' among other TV programs.
   In the fiscal year ended May 31, Guber-Peters lost $19.2 million
on revenue of $23.7 million. The company has yet to realize any
profits from either the Academy Award-winning ``Rain Man'' or
``Batman,'' one of Hollywood's most successful films.
   Sony said it intended to begin a tender offer for all of
Guber-Peters' shares next week. That is also when it intends to
begin its tender offer of $27 a share for Columbia.
   Also on Thursday, Columbia reported it earned $13.0 million, or
10 cents a share, in the three months ended Aug. 31, up from 6.2
million, or 4 cents a share a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue
rose to $453.4 million from $373.1 million a year earlier.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Columbia said it
earned $15.0 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with $10.5
million, or 7 cents a share, a year earlier. Six month revenue rose
to $804.5 million from $783.6 million.

   A series of coordinated central bank interventions
this week contributed to reducing the value of the dollar against
the Japanese yen, dealers said today.
   The dollar closed at 139.35 yen today, down 1.50 yen from
Thursday's finish.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, continued its
pattern of dollar-selling begun on Monday following the weekend
meeting in Washington of group of seven (G-7) nations.
   The G-7 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to closely
cooperate by checking the dollar's rise. The G-7 comprises Japan,
the United States, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
   ``Coordinated intervention produced a result,'' said Naoto
Kawamura, a senior dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   In the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 319.41 points Thursday for a record-high
closing of 35,689.98, shed 53.22 points, or 0.14 percent, closing
the week at 35,634.76.
   Volume traded on the first section totaled 900 million shares,
compared with 1 billion shares traded Thursday.
   The Nikkei index gained a total of 864.97 points this week.

   Something is happening to herbs. They're no
longer just for gourmet cooks and snooty restaurants, says
Agriculture Department economist Cathy Greene.
   From the well-known garlic clove to jasmine and foxglove, herbs
are used for such diverse purposes as cooking, landscaping, bridal
wreaths and aromatherapy.
   According to recently released 1987 census of agriculture
estimates, there has been a dramatic increase in U.S. herb farming,
Greene said. The acreage rose 122 percent between 1982 and 1987 and
the quantity harvested jumped 248 percent.
   Greene, writing in the October issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said food service and retail suppliers are enlarging
their herb-growing operations and are building new high-tech
packing houses to handle the crops.
   The International Herb Growers and Marketers Association, for
example, has more than doubled its membership from 450 only three
years ago to 1,050 today.
   But Greene, who works for the department's Economic Research
Service, added Thursday in a telephone interview that no, herbs
aren't about to crowd wheat and soybeans off the charts, at least
not yet.
   Aromatherapy is something new in the scent world. Greene said
it's hard to define satisfactorily, but it has to do with
fragrances affecting human well-being and attitudes. Something like
that.
   ``We know that use of fresh culinary herbs has skyrocketed,''
she said. ``But right now there's no way to get a good estimate of
their total value.''
   Why the herb surge? One reason is the availability. Herbs
garnish produce counters virtually in every supermarket.
   ``Instead of having to go to a restaurant and having them served
to you, where they have made special arrangements to get herbs,
having them available at grocery stores has made a difference,''
Greene said.
   Sometimes herbs can be marketed through several channels. For
example, both fresh and dried rosemary is available at some
supermarkets. And it's also sold as a potted plant at herb garden
nurseries. Farm markets often carry rosemary wreaths during the
winter.
   Garlic is also sold for cooking, as a dietary supplement, and is
braided with dried flowers for sale as decorations by upscale
kitchen boutiques and farmers' markets. It's supposed to ward off
vampires, too.
   Feverfew is used in herbal landscaping design, and some medical
reports suggest it may be effective in preventing migraine
headaches.
   Other examples cited by Greene include jasmine, which is used in
teas as well as high-grade perfumes, and foxglove used as an
ornamental plant and in the cardiovascular drug digitalis.
   According to a 1989 consumer survey by The Packer, an industry
publication, the top five fresh herbs in consumer recognition are
garlic, 95 percent of those questioned; parsley, 86 percent; dill,
67 percent; chives, 66 percent; and ginger root, 59 percent.
   More than half of those surveyed had seen or heard of fresh
basil, while a third or more had seen or heard of fresh mint,
horseradish, oregano, sage, thyme, rosemary and anise. Twenty-seven
percent recognized cilantro and marjoram.
   Herb-growing operations range from hobby farmers and back yard
nurseries in cities to open-air farms with more than several
hundred acres.
   According to the 1987 agricultural census, California leads in
garlic and parsley acreage, while Hawaii is the only U.S. producer
of ginger root. Washington state leads in dill acreage, and Oregon
has the most mint.
   California is also the top producer of ``all other'' herbs, a
category that includes fresh culinary herbs such as basil, chives,
thyme and rosemary.
   Wisconsin is the largest producer of herbs in an ``aggregate''
category, Greene said. Most of Wisconsin's herb acreage, however,
is for cultivated ginseng, not for culinary herbs. Most of the crop
is exported to Asian countries, where ginseng is used as a medicine.
   Meanwhile, imports of fresh herbs are also up, she said. These
shipments are used both for fresh market sales and in food
processing.
   Total imports of 17 herbs shipped fresh to the United States
increased to 14 million pounds in 1987, up 6 percent from 1986 and
22 percent more than in 1985. The largest imports, in order, were
garlic, cilantro, ginger root, oregano and parsley.

<HEAD>Exchange Officials Testify on Market Reform Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposed market reform legislation to
strengthen the Securities and Exchange Commission has met with at
least partial approval from the nation's top stock market officials.
   The presidents of the New York Stock Exchange, the American
Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers
told a House subcommittee Thursday that they favored most or all of
the four key points proposed in the Stock Market Reform Act of 1989.
   Also testifying before the subcommittee was the president of the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, who said introduction of a hand-held
computer to record trades on the nation's two largest futures
exchanges is at least a year away.
   CME President William J. Brodsky said the exchange and the
Chicago Board of Trade were spending ``$5 million just for
development'' of the computerized record-keeping system, proposed
in the wake of a wave of indictments for alleged massive fraud
schemes by traders and brokers on both futures exchanges.
   The market reform bill was proposed in the wake of the 1987
stock market crash, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
more than 500 points. It would grant the SEC authority to halt
securities trading for up to 24 hours in an emergency situation,
described as ``a major market disturbance.''
   NYSE President Richard A. Grasso and Amex President Kenneth R.
Leibler approved of that idea, but the NASD's Joseph R. Hardiman
said he opposed trading halts.
   ``As a general principle, we think that markets should strive to
remain open under all market conditions, to provide the liquidity
and price discovery on which individual and institutional investors
rely,'' he said in a prepared statement that accompanied his
tesimony.
   ``The fact that the markets remained open and functioning,
although not perfectly, during the market break of October 1987
probably averted a much more serious financial crisis,'' continued
the statement by the NASD, which oversees the over-the-counter
stock market.
   Hardiman joined the two exchange officials in supporting another
aspect of the bill that called for the SEC, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve Board to link or
coordinate their facilities for clearing and settling trades in
securities, options, futures contracts and other transactions.
   But Hardiman said he also had questions about two other points
of the bill: new requirements for reporting large stock trades and
rules for assessing the financial soundness of holding companies
that are the parent companies of broker-dealers.
   The others disagreed with him, however, when Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass. asked, ``Should we be concerned about the stability
of securities firms which have accepted large bridge loans?''
   Traditionally, a bridge loan is a short-term loan in
anticipation of long-term financing. But in the recent wave of
leveraged buyouts, mergers and takeovers, investment banks that
make bridge loans frequently cover their own risk exposure by
selling high-yield junk bonds.
   The junk bond market, weakened by the credit troubles of
Canadian retailing giant Campeau Corp. last week, has scared off
investors and raised concerns on Capitol Hill that would stick Wall
Street investment banks with big loans they might have trouble
refinancing.
   In light of published reports of losses of as much as $20
million to $30 million in the junk bond market, Grasso told Markey,
chairman of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, ``I think it's an area that is
well worth our continuing focus and certainly from the point of
view measuring the ability to assess risk, it is absolutely
critical that we have that we have that provision in your bill.''
   Liebler agreed, saying ``there may well be situations in which
the financial viability of a broker-dealer cannot be fully gauged
without'' such a risk assessment.

<HEAD>Labor Upbeat About Change in Management at Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor leaders welcomed Alfred Checchi's
emergence as chairman of NWA Inc., even though the change came
sooner than many expected and in the face of defections from top
management ranks.
   Checchi, 41, led a $3.65 billion buyout of Northwest Airlines'
parent in June. On Thursday the carrier said Chairman Steven
Rothmeier resigned for personal reasons after holding the position
since 1986. Four other top executives also resigned.
   ``I suspect that Mr. Checchi was surprised by the
resignations,'' said Northwest spokesman Alan Muncaster.
   Muncaster said Checchi was informed Wednesday of the
resignations, which will take effect Oct. 15. Before Wednesday, the
Los Angeles investor had repeatedly said he wanted Rothmeier to
continue as chairman.
   Checchi named Frederic Malek as president to replace president
and chief operating officer John Horn. Malek and Checchi will split
the chief executive duties previously handled by Rothmeier,
Muncaster said.
   Also resigning from the airline were Benjamin G. Griggs Jr.,
executive vice president of NWA Companies, Allan Pray, executive
vice president-international, and William Sitter, executive vice
president-administration and chief information officer.
   None could be reached for comment Thursday.
   James Cronin, former president and chief executive officer of
Tiger International, was named executive vice president and
chairman of NWA companies, including the Northwest Aerospace
Training Corp., MLT Vacations and Northwest Aircraft Inc.
   ``I'm getting reports from membership that it's a pretty
positive move,'' said Guy Cook, chairman of the International
Association of Machinists District Lodge 143, the carrier's largest
union.
   Cook said any rift between Rothmeier and Checchi could include
differing views of labor. He said Rothmeier inherited a byzantine
outlook from predecessors Donald Nyrop and M. Joseph Lapensky.
Nyrop is legendary for removing doors from the toilet stalls in the
employee wash rooms at Northwest to discourage lengthy bathroom
breaks.
   ``I think Checchi has given clear indications that he wishes to
change the direction of management-labor relations,'' Cook said.
   Jim Halvorson, a spokesman for the local unit of the Air Line
Pilots Association, said he had expected Rothmeier's team to stay
in place up to a year after the buyout. But he, too, welcomed new
management.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who is reviewing
the buyout, had no warning of the resignations, Muncaster said. He
said it was too early to tell what impact the change will have on
Skinner's review.
   Muncaster said there was no indication that Checchi's
chairmanship would be temporary. Management by Checchi and Malek
``would definitely be hands-on,'' he added.
   Cook said the split was inevitable because Rothmeier was
accustomed to reporting to a docile board of directors. Since June,
Rothmeier has had to answer to Checchi, a former Marriott Corp.
executive who also worked as a dealmaker for the Bass brothers of
Texas.
   ``When you have two very strong-willed egos butting heads at
that level, you know it won't last long,'' Cook said.
   Neither Checchi nor Malek has airline experience, but both
worked for Marriott, which has close ties to the industry. In
addition, Malek was a finalist in December 1987 for the top job at
United Airlines. Malek, a merchant banker from Washington, D.C.,
also worked on the staff of former President Richard Nixon and was
an investor in Checchi's buyout group.
   U.S. Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the House
aviation subcommittee, said the change at Northwest was necessary
to improve the company's ``prickly labor-management relations.''
   Rothmeier oversaw the 1986 acquisition of Republic Airlines and
led management's fight against a hostile takeover bid of Northwest
launched early this year by oil billionaire Marvin Davis. The
takeover battled ended in June when Checchi's group completed its
all-cash buyout of the carrier for $121 a share. Rothmeier said at
the time that he considered Rothmeier's group to be friendly.

   Stock prices were lower at midday Friday, but the

from its lowest levels.
   Shares got off to a weak start as fears swept the market that
the British government would raise interest rates to shore up the

midmorning.
   Traders breathed a sign of relief once the quarterly futures and

   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index

<TEXT>
   AVX Corp., an electronics concern,
will be acquired by Kyocera Corp. of Japan in a stock-swap deal
valued at $561 million, company officials said.
   The deal, which will give control of AVX to Kyoto, Japan-based
Kyocera, will have little affect on AVX's day-to-day operations.
AVX Executive Vice President Benedict Rosen said Thursday that ``it
is the intention of (Kyocera) to operate as we are today.''
   The move is being called one of the first between an American
and Japanese company strictly involving stock.
   The news sent AVX's stock surging $8 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange Thursday, where it closed at $29.62{.
   AVX manufactures passive electronic components called capacitors
for the military, aerospace and telecommunications fields and had
sales of roughly $409 million in 1988.
   Kyocera makes technical ceramics for semi-conductors, optical
instruments and electronic equipment and had more than $2.5 billion
in sales during the fiscal year ending March 31.
   Analysts said the merger was part of streamlining in the
technology industry. Hugh Martin of Interstate Johnson Lane said
the deal could give AVX enough financial backing to expand local
facilities.
   AVX had purchased four competitors in less than two years of
expansion moves. About half of Kyocera's business is conducted
overseas, and the merger enhances its global position, company
chairman Kazuo Inamori said in a news release.
   Under terms of the deal, each share of AVX would be exchanged
for 0.39 Kyocera American depositary receipts. The ADRs represent
two shares of Kyocera common stock.
   Shareholders and various U.S. and Japanese regulatory agencies
must approve the merger before it is completed. AVX has called a
special shareholders meeting in December.
   But analysts predicted there could be a fight for federal
approval.
   Eric Long of Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., said, ``Other capacitor
makers are probably going to fight the deal. Look at the past
several years, they've fought the Japanese. And there's a good
chance for the politicians to jump in.''

   Thirty-one Boeing airliners valued at about $1
billion have been ordered by the Lufthansa Group of companies,
Boeing Commercial Airplanes confirmed Thursday.
   Lufthansa Leasing, a new leasing company, ordered eight 757s.
Condor, the wholly owned subsidiary airline, ordered three more of

757s already on order.
   Lufthansa German Airlines ordered 20 of Boeing's 737s. The first
six will be the -300 series, with delivery to begin in May 1991.
The remaining 14 will be the smaller -500, to be delivered later.
   Lufthansa already has 20 of the 737-500s on order with delivery
to begin in October 1990.
   Lufthansa, including Condor, is Boeing's largest airline
customer outside the United States. It has ordered 291 Boeing
jetliners since 1956.
   Boeing orders for 1989 reached 736 aircraft with the Lufthansa

<HEAD>States Propose Settlement in Suit Against Visa, MasterCard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A settlement offer is on the table in an
antitrust lawsuit that alleged Visa and Mastercard conspired to
undermine the competition in developing a national debit card.
   A debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card, but
the money is automatically deducted from the cardholder's account
and transferred to the merchant.
   The settlement proposal was made Thursday by Lloyd Costantine,
chief of the antitrust unit of the state attorney general's office
in New York, on behalf of the 13 states that sued Visa and
Mastercard
   The suit, filed June 26 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
charged that Visa and Mastercard tried to undermine the competition
by gaining control of the nation's two largest automatic teller
machine networks.
   The two networks, Cirrus System Inc. of Downers Grove., Ill.,
and Plus System Inc. of Denver, had been formulating their own
plans for national debit card networks in the early and mid-1980s.
   Visa also took over the Interlink Network, based in San Mateo,
Calif., the nation's largest regional debit card network.
   The lawsuit also charged that in 1987, Visa and Mastercard
formed a joint venture called Entree to develop the debit card but
purposely dragged their feet on the plan.
   In the settlement proposal, the states offered to drop their
efforts to compel Visa and Mastercard to divest Cirrus, Plus and
Interlink. In return, Visa and Mastercard would drop the Entree
venture.
   Costantine said the settlement would allow Visa or MasterCard to
separately develop a national debit card.
   However, he said, the states want a provision people who are
credit cardholders of both Visa and MasterCard to have debit
accounts with only one of the companies.
   The other states that filed suit were California, Connecticut,
Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas,
Utah, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Costantine said the states decided to offer a settlement because
Entree was not yet on the market and because they felt the
companies had no intention of putting the national debit card in
operation.
   Barry Brett, the attorney for Visa, and Stanley Robinson,
MasterCard's lawyer, said they would discuss the settlement offer
with the states. The two companies are to respond to the lawsuit on
Nov. 6.

<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge rose 0.3 percent in August, its second consecutive advance,
indicating continued growth in the months ahead, the Commerce
Department reported today.
   The increase in the Index of Leading Indicators, designed to
foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future,
followed a 0.1 percent gain in July. It declined 0.1 percent in
June.
   Today's index reinforced recent government and private industry
reports indicating that the nation's longest peacetime economic
expansion will reach its seventh birthday in December.
   ``I think if we're going to have a recession it probably won't
start before then and I still think we will squeeze through 1990
without one,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser at
the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``But it won't be very buoyant
growth.''
   So far this year, the leading indicators have bounced back and
forth _ up in January, April, July and August, and down in
February, March, May and June. In the past, three consecutive
declines sometimes, but not always, have signaled a forthcoming
recession.
   ``This trendless result for 1989 seems consistent with the slow
growth experience of the overall economy,'' said Ysabel Burns
McAleer of the American Financial Services Association.
   Five of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make up
the composite index contributed to the August gain _ an increase in
manufacturers' new orders, higher stock prices, an increase in the
money supply, lower inital unemployment claims and increased
building permits.
   The others pointed down _ a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence; lower prices for sensitive meaterials, indicating
slower demand; a decrease in manufactuers' unfilled orders; fewer
orders for plants and equipment; faster vendor deliveries, meaning
declining demand and a shorter workweek.
   The various changes left the index at 144.4 percent of its 1982
base of 100. So far this year, the index has risen at an annual
rate of 3.8 percent, compared with an increase of 4.5 percent for
all of 1988.
   The economy has been growing steadily since November 1982 when
the nation came out of its last recession, but many thought it
might be pushed into another downturn this year by Federal Reserve
efforts to slow inflation.
   Beginning in March 1988, the Fed gradually tightened the
nation's credit supply. It's goal became known as the
``soft-landing'' _ continued, but slower economic growth to keep
inflationary pressures in rein.
   Some economists, like David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
New York government securities dealer, try to avoid the
``soft-landing'' description.
   ``The term is so overused that I hate to use it,'' Jones said.
``In some sense, it's not a landing story at all. It's an economy
that's growing at lower altitude of GNP (gross national product)
growth than we saw last year.''
   The lower altitude is reflected in several recent reports by
government and private economists.
   The Fed's latest survey of conditions around the country, for
instance, found the economy continuing the grow at the midpoint of
the third quarter at a pace ranging from slow to moderate,
depending on region.
   And the National Association of Business Economists on Monday
released a report saying nearly two-thirds of the 72 forecasting
experts it surveyed said they think a recession is not likely
before 1991. A third of those said another recession will not
arrive until 1992 or later.
   It was a dramatic reversal from a NABE survey last February
which found 75 percent of the participants expected a recession
this year or next.

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Merv Griffin has a
license to run a casino, but it came with a lecture from regulators
angry that he failed to quickly cut ties with an associate who
allegedly had indirect links to underworld figures.
   Griffin, who bought Resorts International Inc. from Donald Trump
last year, will face another challenge in February when he goes
before the Casino Control Commission for relicensure of the
debt-ridden casino.
   Resorts suspended interest payments to bondholders last month,
saying it wasn't generating enough cash to pay its bills and make
needed repairs to the hotel-casino. Resorts bondholders still must
approve a proposed refinancing, which the company says may be
necessary to keep it from seeking bankruptcy reorganization.
   Griffin said Thursday that in retrospect, he probably would not
have bought Resorts.
   ``I probably wouldn't have done this deal, but I would have done
some kind of Atlantic City deal,'' Griffin said.
   On Thursday, Casino Control Commission Chairman Walter Read
criticized Griffin for maintaining ties with his longtime business
manager, Michael Nigris, after learning of accusations that Nigris
had ties to organized crime.
   Nigris denies the allegations.
   Griffin testified that his first knowledge of the allegations
came in August 1988, when the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. informed him that Nigris had associations with
underworld figures. Drexel was underwriting the financing of the
Resorts deal.
   Griffin hired his own investigators, who raised similar
allegations, and reported them to the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement.
   Griffin removed Nigris from any involvement in the Resorts
transaction and fired Marvin Kern, whom Nigris had hired to monitor
the acquisition of Resorts, but did not terminate other business
relationships with Nigris until this May.
   The entertainer said he retained Nigris because Nigris had not
been charged with any crime and was a victim of guilt by
association.
   Nigris also was interviewed under oath by the state gaming
division, and he has launched a legal battle to keep confidential
the results of the probe concerning his associations.
   Nigris on Thursday condemned the casino commission's comments
about him, and rejected suggestions that he had ties to people with
links to organized crime.
   ``I am distressed to learn that the commission has chosen to
rely upon and disclose the conclusions of a report that are
baseless and unfounded. I have had a long and distinguished
business career. At no time have I associated with members of
organized crime,'' Nigris said in a statement read by his lawyer,
David J. Satz.
   Satz would not comment further.
   Read said the reasons Griffin gave for firing Nigris, which
centered on Griffin's dissatisfaction with the acquisition of a
Boston radio station, were ``disturbing.''
   ``It seems fair to say from the record as a whole that Griffin
continued to employ Nigris after the investigative reports because
it was in his business interest to do so, and terminated Nigris
only when Nigris' business performance became unsatisfactory,''
said Read.
   But Read said the one incident should not cause the panel to
question Griffin's ``good character, honesty and integrity.''

<HEAD>Takeover Panel Upholds Hoylake Extension, Rejects BAT Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers rejected
today an appeal by BAT Industries PLC to reverse a decision giving
Hoylake Investments Ltd. more time to complete its $22 billion
hostile bid for the conglomerate.
   The regulatory panel's appeal committee upheld the Sept. 15
decision that BAT shareholders should have the chance to consider
the Hoylake offer free from U.S. regulatory obstacles.
   ``In principle we see no reason for disagreeing'' with the
decision of the full panel, the committee said in a statement.
   Hoylake, which is led by financier Sir James Goldsmith, had
sought the extension because it must seek approval of regulatory
authorities in the United States before it can acquire BAT's
Farmers Insurance Group Inc.
   A bidder in Britain usually is given 90 days to win control of
its target, a deadline Hoylake is not expected to meet. Without an
extension, a bidder generally must wait a year before renewing its
offer.
   The takeover panel ruled that Hoylake could make a new offer for
BAT within 21 days of overcoming its regulatory obstacles in the
United States.
   BAT had argued to the appeals committee that allowing Hoylake
more time would place the conglomerate under siege.
   BAT stock was unchanged at 818 pence, or $13.33, a share in
early trading on London's Stock Exchange.
   Hoylake has offered 878 pence, or $14.31, in securities for each
BAT share on July 11.
   BAT said Friday after the panel announced its decision its
shareholders have shown ``quite clearly that Hoylake's proposals
are wholly unacceptable.''
   Although Hoylake is now 11 weeks into its bid, BAT said, only a
``minuscule'' number of shareholders have accepted the offer. At
the last announced count, Hoylake had obtained less than 3 percent
of BAT's shares.
   Analysts have said Hoylake must put some cash into its offer for
the bid to succeed.
   Goldsmith's group it welcomed the appeals committee decision.
   Hoylake has said it plans to sell Farmers to the French
insurance company Axa Midi Assurances.
   ``To this end, Hoylake and its advisers are in discussion with
Axa Midi and its advisers to coordinate their activities in the
U.S. in the most efficient manner,'' Hoylake said.
   On Tuesday, BAT announced a major restructuring designed to fend
off BAT's bid.
   BAT's plans are to pare its operations into two core areas of
financial services and tobacco through the sale and spinoffs of its
retail and paper businesses.
   BAT's shareholders are to vote on these proposals on Oct. 19.
   Hoylake has said it would vote in favor of the BAT restructuring
as a first step toward breaking up the conglomerate. Hoylake wants
to sell off all of BAT's non-tobacco assets.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines parent, AMR Corp.,
said Friday it is asking federal regulators and the New York Stock
Exchange to investigate recent media reports about the company,
which is a rumored takeover target.
   The announcement came after AMR stock rose sharply amid talk
that the airline would be taken over or restructured. On Thursday,
AMR rose $4.75 a share to close at $83.75 on the NYSE. Trading was
heavy, with more than two million shares changing hands.
   ``AMR Corp. is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the New York Stock Exchange to investigate recent Dow Jones press
reports regarding the company,'' American spokesman Al Becker said.
   He added he could not comment further on the reports or the
reason for the investigation. Officials at Dow Jones News Service
were not immediately available for comment.
   Analysts said AMR stock rose partly because of rumors that a
takeover offer was imminent, with New York developer Donald Trump
fingered as a possible suitor.
   A stock arbitrager told Dow Jones News Service on Thursday that
``the Donald Trump rumor is all over the place.''
   Also Thursday, a rumor surfaced that AMR managers could be
considering an employee stock ownership plan that would place some
company stock _ possibly as much as 15 to 20 percent _ in the hands
of airline workers.
   A source told The Dallas Morning News that such a stake could be
large enough to hinder an unsolicited takeover bid.
   Speculation surfaced on Wednesday that AMR was on Goldman Sach &amp;
Co.'s restricted list, meaning the company refrains from making
recommendations on whether to buy or sell the company's stock.
   Traders said that signaled that a deal or defensive
restructuring could happen soon, the Dow Jones News Service
reported.
   Another rumor involved a management-led buyout, with
participation from AMR's pilots' union and investors Sid and Lee
Bass of Fort Worth.

<HEAD>China To Lose $1.3 Billion in Tourist Revenues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last June has cost the People's
Republic at least $1 billion in lost tourist revenues, a Chinese
official said Thursday.
   ``We lost $1 billion or so this year,'' said Chinese Counsel
General Zheng Wanzhen of San Francisco after a brief appearance at
a meeting of the International Association of Travel Research and
Marketing Professionals.
   A panel of Asian experts said the lost tourist revenues would
total $1.3 billion by the end of the year.
   The official Chinese government travel service had expected
tourist revenues of $2.6 billion this year, up from $2 billion in
1988.
   Zheng was optimistic that the tourist trade would snap back.
``By next year it will be fully recovered,'' he predicted.``What
happened in June and July is a very minor event in the course of
China's history.''
   But others at the meeting disagreed on how quickly travel to
China would pick up.
   Tour operator Lee Marona said it would be ``a slow process.''
   ``China's tourism industry today is in serious trouble,'' Miller
said. While he encouraged travel professionals to send clients to
China, he recommended they travel in groups.
   ``Individual travel, especially in the disturbed areas, should
be kept to a minimum,'' Miller said.
   A survey of U.S. travel agents and tour operators by the Pacific
Asia Travel Association indicated that only 8 percent of clients
with summer reservations for China kept their plans. Safety was the
main reason cited for changing or canceling plans, said Jerry
Piccolla, PATA vice president.

<TEXT>
   Vermont American Corp. has agreed to be
acquired for $440 million, or $40 a share in cash, to Emerson
Electric Co. of St. Louis and Robert Bosch GmbH of Stuttgart, West
Germany.
   ``The transaction was the result of an auction process
supervised by a special committee of independent directors,''
Vermont American Chairman Lee B. Thomas Jr. said in a news release
Thursday.
   ``The board was very pleased with the transaction and the
benefits it will provide for Vermont American shareholders as well
as its employees, customers and the communities in which it
operates,'' he said.
   Bill Anderson, a spokesman for Emerson Electric, said the
buyers' ``intention is to operate the company as it's structured
now.''
   Emerson and Bosch plan to retain the current management of the
Louisville-based Vermont American and anticipate no layoffs or
plant closings, Anderson said.
   Nearly 4,000 people are employed by Vermont American.
   In a statement, Emerson and Bosch said they will form a new
company that next week will begin a tender offer for all Vermont
American shares. Emerson and Bosch will have equal shares of the
new company.
   Vermont American's biggest customer _ Sears, Roebuck and Co. _
will be a minority shareholder in the company after the sale, the
statement said.
   There is little to stand in the way of the deal because the
Thomas and Dunbar families of Louisville control more than half of
Vermont American's outstanding stock, and they have agreed to the
sale.
   The buyers already have agreements to purchase 55 percent of the
company's outstanding shares from ``principal shareholders,'' which
would include the two families, the news release said. Those shares
would be bought at the same price paid other shareholders, it said.
   The price could be adjusted to $41 a share if pending litigation
with Newell Co., another Vermont American suitor, is resolved,
Vermont American said.
   Vermont American's stock was trading at $37.50 a share Thursday
on the American Stock Exchange, up $1.25, when trading was halted
pending the announcement.
   The company has been best known as a maker of blades for cutting
tools. It has diversified, however, and recently its Gilmour Group
subsidiary, which produces lawn and garden equipment, has been a
fast-growing segment of the company.
   Last year, Vermont American reported profits of $16.8 million,
or $1.67 a share, on sales of $329 million.
   Emerson, which makes electronic and electrical products and
consumer, industrial and defense goods, had sales of $6.17 billion
last year and employs about 68,000 people.
   Bosch makes automotive components, home appliances, photographic
equipment and other products. It had sales of $16.16 billion last
year and employs more than 160,000 people.

<HEAD>Three Airlines Announce Plans for Joint Reservation System</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS Saber to Sabre throughout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta would be the headquarters of a proposed
computer reservation system combining the systems of Delta Air
Lines, Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines.
   The airlines said Thursday they had reached a preliminary
agreement for the joint venture, 10 days after it was disclosed
that the companies were discussing such a plan.
   The system would be autonomous and independently managed, but
Delta would own the largest portion and one of its executives would
be the new company's chief executive officer.
   Ownership of the new system was carved up according to the
relative size of the carriers in the industry, said Delta spokesman
Jim Lundy.
   The system would combine the technologically superior Pars
reservation system, started three years ago by NWA and TWA, with
Delta's Datas II system. Delta will pay $48 million to TWA under
the proposal.
   The announcement earlier this month that the three carriers were
talking came as no surprise to industry observers, who had expected
Delta to pursue some type of venture after a previous attempt to
merge its reservation system with industry leader Sabre, owned by
American Airlines parent AMR Corp., ran into regulatory roadblocks.
   Lundy said the airlines decided to announce the discussions
earlier this month ``because we knew it would leak out.''
   The proposed Datas II-Sabre plan was dropped after the Justice
Department threatened to file an antitrust suit. The agency said
that venture would harm competition in the computerized sale of
airline tickets.
   Industry analysts have said the new plan is less likely to draw
such opposition because Pars is considerably smaller than Sabre.
   Sabre is used by 12,800 travel agency offices and is the biggest
of the five U.S. computerized reservation systems. Lundy said Pars
is in third place and Datas II is No. 5.
   Lundy declined to predict how big a market share the new company
would have because it would be about four years before it is
running.
   Though no single carrier will control the new company,
Atlanta-based Delta will own the largest chunk at 40 percent.
Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest will own 33.3 percent, and New
York-based TWA will own 26.6 percent.
   The joint system would be consistent with the design of emerging
international reservations systems, the three airlines said in an
announcement.
   The three airlines also said other carriers will have an
opportunity to become partners.
   When the agreement is finalized, a data center will be designed
and built in Atlanta. The new company will begin developing
software and operating systems for the joint venture. The company
also will have marketing offices in Kansas City.
   Reservations systems make money from fees charged to airlines. A
carrier pays the system a fee whenever it books a flight for that
airline.
   The computer systems are the primary channel for distributing
airline tickets. They provide information about schedules, fares,
seat availability, hotels, car rentals and package vacations.
   Cal Rader, vice president for marketing automation at Delta, is
to be chief executive officer of the joint system.

   General Growth Management Inc. has
agreed to acquire Center Cos., a union that would create the fourth
largest shopping center management company in the United States, it
was announced today.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   General Growth said that when the deal is completed in late
October, the combined operation would be the largest manager of
retail properties for institutional investors, with more than 52
million square feet of shopping centers, including 63 regional
centers.
   Prior to its formation as Center in 1980, the Minneapolis-based,
privately held real estate company was the real estate arm of
Dayton Hudson Corp.
   General Growth, based in Des Moines, founded by brothers Matthew
and Martin Bucksbaum, began as developers in the Midwest and
expanded into a national shopping center company.
   Among the larger properties in the combined portfolio are the
Ala Moana Center in Honolulu; Southdale, Brookdale and Rosedale
malls in the Minneapolis area; Northland, Eastland and Westland
malls in the Detroit area; Smith Haven Mall on Long Island, N.Y.;
Bellis Fair at Bellingham, Wash.; Eastland Mall at Evansville,
Ind.; and Fox River Mall at Appleton, Wis.
   ``The merger of the two companies creates an exciting
opportunity for the formation of a premier retail management
company,'' said a statement issued by Matthew Bucksvaum, the
chairman of General Growth, and Michael Kelly, chairman of Center.
   ``The newly formed company will offer outstanding strength in
asset strategies, leasing, marketing and development services to
our existing client base, and to new clients nationally,'' the
statement said.
   The merged company will have more than 1,800 employees.

   Spuds MacKenzie, fun-loving party dog from
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., meet your new partner: Shamu, that
well-known killer whale.
   Anheuser-Busch announced Thursday it agreed to pay $1.1 billion
for the four Sea World parks around the country plus two other
theme parks from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
   ``We have considered Sea World as the ideal acquisition for some
period of time,'' said W. Randolph Baker, vice president and group
executive for Anheuser Busch.
   The deal will make the brewer the second largest theme park
operator in America behind Walt Disney Co., and will help Harcourt
pay off the huge debt the publishing and insurance company
accumulated in thwarting a hostile takeover two years ago.
   But Wall Street apparently was displeased with the deal.
Harcourt stock had plunged $3.87{ a share to $12.37{ in early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Stock analysts who follow Anheuser-Busch applauded the
acquisition, but said it will have very little impact on the St.
Louis-based company's profits or makeup.
   ``This is a real drop in the beer barrel, but it's a
diversification move that's going to work and that's better than
one that doesn't work,'' said Julie Neiman, a St. Louis-based
analyst for Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. Inc.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's leading beer maker, has four core
businessess: beer, food, container manufacturing and family
entertainment. However, 90 precent of the company's sales come from
beer and beer-related ventures.
   ``The Sea World acquisition will give us a broad base for future
expansion,'' said Baker. He said the purchase should be completed
in November.
   Anheuser-Busch already operates Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla.,
one of the biggest zoos in the country; a 17th century
European-style park in Williamsburg, Va.; a water park in Tampa;
and a futuristic children's park near Philadelphia.
   The company also is planning a major theme park and resort in
Spain, along the Mediterranean coast just south of Barcelona,
according to Baker. It's scheduled to open in 1992 or 1993.
   The popular Sea World parks, which feature performing killer
whales, trained dolphins and other talented creatures from the sea,
are located in San Diego; Orlando, Fla.; San Antonio, Texas; and
Aurora, Ohio.
   The other parks involved in the deal are Boardwalk and Baseball
in Orlando and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla. The purchase
also includes land adjacent to the three Florida parks, the Sea
World of Texas and the Orlando airport.
   Overall attendance at the parks was 14.5 million last year.
   Analysts say Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, a leading textbook
publisher, is selling the parks in an effort to pay off a nearly
$2.9 billion debt it accumulated when the Orlando-based company
fended off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by British
communications mogul Robert Maxwell.
   ``They (Harcourt Brace) didn't have a whole lot of choice,''
said Robert Dunlap Jr., analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York.
   But in giving up the theme park business, Harcourt Brace also is
relieving itself of chronic management problems and falling
attendance at the six parks.
   In 1988, sales at the parks totaled $388 million and pre-tax
earnings were $62 million. This year pre-tax earnings were
projected to rise to $90 million, analysts said.
   Only two bidders for the park actually went public with their
plans. One was a group of former Harcourt Brace and Sea World
executives led by Sea World founder George Millay. The other was
Florida Leisure Acquisition Corp., which owns the Silver Springs
attraction in Ocala.
   Harcourt Brace has been in the theme park business for 13 years.
   The purchase price of $1.1 billion includes $975 for the theme
parks and the rest for the Harcourt Brace's land holdings. The
agreement also calls for Harcourt Brace to receive half of the
profits over $100 million from any sale of this land.

   The Belgian national bank raised
short-term interest rates for the third time in a week on Friday,
while the Swiss national bank also hiked a key lending rate.
   The Banque Nationale said the three-month treasury bill rate,
considered the most important in Belgian banking, was raised 0.30
percentage point to 9.20 percent.
   One-month and two-month treasury certificates were also raised
0.30 percentage point to 9.00 percent and 9.10 percent,
respectively.
   Belgian short-term rates were last changed Wednesday, when they
were raised 0.15 percentage point across the board. Since early
this month short-term rates have risen by as much as 0.75
percentage point.
   Belgium's short-term interest rates have been rising in tandem
with West German rates in recent weeks.
   In Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank set the Lombard rate at
8.25 percent, up [ percentage point from Thursday.
   The Lombard rate is what the central bank charges commercial
banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as
collateral.
   In Britain, there were concerns in the financial markets that
the government might increase interest rates, which stand at 14
percent, to bolster the pound. Sterling was hit by poor trade
figures released on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed early
today's on the Chicago Board of Trade following a government report
showing smaller wheat supplies and larger corn and soybean stocks
than traders had expected.
   The corn and soybean markets opened lower in reaction to the
quarterly report, then rallied in sympathy with the wheat market,
where the price for near-term delivery surged above $4 a bushel for
the first time in two weeks.
   ``It's hard to keep the bean market down when you've got corn
fractionally lower and wheat four cents higher,'' said Pat
O'Connell, a grain market analyst with Refco Inc., a Chicago-based
futures brokerage.
   The USDA projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990, at 1.91
billion bushels, essentially unchanged from a year ago, compared to
trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion.
   Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion
bushels, compared with estimates averaging 1.89 billion and
year-ago stocks of 4.26 billion.
   The USDA estimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million
bushels, compared with estimates averaging 159 million and year-ago
stocks of 302 million.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 5 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.04{ a bushel; corn
futures were } cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.33\
a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents lower with December at
$1.44\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1 cent higher with
November at $5.70{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher and pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .52 cent higher with October at
72.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent higher
with October at 83.37 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent lower
to .10 cent higher with October at 43.45 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .27 cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at
48.70 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures

<TEXT>
   Goldome said today it has received
government approval to sell 11 branches to Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. at a $40 million profit, pushing Goldome toward operating
in the black.
   ``These sale transactions are evidence of the major strides we
are making toward our goal of profitability,'' Goldome President
Thomas A. Cooper said in a prepared statement.
   The bank also announced the sale of a subsidiary, Goldome
Strategic Investments (GSI), to a limited partnership formed by GSI
senior executives. Goldome will realize a $10 million profit from
the sale.
   Cooper said the divestitures are part of a comprehensive
restructuring plan that has the bank ``confidently looking toward
the 1990s.''
   Goldome spokeswoman Joyce Buchnowski said the deals are a sign
that the bank, founded in Buffalo in 1846, is continuing the
restructuring process Cooper began when he became Goldome's chief
executive officer in April.
   She said the chances are ``very good'' that Goldome will show a
profit in the fourth quarter, when the profit from the sale of the
New York City-area branches will be recorded. Goldome has not
reported a profit since the third quarter of 1987.
   The sale includes six branches in Manhattan, four on Long
Island, and one in suburban Orange County. The sale price was not
announced.
   Both the state Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board
granted Goldome permission to proceed after reviewing charges that
Manufacturers Hanover had made insufficient and discriminatory
mortgage loans in Brooklyn.
   Goldome will retain 17 other branches in New York City and its
suburbs. Those branches have about $1.8 billion in deposits.
   The bank will also continue to retain all consumer and mortgage
loans made by the branches that were sold to Manufacturers Hanover,
which will get the branches and its $1.2 billion in deposits.

<HEAD>Apple Is First U.S. Firm To Shun Chip-Making Consortium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. has become the
first U.S. electronics company to decline to join the chip-making
consortium called U.S. Memories Inc.
   ``At this time, we have decided not to fund them,'' an Apple
spokeswoman confirmed Thursday. ``It doesn't fit into our top
priorities right now.''
   U.S. Memories is a $1 billion collaborative venture aimed at
breaking U.S. dependence on foreign-made memory chips known as
DRAMs, or dynamic, random-access memory chips.
   DRAMs are used in everything from computers to fax machines, and
Japanese companies dominate the world's supply.
   The consortium's success depends on finding companies willing to
invest in capital in return for an assured supply of DRAMs. But
industry analysts said Apple's decision is an isolated letdown.
   ``It's not a turning point,'' said Fred Jones, a semiconductor
analyst with Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. ``I'm not sure it would
discourage another company from participating if they thought it
was to their advantage to do so.''
   A shortage of memory chips last year led Apple to hike the price
of its computers, which hurt the company's profits. However, Apple
now says it can fill its DRAM needs without another source.

<HEAD>Government OKs Takeover of Northwest Airlines</HEAD>

   The Department of Transportation today
announced approval of the Wings Holdings Co. Inc. takeover of
Northwest Airlines after first insisting on steps to prevent
foreign control of the airline.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said an agreement with
Northwest will alleviate government concerns about the interest of
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and foreign banks in the takeover by the
holding company set up by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi.
   Skinner has said the government is concerned about increasing
foreign investment in U.S. airlines because it could compromise
negotiations with foreign governments over routes.
   Checchi, at a news conference with Skinner, said in a statement
that he disagreed with some of the government's conclusions in the
$3.65 billion deal, including the influence KLM would have over the
company.
   ``We do not agree that KLM is, or has ever been, in a position
to exercise any actual control over NWA,'' Checchi said in the
statement.
   However, Checchi said Wings had agreed to reduce KLM's interest,
dissolve a three-member KLM financial advisory committee and take
away the voting power of KLM's one seat on NWA's 12-member board on
certain issues.
   Skinner praised Checchi as a man with an outstanding reputation
with both management and employees. As part of the agreement to
approve the takeover, the department will conduct a continuing
review of Northwest's finances, requiring regular reports from the
company.
   The department also had expressed concern about the more than $3
billion in debt that the takeover gives the airline, the nation's
sixth largest.
   Under the original arrangement, KLM was providing $400 million
of the $700 million that Checchi raised to buy Northwest, but would
have controlled only 5 percent of its voting stock.
   The Transportation Department concluded, however, that the deal
would put KLM ``in a position to exercise control over Northwest''
and that it would in effect no longer be considered a U.S. carrier
under the law.
   Foreign companies cannot own more than 25 percent of a U.S.
airline.
   Skinner said the department has an obligation to determine
whether any acquisition will allow an airline to continue giving
safe service and remain under the control of U.S. citizens.
   Earlier this week, the government asked United Airlines to
disclose how much a planned employee management takeover will allow
foreign influence over that airline. The $6.5 billion stock buyout
plan includes participation from British Airways.
   Skinner declines to respond to questions on the department's
review of that transaction.

<HEAD>Sony Won't Make Rambo a Samurai After Buyout of Columbia Pictures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the next Hollywood blockbuster hits American
movie screens, you may be able to say, ``It's a Sony.''
   Sony Corp. says its $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc., which follows its 1987 buyout of CBS Records,
is aimed at getting involved in making ``software'' to use in the
audio-visual equipment it sells.
   But don't worry about Rambo decked out as a samurai next time
around, or Michael Jackson singing in Japanese.
   What Sony wants out of these American companies, say analysts,
is for them to keep doing what they're best at _ turning out the
American-style entertainment that dominates cinema and music
markets worldwide.
   Sony's recent wheeling and dealing involved some of America's
pop icons: Rambo, Bruce Springsteen, and Coca-Cola Co., to name a
few.
   Sony announced Wednesday it is buying the Columbia studios, home
of Rambo. Two years ago it plunked down $2 billion for CBS Records,
which has contracts with stars such as Springsteen and Michael
Jackson.
   Meanwhile, Coca-Cola stands to collect $1.45 billion from
selling its 49 percent share in Columbia to Sony.
   But while a few American pundits have raised concerns that Sony
may use its new media clout for ``propaganda'' purposes, industry
analysts in Tokyo scoff.
   ``I don't think they would be so stupid,'' says Martin
Beresford, a senior analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
Propaganda films probably wouldn't be great hits at the box office,
he notes, and censorship would be too dangerous.
   ``Sony is far too sophisticated to consider something as
blatantly inappropriate (as propaganda or censorship) ... they know
that even the merest whiff of that would constitute an enormous
public relations risk.''
   Analysts say Sony has taken a hands-off policy at CBS Records,
leaving the music-making to Americans while providing Japanese
financial backing. So far this formula has made the CBS venture far
more profitable than analysts had expected.
   Sony's last annual report noted with satisfaction that ``a large
number of hit albums'' from CBS contributed to a 37.9 percent
annual increase in overall sales, which hit $16.2 billion in the
year ended March 31. The company's net income, at $549 million, was
up 94.6 percent from the previous year.
   ``As is the case with CBS Records, we would intend to operate
Columbia as a U.S. company with U.S. management,'' Sony President
Norio Ohga said.
   In effect, Sony wants to sell American ``software'' _ what used
to be known as movies and television shows _ in new forms, such as
laser disks and 8mm video tapes.
   Analysts say it's a rational division of labor.
   While Japanese electronics companies are crack manufacturers and
exporters of gee-whiz technology, the Japanese film and music
industries are about as competitive in world markets as American
soy sauce makers.
   U.S. movies, by contrast, are one of America's biggest export
success stories from London to Bangkok to Katmandu. Hollwood is
dream-seller to the world, with entertainment ranking as America's
second largest export, netting $5 billion annually.
   Rambo can be seen (surreptitiously) in even isolationist Burma;
``The Last Emperor,'' also a Columbia film, was shown in China. In
South Korea, American films are so popular that alleged agents of
local filmmakers, fearing competition, released snakes and tear gas
into theaters to discourage people from seeing directly distributed
U.S. films.
   The reception in Tokyo is friendlier. Japanese love American
films as much as Americans love Japanese electronics. America
exports more movies to Japan than to any other single market;
entertainment is one area in which the United States enjoys a
surplus with its economic archrival.
   ``For many Japanese, `movies' means American movies. They don't
think of American films as foreign films,'' says Hidekazu Tanaka,
an official at Columbia Pictures' Tokyo branch.
   Among films shown in Japan last year, 289 were American,
according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Only 102
were Japanese.
   The top four grossing films in Japanese history were ``E.T.,''
``Star Wars,'' ``Jaws,'' and ``Ghostbusters,'' according to
industry statistics.
   ``Ghostbusters,'' a Columbia release, brought in profits of
$17.8 million in 1984. ``Fatal Attraction'' recovered all of its
production costs in Japanese theaters alone.
   Sony is reportedly eager to expand the number of Columbia's
library of more than 2,700 movies available on laser disk and 8mm
video. Classic Columbia films popular in Japan include ``Bridge
over the River Kwai,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' and ``On the
Waterfront.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed modestly higher on London's
Stock Exchange Friday on a flurry of new trading-account buying and
the retreat of worries over an imminent increase in British
interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 7.7
points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,299.4, the day's high. Early in the
session, when rumors of an interest rate hike swept the market, the
key index dropped to its session low of 2,278.3.
   Volume was 495.1 million shares, up from 403.5 million shares
Thursday.
   The day's early losses were reversed when the new two-week
account opened 90 minutes before the market closed and some new
buying came into the generally thin market, dealers said.
   The exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week
periods for accounting purposes.

owner of Atlanta Magazine, said that American Express ``will
continue its first-class publishing job for Atlanta.''
   Ryder said that American Express planned no major staff changes.
   American Express Publishing is a wholly owned subsidiary of
American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc. and also
publishes Travel &amp; Leisure, the world's largest travel magazine;
Food and Wine; Departures; NewYork Woman, and L.A. Style magazines.
   MetroCorp also publishes Philadelphia, Boston and Manhattan Inc.
magazines. The company acquired Atlanta magazine two years ago from

<HEAD>Privatization Postponed Up to Six Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday it would postpone its
huge privatization of the electricity industry for up to six months
because of the complexity of the sell-off.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham said in a statement: ``The
government remains on target to complete the privatization of the
industry within this parliament,'' before the next election.
   But he said sticking to the previous timetable ``would require
additional transitional arrangements which would have introduced
added complexity to the task and made it more difficult for us to
meet our objective.''
   The next general election must be called before mid-1992.
   The government plans to split into two companies the Central
Electricity Generating Board, which now has a monopoly to supply
electricity to England and Wales.
   The 12 existing regional boards are to be turned into companies
that will buy electricity and sell it to homes and industry in
their regions.
   The electricity area boards are expected to be sold off in the
fall of 1990 instead of next spring or summer. The generating
companies are to be sold in first half of 1991, instead of fall
1990 to spring 1991.
   The electricity privatization, which is expected to raise
anywhere between $24 billion and $44 billion, faces strong
opposition from the Labor Party and other government critics who
believe the utility should remain in state hands.
   The government also is in the process of selling off the water
industry.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold off billions of dollars of state-owned companies to the public
in the past decade to promote capitalism in Britain.

   The stock market gained more ground today,
extending Thursday's late rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 21.85 points
Thursday, rose 8.55 to 2,703.46 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 810 up, 550 down and
551 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market appeared to benefit from last-minute

<HEAD>Hoylake Lets Offer Lapse While Its Seeks U.S. Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoylake Investments Ltd. let its $22 billion offer
for BAT Industries PLC lapse Friday as expected while it sought
regulatory approval in the United States for the hostile bid.
   Hoylake, an investor group led by financier Sir James Goldsmith,
took the step after a committee of Britain's Panel on Takeovers and
Mergers upheld a decision giving Hoylake more time to pursue its
takeover attempt.
   A bidder in Britain usually is given 90 days to win control of
its target. If it fails, it must wait a year before bidding again.
   Hoylake, which must win permission from U.S. state insurance
commissioners before it can acquire BAT's Farmers Insurance Group
Inc., was not expected to meet the deadline. Hoylake launched its
bid on June 11; the offer was scheduled to expire Oct. 7.
   The takeovers panel decided earlier this month that Hoylake
could bid again for BAT within 21 days of obtaining U.S. regulatory
approval.
   BAT had argued to the appeals committee that allowing Hoylake
more time would place it under siege, but the panel found in favor
of the investor group.
   The conglomerate responded to today's decision by noting that
while Hoylake was 11 weeks into its bid, only a ``minuscule''
number of shareholders have accepted the offer.
   BAT stock rose 2 pence, or 3 cents, a share to close at 820
pence, or $13.37, a share on London's Stock Exchange after the
decision was announced.
   Hoylake offered 878 pence, or $14.31, worth of securities for
each BAT share on July 11. The offer totaled 13.41 billion pounds,
or $22 billion, and if successful would be the second-largest
takeover in the world behind the $24.53 billion buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc. earlier this year.
   Goldsmith's group has control of 2.3 percent of BAT's shares,
Hoylake's banker, Hambros Bank Ltd., said Friday.
   Hambros said the bid had been accepted by shareholders
representing 0.05 percent of BAT's stock. Hoylake and related
parties own about 2.26 percent outright.
   BAT said Friday after the panel announced its decision that the
conglomerate's shareholders have shown ``quite clearly that
Hoylake's proposals are wholly unacceptable.''
   Securities analysts have said Hoylake must put at least some
cash into its offer for the deal to succeed.
   In an effort to speed approval of its bid in the United States,
Hoylake announced last month it would sell Farmers to the French
insurance company Axa Midi Assurances, which already does business
in several states.
   ``To this end, Hoylake and its advisers are in discussion with
Axa Midi and its advisers to coordinate their activities in the
U.S. in the most efficient manner,'' Hoylake said Friday.
   On Tuesday, BAT announced a major restructuring designed to fend
off BAT's bid.
   BAT said it would pare its operations into two core areas of
financial services and tobacco through the sale and spinoffs of its
retail and paper businesses. BAT's shareholders are to vote on
these proposals on Oct. 19.
   The conglomerate's U.S. retail operations, which are being put
on the block, include Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Up Sharply On Stocks Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed sharply higher Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade following an Agriculture Department
report that indicated U.S. wheat supplies were smaller than traders
had expected.
   Corn and soybean futures finished modestly lower, partly on
harvest pressure and partly in reaction to the USDA's report of
larger-than-expected stocks of those commodities.
   In a report released after the close of trading Thursday, the
USDA projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990, at 1.91 billion
bushels, essentially unchanged from a year ago, compared to trade
estimates averaging 1.99 billion.
   Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels
compared to trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion and year-ago
stocks of 4.26 billion.
   The USDA estimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million
bushels, compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million and
year-ago stocks of 302 million.
   Traders said a surge in in export sales of U.S. grains during
the week also helped boost wheat futures and limited losses in the
corn and soybean markets.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2\ cents to 7 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.06{ a bushel; corn was
1\ cents lower to { cent higher with December at $2.33 a bushel;
oats were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with December at $1.43} a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3\ cents lower with November at
$5.68 a bushel.

<UNK>Ferranti Confirms Fraud, Says It Must Write Off Assets</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferranti International Signal PLC said Friday it
would reduce its asset value about $300 million after a preliminary
investigation into accounting irregularities at a U.S. subsidiary
showed the defense company was defrauded.
   In a letter to shareholders, Ferranti Chairman Derek Alun-Jones
said the company would have to reduce its net asset value by about
$302 million. Ferranti had net asset value of $451 million at the
end of its last financial year.
   Alun-Jones said the reductions were forced by ``serious fraud''
in the reporting of non-existent contracts at its International
Signal and Control Group PLC unit at the time it bought the
Lancaster, Pa.-based company in 1987.
   ``It is now clear that the price paid to the shareholders of ISC
... was substantially inflated as a result of the fraud,''
Alun-Jones said.
   Ferranti bought the company for $685 million.
   In the letter, Alun-Jones said the Ferranti board was reviewing
three options to inject new capital into the company: a full
takeover bid, inviting an investor to buy a major stake in Ferranti
or issuing more shares to existing shareholders.
   Alun-Jones said Ferranti has received shows of interests from a
large number of British and foreign companies about the various
options. He did not elaborate.
   Ferranti also will forgo a final dividend payment for the year
to last March 31, allowing the company to save $21 million, he said.
   To offset the asset write-off, Alun-Jones said the Ferranti
board felt it would be necessary to raise at least $244 million in
new equity. The group has already outlined plans to reduce
indebtedness by selling about $163 million of assets.

10.43 percent, or 6.62 million shares, of Lockheed common stock.
   ``As as a matter of company policy, we have no comment,'' said
Ron Meder, a Lockheed spokesman.
   A spokesman in Dallas for Simmons could not be reached
immediately for comment.
   During the same period, Valhi sold off more than 272,000 shares
at prices ranging from $48.50 to $53 a share to ``obtain funds to
be used for working capital purposes,'' according to the filing.
   The filing said there had been no change the purpose of the
stock purchase from previous filings when Simmons said it was for
``investment and in order to acquire a significant equity interest
in the company.''

<HEAD>`Chinese Wall' Separating Banks From Securities Houses Crumbling</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead graf to recast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bit by bit, the once-impenetrable ``Chinese
wall'' separating commercial banks from investment houses is
crumbling.
   The latest fissure came two weeks ago when Bankers Trust Co. of
New York became the first bank to announce it will manage a public
sale of corporate bonds.
   Until recent years, banks were barred from most activities
associated with the securities business, such as selling stocks and
corporate bonds, under the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.
   Glass-Steagall was partly prompted by the banks' practice during
the 1920s of helping companies sell stock or bonds to the public at
inflated prices; the companies would then use the proceeds to repay
shaky loans to the banks.
   The crash of 1929 made it harder for banks to dump unsound loans
on stock and bond investors. Banks also lost money on underwritings
that weren't related to their own borrowers. The result was a
string of bank failures in the 1930s.
   Banks for many years have been permitted to sell low-risk
Treasury bonds and general-obligation municipal bonds, but the
expanded powers granted in recent years allow banks to enter a
world forbidden to them since 1933 by Glass-Steagall.
   In 1987, the Federal Reserve Board gave banks the authority to
underwrite municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper,
mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by consumer loans.
   In January, the Fed gave preliminary approval for Bankers Trust
and four other large banks to underwrite corporate bonds. Final
approval was given over the summer.
   The call by banks for the new powers was backed by the Reagan
and Bush adminstrations, which said they are needed to allow U.S.
banks to compete globally.
   The new banking powers are strongly opposed by the Securities
Industry Association, which represents the nation's investment
houses. The group has a lawsuit pending that is intended to repeal
the Fed's actions.
   The trade group contends that banks may be endangering their
depositors' money, which is federally insured, by engaging in the
risky practice of securities underwriting. The group also argues
that if changes need to be made to Glass-Steagall, Congress should
do the changing, not the Fed.
   ``A statute that everyone understood for almost 50 years has
been literally gutted by regulators,'' said Don Crawford, a vice
president of the trade group.
   The Fed's actions also have a number of congressional critics.
After the Fed gave its preliminary approval to bank bond
underwriting, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, compared it to inviting banks ``to
shoot craps with the taxpayers' money.''
   ``This is the kind of irresponsible behavior that gave us the
savings and loan crisis and brought about the 1929 crash,'' he said.
   The Fed placed a number of restrictions on the sale of bonds by
banks. One requires that this underwriting be done by separately
capitalized subsidiaries so that deposits are not put at risk. The
Fed also effectively restricted bond underwriting to the nation's
largest banks.
   Bankers Trust announced last month that it will underwrite a
$150 million junk bond issue for Morningstar Foods Inc. of Dallas,
a producer and distributor of dairy products.
   Some have questioned the wisdom of banks putting any of their
capital at risk in the high-risk junk bond market. The Securities
Industry Association speculates that the practice may lead Congress
to reexamine federal banking laws.
   The American Bankers Association says such fears are unfounded.
   ``There's proper safeguards,'' said Mary Liz Meany, an ABA
spokeswoman, referring to the Fed's restrictions on bank
underwriting.
   ABA contends that the expanded banking powers are a necessary
modernization of banking rules. However, the banking trade group
agrees that Congress, not the Fed, should be making the changes.
   The banks contend that the increased competition in bond
underwriting they will bring to the market will make it cheaper for
corporations to float new bond issues.
   ``Ultimately we expect to be a force in the (bond)
marketplace,'' said George Fasel, vice president of corporate
communications for Bankers Trust.
   The Fed has indicated it will decide by early next year whether
they also may also underwrite stock issues.
   The brokerage firms contend that the eventual outcome of the
expanded bank powers will be the destruction of the securities
industry.
   ``There will be no problem with a bank the size of Citibank
going out and buying Merrill Lynch,'' Crawford said.
   He said that when Canada's equivalent of Glass-Steagall was
repealed a few years ago, banks went on a buying spree. Today, he
said, there are few broker-dealers in Canada that aren't owned by a
bank.

<HEAD>Braniff Won't Pay Laid-Off Workers; Announces Reduced Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. on Friday said that 2,700
employees laid off when the airline sought bankruptcy protection
will not receive their last paychecks.
   The Orlando, Fla.-based airline also announced discount fares
and a limited scheduled for next week.
   Braniff said workers who were not laid off after the airline
filed for Chapter 11 bankrptcy Thursday for the second time in
seven years will be paid, possibly early next week. The laid-off
workers will not be paid.
   ``There are a great many unhappy stories in a bankruptcy,'' said
Don McGuire, a spokesman for the airline at company headquarters in
Orlando, Fla.
   ``I worked for a year to get this job ... six interviews,'' said
Nancy McElwee, a flight attendant who was laid off and planned to
return to her parents home in Cocoa Beach, Fla. ``I'm not a happy
camper right now. I wanted to go home, but not like this.''
   Braniff, meanwhile, offered a discount fare of $49 to any of the
cities the airline plans to serve next week. The fares would be
good for three days beginning Monday.
   Braniff on Friday operated flights to Dallas, Orlando and Los
Angeles. On Saturday, Braniff planned to add a flight to New York.
   The airline next week plans to add round-trip flights to
Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, San Diego and Phoenix.
   McGuire said a bankruptcy judge in Orlando had authorized the
airline to pay employees who continue to work, and to give
employees their Sept. 29 paycheck if they are recalled.
   Those laid off included pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and
others. A spokesman for Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft said about
1,900 workers _ including Braniff employees and those in related
industries _ would be affected in Kansas City, where Braniff had
been attempting to establish a hub.
   Braniff began canceling flights in Kansas City Wednesday
afternoon, and filed for bankruptcy at 1:30 a.m. Thursday. The
Chapter 11 filing protects the airline from its creditors while it
attempts to reorganize.
   Braniff had 93 flights out of Kansas City and had planned to add
eight flights Sunday. The airline's plans eventually called for 200
flights daily, and it was pressing the city for terminal
improvements and construction of a maintenance base and a concourse
for its commuter flights.
   Industry analysts said Braniff's troubles began when it was
forced to pay $32 million to acquire rights to gates at Kansas City
International Airport from Eastern Airlines.
   Braniff moved in at Kansas City after Eastern bailed out of an
attempt to establish a hub operation. The airline apparently had
thought Kansas City could sell tax-free, low interest bonds to
finance the transaction, but later learned that would be prohibited
by state law.
   A plan to borrow $75 million then unraveled. ``They simply ran
out of cash and had a payroll to meet,'' said Scott Hamilton,
editor of Commercial Aviation Week.

<TEXT>
   Three-quarters of the way through 1989, many
stock-market investors are feeling prosperous and happy _ but
reluctant to press their luck.
   If the market can hang on over the next three months to the
gains it has racked up so far, it will chalk up the eighth
consecutive yearly gain for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
composite index, the yardstick most Wall Street professionals use
to measure their performance.
   That's a long winning streak by any standard. And veteran stock
traders have long since schooled themselves that no rally lasts
forever.
   Yet stirrings already are being heard in the financial world of
optimistic talk about the outlook for 1990 and perhaps beyond.
   After rising with only a few brief interruptions through the
first eight months of the year, hitting a record high on Sept. 1,
stocks have since backtracked a bit.
   There were a few unsettling days in the market for ``junk bond''
takeover debt after it became evident that Campeau Corp. of Toronto
was having trouble digesting the retailing empire it had amassed in
the United States.
   At the same time, analysts said, money managers at investing
institutions were toting up the gains they had achieved since New
Year's and looking for ways to protect those profits from any
reversal in the market's course.
   ``It appears that many, many money managers have decided not to
play for fear of messing up a great year,'' observed Jay Donnaruma,
an analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``During this recent sideways movement volume has contracted
considerably,'' noted William LeFevre, strategist at Advest Inc.
``Much of current volume is program-related, usually done by and
for the brokerage houses themselves.
   ``So one might conclude the public, institutional and
individual, is just sitting there on the sidelines.
   ``What both the stock and bond markets await is some sort of
trigger device to get things off dead center. That trigger device
could be a resumption of interest rate cuts.''
   If interest rates are indeed headed lower, they ran into an
obstacle this past week in the form of downward pressure on the
dollar in foreign exchange.
   But the stock market managed to post some modest gains. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,692.82, up 11.21
from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.24 to 193.97;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
5.21 to 473.28, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 7.38 at 388.76.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 151.48 million shares a day,
against 139.09 million the week before.
   For the first nine months of the year, the Dow Jones industrials
show a net gain of 534.25 points, or 24.64 percent.
   ``Many investors' portfolios have performed better this year
than they anticipated, given their fairly meager expectations at
the start of the year,'' said Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   ``Those investors are becoming very cautious about doing
anything for the remainder of the year, lest they give those
windfall gains away. Unless some outside catalyst forces people to
become more aggressive in the marketplace, we face a fairly
uneventful finish to this year.''
   However, Smith adds, ``looking ahead to 1990, I expect a fairly
bright intermediate- to long-term environment. This is the time of
year when we have come to expect all those forecasts of an imminent
recession to be shoved out another 12 months or so.
   ``With that change in economic assumption, more investors should
feel comfortable with the equity market.''

   The parent of rumored takeover target American Airlines Friday
urged federal regulators and the New York Stock Exchange to
investigate recent media reports on the company.
   The AMR Corp. request came after its stock rose $4.75 as more
than two million shares changed hands Thursday amid rumors of an
impending takeover bid or defensive restructuring.
   The gains continued Friday. After a delayed opening, AMR added
another $2.75 to $86.50 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading. It was the second most active stock on the Big Board on
volume of more than 2.26 million shares.
   ``AMR Corp. today is asking the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the New York Stock Exchange to investigate recent
Dow Jones press reports regarding the company,'' American spokesman
Al Becker said.
   Becker would not elaborate on the reports or the reason for the
investigation.
   ``We have no comment on this because there is nothing said about
what reports are involved and why they are asking for the
investigation,'' said Roger May, director of corporate relations
for Dow Jones &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``All we know is the report we've seen that they've asked the
NYSE and the SEC to investigate. It's a little hard to respond to.''
   The higher stock price, according to industry and securities
analysts, resulted partly from rumors that an AMR takeover bid was
imminent, with New York developer Donald Trump a possible bidder
for the company.
   On Thursday, a stock arbitrageur told Dow Jones News Service
that ``the Donald Trump rumor is all over the place.''
   A rumor also surfaced Thursday that AMR managers could be
considering an employee stock ownership plan that would place a
small amount of company stock, possibly 15 to 20 percent, in the
hands of airline workers.
   That amount of stock, though less than a controlling interest,
could be big enough to hinder an unsolicited takeover bid, a source
told The Dallas Morning News.
   On Wednesday, speculation surfaced that AMR stock was on the
restricted list of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., which would mean the
investment banking firm would refrain from making recommendations
to buy or sell AMR shares.
   According to the Dow Jones News Service, traders said this
signaled the possibility that a defensive restructuring or a
takeover deal could occur soon.
   A management-led buyout, with participation from the AMR pilots'
union and investors Sid and Lee Bass of Fort Worth, was the subject
of another rumor.

   The stock market was mixed Friday, pulling back
from an early gain in a session typical of the hesitant pattern
that has prevailed all through September.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 12 points at
midday, closed with a 2.09 loss at 2,692.82. For the week, the
average posted a net gain of 11.21 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
885 up, 565 down and 521 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.30 million
shares, down from 164.24 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 184.73 million shares.
   Analysts said the market appeared to benefit in early trading
from last-minute buying by investing institutions readying their
portfolios for reports to clients on the third quarter, which ended
with Friday's session.
   But they said uncertainty over recent weakness in the dollar and
some upward pressure on interest rates limited enthusiasm for
stocks.
   The government reported Friday morning that the index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.3 percent in August. The figure came in
close to advance estimates on the Street, and had little
perceptible effect on the market.
   After dropping 44.45 points in September, the Dow Jones
industrials reached the end of the third quarter showing a net gain
of 534.25 points, or 24.64 percent, since New Year's.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose 1 to 44~; International Business Machines gained \ to 109\;
General Electric dropped { to 56{, and McDonald's was down | at 29}.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich tumbled 4[ to 12[ as the most active
NYSE issue on volume of more than 3.6 million shares. Analysts
cited disappointment over the $1.1 billion price for which Anheuser
Busch agreed to buy six HBJ amusement parks.
   Anheuser Busch, which separately announced the death of its
former chairman, August A. Busch Jr., rose 1[ to 43].
   Airline issues were broadly higher amid signs of a revival of
takeover enthusiasm. UAL gained 4{ to 282; AMR 2} to 86{, and Delta
Air Lines 2] to 73}.
   Entergy rose { to 22|, trading at new 52-week highs. The company
said it would ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for
authority to buy back as much as 10 percent of its stock.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.54 billion, or 0.28
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .42 to 193.97.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .14 to 397.95, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .55 at 349.15.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.78 to 473.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of UAL Corp., is
widely touted as the ``whiz kid'' of the nation's airline industry
and a highly capable manager.
   But the 48-year-old Wolf faces a daunting test in pulling off
the proposed pilot-management buyout of United Airlines' parent.
The ambitious takeover _ from which Wolf stands to make $76.7
million from his UAL stock and options _ could be dashed by
government regulators worried about airline competition.
   Wolf, who left cargo carrier Tiger International Inc. in
December 1987 to head UAL (then called Allegis Corp.), had earned a
reputation for turning troubled companies around. Some people call
him the Lee Iacocca of the airline industry.
   The lanky (6-foot-7) Wolf built his career by jumping from job
to job the way a commuter carrier hops from one town to another.
After working 15 years at American Airlines, he did much shorter
stints as president of Continental Airlines, marketing chief at Pan
American World Airways, head of now-defunct Republic Airlines, then
chairman of Tiger.
   Raised in a working-class family in Oakland, Calif., Wolf
unloaded boxcars at an auto factory and worked on the Oakland docks
before graduating from San Francisco State University in 1965 with
a degree in sociology. He then started at American Airlines.
   Unlike some of the companies where he had worked, Allegis was
basically a healthy enterprise when Wolf arrived on the scene.
Still, it was a slumbering giant in the throes of a wrenching
restructuring that included sales of its non-airline assets: the
Hilton International and Westin hotel chains and the Hertz rental
car company.
   Since then, Chicago-based UAL has cut costs and expanded its
fleet _ and Wolf's already strong reputation has been enhanced. In
an industry racked by labor disputes and the rigors of competition,
Wolf and American Airlines boss Robert Crandall have emerged as the
most respected U.S. airline executives.
   ``I think there's a lot of faith in'' Wolf, said Edward
Starkman, an airline analyst at PaineWebber Inc. ``He's got very
good people skills.''
   Those skills are being tested to the limit by the $6.75 billion
takeover gambit led by Wolf and other top UAL managers, allied with
the company's 7,000 pilots and British Airways PLC. The buyout
would create the biggest employee-owned company in the nation, with
workers holding 75 percent of UAL in exchange for wage and benefit
concessions.
   Wolf, who would remain as head of the company, already has
flexed his leadership muscle in lining up bank financing for the
$300-a-share deal.
   What worries partisans of the buyout, though, is scrutiny by the
government, which has been making increasingly loud noises about
takeovers of big U.S. airlines _ the debt they pile up and the
foreign partners they bring in.
   Last Monday, the Transportation Department gave Wolf until Oct.
10 to furnish information on investors and financial arrangements
in the UAL buyout plan, with a view to determining how much foreign
influence over the airline the takeover would allow.
   Under the proposal, British Airways would hold 15 percent of UAL
in exchange for a $750 million investment, while Wolf's management
group would own the remaining 10 percent.
   Many analysts and investors fear the government might impose the
same limitation on British Airways' role that it did on KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, the foreign partner in the recent $3.65 billion
buyout of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and NWA's new principal
owner, investor Alfred Checchi, announced Friday that KLM would
reduce its interest in the deal in compliance with Skinner's
request.
   Wolf issued a statement late Friday saying he was ``confident''
the UAL buyout plan would pass muster with the government.
   ``The action taken today by the Department of Transportation
indicates that Secretary Skinner is carefully examining each
transaction on its own facts,'' Wolf said.
   But if Wolf's deal is subjected to similar scrutiny, ``That
could make the deal fall apart,'' warned Raymond Neidl, an analyst
at investment firm Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Inc.
   If the British airline's equity contribution were reduced, the
buyout might have to be restructured at a lower price or postponed,
he suggested.
   That wariness has been manifest on Wall Street recently. After a
dizzying runup, UAL shares last week were trading below the $300
offered by the Wolf group.
   There are other potential obstacles. The Machinists, the largest
union at United, have so far refused to participate in the buyout,
which would require them to join the pilots in making wage
concessions.
   The Machinists are expected to ask UAL soon to negotiate a new
labor contract, and the union could use the issue of its
participation as a bargaining chip in the talks.
   Analysts believe the pilot-management takeover could succeed
without the Machinists, who have had a rocky relationship in recent
years with the pilots at United.
   In addition, Wolf has come under fire from the UAL Machinists
and flight attendants for the estimated $76.7 million he stands to
reap if the buyout succeeds: $22.5 million for his 75,000 UAL
shares and $54.17 million for his options to buy another 250,000
shares.
   He quickly countered that he is willing to work without a year's
salary and the ``golden parachute'' of severance pay.
   Wolf ``must be taking this rather personally,'' said a former
associate who asked not to be identified, noting that the airline
chief is concerned about impressions and likely was stung by the
unions' criticism.
   If anyone can pull off the ambitious project, it's Wolf,
analysts say.
   ``I think the deal probably will go through,'' Neidl said.
``Steve Wolf is very important as part of this deal.''

   Social Security's toll-free telephone service
will expand to cover the entire country beginning Sunday, officials
said Friday.
   The service was introduced a year ago, but before the expansion
was available to only 60 percent of the country.
   Gwendolyn King, Social Security commissioner, said that while
studies show many prefer to deal by phone with the agency, the
toll-free service ``is not intended to replace face-to-face contact
for anyone who prefers to visit a Social Security office in
person.''
   Callers can reach Social Security on the toll-free line 24 hours
a day every day of the year. Between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., they can
speak directly with a Social Security representative. At other
times, automatic answering units provide basic information or take
messages.

   Washington apple growers made a record
$493.6 million in 1988 despite the Alar scare but with the help of
a federal bailout, the Washington Department of Agriculture
reported.
   The income was about $100 million below the department's
projections for the year, which likely reflects the impact of Alar,
department spokeswoman Mary Beth Lang said Thursday.
   After the Alar scare and late in the season, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture created a $9.5 million emergency bailout program to
distribute stockpiled apples to the poor as a way to reduce
supplies.
   The 1988 income reflects the so-called ``farm gate value'' of
apples, which is what farmers receive. It does not represent the
value produced by the state's extensive apple processing plants,
which turn out juice, apple sauce and other products.
   Washington's 4,500 growers produce about half the nation's
apples.
   The 1988 production value for growers jumped 42 percent over a
1987 crop that was worth just $312 million. The 1987 crop was
plagued by poor weather and poor quality that depressed prices for
the entire year, said Charles St. John, spokesman for the
Washington Apple Commission.
   The 1988 value was also higher than the 1986 value of $488
million, the previous record.
   The Alar scare began in late February 1988 when a private
consumer group issued a report warning that eating apples treated
with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in children.
   Although the report's findings were hotly disputed, wholesale
prices plunged 50 percent and sales also dropped.
   Prior to the Alar scare, growers were enjoying an outstanding
year and the Agriculture Department on March 1 projected apple
growers would make $588 million for the year, Ms. Lang said. The
actual income was $95 million less, she said.
   St. John said the 1988 record income illustrates how the Alar
scare primarily hurt sales of Red Delicious apples, which make up
69 percent of the state's crop. Alar is primarily used on red
apples.
   Prices have begun dropping again in recent weeks as the 1989
crop is harvested and shipped to market. A state Department of
Agriculture survey concluded earlier this week that no Alar was
used on the 1989 crop.

<HEAD>As America's Financial Empire Shrinks, Its Cultural Empire Grows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Rambo'' is a favorite video rental in Beirut.
Filipinos wear Ghostbusters T-shirts. Jerry Lewis is a cultural
hero in France.
   U.S. industry may be choking, but American cultural imperialism
seems to be growing ever stronger _ as Sony Corp.'s foray into
Hollywood this past week showed.
   Sony agreed to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and an
independent production company for a total of $3.6 billion because
it wanted the best in the world, and the best in the world in film
and television is American.
   Hollywood studios are in many ways the opposite of Japanese
manufacturers, yet they have discovered their own way to succeed in
the global marketplace.
   Japanese companies excel at churning out millions of perfectly
identical gadgets at the lowest possible price; American studios
release a handful of motion pictures a year, each one different
from the last, and spend extravagantly on each one.
   Japanese companies study each step they take at length;
Hollywood wheeler-dealers make deals over spritzers while ``doing''
lunch.
   Where Japanese companies employ people for life, Hollywood
studios fire chief executives routinely. The best people in
Hollywood operate with a freedom that is unheard of in Japan.
   Many business advice books tell American chief executives to
make their companies more like the Japanese. Maybe, though, the
answer is to be more like Hollywood.
   Hollywood, with all its peculiar personalities, may be a model
for the rest of American business for the 1990s, argues Howard
Suber, co-chairman of the film producers program at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
   Hollywood works because its best people, the ones who fight to
the top, know how to spot a trend and make money on it before other
people even see it coming, Suber said. That is a skill other
American businesses could stand to learn.
   ``People who are capable of turning on a dime have an
evolutionary advantage over dinosaurs who need six blocks to turn
right,'' Suber said.
   Suber's fellow chairman in the UCLA program is none other than
Peter Guber, the whirlwind Hollywood lawyer and dealmaker who is
widely expected to be named by Sony as the new chief of Columbia
Pictures.
   Suber said he is convinced that if Guber takes the job it will
be with complete artistic control, probably more than he would get
if Columbia were owned by an American company.
   Peter Guber ``has an absolute genius for perceiving value before
anybody else does,'' Suber said. Sony knows that any meddling would
``kill the golden goose for sure,'' he added.
   Sony says the same thing, noting that it has kept its hands off
the management of CBS Records after buying it for $2 billion.
   Japan's esprit de corps comes from cultural and ethnic sameness.
Hollywood's comes from the sharing of a dream _ to make a big movie
and get rich _ that is shared by people who flock from around the
world.
   In contrast to the image of poolside loungers, Hollywood is as
hectic and competitive as Wall Street or Chicago's LaSalle Street.
The UCLA film program accepts only about 7 percent of its
applicants, making it harder to get into than medical school. Even
those who get in have only a small chance of striking it rich.
   In the Darwinian world of film and television, hundreds of
projects die without being seen by a single viewer. A property that
looked hot goes cold by the time the movie is made, or a script
doesn't quite come together.
   The challenges of the unknown that Hollywood has learned to cope
with are becoming familiar to makers of computers and corn flakes:
As competition keeps getting tougher, people who delay decisions
until everything is certain will fall behind.
   ``You've got to have people who have an enormously high
tolerance for ambiguity,'' Suber said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The dollar plunged sharply against major foreign currencies
with a strong push from the central banks of the Group of Seven
industrialized democracies. The Group of Seven acted after agreeing
last weekend in Washington that the dollar had risen too much in
recent months, endangering the improvement in the U.S. trade
balance.
   _The House agreed to cut the capital gains tax, rejecting an
alternative proposal backed by Democratic leaders. The tax-cutting
measure, supported by President Bush, faces a fight in the Senate.
Democrat leaders said the cut would help mainly rich people, while
Republicans said it would promote investment and make the economy
stronger.
   _Braniff Inc. put itself under bankruptcy court protection for
the second time in seven years. The airline filed its petition
hours after canceling flights, sending workers home and leaving
travelers stranded in airports. The carrier, shrunken since its
first trip through bankruptcy court, ranks 13th in size in the
United States. Elsewhere in the airline business, the buyers of
Northwest Airlines agreed to restrict the participation of KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines in compliance with a government request.

<TEXT>
   Curt Carlson on Friday turned over to
his son-in law control of one of the nation's largest privately
held companies, a travel, restaurant and hotel empire Carlson began
more than 50 years ago from a trading stamp business.
   As has been expected for some time, Carlson turned over
day-to-day operation of his Carlson Companies Inc. to Edwin C.
``Skip'' Gage, who has been with the company for 21 years and will
become chief executive officer and president effective Monday.
   Carlson Companies, the nation's 15th-largest privately held
company, controls Radisson Hotels, Ask Mr. Foster travel agencies,
TGI Friday's and Country Kitchen restaurants and employs 55,000
people worldwide.
   Carlson, 75, said he would become chairman of the board of a
newly created company, Carlson Holdings Inc., that will include
Carlson Companies as one of its holdings.
   ``Skip Gage has been with me for over 20 years and at my side
for nearly all the key decisions I have made about the growth and
progress of this company,'' Carlson said in a prepared statement.
``It is time for me to let him take the helm of this $5
billion-plus company which has been my first love, after my family,
for the past 51 years.''
   Carlson started in business by himself in 1938 when he began the
Gold Bond Stamp Co. in Minneapolis after quitting a comfortable
sales job with Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   As stamps saturated the retail market, Carlson moved into other
growth areas. He structured the company into marketing, hospitality
and travel groups and, using internally generated profits and
borrowings, penetrated those areas.
   Gage, 48, joined Carlson Companies in 1968 when it was still the
Gold Bond Stamp Co. Gage, who has been chief operating officer of
Carlson Companies since 1983 and president since 1984, also was
named to the board of directors of Carlson Holdings.
   ``I am honored and appreciate Curt Carlson's confidence in me,''
said Gage. ``You do not replace a Curt Carlson and that is not my
intention. Rather, as my mentor, he has given me the tools and the
knowledge to take this company forward toward our goal of $9.2
billion in revenues in 1992.''
   Carlson also said he will now take time to write a book on
entrepreneurship and work more closely with the faculty and
students of the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management at the
University of Minnesota.
   Carlson made the announcement amid much fanfare Friday to about
1,000 of his 55,000 employees in the rotunda of Carlson Companies'
new world headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka.
   He and his wife, Arleen, plan a reception in honor of Gage and
his wife, Barbara, at a black-tie dinner Saturday night at the
headquarters. On Sunday, the Carlsons and Gages will host an open
house for 5,000 employees and their families.
   Two life-size cutouts of the two men with their hands extended
to shake hands will be available for pictures with employees who
might not get the opportunity to shake hands with each man,
according to a news release.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Hit 3-Month High on Stocks Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices climbed to three-month highs Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade following an Agriculture Department report
indicating U.S. wheat stocks were about 80 million bushels below
market expectations.
   On other commodity markets, corn and soybean futures retreated,
livestock and meat futures were mixed, energy futures were mostly
higher and precious metals declined.
   Wheat futures settled 2\ cents to 7} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.07\ a bushel, the highest
settlement for a near-month wheat contract since June 30.
   Corn was 1\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with December at
$2.33 a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2 cents lower with December
at $1.44 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with
November at $5.68 a bushel.
   In a report released after the close of trading Thursday, the
USDA projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990 at 1.91 billion
bushels compared to trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion.
   Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels
compared to trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion, and the USDA
estimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million bushels,
compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million.
   The USDA report provided the main support for the wheat market
but traders said a surge in in export sales of U.S. grains during
the week also helped boost wheat futures and limited losses in the
corn and soybean markets.
   ``All things considered, I think the market acted real good,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The USDA announced after the close that it had accepted bids
from exporters to cover the sale of 270,000 metric tons of wheat to
China at subsidized prices, and market analysts said Egypt was
seeking to buy 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   The USDA also announced that 150,000 metric tons of corn had
been sold to unknown destinations, which is often interpreted as a
sale to the Soviet Union.
   Rumors that the Soviets were seeking to buy U.S. corn had given
corn futures a lift on Thursday.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the USDA's quarterly hogs-and-pigs
report, which estimated the U.S. swine herd as of Sept. 1 at 58.4
million head, about the same as last year and very close to market
expectations.
   But analysts said near-term hog futures may open lower Monday in
reaction to another section of the report that showed pork
producers had kept slightly more hogs for marketing than traders
had expected.
   The hog report was perceived as slightly bullish for the
deferred contracts, though, because it indicated pork producers had
backed off a bit on their fall breeding intentions, which would
imply a smaller supply of hogs next spring and summer.
   ``For the short term, the report was a little tinge negative,
for the long term, bullish,'' said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle settled .45 cent lower to .03 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in October at 71.92 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .40 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October at 82.95
cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .38 cent higher with
October at 43.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent
to .68 cent lower with February at 48.22 cents a pound.
   Most energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as traders were encouraged by OPEC's ability to reach an
agreement to limit production.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents lower to 27
cents higher with November at $20.13 a barrel; heating oil was .43
cent to .77 cent higher with October at 59.44 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .53 cent lower to .65 cent higher with
October at 60.40 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures fell moderately on New York's Commodity
Exchange, despite a drop in the dollar, amid pre-weekend
profit-taking.
   Gold futures ended 30 cents to 90 cents lower with October at
$367.20 a troy ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 4 cents lower with
October at $5.226 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>SEC Sues Two in `Yuppie Five' Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
seeking illegal profits and civil penalties of more than $668,000
from two men who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the ``Yuppie
Five'' insider trading case.
   In a complaint filed Monday, the SEC alleged that Morton
Shapiro, 27, of Boston, and Daniel J. Silverman, 26, of North
Providence, R.I., made profits of $167,069 in the scheme with a
lawyer and two Wall Street professionals.
   The complaint asks for a return of the illegal profits and civil
penalties of up to three times $167,069, for a total of more than
$668,000.
   When the criminal case was first brought in 1986, the five men
all were in their 20s and were nicknamed the ``Yuppie Five.'' They
pleaded guilty to various criminal charges and all but Shapiro and
Silverman previously settled with the SEC.
   The ringleader was Michael David, formerly an associate at the
prominent New York law firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp;
Garrison.
   David was accused of stealing non-public information about
proposed or anticipated corporate takeovers from his employees and
passing it on to Shapiro, a former stockbroker; Silverman, one of
Shapiro's customers; and Robert Salsbury and Andrew Solomon, both
arbitrage analysts.
   In the criminal case, Shapiro was sentenced to two months in
prison and a $25,000 fine. Silverman drew three years probation and
a $25,000 fine.

   The dollar resumed its decline Friday under
pressure of a fifth straight day of dollar sales by central bankers.
   After rising slightly on Thursday, the dollar fell to its lowest
level since late July.
   The U.S. currency has lost more than 4 percent of its value
against the West German mark and Japanese yen since last weekend's
agreement by the Group of Seven industrialized democracies that the
dollar's recent rise was ``inconsistent with longer run economic
fundamentals.''
   The seven nations in the group are the United States, Britain,
Japan, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   Central banks have succeeded in getting the dollar down below
140 Japanese yen and 1.9 West German marks, which many traders
believe is the ceiling the banks have established. But traders were
not confident that the central banks' intervention was over.
   ``There's a lot of fear of the central banks,'' said one
Frankfurt trader. ``They have shown that they are going to be
permanently there. They've earned respect.''
   ``All the old theory of the foreign exchange market taking on
the central banks is fine when you have an insatiable demand for
dollars,'' but that is not the case now, said Marc Cohen, a trader
at Republic National Bank of New York.
   Intervention was lighter than in other days. The Bank of England
intervened in London and the Federal Reserve stepped in during U.S.
trading.
   In Tokyo, the dollar eased to 139.35 Japanese yen from 140.85
yen on Thursday. Late Friday in London, the dollar traded at 139.57
yen. In New York the dollar traded at 139.05 yen, down from 140.50
Thursday.
   In London the pound rose to $1.6150 from Thursday's late
$1.6085. In New York, the pound rose to $1.6195 from $1.6107.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8720 West German marks, down from
1.8818; 1.6220 Swiss francs, down from 1.6308; 1.1770 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1800; 6.3500 French francs, down from 6.3760;
and 1,365 Italian lire, down from 1,370.5.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8715 West German marks, down
from 1.8810; 1.6225 Swiss francs, down from 1.6310; 6.3535 French
francs, down from 6.3735; 2.1090 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1315;
1,363.825 Italian lire, down from 1.369.00; and 1.7183 Canadian
dollars down from 1.1803.
   Gold prices rose early in the day as the dollar weakened but
later fell on profit-taking as the dollar showed a modest recovery.
   The late bid for gold in London was $367.00 a troy ounce, up
from $366.50 late Thursday. The Zurich late bid was $366.50 an
ounce, up from Thursday's $366.35.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $369.15 a troy ounce, up
from Thursday's $366.35.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $367.20 an ounce from $368.10. Later Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $366.25 an ounce,
down from $366.90.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.23 a troy
ounce, down from $5.27 late Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.226 from $5.265.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Recoup Some Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rebounded late Friday after
sustaining modest losses earlier in the day as investors continued
to keep a close watch on the dollar.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 7-32 point, or about
$2.20 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which falls when the price
rises, slipped to 8.23 percent from 8.25 percent late Thursday.
   The U.S. currency was pummeled as central banks for the fifth
straight day intervened to drive the dollar lower.
   Bond prices, which have been tracking the dollar's fortunes,
continued their downward progress in early dealings. But bonds
recouped some of their losses as the session wore on and volume
fizzled.
   ``The lower the dollar went the less momentum bonds had on the
downside. That's a good sign,'' said Marilyn Cohen, of the
investment firm Capital Insight in Beverly Hills, Calif. ``It
suggests that most of the selling is done for now.''
   The dollar stabilized late in the day after an overnight
decline. That helped sooth bond traders, who worry that a big slide
in the dollar will erode the international value of their holdings.
   Economists said there was little market reaction to a 0.3
percent increase in the government's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators for August, the second straight advance that pointed to
continued economic growth in the coming months.
   The increase in the index, which signals the future direction of
economic activity, followed a 0.1 percent gain in July. It declined
0.1 percent in June.
   Maria F. Ramirez, managing director and money market economist
for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the market was indifferent to
the figure, which reinforced a belief that the Fed would not relax
monetary policy in the near term.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
bonds were unchanged, intermediate securities were as much as 3-32
point higher and long-term issues advanced as much as 7-32 point,
according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was 1.10 higher at 1,169.74.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, added
0.08 to 329.32.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 5-32 point to 91{. The average yield to
maturity slipped to 7.47 percent from 7.48 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills edged up to 8.15 percent as
the discount added 1 basis point to 7.89 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 8.29 percent as the discount advanced 3
basis points to 7.86 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.45
percent as the discount gained 2 basis points to 7.85 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge on
overnight loans to one another, fell to 8{ percent after peaking at
9} percent during the day. The rate was 9\ percent late Thursday.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. stock plunged Friday
amid warnings that the $1.1 billion paid for its theme parks would
do little to relieve the publisher's debt.
   Harcourt's stock price dropped more than 25 percent on the New
York Stock Exchange, falling $4.12{ a share to $12.12{.
   The Orlando-based textbook publisher took on $2.9 billion in
debt to fend off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by British
communications mogul Robert Maxwell, and analysts say it now finds
itself squeezed to pay off the interest.
   Analysts had hoped Orlando-based Harcourt would get $1.5 billion
to $2 billion for the four Sea World and two other parks it sold to
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. on Thursday.
   The $1.1 billion sale price will net Harcourt about $930 million.
   ``I think people's expectations were too high for the selling
price of the theme parks,'' Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. analyst
Robert Dunlap said.
   When Harcourt first announced the intended sale, the company's
stock soared from $10 to $18.
   Dunlap said the sale would lower Harcourt's $346.6 million in
annual interest payments by $115 million.
   But the loss of the parks will cut into the income Harcourt
needs to pay the debts; as of June 30, the parks accounted for
$68.3 million of the company's $216.8 million in annual earnings,
and that share had been expected to increase.
   ``They don't have enough money to pay the interest,'' Dunlap
said. He said Harcourt needs to reduce annual interest payments to
under $150 million _ either by lowering payments another $80
million or selling assets of $800 million.
   Dunlap speculated that Harcourt could sell its insurance arm,
but other analysts said even that will not be enough.
   ``They don't have that much more to sell. Ultimately, they will
have to issue more equity,'' says Bert Boksen of Raymond, James &amp;
Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg.
   That will help reduce the debt but will dilute share values even
further, he said.
   ``We're still recommending selling the stock,'' Boksen said.
``We think it's worth somewhere near $8 to $9 a share.''
   He said Harcourt's breakup value is about $14 a share, and stock
in publishers should sell at about 60 percent of that price.
   Boksen added that more bad news may be in store for Harcourt,
noting that school publishing sales for all publishers were soft in
the third quarter.
   Harcourt officials did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
   Harcourt's popular Sea World parks, which feature performing
killer whales such as Shamu, trained dolphins and other talented
creatures from the sea, are located in San Diego, Orlando, San
Antonio and Aurora, Ohio.
   The other parks involved in the deal are Boardwalk and Baseball
in Orlando and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven. The purchase also
includes land adjacent to the three Florida parks, Sea World of
Texas and Orlando International Airport.
   Overall attendance at the six parks was 14.5 million last year.
   Prior to the theme park deal, Harcourt had annual sales of $1.5
billion, with the parks accounting for $388 million. The company
employed 17,500 people before the sale.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp. and Imperial Corp.
of America are selling big credit-card portfolios, continuing a
consolidation in which a few big companies are specializing in
consumer credit cards.
   As part of a restructuring, First Interstate said it would sell
a portfolio of Mastercard and Visa accounts worth about $450
million to Associates Corp. of North America, a Dallas commercial
and consumer finance company.
   Wells Fargo agreed Thursday to buy the $280 million credit-card
portfolio held by Imperial, the parent company of Imperial Savings
in San Diego. Imperial said it expected to receive a 24 percent
premium, or $67 million, on its sale, and predicted it would post a
big fourth-quarter gain as a result.
   First Interstate, the parent of Los Angeles-based First
Interstate Bank, did not disclose the premium paid by Associates.
   But premiums for the portfolios _ basically payments for
consumers' trust in the cards and future business using them _ have
been running in the 20 percent range, which in this case would
yield $90 million.
   First Interstate said it expects to post an after-tax profit of
$44 million on the deal.
   The sale does not represent all of First Interstate's
credit-card operations. Customers, whose accounts are serviced by
First Interstate Bancard in Simi Valley, are located largely
outside of California.
   First Interstate Bank will continue to offer credit cards to its
customers.

   The government said its chief forecasting
gauge turned up in August for the second straight month, another
sign the nation's economy is likely to grow modestly at least into
next year.
   The Commerce Department said Friday its Index of Leading
Indicators climbed 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent
in July and falling 0.1 percent in June. The back-to-back
July-August advance was consistent with expectations of many
analysts who foresee the current economic expansion reaching its
seventh birthday in December and continuing into 1990.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission on Friday
approved the proposed sale of the Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western
Railway line between Chicago and East St. Louis, a major step in
the carrier's reorganization.
   The deal, which still must be approved by a U.S. bankruptcy
judge in Chicago, would give the route to Rio Grande Industries
Inc., a railroad company in San Francisco that has been seeking a
foothold in Illinois.
   Under the proposal, Rio Grande would pay $22 million and assume
$7 million of CM&amp;W debt owed to various state agencies. Rio Grande
told the government it would eliminate 187 of the 360 CM&amp;W jobs on
the line.
   ``Whatever happens in bankruptcy court will probably happen soon
because CM&amp;W is in a tough cash position,'' said George W. Mayo
Jr., attorney for Rio Grande.
   The route is used mainly for freight, but Amtrak also uses it to
run three daily round-trip runs between Chicago and St. Louis and
two between Chicago and Springfield.
   In making its decision, the ICC considered objections from
competing railroads, including Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co. and Illinois Central Railroad Co.
   Both handle freight for railroads owned by Rio Grande _ business
they are likely to lose if the deal is approved in bankruptcy court
and Rio Grande gains access to the line. Illinois Central said it
would lose $7.2 million per year.
   The ICC was not swayed.
   ``We conclude that the ... acquisition of CM&amp;W's line ... will
not result in a substantial lessening of competition, creation of a
monopoly or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in
the region,'' the order said.
   ``The transfer will also assure continued operation by Amtrak
over its third heaviest volume line. ... The state has made a
substantial investment in the line,'' the ICC said. ``Sale to (Rio
Grande) will secure this investment.''
   Under the proposed deal with Rio Grande, CM&amp;W would still retain
its Kansas City, Mo.-East St. Louis route; track between Greene
County and Springfield; a 50 percent interest in the Godfrey-East
St. Louis line, and all locomotives and cars.
   CM&amp;W was created in 1986 to be an independent regional railroad.
In April 1988, the railroad filed for bankruptcy reorganization and
the case is pending before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John
Schwartz in Chicago.
   Creditors, primarily Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller
Financial Inc., are owed more than $100 million. They want
immediate liquidation of the railroad, while Daniel Murray, the
court-appointed trustee, supports the Rio Grande deal.
   Neal Wolf, an attorney representing Citicorp, and Murray could
not be reached for comment Friday on the ICC decision.
   CM&amp;W is wrangling with its creditors over $13.9 million in loans
and grants given to the railroad by the state of Illinois.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen prevented CM&amp;W from using the
money, but that ruling has been appealed to a higher court.

   Fewer Americans made late payments on their
bank and home mortgage loans in the April-June quarter, two trade
associations reported this week.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said 4.52 percent of
outstanding mortgage loans on one-to-four-unit residential
properties were more than 30 days past due, down from 4.62 percent
in the in the first quarter.
   It was second consecutive quarterly decline and the lowest level
in 10 years, the trade group said.
   The foreclosure rate blipped up from 0.32 percent in the first
quarter to 0.37 percent in the second. The association, noting that
the foreclosure rate generally follows the trend of the delinquency
rate, said it expected that foreclosures to fall.
   The MBA surveyed 13.5 million loans, representing about a third
of all outstanding mortgages.
   Meanwhile, the American Bankers Association said the delinquency
rate on installment loans at commercial banks fell to 2.30 percent
at the end of the April-June period, down from 2.39 percent at the
end of March and 2.49 percent at the end of December.
   The percentage represents a composite for seven different types
of loans: personal, direct auto, indirect auto, mobile home,
recreational vehicle, property improvement and home equity.
   Although the economy's growth has slowed this year, analysts
take the falling delinquency rates as a sign that consumer income
and employment are still strong.
   The ABA surveys loans in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the
District of Columbia.

   Harris Graphics Corp., citing a large
drop in demand for new printing presses, Friday announced the
closing of a century-old factory, throwing about 300 people out of
work.
   The company said about 40 people in engineering, sales and
service will continue to operate out of Stonington, where Harris
Graphics made parts for its web offset presses. About 50 other
employees are to be offered jobs at other Harris Graphics plants.
   The printing press plant, which became part of Harris Graphics
in the early 1980s, had been in operation for more than 100 years.
   Harris Graphics also has plants in Dover, N.H., site of its
corporate headquarters, and in Fort Worth, Texas, and has a small
factory in Saltillo, Mexico.
   The company had been scaling down the size of its workforce in
Stonington in recent years, and only two months ago laid off 165
employees.

equipment market in the United States.
   Asea Brown also will buy Westinghouse's interests in
subsidiaries serving the electricial transmission and distribution
markets in Brazil and Argentina, which also are jointly owned with
ABB, Westinghouse said.
   The Westinghouse ABB Power T&amp;D Co. will have 1989 sales of about
$1 billion, Westinghouse said. It employs about 10,000 people at 25
facilities.
   ``This transaction enables Westinghouse to focus its resources
in the energy field on the market segments where our capabilities
can best be utilized,'' said Westinghouse Chairman John C. Marous.
``These include the nuclear energy and power generation businesses,
where we expect considerable growth over the next decade and
beyond.''
   ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., based in Zurich, was formed Jan. 1,
1988, with the merger of Asea AB of Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri
Ltd. of Switzerland.
