<HEAD>Mitterrand Stays Out of Missile Modernization Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand, wary of getting
caught up in the divisive NATO debate over modernization of
short-range nuclear missiles, said Thursday the allies still have
time to think about it.
   Speaking at a news conference at the presidential palace,
Mitterrand stressed that though France was a loyal member of the
NATO, it was not apart of the alliance's integrated military
command from which President Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966.
   As such, he said, France is not directly concerned in the
missile debate.
   However, he noted he was ``satisfied'' that U.S. and German
officials ``seem to have decided that if there is to be
modernization, there is time to discuss it between now and 1992,
this date being the point after which there would be aging, and
thus imbalance.''
   He said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in
Brussels later this month would be discussing the issue, which he
would talk about with President Bush this weekend in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   The West German government has asked the United States to start
talks with the Soviet Union on eliminating short-range nuclear
weapons. The United States had said it had no plans to do so.
   Mitterrand said the allies must be able to verify the real state
of the Soviet Union's modernized forces, adding ``all modernization
on on side would lead automatically to a modernization on the
other.''
   The president said he would be willing to eliminate France's
nuclear arsenal if the United States and the Soviet Union renounce
theirs.
   France also is going ahead with modernization of its own
short-range nuclear missiles, which the president said were neither
theater nor tactical weapons, but ``only a weapon of ultimate
warning.''

<TEXT>
   Shoes shiny as mirrors, white teeth framed in
sincere smiles and fingers groping for buttonholes, members of the
American League of Lobbyists gathered to practice their
bread-and-butter art of schmoozing.
   Lobbyists seem to be everywhere in Washington, trying to
influence legislators or government policy-makers to give their
clients a break. It's a tough job, especially if the client is
unsavory or his cause unpopular. Often, success depends on knowing
whose name to drop, which elbow to squeeze.
   It also can be highly lucrative. ``We don't starve,'' said
public relations executive Marc L. Apter, whose diverse clients
include State Farm Insurance and the West African nation of Togo.
   Apter was lobbying the lobbyists for business Thursday when more
than 100 members of the league _ representing special-interest
groups from Mobil Oil Corp. to the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association to Girl Scouts of the USA _ held their
annual conference here.
   They dutifully attended lobbying workshops on taxes, labor
unions, the environment, foreign trade and Medicare. But they
seemed happiest when they were schmoozing over cocktails and lunch.
   It's such idle chatter that sometimes yields valuable tips and
contacts in Washington's network of influence salesmen.
   Among these garrulous birds, the usual plumage seems to be dark
blue suit, white shirt and red or yellow ``power tie.'' Hair is
trimmed tidily short. Laughter is boisterous, but when the talk
turns serious, lobbyists crouch forward from the waist and stare in
each other's eyes.
   Their hands flutter in the air, jingle pocket change, brush
foreheads, clamp onto hips, yank at noses. With hardly a break in
the chatter or a sideways glance, they extract business cards from
coats or wallets _ already bulging with other people's business
cards _ to exchange for yet another.
   What makes a good lobbyist?
   Eugene F. Rowan has been one for 15 years. He was J.C. Penney's
vice president for federal government relations until he retired a
few years ago to become a free-lance lobbyist, using an office in
the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow. His biggest client
is the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, whose president
is former Nixon White House press secretary Ronald Ziegler.
   ``First of all, you've got to have credibility. Your word must
be something that a member of Congress can rely on. You can't
misrepresent anything,'' Rowan said.
   ``It's crucial that you know your subject matter. And you have
to be able to live and deal with the culture of Capitol Hill. Most
of the time you don't control the agenda or the timetable, which
frustrates a lot of business executives. Availability is important.
You only see Sen. Sorghum when he wants to see you.
   ``You have to be a good salesperson, really. You try to make eye
contact and keep it. It's important to be natural. No poses or
role-playing or backslapping. They are very good at seeing through
that kind of thing.''
   Rowan deftly snatched a business card from his overstuffed
wallet. ``There's nothing worse than being caught on the Hill
without a card,'' he said.
   In a room full of conservative neckties, Rowan was the only
lobbyist who wore a bow tie.
   Was this part of his shtick?
   ``No,'' he replied. ``I can't spill gravy on this tie.''

   George ``Specs'' Toporcer, the
first non-pitcher to wear eyeglasses in a major-league ballgame,
died Wednesday after a fall. He was 90.
   Toporcer went straight from semi-pro baseball to the St. Louis
Cardinals in 1921, breaking in as a utility infielder. During an
eight-year career with the Cards, he played all four infield
positions but spent most of his time at shortstop.
   Toporcer posted a lifetime batting average of .279 and appeared
in one game during the 1926 World Series, which the Cardinals won
in seven games over the New York Yankees.
   After finishing his career with the Cards, Toporcer became a
minor-league manager until his eyesight totally failed in 1951. He
wrote an autobiography called ``Baseball From Backlots to Big
Leagues.''

<HEAD>Atlantan Files Suit Against Rob Lowe for `Porn' Video</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta resident has accused actor Rob Lowe in
a civil lawsuit of making sexual videotapes with a minor female.
   The lawsuit contends the 25-year-old actor ``used his celebrity
status as an inducement to females to engage in sexual intercourse,
sodomy and multiple party sexual activity for his immediate sexual
gratification and for the purpose of making pornographic films of
these activities.''
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Fulton County State Court, alleges
that Lowe seduced a minor into appearing in the tapes with him and
another person while he was in Atlanta for last summer's Democratic
National Convention.
   Lowe has starred in such movies as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and
``About Last Night.''
   A copy of the lawsuit was obtained by television station WGNX in
Atlanta before it was sealed, at the request of Lowe's attorney,
within an hour of its filing Friday. The name of the plaintiff was
not available Thursday night.
   County District Attorney Lewis Slaton said he has a copy of the
videotape and is reviewing it to determine whether criminal charges
would be filed.
   The civil lawsuit asks for unspecified punitive damages for
emotional harm inflicted upon the female.
   An agent for Lowe said late Thursday that the actor and his
manager, Tim Wood, were out of the country Thursday and couldn't be
reached for comment by telephone.
   Lowe's attorney in Atlanta, Edgar Neely III, did not return
telephone calls Thursday night.

<HEAD>Uniform Poll-Closings Bill Clears Senate Committee Hurdle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polling places across the nation would close
at 10 p.m. EST in presidential elections under a plan approved by a
Senate panel in a move to prevent networks from announcing
projected results before all ballots are cast.
   The bill was part of a package that cleared the Senate Rules and
Administration Committee on Wednesday, with Chairman Wendell Ford,
D-Ky., saying it would make ``a much needed change in our federal
election system.''
   Other bills in the package would replace the current
presidential primary system with eight regional primaries and make
it illegal for lawmakers to pocket leftover campaign funds.
   Lawmakers elected in this decade already are barred from
converting campaign funds to their personal use. An exemption for
those who came to Capitol Hill before 1980 would be abolished under
the Senate legislation.
   Committee action on the poll-closing bill sets the stage for a
possible clash with the House, which already has passed a rival
version.
   Under the Senate bill, polls nationwide except in Alaska and
Hawaii would close at 10 p.m. EST. That proposal is preferred by
transportation companies, which say it would leave their schedules
intact.
   Under the House bill, daylight-saving time would be extended in
the Pacific time zone long enough to take in the presidential
election. The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash.,
would set poll-closing times at 9 p.m. EST, 8 p.m. CST, 7 p.m. MST
and 7 p.m. PDT.
   Airlines have been lobbying against the House proposal, saying
it would force them to skew their timetables in a variety of ways.
   Democratic Sens. Brock Adams of Washington and Donald W. Riegle
Jr. of Michigan are co-sponsors of the Senate version.
   The 1980 presidential election put the spotlight on the issue of
poll closings when networks called Ronald Reagan as the winner over
Jimmy Carter while voters in many states still were on their way to
vote.
   Politicians still debate whether then-Rep. Al Ullman, D-Ore.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, lost his bid for
re-election because the early projections discouraged many Oregon
Democrats from voting.
   In any case, many Americans were infuriated and felt the early
projections made their votes seem futile, according to sponsors of
the legislation.
   ``I believe early projections before the polls close threaten
the right of some voters to go to the polls and feel their votes
count,'' Adams said.
   Network projections are based on polls of voters as they leave
the polling places rather than on the official vote count, but such
exit polls have been shown to be highly accurate.
   Networks have agreed to refrain from projecting the winner in
any state until the polls close in that state. That pledge,
however, leaves the door open for networks to forecast the next
occupant of the White House with millions of Americans still to
vote.
   The regional primary bill is aimed at diminishing what critics
call the lopsided influence on the nomination process of Iowa's
early caucuses and New Hampshire's early primary.
   Nothing similar is moving in the House, and calls for a regional
primary system have been sparse lately.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told lawmakers he was voting
against the bill because ``it would turn the presidential campaign
into purely a television advertising event and take away caucuses
and other remnants of the politics of the past, which I would hate
to see go.''
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., would divide
the nation into eight regions, the first of which would have its
presidential primary on the first Tuesday of March. The rest would
hold their primaries every other Tuesday thereafter.
   The Federal Election Commission would determine the order of the
primaries by lot and no region would be able to go first in two
successive elections. The regions would be composed as follows:
   Region 1: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Region 2: Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware. Region 3: Kentucky, Tennessee,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, the
District of Columbia and Maryland.
   Region 4: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
Florida, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Region 5: Wisconsin,
Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. Region 6: Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota and
Minnesota.
   Region 7: Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana,
Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. Region 8: California, Nevada,
Guam, Hawaii and American Samoa.

<HEAD>Ground-Breaking Cancer Experiments Expected to Begin Within Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within weeks, scientists at the National
Institutes for Health expect to begin splicing genes from a
bacteria into the cells of dying cancer patients in hopes of
developing a new therapy for fighting the disease.
   The experiment _ until now conducted only with a few species of
plants and animals _ will break new ground for science as the first
authorized human gene transplant.
   But it will mark only a first step toward equipping cells with
cancer-fighting genes.
   ``We're going full speed ahead,'' said Steven A. Rosenberg, one
of three NIH researchers who have been preparing for more than a
year for the experiment. ``We have not yet transferred the cells
into any patient but we expect to do that within the next several
weeks.''
   The experiment was approved last January by the institute's
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, but at the same time a lawsuit
was filed by the Foundation on Economic Trends and its president,
Jeremy Rifkin.
   The suit was settled Tuesday with an NIH advisory committee
agreeing to keep its deliberations and votes on human gene research
open to the public.
   Researchers said the litigation did not hold up their work.
Rather, the scientists said, they have moved more slowly than
expected because of technical factors related to setting up the
complex experiment, including finding appropriate patients and
conducting an array of safety tests.
   ``This is the very first time this is being done and we wanted
to make sure everything was absolutely ideal because these patients
are going to be under the microscope of a lot of people, so we've
taken longer than initially anticipated,'' said R. Michael Blaese,
one of the researchers.
   He added: ``We've been very close for some time.''
   Rosenberg, Blaese and W. French Anderson will conduct the
experiment with 10 patients who have advanced melanoma, a deadly
skin cancer, and a life expectancy of 90 days.
   In earlier work, Rosenberg showed that a type of immune cell,
called tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL, can be used to fight
cancer. He removed TIL cells from a patient's tumor, grew them in
large numbers in the laboratory and then reinserted them into the
patient.
   In 12 of 20 patients, the technique was at least partially
successful.
   Now, the question is why it works in some people but not others,
and the researchers believe that if they can find that answer, they
can learn to design TILs to be more effective.
   In this experiment, they will introduce a bacterial gene into
the cells to mark them so their movement in the body can be
monitored. Though the TILs may benefit the patient, the gene being
transplanted will not attack the melanoma.
   The procedure has very little risk to the patient, Blaese said.
   ``The initial studies will introduce genes that help us traffic
the cells and study their survival, but subsequent studies already
being done in the laboratory are designed to increase the
anti-cancer effectiveness of the cells by putting in new genes,''
Rosenberg said in an interview Wednesday. ``The major significance
(of the studies) to us now is in attempting to develop a better
cancer therapy.''
   As a technique in general, gene therapy offers an approach to
disease treatment that is quite different from the current methods
using drugs, radiation or surgery, he said.
   ``It is changing the very fabric of the genetic material of the
cells to give it new properties to combat disease or overcome
defects that lead to disease,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Wednesday he wanted to reach an accommodation with West Germany
over nuclear missiles, but insisted the weapons were an essential
deterrent to Soviet attack.
   Baker took the hard-line stance as he awaited the arrival of
West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, who was headed
here from Bonn for meetings with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Thursday and Baker on Friday.
   Stoltenberg also will meet with Brent Scowcroft, the national
security assistant to President Bush. Scowcroft has expressed
concern about lowering NATO's nuclear capability.
   Baker indicated he did not intend to give ground and said he
hoped the West German official would bring ``an evolving position''
from Bonn.
   The West German government, supported by several of the NATO
allies, is pushing for negotiations between the United States and
the Soviet Union to reduce and possibly eliminate nuclear missiles
on both sides with a range of up to 300 miles.
   Baker said the missiles have helped keep the peace with the
Soviet Union for nearly 40 years and were essential as a deterrent
to war.
   ``We would like to find a way to bridge this gap,'' Baker said
on a U.S. government-sponsored telecast to Western Europe. ``But we
want to find a way that is consistent with maintaining our resolve,
with maintaining our will, with maintaining our strength, with
maintaining the strategy of flexible response which has provided
Europe with peace for 40 years.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl telephoned President Bush on
Tuesday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. Although
Fitzwater gave no details of the call, The New York Times reported
in its Thursday editions that Kohl indicated his government was
willing to take a more flexible approach on the missile question.
   The newspaper, citing unidentified Western diplomats, said that
under the new approach, talks on short-range missiles might not
begin until significant progress was made in reducing conventional
arms in Europe, where the Soviet bloc has a large advantage.
   The West German government also is resisting a joint
U.S.-British effort to more than triple the range of Lance missiles
to just below 300 miles. All U.S. and Soviet missiles with ranges
between 300 and 3,000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty.
   The U.S.-built Lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles.
Most of the 88 launchers, carrying about 700 single-warhead
missiles, are based in West Germany.
   Baker said he understood the West Germans' concern that their
country might become a battlefield in a tactical nuclear war
between East and West. But he said the Warsaw Pact had a big edge
in short-range nuclear weapons and had been making them more potent.
   ``Nuclear weapons are part of a defensive strategy,'' Baker said
of NATO's rocket arsenal. ``We ought to move very, very slowly
before we abandon that strategy.''
   Under questioning from West European correspondents, Baker did
not predict a resolution of the rift with West Germany before the
summit meeting is held in Brussels May 29-30. Bush will attend with
the leaders of the 15 other NATO governments.
   Baker said he hoped Stoltenberg would bring some new approaches
from Bonn.
   ``For the most part,'' Baker said, ``we'll be listening to
Gerhard Stoltenberg when he comes to Washington to see what he has
to say. We are very interested in what we hope will be an evolving
position by the West German government on this issue.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We're still discussing the matter. We continue to hope that
we could reach some kind of agreement before the NATO summit; but
if not, we'll discuss it there or later.''
   He added, ``We don't want to speculate on what we might accept.
Our position has always been: first, we should proceed with the
conventional arms talks until we can achieve a parity, and then
we'll discuss or address the situation with regards to SNF. We are
not prepared to go beyond that at this point.''

   A dozen workers installing track in a subway
tunnel were injured Wednesday, three of them seriously burned, when
a section of new rail touched the 600-volt electrified third rail,
the Transit Authority said.
   Two of the burned workers were in critical but stable condition,
and the third was in serious condition, said Kathy McGowan, a
spokeswoman for New York Hospital-Cornell Burn Center.
   The other nine workers were treated at two hospitals and
discharged.
   The workers were installing a 26-foot rail between two stations
in Brooklyn and had placed a protective rubber mat across the third
rail.
   Apparently ``the rail they were installing somehow slit the mat
and came in contact with the third rail,'' said Caren Gardner, a TA
spokeswoman. The mat was sent for testing to determine it was
slashed, she said.
   It is standard operating practice not to shut off electricity to
the third rail while crews are installing a single rail, Ms.
Gardner said.
   The Transit Authority will convene a board of inquiry on Friday.

<HEAD>Administration Split Over Driftnet Treaty Surfaces During Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major foreign policy split within the Bush
Administration over a tentative driftnet fishing agreement with
Japan spilled into public view Wednesday before the Senate Commerce
Committee.
   A State Department official told the committee that the
monitoring and enforcement agreement represented an ``important
first step'' toward regulating the driftnet fishing fleets in the
North Pacific.
   But a Commerce Department official said he thought the treaty
was inadequate and contained too many unanswered questions.
   Japan, along with South Korea and Taiwan, faces possible trade
sanctions on its fishery products imported into the United States
if driftnet agreements aren't signed by June 29.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher will have to decide whether
the treaty with the Japanese meets the requirements of the Driftnet
Act passed by Congress in 1987 or whether the administration should
pursue trade sanctions.
   Lawmakers from Washington state, Alaska and Oregon have urged
the administration to renegotiate the treaty, while the Northwest
fishing industry and environmentalists have been highly critical of
the agreement, which covers only one year.
   An estimated 700 to 1,000 fishing vessels from Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan use driftnets in the North Pacific, ostensibly to
catch squid. The monofilament, small-mesh nets, which can stretch
more than 30 miles in length, hang in the water snaring virtually
any mammal, bird or fish that come in contact with them.
   On any given day, the nets can cover more than 30,000 miles of
ocean.
   U.S. fishermen insist the driftnet fleets are intentionally
catching salmon under the guise of harvesting squid. Salmon runs in
Alaska, Washington state and Oregon have dropped sharply as a
result of the illegal fishing, they say.
   Environmentalists charge that driftnets kill thousands of
porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life annually.
   The treaty would provide for 32 observers to be placed aboard
the 460 Japanese vessels that use driftnets, and increase from four
to five the number of Japanese patrol boats in the vast area where
driftnet fishing is legal.
   The Japanese refused to participate in a pilot program proposed
by the United States to track their vessel locations by satellite,
and indicated they were unilaterally expanding the legal driftnet
fishing zone 120 miles north.
   The legal zone was designed to keep the driftnet fleets well
away from the traditional migration routes of North American salmon.
   ``The driftnet agreement with Japan represents an important
first step in this process and, we hope, will be followed by the
conclusion of driftnet monitoring and enforcement programs for the
driftnet fisheries of Korea and Taiwan as well,'' said Richard
Smith, a principal deputy assistant secretary at the State
Department.
   ``If that happens, the first body bag would carry the remains of
the best monitoring agreement we've ever had,'' said Smith, adding
that while he was aware of the ``frustration and anger''
surrounding the driftnet issue, the treaty was the ``path of
cooperation.''
   State Department sources, who asked not to be named, said
disagreement exists within the department over whether the treaty
should be signed to avoid a possible trade war or whether it was
time to get tough with the Japanese.
   William Evans, a Commerce Department under secretary for oceans
and atmosphere, told the committee he was not satisfied with the
treaty.
   ``I believe it falls way short of the mark,'' said Evans.

<HEAD>Consultant Defends Fees Earned Under Embattled Housing Program</HEAD>

   Consultants who collected big fees for work
connected to a federally subsidized housing program told a
congressional panel the payments were justified, as senators
complained the program was riddled with improprieties.
   Former Massachusetts Sen. Edward Brooke, who received $183,000
for consulting work on two low-income housing projects in
Massachusetts, told a Senate committee Wednesday that he ``had no
special pipeline'' into the Department of Housing and Department to
influence contract awards under the housing program.
   Brooke also said it was ``understandable'' that developers
sought assistance in competing for financing under the Moderate
Rehabilitation Program, which he said was under-funded.
   Brooke and three other consultants appeared Wednesday before the
Banking Committee. It was the first time they had testified
publicly since they were named in a highly-critical report by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's inspector general.
   The report found the low-income housing renovation program was
poorly managed and its undocumented selection process was riddled
with favoritism.
   The document alleged developers and housing authorites seeking
money for projects selected consultants who did little more for the
unusually high fees than make a few phone calls or write to their
former colleagues.
   ``Not only did I advise clients on HUD policies and procedures,
but on state and local programs, and tax and housing legislative
changes affecting low-income housing development and financing,''
said Brooke.
   ``There were not only a few calls but dozens and dozens of calls
over a period of four years,'' he said.
   Brooke said he had ``no influence in the (Reagan)
administration'' and hadn't known any of the HUD officials he dealt
with before he met or spoke with them in connection with the two
projects.
   Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., called the consultant
contracts a form of ``looting'' that demonstrated a disturbing
pattern at HUD.
   ``I want to find out about every project that was done in the
country. I don't want just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Riegle,
calling for a review of all projects awarded contracts through the
program during the 1984-1988 period covered by the inspector
general's audit.
   The inspector general said no evidence of criminal wrongdoing
has been discovered in the audit, but the report has been referred
to the Justice Department for review.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp last month suspended 1989 funding
for the program following release of the inspector general's report
and said Tuesday that he would restart the program next month and
issue new guidelines.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., on Wednesday introduced
a bill that would establish regulations for a competitive award
process, give the housing secretary greater control over the use of
low-income housing tax credit and provide for annual updating of
the handbook used by field offices that administer the program.
   Judith S. Siegel, a Rhode Island developer who paid former
Interior Secretary James Watt $300,000 as a consultant for a
project in Essex, Md., complained that some of the information in
the inspector general's report was ``misleading'' and ``presented
out of context.''
   ``Mr. Watt did not receive a consulting fee for merely making a
few phone calls,'' said Siegel, adding that the Maryland project
had been ``in the state's pipeline'' two years before she hired
Watt.
   Siegel conceded that Watt ``could drive the federal bureaucracy
when it needed to be driven'' but said his fees ``were not paid
with any federal, state, or local funds.''
   Sen. Richard Shelby called the developer-consultant arrangements
``a situation of bare unadulterated influence-peddling'' for which
the taxpayers ultimately paid.
   The Alabama Democrat also took great pains to ensure that he was
not confused with a consultant of the same name who appeared before
the panel and defended the fees that he received.
   That Richard Shelby, political director of the Republican
Senatorial Committee, earned $442,000 in fees as a consultant to a
renovation project in Dade County, Fla., according to the inspector
general's report.
   Another consultant, Fred Bush, who has been nominated by
President Bush as ambassador to Luxembourg, admitted he ``did not
bring very much'' to the project in Puerto Rico for which he served
as a consultant. The consultant, who was paid $195,000 and still is
due another $65,000, is not related to the president.

<HEAD>One Unexpected By-Product of Soviet Reforms: Surge in Crime</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was a grisly scene that seemed straight from
the violent West, but the location was the Soviet city of Gorky.
   In the heart of the Volga River port, criminals with sawed-off
shotguns murdered two policemen because they wanted their pistols.
   Shocked residents of the metropolis 250 miles east of Moscow now
are afraid to leave home at night or let their children stray from
sight.
   ``In Gorky, people are afraid to go out,'' one newspaper
reported. ``Even downtown, streets become deserted in the
evening,'' another said.
   For most Soviets, violent crime was once what they saw on TV
reports about the United States, or in imported films. But no more.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and loosened controls have not
only made Soviets better informed about crime at home _ they have
sparked a surge in lawlessness itself, by the Kremlin leader's own
admission.
   ``From the very outset, we had to bear in mind that any
extension of democracy and humanization of life should go in
parallel with an uncompromising struggle against criminal
elements,'' Gorbachev told Communist Party leaders last month.
``But party and government bodies, and also work collectives,
permitted a slackening of attention to those issues.''
   In the past week, the Soviet Union's police blotter has included
these spectacular crimes, as reported by state-run media:
   _ A police officer gone bad obtained entry to a bank in Armenia,
and he and his confederates made off with the equivalent of about
$330,000 after a cashier and three policemen died in a hail of
bullets. On learning of the corrupt policeman's crime, his mother
committed suicide.
   _ A criminal gang nicknamed ``The Jackals'' terrorized the
capital of Kazakhstan, Alma Ata. The chief of criminal
investigators in the Central Asian republic says he has never
encountered such gruesome offenses in 30 years of police work. The
Jackals reportedly befriended women, then raped and strangled them.
   _ In the Siberian region of Omsk, two 20-year army deserters go
on a crime spree and battle with police, firing at them with a
submachine gun. The outlaws are captured while asleep in a forest
hideout.
   For Soviets accustomed to hearing that crime was a product of
capitalist exploitation and would disappear under socialism, such
reports _ now possible under Gorbachev's policy of greater openness
_ are perplexing and frightening. Official statistics show the
country's crime problem is getting worse.
   According to Deputy Interior Minister N. Demidov, crime
nationwide was up a staggering 31.2 percent for the first four
months of 1989, compared with the same period last year. Robberies
skyrocketed by 86.7 percent and burglaries increased by more than
two-thirds, Demidov told the newspaper Trud last week.
   More Soviets are now murdered every year by criminals than died
during the entire nine years of Kremlin involvement in the Afghan
war, in which 15,000 soldiers were killed, Trud said.
   In 1986, 20,610 Americans were murdered, according to FBI
statistics.
   Showing high-level concern over the crime boom, the Soviet
Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police affairs, has
created a department to combat lawlessness by fighting its causes,
such as drug abuse, drinking and parasitism, the official Tass news
agency announced Tuesday.
   The same day, a special party commission on legal matters,
headed by former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov, acknowledged ``the
state of public order in the country is deteriorating and the
number of grave crimes is rising,'' and it recommended better
training for police, more specialization for detectives and a
``single nationwide program for combatting crime.''
   Firearms and offense committed with them are still far rarer in
Soviet society than in the United States, but a poll published this
week by the Moscow News weekly indicates the fear of crime is as
widespread among Soviet city dwellers as their U.S. counterparts.
   In Moscow, 33 percent of those polled said they are afraid to
venture out alone at night in the street where they live. That was
more than in three of the four U.S. cities surveyed _ Boston,
Detroit and San Francisco _ and was topped only by New York's 38
percent, according to the survey, conducted in part by the
Institute of Sociology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   One crime surge can be directly traced to Gorbachev's reforms:
extortion. The number of potential prey for racketeers has
burgeoned since the government began promoting the spread of
cooperatives, a move that has put more money into private hands.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported cooperative workers
were ``making guns and bombs right at work'' to protect themselves
from shakedowns, and said their cry had become: ``I'm buying a
gun.''
   In Gorky, a city of 1.5 million where the policemen were slain
in February, authorities settled on officially sponsored
vigilantism as one way to fight a 75 percent increase in serious
crime, creating ``emergency commissions'' headed by local party
chiefs and ``workers' militias.''
   Workers are sent by their factories to work with police for a
year or more, and the enterprises pay their normal salaries and
even buy their police uniforms, the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya
reported.
   Yulian Semenov, a writer of thrillers who often has made CIA
agents his villains, told the Literary Gazette weekly that speed is
essential in fighting lawlessness.
   ``If we go slowly, the streets of Moscow, Leningrad and other
big cities soon will start to resemble New York's, not by the
quantity of cars, goods in the stores or choice of restaurants, but
by the number of criminals, drug addicts and prostitutes,'' the
writer said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Official media were silent when Moslem
guerrillas kept a column of gasoline trucks from reaching Kabul
recently, but the currency traders knew about it and moved the
dollar up against the afghani.
   Word came two days later that the army had reopened the road and
the convoy had safely completed the 260-mile journey from the
Soviet border. The sober-faced men on the bank of the Kabul River
moved the dollar down again.
   Capitalism flourishes in Kabul, which was a crossroads for
merchants and traders many centuries before it became a Marxist
capital 11 years ago.
   The money market, or serai shazad, is conducted in the inner
courtyard of a balconied building with rusting beams, where camel
trains once sojourned overnight.
   Traders in turbans count bundles of notes _ blue, beige, pink _
pausing occasionally to tend their goats or other animals grazing
nearby. It is no secret that the men who dominate the serai shazad
are wealthy, some of them millionaires many times over.
   Civil war, which began with a communist coup in April 1978, has
created periodic and sometimes critical shortages of food, fuel and
medicine.
   For those with money, however, the dun-colored city is a
cornucopia.
   Merchants sell goods from wooden containers at roadsides in
western Kabul. Business is always brisk in rice, flour, wheat,
kerosene and other goods taken from supply convoys that do not make
it through guerrilla-held territory.
   The pocked streets and winding alleys of the old bazaar overflow
with everything from expensive 100-year-old carpets and Mercedes
automobiles to Japanese videocassette recorders, Soviet combat
uniforms and second-hand Western jeans.
   Highways running north to the Soviet border and east to Pakistan
are the city's lifeline and what moves on them sets the rhythm of
the market.
   Helicopter gunships, tanks, rockets and artillery are some of
the tools used to keep them open.
   Then come lulls in guerrilla activity, when convoys rumble into
Kabul without interference. Juma Mohammad, a 38-year-old money
changer, says some rebel commanders have their price.
   ``In's really quite simple,'' he said. ``There is a road.
Somebody controls the road. Somebody else wants to use the road and
deals are made. It's strictly business.''
   Information moves through the money bazaar's grapevine as if it
were an electronic data system, and the afghani rises or falls as
convoys reach Kabul or are attacked.
   Pounds, marks francs and nearly all other currencies are traded,
but the dollar is supreme.
   Dollars, sometimes tens of thousands, are stacked neatly in
chipped cabinets in the traders' tiny offices on the balconies
overlooking the ``trading floor,'' which is dusty or muddy
depending on the weather.
   As Mohammad discusses rates on the telephone, other traders
stand nearby, listening attentively.

   ``We are international businessmen, Mohammad said. ``We buy and
sell everythingg. I have bank accounts in London, Geneva and Paris
and I have traveled the world.''
   Like most of his colleagues, Mohammad is strictly neutral in
talking about the war.
   ``War is terrible, but this is business,'' he said. ``We will
accept any government that will end this war and leave business
alone.''
   Mohammad Sayeed, a colleague, observed: ``If we are left to live
in peace, then the success we have will be nothing special. We will
just be rich.''

   A chair that Columbia University had promised to
keep vacant until Poland allowed historian and Solidarity trade
union adviser Bronislaw Geremek to travel to the United States was
occupied at Wednesday's commencement ceremonies by the scholar.
   ``I think that Poland is changing now in a good diretion,''
Geremek said, speaking in an interview of recent reforms in his
country.
   ``For the first time, in this part of the world, in the
communist system, appeared a hope that the old totalitarian
structure of this regime will disappear without a violent
struggle,'' he said.
   Geremek was one of six people to receive honorary doctorates as
the university awarded degrees to more than 7,300 graduating
students in ceremonies on the lawn in front of the university's Low
Memorial Library.
   Geremek was invited last year, but the Polish government refused
to allow him to leave his country.
   At the 1988 ceremony, university President Michael I. Sovern
promised the chair set up for Geremek would be vacant at every
commencement until he was permitted to attend.
   Geremek, a scholar of medieval European history and an adviser
to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, is also a candidate for
parliament in Poland.
   ``Professor Geremek's absence and now his presence remind us
forcefully of the alternating currents of futility and hope that
run through our time,'' Sovern told the 7,371 graduating students
and their families.
   ``In Poland and the Soviet Union, China and Afghanistan, Central
America, Southern Africa, the Middle East, from year to year and
day to day, the shining rays of optimism seem ready to brighten the
darkness of old realities one moment, to flicker and die the
next,'' he said.
   In addition to Geremek, Columbia awarded honorary doctorates to
stage director Lloyd George Richards, art historian and teacher
Edith Porada, educator Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, violinist Itzhak
Perlman and cell biologist Nicole M. Le Dourain.
   Journalist Anna Quindlen received the university's Medal for
Excellence.

   Many in the poor neighborhood of San
Felipe say they are suffering the wrath of the government for
giving a resounding ``No!'' to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in the
presidential election.
   ``The general and the Defense Forces are really angry with us
down here,'' said a man with two gold teeth enjoying a soft drink
in a small grocery store.
   ``They thought they bought our loyalty with contraband,
providing imported beer cheaply for us to sell, allowing drugs and
prostitition. Then when it came time to vote, everybody voted
against them.''
   The opposition, which says it won the May 7 election, called a
general strike for Wednesday to protest the government's
nullification of the balloting.
   But the strike did not take hold in San Felipe, Chorrillo or
Santa Ana _ three contiguous poor neighborhoods, where many
residents said they felt powerless after their vote was thrown out.
   ``We creamed the government here,'' said a woman in a worn
T-shirt and skirt, smiling broadly. ``Now there are more cops and
`toads' than ever.''
   Paid government informants are known as ``sapos,'' or toads.
   Nilda, who asked to be identified only by her first name,
indicated with her chin two police officers who stood across the
street watching.
   ``If they come in here to bother us after you leave I'm going to
tell them I love Duque more than his own wife and that I was
defending Noriega to the foreign press,'' she said, referring to
Carlos Duque, Noriega's hand-picked presidential candidate.
   ``Otherwise they arrest you and charge you $300 that you don't
have.''
   The strike slowed commercial and industrial activity slightly
elsewhere, but appeared to have been an overall failure.
   ``Businesses like mine buy today to sell today or tomorrow, a
little at a time. We don't have the effect of the big department
stores or wholesalers,'' said the grocery store owner, who wore a
white apron and a blue baseball cap with the Ford Motor Co. logo.
   The owner and four patrons said Noriega should pack up and get
out.
   ``He personally has become the problem,'' said the man drinking
the soft drink, who gave his name as Luis. ``He makes himself out
to be the big nationalist, but the country doesn't mean squat to
him. He only cares about his rackets.''
   In San Miguelito, another working class neighborhood on the
opposite edge of the capital, four women stood on the crest of a
rise in the road banging pots and pans to express their displeasure
with Noriega's continued rule.
   Irsa Herrera stooped to pick up some rocks and sticks and put
them in the road.
   ``We are going to block the streets,'' she declared. ``We want
Noreiga to go as soon as possible.''
   The other women added some spindly branches to the would-be
barricade.
   At the grocer's shop in San Felipe, Nilda said Panamanians could
do little to oust Noriega and would simply have to ``wait until he
makes up his mind to leave.''
   ``We're not fighters,'' Luis said. ``Panamanians are not the
kind of people to take to the streets to confront police and
soldiers.''
   There has been talk of holding new elections for a successor to
Manuel Solis Palma, the figurehead president whose term ends Sept.
1.
   ``But no one will vote if they have new elections,'' said Nilda.
``For what? So we can win again and they can annul it again?''

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In delivery, timing and wordplay-based humor,
but not in tone of voice, Lewis J. Stadlen's portrayal of humorist
S.J. Perelman sounds like Groucho Marx.
   Groucho talking might have been interesting for an evening at
off-Broadway's Cherry Lane Theater but ``S.J. Perelman in Person,''
which opened there Wednesday night, isn't very theatrical, to put
it kindly. Its high points are a slide show of Perelman's friends
during Hollywood screenwriting days and the remembered witticisms
of Dorothy Parker and George S. Kaufman. Its point of least
interest is Perelman helplessly putting together a child's truck on
Christmas Eve.
   The set, by Wes Peters, is a study painted brown. Of course
Perelman makes a pun of being ``in a brown study _ much like this
one.''
   Perelman, who died in 1979 at 75, wrote essays and parodies,
many for The New Yorker. They were collected in some 20 books. The
writer obviously loved to use words unexpectedly.
   ``I was reared and backhanded in Providence,'' Stadlen says. ``I
had to come to New York to be affronted.'' On the telephone, he
says, ``My friend, and I call you that in all insincerity.'' ``You
follow your own star,'' he intones inspiringly. ``I'll follow Hedy
Lamarr.''
   Bob Shanks wrote the one-man play based on Perelman's writings.
Shanks, an Indiana University graduate, has been an ABC programming
vice president and now is managing director of a television network
in Australia. He has written two books about TV and a novel. Ann
Shanks directed.
   Stadlen visually makes Perelman a bespectacled,
nondescript-looking man who brags about flamboyant female
encounters. His body language is good, despite the mustache,
particularly when he portrays a stripper removing a long glove.
   The actor's Broadway debut was as Groucho Marx in the musical
``Minnie's Boys,'' the memory of which probably worked against him
in portraying S.J. Perelman.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of recovering drug addicts and their
supporters marched to the Statehouse demanding drug treatment on
demand and chanting ``We want what Kitty got.''
   The advocates charged Wednesday that, contrary to assertions by
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis during his presidential campaign, drug
programs in Massachusetts reach only a fraction of those in need.
   ``Governor Dukakis, we are here to call you on your promise. We
want treatment now,'' Gregory Davis, a recovering addict who heads
Metro Boston Alive, told the rally on the Statehouse steps. He said
addicts are not interested in clean needles or methadone but do
want treatment.
   Davis reminded his listeners that during the presidential
campaign, Dukakis said no addict in Massachusetts seeking help
would be denied. State officials concede that only about 4,500
addicts are in treatment on a given day, out of an estimated 40,000
addicts statewide.
   But Dukakis administration officials note that public and
private programs combined handle some 20,000 admissions a year.
They say they are seeking funds to achieve the goal of treatment on
demand.
   Public Health Commissioner Deborah Prothrow-Stith drew cheers
when she told the crowd that the number of addicts in treatment has
risen in two years from 7,000 to 15,000.
   ``Everybody deserves treatment when they need it,'' she said.
``We've come a pretty long way.''
   The advocates, however, booed and jeered her superior, Human
Services Secretary Philip Johnston. Johnston, who was representing
Dukakis, who was nearly drowned out by chants, ``Put your money
where your mouth is.''
   After accepting some 2,500 petitions favoring treatment on
demand, Johnston tried to assure the crowd that Dukakis considers
drug treatment a top priority.
   Throughout the rally, advocates chanted ``We want what Kitty
got'' _ referring to the governor's wife, Kitty Dukakis, who has
acknowledged a lifelong chemical dependency.
   She was treated for addiction to amphetamines five years ago and
spent the month of February in a private, residential treatment
program in Rhode Island to address an alcohol problem that flared
up after her husband lost the presidential election.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Wednesday rejected a move to ban arms aid to any group in Cambodia
linked to the Khmer Rouge, which is part of a three-party
resistance coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The amendment to the annual State Department authorization bill
had been proposed by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
panel and was opposed by the Bush administration, which support's
Sihanouk's resistance effort against Vietnamese forces occupying
Cambodia.
   The six nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
also registered strong opposition to such a ban.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., agreed before the bipartisan vote
to hold hearings in his Asian and Pacific Affairs subcommittee on
potential aid to the Cambodian resistance. Cranston said the issue
of Sihanouk's ties to the Khmer Rouge could be resolved in this
week's Sino-Soviet summit in Beijing.
   Beijing has been supporting the Khmer Rouge while Moscow backs
Vietnam, the country that invaded Cambodia in 1978 to end Khmer
Rouge rule and has declared it will end its 10-year occupation in
September.
   If the Khmer Rouge lose their Chinese support as a result of
decisions at the Beijing summit, ``it would be folly for us to
intervene ...'' said Cranston.
   The Khmer Rouge are blamed for more than 1 million deaths during
their 1975-78 rule over Cambodia.
   David Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of state, told the
committee on Wednesday that the administration has not made a
decision yet on whether to seek lethal aid to Sihanouk's forces.
   Asked about a recent statement by Vice President Dan Quayle that
both overt and covert aid were under study, Lambertson assured the
senators no moves would be made without informing members of
Congress.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old boy fidgeted at the
defense table and clutched a stack of baseball cards as he pleaded
guilty to murder and arson in the death of his babysitter.
   Blond, crew-cut Scott James frequently grinned at his attorney
and District Court spectators after changing his plea Wednesday in
the Dec. 31 death of Raymond R. Lauzon.
   Lawyers for both sides said they hope the boy can receive
treatment that will help him turn his life around.
   ``Scott needs a lot of help and it's time he got it,'' defense
attorney Thomas Van Houten said. ``Scott needs some very
significant intervention in his life.''
   The boy, who was 11 when he set the fatal fire, will be released
from custody by his 21st birthday at the latest because he was
tried as a juvenile. Judge Alexander MacNichol tentatively set a
May 30 court date for determining what will be done for Scott.
   Van Houten said the boy likely will need to be sent to another
state for treatment because Maine lacks the services he requires.
   ``The focus will be on treatment, with the understanding that
security will be a factor,'' Van Houten said.
   ``Arson and murder certainly imply a kid who's pretty troubled
and dangerous, but we hope he's salvageable,'' Assistant Attorney
General Eric Wright said.
   Shortly before the murder trial was to begin, the young
defendant told the judge he started the fire.
   But the boy disputed the prosecution's contention that he told
his younger brother he wanted to see what it would be like to burn
the house and kill the man.
   Wright said Scott started the fire after the 53-year-old Lauzon
caught him trying to steal some money from his wallet. Scott and
his brother, Jason, were staying in Lauzon's apartment while their
mother, Janet Sullivan, went to a pub with Lauzon's son, Ronald, on
New Year's Eve.
   The judge ordered the Biddeford boy returned to the Maine Youth
Center in South Portland pending the May 30 hearing.
   During the brief hearing, the judge asked the boy: ``Did you
start the fire?''
   ``Yes, I did,'' the boy answered.
   ``And you knew at the time you started the fire Mr. Lauzon was
upstairs in the house?'' the judge asked.
   ``Yes, I did.''
   ``And you knew you could hurt him?'' MacNichol asked.
   ``Yes, I did.''
   Scott pleaded guilty to felony murder and arson. The prosecutor
agreed to drop two additional murder charges, each based on
different theories of what happened.

   Some conservatives, certain of Ronald Reagan's
place in history, are talking up the idea of finding a place for
him, too, alongside the granite faces of four great presidents at
Mount Rushmore.
   And they think they've gotten a wink from the man himself.
   At least Reagan smiled when an artist's sketch was presented
last summer showing him alongside the Rushmore visages, says R.
Emmett Tyrrell Jr., a promoter of the movement to add Reagan.
   ``He seemed pleased,'' said Tyrrell, editor-in-chief of American
Spectator magazine, a monthly conservative review.
   Tyrrell sounds half serious _ and half unserious _ about the
idea. But people are taking him entirely seriously, he said.
   Tom Griffith, executive secretary of the Mount Rushmore Society,
is seriously trying to spike the idea.
   ``It won't happen,'' he said.
   The society raised the funds for the original project 60 years
ago. The faces of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore
Roosevelt, drilled and dynamited into a mountainside of the Black
Hills in South Dakota, are the largest carved figures anywhere;
Washington's is as high as a five-story building, bigger than any
sphinx in Egypt.
   ``The simple fact is there is no more suitable rock to carve
anyone at Mount Rushmore,'' Griffith said in an interview from
Rapid City, S.D.
   ``Why fool with a masterpiece?'' he asked. ``Would you paint
another figure next to the Mona Lisa?''
   Retorts Tyrrell: ``Small-minded people, typical small-minded
people.''
   Tyrrell said he is creating a Committee for Monumental Progress
to promote the idea. He said he has just written to Reagan ``asking
him to please consider allowing us to get a proper mold of his nose
and at least one ear.''
   If Tyrrell is only semi-serious, the Young Americans for Freedom
are three-quarters there.
   To test sentiment, they put a ballot into a fund-raising letter
sent to 23,000 ``average American citizens'' and will promote the
idea if the response is enthusiastic, says Tom Lizardo, executive
director of group.
   ``The heat of the response, not just numbers, is the key
thing,'' said Lizardo. Ballots will be opened in June, he said.
   Donald Devine, a former Reagan officeholder, said he has signed
a Reagan-to-Rushmore petition, although he thinks it may be early
for so bold a move. ``Ten or 20 years from now might be better,''
he said.
   ``The whole country burns with interest,'' said Tyrrell. ``We've
had threats _ `Touch that mountain and we'll bomb you,''' he said.
``And other people with tears in their eyes _ `Oh, Mr. Tyrrell,
thank God someone's thought of it.'''
   Griffith said additional faces have been proposed over the years
_ Franklin Roosevelt and Susan Anthony have had a number of
champions.
   But Tyrrell said Reagan is the most logical choice because ``he
brought peace and prosperity to a country riven by fear.''
   Tyrrell said if there's no room for a carved Reagan, a place
could be found for ``a cement nose, a cement ear, a cement chin''
of the former president.
   As for the cost: ``We want the whole bill to be footed by the
people of South Dakota. It's going to be their tourist trap and
they ought to pay for it.''

   Walter Jankowski probably won't be walking
tall again for a while after making only 60 miles of his planned
180-mile trek across Wisconsin on stilts.
   Jankowski, 27, started the walk in efforts to win a $10,000
radio contest, but WKLH radio marketing director Brad Wallace said
Jankowski got too tired and too bruised from the 4-foot stilts to
make it from Prairie du Chien to Milwaukee in three days.
   Jankowski's entry was chosen from thousands telling what they
would do for $10,000. Others promised to windsurf across Lake
Michigan, herd sheep during rush hour or pluck mustache hairs.
   Jankowski left Prairie du Chien on Tuesday but stopped after
reaching Cobb.
   Jankowski, a structural engineer, said he has stilt-walked for
six or seven years, but didn't do any special training for his

   Mitterrand scheduled an overnight visit Saturday with President

the trip.
   Businesses in the oceanside resort are just as unmoved. Biagioni

   The contents of a 124-year-old time

   The time capsule was to be opened Saturday at the climax of a

   ``We can't get it out. The wall would come tumbling down if we

   That may be a long wait. The church is on the National Register

   Members laid the cornerstone and buried the box on April 15,
1865, the day after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.
   No one considered digging it out until this year.
   ``We're just curious to find out what's in it,'' Kallio said.

<HEAD>Senators Move to Ban Use of Chemical Alar on Apples and Other Foods</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX7</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four senators want Congress to ban the use of
the Alar on apples, even though apple growers say they intend to
halt application of the controversial chemical because of fears by
consumers.
   ``If we do not ban Alar from the market, American consumers, in
increasing numbers, will ban apples from their diet,'' Sen. Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn., told a news conference Wednesday where the bill
was unveiled.
   The bill would ban the use of the chemical manufactured by
Uniroyal on foods, effective as soon as the president affixed his
signature. Besides apples, Alar also is commonly used on grapes,
cherries and peanuts.
   The chemical, which enhances the appearance of apples and keeps
them from spoiling for longer periods, has been shown to cause
cancer in lab animals. It still could be used on commercially grown
flowers under the bill.
   The Food and Drug Administration estimated on March 16 that Alar
was used on 10 percent of the nation's apple supply.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., indicated he would not wait for the
measure to go through committee but instead would attempt to attach
it to another bill that is nearing floor action. ``The train is
under way,'' he declared.
   Other sponsors are Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   There were initial denials from the Environmental Protection
Agency that Alar constitutes a health risk for consumers, but apple
sales have plunged in recent months amid concern about the chemical.
   Apples producers are facing a $100 million loss ``on the raw
crop'' this year as a result of unfavorable reports concerning Alar
and there has been an additional 30 percent drop in apple juice
sales, according to Derl I. Derr, president of the International
Apple Institute, based in McLean, Va.
   Derr said his group, composed of 23 state organizations
representing an estimated 90 percent of the nation's 15,000
commercial growers, favors taking Alar off the market but not by
legislative means. He said reducing the allowable amount to zero
would require an EPA finding that Alar poses an ``imminent hazard.''
   ``And if you think we have a bad market now, you should see what
it would be like then,'' Derr said. He said his group is urging
growers to stop using the compound and is hoping Uniroyal will
voluntarily halt sales.
   Earlier this week, Derr said apple growers are already planning
to eliminate Alar. ``By September of this year, the already low
levels of Alar will be reduced to virtually zero. Simply, the U.S.
apple industry is not going to use Alar.''
   None of the four senators is a member of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, which for years has balked at tough farm chemical
regulation recommended by environmentalists and consumer advocates.
   A similar bill was quietly introduced in the House earlier this
year, although no action has been taken on it.

<HEAD>Government Says It Won't Meet September Target For Opening Waste
Dump</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Energy Department has run into a new delay
in opening the nation's first permanent dump for radioactive waste
from its nuclear weapons complex.
   Previous delays in the $800 million Waste Isolation Pilot
Project had threatened to interrupt the department's nuclear
weapons production, but Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told
Congress on Wednesday he foresaw no major new problems.
   Watkins said the waste repository, near Carlsbad, N.M., would
not open as scheduled in September, and it might not be ready
before next February. He held out the possibility that some waste
could be entered at the site before the end of this year but said
that wouldn't be determined until November.
   Watkins told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the
Environmental Protection Agency had fallen far behind schedule in
providing a legally required verification that toxic wastes at the
repository would not migrate off the site.
   ``We physically cannot get through this process until
November,'' Watkins said, adding that under normal procedures it
would take until next February before the EPA could hold public
hearings on the waste migration issue.
   He gave no specific new target date for opening the facility.
   The underground cavern would be the nation's first permanent
dump for plutonium-contaminated wastes generated by the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons production complex.
   Opening of the dump is considered an urgent priority for the
department, as well as for the state governments of Idaho and
Colorado. The governors of those states recently said they will not
permit an indefinite buildup of hazardous wastes produced by Energy
Department weapons plants near Idaho Falls and Denver.
   The repository originally was scheduled to open in 1988. One
reason for the delay was that Congress adjourned without
transferring control of the federally owned site from the Interior
Department to the Energy Department.
   The land-transfer legislation was blocked by some members of the
New Mexico congressional delegation who have raised questions about
safety.
   The dump is expected eventually to hold about 900,000 drums of
plutonium-contaminated waste, about one-fifth of the radioactive
debris generated by the weapons complex in the last four decades.
   Watkins also told the Senate panel he would produce by July a
firm schedule for restarting the first of three nuclear reactors in
South Carolina that are the nation's only source of tritium, a
perishable gas needed to make nuclear warheads. All three reactors
were shut down last spring for safety reasons.
   Watkins had disclosed last month that the target date for
restarting the K reactor at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken,
S.C., had been pushed back from late 1989 to early 1990.
   The energy secretary also urged the committee to support a Bush
administration proposal for building new reactor complexes _ one in
South Carolina, the other in Idaho _ to replace the aging Savannah
River reactors in the mid-1990s. The cost of building both reactors
has been put at $6.8 billion.
   Watkins acknowledged that one reactor would produce enough
tritium to meet the government's weapons requirements, but he said
``duality'' was needed to ensure that a forced shutdown of one
reactor would not endanger the nation's weapons supply.
   ``I believe the most compelling example of this problem is that
new production of tritium or plutonium is essentially impossible
within this country as long as the three Savannah River production
reactors remain out of service,'' Watkins said, adding that the
Soviet Union currently operates 11 such reactors.
   Critics contend one reactor would be enough, particularly in
light of the federal budget deficit problem and prospects for
further U.S.-Soviet disarmament.
   ``We just don't have the money to do these things,'' said Sen.
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.

   The ethics investigation of House Speaker Jim
Wright has attracted little interest among the public, despite its
dominance of newspaper front pages, says a Gallup Poll.
   Instead, people are more interested in the Alaska oil spill.
Sixty percent of those polled in a ``Newstrack'' survey released
Wednesday said they did not even know who Wright was, and only 15
percent of respondents said they were following the ethics
investigation of the Texas Democrat ``very closely.''
   The poll was conducted for the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror
media company.
   The only news story among seven selections that attracted more
apathy than Wright's tribulations was the resignation of Japanese
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in the wake of financial scandal.
   Only 12 percent of those polled could even identify Takeshita as
Japan's former leader, and just 6 percent of respondents said they
were following developments ``very closely.''
   But the Exxon Valdez's spill of 11 million gallons of oil into
Alaska's Prince William Sound has piqued the interest of the
public, the survey said. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they
were following oil spill developments ``very closely'' while 37
percent said they were watching ``fairly closely.''
   In fact, 36 percent of respondents said the Exxon Valdez
incident was the news story they were following most closely.
   On the other hand, 30 percent of respondents said they were
following the Wright probe ``not at all closely,'' and 43 percent
said the same of the Takeshita resignation.
   The seven news stories about which respondents were polled
included the Wright probe, the oil spill, the Takeshita
resignation, the alleged rape and beating by a youth gang of a
jogger in New York's Central Park, the Oliver North trial, the
Supreme Court's hearing on arguments in a Missouri abortion case,
and the explosion and fire that killed 47 sailors on the USS Iowa.
   The telephone survey of 1,239 adults was conducted from May 4-7
and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   The survey conducted by the Gallup Organization is the first of
a regular series to be done for the Times Mirror Center for Press
and Public Policy here.

   Here are highlights of the fiscal 1990 federal
budget:
   Overall spending _ $1.165 trillion.
   Overall revenues _ $1.065 trillion.
   Deficit _ $99.7 billion.
   Deficit reduction _ Counts $28 billion in savings, roughly
evenly divided between spending restraint and new receipts.
   Taxes _ $5.3 billion in additional collections, specific taxes
to be determined later. Also, $500 million is expected from
stricter enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service.
   Other revenues _ $2.7 billion in higher user fees and $5.7
billion in asset sales, details still to be decided.
   Entitlements _ $8.3 billion in claimed savings from programs
that automatically pay benefits to qualified recipients. Of this,
$2.3 billion would come from Medicare, probably by restraining
payments to doctors and hospitals. In addition, $1.9 billion would
come from agriculture, $1.8 billion by moving the Postal Service
off-budget, $1.1 billion from federal pension and other programs,
$496 million from sales of veterans housing loans and $477 million
by taking credit from unused food stamps.
   Defense _ $299.2 billion, compared to $296.7 billion this year.
   Science and Space _ $14.1 billion, up from $12.7 billion this
year.
   Environment _ $17.4 billion, up from $16.8 billion.

   Portugal's best-known revolutionary,
Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, was greeted by cheering neighbors and
friends when he returned home today after spending five years in
prison.
   It was Saraiva de Carvalho who masterminded the 1974 revolution
that toppled almost 50 years right-wing dictatorship in Portugal.
   The Supreme Court of Justice ordered him free Wednesday after
throwing out his May 1987 conviction on charges of leading a
terrorist group in the early 1980s that pledged to seek ``a halt to
the unbridled advance of capitalism.''
   The court had accepted Saraiva de Carvalho's appeal that
authorities violated the constitution by making him await trial for
longer than the three-year maximum stipulated by law.
   The one-time chief of Portugal's revolutionary security police
had been serving a 15-year sentence.
   Saraiva de Carvalho _ known throughout Portugal simply as Otelo
_ was arrested in 1984 on charges of leading the left-wing group
Popular Forces of April 25, which was blamed for terrorist attacks
and at least 15 killings.
   Hundreds of supporters shouted ``Long live April 25!'' as
Saraiva de Carvalho emerged Wednesday from the prison in Tomar,
about 90 miles north of Lisbon. That was the date of the 1974
overthrow.
   More than 100 well-wihers set off firecrackers and cheered when
he arrived by car early today at his family's modest apartment in
this Lisbon suburb.
   Before entering the house to greet his wife and daughter, he
embraced two former revolutionary captains, Vitor Alves and Mario
Tome.
   Saraiva de Carvalho regularly wore his lieutenant colonel's army
uniform while in prison and consistently protested his innocence,
saying, ``Mine was without doubt a political trial.''
   Twice a presidential candidate, he was jailed in 1975 for an
alleged role in a failed left-wing countercoup but later released.
   RTP state television reported that 28 members of the Popular
Forces jailed with him also received notice of release.
   An additional 17 prisoners, in jail for less than three years,
will not be released, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.

<HEAD>Mitochondria Genes Blamed for Rare Eye Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare form of blindness has been traced to an
error in genes of the body's tiny power plants known as
mitochondria, according to a report published today.
   Mitochondria reside by the thousands inside cells, where they
produce the energy that the body needs to stay alive. Far in the
evolutionary past, these structures were independent creatures, and
they still have genes that are separate from the rest of the body's
blue prints.
   In a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Douglas
C. Wallace and colleagues from Emory University present evidence
that a single pinpoint error in these genes is the cause of a form
of inherited eye disease called Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.
   The team said they found the same error in two families with the
disease, one American black and the other European white. They
theorize that the genetic error occured independently in the two
families.
   Mitochondria and their genes are passed from generation to
generation only by mothers. The father's contribution is lost
during the early moment's of an embryo's development. Mitochondrial
genes produce 13 proteins that are essential for life.
   In a separate report in the journal, researchers from
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York present evidence
that rare muscle disorders can result from deletions of parts of
the mitochondrial genes.
   The research ``consolidates the growing evidence that defects of
this small part of the human genome cause disease,'' Dr. A.E.
Harding of the Institute of Neurology in London wrote in an
accompanying editorial.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, wrapping up a historic
visit, called Wednesday for demilitarizing the Chinese-Soviet
border and said unrest in China is part of a necessary process of
evolution for the communist nation.
   On the last full day of his trip, the Soviet president said he
hoped the mass protests that have disrupted the Beijing summit
would end in a negotiated settlement.
   ``A difficult, painful but political dialogue is going on
between the leadership, the youth and the public concerning these
events, and it seems to me that we should welcome that fact,'' he
said.
   As the Soviet leader spoke, more than 1 million Chinese poured
into the streets to demonstrate for democratic reforms in China.
The protests spread to at least 20 provincial capitals, including
Shanghai, where at least 70 students were on a hunger strike.
   Gorbachev on Thursday traveled to Shanghai, where he was
welcomed by the city's Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, and
Mayor Zhu Rongji. He was to conclude his four-day trip with a tour
of a special economic zone, one of the showcases of economic reform
that the Soviet Union is trying to emulate.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Gorbachev defended socialist
countries experiencing unrest as they attempt to make reforms.
   ``If anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history,
I think they will be disappointed again,'' he said.
   Earlier, in a nationally televised interview, Gorbachev said the
summit that normalized relations between the nations went well
``despite all the tensions'' from the huge demonstrations that have
altered his itinerary.
   He said he felt welcome in the city, where no Soviet leader had
set foot for three decades.
   In a speech to Chinese academics in the Great Hall of the
People, Gorbachev urged that the 4,300-mile frontier where 1.6
million troops now face each other be turned into a ``border of
peace and good neighborliness.''
   He said an earlier pledge to withdraw 200,000 troops from Asia
would be fulfilled by the end of next year and would include the
pullout of 12 divisions, or 120,000 soldiers, from the border.
   The Soviet Union is believed to have about 600,000 troops along
the border. The Chinese, armed with less modern equipment, have
more than 1 million troops stationed there.
   Gorbachev said 11 air force regiments would be disbanded and 16
warships would be removed from the Pacific Fleet.
   Gorbachev also said:
   _ Soviet and Chinese negotiating positions on Cambodia are
``very, very close'' to each other but that the two sides failed to
agree on a satisfactory settlement of the struggle, in which
Soviet-backed Vietnamese occupation forces are battling
Chinese-backed Cambodian guerrillas.
   He said there is now ``light at the end of the tunnel.''
   _ The United States should withdraw its forces from South Korea
in a bid to resolve that regional touble spot.
   _ Chinese-Soviet trade, which the two sides hope will increase
with normalization, ``presents a poor picture'' at present, but new
ventures between the two countries and completion of a new rail
line linking Beijing and Moscow should improve trade.
   _ All Asian and Pacific countries, with U.N. help, should set up
a mechanism for resolving regional disputes that still threaten
peace in the region, most notably now in Cambodia and Afghanistan.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union is ``prepared to work for the
withdrawal, on terms to be agreed with China, of military units and
armaments from the border areas, leaving only the personnel
required for performing routine border guard duties.''
   ``Demilitarizing the Soviet-Chinese border and turning it into a
border of peace and good-neighborliness is a noble goal which we
could attain through joint efforts,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, in a meeting with Premier Li Peng, Gorbachev said,
``We want the Soviet-Chinese border to be protected only by
friendship.'' He also called for regular consultations between the
militaries of the two countries.
   The two sides fought a brief border war over the disputed
frontier in 1969, and sporadic clashes have continued over the
years. But tensions have slowly eased during the 1980s.
   On Monday, the day Gorbachev arrived in Beijing, Moscow began
pulling troops out of Mongolia, the Soviet ally along China's
northern border. The Kremlin has said it will withdraw 50,000
troops, three-fourths of the Soviet force in Mongolia, by the end
of 1990.
   Chinese leaders have generally welcomed the Soviet troop
reduction, while claiming that it has not yet gone far enough.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, head of the Chinese military, also
has reduced the People's Liberation Army from more than 4 million
in 1985 to about 3 million today. Most of those troops are
stationed along the Soviet border and China's volatile border with
Vietnam.
   China and other Asian nations have been cool to Gorbachev's
concept of collective security in Asia, expressing fear it is a
Soviet attempt to increase its strategic influence in the area.
   Gorbachev, however, said collective efforts were ``of cardinal
importance both for Asia and for the entire world.''
   He also spoke of his talks with Deng and other Chinese leaders,
saying they were an ``important milestone'' and that ``a long
period of mutual alienation is now behind us.''
   On Tuesday the two sides announced the normalization of
government and party relations, ending a 30-year rift caused by
ideological and strategic differences.

<HEAD>Report: More Signs of US-Honduran Deal on Contra Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New doubts have been cast on Bush administration
claims that there was no deal between the Reagan administration and
Honduras on aid to the Nicaragua Contras, according to a report
published today.
   The New York Times says classified documents describe similar
dealings at the time with Guatemala and Costa Rica.
   The Times cites a classified December 1985 memo written by
Oliver North to his boss at the National Security Council, John M.
Poindexter. Poindexter was about to visit Honduras and meet with
Gen. Walter Lopez, head of the Honduran military.
   The memo, which earlier was released in heavily edited form by
the congressional committees which investigated the Iran-Contra
affair, referred to a decision by the Honduran military to cut off
the delivery of weapons to the rebels, The Times said.
   North wrote: ``From previous meetings with Lopez, it is obvious
that the Hondurans perceive the U.S.G. (United States government)
is `using' Honduras for its own political ends. They have learned
that we withhold our assistance ... in order to force concessions
from them. They are now using this same tactic with us as a means
of insuring that the U.S.G will `come through' for them.
   ``Lopez and his colonels recognize that the only leverage they
have over us is their covert support for the Nicaraguan
resistance,'' the memo said.
   Another document cited by The Times was written by Alan Fiers,
chief of the CIA's Central America Task Force. It was directed to
then-CIA Director William J. Casey and dated Oct. 23, 1986, shortly
before Congress voted to allow the agency to resume assistance to
the Contras.
   Fiers reported on a trip to Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica
to discuss logistical help for the Contra aid effort.
   ``The Hondurans ... agreed to fully support the program and to
allow supplies to begin moving as scheduled,'' Fiers wrote. ``They
were very clear as to what they seek in return: support for the
purchase of advanced aircraft, with those aircraft arriving as soon
as possible (within six months).''
   Fiers added: ``We must be as responsive as we need to insure
this cooperation, yet at the same time remain within the bounds of
propriety.''
   The Times said Fiers also wrote that in Guatemala, the CIA would
be paying for ``the Guatemalan program of internal support to
Nicaraguan political parties and working with them in structuring
this program.''
   ``In return for President (Vinicio) Cerezo's support, we will be
assisting him in establishing a public relations-media operation
designed to strengthen his image and democracy in Guatemala,'' the
memo said.
   Fiers wrote that officials in Costa Rica had deep concerns about
the Contra program but had agreed to support it ``politically and
diplomatically by taking the lead in criticizing Nicaragua and
insisting on a democratic form of government.''
   The memo added that the officials ``spent considerable time
discussing their financial problems, and asked for U.S.G. help in
negotiating a rescheduling agreement with U.S. banks.''

<TEXT>
   A Senate panel has moved the energy industry
one step closer to a long-sought prize it says will benefit
consumers as well as commerce.
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources, by a 17-2 vote,
approved legislation Wednesday to lift remaining price controls on
natural gas by 1993,
   Experts generally agree that natural gas prices would be
unlikely to rise immediately in reaction to ending price controls,
since the market price currently is well below the controlled
price. Many industry officials predict, however, that growing
demand for gas in the 1990s would likely push prices substantially
higher.
   The full Senate may consider the bill, which is strongly
supported by the Bush administration, as early as next week. The
House passed a nearly identical bill last month with virtually no
dissent.

interest in a joint venture with a European company.
   Bush made his decision after an investigation by an inter-agency
committee headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, the
administration announced Wednesday.
   The latest review involved a joint venture between Westinghouse
and ASEA Brown Boveri LTD (ABB), a manufacturing firm based in
Switzerland. The joint venture, known as Westinghouse-ABB Power T&amp;D
Co., was created earlier in the year to manufacture and sell
high-voltage electrical transmission equipment.
   The president has the power to block foreign acquisitions of
American companies if the sales would endanger national security.

   A consumers group is starting a national
campaign to investigate alleged abuses of child-labor laws and to
pressure governments to improve enforcement of the standards.
   The National Consumers League also said Wednesday it would seek
to determine the impact of increased employment among teen-agers on
education and family and personal relationships.
   Ms. Golodner said the federal Labor Department's Wage and Hour
Division is woefully understaffed, with just 985 compliance
officers whose duties including monitoring labor laws.
   ``From the sweatshops in New York to the fast food restaurants
in California, more and more young people are working _ and often
illegally,'' said Linda Golodner, the league's executive director.

   All 19 members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee want President Bush to ask Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to clarify the Soviet commitment to the treaty banning
medium-range nuclear-armed missiles.
   The senators said they were disturbed by a recent remarks by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that the Soviets might
not dismantle their SS-23 medium-range missiles as required by the
treaty if NATO nations modernize their short-range nuclear weapons.
   It is in ``neither side's interest at this time to challenge
that agreement,'' the senators said in a letter made public
Wednesday. ``Both sides should instead be building on the
achievements of the INF accord and moving forward to take advantage
of the many promising opportunities before us in East-West
relations.''

   A leader of a campaign against restrictions
on facsimile transmissions couldn't get his fax straight. He
inadvertently caused an electronic mail deluge that irked one
governor into outlawing the messages.
   ``Who would have anticipated that this many responses would have
been generated?'' Elliott Segal of the National Fax Users Committee
wondered Wednesday, after last week's fax flood on the phone lines
of Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill.
   Fax machines, which can send a page of text or illustration over
telephone lines in about a minute, are used for everything from
sending documents between lawyers to getting in a speedy order to
the sandwich shop.
   Before Lucille Ball's death last month, the machine at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center churned out get-well messages virtually
nonstop, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.
   ``I am completely convinced the fax machine is destined to
become the Hallmark card of the '90s,'' Wise said.
   But a campaign to make them a lobbying tool so irked O'Neill
that on Tuesday the governor signed into a law a measure allowing
people receiving unsolicited fax messages to seek up to $200 in
damages.
   O'Neill said the lobbyists overwhelmed his office fax machine on
Friday as he awaited details on flood conditions from the state
Office of Emergency Management.
   ``Frankly, last week was the first time the need for this kind
of legislation was brought home to me,'' the governor said.
   Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer may sign a similar law
with a fine of up to $1,000 after receiving 343 fax messages last
week.
   At least nine other states are considering fax caps.
   The deluge to the governors was ``a very unfortunate
situation,'' said Segal, who described himself in a telephone
interview as ``kind of a point man, I guess'' for the fax users'
committee.
   The committee is a loose-knit group of users without a
headquarters or president, said Segal.
   ``It's becoming evident though that it needs to become more
structured,'' he said. ``I never would have anticipated this type
of coverage for that.''
   Segal is vice president of marketing for Mr. Fax, an
Irvine-based firm that sells facsimile paper to about 30,000
customers, including 5,000 in California. They advertise, he said,
by sending facsimile transmissions to 500,000 fax users nationwide.
   Segal said 3,000 ``fax fliers'' were sent to Maryland businesses
for relay to the governor. Hundreds complied, but the lobbying
effort rattled nerves instead of opinions.
   ``If we had any important messages coming in we wouldn't have
been able to get them through,'' said David S. Iannucci, the
governor's lobbyist.
   Iannucci called the one-day campaign ``incredibly
counterproductive,'' saying it might help persuade Schaefer to sign
the bill.
   Bills to regulate facsimile transmissions also are being
considered by legislatures in California, Rhode Island, New York,
Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, New Jersey, Louisiana and Washington.
   The furor over faxing has grown as advertisers take advantage of
the machines' rising popularity. Besides tying up the receiving
machine, uninvited advertising uses up its expensive special paper.
   Donna Murdoch, executive director of the American Facsimile
Association in Philadelphia, said the group doesn't think
advertising by fax works anyway _ ``unless you're selling fax
paper.'' Her group estimates there are 3 million fax machines in
this country.
   Segal's group isn't alone in getting state officials' attention.
   New York state consumer protection chief Richard Kessel said he
was about to send an important memo to Gov. Mario Cuomo when his
machine spit out a three-page menu from a sandwich shop. Now New
York legislators are considering banning junk fax.
   Ohio state Rep. Otto Beatty last month introduced a bill to ban
fax ads. He said he was irritated when an ad for men's clothing
appeared on his law office machine, interrupting an exchange of
documents during a business negotiation.
   Washington state Rep. Ken Jacobsen, who introduced a bill
against junk fax, said of the issue: ``This is the ultimate in
abusive use of a private communication system. You get a message
you didn't want from people you don't know on paper they didn't
buy.''

<HEAD>Student Protests Revive After Decade of Quiet</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: One name is cq for Sukarno, Suharto and Rudini</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Student demonstrations are stirring
again after 10 years of relative quiet on Indonesian campuses.
   The protests so far have been mild, as students from several
colleges test the limits of tolerance. But they have been taken
seriously by officials in a country with a history of student
militancy.
   In 1966, students were a powerful force in agitating for the
removal of the late President Sukarno in favor of his eventual
successor, Gen. Suharto.
   And it was a group of students whil in 1945 kidnapped Sukarno
and persuaded him to declare independence from the Dutch.
   Students were a constant headache for the authorities in the
1970s, helping spark the so-called Malari riots in January 1974
during a visit by then Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.
   A student demonstration was joined by thousands of poor
Jakartans, who took to the streets in a mass protest against the
unequal distribution of wealth.
   When order was restored, 13 people had died, 770 were arrested,
including many students, and property damage was extensive.
   The rioting was officially blamed on two banned political
parties allegedly trying to overthrow the government. Security was
tightened, 11 newspapers were closed and a couple of senior
generals lost their jobs.
   The government was disturbed by the uprising, however, and
Suharto ordered the rich to stop flaunting their wealth.
   Student dissent flared again when Suharto was re-elected
unopposed for a third term in March 1978 and activists who accused
Suharto and his family of corruption were briefly jailed.
   By then the authorities had had enough.
   Student political activity was banned and student councils
abolished in their previous form as pressure groups for political
action.
   Students had to sign statements when they enrolled promising not
to take part in political activity or criticize the government
while on campus.
   Scores of expulsions enforced the disciplinary mood and activist
professors also were ousted.
   The regulations remain in effect and student demonstrations
still are banned, but controls have been eased in recent months,
clearly with official sanction, diplomatic observers say.
   Students have taken to the streets to protest against the 1978
ban on political activity on campus. They have also voiced
opposition to a 25 percent increase in electricity charges and the
limited compensation for families forced from land in Central Java
by construction of a World Bank-financed dam.
   Demonstrations by as many as 2,000 students at a time have been
generally peaceful. Last month, troops reportedly entered the
campus of the Islamic University in Bandung, 110 miles southeast of
Jakarta, and student leaders said 50 of their colleagues were
injured. The army denied any violence.
   Students at the Jakarta Teachers' Training College reacted with
a demonstration in which they burned a papier-mache replica of a
military boot.
   The reaction of top officials has been ambivalent.
   President Suharto said university rectors should be held
responsible for the behavior of their students. Several rectors
rejected this, saying they were not responsible for the off-campus
activities of their students.
   ``Demonstrations or protest rallies are clearly unacceptable,''
said armed forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Nurhadi Purwosaputro. But
the armed forces commander-in-chief, Gen. Try Sutrisno, was quoted
as saying demonstrations were allowed providing they were not
disorderly.
   Education and Culture Minister Fuad Hassan, himself a student
activist in the mid-1960s, said students had the ``right to express
public concern as long as they do not launch demonstrations on
behalf of their universities.'
   Home Affairs Minister Rudini said he was ``not concerned yet
with the recent student ... protests because they are still
tolerable and not disturbing national stability.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished at its highest level
against the Japanese yen since the October 1987 stock market crash,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 66.00-point
gainer the previous day, dropped 136.12 points, or 0.40 percent, to
finish trading at 33,856.33.
   The dollar closed at 138.88 yen, up 1.18 yen from Wednesday's
137.70-yen finish. Opening higher at 139.45 yen, the currency moved
between 138.60 yen and 139.48 yen.
   Traders said Japanese investors sold the yen and West German
marks in favor of the dollar as soon as trading began, following a
similar overnight trend in overseas markets.
   The dollar was bolstered by a U.S. government report Wednesday
showing the nation's trade deficit fell to $8.86 billion in March
from a revised $9.82 billion in February, traders said.
   The Bank of Japan intervened several times, taking the dollar
off its opening highs.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei's decline was mainly due to
the yen's decline and the marked improvement in the U.S. trade
deficit, Nomura Securities' Yoshiro Inouye said.

<TEXT>
   Jim Beam Brands Co. was cleared of negligence in
a lawsuit by a woman who said her son suffered birth defects
because she drank its whiskey during pregnancy.
   Harold and Candance Thorp of Seattle were seeking about $4
million in damages for lifetime assistance for their 4-year-old son
Michael, who is retarded and deformed.
   Mrs. Thorp, 39, testified she was an alcoholic who drank up to a
fifth of Jim Beam a day during her pregnancy. But she and her
husband insisted she would have stopped drinking had the bottles
carried a warning label for pregnant women.
   ``We're obviously disappointed with the verdict, but the jury
system operates,'' said their lawyer, Barry Epstein.
   Epstein said the U.S. District Court jury's verdict was not a
total loss. He said he didn't think Wednesday's decision would set
a precedent for similar cases.
   ``We feel that this litigation has created an awareness in the
public that, if it saves one child, it will all be worth it,'' he
said. ``We hope as a result of this case ... that (news of) the
dangers of alcohol will be spread far and wide.''
   He said no decision had been made on an appeal.
   Shannon Stafford, Jim Beam's chief lawyer, said he was
``obviously pleased'' but declined further comment.
   During the trial, Epstein had argued that Beam had an obligation
to warn the public about the health risks of alcohol consumption by
pregnant women.
   But witnesses for Beam said Mrs. Thorp had been warned
repeatedly by relatives and friends about the dangers of drinking
alcohol while pregnant and that she and other alcoholics would not
have heeded a warning label.
   Beam also contended that the boy's problems were caused by
heredity and neglect, not by his mother's alcohol abuse.
   The decision ``seemed so obvious,'' said Staci Gilbreth, a
22-year-old juror who had a baby in December. ``I was surprised
they were suing Jim Beam.''
   ``They could have sued everyone,'' said Geraldine Jackson, 32,
another juror, who referred to testimony that Mrs. Thorp had been
seen drinking beer in bars several times during her pregnancy.
   Jurors said they decided the danger of alcohol to developing
fetuses was common knowledge at the time of Mrs. Thorp's pregnancy
and said that was a factor in their decision to deny damages.
   About 1 percent of the infants born in the United States each
year, or 35,000 babies, are born with fetal alcohol syndrome. The
syndrome was identified in the United States by physicians at the
University of Washington in Seattle in 1973, although a French
doctor had pinpointed it several years earlier in France.
   Symptoms include slow growth, central nervous system impairment,
hyperactivity, mental retardation and distorted facial
characteristics.
   Starting in November, a new federal law will require all
alcoholic beverage containers to carry warnings about birth defects
and other health hazards related to drinking.

   Anne Henderson-Pollard, convicted of
helping her husband pass intelligence secrets to Israel, has been
returned to the federal prison here.
   Henderson-Pollard, who is serving a five-year sentence for being
an accessory, was transferred Tuesday from the Federal Medical
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., prison officials said.
   She had been taken to Minnesota after she collapsed in January.
   Her father, Bernard R. Henderson, said she was returned to
Danbury after agreeing to eat as much as possible because her
weight has fallen below 90 pounds.
   Henderson-Pollard, who has complained of painful digestive
system disorders and other ailments, was examined by doctors at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, and a medical regimen was prescribed.
   Prison officials blamed her failure to adhere to the regimen for
her collapse in January.
   Her husband, former intelligence analyst Jonathan J. Pollard, is
serving a life sentence for giving Israel secret documents.

<TEXT>
   Local elections may yield clues
to whether moderates have gained ground in the wake of a string of
bungled Irish Republican Army attacks.
   Counting of the votes in Wednesday's balloting began this
morning, but the province's complex system of proportional
representation meant first results were not expected for several
hours, and the final tally was due late Friday.
   Some 900 candidates are seeking the 566 seats on 26 district
councils in the British province where Protestants outnumber Roman
Catholics 3-to-2. Seventeen of the councils are controlled by the
two predominantly Protestant Unionist parties and the rest by
predominantly Catholic nationalist parties.
   Analysts say further gains by the nonviolent Social Democratic
and Labor Party, a moderate Catholic organization, at the cost of
Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of the outlawed IRA, may be due
to the IRA's bomb and bullet campaign to end British rule.
   IRA attacks have lately been claiming a number of so-called
innocent victims _ civilians not involved with the security forces.
   In the latest embarrassment to Sinn Fein, an IRA bomb attached
to a Belfast telegraph pole left a 3-year-old Catholic girl in
hospital with shrapnel in her foot.
   As voters went to the polls Wednesday, the headline in The Irish
News, the province's leading Catholic newspaper, said: ``BLOOD FROM
A BABY SIGNALS PROVO HORROR.'' Provo is a nickname for the IRA.
   The Social Democratic and Labor Party has posted some gains
since the November 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that gave the Irish
government a consultative role in the governing of Northern
Ireland. London and Dublin hoped the agreement would cut the ground
from under Sinn Fein.
   The mainly Catholic IRA wants to unite Northern Ireland with the
95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   On the Protestant side, the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party
faces allegations that former allies in a shadowy movement called
Ulster Resistance plotted to swap stolen missile technology from a
Belfast arms factory for South African guns.
   Ulster Resistance was formed to fight the Anglo-Irish Agreement
and was associated with Democratic Unionist Party leader Rev. Ian
Paisley, who says these links were subsequently severed.
   Also discomforting to the Unionist parties is a renewed outbreak
of sectarian killings by Protestant gunmen, the latest of which
claimed the life of a Catholic carpenter in Belfast on Monday.
   Malachy Trainor, 34, was buried Wednesday in his home town of
Kilkeel, and in his eulogy, Bishop Cahal Daly blamed the murder on
``the creeping oil slick of sectarianism.''
   He said many recent murders stemmed from ``plain, old-fashioned,
unreconstructed anti-Roman Catholic bigotry, based on outmoded
theologies long since left far behind by world Protestantism.''

   A stubborn pony brought to a third-floor
science classroom was trapped for five hours and had to be sedated
twice before firemen could carry it from the high school building.
   ``The pony went up the steps readily but would not come down
again,'' Fire Lt. Rick Balog said Wednesday.
   The 400-pound pony named Penny was finally freed Wednesday night
when 10 firemen and veterinarian William Lake, of Jefferson,
carried the sedated animal downstairs in a basket-like stretcher.
Balog said it took two tries to sedate Penny.
   ``The problem wasn't the pony's weight but the fact that she
wanted to kick like a bucking bronco,'' Balog said. ``We got a few
bruised shins, believe me.''
   Balog said Penny attended classes at Ashtabula High School all
day as part of a student's project for science courses. He said
students, teachers and administrators discovered at the end of the
day that Penny violently refused to walk down stairs.
   ``We don't do animal rescues, but it was hard to refuse,'' he
said. ``They were begging us.''

<HEAD>Man Arrested on Charges of Planting Bombs in Small Indiana Town</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man in custody today on charges of
planting 13 bombs around his southern Indiana hometown last summer
may have been targeting a state lawmaker, authorities said.
   John M. Hubbard III, 31, was arrested Wednesday with Jerry A.
Conrad, 42, a former co-worker in Salem, said U.S. Attorney Deborah
J. Daniels. Both were being held without bond at the Marion County
Jail.
   Although she wouldn't discuss a motive, Daniels said state Rep.
Frank Newkirk Jr., the 32-year-old son of Salem's mayor, may have
been a target.
   ``Hubbard told other people that he felt very strongly about Mr.
Newkirk and that he hated him,'' she said. ``He didn't say why.''
   A grand jury was scheduled to convene today in Indianapolis to
consider 29 preliminary charges against each suspect: 14 counts of
manufacturing destructive devices, 13 counts of attempting to
damage property, one count of conspiracy to manufacture destructive
devices, and one count of unlawful possession of stolen explosives.
   Convictions on all counts could bring maximum penalties of 285
years in prison and $7 million in fines.
   During a hearing in New Albany, a federal magistrate granted a
government motion for a psychological examination of Hubbard and
set a May 31 competency hearing.
   The motion said Hubbard ``has a history of emotional problems
stemming in part from substance and alcohol abuse.''
   Hubbard is ``a self-styled `survivalist' who has stated that he
is `armed' for a `confrontation' with the police or anyone else,
and that he will never go to jail, even if convicted at a trial,''
the motion said.
   ``In December 1988, Hubbard twice telephoned the Nicaraguan
Embassy in Washington, D.C., asking for political asylum; Hubbard
claims to be personally acquainted with Daniel Ortega,'' the
Nicaraguan president.
   The bombs were found July 5 around Salem, a town of 5,500
residents. Seven bombs, which were in paper grocery sacks, had been
stashed under bridges. The remainder were hidden near businesses
and government buildings.
   None exploded. Three burned, causing minor damage.
   Hubbard, who went to school with Newkirk, considered the state
representative to be ``a lifelong rival,'' according to an
affidavit.
   ``There are indications in the affidavit that John Hubbard bore
some animosity toward Frank Newkirk Jr., and bore some animosity
toward an employer of his,'' Daniels told reporters in her
Indianapolis office.
   Newkirk acknowledged that he may have been the target.
   ``I know from his comments in the newspaper and from our
conversations he considers himself to be a very liberal person and
I'm pretty conservative,'' he said. ``Also, I believed from our
discussions that he has a dislike or resentment for government, and
I may represent government to him.''
   Newkirk said he and Hubbard occasionally spoke when they met on
the street, but he does not know Conrad, who worked with Hubbard at
Ferraloy Industries in Salem.
   ``This has been a real stressful time for our family, and we're
very relieved that the arrest has been made,'' Newkirk said.
   Newkirk noted that he was married 11 years ago Wednesday and
called the arrests ``a nice anniversary present.''
   Ron Marker, whose sister found 25 sticks of dynamite wired to
explode behind the family service station, said the arrests brought
some relief to Salem.
   ``It's been going on for a long time,'' he said. ``I hope they
got them.''

<HEAD>Pepsi to Provide $4.5 Million for Scholarships, Tutoring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at two high schools with high dropout
rates can earn extra scholarship money by keeping their grades up.
   The four-year $4.5 million pilot program at the schools in
Detroit and Dallas will provide scholarships for students who earn
C averages, have good attendance and avoid disciplinary problems,
Pepsi-Cola Co. officials said Wednesday.
   Fifty teachers chosen at each school to tutor and counsel
children will receive $1,000 each.
   The program was announced in assemblies this week at
Southwestern High School in Detroit and L.G. Pinkston High School
in Dallas.
   The company hopes to encourage students to set and meet goals,
and give them enough financial assistance after graduation to help
them succeed, said Craig Weatherup, president of Pepsi-Cola, a
division of Pepsico Inc.
   ``We hope this program will serve as a model for other
corporations because we need their involvement,'' he said.
``Continued failure to make the benefits of our economic system
available to all of our citizens would be disastrous.'' Michigan
officials welcomed Pepsi's interest, though they said the state
already guarantees college tuition help for students below poverty
level who graduate from high school.
   At Southwestern, whose students are 80 percent black or other
minorities, the dropout rate is about 33 percent.
   Pinkston has a 99 percent minority enrollment, with more than
half the students from impoverished homes. Twenty-one percent of
Pinkston's students dropped out last year.
   The program will let students earn scholarship credit of $250 a
semester, beginning in the 1989-90 school year.
   A senior graduating in 1990 could win $500 in assistance, while
a ninth grader could earn a $2,000 scholarship by the time of
graduation in 1993.
   The funds are for accredited education or for other training
such as vocational school.
   Each school will receive an additional grant of $4,000 for
administrative costs.

<HEAD>New Process Announced for Forming Microchip Components at Lower Temperatures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new process for forming ultrathin
components of microchips eventually will allow significantly more
information to be stored on them, University of Texas researchers
say.
   They announced Wednesday that their process lowers by hundreds
of degrees the temperature at which thin layers of crystalline
silicon material _ the building blocks of microchips _ can be grown.
   Although the process won't be fully felt in the microelectronics
industry for a decade, university officials called it a major
breakthrough.
   A.F. Tasch, a developer of the process and a professor of
computer and electrical engineering, said using lower temperatures
for crystalline silicon growth would allow much smaller transistors
to be built and many more transistors to be put on a single
microchip.
   The result: a chip that could hold substantially more data while
remaining the same size.
   He called it a major step in paving the way for the
microelectronics industry to go ``from millions to billions of
devices on a single chip.''
   ``If you want to make integrated circuits that have greater
computing power or store more information, you have to make
transistors smaller and smaller,'' Tasch said.
   ``The industry ... is reaching a point where these transistor
structures we are using today cannot be shrunk any smaller.
   ``In order to come up with new transistor concepts which work at
even smaller dimensions, whatever you build has to be done with
lower temperatures.''
   Tasch and his University of Texas colleague, S.K. Banerjee,
worked with a team at the Research Triangle Institute in North
Carolina to develop the process.
   Traditionally, making microchips involves a series of steps at
temperatures often exceeding 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit. The new
process allows single-crystal growth at temperatures as low as 300
degrees Fahrenheit.
   Tasch said the old heat level has limited the number of
materials and the size of the transistors that can be combined on a
single chip.
   ``If you have high temperature treatment like that used in
traditional fabrication, you cannot maintain these small
dimensions,'' Tasch said. ``All the details get washed out. The
high-temperature process causes the materials to mix.''
   Shrinking the size and improving the capacity of computer chips
topped a list of 22 technologies designated by the U.S. government
in March as critical to national security.
   ``We're talking about the ability to store the equivalent
information in a few sets of encyclopedias on a future microchip
the size of your thumbnail. Such chips will handle all of this data
at supercomputer speeds,'' Tasch said.
   Tasch and his co-workers, who began their project about 2{ years
ago, are scheduled to present their findings at the Electronic
Materials Conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
next month.

<HEAD>Dollar Continues to Gain, Nikkei Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained for a sixth day and closed today
at an 18-month high against the yen, while the key index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange fell.
   The dollar finished at 138.88 yen, up 1.18 yen from Wednesday's
137.70-yen close. It was the dollar's highest close since 138.55
yen on Oct. 30, 1987.
   The dollar, which now has gained 4.44 yen in six trading days,
opened today at 139.45 and ranged between 138.60 yen and 139.48 yen.
   Daiwa Securities trader Mitsuhiko Kinugasa attributed the
dollar's surge to an improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.
   The United States reported on Wednesday that the deficit in
March fell to $8.86 billion from $9.82 billion in February.
   The dollar fell from its opening level, however, on dollar
selling by speculative investors and the Bank of Japan, which has
intervened to support the yen, Kinugasa said. The central bank
reportedly sold about $1 billion. It does not comment publicly on
its intervention.
   Kinugasa said the market still was expecting a stronger dollar.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, lost 136.12 points, or 0.40 percent, to close at 33,856.33.
It gained 66.00 points on Wednesday.
   Investors were selling spot shares mainly for arbitrage, but
afternoon purchases by speculative investors helped erase some of
the losses, said Genjiro Sasaki, a dealer with New Japan Securities
Co.
   ``The market lacked buying incentives largely due to the yen's
weakness on the foreign exchange market,'' he said.
   The yen's downward trend and uncertainties about a possible rise
in Japanese interest rates left investors unable to determine the
likely direction of trading, he said.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 600
million shares, down from Wednesday's 800 million.

<HEAD>Memorial for Author Erected at School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raymond Carver was a poor student with poor
prospects when he graduated from Yakima High School in 1956.
   Now his stories are taught in English classes, and this week the
late author became only the second graduate of the school to be
honored with a permanent display.
   The other is former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas, another maverick who rose to prominence from low
beginnings.
   ``It's not often that you have a graduate go on to receive world
recognition for his work as a writer,'' Linda Brown, an English
teacher who led the drive for a Carver memorial, said Wednesday.
   ``It's sad when we are not recognized more fully by our hometown
and school while alive,'' she said. ``But it's better late than
never.''
   Monday's dedication was attended by Carver's widow, poet Tess
Gallagher, of Port Angeles.
   ``I think the things that started him on the road started
here,'' Ms. Gallagher said.
   The homemade, wood-framed memorial to Carver, who died of cancer
at age 50 last year, contains a photograph, some of his poetry,
some of his fishing lures, a fountain pen, a white rose, and a
handwritten note with a premise for a story.
   ``Argument between couple but narrator only sees back of man's
head the whole time,'' the note says.
   In a temporary display at the library are Carver's high school
diploma and a senior yearbook showing a cleancut young man whose
only listed activity was working on the school paper as a junior.
   The actual school building that Carver attended was razed years
ago. Davis High School was built on the site.
   It is perhaps fitting that Carver's memorial is at a school that
has both the state's highest dropout rate, over 50 percent
according to state figures, and a reputation for innovative
education programs such as three-day single-topic seminars for the
entire student body.
   Ms. Brown said Carver's life illustrates that students who get
the best grades are not always the most talented, and that people
mature at different rates.
   ``Many of the kids who drop out of schools ... are gifted
kids,'' she said.
   Carver was born in Clatskanie, Ore., and grew up in Yakima. His
father worked in a lumber mill and his mother was a waitress.
   He moved to California after graduation and began to be
published a few years later while an undergraduate at Humboldt
State. He later was a janitor at a Sacramento hospital, and for a
decade was an alcoholic. He later taught at Syracuse University in
New York.
   Widespread critical acclaim didn't come until the 1970s, and it
was only in the 1980s that a major outpouring of his books
appeared. The latest ``A New Path To The Waterfall,'' is due out
soon.
   His works were translated into 20 languages and near the end of
his life he was widely regarded as one of the nation's finest
writers.
   His writings reflected the desperate underclass, caught in
dead-end jobs with few prospects. Many were inspired by his
impoverished youth in Yakima, one of the reasons a BBC television
crew was in town recently filming a documentary on his life.
   ``Carver's life in Yakima was bleak, perhaps, but it was still
his home,'' Ms. Brown said. ``Ray Carver characters are the people
I've met in Yakima.''

   Students held aloft a black and white coffin
inscribed with the words ``guandao'' _ official corruption _ while
drum-beating, flag-waving colleagues sounded a death knell and the
crowds roared with approval.
   The scene, on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, was one
of the constant reminders that protesters who have taken over the
streets of Beijing consider halting corruption as important as
bringing about democratic reform.
   Antipathy toward official corruption is particularly strong
among blue- and white-collar workers who have joined student ranks
in demanding radical change from the ruling Communist Party.
   Corruption is endemic in Chinese life.
   On the petty side, party and government officials use their
positions to obtain precious train or concert tickets, find jobs
for in-laws, commandeer spacious apartments or weasel trips abroad.
   More seriously, officials take advantage of the nation's
economic disorder to get hold of scarce raw materials such as coal
and fertilizer at low state-set prices and then sell them at far
higher prices on the free market.
   Officials' access to sought-after goods has also made them
easily susceptible to bribery. Many consider receiving money,
lavish banquets, color television sets or stereos all part of the
job.
   There is deep resentment of nepotism and the charmed lives of
luxury the sons and daughters of high officials enjoy.
   One of the first posters to go up at Beijing University during
the current student unrest listed several dozen senior officials
who it alleged got their jobs because of family connections.
   Premier Li Peng, it noted, was the adopted son of the late Chou
En-lai. People's Liberation Army Chief of Staff Chi Haotian is
President Yang Shangkun's son-in-law. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping's
son Deng Pufang formerly headed a business concern that has been
accused of shady dealings.
   A recent survey of 10,000 workers indicated corruption is
regarded as China's most serious problem. Forty-six percent listed
corruption as China's most serious social problem, and 63 percent
said improper deeds by party members is a major political problem.
   The government has acknowledged its shortcomings and tried to
crack down.
   ``All malpractices such as corruption, embezzlement or
misappropriation of public funds, and the squandering of funds
allocated for helping poor people or doing relief work have
seriously harmed the interests of the state and distorted the image
of the party,'' the official party paper People's Daily said.
   Chinese courts handled 37,000 cases of official profiteering
last year, up 50 percent from 1987, and 101 embezzlers and
bribe-takers were sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
   Local governments have set up neighborhood corruption centers
where ordinary people can report official abuses of power without
fear of recrimination.
   But as the hundreds of banners on central Tiananmen Square
reading ``Down with corruption'' attest, the government has made
little headway in rooting out this deeply ingrained problem.

<HEAD>Consumer Reports Says Ford Car Tips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car buyers should avoid purchasing the Ford
Bronco II because two of its wheels leave the ground during
accident-avoidance tests, according to Consumer Reports.
   In its June issue, Consumer Reports said the sport-utility car
handled poorly, though deeming it better handling than the Suzuki
Samurai, which the magazine said last June rated ``not acceptable.''
   The magazine's tests showed that the Samurai had a greater
propensity to roll over than the Bronco II. But statistics compiled
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicate that
fatal rollover accidents are much higher with the Bronco II, it
said.
   Ford disputes that conclusion.
   The magazine said that federal statistics on deaths in rollovers
in 1987 indicated there were 19 fatal rollovers for every 100,000
Bronco IIs, compared with six per 100,000 in Samurais.
   The magazine, while critical of the Bronco IIs handling,
emphasized that the Ford vehicle's behavior ``was still a far cry
from the not acceptable performance of the Suzuki Samurai.''
   ``Considering the Bronco II's rollover fatality record in
combination with its poor emergency handling _ and considering the
wide availability of similar vehicles with better handling and
better accident statistics _ we think it's wise to avoid the Bronco
II,'' the magazine said.
   Ford has challenged the federal death statistics, saying they
are misleading because only accidents involving 1986 and 1987
models were counted.
   The automaker has argued that results would be in line with
other vehicles of the same type if all accidents were counted since
introduction of the Bronco II in 1983.
   The automaker also challenged the validity of what it called ``a
single, driver-influenced'' test ``in which the driver's input can
cause a vehicle to pass or fail.''
   Ford said in a comparable accident avoidance maneuver conducted
for the automaker, the Bronco II did not lift even one wheel off
the ground.
   Ford said the Bronco II is a safe vehicle ``when it is driven
according to common-sense safe driving practices.''
   The magazine, however, said that when its test drivers began
steering around an obstacle, ``the Bronco II's inside front wheel
lifted off the ground.''
   It said the inside rear wheel also lifted off the ground during
runs through the course at speeds of 42 mph.
   As with the Samurai last year, the Bronco IIs were fitted with
outriggers to prevent rolling over, said Consumer Union, the
magazine's publisher.
   In all the test runs, drivers were able to get the Bronco IIs
back down and finish the course, the magazine said.
   ``At no time did the Bronco II come close to rolling completely
up onto the safety outriggers,'' it said. ``In identical maneuvers
conducted last year, the Samurai lifted both wheels quickly,
rolling completely up onto the safety outriggers.''
   Suzuki denied that its car was unstable, but Samurai sales
plunged after the magazine article last year. The car then made a
strong comeback when Suzuki reduced its price.

<HEAD>Two Veteran U.S. Drug Agents Held on Bribery Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal drug agents who thought they had
developed a scheme to take money from drug traffickers found
themselves targeted by an elaborate sting, authorities said.
   Federal investigators said they caught the two longtime Drug
Enforcement Administration agents with help from a confidential
informant who posed as a drug trafficker.
   The arrests came five weeks after another Miami-based DEA agent
was arrested on drugs charges.
   Agents Drew Bunnell and Al Iglesias didn't know the man was
taking orders from the DEA's own internal investigation unit,
according to Tom Cash, the DEA's special agent in charge in Miami.
   Bunnell and Iglesias appeared Wednesday before federal
magistrate. Both were charged with bribery, a felony punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Bunnell, assigned to the DEA office in Ecuador, was ordered held
without bond pending a full hearing Monday. His arraignment was
scheduled for May 30.
   Iglesias, of the DEA's Miami office, was ordered released on a
$500,000 personal surety bond. His arraignment was set for June 6.
   The informant told each agent he had a large sum of money given
to him by drug traffickers, and that the money was to be used to
buy and transport cocaine into the United States, Cash said.
   ``Proper procedure would require agents in possession of this
information to immediately open an investigation and conduct a
reverse sting operation to arrest the traffickers,'' Cash said.
   Instead, he said, the two agents told the informant that they
would not investigate if they could keep the money. In return,
Iglesias and Bunnel allegedly promised to protect the informant
against retaliation.
   Bunnell had nine years' experience with the DEA and Iglesias 14,
officials said.
   Bunnell was arrested near Miami International Airport, and
Iglesias was arrested at his Miami home, said Michael A. Pavlick, a
senior DEA inspector in Washington.
   Both agents were placed on administrative leave with pay, Cash
said.
   Authorities said the investigation began in July 1988, when the
confidential informant told the DEA he had met with Bunnell in
December 1987 and discussed stealing cocaine money.
   The DEA then began monitoring telephone calls between the
informant and Bunnell, authorities said. The informant led Bunnell
to believe he had taken $215,000 in cocaine traffickers' money,
authorities said.
   Bunnell received $7,000 before his arrest, but had expected to
get $100,000, authorities said. The informant also gave Bunnell's
wife $5,000, authorities said.
   Iglesias got $700 in cash and an $11,000 Rolex Presidential
wristwatch ``purchased from funds which Iglesias believed were
taken from the drug traffickers,'' Cash said.
   In the previous arrest, agent Jorge Villar was arrested in
mid-April on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and
conspiring to commit bribery. He was arrested with a former
Metro-Dade police officer.

<HEAD>Tass: Authorities in China Have Lost Control</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China-Protest, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Tass news agency waited until
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev left Beijing today to report that
police in China's capital, confronted by more than 1 million
demonstrators, had ``lost control.''
   As Gorbachev spoke at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday,
armies of protesters filled the streets to demand democratic
reforms. The rallies spread to at least 20 provincial capitals,
including Shanghai, where Gorbachev traveled today to end his
four-day trip.
   The giant demonstrations, the largest show of defiance in
Communist China's 40 years, made headlines worldwide as they
disrupted Gorbachev's meetings with top Chinese leaders, the first
Soviet-Chinese summit in three decades.
   However, a 45-minute report on the Soviet evening television
news program ``Vremya'' on Wednesday on Gorbachev's trip made no
mention of the protests, instead shoring him strolling along the
Great Wall and joking with young people about Chinese cooking.
   With Gorbachev in Shanghai today, Tass began reporting in detail
on the demonstrations, saying that in Beijing ``police do not take
any measures to restore order in the streets and authorities have
in effect lost control over the situation.''
   Continuing the neutral line espoused by Gorbachev on the
demonstrators and their demands, Tass reported without comment that
protesters supported students on a hunger strike and were demanding
the resignation of some of China's leaders.
   Gorbachev said Wednesday in Beijing that ``a difficult, painful
but political dialogue is going on between the leadership, youth
and public concerning these events, and it seems to me that we
should welcome that fact.''
   Since Gorbachev came to power in March 1985, there have been
numerous demonstrations in the Soviet Union, including nationalist
protests in Armenia that have assembled hundreds of thousands of
people. But their scale was dwarfed by the rallies in China.
   ``Traffic on the city's main streets is paralyzed,'' Tass
reported from Beijing. ``Out of all central newspapers, only The
People's Daily, the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China, was delivered to subscribers.''

<HEAD>Former Federal Prosecutor Announces Run for New York City Mayoralty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former federal prosecutor formally announced
his candidacy for mayor by promising to combat violent crime on the
city's streets and corruption in its offices.
   In announcing his bid for the Republican ticket Wednesday,
Rudolph W. Giuliani stressed his 5{ years as U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, a post he left in January.
   He said none of his rivals ``understands the justice system, and
the criminal justice system in particular, the way I do.''
   Giuliani, 44, said he would hire more police, increase jail
capacity and seek to reform the juvenile justice system. To handle
increased arrests, he would add court space and prosecutors.
   ``Now is the time to take back our city from the violent
criminals on the streets and the white-collar criminals in their
office suites, from the drug dealers in abandoned buildings and the
crooked politicians who have abandoned their oath of office,'' he
said.
   Giuliani, who won a racketeering conviction of once powerful
Democratic boss Stanley Friedman, said he would make the
elimination of corruption in city government a priority.
   As a GOP hopeful running in a city where registered Democrats
outnumber Republicans 5-1, Giuliani compared himself to Fiorello
LaGuardia, another Italian-American and Republican who faced
similar odds when he won the mayoralty in 1933.
   Giuliani pledged that he, like LaGuardia, would ``kick out an
old, tired and corrupt administration'' and ``restore to New York
honest, decent and effective government.''
   Polls have shown Giuliani would defeat Mayor Edward I. Koch,
Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, former Metropolitan
Transportation Authority Chairman Richard Ravitch and city
Comptroller Harrison Goldin. The first three have declared their
candidacy for the Democratic nomination; Goldin's formal
announcement is expected next week.
   Koch said he is not discouraged by the polls because he is
confident that his 12-year tenure as mayor will attract voters. He
said Giuliani ``knows nothing about government.''
   Giuliani's first hurdle is the Republican primary in September,
when he faces a well-financed challenge from the cosmetics heir,
Ronald Lauder.
   Last month, Giuliani won the endorsement of the city's Liberal
Party to assure himself a place on the November ballot. The city's
last Republican mayor, John V. Lindsay, did the same.

<HEAD>20 Tornados Whip Texas; Snow Falls in Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell in the Rockies and temperatures dipped to freezing in
the Pacific Northwest early today, while thunderstorms soaked parts
of Texas following a night in which more than 20 tornadoes whipped
through the state.
   One of Wednesday's tornados killed a woman in Jarrell, 40 miles
from Austin, and demolished 33 houses there. Three people were
swept to their deaths in swollen Texas creeks and 50 suffered
storm-related injuries.
   Thunderstorms lingered over southeastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma
and western Louisiana this morning. Rain was forecast for today
from the Mississippi Valley across eastern portions of the Central
Plains, Oklahoma, eastern Texas, western Mississippi, western
Tennessee, western Kentucky, Illinois and Wisconsin.
   Thunderstorms flung golf ball-sized hail near Weimar and
nickle-sized hail at Houston and Vinson, Okla.
   An early morning thunderstorm spat golf-ball sized hail
southeast of Chatham, La.
   Storms drenched Freestone County, Texas, with 5 inches of rain,
and flash flooding washed out roads and bridges.
   Afternoon and evening thunderstorms also caused some flooding in
Ochiltree County of the Texas Panhandle, and in Texas and Beaver
counties of the Oklahoma panhandle.
   It also rained in the Red River and upper Mississippi valleys.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hour period ending at 2 a.m.
EDT included 4 inches at Houston; 1.74 inches at Fort Polk, La.;
.72 inches at Wenatchee, Wash.; and .54 inches at Dodge City, Kan.
   A cold front was bringing rainshowers east of the Rockies, with
snow reported in some of the higher elevations. A snow advisory was
in effect for the Cascades of Oregon and Washington.
   Strong and gusty winds also accompanied the cold front in the
Northwest.
   Fair weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   The high Wednesday was 100 degrees at Kingsville, Texas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms the length
of Mississippi Valley and across the eastern Plains, from Texas to
Wisconsin. Showers and occasional thunderstorms were expected in
Montana, with showers extending across the Pacific Northwest and
turning to snow in the higher reaches of the Cascades.
   Highs were expected in the 50s and 60s over the Pacific
Northwest; in the 60s along the California coast, northeastern
Minnesota and over the eastern Plains; in the 80s in much of New
York and the lower Great Lakes, northern Florida, the central Gulf
coast to northern Texas and New Mexico; in the 90s over Florida,
south Texas and the desert Southwest; and in the 70s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Sexton Summit, Ore., to 82 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Interior Chief Announces Alaskan Offshore Drilling Delay</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Tanker Spill, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department announced a year's
postponement of a Gulf of Alaska oil lease sale because of
environmental concerns, even though state officials said a sale
there posed little risk.
   A spokesman for Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper urged the federal
agency to reconsider a lease sale in Bristol Bay, the state's
richest fishing area, because the state believes it poses a much
greater potential ecological danger.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said Wednesday the gulf sale
proposed for August 1990, in an area known as Lease Sale 114, was
delayed because additional time is needed to assess damage from the
Exxon oil spill in Prince William Sound. The tanker Exxon Valdez
hit a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into
the sound March 24.
   Terence O'Malley, Cowper's spokesman, called the delay
``probably a good idea in light of Prince William Sound. ...
However, since there's probably not that great of a chance of oil
being discovered there the risk is minimal.''
   Alaska authorities want the Interior Department to reconsider
its Bristol Bay lease sale, ``where the risks of a catastrophic oil
spills are much greater,'' O'Malley said.
   Drilling has not started there, but nine oil companies last year
paid the federal government $95 million for the right to explore
for oil and gas.
   The state went to court to block the leases, but lost before the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It plans an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court if Congress or the Bush administration doesn't buy
back the leases.
   The environmental assessment for the gulf sale had been
scheduled for publication in September. If the Interior Department
decides next year to go ahead with a new review, additional public
comment will be sought.
   Lujan said Interior officials will work closely with Cowper and
local communities.
   The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday quoted Lujan aide Steve
Goldstein as saying the decision ``should not be read as a
cancellation'' of the lease project. ``This is a postponement to
gather information while new facts are coming to light.''
   Another aide, Mark Stephenson in Washington, D.C., said that the
delay should take about a year because it will take that long to
evaluate the Valdez spill impact.
   Lujan's official announcement came at the start of the Interior
chief's Western tour with an itinerary including the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area headquarters, the Presidio Army base near
the Golden Gate Bridge, Yosemite National Park, Las Vegas, the Fort
Irwin National Training Center and a meeting with California Gov.
George Deukmejian.

   Prosecutors today searched the homes and offices of
two members of Parliament suspected of taking bribes in an
influence-peddling scandal that has generated a national leadership
crisis.
   Also today, officials of the ruling and opposition parties
agreed to summon former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to testify
under oath in Parliament next Wednesday about his links to the
scandal.
   The opposition has been boycotting lower house sessions to
demand testimony by Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of
dubious stock deals including some purchases by his own aides.
   The opposition position stiffened after the governing party
rammed the fiscal 1989 budget through the lower house in its
absence on April 28.
   The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office searched various
offices and residences of the two legislators, Takao Fujinami, 56,
and Katsuya Ikeda, 51 _ who on Wednesday became the first elected
officials to be interrogated as suspects in the scandal.
   Prosecutors again summoned the two for questioning today.
   According to Japanese legal custom, summoning politicians for
interrogation is regarded as the equivalent of an arrest. Japanese
law protects lawmakers from being jailed when Parliament is in
session.
   Because prosecutors are required to disclose their suspicions to
obtain special permission from Parliament to arrest lawmakers, they
routinely delay pressing formal charges until completing repeated
summonses and interrogation.
   Prosecutors are expected soon to press formal charges, the
equivalent of an indictment, against Fujinami and Ikeda.
   Ikeda, former secretary general of the opposition Komeito (Clean
Government Party), and Fujinami, of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, are suspected of receiving bribes from the
Recruit Co. information conglomerate in exchange for using their
political clout to help the firm.
   Fujinami, an eight-term member of the House of Representatives,
was chief Cabinet secretary under Nakasone. He once was considered
a rising star in the Liberal Democratic Party.
   Fujinami has acknowledged an aide in 1986 bought 12,000 shares
in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a property subsidiary of Recruit, at a
discounted price before the company's stock was publicly traded.
The transaction brought profits of about $191,000.
   Ikeda, a former journalist and four-term member of the House of
Representatives, was also involved in a purchase of Recruit Cosmos
shares through his brother, Yuzuru, who bought 5,000 shares in the
firm and gained about $73,530 from the transaction.
   In both cases, the politicians denied personal involvement in
the transactions, although it was later disclosed that the bulk of
the profits went into their bank accounts.
   Ikeda said Tuesday that he planned to resign his Parliament
seat. Governing party officials denied reports that Fujinami also
would resign, but they indicated he might have to do so if formally
charged.
   Komeito Chairman Junya Yano became the third party leader to
step down in the Recruit scandal on Wednesday.
   He follows Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who is resigning as
head of the Liberal Democratic Party and thus as prime minister,
and Saburo Tsukamoto, who stepped down in February as head of the
opposition Democratic Socialist Party.
   Governing party leaders still are trying to find someone
untainted by the scandal who is suitable to be the new prime
minister.
   Some 160 politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen bought
bargain-priced unlisted shares in a Recruit subsidiary and made
large profits when the price soared after public trading began.
   Of 17 politicians linked to purchases of Recruit shares, 11 were
members of the Cabinet of Nakasone, who was prime minister at the
time of the share transactions.

<HEAD>FBI Director Pitches Story Lines to Television Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House, Pentagon and other
governmental agencies have suffered television's bite, but the FBI
has enjoyed broadcasting bliss, and the agency's director wants it
to stay that way.
   In a speech before several hundred television producers, FBI
Director William Sessions urged them Wednesday to continue their
largely favorable depiction of the bureau.
   ``FBI stories are very much a part of television history,''
Sessions said. ``I would like to think that future FBI chronicles
on television might reflect current issues ... and crime problems
that the FBI faces in the closing years of the 20th century.''
   Sessions enthusiastically recounted the FBI's successful
investigation of the Chicago gang El Rukns, sprinkling his account
with colorful images of an omnipotent and clever FBI.
   Encouraging the producers to make more FBI-oriented programs,
Sessions said, ``Our investigations of the last 10 years, I
believe, are more intriguing and have more intriguing facets than
ever before.''
   Sessions specifically thanked the makers of NBC's ``Unsolved
Mysteries'' and the Fox Broadcasting Corp.'s ``America's Most
Wanted.''
   He said both programs, seeking tips on current law-enforcement
investigations, ``help to demonstrate the depth of the
responsibility (of) the FBI ... I would say the portrayal (on these
shows) gives a sense to the American public of the difficulties we
face in trying to bring these people back.''
   One of the most successful TV series was ``The F.B.I.,'' on ABC
from 1965 to 1974. The show starred Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as the
Inspector Lewis Erskine, and the show never failed to portray the
FBI in anything but a glowing light.
   Former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover gave ``The F.B.I.'' full
cooperation and opened up the agency's headquarters for occasional
filming of background scenes. Many episodes concluded with requests
for information on the FBI's most-wanted list, including a 1968
appeal for Martin Luther King assassin James Earl Ray.
   ``The F.B.I.'' was updated by ABC in 1981, but ``Today's
F.B.I.,'' starring Mike Connors, lasted less than a year. The
sequel also had the approval of the FBI, which gave the show's
makers real FBI files.
   Come fall, NBC will have a new drama called ``Mancuso, FBI,''
based on the courageous FBI agent seen in the network's miniseries,
``Favorite Son.''
   Mancuso, played by Robert Loggia, was portrayed as a
toss-out-the-book maverick, marking time for his retirement, when
politically motivated FBI bosses gave him an impossible assignment
because they were sure he would fail.
   The FBI had no consulting role in the miniseries, and if the
character stays true to form in the weekly series _ still in the
development stage _ the FBI can be expected to reject any
involvement.

<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Brenda swept into the
South China Sea and headed for China today after killing at least
14 people, disrupting air service and leaving thousands homeless,
officials said.
   At least 43 people were missing in three storm-related accidents
at sea, officials said.
   The tropical storm, the first to hit the Philippines this year,
came ashore Wednesday on Samar Island with winds up to 63 mph and
passed about 10 miles south of the capital after sunset.
   The storm uprooted trees, interrupted electricity service,
ripped off roofs and flooded streets in greater Manila, which has
more than 7 million residents.
   Scattered damage was reported throughout southern and central
Luzon, the main Philippine island.
   Philippine Airlines canceled 50 domestic flights and the Coast
Guard prevented at least six ships from leaving the port of Manila.
   Officials said reports of damage and casualties were delayed
because Brenda knocked out communications to the Bicol region of
southeastern Luzon and to parts of the central Visayas islands
which bore the brunt of the storm.
   The weather bureau said Brenda was 230 miles northwest of Manila
this afternoon heading toward China at 9 mph and packing peak winds
of 69 mph.

<HEAD>Surprise State Budget Surplus Raises Stakes, Hopes In Teachers Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surprise state budget surplus has raised
hopes for an end to a four-day-old teachers' strike that has
crippled education for more than a half-million students in the
nation's second-largest school district.
   The state expects to receive an extra $2.5 billion in the next
two years, Gov. George Deukmejian said Wednesday. As much as $228
million of the surplus could go to the Los Angeles Unified School
District.
   Negotiators in the teachers' strike planned to resume
negotiations today.
   The third day of the strike Wednesday was marked by dwindling
student attendance, a report of a Molotov cocktail thrown at a
school and the arrest of a striking teacher who allegedly hit a
substitute teacher with a picket sign.
   Although educators had expected some kind of state budget
windfall, the size of the surplus came as a surprise to both sides
in the teachers' strike.
   Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, reacted
to the news by changing the union's pay demand from a 21 percent
raise over two years to 26 percent raise over three years.
   ``This is very good news,'' Johnson said. ``If they don't want
to settle with us now, they just want to break the union.''
   But the district offered no change in its offer of a 21.5
percent raise over three years, citing the findings of a state
fact-finders report released Wednesday. The report said the
teachers should accept the district's proposal as fair and
reasonable.
   Board of Education President Roberta Weintraub said the report
``totally exonerates the board of education ... and I urge each and
every teacher to go back to work.''
   The report was prepared by attorney Geraldine Randall, who began
investigating the dispute last March when the 16-month contract
negotiation reached an impasse.
   She was selected jointly by the district and the teachers'
union, but Johnson dismissed the findings as biased against
teachers.
   After the governor's announcement, Ms. Weintraub said a meeting
had been called between district and teachers union officials. At
issue is how much money the district should expect to receive out
of the surplus.
   A ballot measure passed in November requires the state to give
schools virtually all revenue over a set spending limit. But
lawmakers have indicated they may try to send more of the excess
funds to other areas.
   More than 250,000 of the district's 594,000 students skipped
school in the nation's second-largest school district Wednesday.
   The teachers' union said 23,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and
librarians were honoring the picket lines. Striking teachers
account for almost two-thirds of the district's 32,000-member
teaching work force.
   The district said about 8,200 teachers came to work Wednesday,
about 3,000 fewer teachers than the approximately 11,250 who
reported to work Tuesday.
   About 12,250 teachers came to work the first day of the strike.
   Security was beefed up at Hollenbeck Junior High School on
Wednesday after three Molotov cocktail firebombs were thrown at the
school overnight. Nobody was injured and the school suffered only
superficial damage.

<HEAD>Boston City Councilor Proposes Students Pay $5 Monthly Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city councilor has proposed that college
students, who comprise 20 percent of Boston's population but don't
pay taxes, pay a $5 monthly levy to support the financially
crunched public library.
   Making students pay for city services is an old idea gaining new
luster because of the specter of slashed budgets.
   ``Sixty dollars a year isn't going to make them broke when
they're spending up to $20,000 a year to go to some of these fancy
schools we have in Boston,'' said Councilor Christopher A.
Iannella. ``We have great research facilities and those students
don't pay a cent.''
   All proceeds would go to the Boston Public Library, which is
planning to lay off up to 120 employees and close its 25 branch
libraries four days a week when the city slashes its budget by more
than $1 million next year.
   Boston is host to 32 colleges and universities with an estimated
120,000 students. But half of its real estate is tax-exempt because
it belongs to universities, hospitals or other non-profit
institutions.
   ``Colleges and universities do not pay any tax or gratuity, yet
we supply them with public works, safe streets, police and fire
protection,'' Iannella said in placing the library tax proposal
before the council Wednesday for the second time in seven years.
   His plan would tax full-time college students no more than $60 a
year and part-timers no more than $20 annually.
   Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Education and the National
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities said they
hadn't heard of attempts elsewhere to tax college students for
local services.
   The tax would not apply to some of the area's best-known
schools: Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, which are in Cambridge, and Tufts University in Medford.
   The president of the library's board of trustees, Kevin F.
Moloney, said the library needs money but won't take a position on
whether taxing students is the best way to raise it.
   ``We're getting slammed from far too many directions,'' said
Stephen Mazzulli, an editor at the student newspaper on the
University of Massachusetts's Boston campus. ``They're upping our
tuition, they're tacking on fees. They added $100 just because they
screwed up the (state) budget, and now they want more.''
   Mazzulli said the average age of a student at his school is 28,
and 80 percent work more than 30 hours a week.
   Northeastern University student Joel Kurth said he uses the
Boston Public Library regularly and wouldn't mind paying for it.
   Iannella first proposed the library tax in 1982 when Boston, on
the verge of bankruptcy, began laying off police and teachers and
closing libraries. The city council passed the tax, but the
Legislature refused to approve it.

   Two men arrested after a woman went
undercover to nab the people supplying her daughters with drugs
have been sentenced to prison.
   Jimmy Ray Goddard, of Dallas, and Thomas Reed Wilson, of
Independence, each were sentenced Wednesday to 10 years on a charge
of criminal conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine. Goddard was
sentenced an additional five years for possession.
   Goddard, 55, and Wilson, 53, pleaded guilty Feb. 28 in Polk
County Circuit Court to the charges after Pat Morrison, 44, went
undercover and infiltrated what police described as a major
methamphetamine operation.
   Their arrests came after police accompanied Morrison to a state
park west of Salem, where she arranged to sell chemicals to a
suspect.
   Morrison, a bartender, said she decided to get involved because
her daughters, ages 24 and 21, used methamphetamine and had been
reduced to living out of their cars.
   Morrison went on to organize Grandparents for Drug Free America
and has signed a contract for a television movie about her
experience.

<HEAD>Sinhalese Militant Organization Calls Weeklong Cease-Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A militant Sinhalese group blamed for
more than 2,500 killings this year will begin a unilateral
cease-fire, a statement bearing the organization's name said today.
   The cease-fire by the People's Liberation Front is scheduled to
last one week beginning midnight Friday, coinciding with the
Sinhalese Vesak festival that commemorates the birth, enlightenment
and death of Buddha.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 16
million and are predominantly Buddhist.
   The ultranationalist organization claims a government peace
accord gave too many concessions to Tamils, a mainly Hindu minority
seeking autonomy in the northern and eastern areas of this island
nation. It also claims the presence of Indian troops, sent to
enforce the accord, undermines Sri Lanka's sovereignty.
   The Sinhalese-language statement, delivered to newspaper and
news agency offices, said its followers will defend themselves if
attacked but will not initiate any confrontations.
   A Sri Lankan military spokesman declined comment on the
cease-fire statement. ``There was no official communication,'' the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The government has blamed the front for the deaths of more than
3,500 people, mostly of Sinhalese government workers, officials and
police informers, since the peace agreement was signed in July 1987.
   Tamil militants initially supported the accord that gave them
some autonomy, but they later reneged and refused to hand over
arms. They have since waged a protracted guerrilla war with Indian
troops. The militants launched their bloody insurgency in 1983.
   India became involved because of the sympathies of its 60
million politically powerful Tamils in south India for their fellow
Tamils in Sri Lanka, who make up 17 percent of the island's
population.
   More than 12,500 people have been killed in Sri Lanka since the
ethnic warfare began nationwide in 1983.
   In April, President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government offered
Sinhalese and Tamil militants a peace package that included seats
in Parliament and employment. Tamil guerrillas opened talks with
the government, but the Sinhalese extremists did not accept the
offer.

   Here are excerpts from the 18-point
Chinese-Soviet joint communique issued after Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to China. The English-language version
was provided by the official Xinhua News Agency.
   _The two sides agreed that the Sino-Soviet high-level meeting
symbolized the normalization of relations between the two
countries. This is in conformity with the interests and aspirations
of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and contributes to the
maintenance of world peace and stability. The normalization of
Sino-Soviet relations is not directed at any third country, nor
does it harm its interests.
   _(China and the Soviet Union) had an overall and in-depth
exchange of views on the settlement of the Kampuchean (Cambodian)
question.
   They shared the concern and considered it essential that no
civil war in Kampuchea should follow the complete Vietnamese troop
withdrawal and that future Kampuchea should be an independent,
peaceful, neutral and non-aligned state. To this end, they
expressed support for national reconciliation with the
participation of the four parties in Kampuchea.
   The Chinese side advocated the establishment in Kampuchea of a
provisional quadripartite coalition government headed by (Cambodian
resistance leader) Prince Sihanouk during the transitional period
after the complete Vietnamese troop withdrawal and prior to the end
of a general election.
   The Soviet side maintained that the internal problems of
Kampuchea, including preparations for the general election under
international supervision, should be solved by the Kampuchean
people themselves.
   They held that with the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from
Kampuchea, the countries concerned should gradually reduce and
eventually stop all their military aid to any of the parties in
Kampuchea.
   _The two sides agreed to take measures to cut down the military
forces in the area along the Sino-Soviet boundary to a minimum
level commensurate with the normal, good-neighborly relations
between the two countries.
   _The two sides favored a fair and reasonable settlement of the
Sino-Soviet boundary question.
   _The two sides agreed that the Communist Party of China and the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union would develop their contacts
and exchanges in accordance with the principles of independence,
complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
   _The two sides stated that neither side would seek hegemony of
any form in the Asian-Pacific region or other parts of the world.
Both deemed it essential to denounce the attempt or action of any
country to impose its will on others or seek hegemony of any form
anywhere in the world.

   An official of the National Security Council
says the Bush administration may seek renewed military aid to the
Contra rebels if Nicaragua's Sandinista government holds power by
fraudulent means in next year's election.
   ``If it is perceived that they have stolen the election, then
our policy subsequently will reflect that,'' NSC counselor Peter
Rodman said Wednesday to the privately financed Commission on Free
and Fair Elections in Nicaragua.
   ``The wider this perception, then the stronger consensus there
will be for an appropriate policy afterward,'' Rodman said.
   The official was asked his reaction to the testimony of Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who told the commission on
Tuesday he would favor ``significant military aid'' to the
U.S.-backed Contras if Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega fails to
hold free elections as promised.
   ``I have nothing to add to what was part of the bipartisan
accord a couple of months ago, that the administration does reserve
the right to ask for such aid in the future if circumstances
change,'' he said.
   ``That's not part of our present policy, but the administration
has not given away its future right to ask for such things if it
seems appropriate,'' he added.
   The United States government provides non-lethal aid to the
Contra rebels in their fight to oust the Marxist-led Nicaraguan
government. Military aid was cut off last year.
   Asked by former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., commission
co-chairman, what U.S. policy would be if a fair election resulted
in an Ortega victory, Rodman replied, ``I hesitate to prejudge
everything we would do. I think there is a presumption that if
there is a fair election and we accept it as a fair election, that
makes a big difference in our attitude toward Nicaragua and
certainly our policy.''
   The commission, established by the conservative World Freedom
Foundation, is made up of three Democrats and three Republicans.
   Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment for
Democracy, a private grant-making organization that receives an
appropriation from Congress, testified that the Nicaraguan election
process ``will not work, and indeed will be a farce, if there is
not concerted effort by the Central American presidents and by
others who are concerned about the situation to insist upon fair
rules.''
   ``So far, the fear is that there have been certain cosmetic
steps that have been taken, perhaps to improve the standing of the
government in Europe and elsewhere, but that there has not been any
real effort to sit down and establish an agreement,'' Gershman
said. ``Unless there is agreement on rules, it will undermine the
legitimacy of the whole process.''
   Elections are to be held in Nicaragua next February under a
regional peace plan that Managua made with the neighboring
governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
   Paul S. Reichler of Washington, an attorney for the Nicaraguan
government who said he was speaking only for himself, said he
believes the Sandinistas will win the election. If they do not, he
said he believes they will turn over power to whoever does.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today ended a summit that
broke down the barriers of 30 years of hostility between the Soviet
Union and China and was further dramatized by huge pro-democracy
protests.
   The Soviet leader and his wife, Raisa, left Shanghai to end what
Gorbachev called a visit of ``epoch-making significance.'' The
Soviet news agency Tass quoted Gorbachev as calling the summit ``a
watershed event.''
   A joint communique said ``neither side would seek hegemony of
any form'' in any part of the world. China has long accused Moscow
of trying to dominate weaker nations.
   The communique, issued after Gorbachev left, said normalization
of relations ``contributes to the maintenance of world peace and
stability.''
   It contained a lengthy section on Cambodia, with the two sides
expressing different opinions on the conflict that has been the
main obstacle to improved Sino-Soviet ties.
   China repeated its support for a provisional government led by
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and including both the
three-party resistance and the Vietnam-backed Hun Sen faction.
   The Soviet Union, which supports Vietnam in its 10-year war with
the China-backed resistance, said only that internal problems,
including preparation for general elections under international
supervision, should be solved by the Cambodians.
   The two sides agreed that with Vietnam's withdrawal, slated for
September, civil war should be avoided and outside parties should
gradually end military aid to the warring factions.
   The communique said the two sides agreed to take measures to cut
down troops along their border ``to a minimum level commensurate
with the normal, good neighborly relations between the two
countries.''
   During the visit, Gorbachev called for demilitarization of the
countries' border, now guarded by 600,000 Soviet and 1 million
Chinese troops. The countries fought a brief war along the border
in 1969. He also suggested regular military consultations such as
the Soviet Union has with the United States.
   The communique upgraded talks on territorial disputes to the
foreign minister level.
   It made clear that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations
``is not directed at any third country.'' The United States in the
past has benefited strategically from the Sino-Soviet rift, but it
has welcomed their rapprochement as contributing to regional and
world stability.
   The summit was the first meeting of Chinese and Soviet leaders
since a hostile encounter between Mao Tse-tung and Nikita
Khrushchev in 1959.
   Gorbachev's five-hour trip to Shanghai today was a respite from
official meetings and from scheduled events that repeatedly were
disrupted by demonstrators demanding political reform.
   In Shanghai, Gorbachev met with Communist Party chief Jiang
Zemin and Mayor Zhu Rongji and laid a wreath at a monument to the
Russian poet Alexander Pushkin.
   He also toured the Minhang Special Economic Zone, one of China's
areas set aside for foreign investment. The Soviet Union is trying
to set up similar areas as it embarks on economic reform.
   As Gorbachev left Beijing, crowds of factory workers, government
officials and students streamed into the city center in a show of
support for students on a hunger strike for democracy. On
Wednesday, more than 1 million protesters marched through Beijing's
Tiananmen Square to show support for the pro-democracy campaign.
   Thousands also took to the streets of Shanghai and at least 20
other cities to support the students.
   Gorbachev, whom student protesters have praised for the
political reforms he has championed at home, on Wednesday said that
a ``difficult, painful but political dialogue is going on between
the leadership, the youth and the public concerning these events,
and it seems to me that we should welcome that fact.''
   China's leaders have over the past decade introduced free-market
reforms that have stimulated the economy but have resisted
political liberalization of the sort Gorbachev has encouraged in
the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet leader said he had received ``a very warm letter''
from students that endorsed his reforms, which have included the
country's first contested elections in 71 years. He had received a
petition signed by 6,000 students.
   Some have been fasting since Saturday in the latest tactic of a
monthlong campaign to press the government for reforms including
press freedom and a crackdown on official corruption.
   At his Wednesday news conference, Gorbachev defended socialist
countries experiencing unrest as they attempt to make reforms.
   ``If anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history,
I think they will be disappointed again,'' he said.
   Earlier, in a nationally televised interview, Gorbachev said his
summit with Chinese leaders went well.

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, leader of the
1968 Prague Spring reforms, was among dozens of well wishers who
visited playwright Vaclav Havel after he was released from jail.
   At a party today attended by at least 100 supporters, Havel said
he had a ``very interesting'' three-hour talk with Dubcek after he
was released on probation Wednesday. It was the first time the two
had met in 20 years.
   Dubcek was accompanied by Vaclav Slavik, a former leader who was
expelled from the party in a purge carried out by the current party
leader, Milos Jakes, after the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed
Dubcek's reforms in 1968.
   Havel declined to give more details about his conversation with
Dubcek.
   Havel, whose works are banned in Czechoslovakia, was arrested
Jan. 16 at an unofficial memorial ceremony in Prague's Wenceslas
Square for Jan Palach, a student who committed suicide by setting
himself on fire in January 1969 to protest the crushing of reforms.
   Havel was sentenced on Feb. 22 to nine months in jail on charges
of incitement and obstructing a police officer. An appeals court
dropped the obstruction charge in March and reduced the sentence to
eight months. Havel was put on 18 months' probation upon his
release.
   For Dubcek, now a pensioner living in the Slovak capital of
Bratislava, the meeting with Havel marked the second time in three
days that he had met with opposition activists he once declined to
see in public. Dubcek was among 1,000 mourners who attended the
funeral Monday in Slovakia of opposition writer Dominik Tatarka,
who died last week, according to others who attended.
   Dubcek was ousted as party leader in April 1969 and expelled
from the party in June 1970 after a brief period as Czechoslovak
ambassador to Turkey.
   Authorities watched him closely for almost 17 years, but his
police guard was removed after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
visited Czechoslovakia in April 1987. Since then, Dubcek has
cautiously resumed political activity and was allowed to visit
Italy late last year.
   In a recent interview with Hungarian television, he condemned
the current Prague leadership for abandoning his reforms.

   Ronald Reagan's humor and defense of freedom
were compared to those of Winston Churchill as the former president
received an award named for Britain's great wartime leader.
   ``I think I would put personal charm at the top of the list'' of
common denominators between the two men, Britain's Prince Philip
said Wednesday night.
   Before placing the silver medallion around Reagan's neck,
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, said the award was offered ``in
admiration of your outstanding gift of leadership, which helped the
nation to regain its confidence, vigor and sense of purpose and to
recapture the respect of foreign friends and adversary alike.''
   The black-tie ceremony was held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel,
with comedian Bob Hope as master of ceremonies.
   ``This is an informal evening,'' Hope quipped at one point.
``The prince decided not to wear a crown. So did the Reagans.''
   Reagan, 78, said he was humbled by the award. ``Winston
Churchill inspired us all. He was truly a great man. Few will ever
be his equal. He seemed to instinctively understand man, government
and the importance of freedom.''
   The award is given from time to time to individuals of
exceptional accomplishment who exemplify the values and standards
associated with Churchill. Reagan is the fourth recipient; past
winners are statesman W. Averell Harriman, executive H. Ross Perot
and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of protesters
beating drums and chanting slogans marched today on the anniversary
of a bloody 1980 uprising to demand the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo.
   About 60,000 students, townspeople and opposition supporters
gathered in southeastern Kwangju to denounce Roh and the United
States for suppressing the 1980 Kwangju rebellion in which at least
192 people died.
   Eight effigies representing Roh and seven other senior generals
who commanded the army were burned as the crowd cheered and raised
clinched fists in the provincial capital, 170 miles southwest of
Seoul.
   In Seoul and seven other cities, thousands of people also took
part in marches, protests and religious services.
   Thousands of riot police were deployed in central Seoul to block
protests. Police chased bands of students who ran through the
streets shouting slogans, such as ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and
``Drive out the Yankee imperialists!''
   In Kwangju, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said right-wing
forces were plotting to reimpose authoritarian rule in South Korea.
``We must remain alert to crush them and inherit the spirit of
Kwangju,'' Kim said in the message read to the crowd.
   All protests were peaceful except in southern Chonju where
radical students hurling firebombs attacked offices of the
governing Democratic Justice Party. Police said there were no
injuries.
   Dissident groups had called for peaceful protests to mark the
anniversary of the uprising that began May 18, 1980 in Kwangju.
Past anniversaries were marked by violence.
   It was the first time the government permitted a demonstration
in Kwangju to mark the uprising. Hundreds of riot police stayed out
of sight inside the government headquarters while the huge crowd
demonstrated in the square before the government building.
   Earlier, 20,000 people visited the cemetery outside Kwangju
where many of those killed in the nine-day uprising are buried.
Mourners prayed and bowed before the graves as funeral music blared
over loud speakers and students pounded drums.
   Mourners lit a gasoline-drenched figure made of cloth about six
feet high, with a top hat decorated with the U.S. Stars and Stripes
and Roh's face.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Get out American imperialists!''
people yelled as thick smoke swirled up from the blazing effigy.
   Dissident groups called for Roh's resignation and the expulsion
of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea. They claim
Washington has helped to keep Roh and past authoritarian
governments in power.
   Crowds of students, townspeople, opposition politicians and
others hiked to the cemetery in the hills outside Kwangju. Elderly
mothers, dressed in long traditional white mourning robes, sobbed
and cried hysterically in front of the graves of sons killed in the
uprising.
   ``My son, my son!'' sobbed one woman.
   Other mourners placed fruit and drinks on the graves and burned
scented candles to honor the dead. Pictures of the dead, mostly
young students, were placed in front of many of the graves.
   Columns of radical students carried red, blue and yellow flags.
Banners depicted enraged people with rifles fighting soldiers.
   Anti-government sentiment in Kwangju, a traditional opposition
stronghold, has been inflamed by the death earlier this month of a
radical student. Dissidents allege police killed Lee Chol-kyu,
whose body was found in a reservoir near Kwangju May 10.
   Roh was a senior army general when townspeople and students
seized a government armory in Kwangju on May 18, 1980 and took
control of the city until troops were sent in to end the uprising.
   Government reports said 192 people were killed and hundreds
injured. Opposition groups claim the government covered up many
more deaths.
   South Korea has been hit by waves of violent anti-government
protests and labor strikes in recent months. Dissidents and radical
students have been calling for the overthrow of the Roh government,
but they lack public support because of their violent tactics and
extremist views.

   The mayor has apologized for saying
he feared a transfusion of ``monkey blood'' during a planned trip
to Zaire, but said the flap has given him ``international status.''
   Mayor Carl E. Officer, who is black, said on May 3 that he would
bring his own supply of blood in case he needs a transfusion. He
said he feared receiving contaminated ``monkey blood'' from
Africans.
   On Wednesday, Officer called his remarks ``unfortunate and
uncalled for.''
   ``I have grievously erred,'' he said.
   Officer said he has received numerous complaints about his
remarks from Zairians living in this country ``and from persons in
all walks of life who are of African ancestry.''
   The mayor issued a formal, written apology ``to all African
people and to all natives of the United States of African descent.''
   ``I am truly sorry for offending persons for whom I hold so much
love and respect,'' the statement said.
   On Tuesday, Glenwood Roane, executive director of the
Zaire-American Research Institutute, which is a sponsor of the
trip, called Officer's remarks ``ignorant'' and said the mayor
``should consider himself uninvited.''
   But Officer said he has ``every intention'' of making the
two-week trip starting June 19 with 40 other mayors.
   Officer said he planned to be more careful about his public
comments.
   The controversy has ``elevated me from a local status to an
international status,'' he said. ``So as an international leader
now, I'm much more concerned about my status and my comments.''

   The U.S. attorney's office in New York is
investigating Mayor Tom Bradley's ties to brokerage firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert and indicted financier Michael Milken, newspapers
reported today.
   The probe apparently is not directed specifically at the
embattled mayor but is part of a larger investigation into
politicians' links to Drexel and its former junk bond chief,
Milken, the Los Angeles Times and Herald Examiner reported in
today's editions.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has subpoenaed records
of Bradley's dealings with Drexel as part of a probe into the firm
and Milken, who is charged with 96 counts of insider trading,
racketeering and securities fraud, the Times reported.
   The U.S. attorney's office also directed Los Angeles FBI agents
to interview a former top financial adviser to Bradley about the
mayor's ties to Drexel and Milken, the Herald Examiner reported.
   Bradley declined to comment Wednesday on the reports of the
latest investigation. In the past, he has acknowledged he made
errors in judgment in some of his private finances but has denied
any wrongdoing.
   ``Basically, they (FBI agents) asked me if I thought that the
mayor was capable of insider trading and if I knew of any evidence
of financial impropriety or if he got any stock tips,'' said Mark
Ross Weinberg, a former commodities broker.
   Weinberg, who said he advised Bradley from April 1983 to early
1985, told agents he never gave Bradley inside stock tips. ``I
don't believe Tom Bradley has a crooked bone in his body,''
Weinberg said he told the agents.
   The U.S. attorney would be at least the fifth authority
investigating the mayor, joining the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the city attorney, the City Council and the Fair
Political Practices Commission, a state watchdog group.
   Bradley has been dogged by accusations of conflict of interest
since his re-election last month to an unprecedented fifth term as
mayor of the nation's second-largest city.
   Allegations of conflict of interest surfaced when published
reports revealed the mayor was paid by two banks that were doing
business with the city. Since then, additional questions have been
raised about the mayor's stock deals.
   The Beverly Hills-based Milken is a major campaign donor and
fund-raiser for Bradley, who has lobbied to keep Drexel's junk bond
operations in Beverly Hills throughout the federal investigation of
Drexel and Milken.

   Ms. Frerichs is blind. Lyric is her seeing-eye dog.
   Collegiate Cap &amp; Gown Co. of Champaign designed the special

long lectures and study sessions.
   ``It was such a nice thing for them to do,'' said Ms. Frerichs,

``I'm not sure I could have done it emotionally without her.''

to graduation.
   ``Most of them go kind of psychotic,'' he said. ``They get
stepped on and they get tired. And after a while, the students
leave them at home and just start using a cane.''
   But Lyric hung in there and even proved to be a help to other
students by keeping classes from running over.
   When the class bell rang, Ms. Frerichs said, Lyric got up, ready
to head out the door.

<TEXT>
   President Bush promises to veto ``faster than
the eye can see'' a raise in the minimum wage and Republican
lawmakers are justifiably confident Bush will win his first
domestic-policy clash with Capitol Hill's majority Democrats.
   ``There are enough votes in the Senate to support a presidential
veto,'' Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said Wednesday before the
Senate gave 63-37 approval to legislation increasing the minimum
wage for the first time in eight years.
   Dole's prediction was borne out moments later _ the final vote
was four votes short of the margin that would be required to enact
the bill over a Bush veto.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole joined her husband in accusing
Democrats of picking a political fight with Bush instead of
accepting the president's proposal and assuring nearly 4 million
minimum-wage workers a pay raise.
   ``Congress just frittered away another, and the last chance to
increase the minimum wage this year,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``The
president will be forced to veto their unacceptable package and
everyone loses.''
   Democrats pushing the measure vowed nonetheless to press their
case with the president and, while refusing to concede defeat in
advance, said they would advance another bill if Bush's first veto
is sustained.
   ``We want to make it very clear this fight is not going to go
away and we are going to continue the battle until we get a fair
and justified increase in the minimum wage,'' Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., said after the vote.
   Moments later, Bush, who before the vote had said a veto was
``going to be inevitable,'' made clear he meant it.
   When the bill reaches the White House, Bush will veto it
``instantly faster than the eye can see,'' presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The president apparently won't get that chance until after
Congress returns from a 10-day recess that begins Friday.
   The Democratic leadership does not want to send the bill to the
White House immediately, which would allow Bush to veto it while
most members of Congress are away from Washington. The delay also
will allow time for what the Democrats hope will emerge _
widespread public opposition to Bush's position.
   The showdown over the minimum wage has been looming since
Congress convened in January and has taken on symbolic significance
as the determinant in whether congressional Democrats or Bush will
hold the upper hand in setting domestic policy.
   Democrats have seemed as eager as Bush for the confrontation,
but Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, insisted
Wednesday that the minimum wage was the wrong issue for that fight.
   ``He really isn't standing up to Congress, he's standing on the
necks and backs of the working poor of this country,'' Mitchell
said. ``The president has a perceived political need to look tough,
to veto a bill. We hope the American people will persuade him this
is not the issue.''
   The 63-37 Senate vote approved a plan to boost the hourly
minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991. It also
would allow employers to pay a subminimum wage to workers with less
than 60 days total work experience.
   Bush, following through on a campaign promise, had proposed
raising the floor wage to $4.25 by January 1992 but only if
employers could pay a subminimum to all new employees for six
months regardless of their prior work experience. The president has
said that provision is necessary to offset potential job losses,
but Democrats have assailed it as a means of allowing employers to
avoid paying the higher minimum wage.
   Even though it appears Bush will win the veto battle, just
getting a minimum-wage bill out of Congress was a symbolic victory
for its sponsors, who for the past eight years could not move their
proposal even that far because of then-President Reagan's vehement
opposition.

   In a new crackdown, the army will require
residents of the occupied Gaza Strip to have special permits to
enter Israel and may extend the restrictions to Palestinians in the
West Bank, a military official said today.
   The unprecedented measure _ affecting 700,000 people _ came a
day after Parliament approved Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace
plan calling for elections in the occupied lands to choose
Palestinian delegates for autonomy talks with Israel.
   Also today, an 18-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank
refugee camp of Dheishe died eight days after being shot in the
head during a clash with troops, the army said. Arab hospital
officials identified him as Ali Zghari.
   The death brought to 482 the number of Palestinians killed since
the December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation. Twenty-one Israelis have also been slain.
   At least 14 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with
soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip today, Arab reports and
hospital officials said.
   One was a 13-year-old boy listed in critical condition in
Tulkarem Hospital with a wound in the chest. He was shot at the
West Bank's Tulkarem Refugee Camp, where soldiers fired on youths
defying a curfew in effect for five days, according to Arab reports.
   Much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip were shut down by a general
strike called by the Moslem fundamentalist movement ``Hamas,'' or
zeal, to protest Israeli interference with mosques.
   The army, which imposed a general curfew on the Gaza Strip on
Monday, lifted the restrictions in Gaza City and several other
areas today but continued to bar all Gazans from entering Israel.
On Tuesday, authorities forced all Gazans still in Israel to return
to their homes.
   The closure and the permit requirements are part of a new army
crackdown on the uprising. In the West Bank, home to 1 million
Palestinians, troops have resumed arrest raids in isolated Arab
villages, a practice that led to many casualties and was abandoned
for several months.
   The new permits ``will improve our ability of supervising the
entry of Palestinians from the occupied territories to Israel,''
said the military official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated that Palestinians
active in the uprising would be denied permits.
   ``We distinguish between those Palestinians who would like to
continue their lives in a normal way regardless of what political
views or political aspirations they may have and those who
participate in violence,'' he told the Jerusalem Post newspaper.
   Rabin said the peace initiative and crackdown were part of the
same policy. The Palestine Liberation Organization and many
prominent Palestinians in the occupied territories have rejected
Shamir's peace plan because it does not provide for eventual
Palestinian statehood.
   Rabin said the new restrictions were meant ``to send a clear
message to the Palestinians: Forget about bringing about any
changes in the political initiative through stones or firebombs.''
   The military official said Palestinians convicted of serious
crimes, such as murder or armed robbery, would also be barred from
Israel but that details were still being worked out.
   Officials said 28,000 Palestinians have been convicted of crimes
in Israel in the past 10 years.
   Rabin said the army could start issuing permits by the end of
May, and expected the process to be completed within three months.
   It was not immediately clear whether Gazans would be confined to
the Gaza Strip until all permits have been issued.
   The closure will have the strongest affect on the 50,000 Gazans
who work in Israel and whose low-paying jobs in farming,
construction and municipal services are their only source of
income. About 60,000 West Bank Palestinians also work in Israel.
   In the past few days, officials in several Israeli cities have
debated proposals to fire workers from the occupied lands and hire
unemployed Israelis for higher wages.
   Tel Aviv Mayor Shlomo Lahat said today that only companies whose
employees are Israeli citizens will get contracts for street
cleaning. Currently, most Tel Aviv street cleaners are Gaza Strip
residents.
   ``To take the residents from the territories, and give them the
work we, the Israelis, don't want to do is unethical, unhealthy,''
Lahat said on Israel radio.

<HEAD>Doctors Hope Facial Surgery Will Speed Jogger's Neurological Recovery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors performed surgery to repair broken bones
around the eye of a jogger who was raped and beaten in Central Park
and hoped it would clear up the woman's double vision and aid her
neurological recovery.
   A team of seven surgeons worked Wednesday to repair fractured
bones around the woman's left eye socket, said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz,
director of the surgical intensive care unit at Metropolitan
Hospital.
   The 28-year-old woman even joked about the surgery, Kurtz said.
   He said a neurologist asked the woman, ``What part of the body
do I work on?'' and the woman replied, ``The main course.''
   The woman, an investment banker, was attacked by a group of
teen-age boys as she jogged through the park on the night of April
19. She was comatose for nearly two weeks, but has made slow
progress since emerging from the coma, including being able to name
objects and helping to move herself from a stretcher to a bed.
   The woman's left eye had been pushed out of place when its bony
supports were fractured. Kurtz said doctors put the ends of
fractured bones together and used a small piece of bone from her
skull to move the eye back to its normal position.
   Doctors hoped the operation will ease her disorientation. But
Kurtz said the woman continued to have brain-function problems and
remained in serious condition.

   The manager of the only tire repair
shop in town was charged after at least 14 cars and trucks had
their tires punctured, officials said.
   Donald Ellison, 28, manager of the Fayette Tire Shop, was
arrested Wednesday and charged with 14 counts of conspiracy to
destroy property in Saturday morning's spree, police said. A
teen-age boy was charged with destruction of property and
conspiracy.
   ``Everyone was pretty well mad Saturday morning,'' said Greg
Ayres, who had two tires punctured each on his van and car. ``It
was quite a sight to look down the parking lot and see all the cars
sitting on a slant.
   ``Most everybody went down there (to Ellison's shop),'' Ayres
said. ``It was the closest place around.'' The vandalized cars and
trucks were parked in an apartment parking lot and on several
streets in this town of 1,800.
   Also charged Wednesday was Shawn Smith, 18, of Mount Hope,
police said. Smith faces 14 counts of destruction of property and
one count of conspiracy to destroy property, said Police Chief
Garland Burke.
   The charges were filed after Smith turned himself in to the
Fayette County Sheriff's Department about 1 a.m. Wednesday, Burke
said. Police arrested Ellison at his home about seven hours later,
the chief said.
   Both suspects were arraigned before a magistrate and was
released on $5,000 bond, Burke said.
   Burke said Ellison was charged with conspiracy but not with
actually damaging the tires because police didn't have evidence
that he did the puncturing. He said he couldn't comment on how
Ellison was linked to the incident.

   Desperate and depressed people
reaching out for help from a national suicide prevention hotline
have been instead dialing the number of a wholesale craft supply
business.
   The calls are fraying the tempers of LaVon Davis and her two
employees at House of France.
   ``It's very draining,'' she said of trying to handle suicidal
callers. ``I don't know if it's because of the calls but we're all
kind of on edge with each other ... rather irritable.''
   The calls apparently result from a mixup in which a national
suicide prevention hotline somehow published the number for Davis'
business.
   ``We got a call today from a man who said he saw the number on
channel 32 in Miami,'' Davis said Wednesday. There is no commercial
channel 32 in Miami although the number is used by various cable
companies.
   ``We told him we would try to get help for him,'' Davis said.
   The calls began about four weeks ago. Suicide prevention
agencies in the Grand Rapids area have given Davis their numbers to
pass along to callers.
   Davis said changing her business number is unfeasible because of
the potential of losing sales.
   ``I just hope that nobody does anything in the meantime,'' she
said. ``I guess it's on all of our consciences, every time the
phone rings.''

<HEAD>Aerospace Company Charged With Selling Substandard Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has indicted a
California aerospace company on charges of selling substandard and
defective bolts to NASA for use on the space shuttle.
   The indictment Wednesday accuses Lee Aerospace Products Inc. of
Simi Valley, Calif., of defrauding the government by stating that
the bolts were tested and met national aerospace standards.
   The bolts were sold from August 1985 to September 1987 to USBI
Production Company Inc. at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which
used them in the assembly and refurbishing of solid rocket boosters
on the space shuttle.
   The indictment charges Lee Aerospace President Darrell Lee and
Vice President Jerry Martin with 34 counts of fraud and filing
false statements on a government contract.
   If convicted on each count, Lee and Martin could face up to 170
years in prison and $8.5 million in fines. The corporation faces up
to $17 million in fines and the possible loss of further government
contracts.
   The investigation into the aerospace company was disclosed in
September after the bolts had been installed on the shuttle
Discovery. NASA engineers said the bolts were not used in critical
points on the shuttle and were not an immediate threat to flight
safety.
   Most of the bolts anchored non-critical items such as cables and
electrical boxes. The boosters are held together by pins and the
bolts are used to attach components to the boosters. There are also
numerous backup bolts if any of the bolts fail.
   The two boosters used on Discovery had 1,209 bolts manufactured
by Lee, about 60 percent of the 2,000 bolts installed on the
rockets.
   Analysis conducted last year at NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., found that 15 percent of the Lee bolts
sold to NASA did not meet required specifications. Bolts certified
to withstand 17,000 pounds of pressure per square inch failed at
15,000 pounds per square inch, according to NASA officials.
   It is not clear if Lee Aerospace manufactured or simply acted as
a broker on the bolts in question.
   An employee who answered the phone at Lee Aerospace Wednesday
said Lee and Martin were unavailable for comment. The two are
expected to be summoned before a U.S. magistrate in Orlando within
the next few weeks.

<HEAD>Moderates Gain In Northern Ireland Election, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with gains by moderates reported. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts cautiously predicted
gains for moderates on both sides of the Protestant-Catholic divide
today in Northern Ireland's local election.
   With returns in from 23 of the 98 wards, a BBC-TV computer
projection showed Sinn Fein, backer of the Irish Republican Army,
losing ground to the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which
opposes violence.
   The BBC forecast 109 local council seats for the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, up 8 from the 1985 election, and 57 for
Sinn Fein, down 2. It forecast 20.2 percent of the vote for the
Social Democratic and Labor Party, up from 17.8 percent, and 12.1
percent for Sinn Fein, up from 11.8 percent.
   In the Protestant camp the BBC forecast 197 seats for the more
moderate Ulster Unionist Party, up 7, and 109 for hard-line Rev.
Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, down 33.
   It gave the Ulster Unionist Party, also known as the ``official
unionists,'' 29.8 percent, unchanged from 1985, and the Democratic
Unionists 20.1 percent, down from 24.3 percent.
   Altogether 566 seats were at stake on 26 councils, although a
few wards have postponed elections for a few days due to the death
of candidates.
   Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2 in Northern Ireland, and no
significant change in the control of councils is expected.
   Seventeen of the outgoing councils are now controlled by
Protestants, and the rest by Catholics.
   Sinn Fein's vote looked solid in its Belfast and Londonderry
strongholds but down in some rural areas.
   Recent bungled IRA attacks which have claimed innocent lives may
have been a factor. In Enniskillen, where a misfired IRA bomb
killed 11 Protestants in November 1987, Sinn Fein local leader Paul
Corrigan's vote fell from 2,360 to 1,781 _ a heavy setback in a
sparsely populated rural district.
   Sinn Fein saw its traditionally strong support in Strabane
falling 5.2 percent, and in Cookstown it was down 4.3 percent,
according to early results. The Social Democratic and Labor Party
was seen gaining about 2 percent in each district.
   Sinn Fein insisted the IRA blunders were not a campaign issue
and blamed its losses on voter apathy. It also blamed a government
ban imposed last year on broadcast interviews with its members.
   The ban, which the government said was necessary to fight
terrorism, was waived during the latest election campaign and
reimposed immediately after polling stations closed Wednesday night.
   Analyzing the early Sinn Fein returns, commentator Colin
MacIlhenny said on Radio Ulster: ``In the really hard-core areas
... their vote is holding up. In parts where they're in direct
competition with the SDLP ... their vote has crumbled.''
   Tom Kelly, Radio Ulster's political correspondent, said: ``There
does seem to be a trend of the SDLP gaining at the expense of Sinn
Fein, but also of Sinn Fein voters perhaps staying at home.''
   Analyst Paul Arthur said on Ulster TV that it was too early to
draw conclusions.
   A gain for the Social Democratic and Labor Party would be taken
by the British and Irish governments as vindicating the accord they
signed in 1985, which gives Dublin a say in the running of the
province.
   The accord aims to woo Irish nationalists to the non-violent
Social Democratic and Labor Party and undercut Sinn Fein and the
IRA, which is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.
   No overall turnout figure was available. The final result is
expected late Friday.
   One striking result was Laurence Kennedy's victory in the
affluent Protestant ward of Holywood, near Belfast.
   Kennedy ran as a Conservative in a campaign to persuade Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party to enter Northern
Ireland politics.
   British parties have always preferred an arm's-length
relationship with Northern Ireland, giving the province limited
self-rule and its own parties.
   Activists like Kennedy say this perpetuated a sectarian divide
instead of creating normal left-right politics and that the mold
can only be broken by mainland parties entering the fray.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government newspaper today
claimed the United States bribed the Organization of American
States to pass a resolution calling for a transfer of power in
Panama.
   Panama's de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, said in a
radio interview that Washington's desire to get rid of him is
racially motivated.
   He also accused the U.S. Embassy in Panama of misinforming
President Bush about the situation in Panama since the May 7
presidential election. Foreign observers say the opposition won the
vote, but the government declared the election void.
   ``Panama asks for respect. It asks for freedom. For its
sovereignty. The time of empires has ended. Why does the United
States want an empire in Panama? Why? This is our only answer:
because we are black,'' the general told WBAI radio in New York in
a telephone interview from Panama.
   His comments, on WBAI's ``Undercurrents'' program, came after
the OAS unanimously approved a resolution Wednesday night to send
mediators to Panama in an effort to bring about a transfer of power
through democratic means.
   ``The United States must change its attitude here in Panama.
This is my message to your small radio station,'' Noriega said.
   The government newspaper La Critica contended that the United
States promised to pay its debt to the OAS of $50 million in
exchange for the passage of the resolution.
   It did not mention that Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Ritter,
supported sending in foreign ministers.
   A commentator on the government's Radio Nacional said if the
foreign ministers visit Panama, ``they must not come with the
proposal that Noriega leave because that is an internal Panamanian
affair.''
   The commentator, Rigoberto Paredes, said the ministers should
come to discuss ``the war of aggression the United States is waging
against us,'' and the freeing of Panamanian funds frozen in
American banks last year.
   Paredes is an influential member of Panama's National Assembly
and the former secretary-general of the military-run Revolutionary
Democratic Party.
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since he was
indicted last year in Florida on federal drug-trafficking charges.
Noriega denies the allegations and contends the United States wants
him out so it can renege on the Panama Canal treaties, which call
for control of the waterway to be turned over to Panama by 2000.
   As head of the Defense Forces, Noriega also is the de facto
ruler of Panama.
   The opposition called a general strike Wednesday to press for
his ouster, but merchants say fear, frustration and economic
hardship caused it to fizzle.
   Half the capital's businesses remained open, taxis and buses
operated normally and the few demonstrations were small.
   Many businesses in Panama are owned by foreigners, and some
owners said they feared problems with the government if they closed.
   ``We were closed for two months last year and we got nothing out
of it. The crisis got worse,'' said the owner of a furniture store
in the capital.
   ``I'm lucky if I make $7 a day. Last year when I closed for four
days I lost my apartment,'' said another merchant. ``I'd close
again if I thought it would make a difference.''
   Leaders of Panama's government-controlled unions condemned the
strike, and taxi drivers said they were told they could lose their
licenses if they did not work.
   ``We are not fighters. We are not going to go out into the
streets and confront the police,'' said a man sipping a soda in a
small grocery store.
   ``Noriega is willing to die here. He'll have to be carried out
of the barracks feet first,'' an opposition supporter said glumly.
   At San Miguelito, a poor section of town, four women banged pots
and tried to set up a barricade.
   ``Where are the men?'' one woman was asked.
   ``Well,'' she answered, ``that's the problem.''
   ``I am not satisfied,'' said second vice presidential opposition
candidate Guillermo Ford. ``I thought people would express their
disatisfaction in a harsher way.''
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara, however,
termed the action a ``total success.''
   Endara and other opposition candidates were severely beaten by
pro-Noriega thugs after the May 7 vote.
   In an interview Wednesday with France's Antenne 2 network,
Noriega alleged that the opposition itself brought about the
beatings by provoking violence.
   ``The police gave their protection to the candidates. I have as
proof that those who were injured were members of the police
forces,'' he said, showing photographs of what apparently were
hospitalized policemen.
   Ford appealed for the OAS to take concrete steps to force
Noriega to recognize the opposition victory.
   ``We just hope that the OAS once and for all becomes what it was
designed to be: a protector of the Latin American democracies and
not just a place to have nice Scotch and champagne,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
today faced the biggest challenge of his 15-year Marxist rule _ the
reported defection of nearly half his army in the third day of an
attempted coup.
   The trouble came from war-weary troops in the north, who have
been fighting rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   After receiving word of the coup attempt, Mengistu cut short a
state visit to East Germany and returned Wednesday night to Addis
Ababa, where loyal soldiers defeated mutinous troops in a battle in
the capital.
   The city was calm today, but troops still guarded most key
government buildings and the international airport remained closed.
   At least two rebellious generals and the defense minister have
been killed in the fighting, but the total number of casualties was
not known.
   Addis Ababa state radio today urged people to return to work.
   Radio broadcasts from Ethiopia's second-largest city, the
northern provincial capital of Asmara, declared the coup a success
and urged the rest of the military to join the revolt.
   Soldiers backing the coup also were supported by secessionist
rebels the troops have been fighting in the province. The
clandestine radio of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
declared today a two-week cease-fire ``to facilitate the successful
outcome'' of the military revolt that began Tuesday.
   Voice of the Eritrean Masses, the rebel radio, said Ethiopia's
2nd Army _ a force of 150,000 men _ has full control of Asmara,
capital of the northernmost province of Eritrea where the rebels
hold three-fourths of the countryside.
   It said the rebels are discussing with army officers in Asmara
``the best ways to intensify the struggle against ... the common
enemy.''
   The rebellious soldiers commandeered a former government radio
station in the city and broadcast in the name of the ``Armed Forces
of Eritrea.''
   They said they ``called on the (rebels) to join hands'' in
ousting Mengistu, but it was not clear whether the rebels and
soldiers had formed an alliance. Such an association would mean the
government had lost control of the province, Ethiopia's only access
to the Red Sea.
   The revolt began Tuesday, just hours after Mengistu and his wife
left for East Berlin. It was put down in the capital in 24 hours.
   Addis Ababa state radio today announced the death of the defense
minister, Maj. Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte Mariam, saying ``one of the
plotters shot him repeatedly'' Tuesday when he refused to join the
coup attempt.
   Two rebellious officers also were killed Tuesday: Maj. Gen.
Merid Negusie, the chief of staff, and the air force commander,
Maj. Gen. Amha Desta.
   There were unconfirmed reports that a third coup leader, Maj.
Gen. Kumalapchew Dejene, the deputy commander of the armed forces
in Eritrea, was hunted down and killed by loyalist soldiers on
Wednesday.
   State radio said another coup plotter was arrested _ Industry
Minister Fanta Belai who used to command the air force.
   Mengistu inherited the 28-year-old northern civil war when he
and a clique of army officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in a
Marxist revolution Sept. 12, 1974. Since then, his biggest ally,
the Soviet Union, has helped build the Ethiopian army into Africa's
biggest and best equipped, though many troops are unwilling
conscripts. They have been fighting 30,000 Eritrean rebels and
20,000 insurgents who want more autonomy in neighboring Tigre
Province.
   Persistent reports of military unrest in Ethiopia cite
war-weariness among field commanders unhappy with the level of
government support they are receiving in waging the war, which is
the oldest in Africa.
   Eritrea is a former Italian colony that was federated with
Ethiopia in 1957 under a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution. Selassie
annexed the territory in 1962.

<TEXT>
   Mary Kay Cosmetics says it has placed a moratorium
on using laboratory animals to verify the safety of its products
while it studies better methods of non-animal product testing.
   The announcement came Wednesday by Mary Kay President Richard C.
Bartlett at an industry workshop at the Johns Hopkins Center for
Alternatives to Animal Testing in Baltimore.
   ``Our research shows that there is a great deal of consumer
concern and confusion about the use of animals for safety testing
for cosmetic toiletries, household products, all the way through
medical research,'' Bartlett said.
   Mary Kay's imposition of a moratorium is part of a trend in the
cosmetics business to develop alternative product safety testing
methods that don't use animals.
   Avon Products Inc. says it has not used animals for testing its
beauty products since mid-March. It has adopted one non-animal
testing procedure suitable for screening several types of Avon
products and is exploring additional replacements.
   In January, Noxell Corp., maker of Noxzema skin creams and Cover
Girl cosmetics, said it was screening many of its cosmetics by
applying them to tissue cultures in laboratory dishes instead of
injecting them into the eyes of rabbits.
   Many small cosmetics companies already shun the use of animals
to test the safety of their products, marketing their line chiefly
to animal lovers.
   Bartlett said he recently became aware of an improved method of
non-animal testing and decided to put a moratorium on his company's
use of animals until the usefulness of the newer tests is verified.
   The new testing method being studied by Mary Kay would replace
laboratory rats and mice with cells in a test tube, a method
developed at the Baltimore center, Bartlett said.
   ``Since 1981, we have actively participated in the development
of alternative testing methods,'' Bartlett said.
   Bartlett said the Dallas-based company may have to hold up the
release of some new products, but the new technology may someday
speed up product development. Mary Kay's products are not sold in
stores but through individual sales agents.

<HEAD>Biologist Rappels Down Office Building In Bid To Save Falcon Egg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state biologist rappelled down the
side of a 23-story office building and endured repeated attacks by
two rare peregrine falcons to retrieve an egg from the birds' nest.
   The egg turned out to be infertile.
   Thomas French, head of the state's endandered species program,
dangled from two ropes Wednesday while a small crowd gathered on
the street hundreds of feet below and the adult birds attacked.
   He reached the 21st floor ledge of Monarch Place where the
endangered predators are raising two other chicks and sent the egg
up to the roof in a can. But after he rushed the egg to his Conway
home in hopes of incubating it, Thomas P. Ricardi, a master
falconer, said it had no embryo inside.
   ``My heart kind of sank,'' Ricardi said.
   State officials said it's not uncommon to find an infertile egg
in young birds' first nest, but they decided to try the rescue
after the egg did not hatch on schedule. The first egg opened
Saturday and the second chick hatched Monday.
   If the egg had been fertile, the chick would have been returned
to the nest.
   The adult birds are the first peregrine falcons to nest in
western Massachusetts in more than 40 years.
   The state raised and released young falcons in Boston and
Amherst in an attempt to restore a breeding population, but the
Springfield falcons found their own way to the downtown office
building last year. The birds easily adapt to tall buildings in
place of cliffs.
   A leg band shows the female was released in Toronto as part of
the Canadian government's falcon restoration efforts, French said.
The male also is banded but officials haven't yet determined his
origin.
   State biologists had to help a pair of Boston falcons incubate
their first eggs two years ago but they were able to use a
long-handled net to retrieve the eggs from a ledge. The net
couldn't be used at Monarch Place, because the high-rise office
building's windows don't open, officials said.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today
sought support from U.S. officials for a controversial Israeli plan
to hold elections among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   Arens met with national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He also was scheduled to explain
details of the plan to Secretary of State James A. Baker III later
in the day. On Friday, he meets with Vice President Dan Quayle and
members of Congress.
   The United States has expressed qualified support for the plan.
   ``We think that the Shamir plan has some potential,'' Baker said
in an interview Wednesday on Worldnet, the television network of
the U.S. Information Agency. ``We think the idea of elections
cannot be seen as an end in and of themselves, (but) that it would
be helpful in moving toward peace,'' he added.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is seeking strong
endorsement for the plan, adopted by his cabinet on Sunday, both to
satisfy hardline critics at home and to enlist support for it among
moderate Arab leaders.
   Shamir will travel to England and Spain to campaign for the
proposal, which the Palestine Liberation Organization has rejected
because it excludes participation by its representatives and would
be held under Israeli occupation.
   The blueprint calls for elections that would pick Palestinians
who would initially negotiate with Israel over self-rule in the
predominantly Arab West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The five-year autonomy period would be followed by negotiations
to determine who should control the lands which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   Shamir won reluctant Israeli parliamentary approval for the plan
Wednesday, but right-wing activists in his own Likud Party and
other parties claimed it would pave the way for creation of a
Palestinian state.
   Arens, speaking in a television interview, said some critics
believe Israel should withstand international pressure to advance
peace proposals until it has quelled the violent Palestinian
uprising in the territories.
   In response to escalating attacks on Israelis and growing public
pressure, the Israeli government this week cracked down on
Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, preventing them from traveling to
work in Israel and confining them to their homes. More than 480
Palestinians have died in the uprising which began 17 months ago.
   If the violence is to stop, Arens said, the United States must
help secure support for the Israeli election plan among Arab
leaders. ``The United States has a very crucial role to play at
this stage,'' Arens said in the televised interview.
   Arens also said that ``the most important thing as far as we're
concerned is that nothing be done in order to strengthen the image
of the terrorists, of the PLO, because they will try to sabotage
the initiative.''
   Israel objects strongly to the contacts launched last year
between Washington and the PLO, contending they only serve to
derail prospects for peace. Arens is expected to point to the PLO's
rejection of the Israeli plan as proof the organization does not
want peace.

   King Hussein today rejected an Israeli plan
for elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
saying it was an attempt to buy time.
   The Israeli blueprint avoids ``facing increasing world pressures
to solve the (Palestinian) problem in a just and durable way,''
Hussein said.
   Earlier this week, the Palestine Liberation Organization
leadership also rejected the plan, which excludes participation by
PLO members. In a statement issued in Tunisia earlier this week,
the PLO leaders said they would not support elections under Israeli
occupation.
   Speaking at Marka air base near Amman, Hussein said: ``This (the
PLO decision) is a Palestinian move and I believe it is my duty and
the duty of all our Arab brethren to support it.''
   Israel's parliament, the Knesset, on Wednesday endorsed Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan, which calls for the election of
Palestinian representatives to negotiate limited self-rule of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under the plan, Palestinians would gain
autonomy for five years, then negotiate control of the territories
that Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   In his remarks today, Hussein reiterated that he does not speak
on behalf of the Palestinian people. Jordan ruled the West Bank
between 1950 and 1967, then maintained an active role, speaking for
the Palestinians in international forums. But last year Hussein
handed over that responsibility to the PLO.
   ``The Israeli plan concerns the Palestinian people, and they
have their leadership, the PLO, under chairman Yasser Arafat,''
Hussein said.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
last year proclaimed an independent Palestinian state in the area
that roughly covers the occupied territories.
   Arafat later recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced
terrorism in a peace initiative. That action led the United States
to reverse a 13-year-old policy by opening talks with the PLO.

   A man convicted of misdemeanor
charges for distributing hundreds of videotapes that showed him
having sex with a married woman was placed on probation and warned
to stay away from her.
   Eric Sanderson, 45, of Troy, was sentenced Tuesday to 21 months'
probation, $6,300 in court costs and fines and 416 hours of
community service. He was ordered to stay at least 2,000 yards away
from his ex-lover's house and her husband's business.
   ``It will be straight to jail for you without passing `Go,'''
East Detroit Municipal Judge Benedict Segesta told Sanderson.
   Police said the woman told them she had an affair with Sanderson
in 1987-88. After she broke up with him, he distributed videotapes
he had made surreptitiously of them having sex, she said.
   He was convicted in February of assault and battery, telephone
harassment, reckless driving and littering, all misdemeanors.

<HEAD>Baltic Parliaments Take Up Laws on Economic Autonomy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliaments of the Baltic republics of
Lithuania and Estonia today began considering legislation that
would give them greater economic independence from the federal
government.
   Lithuania's Supreme Soviet declared the republic ``sovereign''
and considered a draft law that would allow Lithuania to print its
own currency, an official in Lithuania's Foreign Ministry said.
   In Estonia, the proposal being debated included provisions for
limited private property.
   Both republics' plans would give them control over virtually all
industry in their territory and declare them the sole masters of
their natural resources.
   The proposed laws conflict with recommendations from a Moscow
commission on how much freedom the Soviet republics should have.
   The commission's proposed law would leave control over energy
and at least half of heavy industry, as well as all defense
production, in the hands of Moscow bureaucrats. It also would
prohibit republics from printing their own money.
   The Lithuanian parliament passed a law granting it general
sovereignty by a large margin, said Geidrius Cekuolis, first
secretary of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. The law specifies
that national Soviet laws are valid in Lithuania only if approved
by the Lithuanian parliament, effectively claiming the republic can
veto Kremlin decisions it does not like.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet passed a similar law in November.
Moscow authorities pronounced the law invalid, but the Estonian
parliament stood by its decision and considers the sovereignty law
in force.
   The Estonian draft law on the economy does not provide for
separate currency, but Supreme Soviet members debated that question
today and it may end up in the law, the Estonian Foreign Ministry
spokesman, Gondo Olevsoo, said in a telephone interview from
Tallinn, Estonia's capital.
   The draft law's section on private property says that,``Within
limits set by the law, small-scale private property is allowed.''
   In a similar vein, the Lithuanian law provides for ``the
economically necessary introduction of plots of land for perpetual
use with the right of inheritance.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed leasing of up
to 50 years or more, but the Communist Party leadership has
explicitly rejected private ownership, which is antithetical to
communist ideology.
   Both republics say the new laws on economic independence should
come into force in 1990.
   Estonia claims full control over its land, water, air space,
forests and other natural resources in the law. All industry,
except defense-related factories, are to be put under control of
local authorities, according to the law.
   The Lithuanian proposal's provision on currency states that the
republic ``can introduce its own money system'' with independent
banks, and that it can ``if necessary print its own state
obligations, stocks and other valuable papers.''
   Latvia, the third Baltic republic, is considering similar
measures on economic independence.

<HEAD>Michael J. Fox Reviews Press' Treatment of his Wedding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Michael J. Fox has taken his revenge
on the tabloid SWAT team that descended on his July 16, 1988,
wedding at an inn here.
   ``Michael J. Fox's Nuptials in Hell,'' in the June issue of
Esquire magazine, is Fox's first-person, tongue-in-cheek version of
how he and his wife, actress Tracy Pollan, kept at bay helicopters,
zoom lenses and an army of 40 reporters from The National Enquirer,
Star, Globe, People magazine and other publications.
   ``Even I, who have called a fishbowl home for most of the last
six years, was astounded by the lengths to which the tabloids would
go in order to satisfy inquiring minds,'' wrote Fox, star of the
film ``Back to the Future'' and the television show ``Family Ties.''
   The magazine story, due out next week, details the apparent
desperation of tabloid journalists, who according to Fox resorted
to bribery, lies and more in an unsuccessful effort to get a photo
of the wedding couple in full regalia at the West Mountain Inn.
   Fox's publicist, Nanci Ryder, went undercover as a temporary
office worker at the National Enquirer's headquarters in a
Manchester luxury hotel, the article said. She reported the
tabloid's strategy to Fox and to a Los Angeles security expert
hired to keep the wedding private.
   After the wedding party succeeded in avoiding photographers, Fox
charged, sore losers among the press took out their frustration by
portraying the couple as paranoid, and their wedding as a security
circus.
   ``The reporters couldn't very well write about their colossal
waste of money and effort, so they projected their own fiasco onto
the wedding,'' wrote Fox, who shared a byline for the story with
brother-in-law Michael Pollan, executive editor of Harper's
magazine.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
today with West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, who
presented some new suggestions for settling a heated dispute
between the two NATO allies over short-range nuclear missiles in
Western Europe.
   The talks are aimed at bridging the gap between the two nations
in order to sidestep confrontation at President Bush's first North
Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, set for later this month.
   State Department officials had no immediate comment on the
outcome of the half-hour meeting, but a diplomatic source familiar
with Stoltenberg's proposals confirmed the West Germans are
prepared to be more flexible on the question of the timing of
U.S.-Soviet negotiations involving the weapons.
   The United States has opposed the idea of starting such
negotiations, fearing they would lead to pressures to remove all
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Stoltenberg's mission was to suggest a possible link between a
reduction of Soviet conventional forces in Europe with the start of
negotiations on cutting back the numbers of the short-range nuclear
weapons. The negotiations might not begin until there is
significant progress in cutting back the conventional arms in
Europe, where the Warsaw Pact has a huge advantage.
   One proposal would be to form a high-level NATO study group,
which would examine how much ``significant progress'' would be
necessary before any U.S.-Soviet talks could convene, the source
said.
   As Stoltenberg held talks with Baker and Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney, a group of West German parliament members expressed
confidence that a solution to the dilema would be found.
   ``There's a new flexibility on both sides. The chances we will
reach an agreement are not 100 percent, but given the political
will, there's a good chance we will reach an agreement'' before the
NATO summit, said Volcker Ruehe, the deputy majority leader in
parliament, in a meeting with reporters.
   Ruehe and a three other members of parliament said they were
pleased with the reception they had gotten from officials at the
Department of State, the National Security Council, and on Capitol
Hill, in their talks on the dispute.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl paved the way for
Stoltenberg's visit with a telephone call Tuesday to President
Bush, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday. He
gave no details of the call, which was initiated by Kohl.
   ``We continue to hope that we can reach some kind of an
agreement before the NATO summit (May 29), but if not, we'll
discuss it there or later,'' Fitzwater said.
   He was referring to the May 29 meeting of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Fitzwater said the dispute may also figure in talks that Bush
will have this weekend with French President Francois Mitterrand at
Bush's home in Maine.
   ``But the meeting is not designed to produce and specific
agreements or results in that sense,'' Fitzwater said.
   The U.S. government opposes the German call for early talks with
the Soviet Union on reducing short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
Bonn objects to Washington's demands for an early NATO commitment
to upgrading NATO's Lance missiles when those weapons become
obsolete in 1995.
   ``We look forward to the Stoltenberg talks and think they'll be
very productive,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked if there had been progress toward a solution, Fitzwater
said, ``Progress in the sense that we're talking and we understand
each other's positions better, but I couldn't give much more
projection than that.''
   Fitzwater said the United States is sticking to its position
that talks should first produce a reduction in Soviet Bloc forces
in Europe to match NATO levels. Only then would the United States
be willing to consider discussing short-range missiles.
   In a satellite interview with European correspondents Wednesday,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said, ``Nuclear weapons are
part of a defensive strategy. We ought to move very, very slowly
before we abandon that strategy.''

<HEAD>Kansas Senator to Seek Re-Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., saying she had
struggled with the decision ``for some time,'' announced today she
will seek re-election to a third term. Her decision dampened hopes
of Democrats to win their first Senate seat from Kansas in 50 years.
   Kassebaum said she will run in the 1990 elections because she
does not want to hurt the state by retiring and leaving it without
her seniority.
   Noting that she had pledged to serve only 12 years when she
first ran for the Senate, Kassebaum said she had ``struggled with
it for some time.'' But she said she decided to seek another term
because there is no limit on the number of years a senator can
serve.
   ``Unless everyone's doing it, you lose seniority ... that is
valuable to one's state,'' Kassebaum said.
   She pledged when she ran for the Senate for the first time in
1978 and again in 1984 that she would retire after 12 years in the
Senate, but she opened the door to a possible third term a short
time after winning re-election in 1984.
   Republicans have been urging Kassebaum to run again, fearing her
retirement would give Democrats their best chance at seizing a
Senate seat in Kansas since 1974, when Republican Sen. Bob Dole
narrowly won a second term. The last Democrat to hold a Senate seat
from Kansas was George McGill, who served from 1930-39.
   Political observers in Kansas consider Kassebaum an odds-on
favorite to win another term. Recent polling by her campaign
organization found that most Kansans would continue to support her
for re-election in 1990 in spite of the two-term pledge.
   Her popularity in Kansas has scared away serious Democratic
opposition in the past, and she won re-election in 1984 with 76
percent of the votes.
   Kassebaum is the daughter of the late Alf Landon, a Kansas
governor and 1936 Republican presidential nominee. She arrived at
the Senate a political novice, with her previous elective
experience limited to a local school board seat.
   She and Democrat Barbara Mikulski of Maryland are the only women
in the 100-member Senate.

   A former preschool director accused of
molesting pupils proclaimed her innocence and said she was relieved
to finally testify in what has become the country's longest
criminal trial.
   Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, is the first of the two remaining
defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case to testify since charges
were brought in 1984.
   She said outside court Wednesday that her attorney had
previously refused to let her testify during the trial, which
entered its third year last month, and during the preliminary
hearing four years ago.
   She added that ill health and the stress of being jailed for
nearly two years nearly sapped her of the strength needed to endure
the witness stand. She's now free on $295,000 bail.
   ``I do have the strength and courage,'' she said confidently.
``I hope we will show that nothing ever happened at the school.''
   ``We are all innocent and have not done one thing wrong,'' she
said. ``That's the point I want to get across to the jury. All
seven of us are innocent, and that's the point I want to get across
to the world.''
   Mrs. Buckey and her 30-year-old son, Raymond Buckey, are the
only remaining defendants in the case that began five years ago
when seven people were charged. They are charged with 65 counts of
molestation and conspiracy. Charges against five other defendants
were dismissed after the District Attorney's Office concluded there
was insufficient evidence.
   Mrs. Buckey, in her second day of testimony Wednesday, described
the activities at the defunct preschool in suburban Manhattan Beach
where nine children testified they were raped or sodomized. Mrs.
Buckey, the school's director and teacher, is charged with
molesting four of them.
   The children have testified that they were photographed nude and
playing such games as ``Naked Movie Star.'' They said they were
threatened into silence by Ray Buckey, who allegedly killed and
mutilated small animals in front of them.
   Mrs. Buckey's attorney, Dean Gits, asked her whether the
children played games in which they pretended to be movie stars.
   ``No,'' Mrs. Buckey replied.
   ``Were there any games, even in an innocent manner, of tickling
of children?'' Gits asked.
   ``No,'' she said.
   ``Did you ever punish them in any corporal way, such as slapping
them on the behind?''
   ``Never,'' she said.
   ``Did you ever stand in the classroom with only your bra on from
the waist up?'' he asked.
   ``Never,'' she said.
   The jurors resumed taking notes during Mrs. Buckey's testimony.
They had been taking notes during the lengthy trial but stopped
last month because they were bored, said Superior Court Judge
William Pounders.
   The marathon case has cost Los Angeles County taxpayers $15
million so far and is still months from a resolution.

   West Germany warned its diplomats
to be on the alert for terrorist attacks after TWA hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi was sentenced to life imprisonment, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said today.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper also reported that West
German security authorities are watching for possible terrorist
attacks at home following the Lebanese Moslem terrorist's
conviction Wednesday.
   ``We have notified our diplomatic personnel of the verdict and
advised them to be on the alert,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Rainer Mueller, said in answer to questions in a telephone
interview.
   A Frankfurt court convicted Hamadi of murder, air piracy and
other charges in connection with the June 1985 hijacking of TWA
Flight 847, during which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was
brutally beaten and shot to death and 39 Americans were held
hostage for 17 days.
   Mueller also said his ministry has no information about two West
German relief workers reported kidnapped in Beirut the day before
Hamadi was sentenced.
   ``We have no direct contact with any group, and we cannot really
say if they have been kidnapped, but we must assume they were,''
Mueller said, adding that a committee has been set up to
investigate the reported kidnappings.
   Heinrich Struebig, 48, and Thomas Kemptner, 28, disappeared from
the Beirut branch of the ASME-Humanitas relief agency along with
West German nurse Petra Schnitzler. Ms. Schnitzler, 26, was later
freed by a unit of the Islamic Grouping, a Sunni Moslem faction
that discovered her in the trunk of a car during a search for
thieves.
   Ms. Schnitzler and Struebig have reported being kidnapped twice
before this year. They say their kidnappers freed them to pass on
demands for a mild sentence for Hamadi.

   A convenience store customer who heard a
muffled cry found a newborn girl at the bottom of a restroom trash
can with toilet paper stuffed in her mouth and ears.
   Ray Turner, 30, said he knew the sound he heard Wednesday wasn't
coming from a cat, as his brother suspected. ``I knew that was a
baby crying,'' he said.
   The infant was taken to Children's Hospital in Birmingham, where
she was in good condition today, said spokeswoman Tina Horton.
   Warrior Police said a woman went into the suburban Birmingham
convenience store Wednesday afternoon and asked to use the
restroom, where she apparently gave birth to the baby in 20 minutes
and left. Turner and his brother came by about 10 minutes later.
   ``Ray and his brother are regulars,'' cashier Kathy Coffey said.
``They're so regular they don't pay any attention to our `Not a
public restroom' sign. Thank goodness for that, though, because an
employee might not have gone in there until 8 p.m.''
   Mrs. Coffey said she let the woman, whom she did not know, use
the bathroom. ``She came in kind of bent over, asking please could
she go to the bathroom. I heard nothing at all (from the restroom)
the whole time.''
   Police Chief Mike Thrash said police were investigating.

   The editor of South Africa's
leading financial newspaper said today police have ordered him to
give testimony about an article he wrote criticizing their failure
to solve a 1986 murder case.
   Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt said police want to pursue
claims by Business Day editor Ken Owen that his reporters found
witnesses able to identify black miners who executed four fellow
workers during a mass protest at a gold mine.
   In a statement published by his newspaper, Owen said he would
comply with the subpoena, but contended the ``improper'' action was
a response to his accusations that Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok handled the case ineffectively.
   The accusations were published Monday in the article in which
Owen scathingly questioned why police had been unable to solve
executions reportedly witnessed by 2,000 black mine workers. The
victims, also black, were accused of breaking a boycott organized
by militant union members.
   ``Vlok and his police have failed the most elementary test of a
government _whether or not it can uphold the common law,'' Owen
wrote. ``If he doesn't have the guts to fire them (his senior
officers) one by one until they do something, he should resign from
his highly paid position and go into the obscurity he deserves.''
   De Witt said in a statement Wednesday that police had been
unable to track down witnesses who could identify the killers and
were willing to testify in court. He said four suspects were
arrested but released for lack of evidence.
   Owen's article was ``unfair and slanderous,'' the commissioner
said.
   De Witt said police asked if he would supply information
voluntarily and were told he would do so only if subpoenaed.
   Business Day said in an editorial, ``The staff of the newspaper
do not wish to act as fact-gatherers or investigators for the
police ... it would close off future sources of information.''

<HEAD>Front-runner for Presidency Urged to Disclose His Plans</HEAD>

   A veteran anti-apartheid
legislator today urged the heir-apparent to the presidency to
reveal his planned policies.
   Helen Suzman said National Party leader F.W. de Klerk ``should
now ... tell us and the world what he definitely will do ... to
restore peace at home and respectability abroad.''
   It is virtually certain that De Klerk, 53, will succeed
President P.W. Botha, who steps down after Sept. 6 general
elections.
   Since becoming leader of the governing party in February, de
Klerk has pledged to seek an end to racial discrimination. But he
has been vague about the type of power-sharing he might extend to
the disenfranchised black majority.
   Mrs. Suzman, 71, who announced on Wednesday she would end her
36-year parliamentary career, said de Klerk ``must put the
country's interests above those of the National Party.'' She urged
him to use his influence to curtail government actions that might
antagonize people.
   ``Deaths in detention, more blatant abrogation of due process,
more hangings, more forced removals are key provocative issues that
must be avoided,'' she said.
   She suggested that de Klerk declare a moratorium on hangings,
suspend residential segregation laws and end efforts to relocate
black communities in tribal homelands.
   ``None of these actions would in any way affect the political
power structure in South Africa,'' Mrs. Suzman said. ``But they
would contribute to creating a climate in which negotiations to
ensure a peaceful future could commence,'' she said.
   South Africa's racial segregation or apartheid policies give the
country's 24 million blacks no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health services.

   Premier Li Peng failed in a tense meeting with
student leaders today to persuade them to end a five-day hunger
strike that has led to nationwide protests and calls for Deng
Xiaoping and other leaders to resign.
   Nearly a million people, including workers, government employees
and grammar school students, flocked to central Beijing for the
second straight day in support of the more than 3,000 weakening
hunger strikers.
   ``The government wants us to go back and forget about dialogue,
they don't comprehend the power of this movement,'' hunger strike
leader Wu'er Kaixi, an oxygen tube in his nose, said from his bed
in Beijing Hospital, where he was rushed after fainting during the
meeting with Li.
   Two students who attended the meeting quoted Li Peng as saying
Beijing has fallen into anarchy and that if the movement does not
end, ``it will be more chaotic than the Cultural Revolution.'' The
1966-76 ultraleftist uprising brought China to the brink of civil
war.
   The national television news broadcast included a segment on the
meeting in the Great Hall of the People that showed Li urging all
steps be taken to save the fasting students.
   He praised the students for raising problems such as official
corruption but added, ``The development of the situation does not
depend on your good will and your intentions. Nobody can control it
now. Beijing already is in disorder and it is spreading to the
whole country.''
   The television did not show the students' response.
   No more meetings were scheduled immediately, according to the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The talks came hours after Li, Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang
and other senior officials visited some of the hundreds of students
hospitalized during the hunger strike, which was also televised.
Leaders were shown listening to students and patting their arms in
concern.
   Beijing television showed Li awkwardly autographing students'
shirts at their request, and saying, ``Where are you from? Go home
now.''
   Authorities have commended the students' enthusiasm for
democracy but have not agreed to their demands for a dialogue on
reform to be broadcast live.
   The students have been agitating for reforms including press
freedom, an end to official corruption as well as recognition of
their independent unions.
   They began their fast for democracy Saturday in central
Tiananmen Square, China's symbolic center of power, which they have
turned into a vast tent camp decorated by protest banners. So many
have taken ill that one luxury hotel was turned into a makeshift
hospital.
   On Wednesday, more than 1 million people marched in support of
the hunger strikers in an outpouring that repeatedly disrupted the
state visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to end a
30-year chill in relations with China.
   In Beijing today, a steady stream of hundreds of trucks filled
with workers, some wearing factory uniforms and banging their hard
hats against the sideboard, rumbled toward Tiananmen, which was
drenched in a midafternoon thunderstorm. Many of the vehicles had
large posters that said, ``Support the students.'' Posters of Mao
Tse-tung began to spring up, with demonstrators saying he cared for
the people before he went senile in his final years.
   Official newspapers offered comprehensive and sympathetic
coverage to the protests, a departure from past policy.
   Protesters marched for a second day in Shanghai, which Gorbachev
was visiting, and industrial strikes in support of the students
were also reported.
   Smaller marches were held Wednesday in more than 20 provincial
capitals.
   In Beijing, 200 Communist Party members marched behind a banner
that called for the resignation of China's 84-year-old senior
leader: ``Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the party members want you to take
a rest.''
   Several hundred workers marched shouting, ``Step down Li Peng,''
while a group of high school students chanted, ``Xiaoping,
Xiaoping, 80 years old, and not very sharp.''
   The independent student union that has spearheaded the democracy
movement also called on Deng to step down. Deng's last official
post is chairman of the Central Military Commission but he still is
active in setting policy.
   Unconfirmed rumors sweeping Tiananmen that he already had
retired were wildly cheered.
   Nearly 250,000 students marched today in Shanghai, where about
200 students were staging a hunger strike in front of city hall.
Thousands of cheering workers lined the march route, said Jason
Hurtado of Portland, Ore., a teacher at Shanghai's Fudan University.
   The Beijing marchers have included members of the Communist
Party Youth League, government workers, soldiers, private
businessmen, factory workers, teachers, doctors, students, writers,
artists.
   The hunger strikers moved into buses parked in Tiananmen this
morning when dark skies threatened rain, but said they would not
move from the square.
   ``I'm drinking, so I'm still hanging on, but I feel really,
really hungry and I don't have much energy,'' said faster Wei Wei.
   ``We won't give up until we get our goals,'' a protest leader
said over a student-rigged loudspeaker system.
   Zhao, Li and several other senior officials went to two
hospitals at about 4 a.m. and visited hunger strikers.
   Qiao Shi, who is in charge of Communist Party discipline, was
quoted as telling one hunger-striker, ``It's best you go back to
class.''

   President Bush, stumping for his
education proposals with a visit to an urban magnet school, vowed
today to spur U.S. businesses to ``help education help America.''
   Bush, stopping here on his way to a long weekend in
Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was to meet with French President
Francois Mitterrand, sought to focus attention on his $441 million
legislative package for education.
   ``The fact is that unless we act, our children will be
ill-equipped to read, write or understand new technologies,'' he
said.
   The president spoke during a tour of an Eastman Kodak
photographic plant after visiting the Wilson Magnet High School,
which offers special courses in computer science, robotics,
photo-optics and Japanese language studies.
   At the school, Bush met first with teachers to discuss the
magnet program, then chatted with about 350 students.
   ``Commitment was the word that kept coming through,'' the
president said of his meeting with the teachers.
   ``You're the future,'' he told cheering students. ``I'm going to
do my level best, as president _ leave aside the politics _ to get
this message of excellence and commitment and magnet schools way
beyond the confines of New York, all the way to the West Coast and
Alaska.''
   He praised Kodak for putting up some of the funds that he said
helped the city school overcome a high dropout rate and a poor
academic showing several years ago to become one of the top-rated
schools in New York state.
   ``Ten years ago, Wilson was beset by crime, plunging grades and
urban flight,'' Bush said. ``But today ... Wilson is the
ninth-ranked school in the state of New York by the Department of
Education.''
   ``Rochester and Kodak embody the notion that helping others
through cooperation ... is America at her best,'' the president
said.
   He challenged other U.S. companies to follow the lead set by the
photo giant, which he said forged a partnership with the community,
``which understood that the private sector has the resources and
responsibility to help education help America.''
   Bush's education package, sent to Congress on April 5, calls for
$100 million in new U.S. spending on magnet schools such as Wilson
that offer special courses.
   Congressional Democrats and educators have criticized the plan
as inadequate, and the president conceded today that ``our program
is not a be-all and end-all.''
   But, he said, ``it is a commitment. A commitment to help
business and academia make America more productive.''
   Before leaving Washington, Bush met at the White House with
Nobel Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other South
African anti-apartheid leaders.
   Congressional leaders and anti-apartheid activitists urged the
administration on Wednesday to impose additional economic sanctions
against the white minority-ruled Pretoria government.
   However, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
``Generally speaking, we have not found sanctions productive and
have opposed additional sanctions as being counter-productive.''
   Under Bush's proposal, the federal education budget would go
from $21.9 billion this year to $22.5 billion in fiscal 1990, which
begins Oct. 1.
   Major new initiatives are $250 million for a merit schools
program and $100 million for magnet schools offering specialized
curriculum with an emphasis on math and science.
   The Education Department already runs a $115 million magnet
school program, but the money is available only for desegregation
purposes.
   The Wilson school in Rochester ``is exactly the kind of thing
the president has been talking about in his education policy _
where the community and business interests get together to address
the problem,'' said deputy White House press secretary Stephen Hart.
   Ten years ago, the school was among those with New York's
highest rates of suspensions, dropouts and truencies.
   The community, with the help of a $300,000 grant from the
Eastman Kodak Co., helped rewrite the school's curriculum to focus
on science and humanities and provided the school with up-to-date
equipment. Now, the school is one of the highest-ranked in the
state, according to information supplied by the White House.
   Bush was to fly from Rochester to Kennebunkport, Maine, for a
long weekend at his family oceanside retreat later today.
Mitterrand was to join Bush on Saturday.
   ``They'll have a very enjoyable series of discussions covering
the wide range of issues important to the United States and France,
including the NATO summit coming up,'' Fitzwater told reporters on
Wednesday.
   Mitterrand will accompany Bush to Boston on Sunday, where the
president will deliver the commencement address at Boston
University.
   Aides said the Boston speech would focus on NATO, a week before
Bush attends a NATO summit celebrating the alliance's 40th
anniversary.
   Bush and Mitterrand planned to hold a joint news conference
Sunday afternoon in Boston.

   The Federal Aviation Administration wants the
power to ground pilots who are flying airplanes after having their
motor vehicle licenses suspended or revoked for drunken driving.
   More than 10,000 licensed pilots have drunken driving records,
but officials said they had not determined how many might be
affected. The FAA last month announced it was cracking down on more
than 1,000 pilots who had failed to report drunken driving actions.
   Under a proposed rule published in today's Federal Register, the
FAA could deny an application or suspend a pilot's certificate if
the individual's license is revoked or suspended for an offense
involving alcohol or drugs twice within three years.
   The rule-making follows concerns raised by the National
Transportation Safety Board over pilots who were allowed to fly
even though their automobile driver's licenses were suspended for
drunken driving. The board has raised similar concerns over ship
captains and others not under FAA jurisdiction.
   The FAA rule would require that pilots report any alcohol- or
drug-related convictions or administrative action that occurred
within a three-year period before the rule takes effect. Failure to
report subsequent actions within 60 days after they occur would be
grounds for losing a pilot's license.
   The rule would become final later this year if it passes a
public comment period and further analysis by FAA lawyers, said
agency spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane.
   In a 1987 comparison of FAA medical records with the National
Driver Register, the agency found that driver's licenses of 10,300
of the more than 700,000 active pilots had been suspended or
revoked in the preceding seven years for drunken driving.
   More than three-fourths of those did not report the convictions
to the FAA when applying for a medical certificate to fly, although
such a report is required, the agency said.
   The new rule also would cause a pilot's medical certificate to
expire 61 days after a single drunken driving conviction and
require reapplication with proof that the pilot was enrolled in an
alcohol treatment program.
   Both a medical certificate and a pilot certificate are required
to fly.

   The commander of the Atlantis space shuttle
says he will cooperate ``to the best of my ability'' with three
federal investigations into accusations that he nearly ran his
space agency jet into a Pan Am airliner.
   Navy Capt. David M. Walker, who commanded the five-member
shuttle crew on a four-day voyage that ended May 8, said ``all the
facts have yet to be established'' on the incident. The pilot of a
Pan Am Airbus 310 carrying 166 passengers and a crew of 10 from
Washington to Paris initially reported the close call.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation
Safety Board and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
all opened investigations into the incident after the Pan Am pilot
filed a report of a ``near midair collision.''
   The pilot said the NASA T-38 jet came within 500 feet of the
airliner.
   ``I will be assisting to the best of my ability with both NASA
and civil aviation authorities in their respective
investigations,'' Walker said. ``To discuss the issue further at
this point would be inappropriate.''
   Walker had flown to Washington for White House ceremonies on
Tuesday honoring the Atlantis crew.
   A NASA statement said Walker filed a ``hazardous air traffic
report'' with personnel at Andrews Air Force Base upon landing.
Spokesman Jack Riley said he did not know the nature of the report
or its contents.
   FAA air traffic controllers filed a ``pilot deviation report''
accusing Walker of violating flight procedures by not flying at his
assigned altitude and saying the planes were within 100 feet
vertically, said FAA spokesman Jack Leyden.
   The Pan Am jet was flying at 7,000 feet and Walker was assigned
to travel at 8,000 feet but descended to 7,000, the FAA spokesman
said. The controllers issued an advisory that two planes were in
the same area, and Walker took his jet to 8,000 feet, Leyden said.
   ``It was a very quick, like instantaneous sighting,'' said Pan
Am spokesman Alan Loflin. He said both planes were flying under
instrument conditions but the Pan Am pilot saw the T-38 because
they were between cloud layers when they crossed paths.
   Leyden said both FAA and safety board investigators on Wednesday
began looking into the incident, but details of their work were not
available.
   A near collision generally is reported when two planes come
within 500 feet of each other and either pilot feels they are in
danger of colliding.
   The FAA considers an incident ``critical'' when planes came
within 100 feet of each other at their closest point and
``potentially dangerous'' when they come within 500 feet.
   Leyden said possible enforcement action against a civilian pilot
who deviates from procedures could range from an administrative
letter to action affecting his license. But he said that since
Walker is a Navy pilot, any conclusion would likely be referred to
the military for further action.
   The safety board, which assigned three investigators to the
case, will determine the cause of the incident and recommend steps
to be taken to prevent it from happening again, but the board has
no power to impose penalties.
   NASA spokesman Riley said the Johnson Space Center was informed
of the near collision on Wednesday. Flight crew operations and
safety personnel will conduct a ``detailed investigation'' of the
incident, hesaid.
   No NASA T-38 has crashed since the 1960s, when four astronauts
were killed in three accidents. Riley said he was not aware of any
previous near-collision reports involving the 24 NASA T-38s which
the astronauts use to maintain required flying hours and to travel
between assignments.

   President Bush, stressing his ``abhorrence of
apartheid,'' today pledged American pressure to bring about
``justice and equality'' in South Africa, his spokesman said.
   The president, after meeting with Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Desmond Tutu, invited Albertina Sisulu, one of the leaders of the
United Democatic Front in South Africa to visit the United States,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The president shares the archbishop's abhorrence of
apartheid,'' Fitzwater said. ``The president promised to stress his
opposition in every way possible. The asministration will be
looking at ways to best use American pressure, influence and
leverage to bring about justice and equality to South Africa.
   Tutu, who heads the Anglican Church in South Africa, said he
urged Bush to ``take the moral leadership'' toward ending his
country's apartheid policies of racial separation and said he was
enouraged the president had a ``warm openness'' to that cause.
   ``We do not want to be overly optimistic,'' Tutu told reporters,
adding he had been impressed that Bush appeared to genuinely abhor
apartheid, that he wanted to be ``a catalyst for change'' and ``a
positive influence.''
   Tutu and two other anti-apartheid leaders, Revs. Allan Boesak
and Beyers Naude, who met briefly with Bush at the White House, did
not disclose the specifics of their conversation. Tutu indicated,
however, they did not ask for specific initiatives other than that
Bush urge Pretoria to negotiate with its opposition.
   Asked about the discussion, Tutu said: ``We said we wanted to
help the United States ... to take the moral leadership of the
world in helping to end apartheid and bringing the South African
government to the negotiating table, which is our primary end.''
   Although the White House said a day earlier that Bush does not
intend to back further sanctions against Pretoria to press for
social change, in essence maintaining the policy of President
Reagan, the leaders were upbeat after the meeting.
   ``I think there is a very warm openness and we think the door
stands ajar. No door has been slammed in our face,'' Tutu said.
   At a news conference later, the group said Bush and Congress
should support sanctions that would squeeze the economically
strapped South African government and force it to the negotiating
table.
   Boesak also urged Bush to take advantage of indications of a
recent Soviet shift in southern Africa toward more pragmatic
policies or ask himself ``the question: will we be trailing behind
(Kremlin leader Mikhail) Gorbachev again?''
   If Bush fails to understand the importance of resolving the
South African problem for the stability of the region and for
superpower relations, ``then it's not only our funeral, it's his
too,'' Boesak said.
   The meeting itself was seen as a small victory for the
anti-apartheid activists.
   Under President Reagan, whose veto of anti-Pretoria sanctions
was overridden by Congress, ``we had the idea that here was a
position that was taken and there was no further possibility of
even discussing the issue. Here we have a feeling that the
president has not closed his mind to any possibility of how he
could best be helpful in the South African situation,'' said Boesak.
   ``And the very fact that he values the opinion of those of us
who represent black people in South Africa, that in itself is a
sign that we did not get in the same measure from the previous
administration.''
   The White House session was scheduled as U.S. officials were
preparing for the visit of F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to
succeed President P.W. Botha after Botha resigns in September. De
Klerk would be the first top South African leader to officially
visit here in 30 years.
   Tutu, as well as Democrats in Congress, said Bush's failure to
meet with the trio would have shown his unwillingness to support an
end to South Africa's racial segregation system.
   Anti-apartheid leaders believe a window of opportunity may be
created both by the new U.S. administration and by the anticipated
change in their country's leadership. De Klerk has called for
political reforms, although he has ruled out complete
enfranchisement for blacks, who comprise 85 percent of the nation's
population.
   The Reagan administration argued that sanctions impoverish South
Africa's 28 million blacks rather than forcing the government to
reform.

   Striking teachers at Makerere University
went back to work Thursday after meeting with President Yoweri
Museveni on their demand for higher wages.
   Fredrick Juuko, chairman of Makerere University Academic Staff
Association, said Museveni had promised to seek solutions to the
teachers' problems.
   The teachers said they decided to suspend the strike, which
began May 2, but not call it off ``because it is the only weapon we
have.'' They resumed teaching in the afternoon.
   The teachers are demanding a salary increase from about $35 a
month for professors to about $576 a month.
   Museveni met representatives of the teachers Wednesday, a few
hours after they defied a government ultimatum to return to work at
the state-run university or face dismissal.
   Museveni, who is the university's chancellor, agreed to preside
at a new round of wage negotiations beginning Saturday, Juuko said.
   On Wednesday, hundreds of students supported their teachers'
defiance of the government's ultimatum to resume work.

   The accident, which is under investigation, occurred at
Yausubetsu, one of five major exercise facilities in Hokkaido,

   Demonstrators at Exxon Corp.'s annual
shareholders meeting today accused the company of lying about the
Alaskan oil spill and said they hoped the disaster would end oil
exploration in that region.
   Barry Commoner, a long-time ecologist and former presidential
candidate, told about 250 demonstrators lining the entranceway to
the Aspen Manor Hotel that the spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound shows the United States' overreliance on fossil fuels.
   ``We are here to pass judgment on a crime against nature and the
American people,'' Commoner told the crowd as some 80 police
officers stood by. ``That is the only adequate description for what
Exxon has done in Alaska.''
   Consumer activist Ralph Nader and leaders of national and state
environmental groups also planned to address the crowd, which
assembled peacefully outside the hotel and displayed signs saying
``Overthrow Exxon'' and ``Clean up your entire mess'' as
stockholders arrived for the meeting.
   Isabel Byrd, of Trenton, was dressed in an overstuffed tuxedo,
wore a pig's nose and walked on stilts. She said her outfit
represented the company's corporate mentality.
   Steve Kosnac, of Somerville, who said he had helped lay the
Alaskan pipeline in the 1970s, accused Exxon of deliberately
spilling the oil that poured from the hull of the grounded tanker
Exxon Valdez. Spoiling the coastline of Prince William Sound would
render it useless for anything but oil exploration, he said.
   Weldon Monsport, of Boonton, said, ``Exxon has lied from the
start and the government has dragged their feet and knuckles.'' He
carried a sign that said ``Exxon PR Is More Viscous Goo On The
Truth.''
   Township Mayor Frank Priore, a spectator at the demonstration,
said his sympathies lay with the protesters and that he would ask
Exxon to pay the police overtimes costs, which he estimated as high
as $18,000.

   President Bush has nominated Army Lt. Gen.
William H. Harrison to become the next commander of the 6th U.S.
Army at the Presidio of San Francisco.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Harrison will replace Lt. Gen.
James E. Moore Jr., whom the Pentagon announced Thursday would
retire on July 1 after more than 35 years of active duty service.
   And in a related move, the Pentagon said President Bush had
nominated Maj. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller for promotion to the rank of
lieutenant general and to replace Harrison in his current
assignment.
   Harrison, 55, is a native of Pembroke, Ky., who is currently
serving as the commanding general of the Army's I Corps and Fort
Lewis, Wash. Assuming Senate confirmation, Waller will pin on his
third star and replace Harrison in that job.
   Waller, 51, is a native of Baton Rouge, La., who is currently
serving as the commanding general of the 8th Infantry Division of
U.S. Army Europe and the 7th Army.
   Moore, 57, is a native of Fort Thomas, Ky., who is retiring
after having headed the 6th U.S. Army since June 1987.

   Confronted with a relatively common toxin,
certain cells designed to protect the body can overreach and may
even make things worse, a Colorado researcher reported Thursday.
   Poisons produced by a bacteria blamed for many cases of food
poisoning and toxic shock syndrome can cause a massive reaction by
the body's T-cells, causing them to flood the body with potent
chemicals, explained Dr. Philippa Marrack of the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute in Denver.
   She is part of a team of researchers who reported their findings
in the journal Science, published by the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.
   Normally T-cells help protect the body by reproducing and
issuing chemicals to attack invading organisms.
   Under ordinary circumstances, such as the flu, a complex series
of five receptors is activated to set off the T-cells, meaning that
only about one cell in 10,000 to 100,000 may react to the invader,
Dr. Marrack explained in a telephone interview.
   The coupling mechanism is much simpler with staphylococcus
aurens, a bacteria that is associated with toxic shock syndrome,
many cases of food poisoning and some other human and animal
diseases, she reported.
   In this case, only one of the five receptors has to be
stimulated to cause the T-cells to reapond, Dr. Marrack said.
   ``The toxins might activate as many as one-third of the body's
one trillion T-cells almost simultaneously,'' she explained.
   This massive triggering of T-cells causes them to multiply
rapidly and discharge potent chemicals. In such quantities these
chemicals can make the invidiual ill or even cause death, she
reported.
   ``These chemicals, and not the toxin, probably produce the
symptoms of food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome,'' she said in
a statement released by the institute, which is located at the
National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine.
   Dr. Marrack speculated that while the immune system is designed
to attack invaders, causing such an overreation may actually
protect the staphylococcus aurens bacteria. By overstimulating the
system they may prevent it from being able to concentrate on the
one invader, she said.
   Just how this process works and why the reaction varies from one
person to another are not understood, she added.
   Most victims of staphylococcus aurens food poisoning recover
with no long-term effects, she said. But cases have been reported
in which victims later developed an immune system-related form of
arthritis.
   The new findings may explain this.
   ``Suppose a small number of T-cells in your body have a tendency
to attack your own joints, but they've never had enough energy or
numbers to do so,'' she said. ``If a bacterial toxin stimulates
these cells, causing them to multiply rapidly, you could wind up
with a large number of `bad guys' that could cause arthritis, lupus
or some other autoimmune disease.''
   On the other hand, in the long run the response may also be able
to be used against such cells, according to Dr. Marrack. If a group
of T-cells attacking the body could be identified, a toxin might be
tailored to stimulate them to multiply and then drugs used which
kill only multiplying cells.
   Such a treatment, however, is not currently feasible and may not
be for years, she said.
   Other researchers taking part in the study included John
Kappler, also of the Howard Hughes Institute; Brian Kotzin, Lynne
Herron, Erwin Gelfand and Yongwon Choi of the National Jewish
Center; Robert D. Bigler of Hanneman University, Philadelphia;
Arthur Boylston, University of Leeds, England; Stefan Carrel,
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Lausanne, Switzerland; and
David Ponsett of Cornell University Medical College, New York.

<TEXT>
   An all-white jury today convicted a former
Ku Klux Klansman of murder for providing the rope and pistol used
in the killing of a black teen-ager whose body was hung in a tree.
   Benjamin Franklin Cox, 27, whispered ``I love you'' to his
weeping wife before county deputies led him away in handcuffs.
   Circuit Judge Michael Zoghby revoked Cox's $28,000 bond and set
a June 23 sentencing hearing. Cox could be sentenced to 10 years to
life in the March 21, 1981, strangulation and hanging of
19-year-old Michael Donald.
   Prosecutors said Donald was killed by Klansmen angry about a
1981 trial in which a black man was found innocent of killing a
white policeman.
   The verdict was delivered to a hushed courtroom filled with
relatives and friends of both the victim and the defendant. The
jury deliberated about four hours over two days.
   Cox's conviction was the third successful prosecution in the
last six years of trials stemming from the Klan murder. Defense
attorneys put on witnesses on the stand, while the state called at
least a dozen witnesses.
   In closing arguments, defense attorney Neil Hanley said the
witnesses against Cox had been ``coached and badgered'' into giving
false testimony.
   ``There is more than reasonable doubt ... there is a shocking
doubt in this case,'' Hanley said.
   Hanley described the prosecution's case as ``zero plus zero
equals zero,'' drawing the equation on a board. ``That's his
circumstantial evidence.''
   District Attorney Chris Galanos urged jurors to consider the
``big picture'' in which he claimed Cox participated in the
``organized and orchestrated'' Klan murder. Galanos called the
slaying ``senseless, mindless violence ... not just racism _ hate.''
   ``These people were Klansmen,'' Galanos said. ``Ordinary,
civilized people would never sit around and talk about taking the
life of another human being.''

   House Republicans, after years of fighting the
ruling Democrats with noisy protests and parliamentary warfare, are
sitting back and smiling as they watch the storm encircling House
Speaker Jim Wright.
   The Texas Democrat is facing charges before the House ethics
committee and is the topic of nearly daily reports in the national
news media.
   The ethics panel decided today to hold a hearing next Tuesday on
Wright's motions to dismiss the main charges against him, and the
arguments by lawyers for the two sides will be open to television
coverage.
   Wright's spokeman, Mark Johnson, said the speaker welcomed the
development, and would renew his call for the committee to expedite
its procedures.
   In addition to the speaker's troubles, press reports have forced
Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., Wright's chief vote-counter, to revise
and defend his own financial disclosure statements.
   But most House Republicans aren't putting out press releases,
making speeches about it, or even attacking the speaker in
conversations with reporters.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2 House Republican who
launched the probe against Wright, continues to comment when asked,
but he's avoiding television interviews on the topic. Asked what he
was thinking about a story involving Coelho's financial dealings,
he answered: ``I don't.''
   Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, chairman of the House Republican
Conference, says he has urged his colleagues to remain quiet in
deference to the ethics process, which eventually could require all
members to pass judgment on the speaker.
   Lewis and Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader,
made clear they're happy to have the news media take on the speaker
without them.
   ``Far be it from this member to put any kind of cloud over a
free press,'' Michel said at a session with reporters following
President Bush's visit with House Republicans on Wednesday.
   ``Far be it,'' seconded Lewis, with a broad smile.
   A rank-and-file GOP member, speaking on condition his name not
be used, said the Republicans are in the catbird seat. ``For once,
good politics is also good policy,'' he said.
   While not directly attacking the Democrats on ethics, the
Republicans are needling the Democrats for the slow pace of
legislation and blaming it on ``disarray'' in Wright's leadership
team.
   Michel said ``it takes a strong hand'' to push through
contentious legislation, such as the supplemental spending bill
which House Democrats failed for a second time Wednesday to push
forward to a final vote.
   For Wright, ``I think that power... has been eroded by what
we've been witness to in the last several months,'' Michel said.
   Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington, the majority leader and the
next ranking Democrat after Wright, defended the speaker Wednesday
as ``fully involved'' and said there was no ``gridlock'' in the
House, as the Republicans claimed.
   But it is clear Wright's problems are much on the minds of
Democrats. A group of more than a dozen moderate Democrats who have
been supportive of Wright held a grim hour-long meeting in the
Capitol on Wednesday to discuss the speaker's plight.
   The group was scheduled to meet again today, and one lawmaker
said the subject of the meetings was ``too hot'' to discuss
publicly. A House member familiar with the discussions said one
topic is whether a protracted defense of the speaker will prove too
politically damaging to the party.
   One of the participants, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said he argued
that Wright should have an opportunity to make his legal case on
the ethics charges without delay.
   But, Obey added, Wright ``will also have to _ at some other
time, I would hope _ make a judgment about the political
situation.''
   Obey said the discussion revolved around ``whether or not Jim
can get a review on the issues without the political question ...
getting in the way.''
   The ethics committee, meanwhile, continued to investigate a gas
drilling venture last year that yielded a quick $170,000 profit for
Wright at a time when he needed $100,000 to pay off a bank loan for
another deal that went sour.
   The panel also was meeting today to decide how to handle
Wright's motion to dismiss the two most serious sets of charges
against him: that he sought to evade limits on outside income
through bulk sales of his book, and that he accepted improper gifts
from business partner George Mallick, deemed by the panel to have
had a direct interest in legislation.
   The motions to dismiss charges are important because they
represent a chance to win a badly needed victory and to avoid a
full-blown hearing on the matters that could be the most
embarrassing to the speaker.
   ``The motions are quite significant,'' Wright said, repeating
his argument that the ethics committee is seeking to hold him to
some new and higher standard than provided for in House rules.
``Members need an assurance that the rules mean what they say and
won't be changed to fit the specific situation. It's important not
just to me but to the whole Congress.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that the criminal division
of the Internal Revenue Services is conducting a preliminary
investigation into the speaker's business dealings with Mallick.
   The Times, quoting unidentified federal sources, said agents
from the IRS' Dallas bureau were looking at a broad range of
transactions involving Mallightco, the company formed by the two
men and their wives.
   At IRS headquarters in Washington, spokesman Wilson Fadely
declined comment on the report. ``The IRS is prohibited by law from
disclosing whether or not we are investigating any taxpayer,'' he
said.

<HEAD>FAA Announces New Requirements For Aging Airliners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities today announced
requirements that U.S. airlines make extensive modifications on
older Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s, marking a major change in the
government's approach to the safety of aging airliners.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued a series of proposed
``airworthiness directives'' that initially will affect 115
airliners, requiring $142 million in modifications.
   ``The action marks a fundamental change in FAA's philosophy for
maintaining the airworthiness of older aircraft,'' the FAA said in
announcing the directives which are expected to become final in
late summer.
   The action was prompted by the April 1988 accident in which a
Boeing 737 with nearly 90,000 flights lost an 18-foot section of
its fuselage in a flight over Hawaii. A flight attendant died. The
aircraft then landed without any other fatalities.
   Investigators found the plane's fuselage had worn out, and a
series of regular inspections were ordered on all aging airliners.
   FAA's action today would replace most required inspections for
corrosion, cracking and other signs of metal fatigue with mandatory
replacements.
   Among work that would have to be done on the planes are
strengthening of basic structures and replacement of such parts as
landing gears.
   One requirement for 747s calls for a major modification of the
fuselage shell structure from the nose to the forward main
passenger entry door. The FAA estimates the work will take 14,000
man hours per airplane.
   Airlines would be allowed four years to complete all the
changes, with inspection programs to continue in the interim.
   The FAA said the orders would affect 67 Boeing 727s, 28 737s and
20 747s now being flown by U.S. airlnes. Additional aircraft would
be affected as they reach 20 years of age or a set number of
flights: 60,000 for 727s, 75,000 for 737s and 20,000 for 747s.
   Although foreign airlines flying the U.S.-built planes are not
required to comply, they generally follow FAA safety directives.
   The FAA annoucement said the agency would work with airlines to
assure that older airliners which have the greatest use or which
have not undergone recent inspections will have the work done first.
   The requirements follow guidelines proposed Feb. 28 by a task
force of aviation industry and government experts set up by the Air
Transport Association and the Aerospace Industries Associaton.

   The U.S. Supreme Court today cleared
the way for a 15-year-old Florida girl to obtain an abortion
without the consent of her parents or a judge.
   The justices, without comment or any recorded dissenting vote,
set aside an order issued by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on Tuesday
that had blocked any abortion for the Lake County girl, identified
in court records as T.W.
   The court's action makes unenforceable a Florida law requiring
minors to get permission from their parents or a state judge before
having an abortion.
   A state judge earlier this month struck down the law as
unconstitutional, and his ruling was upheld by a state appeals
court. The Florida Supreme Court plans to consider the law's
constitutionality in September.
   The state appeals court said the law's provision permitting a
judge to approve an abortion for a young girl is too vague and
could result in arbitrary denials of permission by judge.
   Kennedy had acted on a request by a lawyer appointed to
represent the girl's 12-week-old fetus.
   An anti-abortion activist said today she remains hopeful that
the Florida Supreme Court will uphold the abortion-consent law, and
said she was encouraged that the U.S. Supreme Court had become
involved in the case.
   ``It is not as if they have washed their hands of the serious
matter the young lady has been involved in. I would like to think
they still have a concern in the parental consent bill,'' said Jean
Doyle, executive director of Florida Right to Life in Orlando.
   ``The fact they took it up, the fact they were interested is for
me a matter of excitement,'' she said. ``I have not lost the
excitement, the fact it was a matter of such importance the court
would be willing to consider it.''
   On Wednesday, the Florida attorney general's office filed papers
with the high court asking that the state be considered a party to
the case because it involves the validity of its abortion consent
law.
   ``The state is not interested in whether this minor can prove
her case,'' said Assistant Attorney General Jerry Curington.
``We're simply trying to uphold the statute itself.''
   The abortion consent law, which went into effect in February,
requires unmarried girls under age 18 to obtain permission from
their parents or a judge to have an abortion.
   The 15-year-old girl asked a Lake County court for permission to
get an abortion without her parents' consent, saying she could not
approach her parents without fear of emotional or physical abuse.
   Circuit Judge Jerry Lockett, who appointed a lawyer to represent
the girl's fetus, denied the permission but ruled the consent law
was unworkable and unconstitutionally vague. A state appeals court
also ruled it unconstitutional.
   Kennedy's order blocking the abortion came hours after the state
Supreme Court said it would allow the girl to get an abortion and
that it would rule this fall on the law's constitutionality.
   The request went to Kennedy because he is assigned to the 11th
U.S. Judicial Circuit, which includes Florida.
   The girl's attorney, Jerri Blair, wants the stay lifted. She
said some clinics won't perform abortions after the 13th week of
pregnancy because of a greater risk of medical complications.
   Ms. Blair said her request argues that it would be improper for
the U.S. Supreme Court to consider a motion filed on behalf of a
fetus. She cited the high court's 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade that
upheld the right of women to have abortions.
   ``Under Roe vs. Wade the fetus has no (legal) standing,'' Ms.
Blair said.
   Florida is among 14 states with consent laws, but two are
unenforced and three have been blocked by courts, said Kathryn
Kolbert, an American Civil Liberties lawyer in New York City.
   In 12 other states, Ms. Kolbert said, parents must only be
notified about the abortion, but that is not enforced in four
states and courts have blocked the laws in five other states.
   Attorney Hunter Limbaugh, who assisted the attorney representing
the fetus, said they asked for continued enforcement of the law to
make sure the issue is preserved for future consideration by the
U.S. Supreme Court. The issue could be declared moot if the girl
obtained an abortion.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of protesters in
11 cities burned effigies of President Roh Tae-woo and called for
the expulsion of U.S. troops Thursday, the anniversary of a bloody
1980 uprising.
   At least 100,000 students, townspeople and opposition supporters
rallied in Kwangju to denounce Roh and the United States for
suppressing the uprising in the provincial capital that left 192
dead.
   They burned effigies representing Roh and other senior army
generals. Protesters beat drums and chanted ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!''
``Yankee go home!'' and ``Drive out the Yankee imperialists!''
   Earlier Thursday, 20,000 people visited the cemetery outside
Kwangju where many of those killed in the nine-day uprising are
buried. Mourners prayed and bowed before the graves as funeral
music played over loudspeakers and students beat drums.
   In Seoul and nine other cities, thousands joined marches,
protests and religious services. About 40,000 students turned out
for rallies at 87 campuses nationwide, news reports said.
   ``Roh Tae-woo must step down for suppressing Kwangju and all
democratic movements,'' dissident leader Oh Chung-il told the
cheering crowd in Kwangju, 170 miles southwest of Seoul.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said in a message read to
cheering crowds that right-wing forces were plotting to impose
authoritarian rule in South Korea again.
   ``We must remain alert to crush them and inherit the spirit of
Kwangju,'' Kim said in the message.
   Most protests were peaceful, but radical students in southern
Chonju hurled firebombs at a government party office and clashed
with riot police who tried to disperse about 2,000 marchers,
according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. About 20 people
were injured, Yonhap said.
   In Seoul, thousands of riot police stood by to block protests
and chased bands of students who ran through the streets shouting
anti-government slogans. But there were no reports of injuries.
   Past anniversaries of the Kwangju uprising were marked by
violent protests, but dissident leaders called for peaceful
demonstrations this time.
   It was the first time the government had permitted a
demonstration in Kwangju to mark the May 18 uprising.
   At the cemetery, protesters burned an effigy representing Roh,
former President Chun Doo-hwan and the United States. The
6-foot-high figure of a man was capped with a cardboard top hat
decorated with the American flag.
   Dissident groups called for Roh's resignation and the expulsion
of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea. They say Washington
has helped to keep Roh and past authoritarian governments in power.
   They also charge the United States failed to prevent the bloody
suppression of the uprising and is morally responsible.
   Crowds hiked to the cemetery in the hills outside Kwangju.
Elderly mothers, dressed in long traditional white mourning robes,
sobbed and cried hysterically before the graves of sons killed in
the uprising.
   ``My son, my son!'' sobbed one woman.
   Other mourners placed fruit or drinks on the graves and burned
scented candles to honor the dead.
   Columns of radical students carried red, blue and yellow flags
and chanted slogans.
   Roh was a senior general when townspeople and students seized a
government armory in Kwangju on May 18, 1980, and took control of
the city. Troops were sent in to put down the uprising after
negotiations failed.
   Government reports said 192 people were killed and hundreds
injured. But opposition groups claim hundreds more were killed.
   Anti-government sentiment in Kwangju, a traditional opposition
stronghold, has been inflamed by the death of a radical student
earlier this month. Dissidents alleged that police killed Lee
Chol-kyu, whose body was found in a reservoir outside Kwangju May
10.
   South Korea has been hit by violent anti-government protests and
labor strikes in recent months. Dissidents and radical students
have called for the overthrow of the Roh government, but they lack
public support because of their violent tactics.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes to Require Greater Bailout Contribution by S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel voted today to make savings and
loan banks add $600 million over the next three years to their
share of an industry bailout, and potentially billions of dollars
more over the next three decades.
   The Ways and Means Committee, however, rejected raising taxes
through a 1.5 percent surtax for five years to pay for the
government's immediate $50 billion share of the costs in assuring
depositors in insolvent S&amp;Ls against losses.
   On a voice vote, the committee said S&amp;Ls have to contribute $600
million more to the bailout's cost in 1991 and 1992 and potentially
billions of dollars more over the next three decades by indexing
increases in a required $300 million annual contribution to the
rate of inflation.
   The committee later approved the overall bill on a 26-10 vote.
   The defeated surtax would have been the first since such a
revenue-increasing measure was adopted by the government since the
late President Lyndon Johnson used one to finance the Vietnam war.
   Its purpose was to save an estimated $200 billion in interest
costs that taxpayers will have to absorb over the next 30 years by
financing the government's share of the bailout through increased
borrowing.
   ``We've got garbage and none of us wants to carry it out,'' said
Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., who proposed the surtax. ``So what we're
saying is that our children and grandchildren are going to carry it
out. That's just morally and ethically wrong.''
   Gibbons' proposed surtax effectively would have added $150 in
taxes a year for every $10,000 in federal income taxes paid by an
individual, family or company.
   It was defeated on a 10-13 vote after Rep. Frank J. Guarini,
D-N.J., said it would only ``derail everything that's been done''
in view of President Bush's campaign pledge of ``no new taxes.''
   ``I think the train already has left the station,'' Guarini
said, referring to a no-new-tax agreement on the budget approved
Wednesday by the House and up for a vote in the Senate today. ``I'm
not looking for a train wreck at this point.''
   However, the committee reaffirmed its vote last week to make the
bailout part of the federal deficit, defeating Bush's proposal to
finance it through private bond sales in order to make it appear
that the deficit is being reduced.
   The Congressional Budget Office and others have estimated Bush's
plan would cost taxpayers an additional $4.5 billion in interest
costs over the next 30 years than if the money was borrowed
directly from the Treasury.

<HEAD>Sea Level May Be Rising As Ice Caps Melt</HEAD>

   The water in the world's oceans appears to be
rising a tenth of an inch per year, a change that could indicate
that the planet is indeed warming up, a pair of Canadian
researchers reported Thursday.
   Scientists concerned about possible climate warming caused by
the so-called ``Greenhouse '' effect have said that one likely
result would be rising sea levels as the polar ice caps melt.
   But detailed evidence has been lacking, with sea levels
apparently rising in some areas and falling in others.
   Now W.R. Peltier and A.M. Tushingham of the University of
Toronto report in the journal Science that they have calculated an
average sea level rise of 2.4 millimeters annually over the last
century or so. That's about a tenth of an inch per year.
   ``Our analyses should not be construed as proof that global
climate warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect (or some
other uinknown cause) is occurring,'' they cautioned in the journal
published by the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
   ``It would not be surprising, however, if the direct action of
the expected enhancement of the greenhouse effect were first
observed through an indirect response such as an increase in global
sea level,'' they added.
   Overall warming of the waters that cover about three-fourths of
the planet could account for about 25 percent of the rising seas,
since warmer water expands and takes up more space than colder
water, Tushingham and Peltier noted.
   But most of the change seems likely to be a result of melting of
the ice caps on Antarctica and Greenland, they reported.
   Measuring changes in global climate is a complex task and
researchers tend to disagree about the results. Weather varies
considerably from day to day and year to year, making it hard to
detect trends over time.
   For example, while some researchers contend temperature records
show a global warming over the last century, others say that the
apparent rise was caused by city growth around weather stations
raising local readings, or other special circumstances.
   In trying to sort out the sea levels, Peltier and Tushingham
noted that a problem is caused by the fact that the massive sheets
of the last ice age pressed down on land areas in the Northern
Hemisphere.
   Even today, thousands of years later, some land areas continue
to gradually ``rebound'' from that pressure, with the rising land
making coastal tide gauges appear to show falling water.
   The researchers averaged reports from tide gauges around the
world in an effort to filter out local effects such as rising land
levels.
   They then calculated that, on average, sea levels are rising 2.4
millimeters annually, give or take 0.9 millimeter.
   ``The rate of (relative sea level) rise is strongly suggestive
of the action of ongoing glacier and ice sheet melting,'' they
concluded.
   The greenhouse effect has attracted widespread attention
recently, with scientists concerned that if the planet does warm,
droughts will occur, major farming areas will be damaged and other
changes in society will result.
   The term greenhouse effect is used because the increasing levels
of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere allow sunlight
to warm the planet but reduce the amount of balancing warmth
radiated back into space, somewhat in the way a greenhouse traps
warmth inside.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $21.3 million jackpot is awaiting one
lottery ticket holder, and disappointment is in store for countless
others who saw the wrong numbers on TV.
   California's Lotto 6-49 drawing Wednesday night was broadcast
live from Sacramento to the stations that usually carry it. Rather
than break into a Dodgers baseball game, KTTV in Los Angeles
superimposed the numbers.
   Lotto officials said the station told them a technical mixup
caused numbers from the April 12 drawing to appear by mistake. KTTV
interrupted its game broadcast a short time later to give the
correct numbers and explain the error.
   ``We've had calls from people who said they had the winning
number but they tore up their tickets,'' said lottery spokeswoman
Joanne McNabb.
   Those people can file a claim with the lottery security office,
she said.
   Many other callers complained that they mistakenly thought they
had won the jackpot or one of the lesser prizes, which range down
to $5.
   Lottery officials Thursday said only one jackpot-winning ticket
was sold, but they had not yet verified the name of a winner.
   For the record, the numbers were 10, 22, 26, 31, 33, 46, and the
bonus number, 37.

<HEAD>Major Progress Seen in World Trade Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Maryland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More progress has been made in trade
talks among the United States and nearly 100 other countries than
at this stage in any of the previous rounds of talks since World
War II, Arthur Dunkel, head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) said Thursday.
   GATT is an international body based in Geneva, Switzerland, as
well as an accord that embraces nearly 100 countries. It has
sponsored a series of these negotiations, ending with the Tokyo
round completed in 1979. The current Uruguay round is due for
completion next year.
   Dunkel emphasized that member countries will have to negotiate
with others about policies that they have been used to considering
strictly their own business.
   ``Automatic retreat behind the banner of `national sovereignty'
will not be good enough in the future,'' he said.
   These matters include farm policy, ``intellectual property''
rights such as patents and copyright, and treatment of foreign
suppliers of services like banking and air travel.
   ``The new streamlined dispute settlement procedure is now in
place,'' he said.
   GATT's way of settling disputes has been criticized in this
country as slow and ineffective. The new system permits, but does
not require, the use of binding arbitration. It sets up time limits
for a complex process of negotiation and judgment by panels made up
from governments neutral in any given dispute. It makes setting up
such panels easier: in the past, countries accused of an unfair
practice have often been able to block them.
   A new international system of reviewing the trade policies of
individual countries will start in earnest with the United States
this year, Dunkel added. His organization will conduct the reviews,
which could be criticial of national policies.
   He noted that Third World countries are already benefiting from
concessions by the United States and others to encourage the sale
of tropical products that in the past has amounted to $20 billion a
year.
   As a result of a conference last month, the governments have now
agreed on how they plan to negotiate 15 different agreements.
   The most important:
   _Reducing farm subsidies that cost taxpayers and consumers in
the United States and other countries an estimated $120 billion a
year. Former President Reagan asked that the subsidies on
international trade be eliminated by the year 2000, but the
agreement now is to have progressive reductions and no end date has
beeen set.
   _An accord on trade in services, which now provide more jobs and
income than manufacturing in the United States and many other
industrial countries
   _A new system of safeguards to protect a country's own industry
against sudden surges of imports.
   Dunkel spoke at a conference organized by the delegation in
Washington of the European Economic Community.

   Funeral directors deal with grief every
day, so when death takes a holiday _ or morticians hold a
convention _ they do their best to lighten up.
   While many of the meetings cover topics such as ``OSHA
Regulations _ Formaldehyde Content in the Preparation Room,''
there's always time to share a light story.
   ``We've even had a request to put racing stripes on a casket,''
said M.E. Garrett of the Clarksburg Casket Co. ``That may not be
consistent with my sense of taste or yours, but it was important to
the survivors.''
   The casket was for a young man killed in an auto racing
accident. The stripes on the coffin matched those on his car.
   Ray Surface of the Clark Grave Vault Co. said he likes to bring
a gimmick to conventions to break up the crowd. He places a book

   Passersby are stunned by exploding caps that go off when the

   It's time for the annual Critter
Barbecue contest and, as usual, they're having a hard time finding
judges.
   Pork and chicken are at hand for this weekend's cookout, but
there's also a critter category for hunters and their squirrels,
deer, rabbits and ``other.''
   ``Last year we cooked 27 groundhogs,'' said competitor Larry
Anderson. ``We should have won first place, but some of the judges
refused to taste it.''
   The event's organizers are having trouble finding judges willing
to taste everything, said Alice Worrell, an organizer.
   Critters, for purposes of the contest, are defined as anything
that can't be bought in a local grocery store, including alligator,
buffalo and possum.
   Anderson said this year his team, the Mule Skinners, will cook
bear, venison and antelope, but its main entry is a secret.
   ``It's a four-legged creature, and it's prepared by Amish
friends. It'll probably take about five minutes to cook. It can't
lose,'' he said.

   A man forced five children in his care
to smoke crack, held their heads under water and beat them with a
broom and stick, then claimed ``God told him to do it,'' police
said.
   Tony Carter, 36, was jailed on $35,000 bail on charges of
battery and possession of cocaine.
   The children, ages 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11, were in good condition at
Arkansas Children's Hospital, where traces of cocaine were found in
their blood, police said. The children will be placed in foster
care, police said.
   Police spokesman Lt. R.L. ``Bert'' Jenkins said Carter forced
the children to smoke crack. A crack pipe that was still warm and a
small amount of cocaine were found when police burst into Carter's
home Tuesday night, police said.
   Police said Carter beat his three children and two of his
sister's children, then held their heads under dirty water in a
bathtub several times, telling them before each dunking to repent.
   Officers called by a family friend ran into the house after
hearing the children scream, police said.

<HEAD>Steepest Gasoline Price Hike on Record Sends Inflation Rate Skyward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest one-month jump in gasoline prices
since the government began keeping track in the 1930s sent the
overall inflation rate for consumers soaring 0.7 percent in April,
the sharpest advance in more than two years, the government said
Thursday.
   The Labor Department said gasoline prices skyrocketed 11.4
percent in April, following substantial gains of 2.1 percent in
March and 1.7 percent in February.
   Financial markets, noting the heavy influence of the energy
price gains, which are not expected to repeat in the coming months,
shrugged off the bad news. The Dow Jones industrial stock average
slipped 5 points in the first half hour of trading but then quickly
recovered.
   The overall April increase, if it continued for 12 months, would
amount to an annual inflation rate of 8.1 percent. It was the
sharpest climb since an identical 0.7 percent gain in January 1987.
   For the first four months of 1989, inflation was running at an
annual rate of 6.6 percent, half again the 4.4 percent rate posted
for both 1988 and 1987.
   The Bush administration, which is hoping inflation will moderate
and allow the Federal Reserve Board to push down interest rates,
read the report favorably.
   ``We think it's kind of like a bulge moving through the economy.
Other than energy prices, inflation looks like it's in pretty good
shape,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Energy accounted for about 60 percent of the April advance. The
previous monthly record for gasoline was 7.4 percent, hit in
January 1987 and March 1974.
   The department noted, however, that although gasoline prices
have zoomed upward 16.7 percent this year, they were still 17.7
percent below their peak in March 1981 during the OPEC oil crisis.
   The 5.1 percent advance for all energy costs also set a record
and followed a 1.1 percent rise in March. Home heating oil prices
rose 2.2 percent; natural gas and electricity prices were up 0.6
percent.
   Economist S. Jay Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua,
N.Y., said that crude oil prices, which have jumped about 30
percent since the start of the year, have already eased somewhat.
But, that won't necessarily translate immediately into relief for
motorists at the gasoline pump, he said.
   ``Gasoline could very well increase further because of a
shortage of refining capacity and because of an increase in
seasonal demand during the summer,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, the federal Energy Information Administration
projected that gasoline prices, for all grades, would rise by the
summer to an average of $1.09 per gallon from $1.05 currently. The
average price last summer was 99 cents a gallon.
   Food and beverage costs in April rose a moderate 0.5 percent.
Prices for fats and oils, meat and poultry, dairy products, baked
goods and fruits and vegetables all rose. Prices of sugar and
sweets fell a slight 0.1 percent.
   Levy said food prices were no longer being influenced by last
year's drought, but he said it was too soon to tell if this year's
growing conditions will be favorable enough to bring food prices
down.
   The rate of inflation excluding the volatile food and energy
areas, a calculation analysts say is often a better measure of
underlying inflationary pressures than the broader index, rose only
0.2 percent in April. The annualized rate for this ``core''
inflation from February through April was 4.2 percent, down from a
4.9 percent in the preceding six months.
   Economist Lawrence A. Hunter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
said the report ``should be clear and convincing evidence to the
Fed that the time has come to ease interest rates.''
   But economist Michael Moran of Daiwa Securities America Inc.
said that, while the Fed may read the report positively, it will
not interpret it as a signal to ease credit restraints.
   ``They need to keep a firm grip on policy or the secondary
effects of energy prices could become important,'' he said. ``Many
items consume energy in their production process. And the overall
(consumer) index (including energy) is the basis for many
cost-of-living increases,'' including those in Social Security
benefits.
   The April figures left the overall Consumer Price Index at 123.1
percent of its 1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selection
of goods costing $100 during the base period would have cost
$123.10 in April, 80 cents more than in March.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 1.2
percent in April after falling 0.3 percent a month earlier.
   Average weekly earnings in April, before adjusting for
inflation, were $334.08, up 4.3 percent from a year earlier. Taking
the 5.3 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over
the 12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 0.9 percent.
   The Labor Department offered these other details on price
changes in April:
   _Apparel prices rose a modest 0.3 percent after jumping 1.4
percent a month earlier. Early spring sales of women's clothing
somewhat offset the normal price increases at the start of a season.
   _Medical care costs were up 0.5 percent, the same as in March.
   _Entertainment prices climbed 0.6 percent, double the March rate
of 0.3 percent.
   _Transportation costs, reflecting gasoline hikes, rose 2.1
percent, the sharpest in nearly seven years. New car prices rose a
slight 0.1 percent, reflecting manufacturers' incentives to bolster
lagging sales; used car prices fell 0.3 percent.
   _The cost of services climbed a modest 0.2 percent in April even
though the labor market remains tight. The moderate increase came
despite a 0.9 percent hike for the cost of telephone services,
reflecting a nationwide increase in line access charges.

   Hedda Nussbaum, the battered woman who testified
against Joel Steinberg in the death of their illegally adopted
6-year-old daughter, has been released from a psychiatric hospital
and moved to an apartment.
   One of Nussbaum's lawyers, Betty Levinson, was quoted in
Thursday's Daily News as saying Nussbaum was discharged from Four
Winds Psychiatric Hospital in Katonah several weeks ago.
   Nussbaum is in outpatient therapy and also attends weekly
meetings of a support group for battered women, Levinson said.
   Steinberg, Nussbaum's former live-in lover, was convicted
earlier this year of manslaughter and sentenced to up to 25 years
in prison in Lisa's death.
   The child was found beaten unconscious in the couple's Greenwich
Village apartment and died three days later.
   Charges against Nussbaum were dropped after prosecutors
concluded that she had been so severely beaten by Steinberg that
she was unable to aid the child.
   Nussbaum, a former children's book editor, is on disability
insurance until she finds a job, Levinson said. She has also filed
a $3 million suit against Steinberg and sold the TV rights to her
story, reportedly for $100,000.

   A judge today refused to stay the execution
of a murderer who is scheduled to die tonight in Georgia's electric
chair.
   Henry Willis III, 36, was sentenced to death for his part in the
Feb. 11, 1976, killing of Ray City Police Chief Ed Giddens.
   Superior Court Judge Hal Craig today denied Willis' request for
a stay of execution. His attorney, Millard Farmer, said he was
preparing an appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.
   The state board of Pardons and Paroles also scheduled a clemency
hearing on Willis' case in Atlanta.
   Giddens was 29 when he was abducted and killed after he stopped
a car matching the description of one wanted in a robbery. He had
resigned and was one day away from moving to Florida to manage a
citrus farm.
   Giddens was taken to a Lanier County swamp in southern Georgia
where he was shot when he ran from his abductors. He was shot again
at close range in the face and thrown into the swamp, according to
trial testimony.
   A friend of Giddens, Robert Swanson, now Alapaha chief of
police, was in the swamp when Giddens' body was found.
   ``It was coldblooded murder,'' Swanson said Wednesday. ``A man's
last night on the force, he has two little boys, he begged for his
life, and they killed him. ... Henry Willis will get what is coming
to him.''
   Willis was one of three people tried in connection with Giddens'
death. Son Fleming is on death row and Larry Fleming, Son's nephew,
was sentenced to life in prison.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in February refused to hear Willis'
appeal on grounds that automatic challenges to exclude blacks from
the jury that heard his case violated his right to a trial by his
peers.
   The court in 1986 barred prosecutors from using such jury
strikes to exclude jurors on the basis of race, but the ruling was
not made retroactive.
   Willis was raised by his paternal grandmother, Ruthie Willis,
who said she does not have the money to bury him.
   ``If he done that, I think he should die because the Bible says
`He that kill, shall be killed,''' she said. ``It's hurtin' me all
over.''

   More rain fell today in the saturated South after
deadly storms unleashed more than 20 tornadoes across Texas,
shattering one town and forcing hundreds to leave their homes in
low-lying areas.
   One tornado killed a woman, and four people were swept to their
deaths in swollen creeks. The body of the fifth victim, a
12-year-old boy, was found in a creek west of Ennis today. Fifty
people suffered storm-related injuries.
   Thunderstorms lingered over southeastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma
and western Louisiana this morning. Rain was forecast for today
from the Mississippi Valley across eastern parts of the Central
Plains, Oklahoma, eastern Texas, western Mississippi, western
Tennessee, western Kentucky, Illinois and Wisconsin.
   Although the severity of the thunderstorms over Texas lessened
this morning, new flash flood watches and warnings and some tornado
watches were posted throughout the state because of the likelihood
of more rain, especially in the Houston area. A tornado briefly
touched down in Houston today, but there were no immediate reports
of damage.
   Elsewhere, the low pressure system that brought persistent rains
to the Northeast moved out to sea on Wednesday. But at least 100
families in northern New Jersey remained in emergency shelters as
they waited for the Passaic River to crest today about two feet
above flood level.
   A predawn tornado Wednesday ravaged the small Texas town of
Jarrell, killing a woman who had been asleep in her mobile home.
The twister roared through the town of 1,000 people 40 miles from
Austin, demolishing 33 houses, 12 mobile homes and 16 businesses,
said David Barham of the state's emergency management office.
   Thirty-nine homes were damaged, along with the school gym roof.
   The tornado sheared utility poles, pulled down power lines,
uprooted trees, overturned several cars and trucks, including six
tractor-trailers on an interstate and spread debris along a
seven-mile path, authorities said.
   About two dozen people were injured and treated at hospitals.
   ``I heard a bolt of lightning and it wasn't more than five
minutes before all hell broke loose,'' said W.G. Schurhammer, whose
apartment house was damaged. ``By the time I heard it, I dove for
the corner and the windows broke.''
   A tornado Wednesday afternoon cut a quarter-mile-wide swath for
as much as 30 miles through east Texas, destroying homes and
injuring at least nine people. A twister near Houston injured eight
people, authorities said.
   Another twister touched down six miles northwest of Lufkin,
destroying eight homes in Allentown, said Angelina County sheriff's
officers. At least nine people were injured, they said.
   On Wednesday, flooding forced hundreds of Dallas-Fort Worth area
residents to leave their homes. Floodwaters caused a levee failure
along the Trinity River in Dallas and rising tributaries were
forcing more evacuations today.
   ``You could hear the roar of the creek right behind our
trailers,'' said Don Reiter, who escaped high water Wednesday in
Kennedale. ``We didn't take anything because it came so fast. Our
cars are gone, our boats are gone. What we have on our back is just
what we have.''
   In south Dallas, a car driven by a 56-year-old woman stalled as
she tried to cross a bridge. Firefighters barricading the bridge
urged her not to attempt the crossing, said firefighter Dennis
Ground.
   Ground said the woman scrambled to the top of the car and was
told to stay there. But ``the water got so rough it just knocked
the car off. Whether she had been in it or on top of it, it still
would have occurred,'' Ground said.
   The body of 73-year-old Grand Prairie man was found in his
truck, which had been swept into a flooded creek branch. A man was
killed when his car was swept into McAnear Creek south of Fort
Worth.
   Rescuers plucked people from yards, trees and car tops. The
pilot of a radio station helicopter pulled two girls and their
mother from the roof of their car just before it was swept away in
a rain-swollen creek in Cleburne.
   Of the six emergency shelters opened by the Dallas Red Cross
Wedenesday, only two remained open this morning, said spokeswoman
Sandra Pomeroy. She didn't know how many people were in the
shelters, but said, ``We served 150 breakfasts today. We served 200
dinners last night and yesterday we served 300 lunches.''
   Bobby Valentine, manager of the Texas Rangers baseball team,
sought help from a radio station helicopter to reach two of his
horses that were trapped by rising waters behind his Fort Worth
home.
   He was able to lead the horses to safety, but his son's pony
drowned.
   ``It was something, jumping off the helicopter into water
waist-deep,'' Valentine said.
   In some parts of the state, more than 6 inches of rain fell,
boosting monthly precipitation totals already far above average.
The Dallas-Fort Worth area has received 9.62 inches of rain for the
month. The area average is 4.5 inches and the record for May is
13.66 inches.

<HEAD>INF Treaty Leaves Costly Bases Without a Purpose</HEAD>

   Lawmakers clashed Thursday with Pentagon
officials over plans for costly European bases left without a
purpose by the INF treaty and the future role of about 15,000
troops there.
   ``The Pentagon has a sizable credibility gap,'' said Rep. Andy
Ireland, R-Fla., who wondered whether the Defense Department might
create some mission simply to use the six ground-launched cruise
missile and three Pershing 2 operating bases left open with the
signing of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The U.S.-Soviet pact eliminated intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.
   Republicans and Democrats on the House Armed Services
subcommittee on military installations and facilities questioned
what the Pentagon plans to do with the bases, which cost the United
States $394 million to construct and $67 million in family housing.
NATO spent $312 million on the bases.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the
subcommittee, asked whether the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, which
Spain demanded leave the base at Torrejon de Ardoz, could be
relocated to one of the INF bases.
   The United States plans to move the wing to Crotone, Italy,
where construction of a new base is expected to cost NATO more than
$800 million, with the United States paying $26 million for
construction.
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., emphasized that lawmakers do not
want to see the bases go unused, and reminded Pentagon officials
that the nation cannot afford to construct a new base at Crotone.
   ``We remember the birthing of the ground-launched cruise missile
bases,'' said Dickinson, who listed all the facilities that had to
be built on the base, including schools, commissaries and chapels.
   ``We can't start from scratch again,'' Dickinson said. ``The
money is just not there. ... Why can't we have some alternative
use.''
   John A. Woodworth, deputy assistant secretary of defense for
international security policy, said U.S. officials are studying
ways to make the most efficient use of the bases.
   He also sought to assure Ireland that Pentagon officials aren't
making up possible missions for the bases.
   ``I don't think the objective is to tell people in the field to
develop uses of these bases so we have a good story,'' Woodworth
said.
   Committee members also questioned why the 15,000 troops assigned
to operate the facilities could not return home. Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney has proposed in the fiscal 1990 budget bringing back
about 4,000 troops from Europe and replacing a brigade at Fort
Carson, Colo., with National Guard reserves.
   Woodworth said that by the end of fiscal 1991, the number of
``personnel spaces'' in Europe to support the Pershings will be
reduced by 5,685 from the total of 14,562.
   The remaining personnel will be used for air base ground
defense, medical war readiness and upgrade of an undermanned combat
support and service unit, Woodworth said.
   But Schroeder complained that instead of taking troops from
Europe, the Pentagon plans to cut the brigade in her home state,
and Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, said leaving a high number of
troops in Europe would not save taxpayers' dollars.
   Ireland, who has introduced a resolution to reassign civilian
and military personnel associated with INF to the United States,
said that ``unless we bring our extensive alliance commitments into
line with contemporary fiscal reality, we could set ourselves on
the road to ruin that has brought down so many great powers before
us.''

<HEAD>For Ronald Reagan, They Want a Profile in Granite</HEAD>

   Some admirers, convinced Ronald Reagan's place
in history will be monumental, think the place for a monument to
him is amid the greats on Mount Rushmore.
   But Tom Griffith, executive secretary of the Mount Rushmore
Society in Rapid City, S.D., suggests they have rocks in their
heads.
   ``Why fool with a masterpiece?'' asks Griffith. ``Would you
paint another figure next to the Mona Lisa?''
   The idea of adding Reagan to Mount Rushmore was advanced in 1984
by Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., then Republican national chairman. But its
current champion is R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor of the American
Spectator, a monthly conservative review.
   He says Reagan earned a place on the mountaintop, beside
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, because ``he
brought peace and prosperity to a country riven by fear.''
   He sounds half serious _ and half not-so-serious _ but he says
he did raise the idea with Reagan over dinner last July.
   Reagan ``smiled,'' he said.
   Ever since word got out, Tyrrell said, he has been dogged by
``the maniacs in favor and the maniacs against.''
   Out of ecological consideration, he said, he'd be willing to
cast a concrete Reagan nose and chin and an ear or two and
helicopter them in, keeping blasting on the mountain to a minimum.
Washington's head has a serious crack, and no one wants to make
that worse.
   Also promoting the idea is Young Americans for Freedom, which
sent out an add-Reagan-to-Rushmore ballot in 23,000 fund-raising
letters. The results will be counted in June, said Tom Lizardo, YAF
executive director, and if the response is an enthusiastic
go-for-it, YAF may petition the Interior Department.
   ``It won't happen,'' says Griffith, whose organization raised
the original $1 million required for 360 workmen to dynamite and
drill the visages of the four presidents into a granite cliff in
the Black Hills of South Dakota between 1927 and 1941.
   The faces are the largest carved figures anywhere. Washington's
is as high as a five-story building, bigger than any sphinx in
Egypt.
   ``The simple fact is there is no more suitable rock to carve
anyone at Mount Rushmore,'' Griffith said.
   Tyrrell argues that surely Reagan could be tucked in on
Washington's right side, or between Roosevelt and Lincoln.
   As for the cost, he'd have the people of South Dakota handle
that.
   ``It's going to be their tourist trap,'' he said, ``and they
ought to pay for it.''

<HEAD>Boy's Skull Reattached to Spine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Surgeons reattached a 10-year-old boy's skull to
his spine after his head was nearly pulled off in a bicycle
accident.
   Doctors said they are confident Timothy Mathias of Glendale will
regain most of his faculties and walk out of the hospital. He was
listed in serious but stable condition Thursday at St. Joseph's
Hospital and Medical Center.
   The rare, five-hour operation, performed April 26 at Barrow
Neurological Institute on the hospital grounds, was made even more
difficult by the presence of a golf ball-size blood clot at the top
of the spinal column, doctors said.
   ``He's an absolute miracle child. By all rights, he should be
dead,'' said Barrow Medical Director Robert Spetzler.
   Timmy was on his way to school April 21 when he rode his bicycle
into the path of a pickup. He was dragged about 15 feet and his
skull was pulled away from his neck vertebrae. Only muscle and
ligaments held his head onto his spine.
   Kerry Mathias, the boy's mother, said, ``I was told he had only
a 5 percent chance of surviving the operation. It's miraculous that
they were able to do all this work in one shot.''
   Surgeons said only 18 similar trauma cases have been recorded.
Twelve survived, but none of the cases involved blood clots.
   Timmy can move his left side and is beginning to move the right
side of his body. Although nerve tissue cannot regenerate, doctors
say that the nerves may form new connections to compensate for
damaged neural pathways.
   ``He may walk with a limp, but months down the line he will be
walking,'' said Dr. Harold Rekate, chief of pediatric neurosurgery.
   Spetzler said emergency medical technicians saved the child's
life by recognizing the severity of his injuries and taping him to
a board to immobilize him.
   ``One millimeter movement of the boy's head in relation to his
spinal column would have been fatal,'' Spetzler said.
   Spetzler said the six-surgeon team discovered the massive blood
clot, just above the back of the throat, only because they used an
experimental low-strength magnetic resonance imager to scan for
injuries.
   A normal imager could not be used because the boy's metal
life-support system would have interfered with the magnetic field
used to generate images.
   The clot was drained through an incision at the neck. Doctors
said the boy would have died if the clot had not been discovered
before the reattachment.
   Dr. Volker Sonntag, director of the spinal cord injury unit at
Barrow, said he then inserted a 6-inch, U-shaped steel brace to
hold the skull in place.
   The brace, covered with bone marrow from Timmy's hip, will
remain in his head and restrict rotation about 50 percent. Doctors
expect the marrow to harden and cover the brace.

<HEAD>Leahy Threatens Action if Standards Lessened</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee said Thursday that an Agriculture Department proposal to
streamline meat inspections should be ``sent back totally to the
drawing board'' and predicted that Congress would overturn a
lessening of the federal standards.
   ``If producers of food have learned anything from the Alar and
other scares the last two months, (it is that) this is not the time
to do anything to give the suggestion of less safety in food,''
Leahy said.
   He commented a day after consumer and labor organizations
charged that a streamlined inspection system proposed by the
department for cattle carcasses at packing houses could result in
more contamination of the beef supply.
   Under the proposal, federal inspectors at 40 to 50 of the
largest slaughter plants, accounting for about 80 percent of the
nation's beef, would rely more on company workers to keep hair,
mud, excreta and other contaminants from the beef supply.
   One result would be to speed up the lines of carcasses moving
along the inspection route, leaving inspectors less time to check
for abcesses, tumors and other abnormalities.
   Leahy said that the nation's food supply is now safe, but that
if the Agriculture Department ``takes this step, I'm not sure we
can guarantee it.''
   The chairman said in a telephone interview that, in his 15 years
in the Senate, he had never seen a time when ``people are more
concerned about food safety than they are now. For decent
inspection of all types, people are willing to pay the tiny amount
extra that it costs.''
   Leahy said he has been pressing the Agriculture Department for
more than two years to make changes in its meat and poultry
inspection system and to modify some of the proposals it has under
consideration.
   If changes aren't made by the department, he said, ``Congress is
going to do it legislatively'' when it writes the 1990 farm bill.
   Department officials say they won't decide whether to proceed
with the proposed revisions in packing house inspection standards
until they review public comments, which have been coming in since
the proposal was made in December.
   The meatpacking industry, led by the American Meat Institute,
wants the plan reviewed by a scientific panel before it is finally
approved to ensure that meat safety would not be diminished.
   A separate but equally controversial department proposal
announced last November would reduce the number of federal
inspectors at plants that turn out chicken soup, hot dogs and other
processed meat and poultry items.
   One goal of this ``risk-based'' system would be to use computers
and other technology to replace some of the day-by-day surveillance
by federal inspectors in processing plants with good records.
   The proposed program would ease up on ``good'' plants and allow
a certain degree of self-policing. But those with poor inspection
records would be subject to closer supervision.
   Leahy said both proposals ``ought to be withdrawn and sent back
totally to the drawing boards,'' although adding that some aspects
of each may make a lot of sense and perhaps should be reconsidered.
   Have the Agriculture Department and Secretary Clayton Yeutter
gotten Leahy's message?
   ``I hope they have,'' he said. ``Because, administratively, the
department could take all the steps necessary to assure safety and
quality. If they are unwilling to do it administratively, then I
can guarantee the Congress is going to do it legislatively.''

   China's state-controlled media gave unprecedented
coverage Thursday to students and workers demonstrating for
democratic reform.
   The reporting was astonishing in its frankness, speed and clear
sympathy with protesters for the heavily censored press.
   ``One Million From All Walks of Life Demonstrate in Support of
Hunger-Striking Students,'' read the banner headline on the
People's Daily, the official organ of the Communist Party.
   Protests since mid-April have gone largely unreported, and many
Chinese relied on Western media coverage for accurate accounts.
   ``Large-scale Demonstrations in More Than 20 Cities
Nationwide,'' read the headline in the Guangming Daily. It was one
of seven front-page stories on the protests.
   ``The condition of the students and the future of the country
touched the heart of every Chinese who has a conscience,'' the
newspaper said.
   Chinese were hungry for news of the democracy movement.
   ``There is no free press, and that breeds corruption,'' said Xue
Yong, a novelist from Hebei province at Tiananmen on Thursday.
``It's only in the last couple of days that we've seen fairly
objective reporting. That's the great sorrow of China's media.''
   ``We depend a great deal on the foreign press. We don't trust
the Chinese media,'' said a worker at a chemical factory.
   It would have been hard for newspapers to ignore the story.
   More than 1 million people swarmed into the streets of the
capital Wednesday to call for democracy. It was largest show of
public defiance in 40 years of communist rule.
   Of six articles on the front page of the People's Daily, five
were about the demonstrations. Only a small bottom corner was
devoted to the historic visit to China by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   The student protests began with the April 15 death of Hu
Yaobang, an ousted Communist Party chief who pushed for democratic
reforms. But the first sympathetic coverage came only on April 23,
after journalists at the daily Science and Technology News
threatened to quit.
   And it wasn't until this week that many newspapers followed suit.
   When more than 3,000 students began a hunger strike on Saturday,
a press emboldened by the Science and Technology News' article
began Western-like coverage. Newspapers carried accurate and fairly
complete accounts of events and details of the students demands,
including a free press.
   Electronic media, though slower, have also picked up on the
trend.
   Beijing TV interrupted programming four times Thursday with news
updates on the demonstrations. China Central Television's evening
news showed leaders visiting hunger strikers in a hospital.
   Newscasters read letters from viewers calling for authorities to
agree to meet with the fasters.

   An argument over subsidized flour ended
in shelling that killed one civilian and wounded five Thursday in a
Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Sidon in south
Lebanon, police reported.
   Police in the ancient port 25 miles south of Beirut said two
155mm shells were fired from positions manned by the South Lebanon
Army militia in nearby Jezzine and landed at the edge of the Ein
el-Hilweh camp.
   The Sunni Nasserite militia that controls Sidon said earlier it
had gone on alert because the militia threatened to shell the city
if its border enclave did not receive a share of
government-subsidized flour being unloaded at the port.
   Israel sponsors the South Lebanon Army, a predominantly
Christian militia that helps patrol a ``security zone'' north of
the border. Israel established the zone, ranging in depth from six
to 10 miles, when most of its soldiers withdrew in June 1985 after
a three-year occupation.
   A statement from the Nasserite militia said the zone's share of
flour was ``ready and waiting for someone to come and receive it.
It is the share of the Lebanese people in the enclave, which the
Lebanese government has bought. We never tried to deny the Lebanese
people its food.''
   About 225,000 people live in the zone, including 25,000 who have
fled south since March 8, when an artillery war began in Beirut
between a Syrian-Druse alliance and Christian army units led by
Gen. Michele Aoun.
   Shortages of flour, fuel and other supplies have developed since
the Beirut port was closed by the shelling.
   East Germany said it was closing its embassy in Beirut
temporarily and withdrawing the staff because the building had
suffered heavy shelling damage. A dispatch from Berlin by the
official East German news agency ADN did not say how many people
were involved.
   In Beirut, leaders of the Lebanon's 900,000 Sunni Moslem said a
senior aide to Sheik Hassan Khaled, the slain grand mufti, would
carry out his duties until a new spiritual leader was elected. They
did not set a date for the election.
   Sheik Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, the 46-year-old aide, has been in
charge of Khaled's office. The mufti and 21 other people were
killed by a car bomb Tuesday in Moslem west Beirut.
   Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi met with Lebanese leaders on
how to consolidate a cease-fire in the artillery battle.
   ``All sides have assured me that the cease-fire will continue,''
he said. The truce was called a week ago.
   Syrian gunners and the Druse militiamen of Walid Jumblatt have
continued shelling the Christian coastline north of Beirut to
prevent Aoun from receiving weapons and ammunition by sea.
   A police spokesman said 20 rockets and howitzer shells fired
from west Beirut, where Syrian troops are stationed, hit the
Christian coastal area Thursday. No casualties were reported.
   He said there was no response from Aoun's gunners in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of Beirut.
   By police count, 359 people have been killed and 1,393 wounded
since the shooting started two days after Aoun's forces blockaded
illegal ports operated by Moslem militias.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, a year after the Lebanese
civil war began, and has become the nation's main power broker.
   Violations of the truce have prevented deployment of 321
military observers from six Arab nations under terms of the
cease-fire agreement.
   After conferring in Christian east Beirut with Nasrallah Sfeir,
the Maronite Catholic patriarch, Ibrahimi said he hoped next week's
Arab summit in Morocco would ``consolidate the truce by adopting
the appropriate resolutions.'' He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Inner City Students Graduate From College With Help From Boston Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years ago, Boston businesses raised $5.5
million to ensure that no student in the city's public schools
would be denied a college education for lack of money.
   Now, the first group of students supported by the scholarship
and counseling program, named Access, is finishing college _ at a
graduation rate nearly three times the national average for
inner-city youth.
   ``The idea was to keep them from dropping out of high school.
Now it turns out the program also has the wonderful effect of
keeping them in college,'' said Edward E. Phillips, chairman of The
New England, an insurance and financial services firm.
   From 99 students receiving about $50,000 in the 1985-86 school
year, the scholarship program has grown to 335 students receiving
$282,000 this year.
   Similar programs have been created in Dayton, Ohio; Dade County,
Fla.; Wake City, N.C.; Alexandria, Va., and other school districts.
   Among the first graduates is Cindy Sealey, an education major at
Emmanuel College in Boston. She cried softly at a news conference
Thursday when the city's school superintendent handed her a
surprise: a letter promising a teaching job in the fall.
   Business leaders on Thursday called attention to one statistic
in particular: of the original 99 students who received
scholarships, 79 have graduated or are expected to graduate from
college.
   ``That represents an anticipated graduation rate 50 percent
higher than for all college students nationally, and nearly three
times higher than the rate of inner city youth who enter college,''
said Phillips, program chairman and chief fund-raiser.
   The program pays for six full-time counselors who help students
obtain funding from various sources, including state and federal
grants, college scholarships and financial aid, work-study funds
and guaranteed student loans.
   Then, after those sources have been exhausted, the business
group provides ``last-dollar'' scholarships to make up the
difference between the cost of college and what the students and
their families can afford.
   Throughout their college years, the students can contact Access
counselors for financial, personal or academic advice.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said he believes the counseling is as
important as the money. ``It seems to me that what we have here is
an idea that ... can work for young people all over the United
States of America,'' he said.
   M. Derek Thomas, a burly ex-running back who once dreamed of a
career in professional sports, said the program allowed him to go
to Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., where he will receive
a diploma next week.
   ``I played sports in high school, but my mother always told me
to have something to fall back on, which was an education,'' he
said.
   ``Before college, I worked and worked to save money, but
out-of-state tuition at Rutgers was about $9,000 at that time, and
I couldn't have swung it without help.''

   In a diplomatic compromise accepted by both
the United States and Panama, the Organization of American States
called for a transfer of power through democratic means in Panama
while leaving the details to a team of mediators.
   The plan was unanimously authorized late Wednesday by OAS
foreign ministers in a resolution that condemns the ``grave events
and abuses'' by Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but
which also stops short of criticizing his government.
   The resolution, approved in an unusually efficient manner by the
29 delegates present, was sufficiently ambiguous to win the
approval of the two biggest antagonists at the session: Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge
Ritter.
   Baker pronounced himself ``very pleased'' with the outcome.
Ritter said, ``I feel fully satisfied.''
   President Bush, responding to a question shouted by a reporter
as he headed from the Oval Office to a helicopter this morning,
called the OAS action a ``good resolution.'' Bush left for a
four-day trip to New York, Boston and Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The president's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, later told
journalists on Air Force One that the resolution ``constitutes a
condemnation of Noriega by name for his abuses of the electoral
process.'' He added: ``We're gratified that the OAS countries
shared the United States' position.''
   The key provision empowers the foreign ministers of Ecuador,
Guatemala and Trinidad to try to promote a ``national accord,
within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest period possible,
to ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign
will of Panamanian people.''
   OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares was asked to assist the
delegation that will travel to the Central American nation. The
organization issued a statement this afternoon saying the envoys
will depart Monday. They were asked to report back by June 5, and
the resolution said unspecified ``subsequent measures'' may be
needed after June 5.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, speaking today from
Caracas on ``CBS This Morning,'' called the OAS meeting ``the
inauguration of new relations between the United States and the
rest of the hemisphere because we have all agreed on a declaration
defending democracy for Latin America and we have all condemned the
abuses commited in Panama....''
   Noriega is expected to tell the envoys that he never has opposed
the fundamental purpose of the resolution _ a transfer of power
through democratic means. He is likely to claim the May 7
presidential elections, which he later ordered voided, were
designed to achieve that very goal.
   The most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a
direct reference to Noriega was appropriate.
   The initial draft of the resolution, prepared by a 10-nation
delegation, omitted any reference to Noriega but the United States
and other countries strongly opposed to Noriega reversed that
omission during a closed session of more than two hours, paving the
way for final approval.
   The new language warned that the ``grave events and abuses'' by
Noriega ``could unleash an escalation of violence'' in Panama.
   The decision to include the reference to Noriega was approved by
a 20-2 vote with seven delegates abstaining. The Panamanian and
Nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording while the
abstainers were from Peru, Uruguay and five Caribbean countries.
   The Nicaraguan delegate failed in two efforts to win approval of
amendments assailing President Bush's decision last week to send
2,000 more U.S. troops to Panama. Bush's stated purpose was to
protect American lives.
   Ritter expressed satisfaction with the final resolution, saying
it fell far short of the U.S. demand for a condemnation of the
Panamanian government. He promised that the OAS delegation would be
welcomed by Panamanian authorities.
   Noriega's critics have maintained he first tried to rig the
outcome of the May 7 election in support of his candidate, Carlos
Duque, then ordered the returns voided when he could no longer
conceal the fraud. Government agents severely beat at least two
opposition candidates, a point noted in the resolution.
   Sen. Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who went to Panama as
an observer for the election, attended the meeting at OAS
headquarters and termed the final resolution ``very positive'' but
said he would have preferred an explicit demand that Noriega step
down.
   The resolution marks a return to a key diplomatic assignment for
Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, a member of the
mediating team. Cordovez was the principal negotiator for the
agreement that led to the withdrawal of Soviet forces from
Afghanistan.
   In contrast to other OAS foreign ministers meetings, this one
was short on rhetoric and stressed substantive give-and-take.
   Baena Soares had predicted Wednesday morning the session could
drag on until Friday but the resolution was in its final form and
approved by consensus at 11:50 p.m., barely six hours after the
formal proceeding had got under way.

   One-fourth of the Soviet Union's ruling
Politburo, including Mikhail S. Gorbachev, got stuck in an elevator
Thursday while they were on their way to an elevator factory.
   Gorbachev, his wife, Raisa, and two of his closest advisers,
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Alexander Yakovlev,
left a fifth-floor briefing on the operations of the Minhang
Economic and Technological Development Zone and were escorted to a
waiting elevator.
   A moment later, the lift's door opened on the same floor, and
Shevardnadze stepped out. It closed and reopened, and Yakovlev got
out. Then the Gorbachevs and their bodyguards.
   ``Too heavy,'' suggested a reporter.
   ``No,'' replied Gorbachev. ``It's your Western technology.''
   The Soviet president and his entourage then went to visit the
Shanghai Mitsubishi Elevator Co. Ltd., a joint venture between
Chinese and Japanese manufacturing firms.
   Gorbachev, who left a short time later for Moscow ending a
four-day trip to China, is seeking to encourage Soviet enterprises
to modernize by taking in foreign partners in joint ventures
similar to those that have enjoyed success in China.

   The State Department praised Greek and Turkish
forces on Thursday for implementing a disengagement agreement in
Cyprus this week.
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot forces abandoned 24 military positions
along a line dividing Nicosia, capital of the east Mediterranean
island.
   The disengagement agreement, brokered by the U.N. peacekeeping
force based on the island since 1964, was aimed at reducing tension
along the buffer zone that runs through the old, walled section of
the city.
   ``This represents an important practical step towards
alleviating tensions and averting incidents. It is a measure which
we strongly supported,'' said State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher.
   ``We congratulate the parties concerned and the United Nations
which worked with them to bring about this success. This
deconfrontation agreement is the product of leadership and of
vision,'' he said.
   Boucher added that the United States hopes implementation of the
initial phase of the agreement will enable progress on resolving
the fundamental dispute over control of the island.
   Cyprus has been divided since July 1974, when the Turkish Army
invaded after a short-lived coup by militant supporters of union
with Greece.
   The Turks seized the northern one-third of the island. The
minority Turkish Cypriots, who make up 18 percent of the 650,000
population, declared a breakaway republic there in 1983.

   A top higher education official called
Thursday for an end to athletic scholarships and shorter football,
basketball and baseball seasons as reforms needed to correct
``fundamental, systemic problems'' in intercollegiate sports.
   Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on
Education, the umbrella organization for the nation's colleges and
universities, told Congress that the scandals afflicting big-time
sports programs are not so much isolated cases as they are symptoms
of a ``basically unhealthy'' enterprise.
   In testimony to a House Education and Labor subcommittee, Atwell
also proposed the elimination of freshman eligibility in football
and basketball, and the equal sharing among all schools of the
television revenues now monopolized by the powerhouses.
   ``First and foremost,'' said Atwell, ``we must try to break the
insidious connection between money and winning'' in big-time
college sports.
   Atwell was among several academic, media and sports federation
officials who testified before the and Labor subcommittee on
problems afflicting collegiate sports programs.
   Frank Deford, former senior editor for Sports Illustrated,
declared that ``big-time college athletics has always been a
scandal and always will be, unless major changes are made. It is a
professional game which poses as amateur; a big business which uses
free labor.''
   Deford rejected arguments that revenues generated by glamour
sports benefits higher education as a whole. ``Rarely,'' he said,
``does any money raised for big-time athletics leave the athletic
department to enhance the university community.''
   Atwell, who said his proposals were his own and not those of the
council's member institutions, said ``there is a major set of
systemic problems that must be addressed if we in higher education
are serious about restoring public confidence in intercollegiate
athletics. ...''
   ``Some elements of the problem include an over-emphasis on
winning at the expense of other values; an over-concern with
spectator sports and spectator facilities as opposed to better
facilities for, and more emphasis on, participation in lifelong
fitness activities,'' he said.
   Atwell faulted the news media for bestowing lavish attention
upon big-time college sports ``while giving short shrift to
virtually everything else.''
   He lauded the National Collegiate Athletic Association for
recent enforcement actions and stiffened eligibility requirements.
``But the fact remains that too many programs and too many coaches
still care more about eligibility than education,'' he said.
   Dick Schultz, executive director of the NCAA, said ``I'm not
here to tell you there are not problems,'' ranging from drug abuse
to academic and monetary cheating. ``But the NCAA has not been
sitting idly by,'' he added.
   Jeff Farris, executive director of the National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics, noted that all member institutions in
the NAIA are required to conduct drug education programs and are
barred from accepting gifts from makers of alcohol and tobacco
products.
   Atwell said all college basketball games should be played after
Christmas and before March 15, and declared that any more than 85
baseball games ``is simply incompatible with the student-athlete
ideal.'' He did not specify how much he would shorten the football
season, but said ``the notion of a postseason college football
playoff, now being explored by the College Football Association, is
a perfectly awful idea.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., testified before the panel in behalf
of his legislation to require college recruiters to disclose to
high-school prospects, and the public at large, their record for
graduating student athletes, broken down by sport, race and sex.
   Bradley cited a recent USA Today survey which found that
Division 1 basketball players, for example, graduate at a rate of
only 17 percent. ``The challenge of a college experience,'' said
Bradley, a former All-America and NBA pro, ``should not be `making
the team,' but preparing to be a good citizen, friend and family
member.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel Pushing Ahead With Judge Candidate Despite Cranston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A San Francisco attorney will remain under
Senate consideration as a federal judge despite a thumbs down from
home-state Sen. Alan Cranston, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee said Thursday.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said Cranston has submitted a
negative ``blue slip'' on the nomination of Vaughn Walker, which
under the customs that once prevailed within the Senate would have
been sufficient to put an immediate end to the lawyer's candidacy
for the bench.
   But Biden said, ``I have no desire to hold up'' Walker.
   Still, Biden said the opposition from Cranston ``will affect
Walker negatively.'' And the nomination was held back Thursday as
the committee sent all other current judicial nominees to the full
Senate with favorable recommendations.
   Cranston, D-Calif., has sought to sidetrack Walker's nomination
to the U.S. District Court, saying that last year before the
committee Walker went too far in defending a private club that has
been alleged to discriminate against women and that he was too slow
to resign from membership.
   California's other senator, Republican Pete Wilson, has urged
confirmation of Walker.
   According to Biden, the custom of allowing a single member of
the Judiciary Committee to kill a judicial nomination ended when
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., became chairman.
   Biden said that under his own chairmanship one negative ``blue
slip'' from a home-state senator could veto a candidate only if the
administration had failed to consult with senators before making
the nomination.
   He said such consultation would have to be serious. ``If it's
perfunctory, there's going to be a problem,'' Biden said.
   The nominations sent to the full Senate were those of Pamela Ann
Rhymer of Los Angeles and Ferdinand F. Fernandez as judges of the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Robert C. Bonner of Pasadena,
Calif., as a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California and Melinda F. Harmon of Houston as a judge
of the District Court for the Southern District of Texas.
   Biden said it was unclear when Walker would get a new hearing.
He said questions had been raised by the committee staff and he had
not reviewed them to determine if they were worth pursuing at the
cost of further delay.
   Walker was a member of San Francisco's Olympic Club until Feb.
1, when he resigned, saying he had enjoyed being a member but
``unfortunately, the club's present membership practices are
wrongly based on a policy of exclusion.''
   He said the club ``has certainly recently demonstrated that
race, ethnicity, religion and other arbitrary factors do not play a
role in club membership.''
   ``Nonetheless,'' he added, ``I, as a member of the club, have
been disappointed that the club has not taken longer strides toward
making full membership status available to women.''

   The State Department issued an alert Thursday
about travel to China, advising Americans going there to use ``good
sense'' and avoid the massive demonstrations.
   ``The Department of State advises Americans traveling to China
to use caution and avoid areas where demonstrations are
occurring,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   He said there was no indication of any anti-foreign feeling
among the demonstrators. ``Nonetheless,'' he added, ``caution, good
sense, and discretion are called for to ensure that Americans are
not caught up in a demonstration.''
   Boucher stressed that the alert does not advise against travel
to China, only that ``caution should be exercised.''
   Meanwhile, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a
resolution urging China to ``take all necessary steps to establish
a just and democratic society, with a free and open political
system that will protect the essential human rights of all people
living within the country.''
   The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said
Secretary of State James A. Baker III should tell Chinese leaders
that ``official violence directed at those who would peacefully
demonstrate for democracy, liberty and justice will seriously
damage relations with the United States.''

<HEAD>Doctors Accepting More Medicare _ But Fewer Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40 percent of the nation's
physicians are limiting their charges for Medicare patients, the
Health Care Financing Administration said Thursday.
   HCFA said 283,475 physicians _ 40.7 percent of the 696,848
doctors who bill Medicare _ signed agreements with the government
in January saying they would not charge Medicare patients more than
the government reimburses.
   The proportion of physicians agreeing to such limits has been
climbing _ up from 37.3 percent last year, 30.6 percent in 1987 and
28.3 percent in 1986 _ as Medicare has added incentives to bring
more doctors on board.
   The incentives for participating physicians include a 5 percent
pay differential, speedier payments and a listing in health-care
directories made available to Medicare beneficiaries.
   ``The current incentives seem to be working,'' said Louis B.
Hays, acting administrator of HCFA. ``We're up to just over 80
percent of all physician spending under Medicare being done by
assigned claims'' at the Medicare-approved rate.
   At the same time, however, the American Medical Association says
more physicians are beginning to restrict their Medicare practices
because government reimbursement rates in the program are too low.
   An AMA report released this week estimates that between 1984 and
1987, about 13 percent of physicians reduced Medicare patient
access because of the amount the government pays for the services
and limits on what they can charge Medicare patients beyond the
reimbursed charges.
   ``The changes Medicare has made in the last few years are
resulting in doctors reducing the amount of care to which Medicare
patients have access,'' said Dr. Lonnie Bristow, an AMA trustee
from San Pablo, Calif.
   Medicare patients can go to any doctor they want, but when they
see a ``participating physician'' the patients know they will not
have to pay the difference between Medicare's approved amount and
the doctor's usual charge.
   Hays attributed much of the increase to the ``law of ecnomics.''
   ``As beneficiaries discover the advantages to them of utilizing
a particular physician, it's logical that more would become
participating physicians in order to stay competitive,'' he said.
   Physicians who do not sign participation agreements can still
treat Medicare patients and decide on a claim-by-claim basis
whether to accept the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full.
   The participation rate varies widely from state to state.
Alabama has the highest rate, with 76 percent of its physicians
agreeing to charge the Medicare-approved rate for all their
Medicare patients. But in Idaho, only 16 percent have agreed to
participate fully in the program.
   Overall, physician participation rates increased in 44 states
this year, and by 20 percent or more in seven states, HCFA said.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Filed Over Female Jazz Musician Who Lived as a Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose baby son was adopted in 1963
by Billy Tipton has sued the late jazz musician's estate because
Tipton turned out to be a woman posing as a man.
   Patricia Clark, in the suit filed Wednesday in Superior Court,
alleged Tipton defrauded her by promising to be a good father to
the boy, Jon Clark.
   Tipton's death in January from a bleeding ulcer revealed that
the leader of a jazz trio was a woman.
   Tipton, believed to be 75 years old at death, had apparently
assumed a man's identity early in life in hope of succeeding in the
male-dominated field of jazz.
   Ms. Clark said she felt angry and betrayed when she learned
Tipton's secret. She said her fragile relationship with her son,
who has known she was his mother since 1986, has been shattered.
She is seeking unspecified damages.
   Jon Clark, however, said that he's never been close to Ms. Clark
and that she might be another of many people trying to profit from
Tipton's story.
   ``I owe my dad and I don't owe anyone else,'' Jon Clark said.
``I really want people to know what kind of person he was. It's too
bad we all have to fight and argue after someone like him dies.''
   Kitty Oakes, who lived as Tipton's wife after 1960 until they
separated about 10 years ago, said there is no basis for the
lawsuit.
   ``Nobody committed fraud,'' said Ms. Oakes, executor of the
estate. ``I never met her before the adoption and nobody lied to
her. She's just out to make a buck.''
   L. Neil Axtell, Ms. Clark's attorney, said the estate is worth
about $150,000 but could increase because of movie, TV and tabloid
offers the family has received since Tipton's death.
   Tipton, a pianist and saxophone player, traveled throughout the
West with the Billy Tipton Trio in the 1950s before settling in
Spokane and becoming a musicians' agent.

<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it has tipped all
airlines using British airports to be on the lookout for containers
of a Middle Eastern candy that could conceal bombs.
   The Transport Department said it issued an air security alert
after a package of candy was found to contain Semtex, a plastic
explosive.
   It did not identify the candy and gave no further details of the
find. British newspapers published a Transport Department security
memo identifying the candy as ``halawa'' and saying it is similar
in color and texture to Semtex.
   The Czechoslovak-made explosive is odorless, hard to detect and
can be molded into any shape.
   Arabic radio pronounced the name of the candy ``halwa.'' It is
manufactured by companies throughout the Middle East and is
packaged in tins and plastic tubes.
   Newspapers quoted unidentified security officials as saying they
feared Semtex in a candy package could be taken on board, perhaps
by a child, and left with a delayed timer for a later flight.
   Three months ago, the government recommended airline checks on
transistor radios, portable computers, cassette recorders and other
electrical and electronic equipment after investigators announced
that Pan Am Flight 103 had been destroyed by plastic explosive
built into a radio-cassette player.
   The New York-bound jumbo jet blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland,
on Dec. 21, killing 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground.
   At London's Heathrow Airport, police with submachine guns
patrolled terminals and lounges Thursday. Private security staff
employed by U.S. airlines asked passengers detailed questions about
their baggage.
   ``We have been ordered to be on our toes all the time,'' said
one security officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``All staff have to be more vigilant than ever and must not let
their concentration slip for a moment,'' he said. ``We just don't
know where the next threat is coming from and therefore have to
check anything out of the ordinary.''
   The security memo, published in full by the Daily Express, said
the explosive could be molded to the shape of the circular candy
containers, which are eight inches in diameter, six inches deep and
``and large enough to contain all the components of an IED
(improvised explosive device).''
   ``Arming is achieved by pulling a pin accessible through a small
hole in the casing,'' the newspaper quoted the memo as saying.
``Such an item should feel heavier than expected.''
   ``Airlines should be alert to the possibility of such a device
being left on board aircraft at transit stops,'' it quoted the memo
as saying.
   The Transport Department is testing a computer which its
developer, Science Applications International Corp. of California,
claims can detect any explosive. Semtex is transparent to
conventional X-ray detection.
   The device is undergoing trials at Harwell Nuclear Research
Center in western England and will be introduced in British
airports if the trials show the machine is safe and effective, said
a ministry spokesman.

   An all-white jury convicted a former Ku Klux
Klansman of murder Thursday for supplying the rope and pistol used
to abduct and kill a black teen-ager who was strangled and his body
strung up in a tree.
   The conviction of Benjamin Franklin Cox, 27, was the third
successful prosecution in six years in the 1981 slaying of
19-year-old Michael Donald.
   A federal jury in 1987 ordered the United Klans of America, then
the nation's biggest Klan organization, to pay $7 million to
Donald's mother.
   Cox whispered, ``I love you'' to his weeping wife, Gail, before
he was led away in handcuffs. ``There just must be some mistake,''
said Mrs. Cox.
   A lone black woman in the hallway shouted, ``Hooray for
justice!''
   Cox, a truck driver, could receive 10 years to life in prison.
Circuit Judge Michael Zoghby revoked Cox's $28,000 bail and set
sentencing for June 23.
   The jury deliberated about four hours over two days.
   Donald, a part-time technical college student, was abducted at
gunpoint and at random from a dark city street. He was beaten,
strangled, his throat cut and his body left in a tree, where it was
found the next morning.
   Prosecutors said Donald was killed by Klansmen angry about a
mistrial of a black man charged with killing a white police officer.
   Donald's sister, Cynthia Mitchell, said the conviction ``won't
bring my brother back.''
   Still awaiting trial on a murder charge is Bennie Jack Hays, 72,
a former Klan leader and Cox's father-in-law.
   Cox's brother-in-law, Henry Francis Hays, was convicted of
murder in 1983 and sentenced to death.
   Another ex-Klansman, James ``Tiger'' Knowles, who admitted
helping Henry Hays kill Donald, Knowles pleaded guilty in 1983 to
violating Donald's civil rights. He received a life sentence and
agreed to testify against KKK members.
   The slaying also resulted in a $7 million verdict in favor of
the teen-ager's mother, Beulah Mae Donald. She was given ownership
of the Klan headquarters building in Tuscaloosa, which she sold
before she died last year.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee chairman
pledged on Thursday that there would be quick action on rural
development measures that could provide $100 million a year in
loans to stimulate businesses.
   ``This legislation will in many ways determine whether we have a
rural America worth saving as we move into the next century,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   In addition to providing federal seed money for local revolving
loan funds, the proposed Rural Partnerships Act of 1989 would
earmark $200 million this year to improve education, health
services, communications and utilities in rural areas to encourage
business development.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised to
move the legislation to the Senate floor in late June to ensure its
passage this year, Leahy said at a news conference where he was
joined by six of the bill's 23 co-sponsors.
   ``There have been some hard times in the heartland. This bill
sends forth a message of hope,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.,
architect of the legislation's lending program.
   The $100 million in seed money would be aimed at encouraging
banks to increase investments in new or expanding businesses in
rural areas.
   The federal funds would be matched by money from the private
sector and put into revolving funds for loans, loan guarantees and
investments in businesses with fewer than 100 employees.
   The revolving funds would be operated by states, local
governments or economic development groups, assuring local control
of the lending program, sponsors said.
   Other provisions would provide money to:
   _Upgrade telephone lines so rural businesses would have access
to such services as digital switching and fiber optics necessary
for some computer operations.
   _Improve health care and education with telecommunications links
to rural hospitals and schools.
   _Assist communities to comply with federal water standards.
   The $300 million package is a ``modest step forward'' that
recognizes federal budget constraints, Leahy said. He had said he
wanted to put $500 million into the program.
   ``We're dealing with the realities of the budget and $300
million ... is a lot better than nothing, and that's the
alternative,'' he said.

   Which of these summer releases will reach
that ultimate prize of the film business, the $100 million gross:
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The
Karate Kid III'' or ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier''?
   All of them have a fighting chance, since all are sequels to
films that earned more than $100 million in the United States and
Canada. The film industry figures ``Indiana Jones'' and
``Ghostbusters II'' show the most promise for leading the pack,
along with a new version of ``Batman'' starring Michael Keaton and
Jack Nicholson.
   There are other deja vu offerings in this sequel summer:
   Timothy Dalton makes his second coming as James Bond in
``License to Kill.'' Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return to their
Los Angeles Police Department posts in ``Lethal Weapon II.''
Richard Chamberlain, Oliver Reed and Michael York play their old
roles in ``The Return of the Musketeers.'' There's also ``Friday
the 13th VIII'' and ``Nightmare on Elm Street V.''
   What makes a $100 million grosser?
   ``Number one, you need a broad opening in the summertime,'' said
Richard Lederer, who does marketing Warner Bros. and Orion
Pictures. ``You need anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 theaters
(Paramount has 2,000 for `Indiana Jones').
   ``It's important to open with a bang and continue to run for
weeks; you can't have a drop-off in the second or third week. If a
picture opens to medium business and starts to surprise, it's
important to add theaters right away. Summer is the important time,
and it's imperative to get as many theaters as possible.
   ``Most of the big winners are lighter fare, since that's what is
released during the summer. Strong dramas are usually held for
December.''
   A survey of the $100 million movies of the past five years bears
out Lederer's theories. The only drama on the list is the Academy
Award-winning ``Rain Man,'' which has earned $160 million since its
release last December.
   Here is how the other $100 million movies of the past five years
break down (figures in millions from Exhibitor Relations Co.):
   Comedies and comedy-adventures: ``Ghostbusters'' (1984, $221);
``Beverly Hills Cop'' (1984, $230); ``Back to the Future'' (1985,
$220); ``Crocodile Dundee'' (1986, $175); ``Good Morning, Vietnam''
(1987, $125); ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' (1987, $154); ``Three Men
and a Baby'' (1987, $168); ``Twins'' (1988, $103); ``Crocodile
Dundee II'' (1988, $109); ``Big'' (1988, $113); ``Coming to
America'' (1988, $128); ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' (1988, $153).
   Action-adventures and Fantasies: ``Gremlins'' (1984, $148);
``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (1984, $175); ``Rambo II''
(1985, $150); ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986, $109);
``Platoon'' (1985, $137); ``Top Gun'' (1986, $177).
   Thriller: ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987, $157).
   As usual, comedies will be prevalent during the 1989 summer.
   ``Eric the Viking,'' is a spoof from Monty Python's Terry Jones
with Tim Robbins, John Cleese and Mickey Rooney.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' is another outrageous comedy from Spike
Lee (``School Daze''), starring Danny Aiello.
   ``Uncle Buck,'' stars John Candy and Amy Madigan in a John
Hughes film.
   ``Parenthood,'' features Steve Martin, Tom Hulce and Rick
Moranis, and is directed by Ron Howard (''Cocoon.'')
   ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' is a murder caper with Andrew McCarthy
and Jonathan Silverman.
   ``Turner &amp; Hooch,'' stars Oscar nominee Tom Hanks as a
by-the-book cop, and like the current ``K-9,'' his partner is a dog.
   ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' is a courtship comedy from Rob
Reiner (``Stand by Me''), with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.
   The action-adventure junkies will find satisfaction in the
summer fare, aside from Indiana Jones, James Bond, Ghostbusters and
Musketeers, there are the following:
   James Cameron (``Aliens'') is delving into ``The Abyss,'' with
Ed Harris plunging 25,000 feet below the Atlantic Ocean. Kris
Kristofferson and Cheryl Ladd go time-traveling in ``Millenium.''
Clint Eastwood returns as a fugitive on the trail of bail-jumper
Bernadette Peters in ``Pink Cadillac.''
   The Vietnam War is once again explored in ``Casualties of War''
with Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox. Kiefer Sutherland and Lou
Diamond Phillips are a mismatched pair seeking revenge against a
savage murderer in ``Renegades.'' Patrick Swayze plays a legendary
troubleshooter in ``Road House.''
   Dramatic fare won't be entirely overlooked during the
hot-weather months. Robin Williams goes straight as a charismatic
schoolteacher in Australia in ``Dead Poets Society.'' Tom Selleck
seeks vindication after being wrongly sentenced to prison in ``Hard
Rain,'' not to be confused with ``Black Rain,'' with Michael
Douglas as a New York detective delving into the Osaka underworld.
   For Jerry Lee Lewis fans, Dennis Quaid will portray the keyboard
thumper in ``Great Balls of Fire,'' the only film resembling a
musical this summer.
   And there's not much for the wee ones, except for a rerelease of
Disney's classic ``Peter Pan.''

   The Peronist Party, which swept
recent presidential elections, will work with the outgoing
government to bring the faltering economy under control,
President-elect Carlos Menem said Thursday.
   ``We are not assuming any compromises,'' Menem said after
meeting with President Raul Alfonsin for the first time since his
Sunday victory. ``We are simply trying, together with the national
government, to alleviate this situation.''
   The battered economy was the principal issue in the presidential
campaign and the chief issue that defeated government candidate,
Eduardo Angeloz.
   In a first joint step, economists representing both governments
will travel to the United States for negotiations on Argentina's
$59 billion foreign debt with creditor banks, Menem said.
   No details were disclosed, but they were expected to discuss
arrearages, estimated at about $3.5 billion, and new loans, which
have been blocked for nearly a year.
   The meeting between Menem, of the Peronist Party, and Alfonsin,
of the Radical Civic Union, was part of an attempt by both parties
to stabilize Argentina's troubled economy until Menem's six-year
term begins on Dec. 10.
   Peronist Party economic proposals call for a ``social pact''
among workers, businessmen and the government, and a vague
``productive revolution'' to generate employment, double
agricultural harvests and exploit natural resources.
   All will require significant sacrifice from Argentines and Menem
can't risk losing public support by being seen to support failed
Radical Civic Union policies.
   But the economic problems are so pressing, the Peronists can't
sit on the sidelines, either. The national budget deficit is vast,
inflation might top 50 percent this month, and the currency, the
austral, continues its spectacular devaluation.
   The government has not paid interest on its foreign debt since
late last year and principal payments were deferred several years
ago. This year, interest bills amount to $6 billion, about twice
the expected trade surplus and foreign exchange reserves in the
Central Bank are very low, Menem said.
   ``We're not betting on this government's failure,'' Peronist
national deputy and potential economy minister Edward Bauza said
Wednesday after the party endorsed utility price increases needed
to shore up the budget.
   In addition, Menem hopes to quell uncertainty about his
worker-oriented policies. Rumors about them helped to spur the
dramatic devaluation of the currency in the last months.
   ``Our government is not going to embargo deposits, nor
confiscate foreign exchange, nor open security boxes, or anything
like that,'' said Eduardo Menem, a national senator, brother and
key advisor to the president-elect.
   Economic problems are generating political pressures.
   The 4 million-member General Labor Confederation, which backed
Menem in the election, is demanding that the monthly minimum wage
be raised by 125 percent, to the equivalent of about $64 by June 1.
   Some commuter trains were disrupted Wednesday by wildcat
strikes, and bus owners in the capital threaten to strike next week
if they are not allowed to raise fares.

   The military announced a new crackdown Thursday
restricting Palestinian access to Israel and providing an economic
weapon officials hope will help persuade Arabs to abandon their
violent revolt.
   The army will issue special permits allowing some of the 700,000
Gaza Strip residents into Israel, and may expand the measure to 1
million Palestinians on the occupied West Bank, military officials
said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated leaders of the uprising
will be denied permits.
   Leftist lawmakers warned the restrictions could stir new
violence, and some employers feared they could have a negative
impact on Israel's economy.
   In the occupied territories, troops killed two young Arabs.
   They shot and fatally wounded 20-year-old Imran Najib Amer and
Abdel Razik Abu Khollah, 22, Arab hospital officials said. The army
said Amer was among masked Palestinians who blocked a West Bank
road and that he was shot as he tried to grab a soldier's rifle.
They said they were checking the report on Khollah, who officials
said died in a clash with troops in Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp.
   Their deaths bring the toll to 484 Palestinians killed in the
17-month revolt. Twenty-one Israelis also have been killed.
   In other confrontations Thursday, troops shot and wounded at
least 26 Palestinians, Arabs and hospital officials said. The army
confirmed three wounded.
   Most of the occupied lands were paralyzed by a general strike
called by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, to
protest alleged Israeli interference with mosques.
   Army commanders say they avoid entering mosques, but they close
off access to some when they anticipate hostile crowds.
   The army Thursday partially lifted a general curfew that had
restricted Gaza Strip residents to their homes since Monday.
   But officers reimposed the curfew Thursday night ``for no
special reason,'' according to an army spokesman. It would last
``until further notice,'' he said.
   Military officers say the Gaza closure and permit requirements
are to punish Palestinians for anti-Israeli activities.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, an architect of the plan, said on
Israel television Thursday that the Palestinians ``must choose
between the intefadeh (uprising) and the path of peace.''
   He told leaders of his right-wing Likud bloc Wednesday that
Cabinet approval of a peace initiative means Israel now can take
tougher measures against violence.
   ``When you have a peace initiative in one hand, the other is
freer to strike at the rioters,'' Shamir said.
   In an interview Thursday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
the aim is ``to deliver a message to the Palestinians that
stone-throwing, petrol-bombing and other means of violence do not
change a bit the Israeli political position.''
   Military officials said they will use the new permits to bar
Gaza Strip residents convicted of serious crimes. Some 28,000
Palestinians have been convicted of crimes in Israel in the past 10
years, officials said.
   Rabin indicated ringleaders in the revolt also would not get
permits.
   He said the army could start issuing permits by the end of May
and expected the process to be completed within three months.
   They might expande restrictions to the West Bank ``to make the
Palestinians in Gaza and later on the West Bank realize that the
right to leave the territories is a privilege,'' he said.
   ``There are too many sectors of Israel's economy which have
become, in my humble opinion, too dependent on the workers who come
from the territories,'' Rabin said.
   Restrictions will most affect 50,000 Gazan and 60,000 West Bank
residents working in Israel in construction, farming, municipal
services, hotels and factories.
   In 1987, Palestinians working in Israel earned $700 million,
about one third of the gross national produce of the occupied
territories, Rabin said.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of Rabin's center-left Labor
Party, said Israel could not keep all work from Palestinians
because it would create ``more bitterness and resistance.''
   Israeli industrialists fear the new measures will leave them
short of labor. Some have appealed for permits to bring low-wage
workers from abroad, including Lebanon and Portugal.
   ``The construction industry is in a catastrophic situation,''
Aharon Sapir, director-general of the Contractors Association, said
on Israel radio. Members of his association employ 40,000
Palestinians, about half their work force.
   Left-wing legislators condemned the new crackdown, which Yossi
Sarid of the Citizens Rights Movement described as ``stupid,
unjust, ineffective and immoral.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the
Soviet Union completed a visit to China on Thursday that opened a
new era of good will after three decades of estrangement between
the two great communist powers.
   Gorbachev flew home from Shanghai, a city of 12 million people
where he visited the Minhang Special Economic Zone, an area set
aside for foreign investment.
   He toured the Shanghai Mitsubishi Elevator Co. factory, a joint
venture of Chinese and Japanese manufacturing firms in the zone.
   As part of his own economic reforms, Gorbachev seeks to
encourage Soviet enterprises to modernize by taking foreign
partners in joint ventures similar to those China has launched with
considerable success.
   A joint communique issued when he left said Gorbachev's meetings
with Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders ``symbolized the
normalization of relations between the two countries.''
   China and the Soviet Union split 30 years over who should lead
the communist world and remained at odds because of border
disputes, conflicting strategic interests, Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan and the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.
   Gorbachev's four-day visit, which both sides described as
historic, occurred in the shadow of a huge pro-democracy upheaval
in which up to 1 million protesters took over the streets of
central Beijing.
   To keep him away from the demonstrators, scheduled events were
moved to other locations or canceled.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, issued a report after
Gorbachev's departure saying Chinese police had ``lost control'' of
the crowds occupying central Tiananmen Square and main streets
leading into it.
   The official Chinese agency Xinhua said Gorbachev, in
conversation with Vice Premier Wu Xueqian before leaving, ``wished
the current situation in China to be eased and settled.''
   In several speeches, the Kremlin leader said social unrest
experienced by the Soviet Union and other communist nations was a
natural consequence of more liberal policies. He said
democratization was crucial to the success of economic reform.
   In the joint communique, the two nations announced restoration
of contacts between their Communist parties and elevated talks on
longstanding border disputes to the foreign minister level.
   They pledged ``to take measurse to cut down the military forces
in the areas along the Sino-Soviet boundary to a minimum level
commensurate with the normal, good-neighborly relations between the
two countries.''
   While in Beijing, Gorbachev proposed complete demilitarization
of the 4,300-mile frontier, now guarded by about 600,000 Soviet and
1 million Chinese soldiers.
   The largest section of the communique concerned Cambodia, the
last and most serious obstacle China posed to normal relations with
Moscow. China agreed to the summit only after the Kremlin began
pushing its ally Vietnam toward ending its 10-year occupation of
Cambodia.
   Soviet officials said talks on the communique bogged down over
language regarding Cambodia, where China supports rebel forces, and
in the end the two sides agreed to differ.
   China repeated its support for a provisional government led by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of the three-party guerrilla
alliance, and including both the resistance and the Hanoi-sponsored
administration of Premier Hun Sen.
   The Soviet Union said only that internal problems, including
preparation for general elections under international supervision,
should be solved by the Cambodians themselves.
   They agreed that civil war should be avoided after the
Vietnamese withdrawal, now scheduled to be finished by Sept. 30,
and outside parties should gradually end military aid to the
factions.
   ``Neither side would seek hegemony of any form'' in Asia or
elsewhere, the joint statement declared. China has long accused the
superpowers, particularly the Soviet Union, of ``hegemony,'' or
trying to dominate weaker nations.
   It also said normalization of relations ``is not directed at any
third country.'' The United States, which in the past benefited
strategically from the rift, has said the rapprochement contributes
to regional and world stability.
   While in Shanghai, where smaller demonstrations have been held,
Gorbachev met with city party chief Jiang Zemin and Mayor Zhu
Rongji and laid a wreath at a monument to the Russian novelist
Pushkin.

<HEAD>U.S. Court Says City of Lawrence Went Too Far Hunting Welfare Frauds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that the city of
Lawrence violated the Constitution by confiscating welfare ID cards
from a drug suspect.
   Lawrence Mayor Kevin Sullivan had ordered four months ago that
police gather evidence of possible welfare fraud whenever anyone is
suspected of any crime. The cards were to be turned over to state
welfare authorities for investigation.
   Sullivan said his depressed former mill town of 61,000 people is
too small and poor to be as easy on welfare cheats as he claims the
state is.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Nelson ruled that the city
violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable
search and seizure when it took welfare IDs belonging to Maria
Ocasio, a 47-year-old mother of 11.
   Police in Lawrence, 30 miles north of Boston, searched Ms.
Ocasio's home March 7 with a warrant to look for drugs and seized
11 bags of cocaine, six bags of marijuana, two marijuana
cigarettes, 18 needles and syringes, and $481 in cash.
   The police also took four welfare identification cards. Ms.
Ocasio receives federal benefits for her children, food stamps and
medical benefits.
   Judge David Nelson ruled that police had no right to take the
cards because they had no cause to suspect Ms. Ocasio of welfare
fraud.
   Ms. Ocasio never was charged with welfare fraud.
   Ms. Ocasio has her cards back and never lost her benefits, her
lawyer said. But along with the father of some of her children,
Wilfredo Santiago, she faces cocaine and marijuana charges. She is
free on her own recognizance.
   Barbara Lybarger, who represented Ms. Ocasio, said about 120
people have been affected, some after such petty crimes as
shoplifting and disorderly conduct.
   Mayor Sullivan said police must be more careful about protecting
people's rights, but he defended his policy in principle.
   ``We felt the Department of Welfare was negligent in
investigating cases where drug dealers were getting access to the
welfare system, while making huge amounts of money,'' Sullivan said
in an interview.
   ``The state tends to be soft on crime, through its human
services department, by encouraging this type of activity, making
it easy to get on (welfare) with little or no checking.''
   He said 13,000 people are on welfare in Lawrence. ``The city is
trying to make an incentive to work, but the commonwealth is making
an incentive not to work,'' Sullivan said.
   A state official said the mayor is wrong but reacting to hard
times.
   ``His city is in need. When times are tough and money gets
tight, we see the syndrome of blame the victim,'' said Michal
Regunberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Welfare.
``It's no picnic to be on welfare.''
   ``There are strict eligibility requirements for all welfare,''
Ms. Regunberg said. ``Someone can't just walk in off the street and
get welfare. And what we're talking about here, by and large, is
children. Two-thirds of people on welfare are children.''
   ``The mayor would have us believe healthy males can walk in and
get relief.''
   Ms. Lybarger said she has been a legal aid lawyer specializing
in government benefits cases since 1972 and never heard of a policy
as sweeping as Sullivan's.
   ``There are probably people making enough money from drugs that
they are not eligible for welfare, and they should be investigated.
This policy has taken much too broad a sweep at this problem,'' Ms.
Lybarger said.

<TEXT>
   Senators from wheat-growing states introduced
relief legislation Thursday for farmers whose winter crops have
been devastated by this year's drought.
   ``Our bill is simple and straightforward,'' said Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan. ``We believe it is time to extend the 1988 relief act to
crops planted in 1988 but harvested in 1989.'' He said it would
cover mostly winter wheat.
   Provisions would be administered along the lines of last year
concerning payment rates, benefits and requirements on federal crop
insurance participation in future years, Dole said.
   The legislation also calls for $25 million to transport
livestock to areas where feed and water exist and $25 million for
livestock producers who have had to spend money on emergency water
projects.
   Money saved under the deficiency payment program would be used
to cover the cost of the legislation.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said about $500 million in federal
deficiency payments was saved because of higher market prices on
wheat. The money would have gone to farmers if wheat prices had
been below the federally set target price.
   Joining Dole and Boren in sponsoring were Sens. Nancy Landon
Kassebaum, R-Kan.; Don Nickles, R-Okla.; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas;
Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Conrad Burns, R-Mont.;
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.; and David Pryor, D-Ark.

<HEAD>FAA Moves To Ground Pilots Cited For Drunken Driving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots with drunken driving records would be
grounded under rules the Federal Aviation Administration proposed
Thursday.
   The rules, which are open to modification before becoming final
later this year, would deny an application or suspend a pilot's
certificate if records show two driver's license revocations or
drunken driving convictions within a three-year period due to
alcohol or drug use.
   FAA studies show that more than 10,000 licensed pilots have
drunken driving records, but officials said they had not determined
how many might be affected by the new rules. Last month, the FAA
announced a crackdown on more than 1,000 pilots who had failed to
report drunken driving arrests, as required on their applications
for required medical certificates.
   The announcement follows concerns raised by the National
Transportation Safety Board over pilots who were allowed to fly
even though their driver's licenses had been suspended for drunken
driving.
   The FAA rule would require a pilot to report any action against
his driver's license related to alcohol or drug use up to three
years before the rule takes effect.
   Failure to report subsequent actions within 60 days after they
occur would be grounds for a pilot losing his license to fly.
   The rule would become final later this year if it passes a
public comment period and further analysis by FAA lawyers, said
agency spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane.
   The FAA said a comparison of pilot medical records with the
National Driver Register showed that the driver's licenses of
10,300 of the more than 700,000 active pilots had been suspended or
revoked in the preceding seven years for drunken driving.
   More than three-fourths of those did not report the convictions
to the FAA when applying for a medical certificate to fly, although
such a report is required, the agency said.
   The new rule also would cause a pilot's medical certificate to
expire 61 days after a single drunken driving conviction and
require reapplication with proof that the pilot was enrolled in an
alcohol-treatment program.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's automated information systems
have been plagued by cost overruns and schedule delays, and the
department has submitted inaccurate estimates to Congress, the
comptroller general said Thursday.
   Charles A. Bowsher told the House Government Operations
subcommittee on legislation and national security that a study of
eight automated systems that will be used to account for billions
of dollars in logistics and personnel resources found significant
cost increases.
   The office of the secretary of defense estimated the cost to
develop and deploy the systems at about $1 billion, but that has
almost doubled, Bowsher said. Further increases in cost are likely,
he said.
   In addition, completion dates for all but one system have been
delayed by three to seven years, and none of the systems are
scheduled to be deployed completely until the early 1990s.
   ``From my perspective, these problems indicate that Defense is
not effectively controlling major system development efforts, and
that the office of the secretary of defense is not rigorously
enforcing established oversight policies,'' Bowsher said.
   Bowsher, who also heads the General Accounting Office, said the
congressional watchdog agency found that cost estimates submitted
to Congress ``were not, in all cases, accurate, current or
complete.''
   Specifically, the Navy submitted an estimate of $91 million for
its Integrated Disbursing and Accounting System. But an internal
Navy estimate of developing, deploying and maintaining the system
was $879 million.
   The GAO also found that the Pentagon developed new systems
rather ``than considering and maximizing the use of existing
systems to avoid duplication and unnecessary expenditures,''
Bowsher said.
   ``I continue to be amazed and appalled by such revelations,''
said Rep. John Conyers, Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee.
   Cynthia Kendall, deputy comptroller of information resources
management in the Defense Department, said the Pentagon discussed
the automated systems with the subcommittee last September, and
since then ``has continued to pursue improved policies and ...
management.''
   Kendall also said the department's comptroller has set up a
quarterly reporting system that includes certification of costs,
schedules and other information.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday disposed of a
Florida case that sparked some unusual judicial acts and widespread
speculation about Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's views on abortion.
   All in all, the case may be far less consequential outside the
Sunshine State than some claimed.
   Nevertheless, the case illustrated vividly how potentially
explosive any abortion-related dispute has become as the nation
awaits a Supreme Court ruling on the fate of Roe vs. Wade, its 1973
decision legalizing abortion.
   The court is being asked in a Missouri case to overturn or
curtail Roe vs. Wade, which said women have a constitutional right
to end their pregnancies. A decision is expected by late June.
   Into this mix was thrown the case of T.W., a 15-year-old Florida
girl who earlier this month sought a state judge's permission to
have an abortion.
   Like some two dozen other states, Florida requires unwed minors
still dependent on their parents to get the consent of their
parents or a judge before obtaining an abortion.
   The Supreme Court has upheld parental-consent and
parental-notification abortion laws if such a ``judicial bypass''
is included. But the Florida law was deemed defective, and
therefore invalid, by a state judge and a state appals court.
   The Florida Supreme Court has agreed to review the law in
September but refused to let officials enforce it until then.
   Before invalidating the law, state Judge Jerry Lockett did a
peculiar thing. He appointed a lawyer to serve as a guardian for
T.W.'s fetus even though no provision in Florida law calls for such
an appointment.
   It was that guardian who Tuesday sought help from Kennedy, who
handles emergency matters from Florida for the high court.
   Kennedy is the court's newest member, and his views on abortion
are not known. His is considered a key swing vote in the Missouri
case.
   Judges usually take no action in a case until certain they have
the authority _ what lawyers call jurisdiction. Kennedy's authority
in T.W.'s case was questionable for two reasons.
   First, the matter was pending before the state Supreme Court.
   Second, the emergency request came from a lawyer for a fetus.
The justices consistently have ruled that a fetus is not a
``person'' under the Constitution and, until late in a pregnancy
when it is capable of surviving outside the womb, has no legal
rights.
   Kennedy issued a stay _ in effect reinstating the Florida law
and blocking T.W.'s abortion until the stay was lifted by the full
Supreme Court two days later.
   Speculation immediately centered on the justice's motive.
   Was he tipping his hand as an abortion foe? Molly Yard,
president of the National Organization for Women, was among those
who thought so.
   She said her group ``has never doubted that Justice Kennedy is
hostile to the constitutional concept of the right to abortion, and
his action today bears out that evaluation.''
   Others, however, note that Kennedy referred T.W.'s case to the
full court, even as he issued the stay, and then apparently did not
dissent when the court set aside his action.
   Perhaps Kennedy was proceeding with caution in light of the
Missouri case being deliberated and two other parental-consent
cases still pending before the court. We likely will never know.

   Jurors who cleared a liquor company of negligence
for failing to warn a pregnant woman about the dangers of drinking
say they felt little sympathy for her.
   Members of the federal jury Wednesday said Candance Thorp should
have known drinking while pregnant could harm her unborn child.
   Mrs. Thorp and her husband, Harold, sought about $4 million from
Jim Beam Brands Co. for lifetime care for their 4-year-old son,
Michael, born with deformities, retardation and other problems
categorized as symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome.
   ``I was surprised they were actually suing Jim Beam,'' said
juror Staci Gilbreth. ``I know that (Jim Beam whiskey) was what she
drank the most, but my gosh. We wondered if it was just that Jim
Beam had the most money.''
   ``They could have sued everyone,'' said Geraldine Jackson,
another juror, referring to testimony Mrs. Thorp was seen drinking
beer in bars several times during her pregnancy.
   Mrs. Thorp, 39, testified she was an alcoholic who drank as much
as half a fifth of Jim Beam a day during her pregnancy, but said
she would have stopped drinking if warning labels meant for
pregnant women were on the bottles.
   ``We're obviously disappointed with the verdict, but the jury
system operates,'' said the Thorps' lawyer, Barry Epstein.
   No decision was made on an appeal, he said.
   During the trial, Epstein said the alcohol company had an
obligation to warn the public of the risks of drinking while
pregnant.
   Witnesses said Mrs. Thorp was warned repeatedly by relatives and
friends about the dangers and that she and other alcoholics would
not have heeded a warning on a label.
   Jurors said they decided the danger of to unborn babies was
common knowledge and said that was a factor in their decision to
deny damages.
   Attorneys said the case was the first against a liquor company
for birth defects linked to alcohol. Two similar cases are pending
in Washington state courts.
   About 1 percent of the infants born in the United States each
year, or 35,000 babies, are born with fetal alcohol syndrome.
Symptoms include slow growth, central nervous system impairment,
hyperactivity, retardation and facial deformities.
   A federal law goes into effect in November requiring that all
bottles of liquor, wine and beer to carry a label warning that
drinking while pregnant may be hazardous to fetuses.

   Investigators who linked him to a corruption probe
are lying, a former member of the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo said in a statement released Thursday.
   The statement by Mikhail S. Solomentsev, who was retired from
the Politburo in September, was read at a regular briefing by
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev.
   ``I believe it is my party and civic duty to state that the
assertions by the investigators of the U.S.S.R. Procurator
General's Office are a brazen provocation, a vile and downright
base lie,'' the statement said.
   ``Never and under no circumstances had I given a pretext for
such accusations.''
   Before his retirement, Solomentsev was in charge of the Party
Control Commission, which disciplines party members who violate
rules.
   His statement followed by two days a denial by Politburo member
Yegor K. Ligachev, who has been considered a conservative
counterweight to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a potential
rival.
   Perfiliev also read Ligachev's statement, which previously had
been distributed by Novosti news agency.
   Solomentsev and Ligachev were reacting to statements made by
criminal investigators Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, who are
famous throughout the Soviet Union for their probe into corruption
in Uzbekistan.
   Both Ligachev and Solomentsev said they demanded an
investigation of the charges, and that the results be published.
   Gdlyan was elected to the new Congress of People's Deputies
parliament in March with about 87 percent of the vote in a Moscow
region.
   On Sunday, two days after mentioning Ligachev and Solomentsev in
connection with the continuing investigation, Ivanov won 61 percent
of the vote in a race among more than two dozen candidates in
Leningrad.

<HEAD>Dickinson Seeks Early Showdown on MX-Midgetman Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ranking Republican on the House Armed
Services Committee called Thursday for an early congressional
showdown over President Bush's plan to proceed with development of
two kinds of land-based nuclear missiles.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., asked Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
to seek congressional approval if he intends to use money
designated for deployment of the rail-mobile MX missile to keep the
Midgetman missile program alive for the remainder of fiscal 1989.
   Dickinson said in a statement that such a request would give
Midgetman opponents ``a mechanism to kill it in the weeks ahead
unless a longer-term deal to ratify the president's package is
struck.''
   In last year's defense budget bill, Congress provided $250
million for the Midgetman and $600 million for the raid-based MX
program, but directed that no more than $250 million of the MX
money could be spent before Feb. 15.
   The remaining $350 million was supposed to have been reallocated
after the new president decided whether to pursue one program, the
other, or both.
   Cheney initially recommended that the Midgetman be scrapped. But
Bush, bowing to pressure from congressional Democrats who support
the small, single-warhead missile, opted to proceed with both
programs, but to deploy the 50 MX missiles in rail cars first.
   In his new Pentagon budget request for fiscal 1990, Bush calls
for $1.2 million for deployment of the MX and $100 million to
continue research and development of the Midgetman.
   Dickinson, who backed Cheney's recommendation for cancellation
of the Midgetman, said he supports Bush's compromise package but
does not want to see the missile debate drag on for months while
Democrats maneuver to increase funding for the Midgetman.
   ``My tolerance for any attempt to plus-up the Midgetman and thus
undermine the president's politically and fiscally acceptable
compromise is zero,'' Dickinson said. ``If these attempts continue,
I will work as hard as I can to kill the program outright.''
   Some Democrats who have supported the Midgetman indicated after
Bush announced his compromise decision last month that they might
join Republican opponents in efforts to kill the missile rather
than support funding two programs in a period of intense fiscal
constaints.
   Cheney has told Congress it will cost about $350 million to keep
the Midgetman program alive for the remainder of fiscal 1989, $100
million more than was authorized last year. Dickinson said any
reallocation of MX money to make up the difference must be approved
by Congress.

   David S. Ruder announced his resignation
Thursday as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
after guiding the agency through two tumultuous years that included
the 1987 stock market crash and a historic investigation of
corruption on Wall Street.
   Ruder, in a letter to President Bush, said he planned to return
to the faculty of Northwestern University School of Law at the end
of August. He left there in August 1987 to head the SEC, which
regulates the nation's financial markets and oversees disclosure
requirements for U.S. publicly traded corporations.
   The date of his resignation depends on when his successor is
appointed. He gave no reason for leaving, but Bush had been widely
expected to name someone else to the post even though senior
Democrats in Congress were urging that Ruder stay on. His term
expires in June 1991.
   On the list of possible successors are attorney Thomas A. Russo,
a former division director at the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Edward H. Fleischman, who already holds a seat on the
five-member SEC, and Kraft Inc. Chairman John M. Richman of Chicago.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper said the administration was
reviewing the appointment and declined further comment.
   In his letter to Bush, dated Thursday, Ruder said it was crucial
that the commission have ``vigorous and strong leadership.''
   When Ruder, 60, took over the SEC, he had a reputation as a
respected legal expert and, as former dean of the Northwestern Law
School, as a skilled administrator.
   That skill was tested a little more than two months later on
Oct. 19, 1987, when the stock market crashed, registering a record
508-point decline on the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks.
   Ruder, who had little experience operating in the national media
spotlight, was sharply criticized by congressional committee
chairmen for talking with reporters on the day of the crash about
possibility of a trading halt. Some analysts said his remarks
squashed a recovery attempt by the market and deepened the plunge
while Ruder maintained he was misquoted.
   However, in the debate over market reform that followed, Ruder
soon won friends among Democrats on Capitol Hill for hewing a
somewhat independent line from the free-market Reagan
administration.
   The White House and Treasury Departments resisted any attempt to
combine the regulation of stock and futures markets, which are
regulated with a lighter hand by the CFTC. Ruder, alone among top
administration officials, argued that stock and futures markets are
closely linked and that his agency should coordinate regulation of
both.
   Also, in the wake of an outcry from small investors who lost
money in the crash, he pushed the securities industry to improve
its system of arbitrating disputes with customers and to take other
steps to restore public confidence.
   In the end, the Reagan administration view prevailed on market
reform proposals, but Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, praised Ruder for
``understanding the importance of maintaining public confidence.''
   ``He was a fine chairman and I hope someone of his integrity,
ability and orientation will succeed him,'' said Dingell, who had
urged Bush to reappoint Ruder.
   ``I thought he brought an unusually scholarly and calm
perspective to one of the more turbulent times in the market's
history. He probably will be respected more for what he didn't do,
rather than for what he did do. Namely, he didn't overreact,'' said
Roberick M. Hills, chairman of the SEC under the administation of
President Ford.
   William Proxmire, former chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, had opposed Ruder's nomination but now says that was a
mistake.
   ``Frankly, I think he worked out well,'' Proxmire said. ``Ruder
believes strongly in regulation. He believes that securities
issuers should be vigorously required to provide information to
investors and if they don't they should be penalized, fined or
jailed.'' less regulation rather than more.''
   Ruder, had he stayed, faced presiding over a commission that
likely would have been increasingly out of sync with his views.
Ronald Reagan, a month before leaving the presidency, replaced
Aulana Peters, a Ruder ally, with Mary Schapiro, a former futures
industry lobbyist. The term of Charles C. Cox, another frequent
Ruder ally, has expired and his nomination by Reagan was never
acted on.
   Ruder also broke from the administration in seeking large
increases in his agency's budget, which had remained static while
stock and bond trading mushroomed.
   Gary G. Lynch, the 38-year-old attorney who heads the SEC's
enforcement division, announced his own resignation, effective
mid-July, last week.

   President Bush told three leading South
African foes of apartheid Thursday that he would press ``in every
way possible'' to end that nation's system of racial separation,
his spokesman said, but gave no indication of any change in U.S.
policy.
   Nonetheless, the three men with whom Bush met _ Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, the Rev. Allan Boesak and the Rev. Beyers Naude _
said they were impressed that Bush showed an open attitude to their
concerns.
   Tutu, who heads the Anglican Church in South Africa, was
complimentary of Bush's attitude and expressed hopes for progress
with his administration.
   ``I think there is a very warm openness and we think the door
stands ajar. No door has been slammed in our face,'' Tutu said
after the 20-minute meeting, also attended by presidential Chief of
Staff John Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday
that Bush continues to view additional sanctions against the
minority white government of South Africa as ``counterproductive.''
   Tutu and his colleagues contrasted Bush's attitude to that of
his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   Once Reagan opposed economic sanctions against South Africa,
Boesak said, anti-apartheid activists felt ``there was no further
possibility of even discussing the issue.''
   Reagan vetoed the sanctions but Congress overrode him. They
banned new U.S. investment in South Africa; barred imports of South
African coal, steel, uranium and textiles, and prohibited South
African airliners from landing in the United States.
   Tutu said after meeting with Bush that he had urged the
president to ``take the moral leadership'' toward ending apartheid.
   ``We do not want to be overly optimistic,'' Tutu told reporters.
But he said he was impressed that Bush wanted to be ``a catalyst
for change'' and ``a positive influence.''
   Boesak added, ``The very fact that he values the opinion of
those of us who represent black people in South Africa, that in
itself is a sign that we did not get in the same measure from the
previous administration.''
   Tutu said there were no specific indications of a change away
from Reagan administration policies. ``But the way we were
received, the fact that we were received'' was a hopeful sign.
   The archbishop said the three asked Bush to urge the Pretoria
government to negotiate with representatives of the South African
black majority.
   Boesak spoke to Bush about the need to give hope to young South
Africans, ``and that touched a responsive cord,'' Tutu said.
   ``We said we wanted the United States ... to take the moral
leadership of the world in helping to end apartheid and bringing
the South African government to the negotiating table,'' the
archbishop said.
   To that end, Bush and Congress should support new economic and
diplomatic sanctions intended to pressure financially strapped
South Africa, the group told a news conference.
   Boesak said the most effective sanctions would target the South
African coal, oil and gold-mining industries.
   The three clergymen said they did not specifically discuss
sanctions with Bush, but do hope to have further talks with his
administration.
   Speaking for the administration, Fitzwater said that officials
``will be looking at ways to best use American pressure, influence
and leverage to bring about justice and equality to South Africa.''
   Fitzwater said that the president ``shares the archbishop's
abhorrence of apartheid'' and had ``promised to stress his
opposition'' to apartheid ``in every way possible.''
   Meeting with reporters a day earlier, Fitzwater said Bush sees
further sanctions as ``counterproductive.''
   Fitzwater said after Thursday's meeting that Bush had issued an
invitation to Albertina Sisulu, one of the leaders of the United
Democatic Front in South Africa, to visit the United States.
   She is ``restricted'' in her homeland, meaning she cannot speak
at public rallies or be quoted in news accounts. State Department
officials denied the invitation was an attempt to provoke Pretoria
to give her a passport.
   The Thursday meeting came as U.S. officials prepared for the
visit of F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to succeed P.W. Botha as
president of South Africa after Botha resigns in September. De
Klerk would be the first top South African leader to officially
visit here in 30 years.
   Anti-apartheid leaders are looking to De Klerk's ascendancy,
along with the new administration in Washington, as a window of
opportunity for change. De Klerk has called for political reforms,
but opposes complete enfranchisement for blacks, who comprise 85
percent of the nation's population.

   The Bush administration is prepared to urge an
escalation of pressure on Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
if he ignores an Organization of American States call for a
transfer of power, U.S. officials said Thursday.
   After OAS foreign ministers approved a resolution on Panama
Wednesday, senior U.S. officials met with Latin American diplomats
Thursday to discuss strategy for dealing with Noriega in the event
he refuses to cooperate with OAS mediators.
   The key provision of the resolution empowers the mediators to
try to promote a ``national accord, within democratic mechanisms
and in the shortest period possible, to ensure the transfer of
power with full respect for the sovereign will of Panamanian
people.''
   The resolution also blames Noriega for ``grave events and
abuses'' in Panama since national elections were held on May 7. The
election returns were tossed out amid allegations of widespread
fraud.
   One of the U.S. officials, commenting on condition he not be
named, said there was a simple reason why the ministers overcame an
initial reluctance to criticize Noriega by name in their resolution.
   ``Nobody there disagreed with the proposition that we ought to
try to get rid of Noriega,'' he said.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter promised his government
will cooperate fully with the mediators, but there was little
expectation here that the negotiation will go smoothly.
   If it becomes apparent that Noriega is intent on clinging to
power, the resolution allows for ``subsequent measures'' to be
taken against him.
   The officials pointed out that, a decade ago, it took three OAS
foreign ministers meetings to win approval of a resolution calling
for the resignation of then-Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza.
   They suggested that if Noriega responds to the Wednesday night
resolution by digging in his heels, the OAS could take the same
action against Noriega that it did against Somoza in 1979.
   The officials said Noriega will have difficulty attempting to
portray his government's problems as U.S.-inspired because the
resolution was a Latin American initiative.
   Panama has said the United States systematically sought to
subvert the election process there and has committed economic
aggression against Panama through sanctions.
   President Bush praised the OAS resolution Thursday and his
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're gratified that the OAS
countries shared the United States' position.''
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said,
``Noriega should listen to the clear message from his people and
from his neighbors. It's time for him to leave.''
   Appointed as OAS mediators were the foreign ministers of
Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad. They will fly to Panama on Monday
for consultations with Panamanian authorities.
   The mediators are assigned to report back to their fellow
hemispheric foreign ministers after June 5.

<HEAD>Kassebaum Seeking Third Term Despite Two-Term Pledge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., who
promised in her first and second campaigns that she would serve
only two terms, announced Thursday she changed her mind and would
seek a third term in 1990.
   Her decision dashed hopes of Democrats that she would retire and
thus give them a much-improved chance of ending a 50-year drought
in which no Democrat has represented Kansas in the Senate.
   When she first ran in 1978, she pledged to serve only 12 years _
two six-year terms _ if she won a Senate seat. She was elected that
year. When seeking re-election in 1984, she repeated that vow and
retained the seat.
   She said she changed her mind and decided she could best serve
Kansas by using her seniority, but added that it troubled her to
break the pledge. ``It did bother me because I believe a number of
Kansans valued the fact that when I say something that's what I
mean,'' Kassebaum said.
   However, she argued that it would hurt Kansas if she limited her
tenure when others in Congress are not subject to similiar
restrictions. There is no limit on the number of terms a person can
serve in the Senate or the House.
   ``If you're the only one ... you simply give up some of the
credentials and the seniority that you have built here that you
hope can be useful to your state,'' Kassebaum said.

   Robert Morris College _ its dormitories,
classrooms, library, gym and the fabled ``kissing rock'' _ sold at
auction Thursday for $400,000.
   The College Education Foundation, a non-profit group of area
businesses, won with the only bid for the 20-acre parcel. If the
college's trustees approve the bid, the group wants to find another
school to take over the facilities.
   Loud applause broke out with the foundation's successful bid as
teary-eyed students stood in the grass outside the auction hall on
campus and peered in the windows.
   The ``kissing rock'' sits just inside the main gate of the
Carthage campus, and folklore has it that any student who sits on
it is fair game for a kiss.
   ``We're glad this day is passed,'' said Richard Pickett,
president of Robert Morris College, a two-year business school that
used to be based in this western Illinois city but now has its main
campus in Chicago.
   ``We're disappointed it didn't bring a more reasonable figure,''
Pickett added. ``But it's time Robert Morris College gets on to
other things. I don't have to worry about Carthage anymore.''
   Terry Newell, a Carthage car dealer and president of the
education foundation, said he was confident the Robert Morris
trustees would approve the bid.
   ``I feel it will be accepted and we'll have no problem raising
$400,000,'' Newell said. ``We're going to try and get somebody to
come in and replace Robert Morris College. We want to keep it
whole, viable and an educational institution if possible.''
   Newell said his group would consider any offer, including
turning the campus into a prison. He said the same process was used
in 1965 when the old Carthage College closed. His group bought the
campus for $1.1 million at that time, then sold it for the same
price to Robert Morris College, he said.
   ``We'll look at any possibility, but our top priority is to keep
it a school,'' Newell said.
   About 50 protesters outside said they were concerned the school
would be auctioned off in smaller pieces if a buyer for the whole
parcel could not be found.
   ``We don't want the school sold in pieces,'' said Beulah Shirey,
a Carthage resident who joined the other protesters, some carrying
signs reading ``Carthage _ Divided We Fall'' and ``Carthage Pride.''
   In December, school officials stunned Carthage residents with
their decision to close the campus because of a deficit of $460,000.
   The school was one of largest employers in this city of 3,000.
The college, which will close this summer, has about 370 students
and 110 faculty and staff members. About 1,350 students attend the
Chicago campus.
   City officials feared not only the loss of the school's $2
million annual payroll, but the other benefits to the local economy
estimated at four times that amount.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's
vow to keep medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe if the U.S.
modernizes its short-range arms is an ``appalling'' threat
unsupported by the negotiating record, a former chief U.S. arms
control negotiator said Thursday.
   ``I believe that Shevardnadze's statement was pretty
appalling,'' Max Kampelman, chief strategic arms control negotiator
in the Reagan administration, told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   ``I cannot believe they want to leave the message that they want
to open up questions about their willingness to live up to their
arms control commitments,'' Kampelman said.
   Shevardnadze, speaking in Bonn, West Germany last Saturday, said
that if the United States did not drop plans to more than triple
the range of its aging Lance Missiles in Western Europe, the Soviet
Union would respond, either by developing a new short-range weapon
or by retaining SS-23 missiles which have a range of 310 miles.
   The 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces or INF treaty bans all
missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,500 miles, including the
SS-23.
   Kampelman noted that some have speculated that there might have
been an implicit understanding at one level or another of the U.S.
and Soviet negotiating teams that if the Soviets agreed to
dismantle the SS-23 the United States would not give modernized
short-range missiles a range close to 300 miles.
   Kampelman said that when he heard of Shevardnadze's statement,
``I was certain that if there had been that kind of understanding,
I would have known.''
   He said he checked with other negotiators who were part of the
hard bargaining that produced the INF treaty.
   Kampelman said they ``agreed with me that there was absolutely
no reason for the Soviets to believe there was anything that could
be so interpreted.''
   He said that possibility did present itself at one time but the
Soviets did not agree to it.
   ``The Soviets were told, `OK, but then we don;'t want you to
complain if our modernization comes close'' to 300 miles.
   Kampelman said the ststement was ``not typical of the
Shevardnadze I have been dealing with for quite some time.''
   ``I have never before seen a threat and I was surprised,''
Kampelman said.
   ``I have to believe this was part of the `old thinking' of the
Soviet Union toward Western Europe, which is to frighten them.''
   Paul Nitze, who was President Reagan's chief arms control
adviser, said he cannot imagine that Shevardnadze would have made
his vow ``without some explanation.''
   ``There must be something, some place, that I haven't been able
to find,'' Nitze said.
   But Kampelman there mere be an outside chance Soviet negotiators
were told informally that ``something is possible.''
   ``That he has evidence (that a commitment was actually made) I
would just doubt very much,'' Kampelman said.
   All 19 members of the Foreign Relations Committee signed on
Wednesday a letter to President Bush, asking him to seek a
clarification from the Soviet president about his foreign
minister's statement.
   Sen. Nancy L. Kassebaum, R-Kan., who helped organize the letter
writing effort, called the foreign minister's statement ``very
irresponsible'' because it could cause a lot of damage (to the
future of arms control) and throw a lot of and in everybody's
eyes.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden, R-Del., siad he believed Shevardnadze's
declaration was ``done out of whole cloth.''
   ``It flies in the face of what they have been doing and had that
kind of impact after all their cooing and wooing,'' he said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III held a
hurried-up meeting Thursday with West German Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg, who carried new proposals designed to avoid an
allied clash over short-range nuclear weapons at the upcoming NATO
summit.
   A diplomatic source familiar with Stoltenberg's proposals
confirmed that the West Germans are prepared to be more flexible on
the question of U.S.-Soviet negotiations over the weapons.
   The United States has opposed such talks, proposed last week by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, fearing that they could open
the way to stripping Western Europe of its short-range nuclear
weapons and leaving it vulnerable to the superior conventional
forces of the Warsaw Pact.
   West Germany wants such talks to begin and has proposed that
NATO delay modernizing its arsenal of short-range Lance missiles,
most of which are based in West Germany.
   The Bonn government's opposition to the weapons stems from the
fact they are designed for battlefield use, meaning that in time of
war they would most probably strike East and West Germany.
   The West Germans are now expressing the hope that an agreement
with the United States might be worked out within the next few
days, even though sharp differences remain eight days before
President Bush leaves for a critical NATO meeting in Paris.
   At the end of Thursday's talks, West German sources said
Stoltenberg had described his meeting with Baker as ``very useful''
and had said he was hopeful an agreement with the United States
could be reached by early next week. The source spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Although Baker and Stoltenberg had been scheduled to meet only
on Friday, an early Thursday session was arranged so that
Stoltenberg could confer with Baker at the beginning of the defense
minister's two-day visit, which is aimed at settling the bitter
dispute between Bonn and Washington.
   Stoltenberg also met for three hours with his counterpart,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher declined to comment
on the substance of Stoltenberg's talks with Baker, except to say
that the two touched on the short-range missile issue and on other
topics. Boucher said they planned to continue their talks with ``a
longer discussion'' on Friday.
   Stoltenberg's mission was to suggest a possible link between a
reduction of Soviet bloc conventional forces in Europe and the
start of negotiations between East and West on cutting back the
number of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Such negotiations might not begin until there is significant
progress in reducing European arsenals of conventional arms, where
the Warsaw Pact has a huge advantage.
   One proposal would be to form a high-level NATO study group to
examine how much ``significant progress'' would be necessary before
any U.S.-Soviet talks could convene, the diplomatic source said.
   Allowing such a study would give the NATO summit partners more
of a chance to resolve their differences.
   Baker has insisted the United States will stick to its position
that talks should first produce a reduction in Soviet bloc forces
in Europe to match NATO levels. Only then would the United States
be willing to consider discussing short-range missiles.
   Stoltenberg's visit came amid predictions from a group of West
German parliament members visiting Washington that an agreement
between Bonn and Washington will be ironed out prior to the NATO
summit.
   ``There's a new flexibility on both sides. The chances we will
reach an agreement are not 100 percent, but given the political
will, there's a good chance we will reach an agreement'' before the
NATO summit, said Volcker Ruehe, the deputy majority leader in
parliament, in a meeting with reporters.

   An explosion and fire at the German
Shell oil refinery in the port of Hamburg sent flames shooting 100
yards into the air Thursday and killed at least one worker,
authorities reported.
   Two others were injured by the explosion in a network of pipes
leading from the central pumping and mixing station, Shell manager
Siegmar Vetter said. He said the cause was being investigated.
   Firefighters said more than 100 tons of fuel spilled after the
explosion and fed the fire, which was brought under control after
four hours.
   The pumping station is in a tank farm, and intense heat created
the danger of further explosions, firefighters said.
   More than 200 firefighters went to the scene at the Elbe River
port. Thick black smoke from the fire swept over the city, but
authorities said no toxic substances were released.

<TEXT>
   Nursing home residents, their advocates and
state officials accused a government agency on Thursday of trying
to enforce nursing home reforms before it even spelled out how
those institutions could comply with the new rules.
   They said the Health Care Finance Administration put the cart
before the horse by issuing rules for enforcement of a 1987 reform
law without providing necessary guidelines for complying.
   ``We simply have been astounded by HCFA's delays in providing
education, information and guidance to the states on the important,
most timely, provisions of the law,'' Susan Rourke, president of
the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, told the
Senate Special Committee on Aging.
   ``It is a very difficult position for the states to be in
required by law to implement a program without regulatory guidance
and the probability that whatever we do may not be what the
regulations ultimately require,'' said Dana Petrowsky,
administrator of the Division of Health Facilities in Iowa's
Department of Inspections and Appeals.
   The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 obligated the
Department of Health and Human Services through HCFA to set
standards for quality of care, provide for protection of patients'
rights, and ensure minimum training of nurse's aides, who provide
most patient care in nursing homes.
   The legislation provided that the reforms be phased in over 2{
years.
   Experts in caring for the elderly said state agencies and health
care providers responsible for implementing the reforms have not
received from HCFA regulations for two major aspects of the
legislation _ nurse's aide training and evaluation and client
preadmission screening.
   Meanwhile HCFA issued final rules regarding nursing home survey
and certification requirements, including the inspection system to
be used, in February.
   C. Ross Anthony, associate administrator for program development
at HCFA, said much of the work to establish the standards had been
done before the reform law was passed so his agency decided to
proceed with enforcement regulations.
   ``We did not want to delay such important areas of reform as
enhanced residents rights and strengthened quality of care,'' he
said.
   G. Janet Tulloch, a resident of a Washington, D.C. nursing home,
said enactment of the law ``meant light at the end of a very dark
tunnel of subtle abuse.''
   But the waivers of nursing aide training and on-site nurses
requirements permitted under the rules HCFA propounded in February
``will allow the easiest solution wherever possible'' said the
65-year-old woman whose cerebal palsy has forced her to live in a
nursing home for 21 years.
   Congress wrote unusually detailed deadlines into the law because
of efforts by the Reagan administration to reduce federal
regulation of nursing homes despite widespread reports of abuse and
corruption.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., the committee chairman, questioned
whether the action by HCFA in issuing enforcement rules before it
issued guidelines was ``a back door attempt by HCFA to deregulate
nursing homes.''

   Police and soldiers broke up a battle
by two groups for control of a local section of the Petroleum
Workers Union in this oil producing center, and 78 people were
injured, officials said Thursday.
   One worker was in critical condition with a fractured skull, and
five more were hospitalized with broken bones, said Jose Luis
Bermudez, a spokesman for the state petroleum monopoly Pemex.
   Bermudez said Wednesday's brawl occurred at the union's Section
30, and he called it strictly a union dispute. He said the incident
did not affect Pemex operations in the large oilfield in Veracruz
state, on the Gulf of Mexico.
   Carlos Carvajal Lopez, state judicial police regional commander,
told the government newspaper El Nacional he had to call on a
nearby army post to help local police restore order.
   The dispute began March 7 when a dissident group led by Roberto
Reyes Betancourt claimed they won elections for control of Section
30, seized the building and barricaded themselves inside.
   Carvajal and Bermudez said that Wednesday morning an estimated
200 workers loyal to Ruben Amador Castro, who is backed by the
union's national executive council, tried to storm the building.
   The attackers were armed with rocks, picks and shovels and a
pitched battle followed, the officials said.
   No arrests were reported.
   Disputes in sections and locals have been frequent in the giant
union since Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, nicknamed La Quina, and a
group of 49 old-time leaders were arrested by federal agents in
January on charges of corruption and illegal possession of weapons.
   Five of the leaders were released for lack of evidence, and the
others are awaiting trial in Mexico City.

   Indian leaders in Oklahoma told a Senate
investigating committee Thursday their tribes are losing millions
of dollars each year because farmers and others won't relinquish a
stretch of valuable land the tribes own along the Arkansas River.
   ``It makes me ill every time I think of it to have 96 miles of
riverbed that belongs to the tribes, and we have no access,'' said
Hollis Roberts, chief of the Choctaw Nation.
   He said three-eighths of the acreage is Choctaw, one-eighth
Chickasaw and half Cherokee.
   More than 100 years ago, the federal government signed treaties
with the Indians that gave them the land. But in 1908, a year after
Oklahoma joined the Union, the Interior Department decided the land
belonged to the state.
   A Supreme Court decision in 1970 determined that the three
tribes always had title to the land. But by that time, it was being
used by farmers and others who believed they owned it.
   Now, in order for the Indians to get the land back, they must go
to court with land surveys showing which property is rightfully
theirs, said Wilma Mankiller, chief of the Cherokees.
   She, Roberts, and William Anoatubby, governor of the Chickasaws,
told the special committee of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs that they have urged the Bureau of Indian Affairs to
expedite the surveys, but have been unsuccessful.
   The special committee has been investigating all the agencies
that are supposed to be meeting the government's treaty obligations
to the Indians throughout the country.
   Mankiller said one of the problems in her tribe's case has been
a lack of money. She said Congress agreed in 1973 to provide
$440,000 a year for a five-year program to estimate the value of
the land and survey the land.
   Riverbed includes the channel in which a river formerly flowed.
   Only two years of the program were funded, resulting in the
survey of 700 acres, with 22,000 acres to be done.
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Congress could put some pressure
on the BIA to do the survey.
   ``We can tell BIA to do it out of available funds, or we can
give them some more money,'' he said. But he added that it would be
wise to put a deadline on the agency so the work would get done as
quickly as possible.
   The tribal leaders estimated that they could be getting more
than $1 million a year from the fertile riverbed land if it leased
the property to farmers.
   The sand and gravel along the river banks could bring in about
$20 million, said William Foster, attorney for the Cherokees. And,
the oil and gas beneath the surface is good for another several
million dollars a year, he said.
   Chief Roberts explained that the tribes own the land for about a
mile on each side of the Arkansas River. But over the years,
property owners farther up the banks have farmed all the way down
to the river because the land was vacant.
   When they sell their farms, they include the riverbed as part of
the property, he said.
   ``Many have leased out the property for oil and gas because they
believe they own the property,'' said Tina Jordan-Walker, attorney
for the Arkansas Riverbed Authority.
   Mankiller said that the tribes are interested in greater
self-sufficiency and have no natural resource in the area other
than the riverbed.
   ``To us, the Arkansas riverbed represents almost 80 years in
pursuit of rights in tribal lands at great cost in lost surface and
subsurface leasing revenues, sand and gravel resource destruction,
and litigation expenses,'' said Mankiller.
   ``We will not rest until we are fairly compensated for these
losses,'' she said.

   The biggest cheers for slogans being chanted at
massive pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing go to those calling
for senior leader Deng Xiaoping to step down.
   But all the sloganeers are striving for clever verses and catchy
rhythms to make their point.
   Protesters parade endlessly by the Great Hall of the People,
hard by the huge Tiananmen Square rallying site.
   One group stops to chant, ``Where has all the money gone? Gone
to feed them,'' gesturing toward the cavernous hall where Deng and
other leaders conduct much of their business.
   Widely popular when he began implementing rural economic reforms
a decade ago, the 84-year-old Deng _ 85 to the Chinese, who count
children as one year old when born _ is now the target of
disaffected students, workers and intellectuals.
   They hold him responsible for rampant government corruption and
stymied political reform.
   ``Xiaoping, get down from the stage,'' runs the most common
anti-Deng slogan seen during the protests so far.
   ``Xiaoping, your time has come,'' read a banner held aloft at
Tiananmen Square by workers from the No. 2 Beijing Shoe Factory.
   One chant pokes fun at Deng's well-known fondness for bridge.
   ``Xiaoping, Xiaoping, at 85 you're old.
   ``You're OK at cards, but your mind's no good.''
   Another takes a line from a song about Mao Tse-tung and adds one
about Deng:
   ``Chairman Mao is like the sun, wherever he shines it is bright.
   ``Deng Xiaoping is like the moon, whose phases come and go.''
   Bystanders cheered a truck bearing a cardboard sign that read,
``First go after the son,'' referring to Deng's son Pufang. A major
trading firm associated with the younger Deng's association for the
handicapped was reorganized because of corruption.
   ``The children of the people are starving,'' others sang out.
``What's Xiaoping's son doing?''
   Two Qinghua University students carried a banner demonstrating
the winds of change. In 1984, the banner said, ``Xiaoping, how are
you?'' But now a character had been added so it read: ``Xiaoping,
you are so cruel'' _ for not visiting students fasting on the
square since Saturday.
   Several signs recalled the memory of Chou En-lai, a beloved
statesman who died in 1972.
   ``Chou was a great premier for all the people,'' said Wang
Guangju of the Chinese Association of Industrial Associations as he
waved a portrait of Chou.
   ``We used to love Deng Xiaoping, but now there is corruption and
official extravagance in every part of the country, and we have no
democracy.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
unanimously adopted two amendments Thursday that would make it a
felony for government employees to solicit or divert money for
Iran-Contra-type activities.
   The proposed legislation stems from the congressional
investigation into allegations that proceeds of secret arms sales
to Iran during the Reagan administration were diverted to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The first provision would make it a felony for a federal
employee to solicit money to support foreign policy activities for
which Congress had prohibited funding. Violators could be
imprisoned for up to five years, or fined, or both.
   The second provision would bar government officials from
engaging in ``quid pro quo'' deals, in which foreign assistance
would be given to a country in exchange for that country's carrying
out an activity for which Congress had barred funding.
   The amendments, to the State Department authorization bill for
fiscal 1990, were introduced by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   ``I offer these amendments on behalf of our foreign service and
intelligence officers who all too often have been asked to violate
an imperative of the United States Constitution: To take care that
the laws be faithfully executed,'' Moynihan said.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
testify before Parliament next week on his links to an
influence-peddling scandal that brought down his successor, the
governing party said Thursday.
   The move by the Liberal Democratic Party is a concession to the
increasingly strident opposition, which has boycotted parliamentary
sessions to back demands that Nakasone testify.
   Prosecutors on Thursday searched the homes and offices of a key
former aide to the former prime minister and another
parliamentarian. The two politicians are suspected of taking bribes
to help Recruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate.
   Nakasone previously refused to testify before Parliament on the
issue, but Liberal Democratic officials said he will go before the
legislators next week, probably on Wednesday. He has denied
wrongdoing.
   Nakasone was prime minister in 1986, when 160 influential
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen _ including several
Nakasone aides _ purchased Recruit stock at a bargain price and
then quickly sold it after it went on the market for a much higher
price.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced on April 25 that he
would resign to take responsibility for the Recruit scandal. Polls
had shown support for Takeshita and his Liberal Democrats at
all-time lows.
   The opposition demand for Nakasone's testimony stiffened after
the Liberal Democrats rammed the fiscal 1989 budget through the
lower house in its absence. The quick vote on April 28 defied the
traditional Japanese emphasis on consensus.
   Aside from the stock deals, the opposition wants to question
Nakasone about help allegedly given to Recruit by Japan's
telecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   Former NTT Chairman Hisashi Shinto is among 14 businessmen and
bureaucrats arrested so far in the Recruit case.
   The two politicians' whose homes were searched Thursday were
also interrogated for two days by prosecutors. They are the first
elected officials against whom such formal legal action has been
taken.
   To arrest the two, prosecutors would need permission from
Parliament, since the legislature is now in session.
   The two are Takao Fujinami, an eight-term member of the House of
Representatives who was chief Cabinet secretary under Nakasone, and
Katsuya Ikeda of the opposition Komeito (Clean Government Party).
   Fujinami, 56, has acknowledged that an aide in 1986 bought
12,000 Recruit shares at a discounted price before the company's
stock was publicly traded. After public trading began, the stock
was sold for a profit of $191,000.
   Ikeda, 51, a four-term member of the House of Representatives,
said his brother bought 5,000 shares in the firm and gained $73,530
from the transaction.
   In both cases, the politicians denied personal involvement in
the transactions, although news reports said the bulk of the
profits had gone into their bank accounts.
   In all, Recruit sold bargain shares to about 160 influential
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.
   Ikeda said Tuesday that he would resign his Parliament seat.
Governing party officials denied reports that Fujinami also would
resign but indicated he might have to step down if he is formally
charged.
   The Liberal Democrats still are trying to find a new prime
minister who is untainted by the scandal.

   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., took a legislative
shot on Thursday at former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
now the head of a firm that provides counseling to foreign
governments and U.S. and overseas corporations.
   He persuaded the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to adopt
legislation requiring all members of the president's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board to disclose all income from foreign
governments or companies.
   Kissinger is a member of the advisory board.
   Helms, who opposed many of Kissinger's policies during his State
Department tenure, acknowleged that Kissinger was in fact the
principle target of the amendment, which was attached to the
pending State Department authorization bill.
   ``He's not king; he doesn't have to serve on this board,'' Helms
said of Kissinger. ``The government functioned before him and the
government will function after him.''
   ``Henry Kissinger has been up to his armpits in deals with
foreign countries,'' the North Carolina senator said.
   Much work remains on the bill to which the Helms amendement was
attached and it was unclear whether the provision would in fact
become law.

   The United States on Thursday condemned
apartheid in South Africa as ``innately inhuman,'' deplored
violence by both sides in Israel's occupied territories and cited
human rights abuses in Afghanistan, Panama and Romania.
   In the annual U.S. speech on human rights to a key U.N.
committee, Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering also alleged human rights
violations in Burma, Cuba and Iran.
   Pickering made no mention of the Soviet Union and China, where
the United States previously has expressed deep concern over human
rights practices including China's harsh handling of unrest in
Tibet.
   The former ambassador to Israel called for restraint ``by all
parties'' in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We regret and deplore the violence in the occuied territories
from all sides,'' he told the Second Committee of the U.N. Economic
and Social Council. Pickering said the United States opposes some
Israeli practices, including the use of excessive force to maintain
order, administrative detentions, deportations and the destruction
and sealing of homes of suspects without due process.
   The U.S. envoy began his speech with a denunciation of
Pretoria's segregationist policies, known as apartheid. He said the
South African government ``sponsors and enforces arrangements for
systematic discrimination, asserting that the color of one's skin
makes some human beings superior to others. This premise is
innately inhuman.''
   Pickering said the United States wants to see a new
constitutional order based on equality, a democratic electoral
system based on universal franchise and effective constitutional
guarantees of basic human rights.
   In Afghanistan, he said, there remains overwhelming evidence of
massive violations of human rights carried out by the Kabul
government. These include political killings, disappearances,
torture, summary executions, arbitrary arrests and imprisonment
under unacceptable conditions, he said.
   Pickering also noted that in Panama,``recent, highly regrettable
events'' illustrated ``the overwhelming importance of national
institutions which ensure universal and equal suffrage.''
   He cited need for independent supervision of elections, fair
voter registration, reliable balloting prcedures and means to
prevent electoral fraud and resolve disputes.
   Panama's de facto ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega declared
last week's elections in Panama null and void after his supporters
beat opposition candidates. Observers reported widespread evidence
of fraud on the part of Noriega'ssupporters.
   Despite a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war, Pickering said,
the human rights situation in Iran has not improved. He cited
hundreds of political executions that began late last year.
   Pickering criticized Romania for declaring in Vienna in January
that it would not be bound by certain provisions of the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Bucharest has rejected human rights inquiries from the United
States and other Western nations.

   Federal examiners discovered new evidence of
fraud in nearly one in four of the 219 savings institutions taken
over by the government so far this year, regulators told the Bush
administration Thursday.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in a report to the Treasury
Department, said that since beginning the takeover of the nation's
most deeply insolvent S&amp;Ls on Feb. 7, its examiners have uncovered
potential criminal violations in about 50 institutions and referred
the cases to the Justice Department.
   That's in addition to possible fraud already uncovered by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which previously had responsibility
for the institutions.
   James Dudine, director of the FDIC's anti-fraud effort, said
there are indications of crime at as many as half of the 219
institutions put under government control in preparation for the
enactment of President Bush's S&amp;L bailout plan.
   Dudine said that many of the Justice Department referrals
involved additional evidence in previously known cases rather than
entirely new cases. More than half of the new evidence was
uncovered in Texas S&amp;Ls, he said.
   In a typical fraud case, an S&amp;L official has an undisclosed
interest in a a commercial real estate project that received a loan
from the institution and couldn't repay it, Dudine said.
   Under Bush's S&amp;L reform proposals, the FDIC, which insures
deposits at commercial banks, would also get that responsibility
for S&amp;Ls. While Congress debates the proposal, the FDIC, under
Bush's orders, is taking over the worst S&amp;Ls, cataloging their
losses, looking for fraud and preparing them for sale to private
investors.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman told reporters that accumulated
losses at the S&amp;Ls under supervision by April 15 totaled $29.8
billion, representing 40 percent of the institutions' combined
assets of $73.4 billion.
   The agency plans to take control of about 60 more institutions
by July, bringing the total assets to $115.5 billion.
   The nearly $30 billion in losses is in line with the estimates
of the Bush administration, which hopes to spend $50 billion to
close all institutions now insolvent or that slip into insolvency
in the next three years, roughly 500.
   Seidman said the $50 billion should be enough because the failed
institutions not yet under government control are in better shape.
   ``From what we know now, this is enough money. ... If things get
worse, it clearly won't be enough money,'' he said.
   Seidman defended his agency against charges it is allowing
institutions under its control to pay high interest rates, thus
hurting solvent S&amp;Ls trying to compete for deposits.
   ``Why don't we order them to pay less? Of course we can do that,
but if we did, they wouldn't get the deposits they need to fund
themselves,'' Seidman said.
   The FDIC estimated that the thrifts under its control have lost
$3.4 billion in deposits, but Seidman said he expected the outflow
to taper off if interest rates remain stable or decline as some
economists predict.
   On another matter, the FDIC acknowledged that its had to cut
back on supervision of commercial banks and after assigning 1,029
employees to the failed S&amp;Ls. Seidman said bank examinations since
the start of February are down 22 percent from the same period a
year ago. Nevertheless, he said the agency expects to complete
about 4,100 bank examinations this year, up from 4,019 from in 1988.

<HEAD>Arens Says U.S. Backs Proposal for Elections Among Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said
Thursday that he has obtained a ``very large measure'' of support
from U.S. officials for his government's controversial proposal to
hold elections among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   ``There is a very large degree of understanding and a very large
measure of agreement on the issues we discussed,'' Arens said after
a 45-minute meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``I think we have a commmitment of the administration here to
support ... the entire initiative,'' Arens said.
   But a U.S. official said that while the Israeli plan had
``promising possibilities, much work needs to be done.'' The
official, speaking on condition he not be named, said the United
States had been ``looking at what opportunities it affords and what
questions remain to be answered.''
   Baker told Arens the next step would be for Israel to start
talks with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on details
for the elections and what conditions would be acceptable to each
side, said the U.S. official. ``They need to talk directly to each
other on that,'' he said.
   Arens told reporters he had not discussed details of the plan
which was adopted this week by the Israeli government and
parliament either with Baker or with National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft.
   ``I don't think we should get sidetracked at the present time in
talking about this or that detail,'' he said.
   Israeli sources say the United States is pressing Israel to give
answers to several points raised by Baker in a letter to Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir last week regarding details of the
election blueprint.
   Specifically, the United States wants Israel to say whether it
will agree to international supervision of the elections among the
1.7 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
whether the Palestinians living in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem
would be allowed to vote.
   According to the sources, who spoke only on condition they not
be named, the United States asked Shamir for the answers by the end
of June.
   Arens denied Baker had pressed him for details. ``It wasn't
pushed at all,'' he said.
   Arens said he had urged the Bush administration to grant
``wholehearted and unreserved American support for this peace
initiative.'' Such support, he said, ``has a good chance of
enlisting support among other countries throughout the world, and
eliciting a positive reaction from the Arab world, and that is a
necessary precondition for this thing to really take off.''
   Israel also would like the U.S. endorsement in order to deflect
criticism from hardliners at home who say the plan will ultimately
lead to creation of a Palestinian state _ anathema to most Israelis.
   The plan envisions elections of Palestinians who would negotiate
with Israel for limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Following several years of self-rule, Israel would then engage in
talks on the future of the lands which it captured from Egypt and
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The plan excludes any participation by representatives of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and Egyptian leader Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein have said they would not accept
it unless the PLO approves.
   State Department envoy Dennis Ross shuttled among Israel, Jordan
and Egypt earlier this week and reported on his talks Thursday to
Baker and Arens.
   As Arens and Baker discussed the situation in the territories,
especially the Palestinian uprising of the past 17 months in which
more than 480 Palestinians have been killed, some 30 protesters
marched outside the State Department building shouting ``Long Live
PLO.''
   In a move to end the demonstration before Arens emerged,
security officials drove away the cars of the official motorcade as
though to indicate Arens would be spirited away through another
entrance. But soon after the protesters dispersed, the cars came
back and Arens came out and spoke to reporters.
   At a meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney earlier, Arens
described a recent escalation of Palestinian attacks against
Israelis and against Arabs perceived as collaborators with Israeli
authorities, the sources said. Arens told Cheney that by
maintaining its official contacts with the PLO begun last year, the
United States was encouraging the Palestinians to continue their
attacks.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Promises $400,000 to FCC to preven Furloughs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Senate appropriations subcommittee freed up
enough new money Thursday to prevent the Federal Communications
Commission from having to close its doors for two days this year.
   But the panel made no promises to fund a 10 percent increase for
the commission in 1990.
   The appropriations subcommittee on the departments of Commerce,
Justice and State, the Judiciary and related agencies said the FCC
could have about $400,000 the government received from Florida as
compensation for moving an FCC monitoring station in Fort
Lauderdale to make way for a new highway.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick, in a second day of congressional
testimony on the agency's 1990 appropriation request, told the
panel the commission needs $495,000 or it will have to furlough all
its employees for two days.
   Congress gave the FCC $99.6 million in this fiscal year that
ends Sept. 30, the same amount the commission received in 1988. The
agency went over budget this year, Patrick said, because of
federally mandated increases in salaries and benefits.
   Patrick had told a House appropriations subcommittee on March 7
that the shortfall would be $890,000, or 3{ furlough days. But
Thursday he said more employees than expected had taken advantage
of early retirement programs, leave without pay or shortened their
work schedules.
   FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said the agency could avoid the
furloughs if it received $400,000.
   ``Through attrition and other cutbacks, it looks like we're
going to come out fine by the end of the year,'' she said following
the hearing.
   Patrick estimated the agency would have 1,620 full-time
permanent employees by Oct. 1, the beginning of fiscal 1990. That
would be 20 percent below staffing levels in the early 1980s, he
said.
   Therefore, Patrick said, the agency's backlog in processing
license applications has grown.
   He said the FCC needs the full $109.8 million requested by the
White House, a 10 percent increase, to pay for 1,889 full-time
employees, new computer and monitoring equipment, increased
salaries and benefits and travel expenses to keep up with explosive
growth in the telecommunications industry.
   ``We simply have not had the funds necessary to maintain our
speed of service in processing applications,'' Patrick said.
   A subcommittee aide, Warren Kane, said the panel was sympathetic
to Patrick's budget request.
   ``We don't find a whole lot to dispute them on that,'' Kane said
in an interview following the hearing. ``The problem is, how far
can we go on the current budget resolution?''
   The House on Wednesday passed a $1.17 trillion federal budget
resolution that reflects a $28 billion deficit-reduction deal the
Bush administration and congressional leaders reached last month.
The Senate worked on the measure Thursday.
   Subcommittee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., told Patrick
that job attrition could be expected at the FCC since the agency
has eased or abandoned some regulatory oversight.
   Peratino of the FCC said that even though subcommittee members
made no promises regarding 1990 funds, ``I think we'll do better
than we did this year.''
   Patrick also made a pitch for a proposal to auction off new
licenses to the highest bidder, a system he said would reap $3.38
billion for the U.S. Treasury.

   Moderates made a strong showing
on both banks of the Protestant-Catholic divide in Northern
Ireland's local elections, TV projections and partial returns
showed Thursday.
   With half the 566 seats on 26 district councils declared, gains
were forecast on the Roman Catholic side for the Democratic and
Labor Party and a patchy result for Sinn Fein, the legal political
wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   Among the Protestants, who outnumber Catholics 3-2, heavy losses
were projected for Rev. Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionist
Party.
   Four candidates who won in affluent, Protestant North Down ran
as Conservatives in an effort to lure Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's party into the fray.
   The hopes of Sinn Fein, which backs the IRA war against British
rule in the province, hung on the vote from its Belfast stronghold,
to be counted Friday.
   Ulster TV forecast a 5 percent drop for Paisley's party to 19.4
percent, and a 2.7-percent gain for its more moderate rival, the
Official Unionists, to 32.6 percent.
   It projected a 1.6 percent gain for SDLP moderates to 19.4
percent, and a 3 percent fall for Sinn Fein to 8.8 percent.
   A BBC-TV projection gave the SDLP 20.6 percent, and Sinn Fein
11.1 percent.
   ``Everywhere we stood our vote has gone up very well,'' said
SDLP leader John Hume.
   But the slow hand-count and the complex proportional
representation system meant surprises could still come before the
two-day tally is complete.
   The SDLP looked set for its best local election performance, but
was in no mood to write off Sinn Fein.
   ``There seems to be a fairly uniform pattern of marginal decline
in the Sinn Fein vote in the rural areas. It may not be reflected
in Belfast,'' said the SDLP's Alban Maginnis.
   Danny McGuinness of the Alliance, the province's only mixed
Catholic-Protestant party, said the election appeared to reflect
``a shift toward the center parties, away from the DUP and Sinn
Fein.''
   ``I think that for long time people wanted to see some movement
in politics in Northern Ireland,'' he said.
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams blamed his party's showing on a
government ban on broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein members. But
he admitted that a series of bungled IRA attacks that killed
innocent bystanders may also have alienated voters.
   ``The censorship factor, our own organization ... and perhaps
the IRA factor, have all contributed perhaps in preventing Sinn
Fein from advancing its vote,'' he said.
   But ``our aim was to consolidate our vote and we appear to be
doing that,'' he said.
   Sinn Fein's vote looked solid in its urban strongholds, but down
in many rural areas.
   In Enniskillen, where a IRA bomb killed 11 Protestants in 1987,
Sinn Fein local leader Paul Corrigan's vote fell from 2,360 to
1,781 _ a setback in a sparsely populated rural district.
   Paisley said his party's losses reflected a Protestant community
split between those west of the Bann River who are more exposed to
IRA attack than those in urban areas east of the Bann.
   ``Many of our (urban) voters did not come out and stand with our
harassed brothers and sisters on the other side of the Bann,'' he
said.
   But his Official Unionist opponents said the reason was a
militant Paisley-led campaign against the 1985 Anglo-Irish
Agreement.
   That accord, signed by Britain and Ireland, gave Dublin a say in
the running of the province and provoked overwhelming outrage from
the Protestant majority, which regards Ireland as a hostile,
Catholic-dominated state.
   But where the Official Unionists opted for lawful, peaceful
protest, the Democratic Unionists tried boycotts and civil
disobedience.
   Official Unionist John Taylor said the election showed his
party's opposition ``directed within the law, has won widespread
consent.
   ``We have now advanced beyond 30 percent of public support which
is a great barrier to break through, and it looks as though ... we
will also get more than 200 seats for the first time, which is
excellent news,'' he said.
   But the Democratic Unionists' Sammy Wilson said his party lost
support for not resisting the Anglo-Irish Agreement vigorously
enough.
   ``People who are impatient with the campaign against the
agreement on the whole feel we should have been rid of the
agreement that much quicker,'' he said.
   The Belfast Conservatives say it is the failure of mainland
British parties to campaign in Northern Ireland that leaves the
field open to local politicians to run politics on sectarian lines.

   A ship that is to carry a team of
explorers to Antarctica set sail for New York on Thursday on the
first part of its voyage, organizers said.
   The ceremonial departure of the high-tech polar ship UAP took
place on Sunday, but after some tests at sea the crew returned
quietly to port when some minor parts and repairs were needed,
skipper Jean Collet said.
   The silver ship left this Normandy port about 8 p.m. under clear
skies, the organizers said.
   After the New York stop, the UAP will head for King George
Island, from where the adventurers will launch the first
unmechanized trek across the vast frozen continent.
   The operation is being organized by Will Steger of Ely, Minn.,
who in 1986 led the first unsupported dogsled trek to the North
Pole since Adm. Robert Peary, and Frenchman Jean-Louis Etienne, the
first man to ski alone to the North Pole.
   The team is to leave King George Island on Aug. 1 and spend
seven months crossing about 4,000 miles of ice and snow with their
dogs, arriving at the Soviet Mirnyy base in March.
   Organizers are hoping to draw attention to threats against the
Antarctic environment and the need for increased international
cooperation to protect it.
   The polar ship, built for $3.17 million, is 117 feet long and 32
feet wide. It was christened in a ceremony Saturday.
   Other members of the team include Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet
Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, glaciologist Qin Dahe of
China, Geoff Somers of Britain and Keizo Funatsu of Japan.
   Most of the explorers will join the ship later in the
expedition, rather than participating in the Atlantic crossing.

<TEXT>
   A meeting of the Communist Party
Central Committee ended Thursday in disagreement over what to do
about Kosovo, a province bordering Albania that has been torn by
ethnic conflict.
   No vote was taken on a prepared resolution because too few of
the 165 members remained after 16 hours of quarrelsome debate.
Voting requires a quorum of at least 110 members, but only 101 were
present.
   The argument was between those, generally Serbs, who support
tough measures against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo and
liberals who prefer more democratic methods.
   Kosovo, the ancient heartland of Serbia, is an autonomous
province within the Serbian republic. Ethnic Albanians now make up
85 percent of the population, and the remaining Serbs claim
discrimination.
   Last spring, the national government imposed a state of
emergency and curfew in the province after more than 60,000 ethnic
Albanians rioted in protest of constitutional amendments that gave
Serbia more control. At least 25 people were killed, including two
policemen.
   Intellectuals, dissidents and the liberal opposition have
criticized the state of emergency, the jailing of more than 800
ethnic Albanians and detention of at least 200 people without
charge.
   Enver Sehovic, a Central Committee member from Croatia, the
second-largest republic after Serbia, denounced ``isolating people
at an unknown location for an indefinite term and without
possibility of legal protection.''
   He said such repressive measures and purges of ethnic Albanian
``intellectuals, businessmen, workers and young people'' in Kosovo
caused ``revulsion'' in the West.
   Sehovic compared the action of the Yugoslav army and police in
Kosovo to the ``brotherly assistance'' of Soviet soldiers who
invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush liberal reforms.
   Dobrivoje Vidic of Serbia said Sehovic's statements were
``inadmissible'' and that the Yugoslav army ``represents the
instrument of the people in the struggle for freedom and
independence.''
   At 1 a.m., the Central Committee adjourned with members angrily
accusing each other of ignorance about events in Kosovo and
elsewhere.
   The official news agency Tanjug said in a commentary: ``The fact
that 40 percent of the delegates were absent at the end ... speaks
clearly about their choice between going home and reaching an
agreement on the Kosovo issue.''

<HEAD>Crack Specter Hangs Over Europe, Says Cabinet Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europe faces a crack epidemic that could be as bad
as any plague of the Middle Ages, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told
a 19-nation conference on narcotics Thursday.
   ``This is a plague we are visiting on ourselves,'' said the
minister, whose department is responsible for police, prisons and
immigration.
   ``Crack is the specter I see hanging over Europe. If crack ever
becomes deeply rooted in Europe the outlook will indeed be bleak.''
   Hurd addressed the opening session of a two-day meeting of
Western European governments in the Council of Europe.
   Ministers met to discuss increased cooperation in fighting
narcotics and were told by Hurd they must ``work together
urgently'' to make sure the experience of drug abuse in the United
States is not repeated in Europe.
   Crack is a cheap, smokable form of cocaine that gives an
instant, intense high as the drug goes straight to the brain.
   But the effect wears off after a few minutes, and a lingering,
deep depression follows.
   Hurd noted that crack was unheard of in the United States before
1985 but is now a major drug there.
   He said 75 percent of the people who used crack three times
became addicted to it.
   ``Because the use of crack is accompanied by feelings of
omnipotence and paranoia, the behavior which results has devastated
family life in the United States. Figures of child abuse have
soared and so have attacks on the police,'' the secretary said.
   Hurd pleaded for international cooperation to ensure traffickers
or their profits have no hiding place.
   ``The North American market having been saturated, the cocaine
barons of Latin America are now driving their product into
Europe,'' he said.
   ``The traffickers are in it for the money. If they stand a good
chance of losing the money, wherever it is stashed, the incentive
disappears.''
   Hurd said Britain was giving $810,000 to the United Nations for
anti-narcotics operations and an additional $3.2 million for
equipment and training of law enforcement agencies in countries
along the cocaine supply route from Latin America to Europe.
   Hurd said figures supplied by the Paris-based international
police organization, Interpol, showed that cocaine seized in Europe
increased from 341 pounds in 1978 to nearly 5{ tons last year.
   He said two laboratories were dismantled in Italy and about 590
pounds of coca base and cocaine hydrochloride seized there.
   ``This event indicates without doubt that large-scale conversion
of coca base into cocaine is under way in Europe. There is
evidence, too, of cooperation between criminal organizations in
Colombia and Italy,'' Hurd said.
   He invited other countries to follow Britain's example in
signing bilateral agreements to confiscate money from trafficking.
There are such agreements with the United States, Canada, Bahamas,
Australia and Switzerland, and negotiations or approaching signings
with Spain, Sweden, Italy, France and the Netherlands.
   Barry Sheerman, the home affairs spokesman of Britain's
opposition Labor Party, criticized Hurd for ignoring police pleas
to provide cash to reward drug-ring informers.
   ``The only way to beat these gangs is to get high levels of
inside information,'' Sheerman said.

<HEAD>PLO Expels West German Relief Workers From Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO expelled four West German relief
workers from their base in a refugee camp Thursday because it said
they concealed the identity of those who kidnapped members of their
group this month.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization also said the workers from
the ASME-Humanitas group at the Mieh Mieh camp had ignored security
regulations. It did not elaborate.
   ``We gave them 60 minutes to pack and leave,'' said Abu Ali
Wajih, in charge of security for all the Palestinian refugee camps
in Lebanon. ``We don't want to have anything to do with them
anymore.''
   The four West Germans were taken in a PLO car to Sidon, where
they were met by members of the Nasserite Militia and taken to
another base the group keeps in Aaqbiyeh, controlled by the Shiite
Amal militia. It was not immediately known how long they would stay
in Lebanon.
   The West German captives, Heinrich Struebig, 48, an
administrator, and Thomas Kemptner, 28, a male nurse, were
kidnapped along with nurse Petra Schnitzler on Tuesday.
   Ms. Schnitzler was freed a few hours later when a local militia
stopped the kidnappers' car, thinking it was a gang of thieves.
   Both Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler had been kidnapped along with
Markus Quint, also a West German, May 4. She and Struebig were
released the next day to transmit demands by the kidnappers seeking
a lenient sentence for convicted terrorist Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem.
   On Wednesday, a Frankfurt court sentenced Hamadi to life in
prison for air piracy and murder in connection with the 1985 TWA
hijacking during which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   ASME-Humanitas has seven workers serving mainly the Palestinian
camps.
   Quint was freed on Sunday. Nabih Berri, whose Shiite Moslem
militia controls most of southern Lebanon beyond Sidon, took credit
for the release and pledged to provide greater protection.
   Ms. Schnitzler said Thursday that ASME-Humanitas headquarters
had not asked the relief workers to leave.
   But West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said
the West German government had asked the group 15 times in writing
to pull out.
   Besides the two West Germans, at least 16 foreigners are missing
and believed held hostage in Lebanon.

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting broke out Thursday between
loyal and mutinous troops in Eritrea, a Western diplomat said, and
rebels in the province lent support to those trying to overthrow
President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The diplomat said the 2nd Army's commanding general, a leader of
the military revolt that began Tuesday, had been killed in the
factional fighting.
   The 2nd Army had been considered in full opposition to Mengistu,
and the fighting with loyalists inside the 2nd Army represented
what the diplomat, based in Addis Ababa, called ``a dramatic turn.''
   Mengistu said in a broadcast Thursday night that ``a few of the
conspiracy's collaborators attempted to continue the betrayal,''
but the 2nd Army ``has today crushed the traitors ... and has
brought the situation under full control.''
   In his first public comment since since returning Wednesday from
an abbreviated trip to East Germany, Mengistu said his
``revolutionary forces will liquidate'' the mutineers.
   He blamed the uprising ``on a few generals'' who placed their
``greed and hunger for power'' above the natonal interest. The
revolt is the most serious challenge to Mengistu's 15-year-old rule
in Ethiopia, the Soviet Union's closest ally in Africa.
   The diplomat said loyal soldiers at least temporarily recaptured
the radio station in Asmara, capital of the northern province, and
broadcast a statement declaring loyalty to the Marxist government.
   ``The radio station then went dead,'' he said, which suggested
continued fighting between loyalists and mutineers in Ethiopia's
second largest city. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A few hours before the report of fighting within the 2nd Army,
the Eritrean People's Liberation Front declared it was suspending
its 28-year-old war of secession to support the mutineers.
   The diplomat said the factional fighting ``may be a backlash
against the rapprochement with the EPLF.''
   Voice of the Masses of Eritrea, the rebel radio, announced a
unilateral, two-week cease-fire ``to facilitate the successful
outcome'' of the military revolt. The clandestine station reported
earlier that rebel leaders had met with 2nd Army commanders and
``discussed the best way to intensify the struggle.''
   Mutineers have not stated an ideology or political goals beyond
ousting Mengistu. The government and Eritrean rebels both espouse
Marxism.
   On Thursday night, the radio reported fighting ``among Ethiopian
army units in and around Asmara'' and reiterated rebel ``readiness
to give any kind of support and cooperation'' to the mutineers.
   It offered ``the entire area under the control of the EPLF as a
fallback zone'' for the mutinous troops. The radio also reported
renewed fighting in Addis Ababa, but the diplomat said there had
been no shooting in Addis Ababa.
   Any alliance between the Eritrean rebels and a fully rebellious
2nd Army would remove all government control from Ethiopia's
northernmost province, its only avenue to the Red Sea, and
presumably force Mengistu to negotiate.
   The rebels control three-fourths of the countryside in Eritrea,
and the army generally is confined to garrisons in the cities,
including Asmara.
   The diplomat said the counterrevolt within the 2nd Army, which
numbers about 150,000 men, was led by a tank brigade and a
paratrooper unit. He identified the slain commander as Denissie
Bulto, a ``key ringleader'' in the plot against Mengistu.
   State radio said Thursday that Industry Ministry Fanta Belai had
been arrested as one of the plotters. He formerly commanded the air
force.
   Mengistu's defense minister, Maj. Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte
Mariam, and at least two rebellious generals have been killed.
   Unconfirmed reports said a fourth coup leader, Maj. Gen.
Kumalafchew Dejene, the deputy commander of armed forces in
Eritrea, was hunted down Wednesday and killed by loyalist soldiers.
   Government troops have been completely forced out of neighboring
Tigre Province by rebels of the Tigre People's Liberation Front,
who want more autonomy in their area.
   Although their aims are different, the rebel groups occasionally
combine forces and in the past year dealt the government several
humiliating defeats. Tigrean rebels also have voiced support for
the dissident soldiers.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies
puts the strength of the Ethiopian army at 315,000, that of
Eritrean rebels at 30,000 men and Tigrean rebels at 20,000. All the
forces have tanks and artillery.
   In addition, air force units assigned to the north had about
half the government's estimated 140 MiG fighter jets and bombers.
   It is not known which side the air force units took, but the
dissident soldiers were reported in control of Asmara's airport,
and the government has warned civilian pilots not to fly over the
city.
   Mengistu inherited the 28-year-old northern civil war when he
and a clique of army officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie on
Sept. 12, 1974.
   Eritrea is a former Italian colony that was federated with
Ethiopia in 1957 under a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution. Haile
Selassie annexed the territory in 1962.

   Foreigners with AIDS will be allowed to seek
30-day visas to enter this country on business, attend conferences
or visit relatives, the Justice Department said Thursday.
   New regulations to be issued by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service allowing such travel were drafted following
last month's dispute over the detention of a Dutch AIDS patient en
route to a conference in San Francisco on the deadly disease, said
department spokesman David Runkel.
   Runkel said AIDS patients will not be granted tourist visas but
would be allowed apply to enter the country for 30-day periods to
attend conferences, obtain medical treatment, visit relatives or
conduct business.
   The regulations were drafted by INS after a federal immigration
judge ruled last month that the agency should allow a Dutch AIDS
patient to attend the conference in San Francisco.
   Hans Paul Verhoef, 31, of Rotterdam, was detained in Minneapolis
after U.S. Customs Service inspectors at local airport found the
drug AZT in his luggage. Verhoef then admitted to INS agents that
he had AIDS.
   The Justice Department did not appeal the immigration judge's
ruling that the INS should have granted Verhoef a waiver of
exclusion to attend the conference because he posed only a minimal
risk of spreading the disease.
   For years, INS has asked foreigners seeking to enter this
country to state whether they have a contagious or dangerous
disease. Affliction with a variety of contagious diseases may be a
ground for refusing to admit an alien either as a tourist or as a
permanent resident.
   Congress specifically empowered INS in 1987 to exclude aliens
who have AIDS, which was added to the list of diseases
traditionally considered by INS as a basis for exclusion.
   The new regulations are being issued in advance of the 5th
International Conference on AIDS scheduled for June 4-9 in Montreal.
   Organizers of the 1990 conference, scheduled to be held in San
Francisco, have asked Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to consider
easing restrictions to allow AIDS patients to attend the meetings.
   Gay organizations also expressed concern about people traveling
through the United States en route to the Montreal conference, said
Urvashi Vaid, a spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force.
   The new rules were called ``a ludicrous policy'' by Pat
Christen, policy director for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation,
which has sought to delete AIDS and the HIV virus that causes the
disease from the list of contagions for which aliens can be
excluded.
   ``There is no reason to believe that a tourist poses any more
public health threat than a business person,'' she said. ``People
with HIV infection are not casually contagious and are not going to
go around transmitting the disease,'' she said.
   ``It's a disease of consenting adults. We don't need to worry
about foreign invaders with this infection,'' she added.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on
Thursday ruled out goodwill gestures to improve conditions in the
occupied territories and encourage Palestinians to accept Israel's
peace plan.
   Speaking on the eve of a 10-day visit to the United States,
Rabin said Israel was not now ready to release prisoners, reopen
universities and public schools or take other measures to improve
the climate amid the 17-month uprising by Palestinians in the
occupied lands.
   ``The present situation leaves no room for gestures,'' Rabin
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Rabin pecifically ruled out releasing large numbers of the 6,300
Palestinian security prisoners or reopening 11 Palestinian
universities and colleges in the West Bank with a total enrollment
of 17,000. They have been closed since February 1988.
   He said two attempts were made to restart classes at 1,194 grade
schools and high schools in the West Bank. But he said violent
clashes immediately began between students and soldiers.
   ``Once the schools were closed there was a sharp reduction in
the number of youngsters who were injured or worse,'' he said.
   Rabin suggested Israel might be willing to show flexibility on
the participation of 140,000 East Jerusalem Arabs, international
supervision and other unresolved questions about elections if
Palestinians first indicated agreement in principle to Israel's
proposal.
   ``If there will be acceptance in principle of (the plan) by
Palestinians in the territories we can go on and tackle other
problems which are related to the matter of elections,'' he said.
   Israel's plan calls for elections to chose Palestinian
representatives to negotiate a self-rule scheme for the 1.5 million
residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations on a
permanent solution would start only after three years.
   The PLO Executive Committee rejected the Israeli plan, adopted
by the Cabinet on Sunday, as a ``farce.'' Most prominent
Palestinians in the occupied territories were also critical, saying
the plan failed to deal with Palestinian aspirations for an
independent state.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in an interview on Israel
television, made clear he sees the plan as a way to prevent the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
   Asked if he believed the plan would lead to such a state, Shamir
replied: ``If I thought so I would not have proposed the plan. I
feel that the plan is our best weapon for fighting this.''
   Shamir told his right-wing Likud bloc Wednesday that Israel
would ``not give an inch'' of land to the Arabs as part of a
permament solution.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Thursday after meeting
Secretary of State James Baker in Washington that the Bush
administration supported the Israeli election plan. But U.S.
officials said many questions remained, such as who would be
allowed to participate.
   Rabin met with two groups of Palestinians from the occupied
lands this week to explain the government's peace proposals. He
conceded their views reflected the negative comments made publicly
by other Palestinians. But he said there was more of a sense of
urgency about finding a solution among local Palestinians.
   ``They would like to see the light at the end of the tunnel
while the (PLO) people who reside in the villas of Tunisia can wait
10 to 15 years. The urgency here is greater than outside. At the
same time no doubt they would not dare to go it alone,'' he said.
   He said Israel would be willing to wait three to six months for
a definitive Palestinian answer before giving up on the initiative.
In the meantime, he said Israel counted on the United States to
help persuade international and Arab opinion of the plan's worth.
   Palestinians would not be barred from running in the elections
because they wanted an independent Palestinian state or supported
the PLO, Rabin said, adding the only criteria would be the advocacy
of violence.
   ``Anyone who calls for violence against Israel cannot be a
candidate for elections,'' he said.
   But Rabin said Israel's two major parties, Likud and Labor, were
irrevocably split on whether Israel should trade land for peace.
   ``There is no government position on what should be on the
boundaries or the form of the permanent peace,'' he said.
   He argued that because of the division the only course open was
a two-step process that postponed talks on a permanent solution.
   ``We hope the new realities we offer for a transition period (of
self-rule) will create a new atmosphere and more confidence that
can bring one of the two (Israeli) sides to change its position,''
said Rabin.
   In talks on a permament settlement, Palestinian and Jordanian
negotiators could propose any solution they desire, including
demands for Palestinian statehood.
   Rabin called on Palestinians to adopt a realistic position,
saying past peace efforts failed because of maximalist demands.
   ``In the past, and unfortunately in certain circles even today,
(the Arabs) try a policy of everything or nothing. And they have
remained in the past 40 years with nothing.
   ``They should start to become reasonable and learn that complex
issues cannot be solved by miracles and `open sesame' solutions,''
he said.

   A Cook County grand jury refused to indict a man
who disconnected his brain-damaged, comatose son from life support
and held hospital workers at gunpoint until the boy died,
authorities said Thursday.
   Rudy Linares, 23, a house painter from Cicero, was charged by
the state's attorney's office with murder in the April 26 death of
his 15-month-old son, Samuel.
   But after the grand jury action, the state's attorney's office
announced Thursday it would not prosecute the charge.
   ``I'm glad it's more or less behind me now,'' Linares said. ``I
want to thank everybody that sent me cards, letters, their prayers,
moral support.''
   He said he and his wife ``just want to go home and spend some
time together.''
   Linares pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use
of a weapon and was sentenced by Circuit Judge Robert Bastone to
one year conditional discharge, meaning he will serve no time in
jail, said Dan McCullough, spokesman for State's Attorney Cecil
Partee.
   ``As far as punishment is concerned,'' Bastone said Thursday,
``I think you have suffered enough.''
   ``The case of Rudy Linares has been a unique, frustrating and
troubling one,'' Partee said. ``His actions in removing his son
from a respirator, while armed with a loaded revolver, were
simultaneously inappropriate under the law, yet understandable from
the standpoint of a parent.''
   A conditional discharge means Linares can go free provided he is
given a psychological evaluation and that he get counseling if
authorities recommend it.
   After the hearing, Partee reiterated his plan to form a task
force of medical, legal and religious representatives to analyze
the issues presented by the case and seek appropriate legislation.
   Linares' son had been in an irreversible coma since August, when
he accidentally swallowed a balloon.
   ``Sammy Linares died ... nine months ago, and ...whatever
occurred between then and three weeks ago could not change that,''
said Kevin Smith, trial supervisor for the public defender's office
and one of Linares' three attorneys.
   Authorities said Linares pulled his son from a life-support
system at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center and, holding
a .357-caliber gun, cradled the boy in his arms until the baby died.
   ``I did it because I loved my son,'' Linares told reporters
after arrest.
   The hospital last year refused to comply with a request from the
Linares family for a withdrawal of life support from their son.
Hospital lawyer Max Brown said the youngster wasn't brain dead and
such a move could have left doctors open to criminal charges.
   Authorities say Linares also had unhooked his son's life-support
system during a December visit, but that staff members immediately
re-attached the boy's ventilator and did not notify police.
   The grand jury began its investigation three weeks ago.
   Medical Examiner Robert J. Stein testified before the grand jury
Wednesday and said afterward that he still had not determined if
the baby's death was accidental or a homicide.
   Stein has said the baby died from lack of oxygen to the brain
because of the balloon and the termination of life-support.

   The Senate Finance Committee has asked for an
investigation into illegal imports of drug paraphernalia from
nations on the rim of the Pacific, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
said Thursday.
   He said the committee sent a letter to Anne Brunsdale,
chairwoman of the U.S. International Trade Commission, asking for
an investigation of the scope of illicit drug paraphernalia imports
and the effectiveness of the Mail Order Drug Control Act in
restricting such products.
   ``The proliferation of crack cocaine has spawned a new epidemic
in illegal paraphernalia imports,'' Moynihan said. ``Crack vials,
plastic bags and pipes are providing illegal profits often greater
than the drugs themselves.''
   He called for acting against the source countries, which include
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.
   Between April 15, 1988, and March 7, 1989, the Customs Service
seized at least $8 million worth of vials, pipes, spoons, straws,
filters, bags and other drug paraphernalia, the committee told
Brunsdale.

<HEAD>Reputed Leader of Medellin Cartel Sentenced in Absentia</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) _ Pablo Escobar Gaviria, said to
lead the notorious Medellin Cartel, was sentenced in absentia to 20
years in prison Thursday for conspiring to smuggle half a ton of
cocaine into this French Caribbean island.
   The Correctional Court of Pointe-a-Pitre also sentenced four
Colombians captured with the drug shipment in 1987 to prison terms
of 10 and 14 years.
   On Wednesday, the four identified Escobar during the trial as
the organizer of the shipment, which French police said was
destined for Europe.
   ``This is very significant because it's the first international
sentencing of Pablo Escobar by a court,'' said Jacques Floro, a
prosecutor.
   Juan Perez Piedraca, Howard Armando Castro Munoz, Jesus Garcia
Asparilla and David Ortiz Hernida were captured after their small
plane carrying the cocaine landed on Marie Galante, a small island
adjacent to Guadeloupe.
   ``It's the biggest drug bust in France and one of the biggest in
Europe,'' Floro said.
   Gustavo Gaviria and Gustavo Gonzalez of the drug cartel also
were identified as co-conspirators and sentenced in absentia to 20
years.
   Perez and Ortiz were given 14 years each and Garcia and Castro
10 years. Floro said French police valued the cocaine at $75
million and said it was 80 percent pure.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William Webster said Thursday
that Argentina is helping Algeria's nuclear development program and
has entered discussions on similar arrangements with Egypt, Iran
and Saudi Arabia.
   Argentina is emerging as an emerging nuclear supplier to the
developing Third World as more and more countries seek to develop
nuclear weapons capability, Webster said.
   He noted that none of Argentina's nuclear facilities are under
international safeguards to prevent proliferation.
   Webster cited Argentina as an example of the development of
nuclear capability outside the small group of nations that have
traditionally possessed it.
   In a hearing held on the 15th anniversary of the explosion of a
nuclear device by India, the CIA chief said evidence shows that
India is now ``interested in thermonuclear weapons capability,''
which would permit it to develop a hydrogen bomb.
   Webster said the nuclear rivalry between India and neighboring
Pakistan ``has all the earmarks of a race.''
   ``Yet no real efforts have been made in the international
community to head off that race,'' he said.
   Another witness before the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, Reginald Bartholomew, under secretary of State for
science and technology, said the Indian-Pakistani rivalry makes
South Asia of the greatest concern from a nuclear proliferation
standpoint.
   ``The immediate problem is to persuade both India and Pakistan
to observe restraint in their nuclear activities so that technical
developments do not overtake the chances for diplomatic progress,''
he said.
   Webster said that 15 or more nations, many from the developing
world, could possess nuclear weapons by the early years of the next
century.
   He also said many developing countries also are developing
ballistic missiles which could be used to carry nuclear or other
weapons to their targets.
   ``By the year 2000, at least 15 developing countries will be
producing their own ballistic missiles,'' he said.
   ``We believe the missile proliferation problem will affect every
region of the world,'' Webster said. ``It will become worse _ and
may never become better.''
   ``We cannot now tell you when or where these weapons may be
used,'' Webster said. ``The odds on use are growing as more
countries develop the technologies to settle old scores by new
means.''
   Webster said the CIA, aiming to obtain as much information as
possible about the growing number of countries edging toward
nuclear weapons capability, is focusing on those countries that
refuse to place nuclear facilities under safeguards or to sign the
nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
   The Soviet Union, a traditional supplier of short-range
ballistic missiles in the Third World, is now showing some interest
in at least discussing the possibility of reining in missile
proliferation, the CIA chief said.

   An American stuntman injured when a
helicopter crashed while filming a Chuck Norris movie died early
Thursday, bringing to five the number killed in the accident, U.S.
Air Force and production company officials said.
   Maj. Wayne Crist, spokesman at the U.S.-run Clark Air Base,
confirmed one of the injured had died in the base hospital but
refused to release the name. Crist referred reporters to Cannon
Entertainment, makers of the film ``Stranglehold: Delta Force II.''
   A Cannon spokeswoman identified the victim as Geoff Brewer,
about 30, of Los Angeles. She refused to give her name or further
details.
   The French-built Dauphin helicopter crashed Tuesday while
filming a scene from the movie near Tagaytay, 30 miles south of
Manila.
   The four other dead were identified as Don Marshall and Mike
Graham, both Americans; Gadi Danzig, an Israeli cameraman, and the
Filipino pilot, Jojo Imperial, officials said.
   Investigators said they had not determined the cause of the
accident but police said it may have been pilot error. A witness
said the tail of the 14-passenger, single-rotor helicopter struck a
wall and plunged out of control into a 40-foot ravine.
   The crash took place near an unfinished mansion commissioned by
former President Ferdinand Marcos which was being used as a set for
the film.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The army commander of a northern
port city ran over a teen-ager and killed him, and soldiers beat
the boy's grieving parents and a local reporter who covered the
incident, a radio station said Thursday.
   The Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soleil said Lt. Willy Ely,
army commander of the barracks in Gonaives, 110 miles north of the
capital, accidentally ran over 15-year-old Lubens Moise on
Wednesday night.
   Radio Soleil said that when the boy's parents screamed angrily
at Ely, soldiers who arrived on the scene beat them and several
bystanders with billy clubs before they dispersed.
   Soldiers using their rifle butts also beat Etiles Exinoel, a
reporter for Gonaives' Radio Trans Artibonite who came to cover the
incident, and confiscated his sound equipment, Radio Soleil said.
   A joint statement signed by several Gonaives radio reporters
protested ``the blind and brutal repression which has always
characterized the army in Gonaives in its dealings with an unarmed
population,'' Radio Soleil said.
   After the incident, soldiers shot repeatedly into the air to
keep residents inside, Radio Soleil said.

<HEAD>Scientist: Place Data From Holocaust Experiments Off Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARREN MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nazi experiments on concentration camp
prisoners were so unethical that scientists should ignore the
results, a professor from West Germany argued Thursday at an
international conference.
   ``One should not touch the scientific data from these people,''
Dr. Benno Muller-Hill of the University of Cologne's Institute of
Genetics told the conference on the meaning of the Holocaust for
bioethics.
   ``The notion of taboo is very, very important. To set up a taboo
is not a scientific decision. This is a value decision. I would
strongly advise setting up a taboo not to use any of this data,''
Muller-Hill said.
   While scientists should be asked their opinions on what should
be made taboo in research, Muller-Hill said ultimately the decision
should be made by the public.
   George Annas of Boston University School of Law and Public
Health, also on the panel at the University of Minnesota
conference, agreed that the data should not be used. He cautioned
about similarities between Nazi research and research now being
conducted in the United States without prior consideration of
ethical arguments.
   ``The only time we take medical ethics seriously in the United
States is when it doesn't matter, when the scientists can do their
research anyway,'' Annas maintained. ``The main view in science is
to do the research first and worry about the ethics later.''
   Annas predicted that within a decade scientists will have the
capability of testing an embryo and determining all of its genetic
defects as people decide whether to continue pregnancies.
   Not only will tests be able to determine what diseases a person
will be born with, but also what diseases a person may develop
later in life, he said.
   ``Once we're able to do genetic manipulation at the embryo
level, we'll literally be able to manufacture the children we
want,'' Annas said.
   Such capabilities must not be pursued in an ethical vacuum, he
stressed.
   ``I'd like to suggest that America's last frontier is morality,
ethics. We have to decide what direction we're going. Our goal
seems to be an antiseptic world in which we'll all live to be
100,'' Annas said.
   ``We are tarred by the Nazis. We can't get out of it until we
confront it. That really is our challenge,'' he added. ``I hope
this conference will provide impetus to some scientists to take
values seriously.''
   But Richard King, a professor with the University of Minnesota's
Institute of Human Genetics, drew a distinction between Nazi
research and what is being done in the United States.
   ``Many of the processes that went on in Germany are similar to
what we consider ethical medical practice in the United States,''
King said. ``The major difference is that all of the genetic
community deals with genetics from an individual standpoint. We try
to use our information to educate individuals so they can make
decisions. We do not deal with genetics on a population scale.''
   King said he believes current research should include a very
strong ethical component but not that ethical decisions should be
made before the research is done.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Minnesota Center
for Biomedical Ethics, said Wednesday that renowned scientists
enabled the Third Reich to exterminate millions of people in World
War II by helping develop gas chambers and by propounding racist
theories.
   Scientists, he said, ``were not dragged kicking and screaming
and protesting'' into Nazism.

   House Speaker Jim Wright struggled Thursday to
halt an erosion of political support stemming from ethics
allegations, as even his supporters talked about finding a
dignified way to ease him from his post.
   ``It's time for a leadership change,'' said Indiana Rep. Phil
Sharp, becoming one of a handful of Democrats to say aloud what
others have said privately.
   ``It's getting to the time where we need stronger and more
focused leadership on legislation, and it's become obvious that the
speaker is so occupied with this thing that he can't devote his
undivided attention to the leadership of the House,'' Sharp said
late Wednesday after a meeting of Indiana Democratic House members.
   Wright pinned his hopes on a televised public hearing next week,
gambling that it would give his lawyers a chance to eliminate the
major charges against him.
   ``I think we're going to be successful in these motions. I have
every confidence,'' Wright said, making a brief appearance before
television cameras to pronounce himself ``delighted'' that the
House ethics committee had scheduled a hearing for Tuesday.
   Wright's supporters agreed that the motions may be make-or-break
time for the Texas Democrat, who is charged with 69 violations of
House rules. But others in the Democratic caucus were saying openly
that regardless of any legal rulings, Wright's political battle
already is lost.
   ``We're getting down to the short rows now,'' said Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, one of the speaker's staunch supporters. ``It's
got to quit raining on the speaker. The next things that happen
will be significant, and the speaker has to win them.''
   A group of moderate Democrats who have been supportive of Wright
also were talking privately about how badly the speaker's political
standing has slipped.
   More than a dozen in the group met late Wednesday to discuss the
speaker's defense, but wound up talking about whether it was time
for the party to help Wright find ``a graceful, dignified way
out,'' according to one participant, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   That might include letting the ethics process run its course so
that the speaker could win at least partial exoneration on legal
grounds, sources said.
   While that feeling was not universally shared by those at the
meeting, there was a broader consensus that Wright has not been
getting realistic political advice from the inner circle of Texas
supporters who have clustered about him, sources said.
   The group discussed how to broaden the political assessments
reaching Wright so that they more accurately reflect the feelings
of all House Democrats.
   The ethics committee, after a 2{-hour meeting, announced that it
would hold a six-hour televised hearing on Tuesday to let Wright's
lawyers argue why the panel should drop the most serious charges
against the speaker: that he evaded limits on outside income
through bulk sales of his book, and that he accepted $145,000 in
gifts from a business partner with a direct interest in legislation.
   ``We welcome the opportunity for our case _ and we believe it is
very, very strong _ to be heard before the public,'' Wright said.
   Wright himself will not appear at the hearing, but his legal
team will argue that the ethics committee has stretched House rules
in charging their client with wrongdoing.
   Ethics committee special outside counsel Richard J. Phelan will
argue the committee's position, and the ethics panel could rule on
the issue sometime next week. ``Phelan's position is very well
founded,'' said committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif.
   One of Wright's eight lawyers, William Oldaker, conceded that
motions to dismiss charges routinely are denied and put chances of
success at no better than 50-50.
   The ethics panel also voted to release to Wright's lawyers three
documents on which their rules interpretations are partially based.
But it denied the speaker access to advisory opinions on ethical
questions which the panel has given other House members, saying
that to release them would violate confidentiality the members
receiving the opinions expect.
   The committee also continued to take depositions in an effort to
wrap up its investigation of Wright, hearing Thursday from Tom Law,
a Fort Worth attorney who administers the speaker's blind trust.
   The panel is exploring a gas drilling venture which netted
Wright a quick $170,000 profit last year at a time when he needed
$100,000 to pay off a bank loan from a failed nursing home
investment.
   Wright said he had not been contacted in connection with a
reported Internal Revenue Service preliminary criminal
investigation of his business dealings with Fort Worth developer
George Mallick.
   ``I cannot imagine that there would be any question on the mind
of the IRS,'' he said. And Law, who manages the blind trust, said
``I've not heard of that at all'' when asked about the IRS probe.
   Late Thursday, Wright's office issued a statement saying that
Gary Booth, Dallas district director of the IRS, had denied to the
speaker's lawyer that any investigation was being conducted. An IRS
spokeswoman, citing legal restrictions, said she could not confirm
or deny whether Booth had made such a statement.
   But the new charge, along with continuing questions about
Wright's investment in the nursing home venture, Jewell
Enterprises, clearly worried Democrats.
   ``The constant addition of problems has not been helpful,''
Stenholm said. ``Some things have got to break extremely favorably
for the speaker.''

   The Supreme Court on Thursday denied a stay of
execution for Henry Willis III, convicted of murdering a small-town
Georgia police chief who was shot to death one day before he was to
quit law enforcement.
   The application for the stay was filed at 6:40 p.m. and the
denial issued at 7:11 p.m., said court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented,
Arberg said.
   At 6:30 p.m., 30 minutes before Willis' scheduled 7 p.m.
execution, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta had granted a four-hour stay for Willis to give
his attorneys time to file an appeal with the Supreme Court.
   Before the ruling, Willis' attorney, Millard Farmer, was turned
down in three different courtrooms. Within hours Thursday, a
Georgia Superior Court judge and the state Supreme Court denied a
stay. Later, the state Board of Pardons and Paroles refused
clemency.
   Willis' attorney, Millard Farmer, then filed an appeal with U.S.
District Judge Wilbur Owens in Macon, but Owens denied it, agreeing
with the parole board that Willis ``failed to make a substantial
showing that he has been denied a federal right'' in his trial.
   Willis, 36, was scheduled to die for the 1976 slaying of Police
Chief Ed Giddens of Ray City.

   Garrison Keillor, whose ``Prairie Home
Companion'' stories about mythical Lake Wobegon warmed radio
audiences for 13 years, said Thursday he's returning to the U.S.
airwaves after a two-year absence.
   His ``American Radio Company of the Air,'' to be produced by
Minnesota Public Radio, will feature sketches, monologues and a
variety of American music.
   Lake Wobegon will be back in the new show, Keillor said at a
news conference Thursday. But he warned that the ``town that time
forgot'' has undergone changes.
   ``Times have been hard back there, as they have been all across
the Midwest,'' Keillor said. ``It's hard to make them into humor.''
   The program will be performed before theater audiences in New
York, St. Paul, Minn., and other cities in a 12-show series to be
broadcast live on Saturday nights starting Sept. 30.
   Keillor, who is in San Francisco for a public radio conference,
said the show will have the music of Fats Waller, Aaron Copland,
Leonard Bernstein, hymns and ``all the great things that every
American ought to hear at least twice.''
   The folksy humorist and best-selling author stunned fans two
years ago when he called an end to his American Public Radio
program with an estimated 4 to 5 million listeners in order to
``resume the life of a shy person.''
   Despite estimates of a huge audience, Keillor calculated he has
about 13,000 true fans while others ``talk about buttermilk
biscuits and the `Home on the Prairie Show.'''
   When he abandoned Sheila the Christian Jungle Girl, Norwegian
bachelor farmers and other inhabitants of his mythical hometown,
Lake Wobegon, he said he wanted to flee the frustrations of fame,
including nosy reporters.
   Standing on stage with his hands plunged in the pockets of a
gray plaid suit and slowing chewing gum, Keillor generated guffaws
when he asked his audience for ``one more question, and make it
irritable.''
   After his last ``Prairie Home Companion'' broadcast in June
1987, Keillor bid farewell to Minnesota for his wife's native
Denmark. He returned after he found it hard to work there because
he didn't pick up the language quickly.
   ``I suppose that was kind of embarrassing, too, to have failed
so publicly, to have planted your flag so publicly and having to
pull it out,'' he said.
   Keillor, 46, now calls Minnesota home again, but also has
apartments in New York City and Copenhagen.
   ``Home is a spiritual place,'' he said Thursday, ``and in some
ways I feel closer to Minnesota and Lake Wobegone'' living in New
York and Copenhagen.
   ``New York is not a nurturing place. It's an abrasive place, but
you need to have a little skin rubbed off'' or your sense of humor
turns sentimental, Keillor said.
   His first book, ``Lake Wobegon Days,'' was about his fictional
hometown. His next was ``Leaving Home.'' His most recent is ``We
Are Still Married,'' a compilation of letters, poems and stories
written during the Reagan years.

   Congress failed to find a way Thursday
immediately to provide needed cash for this year's veterans
programs, while the Senate finished unusually early congressional
action on the $1.17 trillion federal budget for 1990.
   The Senate approved next year's budget on a 63-37 vote,
following House approval by a day. It was the earliest completion
date for an overall spending plan in 11 years.
   The House ended weeks of partisan stalemate by approving $1.2
billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, enough to replenish
the agency's dwindling coffers through the Sept. 30 end of this
fiscal year. But the Senate provided only enough to keep the
agency's programs running until June 15, estimated to be about $75
million.
   Both chambers acted on voice votes.
   The two houses of Congress must agree to identical legislation
before sending it to the White House for the president's signature.
Thus, the discrepancy meant that final legislative action was not
possible until the House returns to work next week.
   By providing only a piece of the veterans' money, the Senate
left itself with a vehicle _ future legislation containing the rest
of the veterans' funds _ that might contain dollars for other
programs favored by senators.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
said there are ``many, many programs'' that need extra money. He
cited $6.6 million he would like for a program that gives subsidies
to air carriers who serve remote communities.
   The veterans' money had been contained in a multi-billion
measure that had been bogged down because of fights over $822
million it carried for anti-drug programs.
   Democrats said the drug spending was needed because law
enforcement agencies across the country were running out of money,
but Republicans said the authorities already had more money than
they could handle. The Bush administration had threatened to veto
the bill because of the anti-drug funds.
   After hours of huddles among party leaders, the veterans'
spending was pushed ahead alone. The House will resume its
wrangling over the remaining $2.5 billion for anti-drug efforts,
the costs of fighting last year's forest fires, and other programs
next week.
   ``We do realize other things are controversial,'' said House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., in
explaining the decision to let the veterans' part proceed by itself.
   The bill contains money for this year for medical care,
compensation payments, and other benefits for veterans. With
Congress' Memorial Day recess coming up in several days, lawmakers
admittedly dreaded the prospect of delivering speeches to veterans'
groups with the money still stalled.
   ``How can we go back and talk to our veterans ... if we are not
able to deal with the business of this House,'' asked Rep.
Frederick Upton, R-Mich.
   While action on the veterans bill was slowed by political
fencing, work on the federal budget was predictably harmonious.
   The huge spending plan _ for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
_ merely fleshed out a deficit reduction deal that President Bush
and congressional leaders had reached April 14.
   That pact worked out usually prickly questions about deficit
reduction and spending levels, decisions that normally lead to
months of delay and maneuvering. Until now, 1978 was the last time
work on the budget outline was completed this early in the year.
   The House approved the package by a 241-185 vote on Wednesday.
   In both chambers, support for the spending plan was broad but
unenthusiastic.
   The budget claims to reduce the federal shortfall by $28 billion
to $99.7 billion, but even supporters admitted that the measure
does little to ease the government's long-term deficit problem. It
relies on economc projections that most economists consider overly
optimistic, thereby making the deficit look smaller. It also claims
$850 million in savings by moving payments to farmers from next
year to this year, and it includes one-time cash infusions such as
asset sales.
   ``Taking more decisive action is not an option,'' said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``In my judgment,
it's a necessity.''
   The package would hold defense spending to $299.2 billion next
year, $4.6 billion short of the amount needed to match inflation.
   Domestic programs, overall, would get about $4 billion more than
needed to keep pace with cost-of-living increases. Law enforcement,
education, space and low-income assistance programs were given
healthy increases, although transportation, environment and
agriculture initiatives were treated more harshly.
   Foreign aid programs would get $16.7 billion, enough to keep up
with inflation.
   Congress would still have to raise taxes by $5.3 billion and
agree to limit growth in Medicare spending by $2.3 billion, sell
$5.7 billion worth of assets, and raise federal fees by $2.7
billion. Agreeing to specifics could be contentious.
   Other savings would come from $1.1 billion worth of changes in
federal pension programs. The government would raise $496 million
by changing the way the Department of Veterans Affairs sells
housing loan portfolios, and $1.8 billion by moving the
money-losing Postal Service off-budget.
   Recipients of Social Security and other federal income support
programs would receive their full annual cost-of-living increases.
Civilian and military government employees would be entitled to a
3.6 percent pay increase.
   Some $181 billion would be spent to pay interest on the federal
debt, which is expected to reach $2.8 trillion this summer.
   The budget does not need the president's signature. It is used
by Congress as a blueprint when it passes its later spending and
taxing bills.

<HEAD>Mexican Navy Fires On, Boards U.S. Fishing Vessel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mexican naval vessel fired on and boarded a
U.S. fishing boat Thursday morning in the Gulf of Mexico after
accusing it of fishing in Mexican waters, the Coast Guard said.
   None of the boat's three crew members was injured but several
bullets struck the fishing boat H.W. Junior when the Mexican patrol
used gunfire to stop the vessel, said Coast Guard spokesman Capt.
Randy Peterson.
   After Mexican authorities boarded the boat, the Mexican vessel
left the area and the Coast Guard ships escorted the H.W. Junior
into Port Isabel, Texas, according to a Coast Guard statement.
   ``The indication is that Mexican authorities were correct in
their action,'' said Capt. Randy Peterson, a Coast Guard public
affairs officer in Washington. He said international law allows
police action against vessels outside territorial waters if
authorities are in ``hot pursuit.''
   The Coast Guard release said the H.W. Junior was 15 miles
east-northeast of Port Isabel when Mexican authorities shot at and
boarded the vessel.
   Meanwhile, Mexican authorities announced in Mexico City that
they intercepted an American fishing vessel called the Juanita and
arrested its three-member crew, described as two persons of
Nicaraguan origin and one of Cuban origin. Authorities said the
three were turned over to ``competent authorities'' in the port of
Tampico where it said the vessel was taken.
   The Mexican report did not say when that incident occurred, and
it was not immediately clear whether it referred to a separate
incident. A Coast Guard duty officer in New Orleans, Steve Guy,
said he knew of no report involving a vessel called Juanita.
   Coast Guard public affairs officer Lt. Pat Philbin in New
Orleans said a Coast Guard jet and two ships were sent and
witnessed the boarding after the fishing boat called for assistance.
   ``The incident was apparently sparked over Mexican claims that
the shrimper was in Mexican territorial waters,'' said a Coast
Guard statement.
   Philbin said no action was taken against the boat by U.S.
authorities, aside from a warning issued in port because it did not
have a device to exclude turtles from its fishing nets.
   He said the names of the boat's crew members were not
immediately available. The H.W. Junior's home port is Brownsville,
Texas.
   Philbin said U.S. authorities could not verify whether the boat
was fishing in Mexican waters because they did not observe it prior
to the boarding.
   Mexican authorities said the boat was caught fishing about six
miles off the Mexico shore, five miles south of the border between
Mexican and U.S. waters, Philbin said.
   State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck, asked if the Mexican
government had been contacted about the incident, said she had no
other details.

   Former publisher Walter Annenberg's
collection of impressionist art, including what one expert called a
``smack-in-the-kisser Renoir'' and ``the'' Monet, goes on display
publicly this weekend for the first time.
   The former ambassador's collection of 50 noted impressionist and
post-impressionist paintings includes works by Paul Cezanne, Claude
Monet, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. They will be shown in the
special exhibit beginning Sunday at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
   ``You're dealing with three generations of very revolutionary
painters who were leaning on each other very hard and then reacted
very hard,'' said Joe Rishel, the museum's curator of pre-1900
European paintings.
   Annenberg and his wife, Leonore, accumulated the collection over
three decades. It is accompanied by two Cezanne sketchbooks
Annenberg gave to the museum in 1987, and offers a concentration of
leading impressionist and post-impressionist works ``that's hard to
come by anywhere in the world publicly,'' Rishel said.
   ``What the Annenbergs have achieved, truly remarkably, is it's
not just the good Monet; it is `the' Monet. It's not just the
(good) Renoir; it is the right there, smack-in-the-kisser Renoir,''
Rishel said.
   ``They've had the discipline to wait for the very best to come,
then to act.''
   Standing before Gauguin's 1890s ``The Siesta,'' a colorful oil
painting of four women in the shade on a porch with a sun-drenched
lawn beyond, Rishel said, ``If you want a Tahitian Gauguin, you
want this Gauguin. It has everything, that dazzling light of the
tropics.''
   Placement of the paintings emphasizes contrasting styles of the
artists, but shows similarities and examples of borrowed ideas.
   In one room hangs Cezanne's imposing ``Portrait of Uncle
Dominique as a Monk,'' an 1866 painting showing a stern
black-bearded figure in a white hooded robe against an olive gray
backdrop.
   At the opposite end of the wall is ``Seated Peasant,'' a Cezanne
work painted about 30 years later in softer dark hues, a serious
but less imposing figure with his arms folded in his lap.
   The paintings, on loan, had been in the Annenberg's Rancho
Mirage, Calif., home. The exhibition is set to run through Sept. 17.
   Annenberg founded Triangle Publications, which included TV
Guide, Good Food and Seventeen magazine and The Racing Form when it
was sold last year.
   Annenberg was appointed ambassador to England during the Nixon
administration and in 1981, Mrs. Annenberg was appointed chief of
protocol by then-President Reagan.

<HEAD>Many Pregnant Women May Unwittingly Risk Infecting Child With Herpes,
Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quarter or more of pregnant women may
unknowingly be infected with the genital herpes virus, putting
their child at risk, a researcher said Thursday.
   Pregnant women should tell their obstetricians and pediatricians
about even apparently minor signs that could signal a silent herpes
infection, said Yvonne Bryson.
   Infants born to infected women can become infected during the
birth process, and the child's infection can cause death or mental
retardation if left untreated. But doctors can prevent transmission
by delivering the child through Caesarean section, or if a child
does become infected, early treatment can minimize the consequences.
   Bryson, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University
of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine, spoke at a
symposium on sexually transmitted diseases. It was sponsored by the
American Medical Association and the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
   In an interview, Bryson said she and UCLA colleague Lisa Frenkel
studied 1,000 pregnant women who had no reported history of genital
herpes. Using a blood test not available outside of research
studies, they found evidence that about 25 percent of the women
were infected with the genital herpes virus.
   A study of low-income black women in Atlanta found an infection
rate of about 65 percent, but not all of those women were
necessarily free of prior signs of infection, Bryson said.
   The risk that an unwittingly infected women will pass the virus
to her child is low, but women without a known history of herpes
should still be looking for signs that they may be infected, Bryson
said.
   The signs, which occur in the genital area, include blisters,
sores, bumps and itchy spots, she said.
   She also said tests to screen pregnant women for herpes
infection should be developed commercially, allowing for widespread
testing.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally in Armenia to Demand Freedom for Jailed Activists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Armenians demonstrated for the
freedom of jailed activists and action by the legislature on their
demands to annex a region in neighboring Azerbaijan, a local
journalist said Thursday.
   About 40,000 people in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, took
part in the two-hour protest Wednesday in front of the Matenadaran,
a world-famous library of ancient manuscripts, said Rem Ananikan,
deputy director of the official Armenpress news agency.
   The demonstration was illegal under military regulations imposed
to restore order in Yerevan, but no arrests were reported, Ananikan
said.
   Speaking in a telephone interview from Yerevan, Ananikan said
police initially tried to break up the protest but ultimately let
it go on.
   The protesters were calling for the release of 14 jailed members
of the Karabkah Committee, which last year launched a campaign for
Armenia to annex the Nagorno-Karabakh region, where three-quarters
of the 162,000 inhabitants are ethnic Armenians. Nagorno-Karabakh
is part of the republic of Azerbaijan.
   The Kremlin rejected the unification demand, putting
Nagorno-Karabakh under Moscow's direct control instead and jailing
the committee members.
   Ananikan said demonstrators also called for an emergency meeting
of Armenia's Supreme Soviet legislature to resolve the Karabakh
issue before a new national parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies, convenes in Moscow on May 25.
   ``They want the leadership of our republic to get involved once
again in the Karabakh question,'' the Armenpress official said. He
said the protesters demanded the unification of Karabakh with
Armenia or its complete withdrawal from Azerbaijan.
   The Armenian drive to annex Nagorno-Karabakh, launched in
February 1988, led to ethnic strife between predominantly Christian
Armenians and mostly Moslem Azerbaijanis in which more than 90
people were killed last year.
   After four months of relative calm, unrest broke out again in
Nagorno-Karabakh early this month as Armenians accused Soviet
authorities of trying to increase the number of Azerbaijanis in the
district through a crash building program. A general strike
declared May 3 by Armenians in the district was continuing,
Ananikan said.

   NASA on Thursday said many of the bolts
holding together space shuttle Discovery's booster rockets during
its August launch will be defective but will pose no danger to the
flight.
   The rockets on Atlantis earlier this month also may have
contained weakened bolts, and the same may have been true for
Challenger, which exploded on takeoff in 1986, said William D.
Hager, assistant inspector general for NASA.
   ``We have no reason to believe they have not been on all
boosters,'' he said at a news conference here.
   He added, however, that there was no evidence that substandard
or defective bolts had endangered any flights or compromised any
mission.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials decided
to continue using bolts from companies under investigation because
the fasteners were in non-crucial areas or had backups to ensure
safety, Hager said.
   The comments came as Hager and U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman
announced that Lee Aerospace Products Inc. of Chatsworth, Calif.,
had been indicted on charges of lying about the manufacture and
testing of steel fasteners used by the space agency.
   Hager said it would cost nearly $11 million to test and remove
all Lee Aerospace bolts suspected of being deficient, but he did
not know whether this would be done.
   The company has not been suspended or barred from doing business
with government contractors, Hager said.
   A grand jury indicted Lee Aerospace President Darrell Lee and
Vice President Jerry Martin on fraud charges carrying up to 170
years in prison and fines of $8.5 million. The company faces a
maximum fine of $17 million if convicted.
   Two other Los Angeles-area aerospace firms, A.O. Sammons and
Lawrence Engineering Co., have been charged in similar cases.
   Sammons pleaded guilty to 43 counts of fraudulent certification
of bolts. The case against Lawrence Engineering has not come to
trial, NASA said.

<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms battered Louisiana and southeastern Texas
on Thursday, producing tornadoes, damaging wind and very heavy rain
for a second day in a row, and thunderstorms also developed over
the Plains.
   From 5 to 14 inches of rain fell in 24 hours over southeastern
Texas and western Louisiana. Coushatta, La., reported 14.20 inches
in 24 hours.
   Flooding closed some 40 major roads in Louisiana, State Police
said.
   Two train engines and 15 rail cars derailed during the night
when they hit flooded tracks in northwestern Louisiana's Red River
Parish, authorities said Thursday.
   A tornado was reported near Rayne, La., in Acadia Parish shortly
before noon and another was spotted northeast of Lafayette, La.,
after noon, authorities. There were no immediate reports of
injuries.
   A tornado also was reported briefly on the ground near downtown
Houston, Texas.
   On Wednesday, a tornado killed a woman and four people drowned
in swollen creeks in Texas. Flooding forced hundreds of Dallas-Fort
Worth area residents to leave their homes. A levee failed along the
Trinity River in Dallas and rising tributaries forced more
evacuations Thursday.
   In Lake Charles, La., the roof of a building housing a Masonic
lodge and a furniture store collapsed early Thursday under the
weight of collected rain water, said Civil Defense director Jerry
Merchant. There were no injuries.
   Wind damage was reported elsewhere in Louisiana with power lines
down and trees blown onto at least two mobile homes, the National
Weather Service said.
   Heavier rain during the six hours up to 1 p.m. CDT included 5.11
inches at Houston's airport; 3.23 inches at Beaumont-Port Arthur,
Texas; and 2.50 inches at Lake Charles, La.
   Another area of severe thunderstorms developed across eastern
Kansas and eastern Oklahoma. Tornadoes were reported in Kansas near
Sylvia and Clay Center and in northeastern Oklahoma's Wagoner and
Rogers counties, the weather service said.
   Two houses and two mobile homes were damaged by the Oklahoma
twisters and one person was injured, authorities said.
   Gerald Gouard, Rogers County, Okla., commissioner, said
relatives who gathered at his house before a funeral saw one
tornado develop. The tornado came to the edge of his yard, but rose
up over the house and a shop before hitting another house.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell west of Valley Falls, Kan., and
hail an inch in diameter fell elsewhere in Kansas at Basehor,
Linwood and Kansas City.
   Overbrook, Kan., got half an inch of rain in 10 minutes.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered over the northern Pacific Coast,
as well as from south-central Nebraska into northern Illinois. A
snow advisory was posted for the Cascades of Oregon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 97 at Beeville, Texas. Thursday's low
for the 48 contiguous states was 23 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Friday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the
central and eastern Gulf Coast region across much of the
Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio Valley into the upper Great Lakes.
Showers and some thunderstorms were expected over the northern
Plains. Showers were forecast across the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 50s and 60s were predicted from the northern and
central Pacific Coast to the upper Missouri Valley; in the 60s
across northeastern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin; in the 90s
across much of Texas, the southern Rockies, the desert Southwest
and the central and southern Florida Peninsula; and generally in
the 70s or 80s in the remainder of the nation.

   Shops and banks were closed Thursday
and labor activists roamed the streets to enforce a 12-hour general
strike, but President Carlos Andres Perez pledged to keep a
government austerity plan that prompted the protest.
   The strike was the first in 31 years of democracy in Venezuela.
The strike organizer, the Venezuela Confederation of Workers,
claimed it paralyzed the nation.
   But Perez, in a nationally televised news conference held five
minutes after the strike ended at 6 p.m., said the government would
continue with the austerity plan ``because it is the only way open
to us.''
   The president said he sympathized with the working classes, hit
by severe increases in bus fares, gasoline and other consumer
items, but he stressed that any reversal would mean a ``catastrophe
for Venezuela.''
   In downtown Caracas, strike supporters surrounded a McDonald's
restaurant, breaking windows and forcing the restaurant to close.
   ``Close it down! Down with the gringos!'' shouted about 200
members of the Venezuelan Worker's Federation, ``dissuasive
brigades'' dispatched to roam the streets and enforce the work
stoppage.
   ``Up with McDonald's! This is a free country!'' customers
shouted back.
   Fistfights broke out between union members and store managers.
Soldiers were sent in to cordon off the store.
   The labor force also forced the closing of several banks that
defied the strike call.
   The 3 million-member labor federation called the strike to
protest the austerity measures, which prompted riots in February
and left at least 276 people dead.
   The unrest broke out after Perez cut government subsidies for a
broad range of consumer items and public services as part of an
effort to ease payments on the nation's $33 billion foreign debt.
   Many people blamed labor unions, which are closely tied to the
governing Democratic Action Party, for not doing enough to defend
working-class people affected by the measures. In response, the
union called for the strike.
   The government declared the strike illegal but said it would
``avoid useless confrontations that in no way benefit the nation.''
   Squadrons of motorcycle police cruised the streets, which were
empty as most Venezuelans stayed home.
   Labor leaders said the strike closed the nation's small and
medium industries, shops, banks and public services, and paralyzed
transportation.
   All international flights were canceled from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
travel agents said.
   Basic industries such as oil and aluminum operated normally
under a pact worked out between the government-run enterprises and
unions affiliated with the confederation.
   Venezuela depends on oil exports for 90 percent of its export
revenue.
   Planning Minister Miguel Rodriguez said the strike would cost
the country $300 million in lost productivity.

   Former Sen. George S. McGovern says he was
haunted for 40 years by the fear _ which proved unfounded _ that he
had killed an innocent Austrian farm family when he jettisoned a
loose explosive from the Army bomber he was piloting near the end
of World War II.
   McGovern, the liberal, antiwar Democratic candidate from South
Dakota who was soundly defeated by President Nixon in the 1972
election, recalled the troubling wartime incident in a lecture
Thursday night at the National Air and Space Museum.
   McGovern flew 35 combat missions against Nazi German industrial
targets as pilot of the ``Dakota Queen,'' a B-24 Liberator bomber
with the Army's 15th Air Force based in Cerignola, Italy.
   Returning to his home base from a bombing run over Austria on
March 14, 1945, McGovern said, his crew reported that the plane
still carried a live bomb which had caught in its rack and was
dangling from the bomb bay.
   The crew finally succeeded in dislodging the bomb before the
plane landed, McGovern said.
   ``We saw it fall and hit in the middle of a farmyard just as the
clock showed 12 noon,'' he said. ``The house, barn and other
buildings flew in all directions. I envisioned a young farm family
sitting down for their noon meal blown to pieces.
   ``When I landed back at our base in Italy, I was handed a cable
saying that Eleanor had given birth to our first child, our
daughter Ann. The thought went through my mind that we had brought
a child into the world and that same day I had killed someone
else's children,'' he said.
   In 1985, while he was a guest professor at the University of
Innsbruck in Austria, McGovern said he recalled the incident ``that
still continued to haunt me many years later'' during a taped
interview for an Austrian television documentary about World War II.
   After the interview was broadcast, he said, ``an elderly
Austrian farmer telephoned the TV station and said that the
farmhouse I had described bombing was his.
   ``He saw the bomb coming and sought safety. No one was hurt. `We
hated Adolf Hitler,' he said, `and if bombing our farmhouse helped
in any way to bring him down, tell Sen. McGovern we are grateful.'
   ``So after 40 years, I was exonerated from the incident that had
bothered me since World War II,'' McGovern said.
   Earlier in the war, McGovern's plane lost two of its four
engines during a raid on the Skoda ammunition works at Pilsen,
Czechoslovakia, in December 1944.
   The 22-year-old pilot nursed the crippled plane to a safe
emergency landing, despite flames in a third engine, on a short
runway on an island in the Adriatic Sea. That feat earned McGovern
the Distinguished Flying Cross.
   McGovern, 66, is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a
liberal Washington think tank, and lectures frequently on college
campuses on foreign policy and domestic issues. The annual Charles
A. Lindbergh Memorial Lecture, which he delivered Thursday,
celebrates the aviation pioneer's historic solo flight across the
Atlantic on May 20-21, 1927.
   McGovern said he proudly supported the U.S. war effort against
Germany and Japan but opposed American involvement in the Vietnam
War, which he called ``the most costly single blunder in our
national history'' and ``a war we did not deserve to win.''
   McGovern said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
initiatives ``may enable us to end the cold war and reverse the
arms race.'' He said he hoped the Bush administration ``will have
the wisdom, imagination and courage to seize on these new
opportunities to build our nation and our international role around
the new conditions of peace.''

   The justice minister said
Thursday that President Jose Napoleon Duarte has reversed a
decision to allow 109 wounded rebels to leave the country under
pressure from the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   Justice Minister Julio Samayoa made the comments at an informal
news conference Thursday. He told reporters another factor in
Duarte's decision was this week's attack on the San Salvador home
of Ricardo Alvarenga Valdivieso, speaker of the legislature.
   Gunmen on Tuesday sprayed Alvarenga's home with submachine gun
fire, killing a police guard outside.
   Alvarenga and other leaders of the rightist alliance, known as
Arena, blamed leftist rebels for the attack. The rebel Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front denied the charge, calling it a
maneuver by Arena to lay the blame on the guerrillas and force
Duarte to suspend the evacuation of the wounded.
   On Tuesday, Duarte told reporters he had given orders for the
wounded to be allowed to leave the country.
   According to church reports, seven of the 109 wounded are blind,
41 are amputees, four are paraplegics and seven have lost one eye.
Church workers said they should be allowed to leave the country for
humanitarian reasons and seek further medical treatment abroad.
   Soon after taking office in 1984, Duarte set up the wounded
rebel transfer program that works with church groups and the
international Red Cross. Duarte has said the program was created
for humanitarian reasons and in accord with the Geneva Convention.
   The program has permitted 346 wounded rebels to leave El
Salvador. The majority receive medical help in Cuba and Mexico.
   The program allows injured rebels to seek proper medical care
without having to worry about being captured. Medical care in rebel
jungle camps is often lacking and rebels who seek medical health in
city hospitals are subject to arrest.
   Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
San Salvador, told reporters that the evacuation had been suspended
but not indefitintely.
   Rivera Damas has been acting as an intermediary between the
government and the rebels.
   ``The blocking of the evacuation of the injured rebels can be
blamed on the increase of guerrilla actions,'' the archbishop said.
   Duarte's centrist Christian Democrats lost the March 19
elections to Alfredo Cristiani of Arena. The rightist party has
claimed Salvadoran law bars people involved in acts of terrorism or
accused of criminal actions from leaving the country.
   Cristiani is scheduled to be sworn in as president on June 1 for
a five-year term.
   Human rights groups, including the church, estimate that more
than 65,000 people have lost their lives since the civil war began
in 1979.

<TEXT>
   ``Laughing Matters'' is the title of an
off-Broadway evening of sketches written and performed by the
comedy duo of Linda Wallem and Peter Tolan. While a viewer doesn't
fall apart in helpless bellylaughs, one really does laugh _ a lot.
   The title of the evening which opened Thursday at the Theater at
St. Peter's Church correctly indicates that it's focusing on
situations which are funny.
   In the first mini-play, a couple meet on a blind date in a
restaurant. The man, a nerd who pronounces pate as if it were the
crown of his head, mentally is moving the relationship on
fast-forward and is terribly concerned about AIDS. At a perfect
moment for get-acquainted small talk, he blurts, ``Can I have a
throat culture?''
   In the next vignette, Tolan is a fast-talking, money and
telephone-addicted agent visited by a 15-year-old recording star
who doesn't like being different from other girls. In a rather
sweet ending, she feels a lot better when Mr. High Pressure relaxes
long enough to tell her she only has a few more months of stardom.
   Other skits satirize overconcern with age and what morality in
government means in Washington D.C. Act 2 begins with Tolan playing
piano for three songs he wrote, sung by both of them. One,
sprinkled with Yiddish words, comments on how Catholics and
Protestants who move to New York become a little Jewish. It was
greeted with laughs of recognition.
   Both halves of the evening end with a couple in Champaign, Ill.
To say that their taste and sophistication is on the backwoodsy
level is probably placing that a notch too high. Yelling
conflicting commands at their children is their child-rearing style
and when once they yell the same thing, Miss Wallem says
wonderingly, ``That doesn't happen very often.''
   Martin Charnin, who wrote lyrics for and directed ``Annie,''
directed, keeping the evening moving crisply. Zev Guber, Sanford H.
Fisher and Beluga Entertainment Corp. produced.
   Miss Wallem was born in Madison, Wis., grew up in Rockford,
Ill., and attended the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
Tolan is from Scituate, Mass., and attended the University of
Massachusetts in Amherst.
   Their sketches have variety and humor and though people may yell
angrily, anger and satire never cut deep.
   Amplified ``backstage'' converstions between skits doesn't add
much for the audience but gives the pair time to change clothes.

   Football star Dexter Manley told a Senate
panel Thursday that he has finally overcome childhood rejection and
gained self-respect since seeking help three years agoto learn to
read and write.
   Manley, a defensive end for the Washington Redskins, graduated
from Houston schools and completed all but 45 hours of
undergraduate work at Oklahoma State University despite a severe
learning disability that effectively rendered him illiterate.
   He enrolled in night classes at Washington's Lab School three
years ago after seeing teammate Joe Theismann felled by a broken
leg during a game against the New York Giants.
   ``I can recall that vividly,'' Manley told Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., chairman of the Senate education subcommittee. ``I had so
much fear and insecurity. I was saying, I hope to God this never
happens to me because what would I do.''
   Manley, 30, was judged to have a second-grade reading level when
he entered the Lab School. He was diagnosed as having an auditory
channel problem that makes it difficult for him to remember what he
hears, particularly rote material like the sounds that letters make.
   ``Somehow or another, you have to find the will ... to come
forward and ask for help. That's the most difficult thing for a
human being to do,'' Manley said of his decision at 27 to face his
problem. ``I had to humble myself. I had to walk into the Lab
School and not pretend. Today I can read and write. I have some
self-respect.''
   Manley brought with him a written statement, but with all eyes
on him in a hearing room packed with spectators and television
cameras, he began to stumble from the first sentence. Sweat rolled
down his cheeks and tears of frustration filled his eyes by the
time he had reached the second paragraph.
   There was a long pause. Then Wally ``Famous'' Amos, the cookie
magnate and a spokesperson for the Literacy Volunteers of America,
approached the witness table, put his arm around Manley and spoke
softly to him.
   ``Just tell your story, how it came about,'' Simon told Manley
after Amos had returned to his seat. ``Don't worry about that
prepared statement. This takes more courage than anything you've
done on the football field.''
   Manley, obviously relieved, scrapped the statement and told
Simon and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., about receiving 19 grades
of ``F'' in second grade and being placed in a special education
class for four years.
   ``It was very difficult because I felt I was normal, but I was
told I was dumb and stupid. I had a lot of rejection in my life,''
Manley said. Athletics was the only thing ``that built some
self-esteem, some self-worth in Dexter Manley. Other than that I
had no identity.''
   Manley said special education consisted of ``more or less
playing with blocks'' with no instruction in phonics or other
skills needed to read.
   ``I was passed, of course, and that repeated itself all along,''
he said. He attributed his progress through the education system to
his willingness to show up for class, but added: ``It's amazing
that I've come this far. I've had a lot of tutoring, but I would
suspect that I was just passed through.''

   President Bush acknowledged on Thursday
that his $441 million program to reward excellence in education is
not ``a be-all and an end-all,'' and he challenged America's
business community to help improve schools.
   ``The fact is that unless we act, our children will be
ill-equipped to read, to write or to understand new technologies,
to compete in the work place,'' Bush said.
   ``And the fact is that education partnerships can help us act
boldly and urgently, to keep America No. 1,'' he said.
   Bush made his remarks in a speech en route to a four-day stay at
his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. On Saturday, he will meet
visiting President Francois Mitterrand of France.
   The two leaders will travel to Boston University on Sunday to
receive honorary degrees, make remarks at the school's commencement
exercises and hold a joint news conference. A week later, they will
gather in Brussels with other Western leaders for a NATO summit.
   Bush made his education speech at an Eastman Kodak photographic
plant. He praised the company for putting up some of the money that
he said helped one school overcome a high dropout rate and a poor
academic showing to become one of the top-rated schools in the
state.
   Before his address, Bush toured the school, the Wilson Magnet
High School, which offers special courses in computer science,
robotics, photo-optics and Japanese language studies.
   ``Rochester and Kodak embody the notion that helping others
through cooperation ... is America at her best,'' Bush said.
   Bush's education program offers $441 million for merit schools,
magnet schools and other programs. It has been criticized by
congressional Democrats and educators as insufficient.
   ``No, our program isn't a be-all and an end-all,'' Bush said.
``We're living in times of complicated resource allocation.
   ``But it is a commitment, a commitment to help business and
academia make America much more productive, a commitment to
partnerships, a commitment which you share.''
   The bulk of the money in Bush's bill, $250 million, would go for
a ``presidential merit schools'' program of cash awards to public
and private schools that make substantial progress in raising
student educational achievement, creating a safe and drug-free
environment and reducing the dropout rate.
   It also calls for $100 million in new spending on magnet schools
_ such as Wilson _ offering special courses.
   Bush said that in visiting Rochester, ``I honor the countless
individuals and companies across America who are following your
example.
   ``And to those not yet involved, I challenge you to get
involved,'' he said. ``For America's public and private sectors,
they can exceed the sum of their parts.''
   Before leaving Washington, Bush met at the White House with
Nobel Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and a South African
anti-apartheid delegation.
   The White House also hailed the Organization of American States
for adopting a resolution saying that Panamanian ruler Manuel
Antonio Noriega was responsible for ``abuses'' and the electoral
crisis in his country. The group also voted to send three foreign
minister to Panama to try to induce him to give up power.
   Saying the White House was pleased by the measure, press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``It does constitute a
condemnation of Noriega by name for his abuses of the electoral
process and calls for a transition of power. ... We're gratified
that all the OAS countries shared the United States' position.''
   In Kennebunkport, Bush took his speedboat out into the Atlantic
for a couple of hours. His motor got hung up on lobster track lines
and he had to hang overboard to untangle them while someone hung
onto his ankles.
   In the evening, the president went to a local restaurant to dine
on stuffed lobster with his wife Barbara and some aides.

<HEAD>Government Says It's Considering Lifting Emergency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering
lifting the national state of emergency when it expires in June
because anti-government protest has died down and the security
situation is fairly normal, an official said Thursday.
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe made the comments on
state-run television's evening newscast.
   ``The government is considering thoroughly all aspects of the
security system in the country in order to decide whether the
emergency should be reimposed or not,'' he said.
   ``The fact that things are fairly normal, there are not so many
people dying in these days, is not necessarily a full conclusion
that we don't need security arrangements.''
   Although van der Merwe made no promises, it appeared significant
that the issue of lifting the emergency was the first item
mentioned on the evening news.
   Van der Merwe has said in the past that when the government
wants to make a significant policy change, it prepares the public
for it by opening discussion on the issue.
   President P.W. Botha declared the national emergency on June 12,
1986, saying regular laws were insufficient to deal with widespread
violence in black townships, protest rallies and unrest against the
government's apartheid laws.
   Under apartheid, the black majority of 28 million has no say in
national affairs, and the 5 million whites control the economy and
have separate housing districts and schools.
   Botha's decrees under the emergency allow police nearly
unrestricted power to detain people indefinitely without charge,
close newspapers, ban meetings, rallies and church services, and
outlaw organizations.
   Individuals also may be prohibited from speaking in public, and
criticism against the government, police and the army can be banned.
   Monitoring groups say at least 30,000 people were detained
without charge under the emergency. Hundreds were freed following a
hunger strike among detainees earlier this year, and an estimated
50 people still are being held.
   Van der Mewe said the government could soften some criticism by
lifting the state of emergency, which has been condemned by
governments and human rights organizations around the world.
   But, he said, ``You cannot afford to let society lapse into
disorder again in order just to avoid criticism.''

   Dorothy Ruth Pirone, the daughter of
baseball great Babe Ruth, died at home Thursday. She was 68 years
old.
   Pirone lived in Durham for more than a dozen years, where she
raised Arabian horses.
   For most of her life, Pirone was led to believe that her mother
was Ruth's first wife, Helen, despite rumors to the contrary in the
press.
   In 1980, however, she learned that her real mother was a woman
she had grown up knowing and loving as a close family friend.
Pirone said last year she held no bitterness toward her father for
not revealing her true mother's identity.
   Last year, Pirone wrote a book about her famous father, ``My
Dad, the Babe.'' It was co-authored by Chris Martens and published
on the 40th anniversary of her father's death, Aug. 16, 1988.
   ``I think I did it more for myself and to show my father was not
the kind of person he was portrayed. I was very defensive of my
father and I can't help it,'' she said in an interview last year.
   Pirone died of natural causes, the family said through a
spokesman at the B.C. Bailey Funeral Home Inc., in Wallingford.
   Pirone, wife of the late Dominick L. Pirone, is survived by four
daughters, one son and 12 grandchildren.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Starr as Solicitor General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has approved the nomination of
conservative federal appeals court judge Kenneth W. Starr to be
solicitor general.
   Senators on Thursday approved by voice vote President Bush's
nomination of Starr to act as the federal government's chief
representative before the Supreme Court.
   To accept the solicitor general position, Starr, 42, will have
to forsake his lifetime appointment on the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   Many in legal circles considered Starr too young to want to
spend the rest of his career on the D.C. Circuit, and consider the
move a good way for Starr to put himself in the running for a
future nomination to the nation's highest court.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall gave up a federal judgeship to become
solicitor general in 1965, and two years later was named to the
Supreme Court by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson.
   Starr, who is from Virginia, was a clerk for former Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger and later a partner with the Los Angeles
law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. He served as counselor to
then-Attorney General William French Smith from 1981 until his
appointment to the D.C. Appeals Court in 1983.
   The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer.
He argues cases before the Supreme Court and decides whether to
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies.
   Starr will succeed Charles Fried, who resigned to return to
Harvard University Law School.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 8 grafs to UPDATE with attendance report; details

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first formal talks in months between the
striking teachers union and the school district took place under a
news blackout Thursday, with the situation muddied by conflicting
reports on school finances.
   The strike by at least 22,000 teachers in the nation's
second-largest district was in its fourth day, with the 600 schools
in the 700-square-mile district reduced to day-care facilities as
absenteeism ran high.
   Student attendance has declined steadily throughout the week. Of
the 551,759 students enrolled this quarter, 283,620 were counted
Thursday, down from 329,371 on Monday, the first day of the strike.
   Other than announcing the resumption of talks, neither side
would release any information on the first formal meeting since an
impasse in March.
   ``There is a total blackout,'' said United Teachers-Los Angeles
spokesman Don Schrack, on Thursday.
   The union negotiating team refused to disclose any details of
the talks, including time and place, to ensure that no information
would be released, Schrack said.
   ``That was something that was wanted and desired by both
sides,'' said Diana Munatones, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles
Unified School District.
   Union lawyers also sought a court order late Thursday to
prohibit the school district from halting monthly premium payments
to striking teachers, said Catherine Carey, a union spokeswoman.
   The district had on its side a fact-finder's report received
Wednesday agreeing it had no money to offer beyond a 21.5 percent
raise over three years.
   But confusion reigned after Gov. George Deukmejian announced the
same day that the state expects a $2.5 billion budget windfall over
the next two years.
   The state's Proposition 98 requires virtually all revenue above
an expenditure limit to be given to the schools. The
594,000-student Los Angeles district reportedly could receive $120
million to $228 million of that money.
   But School Board President Roberta Weintraub said the district
had no assurances it would get the money and could not sweeten its
wage offer.
   Deukmejian said he wants to enact budget reform and guide more
of the surplus toward transportation needs.
   United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, encouraged
by the windfall report, immediately changed the union's demand from
21 percent over two years to 26 percent over three years.
   Weintraub called that ``an impossible figure. It is not
acceptable.''
   ``If they stand firm, the union's strike is going to continue,''
said Johnson.
   The UTLA represents 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers,
nurses, counselors and librarians. The strike is the district's
first since a 23-day walkout in 1970.
   Currently, teachers' pay ranges from a beginning $23,440 to
$43,319 to those with doctorates, 98 extra course units and 19
years' experience.

   An attack force stormed Bellavista
prison Thursday in an apparent attempt to free jailed drug runners
and 15 people died before the attackers fled without accomplishing
their mission, police said.
   At least 12 inmates who tried to escape in the confusion and
three prison guards were killed during a two-hour battle, they
reported.
   Officers said about 20 men with bombs and automatic weapons
tried to shoot their way past guards in a wing of the penitentiary
that houses mainly drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas.
   Authorities reported that when police and soldiers arrived to
help the prison guards, most of the raiders fled.
   Bellavista lies six miles north of Medellin in northwest
Colombia, center of the powerful Medellin drug cartel.
   Among those housed in the targeted wing, known as Pavilion 5,
was Freddy Rodriguez, son of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, said to be a
leader of the Medellin Cartel. Officials said his fate was not
known immediately.
   Freddy Rodriguez was jailed two weeks ago on charges of illegal
weapons possession.
   It was not immediately known whether he was linked to the
planned escape.
   Bellavista, considered a low-security prison, has been the site
of three escapes since December. Some guards were fired for alleged
complicity in the escapes.
   Secretary-General Diogenes Plata of the Ministry of Justice said
in Bogota, the capital, that state security forces earlier found a
plan for a big breakout at a unspecified jail and that prison
guards nationwide were put on alert last week.
   ``Despite their outdated weapons, the prison guards were able to
repel the attack until they obtained help from the army and the
police, but unfortunately three of the guards died at the hands of
the attackers,'' Plata said.

   Torrential rains set off mudslides
that engulfed shantytowns in the northeastern city of Salvador on
Thursday, and at least 18 people were killed, fire department
officials said.
   Fireman Trindade de Santana said a slide in the outlying slum of
Calcada late Thursday afternoon swallowed five modest
concrete-block homes and killed a mother and her four daughters.
   ``A wall of mud rushed down the hill and buried them,'' de
Santana said by telephone from Salvador, a coastal city of 1.8
million people 1,055 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
   ``It happened so fast, they probably didn't have time to move.''
   Rescue workers with search lamps dug their way with hoes and
spades through chest-deep mud Thursday night looking for additional
victims.
   ``We're almost sure there's at least another 10 buried under
there,'' de Santana said.
   He said it rained almost without letup since last week, and a
particularly heavy downpour late Wednesday night apparently
triggered the mudslide. He said more rain was forecast for Friday.
   Earlier Thursday, in the impoverished Lobato district of
Salvador, a hillside fell away and buried 10 clay and
concrete-block houses, fireman Julio Cesar dos Santos said by phone.
   ``We know of at least 12 people who were killed when the houses
collapsed, and one person in another slum area who was drowned,''
dos Santos said.
   TV film footage on Globo TV, Brazil's largest commercial
network, showed helmeted firemen with hoes helping slum residents
clear mud from destroyed houses in a search for more victims.
   In Santo Amaro, a city 50 miles northwest of Salvador, six
people drowned and about 30,000 remained homeless as a result of
flooding last week, dos Santos said.

   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and Premier Li
Peng visited student hunger strikers before dawn Friday, praising
their ``good intentions'' but urging them to end their six-day
protest.
   The students said they would end their fast only when the
government agrees to their demands for negotiations. They said they
believed no progress would occur until Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
steps down.
   On Thursday, nearly a million people poured into central
Beijing, demanding Deng's resignation and expressing support for
the 3,000 students who are fasting for democratic reform.
   On Friday morning, thousands began flocking again to the square
in support of the students. Showers had turned Tiananmen Square
into a squalid squatters' camp, with students lying on dirty
blankets strewn across wet plastic sheets.
   ``Ziyang, dialogue, Ziyang, dialogue,'' the students chanted
when they first saw Zhao at 4:45 a.m.
   ``You have good intentions,'' the party general secretary was
quoted by the official Xinhua news agency as saying. ``The problems
you have raised will eventually be resolved. But things are
complicated and there must be a process to resolve these problems.''
   But Zhao, speaking to the fasters, said authorities ``hope you
will become calm and stop the hunger strike immediately.''
   Xinhua said students cheered and clapped when Zhao and Li made
their unscheduled appearance.
   But students who talked with the leaders said they were
disappointed with the visit because both men said they came as
individuals, not as government leaders.
   The students said Zhao appeared moved by the protest, and one
said Zhao's eyes brimmed with tears.
   The China Daily reported Friday that 50,000 people were
streaming into Beijing every day to demonstrate for freedom.
State-run radio said the protest has ``seriously affected
production in the Beijing area.''
   A source in the People's Liberation Army said troops from
outside Beijing were being moved into the city after the 38th Army,
which protects Beijing, notified authorities that it was unwilling
to suppress the protests.
   ``Soldiers from the 38th have seen this movement from the
beginning and they are very sympathetic,'' said the source.
   On Thursday, Li met with student leaders and told them the
hunger strike has thrown China into chaos. Students said no
progress was made in meeting their demands.
   Government and party leaders have been meeting representatives
from official student groups to discuss the monthlong student
campaign for a freer society and less official society.
   However, they have refused to recognize newly formed independent
student groups. The groups, which organized the protests, say the
government must negotiate with them, not the official student
groups.
   Sparked by sympathy for the striking students, the protests are
the most widespread in Communist China's 40-year history. Their
broad appeal is reminiscent of the People's Power movement in the
Philippines that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
   The main gripes are corruption and nepotism in the ruling
Communist Party and the government.
   Breakneck economic growth over the past decade has created
enormous possibilities for malfeasance and laid to rest the
Communists' revolutionary ideal of a simple, selfless existence.
   Nostalgia for such an ideal was reflected Thursday in the
posters of former leaders Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai that
appeared in the marching crowd.
   ``At least Chairman Mao was honest,'' said a worker from Hubei
province as he carried a lifesized poster of Mao. ``He even sent
his son to the Korean War. Nowadays, the leaders send their sons to
America.''
   Hundreds of thousands called for Deng, the 84-year-old leader
who started China on its road to reform in 1978, to step down.
   High school and elementary school students chanted, ``Xiaoping,
Xiaoping, 84-years-old and not very sharp!'' The Tianjin Academy of
Fine Arts brought out a 6-foot-tall skeleton and attached two small
bottles to its wrists. Deng's given name, Xiaoping, is a homonym
for ``small bottle.''
   Reports have said Deng plans to relinquish his active role in
setting policy after the Chinese-Soviet summit. Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev left China on Thursday.
   Protests occurred in dozens of other cities Wednesday and
Thursday, fasts in three and school boycotts in more than 40, the
official media reported.
   More than 2,000 of the fasters have been hospitalized since the
strike began Saturday, but 1,500 of them have returned to continue
the fast.
   Premier Li and pro-democracy student leaders held a tense
meeting in the Great Hall of the People Thursday that ended in
failure after student activist Wu'er Kaixi collapsed as he shouted
at the premier.
   The scene was unprecedented in Communist China with Wu'er, a
21-year-old education major at Beijing Normal University wearing
hospital pajamas and running shoes, shouting down the premier.
   ``Li started talking about friendship,'' said a student who was
at the meeting. ``Wu'er stood up and told him to stop playing games
and get down to business.''
   According to students at the meeting, Li told them if the
movement does not end ``it will be more chaotic than the Cultural
Revolution,'' a decade-long political struggle that left hundreds
of thousands dead.
   On Thursday, one motorcycle gang, the Dragons, sped up and down
Changan Avenue, revving their engines as they passed the party
headquarters,
   A woman with a black mini-skirt and leather go-go boots sat on
the back of one Honda with a flag that read, ``Long live
democracy.''

<TEXT>
   Martha Clarke, known primarily as a creator of
dream-like theater evenings, among them ``Vienna: Lusthaus'' and
``The Garden of Earthly Delights,'' entered another garden a decade
ago and created a ballet.
   She, Robert Barnett, artistic co-director of Pilobolus Dance
Theater, and Felix Blaska, who has directed a dance company,
choreographed the 10-minute ``The Garden of Villandry'' and danced
its premiere in Paris in 1979.
   On Thursday night, American Ballet Theater performed it for the
first time in this city, at the Metropolitan Opera House. Martine
Van Hamel, Kevin McKenzie and Michael Owen were the trio _ or
triangle. Pianist Howard Barr, violinist Dennis Cleveland and
cellist Eric Bartlett were the on-stage players of a Schubert trio.
   Miss Van Hamel is embraced and eloquently partnered by first one
then the other of the men. No story is discernable as the three
stroll and dance in the famous _ here imagined _ gardens of a Loire
Valley chateau. The three don't seem to be a family. Their
affection seems excessive for friends taking the air. One thing is
clear; there's no jealousy. While one man is lifting the ballerina
in her long, bustled skirt, the other leans back nonchalantly,
hands in pockets.
   At one point, the two men swing Miss Van Hamel between them. It
doesn't look like the usual swinging of a ballerina but as though
she's sitting in a swing hanging from a tree. The audience,
realizing that, laughed.
   The effect is of a pleasant afternoon outing.
   On Tuesday, Amanda McKerrow and John Gardner danced company
dancer Clark Tippet's latest work, the 25-minute duet ``Some
Assembly Required.'' They also danced the ballet's premiere in
Washington in April. Music is William Bolcom's ``Second Sonata for
Violin and Piano,'' played by Lawrence Shapiro and Barr.
   This long pas de deux begins with Gardner, in T-shirt and jeans,
spending a lot of time on the floor, as the pony-tailed Miss
McKerrow spins and jumps over him. He carries her around, his knees
bent, with her feet on his thighs. Then he lifts her to his
shoulders and again slides to the floor.
   The choreography follows the music and in the second movement,
which Bolcom named ``Brutal-fast,'' the steps also are fast.
Gardner repeatedly flings her away, becoming almost menacing here,

<TEXT>
   The Senate approved the nomination of
conservative federal appeals court judge Kenneth W. Starr on
Thursday to be solicitor general.
   Senators approved by voice vote President Bush's nomination of
Starr to act as the federal government's chief representative
before the Supreme Court.
   Starr, who is from Virginia, will have to give up his lifetime
appointment on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia to accept the solicitor general position.
   Many in legal circles regard the move as a means for Starr to
put himself in the running for a future nomination to the nation's
highest court.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall gave up a federal judgeship to become
solicitor general in 1965, and two years later was named to the
Supreme Court by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson.
   Starr, 42, was a clerk for former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger
and later a partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp;
Crutcher. He served as counselor to then-Attorney General William
French Smith from 1981 until he was appointed to the D.C. Appeals
Court in 1983.
   The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer,
arguing cases before the Supreme Court and deciding whether to
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies.
   Starr will succeed Charles Fried, who resigned to return to
Harvard University Law School.

   Rappelling down the side of a 23-story
building to save an unhatched peregrine falcon egg was ``absolutely
worth it,'' even though the egg proved to be infertile, a state
preservationist said Thursday.
   ``There are so few peregrines left we had to try,'' said Thomas
French, the head of the state's endangered species program.
   French, who donned a hard hat and gauntlets to protect himself
from the diving attacks of the parent birds, said he actually felt
more comfortable inching down the office building Wednesday than he
has climbing some high cliffs to band young ravens.
   ``I had so much gear on I was perfectly safe,'' he said. ``It's
really all in the mind.''
   ``The adults popped me a few times on the head and the hand as I
was going down, and once on my boot as I was sitting on the
ledge,'' French said. ``But mostly all I could feel was the whoosh
of wings and the wind as they passed.''
   He estimated that the adults, which can reach speeds of 185 mph,
dived at him at speeds of about 60 mph to 70 mph even in the tight
quarters.
   French sent the egg up to the roof in a can. But after taking it
to his Conway home in hopes of incubating it, Thomas P. Ricardi, a
master falconer, said it contained no embryo.
   ``My heart kind of sank,'' Ricardi said.
   Two other eggs in the nest on a ledge at the 21st floor had
already hatched, the first to do so here in more than 40 years.
   If the remaining egg could have been hatched, the chick would
have been returned to the nest under a state program to preserve
the species, he said.
   Falcons, swift predators that had all but disappeared from the
East Coast because of damage by the now-banned pesticide DDT, are
begining to make a comeback after more than a decade of private and
governmental efforts in the United States and Canada, French said.
   ``In 1966 there were no breeding pairs left in the East, except
in northern Canada,'' he said. ``Now we have 80 breeding pairs and
we've reached a turning point where we have more breeding pairs in
the wild than in captivity.''
   Since 1974, the private Peregrine Fund has raised more than
1,000 birds for release in both urban and rural areas, he said.
   Although they normally nest on high cliffs, peregrines have
taken a liking to the high ledges of city skyscrapers where they
can indulge their taste for pigeons.
   Massachusetts released young falcons in Boston and Amherst. But
the Springfield pair, including a female released in Toronto as
part of the Canadian government's restoration program, found this
Connecticut River city on their own. The male is also banded, but
officials haven't yet determined his origin.

   Environmentalists lost a major court
battle over the rare northern spotted owl Thursday when a federal
judge lifted a ban on logging vast tracts of old-growth forests
administered by the U.S. government.
   U.S. District Judge Helen Frye granted a summary judgment
Thursday in favor of the Bureau of Land Management and lifted a
preliminary injunction that had prohibited the logging of
old-growth forests within 2.1 miles of spotted owl habitats.
   Pending any further appeals by the environmentalists, the BLM
said, the ruling clears the way for sale of 337 million board feet
of old-growth timber in western Oregon that has been tied up in
legal challenges since last summer.
   The lawsuit was filed against the federal agency by the Portland
Audubon Society and other environmental groups. They had contended
the BLM's timber management plans failed to adequately protect
old-growth forests, where the rare northern spotted owl lives and
hunts.
   The owl has been proposed for listing as a threatened species by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Andy Kerr, conservation director for one of the plaintiffs, the
Oregon Natural Resources Council, said his group was disappointed
but not surprised by the decision and added that the case likely
would be appealed.
   ``If this ruling stands, it would only serve to make the listing
of the northern spotted owl under the Engangered Species Act all
the more compelling,'' Kerr said.
   Frye ruled that the environmental groups' request was too broad
and that appeals would have to be made on a case-by-case basis.
   In a 73-page opinion, she ruled that the Audubon Society's
challenge ``does not seek judicial review of an activity of the BLM
based on site-specific new information, such as the discovery of a
bald eagle nest or an archeological `find' or a blow down of timber
on a particular sale location.
   ``The Portland Audubon Society's challenge cannot reasonably be
characterized as a challenge to a `particular activity' for which
judicial review is available,'' the judge wrote.
   ``They can't challenge our management plans, they have to
challenge individual sales,'' said BLM spokesman Ed Ciliberti.
   Despite her ruling, however, the judge was severely critical of
the BLM's failure to alter its management plans to take into
account new information.
   She said the agency's action ``was arbitrary and capricious in
light of the new, significant, and probably accurate information
that the planned logging of spotted owl habitat raises uncertainty
about the ability of the spotted owl to survive as a species.''
   Ciliberti said the BLM would prepare a detailed summary judgment
for Frye's approval, then would determine what step to take next.
   ``I think frankly we're pleased that she's ruled the way she
has,'' he said, ``but I think a substantial statement will have to
wait until our lawyers review the opinion.''
   He said the agency wouldn't be able to proceed with timber sales
in old-growth timber until Frye signs the judgment, and he noted
the environmental groups could appeal.
   ``We do have some sales that are on the shelf that have been
fully prepared that we might be able to put forth fairly quickly,''
Ciliberti said.
   Frye had dismissed the lawsuit in April 1988. But, last June,
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction forbidding
new timber sales within 2.1 miles of spotted owl nests on BLM land
in Western Oregon.
   The injunction held up despite repeated challenges by the timber
industry. As a result, the BLM had to cut its planned timber
offerings for the year by one third.
   The appeals court returned the case to Frye, who issued a
preliminary injunction Feb. 9 reaffirming the logging ban.

<TEXT>
   t
   MOSCOW (AP) _ Soviet officials publicly asserted for the first
time on Thursday that Moscow has halted arms shipments to
Nicaragua, but President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua himself said
otherwise.
   The Soviet claim met with skepticism from U.S. officials when it
was communicated earlier in private.
   And on Thursday Ortega denied in Nicaragua that the Soviets had
stopped supplying arms to his Central American nation, saying they
continue to fulfill their commitments to his leftist Sandinista
government.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told a regular
news briefing, ``The United States is very well aware that the
Soviet Union is exercising a certain restraint, and in fact for a
certain time has not been shipping any armaments to Nicaragua.''
   Yan A. Burlyai, an official in the ministry's Latin American
department, echoed that claim, but neither man gave reporters an
exact date for any halt of arms shipments to Nicaragua.
   Asked by one reporter to spell out for how long a period the
Soviets had stopped the weapons deliveries, Burlyai replied only
that it was ``not one day, not two days, not one week; it's much
more.''
   Burlyai also said shipments of food, medicine and bandages to
the Sandinistas could not be properly considered military
assistance, leaving open the possibility that such deliveries by
the Soviets continue.
   U.S. officials on Monday disclosed that Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev had written President Bush that arms supplies to
Nicaragua would halt. But the White House said Tuesday no proof
emerged that Gorbachev had made good on his promise.
   When a reporter asked Ortega in Niquinohomo, Nicaragua, on
Thursday about the Gorbachev letter, Ortega smilingly replied, ``We
have normal relations ... with the Soviet Union in the fields of
economic aid, military aid. The Soviet Union has met all of its
agreements with Nicaragua.''
   He added, however, he is ``in favor of reaching an
understanding'' regarding foreign military aid to Central America
under the Esquipulas regional peace pact.
   Under the pact, signed Aug. 7, 1987 by Ortega and the presidents
of Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala, foreign aid
would end to irregular forces in the region. That is understood to
mean no Soviet aid to the leftist Salvadoran guerrillas and no U.S.
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   Ortega was in Niquinohomo, a small town 20 miles south of the
capital of Managua, to speak on the 94th anniversary of the birth
of Gen. Augusto Cesar Sandino, the nationalist rebel leader from
whom the Sandinistas take their name.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters in
Washington on Wednesday that the Soviet Union may have halted arms
shipments to Nicaragua, but weapons were continuing to arrive from
Cuba and Moscow's East European allies. He said the level and
pattern of arms shipments through April was similar to that last
year.
   Boucher said the Soviet Union and its allies sent 27 shipments
of military goods to Nicaragua through April.
   ``We are not shipping any armaments,'' Burlyai said Thursday,
while indicating that Soviet shipments of other goods for the
Sandinista army may be continuing.
   In other remarks made by Ortega in Niquinohomo:
   _He charged that the right-wing party of Salvadoran
President-elect Alfredo Cristiani was responsible for several
murders, including that of Archbishop Arnulfo Romero of El Salvador
in 1980.
   _He condemned what he called U.S. intervention in Panama and
Wednesday's vote in the Organization of American States, saying:
``The Yankees impose the points of discussion on the Latin American
agenda.''
   The OAS voted to send a commission to Panama to investigate
charges of fraud in the May 7 elections, which the government later
annulled.

   An Air Force fighter jet practicing a
low-flying stunt with another jet Thursday clipped a broadcast
tower's support wire, toppling the tower and knocking one radio and
two television stations off the air.
   The damaged F-15 Eagle made an emergency landing at Tyndall Air
Force Base near Panama City after the accident in this Florida
Panhandle hamlet, said a spokeswoman at Tyndall, Marilyn Silcox.
   There were no reported injuries in the 2:30 p.m. incident,
officials said.
   ``The entire tower was knocked flat on the ground,'' said
Cynthia Gould, news anchorwoman for television station WMBB.
   The loss of the 1,549-foot-tall tower knocked WMBB, public
television station WFSG and commercial radio station WPAP off the
air, Ms. Gould said.
   The F-15 jet's left landing gear was damaged, forcing the pilot,
an instructor assigned to the 2nd Tactical Fighter Training
Squadron, to balance the plane on its nose wheel and right landing
gear during the landing, said Capt. Carolyn Hodge, a public affairs
officer.
   Both the jet and the second F-15 that it was attempting to
intercept had been cleared to fly as low as 500 feet, Ms. Hodge
said.
   It is the second accident involving a Tyndall-based F-15 jet
this month. Another jet crashed into the Gulf of Mexico on May 1,
killing a student pilot who had been practicing dogfighting tactics.

   Four new parties obtained legal
status, raising to 17 the number of political groups that could
take part in next February's general balloting, officials said
Thursday.
   Opposition groups, however, are still disputing the fairness of
the electoral laws, and it is not yet known how many of them will
run candidates to challenge the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front.
   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday the political opposition
should not expect any more reforms.
   ``There will be no more concessions. I want this to be very
clear,'' Ortega said. ``The reforms that were going to take place
have taken place and that's the end of it.''
   Ortega made his comment during a speech Thursday evening in
Niquinohomo, a small community 25 miles south of Managua, where
Gen. Augusto Cesar Sandino was born. The speech was on the occasion
of the 94th anniversary of the birth of Sandino, from whom the
Sandinista National Liberation Front takes its name.
   Five groups asking for legal recognition as political parties
were rejected by the National Council of Political Parties. The
council approved the request of four other parties, said Orlando
Tardencilla, secretary to council president Hugo Mejia.
   One group, the Authentic Liberal Party, was denied legal status
because its slogan, ``Neither Somocism Nor Marxism,'' harmed
another party, the Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement,
Tardencilla said. Somocism refers to support for the regime of late
President Anastasio Somoza, whom the Sandinistas ousted in the
1978-79 revolution.
   The council rejected another group, the Conservative National
Union, because although its statutes formally speak against foreign
intervention, they accept it ``when a government fails to respect
the principles of Western democracy.''
   Other groups were turned down because they had the same names as
legally constituted parties or did not meet minimum requirements
under the law.
   Critics say the reforms in election and news media laws were
passed by the Sandinista-dominated National Assembly, or
legislature, without considering opposition demands. They say the
reforms are merely cosmetic and still give the Sandinistas an
unfair advantage.
   In a letter to the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired
by Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the opposition repeated its
complaints and accused the government of failing to live up to its
commitments of democratic reforms in a regional peace accord.
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez said his government ``cannot
accept that the National Reconciliation Commission become a
negotiating panel between the government and the opposition because
this is not its role.''
   Under a Central American peace accord signed in February,
President Daniel Ortega moved up elections by 10 months to Feb. 25,
1990, and promised legal reforms to ensure the balloting is free
and fair.
   Ortega and his colleagues from El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica
and Guatemala also agreed to draft a plan by May 15 to dismantle
the Nicaraguan rebel force now encamped in Honduras near the
Nicaraguan border. The deadline was later extended to a yet
unspecified date in July by mutual accord.

   Students heading the largest demonstrations ever
to confront Communist China have specific demands they say must be
met before they halt their protests, and less defined demands for
changing the long-range political character of China.
   Their conditions for ending a hunger strike by thousands of
students on Tiananmen Square center around demands for government
recognition of their new, independent student organizations.
   As a first step, the students say, the government must engage in
a televised dialogue with student representatives. Acknowledgement
of the activist groups as the voice of the students must follow.
   The government has talked to delegates from official student
unions, but has balked at recognizing the new student-elected
groups.
   One major factor is government concern that independent student
groups could be followed by workers breaking away from the
state-controlled trade unions and interest groups forming political
parties opposing the ruling Communist Party.
   Students also demand that the government apologize to the nation
through the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, for its
criticisms of the student movement. Students are particularly
incensed over an April 26 editorial that accused the students of
being agitators bent on causing social turmoil.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and other leaders now refer to
the students as ``patriotic'' and have met student demands that
there be no violence or recriminations against them. But they have
not responded on the issue of a written apology.
   The broader demands are less defined, but focus on official
corruption, press freedom and the resignation of top leaders.
   Students have demanded that senior officials disclose their
incomes as one step toward ending the corruption _ bribery,
influence-peddling, profiteering in scarce goods and nepotism _
that is rampant among officials and bureaucrats.
   Student demands for press freedom have in part already brought
about significant changes. The state-run press, pressured by
journalists supporting the students, has given extensive,
sympathetic and factual coverage to the demonstrations. Before the
current protests, that would have been impossible.
   The students continue to demand the rehabilitation of Qin Benli,
editor of Shanghai's liberal World Economic Herald, who was removed
from his job in the early days of the protest for attempting to
print articles critical of government leaders. Authorities have
since stopped publication of the weekly.
   Although student leaders have not come out against the
government, many protest participants are carrying banners and
signs demanding the resignation of top officials.
   A main target is 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, the father of
China's economic reforms, who students say is now too old to
understand the rapid changes China is undergoing.
   Students also are calling for Premier Li Peng to step down. Li
is accused of incompetance and is generally associated with more
conservative factions who favor slowing economic and political
reforms.
   Students also have demanded more money for the nation's
underfunded and inadequate educational facilities and better
treatment for teachers, among the nation's poorest civil servants.

   President Bush promises to veto ``faster than

lawmakers are confident Bush will win his first domestic-policy
clash with Capitol Hill's majority Democrats.
   ``There are enough votes in the Senate to support a presidential
veto,'' Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said Wednesday before the
Senate gave 63-37 approval to legislation increasing the minimum
wage for the first time in eight years.
   Dole's prediction was borne out by the fact that the final vote
was four votes short of the margin that would be required to enact
the bill over a Bush veto.
   Democrats pushing the measure vowed nonetheless to press their
case with the president and, while refusing in advance to concede
defeat, said they would advance another bill if Bush's first veto
is sustained.

   The mushroom treatment is not the latest in
French cuisine and Fort Fumble is not on the list of Defense
Department installations to be closed down next year.
   Both are examples of Pentagonese, that pinnacle of bureaucratic
jargon used by the men and women responsible for America's national
security.
   Fort Fumble, the Fudge Factory and the Five-Sided Wailing Wall
are names used more or less affectionately by the 23,000 people who
work daily in the 3.7 million square feet of office space in the
Pentagon.
   Jargon may be the most distinguishing feature of the building,
erected in the early months of World War II in a style known as
``early ugly.'' But on closer inspection, Pentagon palaver
resembles that of other big bureaucracies in which separate offices
compete for money, attention and jobs.
   As in any bureaucracy, those who work in the Pentagon but
haven't learned the lingo risk the mushroom treatment, defined by
author Perry Smith as being kept in the dark and fed on manure. Or
something equally tasty.
   The retired Air Force major general, in his book ``Assignment
Pentagon,'' has compiled a glossary not only of Defense Department
gobbledygook, but of the acronyms that the military uses, in
Smith's words, as a ``shortcut language'' for defense issues.
   BMEWS, for example, is not a verb meaning to stupify, but is the
nation's Ballistic Miissile Early Warning System. GWEN is not a
woman's name, but the Ground Wave Emergency Network.
   MIRV and SAM are deadly Multiple Independently Targeted Re-entry
Vehicles and Surface-to-Air Missiles. JSTARS is not a breakfast
cereal but the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System.
   MAD is already familar as Mutual Assured Destruction. MOA and
MOU are not fruit from South Seas, but a Memorandum of Agreement
and a Memorandum of Understanding.
   POLs are not the folks elected to Congress, but Petroleum, Oil
and Lubricants. SLEP is not Yiddish for ``to carry,'' but is the
Surface Life Extension Program for aircraft carriers.
   WARMAPS are not what you think, but Wartime Manpower Planning
Systems. And WTVD is not an easy-listening station, but a combined
English and Russian acronym for the Western Theater of Military
Operations, the European front.
   The glossary includes these other tidbits:
   _Above my pay grade: perhaps the most commonly heard expression
along the 13{ miles of Pentagon corridor. It means, ``Go ask
someone more important.''
   _Analysis paralysis: what happens when you study excessively.
   _Bears: big bosses. ``Feeding the bears'' means giving
information to senior commanders.
   _Bedbug letter: An effusive, non-responsive answer to a
complainer, similar to one from the president of a motel chain who
never mentions the bedbugs in his letter of apology.
   _Bells and whistles: hyperbole to sell a weapons system.
   _Bow wave: large financial requirements that appear on future
rather than current budgets.
   _BFO: a blazing flash of the obvious.
   _Elephants: another word for big bosses, as in, ``Let's solve
this before the elephants get involved.''
   _Elevator speech: a short two- or three-minute briefing.
   _Face time: time spent near big bosses in attempts to impress
them with diligence and loyalty.
   _Night face: face time with bosses at night (counts twice as
much as day face time).
   _Weekend face: counts four times as much as day face.
   _Go ballistic: get overly excited.
   _Gold plate: add lots of systems to a weapons platform.
   _Pearl Harbor file: a complete record of an action so that when
disaster strikes you can trace the course that led to the disaster.
   _Purple suiter: an officer who works in a joint command, as
distinct from a purely Army (green), Air Force (blue) or Navy
(white or black) command.
   _Scrub down: eliminate unneeded funds or paper from a project.
   _Tap dance: a slick briefing, usually lacking substance.

<HEAD>NBC Gives Faded `Miami Vice' Honorable Send-Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC is showing some class this weekend by giving
its now-lukewarm but once sizzling detective series ``Miami Vice''
an honorable sendoff in a special two-hour conclusion Sunday.
   The series that launched Don Johnson's career and a wave of
fashion trends is leaving the air after five seasons. Unlike ABC,
which allowed its once-ballyhooed ``Moonlighting'' to whimper away
in so-so final episode that ended up at the bottom of the Nielsens,
NBC is giving ``Vice'' the coveted Sunday movie slot.
   The producers and the network have refused to pre-screen or
discuss the episode in order to keep the ending a secret. But
executive producer Michael Mann has a penchant for the dramatic. He
ended ``Crime Story'' _ prematurely, it turned out _ by
incinerating his villains with no less than an atomic bomb.
   When ``Miami Vice'' premiered in 1984, it amazed jaded
television critics with its fresh writing, charmingly seedy
characters and art deco Miami landscapes. The show derived from a
now-fabled scribble of an idea by NBC Entertainment President
Brandon Tartikoff _ ``MTV cops.''
   Anthony Yerkovich, a producer-writer on ``Hill Street Blues,''
created the characters and wrote the two-hour pilot, which still
stands as one of the best cop shows ever.
   The look came from Michael Mann, then a relatively obscure film
director (``The Jericho Mile,'' ``Thief'') who knew how to put film
and rock music together in a way that made hair stand up on the
back of necks _ beginning with the opening montage set to pounding,
synthesized Caribbean rhythms created by Jan Hammer.
   Thomas Carter (``Hill Street'') directed the first episode, and
American TV entered a new era of style _ cool colors, hot sounds.
Straight-from-the-charts music such as Phil Collins' ``In the Air
Tonight'' wafted from television speakers in the middle of network
prime time.
   The show didn't catch on in the ratings until summer reruns,
when word of mouth got around. In later seasons, the kids' favorite
show met its ratings demise, ironically enough, at the hands of
CBS' aging, night-time soap ``Dallas.''
   In the beginning, ``Vice'' viewers were as intrigued by the
characters as the color scheme. Don Johnson was virtual unknown,
with a credit list of failed pilots and ignominious movie parts.
But he connected with Sonny Crockett, a down-at-the-heels former
football star who lived on a boat guarded by an alligator named
Elvis.
   Another unknown, Philip Michael Thomas, played Ricardo Tubbs, an
interloping black cop from the New York streets who came to Miami
looking for his brother's murderer. City slicker Tubbs and
good-ol'-boy Crockett were the classic odd couple and were,
naturally, forced to become partners. NBC will try the unlikely
buddies concept again in a new cop show, ``Hardball,'' that goes
into ``Vice's'' time period next season.
   ``Vice'' might have impressed the critics, but it was virtually
ignored by the Hollywood establishment. It won only a handful of
technical Emmy Awards, except for Edward James Olmos' 1985 win as
best supporting actor in a drama. Olmos joined the cast midway
through the first season as Martin Castillo, a mysterious, taciturn
successor to the cops' first boss (Gregory Sierra, who left the
series).
   If the industry establishment ignored ``Vice,'' the feeling was
mutual. Mann shunned the usual TV writers and hired playwrights and
authors to create his scripts. He bypassed the pool of Hollywood
regulars and cast New York stage actors in guest roles.
   The late playwright Miguel Pinero (``Short Eyes'') wrote for
``Vice,'' and played Tubbs' archrival Calderon. Bruce Willis, who
later became a star on ``Moonlighting,'' had only an Off Broadway
production of ``Fool for Love'' to his credit when he was cast as
an arms dealer-wife beater in an episode. Rock star Glenn Frey made
his acting debut in an episode based on his song ``Smuggler's
Blues.''
   The show took chances. In a remarkably sophisticated episode,
``Evan,'' Crockett and a one-time partner (William Russ) confronted
their long-hidden mutual guilt over the suicide of another partner
they had rejected because of his homosexuality.
   In the last three seasons, the show drifted away from character
development and flirted with self-parody. It still hit the mark
sometimes, but by then was taken for granted.
   ``Vice'' lives on _ on cable. USA Network bought the reruns.

   `SUNDAY NIGHT' GOES GENERIC _ NBC has renewed ``Sunday Night,''
with a new title: ``Michelob Presents Night Music,'' so stations
can carry it in other-than-Sunday, late-night time periods. The
critically praised hour-long music series from ``Saturday Night
Live'' producer Lorne Michaels features eclectic blends of jazz,
rock and blues overseen by hosts David Sanborn and Jools Holland.
It airs on NBC-owned stations and in syndication on other stations.

   NBC, the network of known quantities, has
enlisted such tried-and-true stars as Doris Day, Loretta Young,
Elizabeth Taylor and Anthony Quinn for a wave of star-driven,
1989-90 made-for-TV movies.
   The word ``reprise'' occurs frequently in NBC's list of upcoming
projects for the fall:
   Jack Klugman and Tony Randall will reprise their roles as ``The
Odd Couple,'' the popular series inspired by the movie.
   Randy Quaid will reprise his Emmy-nominated performance as
Lyndon B. Johnson in ``LBJ: The Presidential Years,'' a sequel to
``LBJ: The Early Years.'' Patti Lupone returns as Lady Bird Johnson.
   Also reprised is ``Eight Is Enough.'' The Bradford clan will
reunite for another reunion movie, this time ``An Eight Is Enough
Wedding.''
   Reprised, too, are fact-based dramas.
   Daniel J. Travanti (``Hill Street Blues'') stars as a prosecutor
in ``Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder,'' based on the
real-life racially motivated Queens attack.
   NBC will make a miniseries about Drug Enforcement Agent Enrique
``Kiki'' Camarena, who was murdered by drug dealers. ``Desperados:
The `Kiki' Camarena Story'' will star Steven Bauer, Elizabeth Pena
and Craig T. Nelson.
   ``Murder In Mississippi'' will recount the final days of three
civil rights workers murdered in 1963. The TV movie is something of
a prequel to the Oscar-nominated film ``Mississippi Burning,''
which was a fictionalized account of the investigation into the
slayings.
   ``The Rock Hudson Story'' will be told in a TV movie. No casting
has been announced.
   ``Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer'' was to have aired this season,
but was held over. It is based on Mrs. Pulitzer's autobiographical
account of her messy divorce from Herbert ``Pete'' Pulitzer.
   When not re-creating real-life stories, NBC's movies will be
based on classics. There is a two-part miniseries of ``Phantom of
the Opera'' in the offing. The miniseries is based on the Gaston
Leroux novel, not the hit Broadway musical. Anthony Quinn will star
in Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' Elizabeth Taylor
plays a faded movie queen and Mark Harmon the drifter she becomes
involved with in Tennessee Williams' ``Sweet Bird of Youth.''
Nicholas Roeg (``Track 29,'' ``The Man Who Fell to Earth'') directs
in his television debut.
   Loretta Young has been cast as ``Lady in a Corner,'' a respected
editor of an international magazine that an infamous publisher
wants to take over.
   Doris Day will star in the comedy ``Running Mates,'' as a woman
in a small, Southern California town who runs against an
interloping movie star for mayor in order to stop his plan to turn
the community into a tourist attraction _ shades of Clint Eastwood
who was elected mayor of Carmel, Calif.
   In a new-season preview for advertisers last week, NBC
Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff showed clips of the five
new series that will join the network's prime-time schedule and
revealed some changes in returning shows.
   ``ALF'' will be getting into comic trouble caring for the
Tanners' new baby. The series will also get a new cast member, yet
unnamed, who will play Willie Tanner's brother.
   Lisa Bonet will return to the nest in ``The Cosby Show.'' The
spinoff she spun off to have a baby, ``A Different World,'' will
make a transition, too. Tartikoff says ``a mystery wedding'' will
begin the season.
   Rod Parker and Hal Cooper, producers on ``Empty Nest,'' are
going over to ``Dear John,'' in an apparent effort to relieve
tension on the set. Executive producer Ed. Weinberger will stay on.
   Tartikoff stressed that the network has ``the best bench since
Johnny,'' referring to shows waiting in the wings. The network only
needed four hours of new programming to fine-tune its No. 1
prime-time schedule. NBC will add two half-hour shows: ``Nutt
House,'' a slapstick Mel Brooks comedy with Harvey Korman and
Cloris Leachman running a New York hotel; and ``Sister Kate,''
starring Stephanie Beacham as a tough nun with a herd of orphans to
manage. The one-hour new shows are ``Baywatch,'' a lifeguard drama;
``Hardball,'' a mismatched-partners cop show; and ``Mancuso FBI,''
a spinoff of the political intrigue thriller ``Favorite Son.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   NEW NEW ORLEANS SHOW _ Fans of the Big Easy frustrated by CBS'
cancellation of ``Frank's Place'' have a new New Orleans-set show
waiting in the wings. Emmy winner Alfre Woodard and ``Sonny Spoon''
star Mario Van Peebles head the cast of the NBC pilot ``Orleans,''
from former ``L.A. Law'' co-executive producer Terry Louise Fisher.
Elizabeth Ashley and Roy Thinnes also star. ...
   BIG BIRD AND FRIENDS _ On June 22, the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History will open an exhibit honoring
the PBS children's series ``Sesame Street,'' commemorating its 20
years on the air. On the reasonable assumption that many of the
exhibit's visitors might be of the non-adult persuasion, the museum
will put photos on display at two different levels _ one at
standard grown-up eye level and the other a bit closer to the floor.

<HEAD>Struggling Mining Town Pins Hope of Revival on Bavarian Theme</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KELLOGG, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When local boosters chose a Bavarian theme
to turn this depressed mining town into a fairy-tale tourist
village, they had in mind a Cinderella transformation.
   After four years, what they've got is more like Beauty and the
Beast.
   A quaint wooden sign proclaiming ``Willkommen zu Kellogg'' sits
near a mile-long heap of mining debris. Downtown, false-fronted
shops mimicking old German architecture share Main Street with
dumpy, dirty brick buildings.
   Kellogg is not the first down-and-out Western town to try to
revive itself by dressing up as something it's not. Tourists with a
good road map and a willingness to suspend their disbelief can find
simulated frontier cowboy towns, Bavarian hamlets and 19th-century
mining villages scattered across the West.
   But the ``theme town'' concept, successful in some places, faces
a serious challenge in this northern Idaho town. After four years
of having its seamier side covered up, painted over or carted away,
Kellogg still resembles more the rough mining town it is than the
charming village it wants to be.
   That does not daunt town fathers, who remember how things were.
Grocer Bob Chapman sums it up by describing his cavernous metal
warehouse store, now trimmed with stained wood and painted flowers:
``It's still ugly, but it's improved a great deal.''
   Life in Kellogg couldn't have gotten much worse than it was in
1981, when the Bunker Hill silver-lead-zinc mine closed.
Unemployment soared to 50 percent, and $80,000 homes suddenly
became $30,000 homes, when a buyer could be found at all.
   It was small comfort that Bunker Hill's two towering smokestacks
no longer belched noxious smelter fumes across the valley. Years of
smoke had already done their damage, turning once-forested hills
into barren, eroded slopes and lacing the yards and gardens of
Kellogg with toxic lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury.
   The 1980 census counted 3,417 people in Kellogg. By 1986, that
number had fallen 22 percent to 2,650. As city leaders watched
business after business fold, they desperately sought something to
keep Kellogg alive.
   They found it in Leavenworth, Wash., a little town in the
Cascade Range that adopted a Bavarian alpine theme in 1966 when it,
too, was on the edge of ruin. Now the thriving village of 1,400
boasts 26 gift shops and 19 restaurants, all meticulously fashioned
after the quaint shops and cottages of old Bavaria.
   Kellogg set out to copy that success. Civic leaders started a
mural-painting, flower-planting campaign. The city council passed
an ordinance to require that all commercial construction or
remodeling be done in the Bavarian theme and be approved by a
design review committee.
   The centerpiece of the town's conversion was to be a 3.1-mile
tram ride linking the town's center and a nearby ski area. But no
private investor would touch the risky venture. It took a $6.4
million federal grant _ assailed by President Reagan as pork barrel
but approved December 1987 by Congress _ to make the gondola
project a reality.
   Construction began last month, and boosters say the gondola will
kick Kellogg's conversion into high gear.
   A kick clearly is needed. Fewer than 25 percent of the buildings
downtown have gone Bavarian _ and even those aren't entirely
convincing.
   On one block, a jewelry store masquerades as a turreted castle,
next to a pawn shop with a ski chalet facade, next to a dress store
painted like a quaint country cottage, next to a flower shop with a
clock tower that chimes tunes from ``The Sound of Music.''
   ``People come in and say this isn't really Bavarian. We say we
don't care _ it looks nice,'' said City Clerk Terry Sharp.
   There are local critics, too, including Dennis Seagraves, owner
of Dirty Ernie's tavern. His only concession to Bavaria _ at the
review committee's insistence _ is the Old English lettering on his
sign.
   ``When I was growing up, I thought you had freedom of choice,''
he said. ``With the Bavarian theme, you either do it their way or
you don't do it at all.''
   Pauline Watson, a Leavenworth gift shop owner and traveling
consultant on theme towns, has doubts about Kellogg's chance of
success. She has seen many communities get excited about becoming a
theme town, only to lose steam when they realize the financial
investment and long-term commitment involved. ``People see it as a
magic cure, but it's not,'' she said.
   Sometimes it does work: Leavenworth has prospered, and so has
Solvang, Calif., drawing tourists with a Danish theme since the
1940s. Winthrop, Wash., has become a convincing Old West town.
Kimberley, British Columbia, has gone Bavarian. And just 12 miles
from Kellogg, the town of Wallace, Idaho, is trying to build on its
silver-mining heritage.
   Kellogg is at a disadvantage, Watson said, because it is far
from a large population center and its business district is too
spread out to concentrate shoppers.
   But Kellogg's boosters prefer to dwell on the positive. They
cite the allure of northern Idaho's mountains, lakes, rivers and
forests. And they say Interstate 90, which cuts through town, will
carry in money-spending motorists.
   There are other reasons for optimism, they say. The Bunker Hill
mine has reopened on a smaller scale, employing fewer workers but
sparing residents the pall of smelter smoke by shipping its ore
elsewhere for processing.
   A few eroded hills around town still can't support vegetation,
but most slopes now sprout lines of planted pines and firs. And the
Environmental Protection Agency plans to start digging up
lead-contaminated yards and carting in fresh soil this summer.
   Boosters say Kellogg's greatest cause for hope is the unflagging
determination of its residents.
   Several hundred of them attended a recent ground-breaking
ceremony for the gondola. Dignitaries on a crepe paper-covered
stage spoke of Kellogg's bright future, of hard work paying off.
The high school band played the ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' and
the crowd cheered as fireworks exploded over a nearby slag heap.
   ``Kellogg has a long way to go,'' said Bill Scudder, chamber of
commerce president. ``But you've really got to admire this
community. It has never said die.''

   Kazuo Okuyama began his career with typical
Japanese movie fare: gangster and cute animal movies.
   Now the ambitious young producer hopes to inspire jaded Japanese
with the tragedy of an idealistic rebellion in 1936 which tried to
install a military government under the late Emperor Hirohito.
   Okayama's problem in making the film, due for release June 17,
has been that the attempted coup by 22 fervent young right-wing
military officers was quashed under orders of Hirohito himself, who
was then revered as a living god.
   The emperor isn't portrayed in the film, but his order against
the young rebels, whom Okuyama describes as martyrs, is depicted as
a misjudgment that ultimately led Japan into World War II, the
producer said.
   Reflections on the emperor's judgment and the question of his
responsibility for the war are acutely sensitive here, although
discussion of Hirohito's historical role has become freer since his
death Jan. 7 at age 87.
   Historians generally agree Hirohito was a figurehead, wielding
little real power. His most famous decision was Japan's World War
II surrender in 1945, when the government was deadlocked over the
issue.
   But Hirohito also ordered the 1936 leaders of the coup back to
their barracks after two days of assassinations and political
turmoil in the ``2-26 Incident,'' so called because it was launched
on Feb. 26.
   Several coup leaders committed suicide, and others were
imprisoned. On July 12, 1936, two civilians and 13 of the rebel
officers were executed by firing squad.
   Okuyama's movie, ``2-26'' tells the story of the young officers
who led about 1,500 soldiers and nine civilians in a bloody attempt
to overthrow the government and install a military regime under
Hirohito.
   The rebels claimed they sought to restore integrity to a nation
they believed was corrupted by a political elite living in luxury
while millions suffered Depression-era deprivation. Many of the
rebels, historians say, were sons of poor farm families who had
suffered hunger and seen their sisters sold into prostitution.
   But in the repressive atmosphere after the failed coup, an
opposing faction in the military used the incident to build its own
power, eventually establishing a militaristic regime that led Japan
into World War II.
   ``There was an energy and an intensity alive then that has been
forgotten in today's Japan,'' the 35-year-old producer said.
   ``One main reason I wanted to produce this film is because we
live in a similar era, when young women prostitute themselves and
revelations of political corruption surface every day,'' said
Okuyama. ``The only difference is that then we were poor and now
we're rich.''
   The film is coming out amid outrage over a scandal in which 14
prominent bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on
suspicion of bribery and other illegalities, and more than 150
people embarrassed by disclosures that they accepted unlisted
shares at discount prices from an employment information firm.
   ``I wanted to sound an alarm, to use the tragedy and drama of
the 2-26 incident to tell people what they don't want to hear about
political corruption and decay,'' Okuyama said.
   ``Influential people are gathering dirty money. Like the martyrs
of 2-26, people should care.''
   The film depicts the deaths of the coup leaders as a tragic loss
of courageous young men who died still true to their ideals.
   ``Even though the emperor doesn't understand that we were right,
history will answer for us,'' says one coup leader before putting a
bullet in his head.
   Okuyama said in an interview that he knew a decade ago that
there was material to make a good movie, but it just wasn't
possible because of a lack of funds, and sensitivities about the
emperor.
   The screenwriter didn't want to get involved, he said, but
``finally agreed on the condition we play down politics and aim the
movie more toward young people.''
   Corporate backers also feared a backlash from right-wing groups
that vociferously protest anything they interpret as disrespectful
toward the imperial family.
   ``When we get to the last print, just before distribution, we
plan to show the film to some of the major right-wing groups to try
to gain their understanding,'' Okuyama said.
   But he still expects some trouble. ``Actually, I'm very worried
just now, very afraid. But even if there's controversy, I think I
can explain what we're trying to do.''
   The film ends on a note the rightists should appreciate: a clash
of gongs and ``Tenno Heika Banzai,'' or ``Long Live the Emperor.''

   When Talking Heads rhythm section-spouses Chris
Frantz and Tina Weymouth decided it was time to delve back into
their roots, the place to begin was obvious: CBGBs.
   It was in the funky Manhattan club on the Bowery where the Heads
first surfaced as part of the burgeoning new-wave scene that
produced Blondie and the Ramones. And so the Tom Tom Club returned
to headline a three-week stand announcing their comeback after a
six-year absence.
   ``It was fun. We saw all the old people, you know? The old hard
core at CBGBs,'' said Weymouth, bass player with Talking Heads.
``We had a lot of technical problems, but it was great fun.
   ``We had people come up: Dee Dee Ramone, Jerry Harrison, Debbie
Harry, Lou Reed. People really appreciated it.''
   So did the Tom Tom Club, the non-Heads project of drummer Frantz
and bassist-vocalist Weymouth, husband and wife. They liked it so
much the band is currently doing a nationwide tour of clubs and
campuses, returning to the smaller venues where the Heads started
out in 1977.
   ``Chris and I were really in fear of leading insular lives. ...
It seemed important to get out of that ivory tower,'' Weymouth said
in a recent interview. ``We feared self-indulgence. ... We began to
go back to our roots.''
   The results are evident on ``Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom,'' the
current Tom Tom Club album featuring covers of Bob Dylan (``She
Belongs to Me'') and Lou Reed (``Femme Fatale'').
   ``The whole point being to try to find out what it was again
that had made us really keen and interested in music,'' said
Weymouth. ``And we wanted to stay well clear of what Talking Heads
were doing.''
   Touring, she said, will insure that. The Heads haven't toured
since some dates early in 1984; Tom Tom Club's summer tour of North
America will run through August.
   In addition to giving Frantz, Weymouth and bandmates Mark Roule
(guitar) and Gary Pozner (keyboards) a chance to perform live, it
will also give Talking Heads rhythm section a chance to do
something outside the constraints of their other band.
   ``Even though Talking Heads always tried to avoid the pitfalls
of being defined by our image, just the fact that we got successful
meant that it did kind of confine us to a certain set of
definables,'' said Weymouth.
   ``Although it's all of our band, very much from the point of
view of lyric-writing and melody it is very much a David Byrne
vehicle. Which is great, but we wanted to have it more open, so
it's not always going to be the same lead singer, the same
lyricist.''
   For their third album, Tom Tom Club also went for a different
sound than its earlier well-known dance hits ``Wordy Rappinghood,''
``Genius of Love'' or ``The Man With the 4-Way Hips.''
   Weymouth is resigned to the fact certain people won't like what
her band is doing these days _ and she means either Talking Heads
or Tom Tom Club.
   ``People who never liked Talking Heads as a three-piece resented
it when we added Jerry Harrison. And when we ceased to be a quartet
and came onstage with eight or nine people, the same thing
happened: `Oh, they were great back then,'' said Weymouth.
   The bassist sighed and shook her head.
   ``This is often the case. People who were not at all into rap
music and hip-hop in 1980 now remember `Genius of Love' and `Wordy
Rappinghood' _ `Oh, those were great cuts! Can't you do something
like that again?' And you just have to laugh.''

<HEAD>George Lucas Brings His Golden Touch to the Screen Once Again</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' opens May 24.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The beard is tinged with gray, but George
Lucas, whose trilogies of ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones'' have
written film history, still conveys the boyish wonder of the
movie-struck kid from Modesto.
   Lucas, who just turned 44, came to town from his Northern
California empire to do some interviews for ``Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade,'' which seems certain to restore the luster of his
golden touch. After a series of monumental hits, Lucas productions
turned sour with ``Labyrinth'' and ``Howard the Duck.''
   His $55 million ``Willow'' performed decently in this country
and impressively abroad, but critics complained that Lucas was
repeating himself. Lucas traditionally has paid little heed to
critics, pursuing his own course at the Lucasfilm headquarters
north of San Francisco.
   Director Steven Spielberg and star Harrison Ford have indicated
that ``The Last Crusade'' will be the last of the Indiana Jones
adventures. Does producer-storywriter Lucas believe it will be?
   ``Probably,'' he said. ``Unless I come up with some completely
inspired idea. Three, I think, is a pretty nice number.
   ``We originally thought about doing three of them. We wouldn't
have done the second one (`The Temple of Doom') unless we came up
with a story that we all thought was fantastic and really wanted to
do. We weren't really interested in making a film just to be making
a film.''
   ``The Last Crusade'' comes five years after ``The Temple of
Doom,'' which followed ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' by three years.
The longer gap, said Lucas, was due to failure to find a script the
three principals agreed on.
   ``I wanted to do a film about the Holy Grail; Steve thought it
was too abstract an idea,'' Lucas said. ``We developed a story on
another idea which didn't turn out. Menno Meyjes came in to do
another screenplay, and he didn't like that idea. We started
talking about the Grail and decided to try to sell Steven on it.
(The screenplay is credited to Jeffrey Boam.)
   ``One of the major mythological threads (of the Grail) is inner
happiness and fulfillment, which really deals with compassion and
caring about other people in relationships. In that, it's a natural
evolution to relationships with your parents.''
   That resulted in the role of the senior Jones for Sean Connery.
In his early thinking about Indiana Jones, Lucas had figured the
character had been raised by a father who was a teacher. But that
was as far as he had gone. The father role was written for an older
man _ ``a John Houseman type'' _ but Spielberg announced, ``I want
Sean Connery.''
   Lucas was reluctant at first, but he agreed after talking to the
Scottish actor about the script. The casting proved to be
``brilliant beyond our wildest imaginations,'' said the producer.
   There's nothing new to report on a resumption of the ``Star
Wars'' saga, originally planned as a triple trilogy by Lucas.
   ``It's still sitting on the shelf,'' he said. ``It'll be a few
years before I get back to it. That's the way those things work.
I've got to get motivated by ideas and themes and that sort of
thing before I can go back and do it. I've got a lot of other
things I'm more interested in at the moment.''
   One of them is a modern story, a small film for a change. He
plans to write the script whenever he can find the time, and _
surprise _ he would direct it himself. Hailed as a superior
director with ``American Graffiti,'' he has not directed a film
since the original ``Star Wars'' 11 years ago.
   Directing, he observed is ``a lot of fun and a lot of work. (As
producer) I get some of the fun without all the work. I've likened
the difference between producing and directing as the difference
between coaching and being the quarterback. There's a joy in both,
but they're two different jobs.
   ``I was a quarterback for a while, and I was a coach for a
while,'' Lucas said. ``I can go back to being a quarterback if the
situation seems right.''

<HEAD>Haitian Interdiction Program Stirs Controversy; Some Say It's Racist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRACY FIELDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city water tower was in sight, just above the
waves breaking on the Florida coast. To the 101 Haitian men, women
and children jammed into a ramshackle 50-foot boat, the tower
beckoned as if it were the Statue of Liberty.
   The group had sailed at least 500 miles, from hopelessness in
Haiti toward a vision of new lives in a prosperous land.
   But 1,000 yards before reaching the three-mile-wide ring of U.S.
territorial waters, that vision evaporated. A Coast Guard cutter
called ``Escape'' appeared, and the Haitians were taken aboard and
returned to their capital, Port-au-Prince.
   Had they gotten inside the territorial limit, the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service would have been obliged to
grant them asylum hearings.
   Few have come quite as close before being stopped by the
government's Haitian Interdiction Program, which critics say not
only dashes dreams but also discriminates against a predominantly
black nation.
   Supporters say the program protects Florida shores and cities
from being overwhelmed by illegal aliens who come here seeking jobs.
   In 1981, Haiti gave the United States permission to patrol the
waters off its shores, picking up the thousands who try to leave
the poorest country in the hemisphere each year.
   In those eight years, more than 20,000 people have been stopped
under the Haitian Interdiction Program.
   ``It's clear they're playing games with the black refugees,''
said Gerard Jean-Juste, director of Miami's Haitian Refugee Center.
   He believes the policy is intended to keep blacks from entering
the United States, while Latin refugees have been welcomed.
   In January, thousands of Central and South American ``bus
people'' streamed into Miami after a federal judge ruled they could
no longer be held near their points of entry in Texas.
   They were accommodated in a public stadium, opened to hold them
after the city determined that a private shelter was dangerously
overcrowded. Although the immigration status of many is uncertain,
they haven't been sent back to their homeland.
   During violent Miami racial disturbances in January, some black
leaders said perceived racism in the treatment of Haitians and
Latin aliens was among the sparks to violence.
   Immigration officials deny the interdictions are racially biased.
   ``If we could prevent the people in Central America and South
America from reaching our borders we would do that,'' said Verne
Jervis, assistant director of public affairs for INS in Washington.
``It's a different situation.''
   Haiti is the only country with which the United States has such
an arrangement, INS officials say.
   But Miami INS district director Perry Rivkind said it makes
sense.
   ``There is no choice whatsoever,'' he said. ``That is the
heaviest movement to the United States in this hemisphere.''
   The Coast Guard says approximately 1,300 people were picked up
at sea in March alone, more than in the first two years of the
program combined.
   Several factors help explain the increase.
   At the time of the March wave, a rumor was circulating that the
U.S. government had relaxed its immigration policy.
   Another factor has been political instability in Haiti. A series
of coups and coup attempts followed the overthrow of the Duvalier
family dictatorship three years ago.
   The business and economic achievements of many Haitian-Americans
also are a lure, Rivkind said.
   ``You now have a Haitian community that's very successful,'' he
said, pointing out that Haitians own numerous thriving businesses
in South Florida.
   He described the wave of Haitian would-be immigrants as a
standard immigration trend, where those left behind in the homeland
follow the pioneers who came to America and made good.
   ``The difference is, the others generally came legally,'' he
said, referring to European immigrants who arrived earlier this
century and were abosorbed into the American melting pot.
   As for the Haitians, he said, ``I think the whole island would
be here if it could.''
   Rivkind is concerned about the implications of the situation,
which has spurred angry protests by Miami Haitian advocates and
simmering tensions at a detention center on the edge of the
Everglades. On May 11, Rivkind said immigration officers headed off
a riot plot by seizing homemade weapons and placing 700
undocumented aliens, most of them Haitians, under lockdown.
   ``The tension from it isn't very conducive to good will,''
Rivkind said.
   Jean-Juste agreed.
   ``I hear Haitians yelling `Long live Castro ... U.S. is racist
... they don't like black,' '' he said.
   Jervis explained that U.S. immigration law works best for people
who have a well-founded fear of their governments, who have family
here and who have job skills that will sell in the United States.
   ``The problem is that many people from Third World or developing
countries ... those people don't fit either one of those categories
and they don't have relatives here, so they're not eligible to
enter,'' he said.
   The way Haitians try to escape their homeland indicates how bad
things are there.
   The Coast Guard usually discovers them crammed aboard homemade
open sailboats with a cooking area but no toilets, Petty Officer
Luis Diaz said. The situation of those who suffered the near-miss
in March is typical.
   ``You come in, you say, `Thanks, God,' but I don't know how many
of my brothers and sisters got killed in the sea water,'' said a
Haitian who asked to be called ``Timmy.'' He came by boat in 1980.
   Interdictions are hard on the men and women of the Coast Guard,
whose job forces them to deal firsthand with the Haitians'
desperation.
   ``We've got to look at it in a positive way,'' said Diaz. ``Many
may make it, but many may not. At least we're trying to save their
lives.''
   In April, the Coast Guard doubled its interdiction patrols,
stationing vessels hundreds of miles southeast of Florida to reduce
the time and effort involved, according to Jeff Karonis, spokesman
for the seventh Coast Guard district.
   But that cuts resources devoted to another mission. ``The
increase in patrols is all coming out of vessels assigned to drug
operations,'' Karonis said.
   ``Our flexibility is greatly reduced and that's just one more
thing we have to deal with down here.''

   The Democratic-controlled Congress gave final
approval to legislation raising the minimum wage for the first time
in eight years, but President Bush said it was ``inevitable'' he
would kill the measure with the first veto of his administration.
   The vote Wednesday was 63-37 to approve the plan, which would
boost the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991.
That vote left supporters shy of the 67 needed in the Senate to
override Bush's veto.
   Majority Democrats are short of a two-thirds override margin in
the House, which passed the bill earlier this month, but sponsors
have promised a veto override attempt nonetheless.

   Speculators sold McGraw-Hill Inc. stock after
the company announced a standstill agreement barring British
publisher Robert Maxwell from attempting to take over the company
for 15 years.
   The pact with Maxwell Communications Corp. was part of a joint
educational publishing venture between Maxwell affiliate Macmillan
Inc. and McGraw-Hill announced Wednesday.
   McGraw-Hill fell $5.75 a share to $69 in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading Wednesday.
   ``The market is saying it is a less likely takeover candidate
because Mr. Maxwell has been an active buyer of media properties,''
said analyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
   But he added: ``Maxwell's one player in the universe. It seems
to me the stock is way overreacting.''
   Analysts said the selloff was led by speculators abandoning
McGraw-Hill because of the reduced likelihood that the company,
which has been considered a weak performer in recent years, would
be acquired.
   They speculated that Maxwell proposed the standstill to allay
fears he would go after new partner McGraw-Hill, considered a
takeover target for some time.
   Macmillan spokesman David Adler declined to say whether Maxwell
had made buyout overtures toward McGraw-Hill, the New York-based
publishing and information services company.
   Maxwell, one of the world's 10 biggest communications,
information and publishing groups, owns no stock in McGraw-Hill,
Adler said.
   ``Maxwell Communications offered to enter into the standstill
agreement and McGraw-Hill accepted,'' McGraw-Hill spokeswoman Betsy
Russo said. ``We have nothing more to say than that.''
   The joint venture in elementary, secondary and vocational
education publishing combines units of Macmillan and McGraw-Hill
that had $440 million in total sales last year.
   London-based Maxwell last year acquired New York-based Macmillan
for $2.5 billion after a bitter takeover battle.
   ``The combination of Macmillan's educational business with that
of McGraw-Hill is a dramatic illustration of the high quality of
the publishing businesses we acquired in Macmillan,'' Robert
Maxwell said in a statement.
   The publishing venture will create a new Chicago-based company,
Macmillan-McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., equally owned by
McGraw-Hill and Macmillan.
   McGraw-Hill units that will enter the venture are its School
Division, Gregg Division, CTB-McGraw Hill and Educational
Resources. The units accounted for about 9 percent of McGraw-Hill's
total 1988 revenue, or about $165 million. Operating profits of the
divisions was $8.5 million.
   Macmillan units in the deal are its School Division, Glencoe
Division and Barnell Loft operations. McGraw-Hill will buy Maxwell
Communications' Science Research Associates and London House for
$190 million and place them in the new company.
   The Macmillan units last year had combined revenue of about $275
million, or about 20 percent of Macmillan's total revenue.
Operating profits totaled about $40 million.
   ``This restructuring of our elementary and high school units
into an independent entity fits nicely with our strategy to develop
core businesses with significant market share,'' McGraw-Hill
Chairman Joseph L. Dionne said.
   Analysts said the deal would catapult the new company to among
the top four elementary and high school publishers.
   ``McGraw-Hill has not been a power in the elementary and high
school side. ... They definitely take a step up in the ranks,''
Appert said. ``It's going to help McGraw-Hill's profit quite a
bit.''
   McGraw-Hill, which also owns Business Week magazine, four
television stations and the Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating
service, earned $185.5 million last year on revenue of $1.8
billion. Maxwell Communications reported $230.5 million in 1988
profit on sales of $1.9 billion.

<HEAD>Avon Board Rejects Amway Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miffed at what it called an ``hysterical'' and
``irresponsible'' rejection of its $2.1 billion takeover bid, Amway
Corp. withdrew its offer to acquire rival Avon Products Inc.
   The move came late Wednesday, just hours after Avon's board
rejected Amway's $39-a-share offer saying that uniting the nation's
two biggest companies in person-to-person sales would cause a
culture clash with disastrous consequences.
   The board's rejection of Amway's bid had been expected, given
previous statements from Avon that the company was not for sale.
   Avon's stock had edged down 12{ cents a share to close at
$40.12{ in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. Amway,
which had sought a friendly deal and had indicated it would be
willing to increase its offer, withdrew after the market closed.
   In a letter to Amway, a privately held direct-selling concern
based in Ada, Mich., Avon Chairman James E. Preston said the board
reviewed the acquisition proposal thoroughly before voting
unanimously to turn it down.
   ``We are convinced that our shareholders' long-term interests
will best be served by Avon remaining independent,'' Preston said
in the letter released from the company's New York headquarters.
   Avon's shares are undervalued and don't reflect the company's
improved prospects, Preston said, noting ``we are confident that
the long-term value of the Avon common stock is significantly
higher than $39 per share.''
   Avon lost $404.5 million in 1988 on revenue of $3.06 billion.
The loss came as Avon continued the process of divesting its
operations in the health-care services field so it can focus its
efforts on enhancing its beauty and direct-selling businesses.
   Preston said Avon's management ``is turning the company around''
so ``from a shareholder perspective, now would be the worst time to
sell the company.''
   The lengthy letter sent on behalf of the Avon board contained a
litany of reasons why Avon objects to Amway's interest. One of the
key objections was that there would be dangerous friction in trying
to meld the two companies.
   ``Combining our cultures would be disastrous to our business,''
the letter said. ``It would create hostility within the sales force
and would destroy Avon's good name.''
   In response, Amway characterized Avon's rejection letter as
``hysterical, irresponsible and irrelevant'' as well as ``vicious
and irrational.'' It described Avon's charges as ``baseless,
reckless and defamatory.''
   Amway said it doesn't intend to pursue a bid as long as Avon's
board ``maintains its current hostile position that the company is
not for sale under any circumstances.''
   Analysts and investors believed Amway's offer was too low, and
some valued Avon as high as $45 a share. Amway may have
intentionally made a ``low-ball'' offer in the likelihood that no
other competitive bids would surface, they said.
   Avon said it conducted a survey this week in which almost half
of its top-selling sales representatives responded that they would
quit rather than be associated with Amway. Nearly 40 percent of the
representatives in the United States said they would probably
leave, also.
   Avon has about 425,000 sales representatives in the United
States and another 1 million agents marketing Avon products in more
than 80 foreign countries.
   Avon had planned to mail letters to shareholders today providing
details of its plans. Avon spokesman John Cox said shareholders
would be told the basis for the board's decision, not information
about anti-takeover tactics.

   Eastern Airlines boss Frank Lorenzo has accused
the carrier's striking unions of brainwashing members and has asked
psychiatrists to study the materials sent by strike leaders to the
rank and file.
   In a speech last Friday to students at Stanford University's
business school, Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air
Corp., said the psychiatrists met in Washington to examine the
union literature.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said the company had no immediate
comment on Lorenzo's remarks. An account of Lorenzo's speech in
Palo Alto, Calif., was released by the business school.
   ``We have people here (in the unions) who have been totally,
completely brainwashed,'' said Lorenzo, as quoted by the Stanford
press release.
   ``We have, in fact, a meeting going on today in Washington,
D.C., by a bunch of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who are going
through the propaganda materials that these people are being sent.
And this is brainwashing in the style of the '40s.
   ``What is being put into their heads gets them excited about
giving up their jobs and giving up their careers.''
   It was unclear from Lorenzo's remarks whether he had hired the
psychiatrists. It also was unclear how he intended to use their
analysis of the union materials.
   Dan Ashby, a spokesman in New York for the Eastern pilots union,
on Wednesday called Lorenzo's remarks ``a continuation of his
desperation tactics.''
   ``We would suggest that Mr. Lorenzo sit down with these people
(the psychiatrists) and find out what his own problems are,'' he
said. ``We're very sane people; we're very serious about what we're
doing.''
   Since March 4, pilots and flight attendants at Miami-based
Eastern have supported a strike by the airline's Machinists union.
Lorenzo put Eastern into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March
9.
   Protestors threw eggs in Lorenzo's direction before he entered
the auditorium to make his one-hour speech, and called him
``Hitler'' and ``greedy bastard'' when he left, the business
school's news release said. It also said the 200 or so protestors
included pilots and machinists at Eastern.

   A federal jury has rejected a woman's claims that
G.D. Searle &amp; Co.'s Cu-7 birth control device caused her
infertility, marking the company's 15th victory of 19 cases that
have been decided in court.
   The jury in U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel's court concluded
Wednesday that the Cu-7 device was not responsible for any alleged
injury of the plaintiff, Cindy Nickerson. The jury also found in
favor of the other defendant, Ortho Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer
of the Lippes Loop intrauterine contraceptive.
   ``We are pleased that the Massachusetts jury was persuaded by
the weight of science, the long history of safety and
effectiveness, of the Cu-7 and the continuing endorsement of the
product by the medical community,'' said William I. Greener Jr.,
Searle spokesman.
   So far, 19 such cases have gone to a judge or jury, said Searle
spokeswoman Kay Bruno.
   ``We've won 15 of the 19. Of the four losses, two are completed
cases and two are on appeal,'' she said. ``Unfortunately, there are
still cases pending against the company.''
   Although most of the cases thus far have favored Searle, the
company was ordered last year to pay damages to a Minnesota woman
in the amount of $8.75 million, which was later reduced by a judge
to $8.15 million.
   Ms. Nickerson's attorney, Anil Madan, said an appeal is being
considered. She criticized defense attorneys' conduct.
   ``We felt that the defendants, particularly Searle, made the
plaintiff a victim and paraded her sexual and personal history
before the jury,'' Madan said.
   Searle maintains that its product is safe when used properly.
   ``The product is still approved by the FDA as safe and effective
when used by its label.'' Bruno said. ``While we have not been in
the IUD market for three years now, we have said that we would
vigorously defend this product.''
   Three years ago, Searle discontinued its IUD business in the
United States citing difficulty in getting product liability
insurance and the cost of defending against suits.
   Searle, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Monsanto Co., is a
research-based company that develops, manufactures and markets
prescription phamarceuticals.

   Eastern Airlines' proposed plan to rebuild as a
smaller carrier and sell $1.8 billion in assets could gain critical
support at a meeting today of the committee representing its major
creditors.
   The creditor panel's financial advisers, investment firm
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and accountants Ernst &amp; Whinney, have
concluded that Eastern's restructuring plan may be feasible and are
expected to present that view to the committee, sources close to
the situation said Wednesday.
   That would add to the building momentum in favor of the
strikebound carrier's proposed plan, as prospects for a sale of
Eastern as a whole appear to dim, some observers and sources said.
   Court officials have labeled as inadequate the buyout proposals
submitted so far by two investor groups; a federal bankruptcy judge
has approved the idea of selling the airline's prized Northeast
shuttle, and Eastern has moved further along with its own plan to
sell assets and reorganize as a smaller carrier.
   The judge on Wednesday gave Eastern permission to lease 14
Boeing 727-200s to Pan American World Airways for $57.9 million
over three years as part of its restructuring plan. Eastern had
signed a tentative agreement with Pan Am to lease the jets for
$96.6 million over five years. Eastern has announced similar
agreements with other carriers in recent weeks, but the Pan Am deal
was the first approved by the bankruptcy court.
   Some union representatives admitted privately that the recent
developments were a setback for the unions because of the
likelihood the airline would be broken up _ something the unions
have opposed strongly.
   ``They (Eastern) seem to sort of win by default,'' said one
union operative who asked not to be named.
   ``The longer it drags on, the less value Eastern brings to a
buyer,'' said Paul Karos, an airline analyst for First Boston Corp.
``Something has to happen very quickly.''
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a paralyzing
strike by its Machinists union that was supported by pilots and
flight attendants. The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of
Eastern or any of its assets, including the shuttle service.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner for Eastern, said
at a bankruptcy hearing Tuesday there were no ``real live offers''
to buy the entire carrier and challenged suitors who have made
proposals to risk at least $100 million of their own cash for any
purchase.
   Two investor groups, one headed by Chicago commodities trader
Joseph Ritchie and the other headed by former Piedmont Airlines
chairman William Howard, have submitted formal bids. In response to
Shapiro's request, the Ritchie group said it planned to revise its
proposal with a new plan that would include ``substantial equity
capital.''
   Also on Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland said
Eastern had provided valid reasons for its plan to sell the New
York-Washington-Boston shuttle. Eastern already has an agreement to
sell the shuttle to developer Donald Trump for $365 million, but
Lifland gave the airline until Monday to consider a higher bid by
America West Airlines.
   Joel Zweibel, the attorney representing Eastern's major
creditors, said they supported a prompt sale of the shuttle.
   The growing likelihood of a shuttle sale, coupled with the
apparent lack of credible buyout offers for the whole airline,
bolster Eastern's proposed plan to cut its size and sell another
$1.4 billion or so in assets separately, some observers say.
   Eastern's unions tried to put a good face on the developments.
   Shapiro's statements on the inadequacy of the offers are ``a
blessing in disguise'' because they will draw out improved bids
from the suitors and speed up the process of reviving Eastern,
pilots union spokesman Dan Ashby said Wednesday in New York.
   However, some union sources suggested privately that a sale of
the shuttle, which long has been vigorously opposed by the unions,
could crush their morale and may even prompt Eastern pilots to
return to work.
   Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. had no comment on the matter,
spokesman Art Kent said.
   Phoenix-based America West has offered to pay $415 million for
the shuttle and $336 million for 10 Boeing 757s in a total package
worth $751 million.
   Trump's $365 million agreement with Texas Air Chairman Frank
Lorenzo expires on May 27. Under their contract, the developer
would receive $8 million from Eastern if the shuttle deal collapses.
   America West has said it would not employ Eastern employees if
it purchased the shuttle, while Trump has recognized the Eastern
unions for his shuttle.

   Some consumer advocates say an Agriculture
Department plan to speed up federal inspection at major cattle
slaughter plants is enough ``to ruin your summer barbecue.''
   But a meat industry official says the criticism is
sensationalism and irresponsible.
   A coalition of consumer and labor organizations was adamant,
however, in calling on USDA to withdraw the proposal and redesign
it with the views of consumer and public health groups in mind.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
also have been asked to support the move to have USDA recall the
proposal, the consumer advocates told a news conference Wednesday.
   The proposal was announced Dec. 1. An extended period for public
comment ended this week, but no final decision is expected by USDA
for some weeks or months.
   Under the department's ``streamlined inspection system'' for
cattle, called SIS by the bureaucracy, federal inspectors at 40 or
50 of the largest slaughter plants would turn over some of their
responsibilities to company employees.
   The idea is to let inspectors concentrate on checking for
abcesses, tumors and other abnormalities in the heads and innards
of slaughtered cattle instead of spending so much time on seeing
that that workers keep hair, mud, excreta and other contaminants
from beef headed for consumers.
   One result would be to speed up the lines of carcasses moving
along the inspection route. As this is done, inspectors would have
less time to do their jobs.
   Manly Molpus, president of the industry-supported American Meat
Institute, said his organization has repeatedly urged that USDA not
put the new system into effect ``until it is reviewed by an
objective third party panel of scientific experts'' to ensure that
meat safety would not be diminished.
   Molpus said in a statement that attempts to use
``sensationalistic meat safety tactics'' to discourage
modernization of the federal meat inspection system, which dates
back to 1906, are irresponsible.
   ``Mud-slinging through the media does nothing to further a
reasoned debate on how to modernize the inspection system,'' he
said.
   But Carol Tucker Foreman, who oversaw federal meat inspection
while an assistant secretary of agriculture in the Carter
administration, told reporters the USDA proposal would define clean
beef as the ``average quality of product produced'' by the
slaughter plants.
   In other words, she said, whatever is produced becomes the norm
_ the average, or ``aesthetically acceptable'' product that meets
the interpretation of federal standards.
   Foreman said the proposal, if implemented, would ``shift
responsibility for food safety away from federal inspectors sworn
to uphold the law and protect the public health to plant management
whose first concern is profit.''
   Moreover, she said, the plan would allow increases in speed of
carcass lines, which would push up already high injury rates in the
meatpacking industry.
   Foreman said it also could lead to higher beef prices for
consumers because only the 40 or 50 largest packing companies would
use the new streamlined procedures, giving them a competitive
advantage.
   Department officials say the 40 or 50 largest plants account for
about 80 percent of the nation's beef output. In all, there are
approximately 1,700 federally inspected slaughter plants that
handle cattle.
   ``USDA is out to ruin your summer barbecue,'' Ms. Foreman said
in a statement. ``Beef is a favorite food of the American people,
especially during the summer cookout season which we are fast
approaching. Unfortunately, the USDA has proposed regulations that
will call into question the safety and wholesomeness of beef
stamped USDA approved.''
   Steven D. Chockerham, a USDA meat inspector who works at a
Montfort Inc. plant in Grand Island, Neb., said the plan _ which
has been tested at the Grand Island plant and in several other
locations _ is based on ``statistics, averages and odds'' in hopes
that contamination rates will be kept in bounds.
   But Chockerham, a member of the American Federation of
Government employees and a whistle-blower working with Government
Accountability Project, one of the consumer groups in the
coalition, said he has seen evidence to the contrary.
   Chockerham said he kept an informal, unofficial ``but accurate''
record of slaughtered cattle heads coming across his inspection
station and found that 24 percent were contaminated, including
hair, hide and stomach contents. The contamination rate under the
old procedures was about 3 percent, he said.
   Linda Golodner, executive director of the National Consumers
League, said the streamlined system would demean the traditional
USDA stamp of approval on beef.

<HEAD>Yeutter Urged to Allow Grazing on Conservation Land in Drought Areas</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter is being
urged to think hard about opening up millions of acres of long-term
conservation land to haying and grazing in drought-stricken areas.
   Yeutter is under pressure from Capitol Hill and other quarters
to approve haying, grazing or both on highly erodible land taken
from crop production under the Conservation Reserve Program.
   But Kenneth A. Cook, vice president for policy at the Center for
Resource Economics, and Justin R. Ward, senior project associate of
the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Wednesday it is
premature to open up the CRP as a source of livestock feed.
   In the 1988 drought, the Agriculture Department approved haying
on millions of acres of CRP land in dozens of states. But none has
been approved for haying or grazing in 1989.
   Cook and Ward said in a letter to Yeutter that several major
farming areas face the possibility of a second consecutive year of
severe drought.
   ``It is early in the growing season and the threat will not
materialize if moisture-deficient areas in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska
and other states receive the amount of rainfall the National
Weather Service has recently forecast,'' the letter said.
   It is understandable, Cook and Ward said, that many farmers,
particularly livestock producers, are extremely anxious at this
time.
   But they told Yeutter: ``We urge you to proceed with
deliberation and caution in any decision to open the CRP. The
public has already invested billions of dollars in the CRP and will
invest billions more in the years ahead.''
   Such investment, Yeutter was told, could be compromised if USDA
does not establish ``clear, consistent criteria and procedures''
for deciding on the emergency use of CRP lands.
   More than 28 million acres have been set aside under the CRP and
is supposed to remain out of production for 10 years. The contracts
specify that protective grass and trees must be planted to project
the fragile soil from wind and water erosion.
   In return, farmers get initial financial help from USDA to plant
the grass and trees. Each year they get federal rental payments,
averaging around $50 per acre. These currently cost about $1.5
billion a year.
   ``Any decision to open the CRP in selected counties will result
in requests and increased pressure for similar treatment of
additional counties,'' Cook and Ward said. ``And since drought
afflicts some part of the country every year, it is safe to assume
that you will face similar decisions about the CRP year in and year
out.''
   They added: ``This year and in future years, we urge you to
establish a formal, public procedure for making determinations
about emergency use of the CRP. We feel this procedure should
include consultation with farm, environmental and wildlife
interests, and between USDA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.''

   The latest survey by the Agriculture
Department shows that prospects for summer water supplies in much
of the West have declined from last month because of below-average
precipitation and early snowmelt.
   ``Warm temperatures and sunny skies throughout the West in April
caused snowpack to melt sooner than usual for the month,'' Wilson
Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation Service, said
Wednesday.
   April precipitation was below average or well below average
throughout the region except in the Pacific Northwest and Montana,
he said. Consequently, seasonal forecasts have been reduced in most
basin areas.
   ``Early runoff improved reservoir storage dramatically,''
Scaling said. ``However, inflows have already begun to taper off in
many basins.''
   April precipitation was less than 50 percent of average in the
Southwest, except for pockets of above average precipitation in
southern Arizona, southeastern New Mexico and central Colorado.
   Streamflow forecasts have been reduced throughout the West
through September, Scaling said. However, near-average flows are
expected for most rivers in Oregon, as well as for the Upper
Columbia, the Upper Snake and along the mainstem of the Yellowstone
River.
   Nevada is the only state where reservoir storage is well below
average, he said. Summer inflows to reservoirs are likely to be
below average in all Western states.
   The West depends on snowmelt for about 75 percent of its water
supply.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of May 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.85 million head,
up 4 percent from a year ago and 8 percent more than inventories of
two years ago, says the Agriculture Department.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.53 million head, up 1 percent from a year
ago but down 9 percent from two years ago, the department said
Wednesday.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in April totaled 1.57 million head,
down 2 percent from a year ago but up 2 percent from two years ago.
   As of May 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year earlier
in Colorado, Kansas and Texas, but were less in Arizona,
California, Iowa and Nebraska. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of May 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Mexico Announces $1.96 Billion Loan Package with World Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank will loan Mexico, the
developing world's second-largest debtor, nearly $2 billion to fund
two hydroelectric projects and help reduce its interest payments,
the government has announced.
   The announcement by Finance Minister Pedro Aspe on Wednesday
came the same day Mexico resumed negotations in New York with a
15-member committee representing creditor banks and two days after
the government liberalized its foreign investment rules.
   The new loan package ``will support structural changes
undertaken by the federal government in the financial, industrial,
commercial and state-run sectors,'' Aspe said.
   ``One portion of the resources will be utilized for debt
reduction, serving as an important advance in the process of
renegotiation with foreign creditors,'' Aspe said without
elaboration.
   Only Brazil at $118 billion has a higher foreign debt among the
developing countries than Mexico, which owes creditors $107.4
billion.
   Aspe said the money could be available ``almost immediately''
once the World Bank directors approve the package, and would be
directed toward developing hydroelectric projects and debt
reduction. He did not allow reporters to ask questions.
   Aspe said only that the loan would fund a government
hydroelectric project in the western state of Nayarit and in the
central state of Hidalgo.
   ``The loan recognizes the achievements in stabilizing the
economy and control of inflation ... and the fundamental objectives
of Mexico's economic program for 1989-94,'' the minister said.
   Consumer prices in Mexico rose 159 percent in 1987, a record
high, then slowed to 52 percent last year.
   ``The loan supporting the state-run sector recognizes the
advances the federal government has undertaken to make state-owned
companies more efficient and rationalize subsidies,'' Aspe said.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has pledged to sell off some
money-losing state companies, long protected by his predecessors,
cut inflation and modernize the economy.
   On Monday, Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche announced new
foreign investment regulations that open some sectors of the
economy sheltered by years of protectionism and increase the amount
of foreign ownership allowed in others.
   The new rules open up previously closed areas such as auto
parts, telecommunications, fishing and petrochemicals production to
a maximum of 49 percent foreign investment.
   Other industries Mexico deems ``strategic'' such as banking,
petroleum, mineral exploration, transportation and broadcasting
will remain off-limits for foreign investors.
   Also Wednesday, an official of the International Monetary Fund
was quoted as saying that international lending organizations and
private banks could allow a 20 percent reduction in Mexico's debt
service.
   The state-run Notimex news agency quoted Eduardo Borenstein as
saying that debt reduction would be the inevitable result of
negotiations between debtors and creditors.

<HEAD>DOT Raises Concerns About American, Delta CRS Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed combination of the computer
reservations systems of two of the nation's major airlines is
troublesome, but could produce more competition if properly
structured, the Department of Transportation says.
   In a letter, and accompanying summary, to Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner raises
concerns about the proposed merger of the CRS operations of
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   But Skinner says assurances that the new partnership would be
operated separately and would not favor either carrier could remedy
his department's concerns about the deal.
   Both American and Delta said Wednesday they viewed the letter as
a favorable development.
   ``We have said from the beginning that we wanted other
partners,'' said Bill Berry, spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta.
``We are talking to several foreign and domestic carriers who want
to buy as little as 1 percent and as much at 10 percent.''
   ``It won't even be like a subsidiary,'' said John Hotard, a
spokesman for Fort Worth-based American. ``It will be keeping an
arm's length from each of the other owners,'' and make marketing
decisions on its own.
   ``The proposed transaction now before you has the potential to
adversely affect competition in the CRS industry and the airline
industry,'' Skinner said in his letter, dated Monday.
   ``The merger could combine the largest and smallest of the five
firms in the CRS industry, which are controlled by two of the
largest and most successful members of the airline industry.
   ``While we do not believe that competition in the CRS market is
threatened so seriously that the transaction should be challenged
on that basis, we do believe that the transaction as currently
structured poses a substantial likelihood of producing an adverse
effect on airline competition'' by being used as an unfair
marketing weapon for American and Delta, the nation's number one
and number three carriers respectively, Skinner said.
   ``Thus we believe the transaction should be challenged unless it
is modified to include at least one additional airline owner, and
to assure separate management and marketing'' of the surviving
system.
   In a summary of its findings, however, DOT says, ``With adequate
assurances that (the new company) will be controlled and operated
in a `carrier-neutral' manner ... the transaction could actually
benefit airline competition if it makes the largest U.S. CRS a
truly neutral distribution tool.''
   American and Delta announced the joint partnership in February.
Under the deal, Delta would pay American $650 million and they each
would own half of the resulting company.
   Initially, the airlines said they would sell up to half of their
shares in the partnership for $20 million for each percentage
point. Three months later, they cut the price to $15 million for
the first 20 percent to spur interest in gaining another partner.
   Under the still-unnamed partnership, American's SABRE system
would eventually absorb Delta's DATASII system, an acknowledged
weak point of the airline.
   Computer reservations systems are used by travel agents to book
airline tickets. SABRE has been the industry leader, but also has
been the target in the past of government complaints that it
unfairly favored American flights.
   American subsequently changed the program to answer those
complaints and now operates as a ``neutral, unbiased CRS that sells
a whole assortment of travel products,'' Hotard said.
   The Justice Department is expected to decide by early June
whether it will challenge the merger on antitrust grounds.

<HEAD>Comptroller Moves to Kick Blinder, Robinson Out of Florida</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. Inc. has been accused by
Florida officials of scheming to defraud its customers, and the
comptroller moved to stop the company from doing any business in
the state.
   Florida Comptroller Gerald Lewis announced Wednesday that the
Denver-based company, with offices nationwide, was ordered to
immediately stop its alleged violations of Florida securities laws.
   Blinder, Robinson could lose its Florida license and faces more
than $5 million in fines as a result of the state's 2{-year
investigation into alleged market manipulation of penny stocks.
   Lewis charged that the firm, licensed in Florida since 1973,
made millions of dollars in illegal profits by inflating the
purchase price of certain stocks beyond the legal limit, conducting
excessive stock trades just to earn commissions and buying and
selling stock without clients' permission.
   Penny stocks are low-priced, thinly traded securities that
generally cost less than $5 per share and are traded over the
counter.
   In a statement issued Wednesday, company officials said Blinder,
Robinson was in full compliance with Florida law and would
vigorously defend itself against the charges.
   Rick Rouse, director of compliance for Blinder, Robinson, said
the Florida Department of Banking and Finance had acted
irresponsibly in its action.
   ``Whenever there have been problems, we have addressed them. I
cannot rationalize how the department could neglect to ask for our
cooperation before instituting such an action,'' he said. ``We
intend ... to pursue all appropriate recourse.''
   The Florida action cited numerous infractions of state
securities laws, including sale of unregistered securities,
unreasonable markups, failure to maintain proper records,
unauthorized trading and scheming to defraud.
   It also named 29 former and current employees, including the
company's president, Meyer Blinder, and vice president Larry
Blinder, his son.
   The case has been turned over to the statewide prosecutor's
office for possible criminal prosecution, Lewis said.
   Blinder, Robinson has 21 days to ask for a hearing to stop its
Florida license from being revoked, which would prohibit the
company from conducting any securities business in Florida. The
firm has 10 branch offices and 423 agents in Florida.
   ``The history of their company is one of litigation,'' Lewis
told a news conference in Miami. ``We're ready for battle.''
   The firm has been under investigation in other states and by
federal authorities. State securities officials say thousands of
investors in Florida may have been victims of Blinder, Robinson's
practices.
   An example of the firm's alleged market manipulation involved
the sale of shares of Onnix Financial Group Inc., Lewis said. In
addition to selling the original shares at up to a 112 percent
markup, Blinder, Robinson allegedly sold nearly 42,000 nonexistent
shares, he said.
   The company's troubles with the Securities and Exchange
Commission date to 1980, and include a massive probe initiated by
the SEC in April 1987 into allegations that it defrauded customers.
   The SEC has been investigating allegations stretching back to
August 1983 that Blinder, Robinson violated federal law by
marketing nine distributions of unregistered securities, by falsely
representing the business prospects of the companies involved, and
by excessively marking up the prices of the securities.
   The SEC had two other actions pending against the company for
alleged bookkeeping violations.
   Company attorneys have contended that the government had a
vendetta against the firm. Blinder said negative publicity
devastated business in 1988.

   Men too embarrassed to discuss hair loss
in person will be able to gain information by telephone through a
toll-free service offered by Upjohn Co., maker of the baldness drug
Rogaine.
   Upjohn will run a series of television and print advertisements
beginning this week urging men concerned about hair loss to see
their physicians.
   A call to the toll-free telephone number will give a consumer
more information about male pattern baldness, treatment options and
physicians in the caller's area.
   The campaign replaces advertising showing a man walking on a
beach talking about male pattern baldness. The current ad and the
new one, with a man looking into a mirror, are prohibited by law
from mentioning the name of the prescription drug.
   Upjohn, which received federal approval to market Rogaine in
August 1988, has refused to talk about sales of the drug.
   Ronald Nordmann, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., estimated
that domestic sales of the drug accounted for about $11 million of
the $755 million the company reported in revenues for the first
three months of this year.

<HEAD>State To Investigate Price Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Office of Energy Resources will
investigate why wholesale gasoline prices rose 22 cents a gallon
from March 10 to April 21.
   Energy Secretary Sharon Pollard said among the issues to be
examined is whether the oil industry is exploiting the March 24
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
   ``The goal of this investigation will be to get to the bottom of
this issue and determine whether the oil companies are just lining
their pockets or whether these increased prices are justified,''
Pollard said.
   ``Consumers are outraged, and we intend to give them some
answers,'' she said.
   Prices at the pump have increased 9 to 15 cents per gallon,
indicating some of the wholesale price increases have been absorbed
by the companies and not passed on to consumers.
   Oil company executives and some independent energy analysts said
the Valdez spill had little or nothing to do with the price
increase.
   ``I don't think you'll find that more than 5 percent of the
increase was related to the Valdez accident,'' Henry Lee, director
of Harvard's Energy and Environmental Policy Center and former head
of the state Energy Office, told The Boston Globe.
   ``Companies seized the opportunity to raise prices faster and
higher than they would have, and it made a huge financial impact,''
said Edwin Rothschild, a consumer activist who organized a
nationwide boycott of Exxon.
   ``They probably would have tried to pass those increases through
gradually, but this was sudden and extreme.''
   Lee said one factor in increased prices was the loss of 420,000
barrels of oil a day because an oil platform in the North Sea
broke. ``That has panicked all the gasoline refiners in Europe,''
from which Northeast states get a lot of their fuel, he said.
   Frank Tivnan, director of the Massachusetts Petroleum Council,
which represents gasoline refiners and sellers, said investigations
in Massachusetts and New York should prove that policies of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, air pollution
regulations, increased demand, and expensive changes at European
refineries led to the price increases.
   He said the OPEC price increase accounts for 8 to 9 percent of
the retail price increase.
   The demand by Northeast states for gasoline that is slower to
evaporate, and so will cut summer emissions of dangerous organic
compounds, makes fuel ``more difficult to get and more expensive,''
Tivnan said.
   He said oil executives and a study by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency said prices would rise because of the new
gasoline.
   ``If the Valdez had any effect on oil prices, it was simply a
psychological effect on the West Coast for a few days or week,''
Tivnan said. ``After a week or so, tanker traffic returned to
normal.''

   Three days after blueberries are plucked from
the bushes in Bacon County, clerks place them on shelves in West
German supermarkets so winter-weary shoppers can satisfy their
craving for fresh fruit.
   Last year south Georgia growers exported 105,000 pounds of
rabbiteyes _ native blueberries bred from wild plants. The 1988
crop totaled 5.2 million pounds and was valued at about $4 million.
   This year growers are shipping Southern highbush varieties such
as Georgia Gems, an early ripening berry that goes to market about
two weeks ahead of rabbiteyes when prices are highest. Freezing
temperatures last winter has cut this year's crop roughly in half,
but export efforts continue.
   A few hours after harvesting, the berries are packed in plastic
baskets and trucked to Jacksonville, Fla., for a flight to
Frankfurt.
   ``There's a demand for fresh blueberries in that part of the
world. We're trying to cash in on it,'' said Danny Stanaland, the
county extension agent in Alma, an agricultural community of about
5,000 that bills itself as the ``Blueberry Capital of Georgia.''
   Georgia's blueberry industry has been growing since the early
1970s when farmers began experimenting with the fruit as an
alternative crop.
   While tobacco is still the top cash crop in the area, Stanaland
said blueberries have gained in importance. ``Corn and soybeans
wouldn't pay the bills, but fortunately we have blueberries to pick
up the slack,'' he said.
   Currently about 3,000 acres are devoted to blueberries.
   Trade experts point to blueberry exports as an example of new
business opportunities for south Georgia, a rural region plagued by
poverty and high infant mortality. The area has been described as
``the other Georgia'' because it has lagged behind Atlanta in
sophistication and economic growth.
   ``The world is growing smaller, and even an area like south
Georgia can be involved in international trade if you have the
right product,'' said horticulturist Gerard Krewer, a fruit
specialist with the Georgia Extension Service.
   Athens, Ga., economist Keith Scearce said forestry and farming
can provide many export opportunities, but businesses will have to
make a special effort to develop new markets.
   ``You've got to get people thinking bigger than they have in the
past,'' said Scearce.
   Shipping blueberries to Germany would have seemed like an
impossible task a decade ago, but now it's viewed as a growing
opportunity for farmers.
   Stanaland said local officials are seeking federal funds to
improve Alma's airport, and growers are considering the possibility
of using the community's 5,000-foot runway to ship their berries
directly to Germany.
   ``We would like to say that one day we can pick our berries and
take them to our local airport,'' he said. ``That way we might be
able to pick them today and sell them tomorrow, wherever there is a
demand.
   ``We know we have something good,'' he said. ``We hope the world
likes it.''

<HEAD>Group Linked with Rothschild and Goldmsith Agree to Buy Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunningdale Holdings Ltd., a group linked with
British investors Jacob Rothschild and James Goldsmith, said
Thursday it has agreed to buy a 29.9 percent stake in Britain's
Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC currently held by Goodman Fielder Wattie
Ltd. of Australia.
   Sunningdale said it agreed to buy the stake at 400 pence, or
$6.48, a share, contingent on the failure of a current takeover bid
by Ranks Hovis for Goodman Fielder. If the bid succeeds,
Sunningdale will be entitled to a payment of 50 pence, 81 cents, a
share.
   Last month, Ranks Hovis, a baking and foods concern, offered the
equivalent of about $2.1 billion for Goodman Fielder, the biggest
food processor in Australia and New Zealand.
   The bid represented a turnaround in a longstanding battle which
last year saw the Australasian group's $2.8 billion takeover bid
for Ranks Hovis thwarted by a British government investigation into
its impact on competition in the foods sector.
   The entry of Sunningdale to the fray represents the first joint
investment venture by Goldsmith and Rothschild since the pair
announced plans to create Anglo Leasing PLC in March. Anglo Leasing
is to be owned equally by Goldsmith and Rothschild companies, which
also have holdings in Sunningdale.
   Rothschild and Goldsmith have said the aim of their new company
would be to acquire one or more large publicly quoted British
companies which could benefit from restructuring.
   Goodman Fielder, which has been seeking a buyer for its 29.9
percent stake in Ranks Hovis since its bid for the British foods
group lapsed last August, stands to make a windfall gain on the
sale.
   In its recent talks with Ranks Hovis, Goodman Fielder has
indicated it might be willing to proceed with a merger, but only on
its own terms. It has rejected the initial Goodman Fielder offer,
saying it doesn't adequately reflect the value of the company.
   Ranks Hovis, which currently holds a 14.9 percent stake in
Goodman Fielder, said the sale breached one of the conditions of
the bid, adding that it was still considering what actions to
pursue.

   The stock market turned downward today following
a government report on inflation that was slightly worse than
expected.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.95 to 2,457.48
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 331 up, 551 down and
498 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.7 percent in April, bringing the increase in the index so far in
1989 to an annual rate of 6.6 percent.
   The monthly number came in near the high end of advance
estimates on Wall Street, and apparently disappointed some traders
who had been hoping for a pleasant surprise in the data.
   Still, analysts noted that much of the increase came, as
expected, from a jump in energy prices that is not expected to be
repeated in coming months.
   That left the door open for stock-market bulls who contend that
the Federal Reserve has a good chance of succeeding in its effort
to restrain inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down { at 49\;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down [ at 34{; Eastman Kodak, down
[ at 43], and International Business Machines, down } at 110}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .37 to 176.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .28 at 351.56.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.98 to
2,462.43.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 958 up, 505 down and 508 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 191.21 million shares, against 173.10

<HEAD>Dollar Surges on Inflation Report</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with dollar rising against some currencies after central
bank intervention.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surge in U.S. consumer prices sent the dollar
sharply higher in Europe today despite a coordinated move by
central banks to reverse the currency's advance.
   Gold was slightly higher.
   The U.S. Labor Department said an all-time record increase in
gasoline prices fueled a large, 0.7 percent jump in consumer
inflation in April. The spurt in the Consumer Price Index followed
advances of 0.5 percent in March and 0.4 percent in February.
   The dollar jumped after the announcement as traders anticipated
the U.S. Federal Reserve would further tighten credit in an attempt
to choke off inflation.
   The U.S. currency rose against the West German mark and the
Swiss and French francs after the banks' concerted intervention. It
fell against the Japanese yen and the British pound.
   The central banks of France, Italy, Austria and Switzerland
confirmed that they sold dollars, primarily against West German
marks, and some confirmed it was a concerted effort aimed at
pushing the dollar lower.
   The Bank of England also participated, dealers said. Other
participants reportedly included the Federal Reserve and the West
German Bundesbank.
   In London, the British pound cost $1.6170 at midmorning,
compared with $1.6140 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates at midafternoon, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.9690 West German marks, up from
1.9675; 1.7600 Swiss francs, up from 1.7580; 6.6675 French francs,
up from 6.6607; 2.2183 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2150; 1,435.50
Italian lire, up from 1,433.00; and 1.1930 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1925.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose for the sixth consecutive trading day, closing at
an 18-month high of 138.88 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at
138.93.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $371.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $370.75. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $371.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $371.00, up from $370.25 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.01 to close at a bid $371.73.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.43 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $5.46.

   When Roseanne Barr sizes up a stack of bills
swamping her television-show husband she tells him: ``Pay the ones
marked `final notice' and throw the rest out.''
   The advice from the ABC comedy star on a recent episode was
meant as a joke, but many real-life bill payers sometimes do just
that, unaware they could possibly create a black-mark on their
credit rating, that mysterious dossier used by everyone from banks
to employers to decide whether you're responsible.
   While most people know a file on them exists somewhere they're
not sure exactly who keeps it, what's in it or how to track it down.
   ``It's a real web,'' said Robert Morton, head of the United
Consumer Credit Alliance, a Miami-based consulting group. ``A lot
of people are confused.''
   Credit files exist on nearly all adult Americans and are kept
primarily by four large private credit bureaus with offices
nationwide. These bureaus get their information from lenders, and,
in turn, sell it to creditors evaluating consumer-loan applications.
   Each file contains three types of information: personal data,
such as a social security number and address; record of payment;
and legal records, such as court judgments involvings debts or
insolvency.
   ``Your credit file will reveal whether you have paid your bills
on time ... if collection agencies were hired to dun you, or if
you've gone through bankruptcy,'' Bankcard Holders of America, a
consumer group based in Herndon, Va., states in a pamphlet it
publishes on understanding credit bureaus.
   What the credit file usually won't include is salary
information, late payments within a 60-day grace period, or records
on utility bills, said Mike Van Buskirk, a vice president for TRW
Information Systems Group, which runs the nation's largest credit
bureau.
   ``It's a little like a library, only it has the unusual problem
of not having direct ability to validate the information,'' Van
Buskirk said. ``If there's an error in the file most people won't
find out about it until they've suffered a damage or
embarrassment.''
   Consumer fear of reputation-tainting information in a credit
file, especially at crucial times such as when applying for a
mortgage, has helped TRW sell its ``Credentials'' service to nearly
750,000 subscribers across the country.
   Lately, the company has been advertising heavily, with ``Mission
Impossible'' star Peter Graves as spokesman in TV ads, in large
markets such as New York.
   For a $35 annual fee Credentials offers consumers unlimited
access to their files, notification whenever someone checks on
them, the release of credit data to authorized lenders and a
credit-card registration service to protect against theft or loss.
In the process, TRW also collects extra financial information that
may not included in the files it already has.
   While some people describe the service as a convenience, others
call it a slick gimmick, since all consumers are entitled under law
to a copy of their credit file from a bureau for free or a nominal
fee.
   Consumers also are entitled to receive from any credit bureau
the identities of those who have sought their file, although in
most cases they'll already know an inquiry is imminent since
federal law strictly limits access to credit files to anyone other
than lenders to whom you've applied for credit.
   ``If you're a busy executive and you're buying a home, a boat, a
car and applying for a person loan all in one year, Credentials
would be a good deal,'' said Elgie Holstein, executive director of
Bankcard Holders of America. ``(But) it's unlikely most consumers
would have the need to apply for major credit loans enough times in
the course of the year to make this worthwhile.''
   Morton agreed, ``It's a service that's little, if any, value for
the consumer but a high value for TRW. Consumers are paying to give
TRW more information.''
   Morton recommends that average consumers check their credit
report for accuracy at least once a year.
   To do that consumers must write to a major credit bureau in
their area, which may be appear under ``credit bureaus or
credit-reporting agencies'' in the telephone directory. Besides TRW
the big bureaus are Trans Union Credit Information, CSC Credit
Services Inc. and Credit Bureau Inc. CSC and CBI recently agreed to
merge their data services, although they operate separately.

<HEAD>With BC-Credit Watching</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fair Credit Reporting Act, enacted in 1971, gives Americans
the right to know what's in their credit file and to challenge
whatever information they believe to be inaccurate.
   If you're denied credit, you're entitled to know what's in your
file within 30 days of receiving a rejection letter. That notice
will contain the name and location of the credit-reporting bureau
contacted in evaluating your file.
   At any other time, you can write to or visit the credit bureau
to inspect your file for a nominal fee, usually between $5 and $10.
The FCRA requires the bureau to help you if there's something in
your file you don't understand.
   The FCRA also allows access to your credit file by those
authorized in writing, such as lenders to whom you are applying for
credit, potential employers or insurers. Every time someone
requests a copy of your report, it's noted as an ``inquiry'' on
your credit file.
   You can dispute information in your file by providing evidence
to prove an error or by insisting on an investigation.
   You can also submit statements to your file explaining why
negative credit remarks were accumulated. Negative information can
remain on your report for up to seven years, while bankruptcies are
reported for 10 years.

<HEAD>Corn and Soybean Prices Rise on Forecasts of More Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn and soybean prices rose in the wake of the six- to 10-day
forecast released Wednesday by the National Weather Service. It
calls for below-normal rain and above-normal temperatures in much
of the Corn Belt.
   Prices also were helped by the belief that corn and soybeans
have been oversold in recent sessions.
   There are too many uncertainties in the weather this time of
year, says Jon Horton, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago.
   ``Everyone remembers the drought last year,'' he said. ``Without
perfect growing conditions, prices at these levels aren't
justified.''
   Wheat prices dropped as traders noted there hadn't been much
export of the grain recently. However, there has been good
commerical buying, spurred by the Agriculture Department's
announcement yesterday that the export bonus program would continue
as long as other nations subsidize their grain sales.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.09 a bushel; corn was a {
cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $2.78 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with May at $1.83{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with May at $7.31 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed and meat prices lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .45 cent lower to .12 cent higher with June at
71.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .53 cent higher
with May at 77.45 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .25 cent
lower with June at 48.17 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.32 cent lower to .13 cent higher with May at 35.80 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled lower Wednesday, while pork prices
were higher.

   The federal government will require automakers to
boost their fleets' average fuel economy for 1990 cars, a move
praised by a consumer advocate as a ``clear break'' from the Reagan
administration.
   An analyst, however, said the plan will have a minimal effect on
U.S. gasoline consumption, and General Motors Corp. said it could
result in job cuts.
   Manufacturers must improve overall fuel economy by 1 mile per
gallon over 1989 models, to 27.5 mpg, Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner announced Wednesday.
   ``I'm hopeful this will be an incentive to (carmakers) to
explore better ways to develop better engines and get better
mileage,'' Skinner told reporters.
   ``We've got to get beyond where we are today, in miles per
gallon, if we're going to deal with this energy crisis.''
   Skinner said the United States is importing more than 8 million
barrels of oil a day for the first time since the 1970s.
   Congress in 1975 gave the Transportation Department authority to
set the fuel economy standards for passenger cars sold in the
United States. The standard, known as the corporate average fuel
economy, is measured over an automaker's entire fleet.
   ``The energy problem is such that every bit helps,'' said Con
Hitchcock, a lawyer for Public Citizen, a Washington, D.C.-based
consumer group founded by Ralph Nader. ``The automobile is the
single largest user of petroleum and any saving will be helpful.''
   Hitchcock, noting that the U.S. government had lowered the
standard to 26 mpg for 1986-88 models, lauded the higher standard.
   ``It is a clear break with the Reagan administration policy,''
he said. ``This is a sign that the Bush administration is more
concerned about energy and the environment than its predecessor
was.''
   But David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office
of Study of Auto Transportation, said the new standard will not
make much of a difference in overall U.S. fuel consumption, or have
a big effect on car prices.
   ``From a consumer's standpoint, it's probably not going to make
that much difference,'' Cole said in a telephone interview. ``In
terms of the industry meeting the 27.5, it's real do-able because
they're real close already.''
   William Noack, a GM spokesman in Washington, said the new
standard could endanger U.S. jobs by restricting the number of
family-size American-made cars.
   ``Today, Americans want larger, family-size vehicles, and if we
are restrained from competing with foreign manufacturers for those
sales, the effect will be a loss of American jobs and no energy
savings for the country,'' Noack said.
   Though foreign-made cars sold in the United States are governed
by the standard, most foreign manufacturers have built up credits
under the program by marketing highly fuel-efficient cars in past
years and can now sell bigger cars without penalty, he said.
   Hitchcock said the car companies ``have been making that same
tired argument since 1974 without it really coming true.''
   ``There's no evidence we've seen that (the standard) has driven
prices of U.S. cars up,'' he said.
   Spokesmen for all three U.S. automakers said the companies would
comply with the standard.
   Skinner, in Chicago as part of National Transportation Week
observances, said he could not estimate how much fuel will be saved
under the new rules.

   David S. Ruder is resigning as chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to return to the faculty of the
Northwestern University School of Law, the agency announced today.
   In a letter to President Bush, Ruder said he plans to return to
Northwestern at the end of August. The date of his resignation will
depend on the timing of the selection of a successor.
   Ruder assured the president that he will continue to perform his
duties actively until his return to Northwestern and will work with
the administration to secure a smooth transition.
   Ruder, a nominee of former President Reagan, was appointed to
the commission in August 1987 for a five-year term.
   There had been widespread speculation that Ruder would be
replaced by the Bush administration and a search already was under
way for a successor.
   Among the names that have been mentioned as possible successors
to Ruder are John M. Richman, chairman of Kraft Inc. of Chicago;
John J. Creedon, president of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.;
Harvey L. Pitt, of Fried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobsen in
Washington; Thomas A. Russo, former director of the trading and
markets division at the Commodity Futures Trading Comission; and
SEC Commissioner Edward H. Fleischman.
   Other changes also are considered likely in the make-up of the
five-member commission.
   Under Ruder's command, the SEC conducted a massive investigtion
into insider trading on Wall Street. The investigation, which was
launched under Ruder's predecessor John Shad, resulted in charges
against a string of financiers including speculator Ivan Boesky,
junk bond wizard Michael Milken and Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   In his letter to Bush, dated Wednesday, Ruder said he thought it
was crucial that the commission have ``vigorous and strong
leadership.''
   ``The chairman of the SEC should have the capacity to manage the
commission well, to deal effectively with Congress, the
administration, other administrative agencies, and the securities
industry and to understand the complicated statutes administered by
the commission,'' he wrote.
   Ruder said he planned to resume teaching law in the 1989-90
academic year.
   It was the second big resignation announcement at the SEC within
a week. SEC Enforcement Director Gary G. Lynch last week announced
he would resign in mid-July to seek other job opportunities.
   Lynch, who had led the insider trading probe, said his decision
to leave was influenced in part by the fact that his cases had been
concluded or had reached a point where he could leave without
jeopardizing them.
   Ruder, 60, proved himself a skilled administrator from 1977 to
1985 as dean of Northwestern's law school, where he helped organize
two annual institutes for corporate and securities lawyers.
   Ruder, described by associates as a moderately liberal
Republican, had never held a previous government position, but had
taught courses in SEC enforcement, insider trading and tender
offers, and had written more than 40 articles on corporate
securities matters.
   He also practiced law for four years at Quarles &amp; Brady and five
years at Schiff, Hardin &amp; Waite, a prestigious Chicago firm with a
Washington branch.
   Born in Wausau, Wis., Ruder graduated with honors from Williams
College in Williamstown, Mass., in 1951, and received his law
degree with honors from the University of Wisconsin in 1957.
   He was an associate at Quarles &amp; Brady from 1957 to 1961 before
accepting a faculty position at Northwestern.

<HEAD>Official Says U.S. Trade Retaliation Could Cause Strong Reaction
In Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan may react strongly if the U.S. government
lists it among countries deemed to seriously violate free trade
principles, a Foreign Ministry official said Thursday.
   Under U.S. trade law, the Bush administration must decide by May
30 which countries maintain high trade barriers to U.S. products.
Japan topped a preliminary list, released last month by U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, of 34 countries deemed to have such
barriers.
   ``This is a matter that has already created quite a reaction in
this country,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told a
regular press briefing.
   If Japan is listed as a serious free trade violator, he said,
``The reaction could be rather emotional.''
   The New York Times reported from Washington earlier this week
that the American Embassy in Tokyo had recommended that the U.S.
government use restraint in pressuring Japan to eliminate trade
barriers.
   It quoted secret embassy cables as warning there might be ``an
emotional outburst in Japan'' if the country is included in the
list of most serious free trade violators.
   Many Japanese feel their country has done a great deal in recent
years to open its markets to foreign products and that the United
States has not tried hard enough to sell high-quality products in
Japan or to reduce its massive government budget deficit.
   Some Japanese officials also were embittered by the U.S.
handling of a recent agreement to jointly produce Japan's next jet
fighter. U.S. congressmen demanded a renegotiation of the pact and
contended Japan was using it to acquire U.S. technology, even
though Japan had hoped to develop the plane alone.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said Japan might retaliate if the
United States violated international trade regulations in
attempting to reduce its trade imbalance with Japan.
   ``If there is any action taken on the part of the United States
in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, we have
to think of what we should do'' in response, Watanabe said.
   According to figures released Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce
Department, Japan accounted for 67 percent of the U.S. trade
deficit in March, up from 53 percent in February. Many observers
say Japan is likely to be included in the ``hit list'' of serious
free-trade violators because of its large portion of the trade
deficit.
   Other Asian nations, including South Korea and Taiwan, were
included in the preliminary listing of alleged unfair traders and
have been lobbying in Washington to avoid being included in the
upcoming list. Workers and farmers in South Korea have demonstrated
against the U.S. trade pressure.
   Under U.S. trade law, nations on the final list will be targeted
for intensive negotiations aimed at removal of alleged trade
barriers. If the barriers continue, the law provides for
retaliation, including duties of up to 100 percent on imports from
those nations.
   Watanabe said all of the charges against Japan in the Trade
Representative's report were ``based on erroneous understandings or
simply not based on facts.''
   He said the United States would realize ``there is no foundation
for putting those items as candidates on the list'' if it
investigates the charges further.
   U.S. officials acknowledge that Japan has one of the lowest
average tariff rates in the world, but say cultural and other
factors make it difficult to sell here.
   Last year, the United States had a $52 billion trade deficit
with Japan, according to U.S. figures.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will acquire Thrifty
Rent-A-Car System Inc. for $263 million under an agreement
announced today by Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca.
   Iacocca told stockholders at the nation's No. 3 automaker's
annual meeting here Chrysler would pay $27.75 a share in a tender
offer for the Tulsa-based rental company.
   With its planned purchase, Chrysler was joining other automakers
_ including General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. _ that have
acquired ownership of or stakes in car rental firms.
   ``Thrifty is a solid player in the car rental business and in
our dealing with Thrifty in the past six years we have been
impressed with the strength of the company and its management,''
Iacocca said.
   ``That played a key role in our decision to take this step in
what is a natural alliance cementing a good relationship.'' he said.
   Thrifty, with more than 650 locations worldwide and an average
fleet size of more than 33,000 vehicles, is the fifth-largest auto
rental company in North America.
   Thrifty's revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, was
$79.3 million. The company earned $9.1 million.
   ``We are delighted by the prospect of joining forces with
Chrysler,'' said Thrifty Chairman William E. Lobeck Jr. ``Our board
of directors recommends unanimously that stockholders tender their
shares.
   ``With Chrysler's resources behind us in the future, we can
expect additional growth for the company.''
   Iacocca said Thrifty's management would remain in place and
continue operations from Tulsa.
   The tender offer will be subject to various government
approvals. The transaction will be managed by Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.
   Ford, the nation's No. 2 automaker, holds 55 percent of the
stock of Hertz Corp., the nation's largest automobile renter. In a
deal announced earlier this month with Volvo North American Corp.,
Volvo acquired a portion of Ford's equity which would reduce Ford's
ownership to 49 percent of the Hertz stock.
   Last October, Ford agreed to provide $324 million in financing
for the acquisition of Budget Rent a Car Corp. by Beech Holdings
Corp. That deal went through in March.
   Ford's equity in that deal involved nonvoting preferred shares.
   GM acquired a minority interest last October in National Car
Rental. Between the mid-1920s and 1953, GM held an interest in a
Hertz predecessor company. GM, larger than Ford or Chrysler, has
declined to reveal the amount of that interest or its cost.

<TEXT>
   Reality is elusive in economics, where fads come
and go, where strawmen are created so they can be cut down and
where myths sometimes serve as well as facts, especially in popular
interpretations.
   It is a myth, for example, that Japan is the biggest investor in
the United States and it will remain a myth until Japan overtakes
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. And by then it could be
overtaken by Canada.
   Myths persist for many reasons, one being that myths lend
themselves to dramatic tales. And, because they have at least the
ring of truth, some vested interests seize them and use them for
their private propoganda purposes.
   But no, the Japanese aren't the biggest buyers of U.S. assets.
It might appear to be so because they increased their direct
investments sharply, from $4.7 billion in 1980 to $33.4 billion in
1987.
   With less public concern, however, Europeans and Canadians have
long invested heavily in the United States. In 1987, the United
Kingdom owned $74.9 billion of U.S. assets, the Netherlands $47
billion and Canada $21.7 billion.
   Why the concern about the Japanese? The speed, perhaps. But the
increase in Japanese investments may not be maintained. Do you
recall in the 1970s when the oil-rich Arabs were said to be buying
up America?
   It is because of such misconceptions that the Washington-based
Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation has issued another in its
series of myth booklets, this one written by its own economist
Michael Becker, a doctoral student.
   Recognizing the low level of economic literacy, the foundation
states its position clearly: It is, it says, a nonpartisan research
and education organization. Its goal is to educate policymakers,
the media and citizens.
   Among myths it seeks to disprove is the one about foreigners
buying up America. Well, they are, you say. Well, they're not, says
Becker. The fact, he says, is that foreign-owned assets are a very
small percentage of U.S. assets.
   Despite the recent influx of foreign capital, Becker claims that
foreign investors own only 4 percent to 5 percent of U.S. physical
assets.
   Well, you say, they've been snapping up American farmland. And
if they're getting our farmland ,then they're increasing their
control over our food prices. And food makes up a very large part
of our consumer price index.
   No, says Becker, they are not snapping up farmland. It's a myth,
he says. ``They own negligible amounts of farmland,'' by his
estimates less than 1 percent.
   The confusion, he suggests, might arise from the nomenclature,
because timber land is sometimes classified as farmland. It isn't,
of course, but mythologists sometimes fail to observe such
distinctions.
   As a result, Becker points out, Maine, the Pine Tree state, has
the highest percentage _ 7 percent _ of foreign-owned
``agricultural'' land. Maine, says Becker, is ``hardly located in
the breadbasket of America.''
   Becker also tackles the notion that the United States is the
world's largest ``debtor nation.'' A red light flashes before his
eyes. Why, he says, it isn't even clear that the United States is a
debtor nation at all.
   He doesn't denounce the notion altogether, but he does offer
this explanation, among others, for his doubts:
   _The Commerce Department values direct investments at the
amounts paid at purchase. These amounts are not updated to account
for growth or inflation. Many U.S. investements abroad we made way
back in the 1950s and 1960s.
   _Foreign investments in the United States are of more recent
vintage. Their dollar figures are more likely to reflect current
values.
   While Commerce Department figures on direct investments and
stocks show the United States was a net debtor by $54.9 billion in
1986, Becker reminds us that market conditions have pushed up U.S.
assets abroad.
   He asserts that by adjusting the figures to 1986 market value
the United States was actually a net creditor by $296 billion.

<HEAD>Senate Set to Grant Final OK to $1.17 Trillion Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House broke a partisan gridlock today and
approved a measure providing $1.2 billion for veterans' benefits,
money that lawmakers felt they had to provide with the approach of
the Memorial Day recess.
   The legislation was approved on a voice vote following hours of
conferences among congressional leaders. Final legislative approval
by the Senate was possible later in the day.
   The veterans' funds, to be spent in the current fiscal year, had
been part of a larger measure that had become bogged down because
of a fight over $822 million it contained for anti-drug programs.
Democrats argued the money was needed for one of the nation's worst
problems, but Republicans insisted the extra money could wait until
next year.
   Late Wednesday, it appeared that the dispute over the drug
financing had ended all hopes of finishing work on the bill until
the Memorial Day recess ends on May 31.
   But both parties finally agreed to break the veterans' funds out
of the bill and leave the rest of it for the future. Memorial Day
recess _ when lawmakers traditionally give speeches to veterans'
groups _ begins this weekend for the Senate and next week for the
House.
   ``We do realize other things are controversial,'' said Rep.
Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee.
   Meanwhile, Senate approval was all that was needed for final
adoption of a $1.17 trillion federal budget for 1990 whose
defenders point not to what it does now, but to what it avoids and
what it portends.
   The House passed the spending plan on Wednesday by a 241-185
margin, with a majority of Democrats and Republicans voting in
support. The Senate planned to approve the measure today.
   The bipartisan endorsement was predictable because the package
reflects a $28 billion deficit-reduction deal the Bush
administration and congressional leaders reached last month.
   But though support was wide, it was not deep. Critics have said
the budget's claim to cut the deficit to $99.7 billion is based on
rosy economic assumptions that make the shortfall appear less
serious, gimmicks like moving the money-losing Postal Service ``off
budget,'' and one-time infusions of money from auctioning federal
loan portfolios.
   One lawmaker, Rep. Frederick Upton, R-Mich., referred to the
plan as a ``silhouette in silliness.''
   But defenders argued that the package avoids legislative
gridlock between President Bush and his ``no new taxes'' pledge and
the Democrats who control Congress and their reluctance to slash
domestic programs.
   They also said it lays groundwork for legislative-executive
cooperation for fiscal 1991, when the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law requires a shortfall of no more than $64
billion.
   ``The choice here is whether we take a first step or no step at
all,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   On the spending side, the plan bolsters domestic spending at the
expense of the Pentagon. Defense spending would increase to $299.2
billion, $4.2 billion short of what would be needed to counter the
costs of inflation.
   Domestic programs, as a whole, would be allowed to grow by about
$4 billion above the rate of inflation.
   Education, space, science, law enforcement, health and
low-income assistance programs would be given enough money to
expand over last year. Growth would be restrained for energy,
environment, transportation, agriculture and commerce initiatives.
   Foreign aid programs would reach $16.7 billion, enough to hold
even with inflation.
   The package assumes federal military and civilian workers would
receive 3.6 percent pay raises. Annual cost-of-living increases for
recipients of Social Security and other income-support programs
would be granted in full.
   To find savings, the plan would pare Medicare growth by $2.3
billion, an amount expected to come from reducing payments to
hospitals and doctors. Changes worth $1.1 billion would have to be
made in federal pension programs, and a change in the way the
Department of Veterans Affairs sells housing loans would raise $496
million.
   Credit would be taken for $850 million in savings by shifting
some agriculture payments from 1990 to this year. And $477 million
would be saved by taking credit for unused food stamps.
   Many of the savings called for in the plan are likely to trigger
congressional battles over the coming months. For example, the
budget calls for $5.3 billion in new tax receipts, but the nature
of those levies is expected to prompt prolonged fencing between
Bush and the Democrats in Congress.
   The budget says the government would pocket $5.7 billion by
selling assets such as loan portfolios and $2.7 billion by raising
fees for certain federal services. But, again, lawmakers must yet
thrash out which assets and fees would be affected and there is a
chance that stalemate would mean the savings would not occur.
   The budget does not require the president's signature. Congress
uses it as a guide when passing future spending and taxing bills
for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

<HEAD>The Housing Barometer and Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When housing starts begin to fall recession
fears rise.
   The relationship might be less now than it used to be, but a
decline in housing has preceded and accompanied most recessions in
recent years. And that makes housing a very sensitive economic
barometer.
   There are good reasons for following that barometer because, as
housing people point out, the building of just one single-family
house generates 1.8 worker-years of employment in construction or
construction-related industries.
   Understandably, houses are built by crews rather than 1.8
workers, but it averages out to that. Stated a bit differently, one
house provides 1.8 jobs of 40 hours a week for one full year and
two-thirds of another year.
   The National Association of Home Builders, which makes that
estimate from government figures, strives to show that housing is
good not only for them but good for the country, not only good for
builders but for other trades, too.
   Working from official government figures, the NAHB estimates
that 1,000 single-family homes generate $39.3 million in wages and
$16.1 million in combined federal, state and local taxes.
   Those amounts are just for single-family houses. Add in
multi-family housing and the impact of 1,000 units comes to 882
worker-years, $19 million in wages and $7.8 million in combined
federal, state and local revenues.
   When you consider that there are more than a million housing
starts each year _ more than 2 million in 1978 and probably 1.4
million this year _ the impact grows to enormous proportions.
   From 1983 through 1987, home builders say they built 8.6 million
units, creating 2.5 million full-time jobs and generating $55
billion in wages each year and a five-year total of $113 billion in
tax revenues.
   The impact even goes further. Who needs to be reminded that when
a house is purchased a series of big-ticket items are sure to
follow, including furniture, appliances, fuel contracts, lawn
mowers and more?
   No wonder that housing construction is an economic barometer; no
wonder that when the barometer falls it sends a warning about the
economy's direction as surely as its meteorological counterpart
signals inclement weather.
   Housing construction has fallen for three straight months,
enough to spur members of the NAHB to pay a visit this week to Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Their message:
Ease up.
   What builders fear, and many professional economists too, is
that any further increase in interest rates could pitch the economy
into a recession before the year is out. Heed our barometer, they
said.
   Conceivably, Greenspan already had taken notice. After about 14
months of fighting inflation via higher interest rates, the Fed
seems to have let up, if only for an assessment. In fact, home
mortgage rates have been falling.
   A decline in mortgage rates, coming as it does at the height of
the buying season, could pump some energy into the industry,
especially into the single-family home market. That market already
has shown renewed signs of life.
   It is the multimarket category of housing that shows the
greatest weakness, and that weakness is generally attributed to the
elimination or reduction of tax incentives, such as accelerated
depreciation.
   Recession? The housing barometer hasn't yet made that
declaration.
   What is has indicated is that some stormy weather lurks not far
away, and that we should be mindful lest it come our way. Another
monthly decline in housing, the barometer says, and it might.

   Demonstrators assembled peacefully today
at Exxon Corp.'s annual shareholders meeting, carrying protest
signs and accusing the company of lying about its disastrous
Alaskan oil spill.
   More than three dozen police officers watched as about 250
demonstrators lined the entranceway to the Aspen Manor Hotel in
this suburban community 35 miles west of Exxon's corporate
headquarters in New York City.
   Speaker Barry Commoner, a former presidential candidate and
long-time ecologist, said the spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound points out the United States' overreliance on fossil fuels.
   ``We are here to pass judgment on a crime against nature and the
American people,'' Commoner told the crowd. ``That is the only
adequate description for what Exxon has done in Alaska.''
   Consumer activists and leaders of national and state
environmental groups also planned to address the crowd, which
assembled peacefully outside the hotel and displayed signs that
read ``Overthrow Exxon'' and ``Clean up your entire mess'' as
stockholders arrived.
   Isabel Byrd of Trenton was dressed in an overstuffed tuxedo,
wore a pig's nose and walked on stilts. She identified herself as a
``pig from Exxon,'' and said her outfit represented the company's
corporate mentality.
   ``We just came to say we don't have to care, because we're
Exxon,'' said Ms. Byrd. ``We're greedy and we're pigs.''
   Steve Kosnac of Somerville said he had worked on laying Alaska
pipeline during the 1970s. He accused Exxon of deliberately
spilling the oil that poured from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez
on March 24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound, saying that spoiling
the area's coastline would render it useless for anything but oil
exploration.
   ``Oil companies are oil companies,'' Kosnac said. ``They're big
money and they'd walk through your property and just fight you in
court at a later date.''
   Weldon Monsport of Boonton carried a sign that said, ``Exxon PR
Is More Viscous Goo On The Truth.'' He said he blamed Exxon, the
people of Alaska who ``bought the safety of oil exploration hook,
line and sinker'' and the federal government for the pollution
along the Alaskan coastline.
   ``Exxon has lied from the start and the government has dragged
their feet and knuckles,'' said Monsport.

   Company documents describe the former
captain of the Exxon Valdez as an intelligent, skilled seaman who
failed to live up to his potential and suffered from depression and
alcoholism.
   The previously confidential documents were released Wednesday
during hearings into the March 24 tanker accident in which nearly
11 million gallons of crude oil spilled into Prince William Sound.
   The third days' testimony before a National Transportation
Safety Board panel opened today with Second Officer Lloyd LeCain
Jr., who was asleep when the wreck occurred. He was questioned
about the ship's navigational equipment.
   LeCain said the wheel would not change the ship's course if
turned while the vessel was on autopilot, and no alarm would sound.
   Third Mate Gregory Cousins, who was in charge on the bridge when
the tanker ran aground, had testified this week that he set off the
autopilot about 12 minutes before the wreck, but the ship did not
respond to his course changes.
   Earlier, during the second day of the five-day hearings, the
NTSB panel heard testimony that:
   _Capt. Joseph Hazelwood's blood-alcohol content may have been
more than five times the legal limit when the tanker ran aground,
and bottles of low-alcohol beer were found in his cabin shortly
after the accident.
   _The chief mate feared for his life when he discovered how much
oil was gushing into the water. He said Hazelwood told him, ``Well,
this is one way to end a career.''
   _Coast Guard radar failed to identify the tanker's position in
the minutes before the wreck, and may have been out of calibration.
   An Exxon Shipping Co. disability report dated May 14, 1985,
details the reasons for Hazelwood's admission to a hospital for
alcohol treatment. A doctor wrote that Hazelwood, then 38, had been
drinking excessively, causing problems at home and work.
   The doctor described Hazelwood as ``depressed and demoralized,''
and recommended a 28-day treatment program. The doctor concluded
that Hazelwood should take a leave of absense to get involved in
Alcoholics Anonymous.
   Work evaluations from 1982 to 1987 describe Hazelwood as getting
along well with his crew and meeting the ``normal requirements of
the position,'' but lacked creativitity or interest in running a
ship.
   ``Joe does not try to achieve the true potential his gifted
intelligence warrants,'' one supervisor wrote.
   Three of the four evaluations recommended at least temporary
shore assignment, but there's no indication company officials acted
upon the suggestions.
   The last evaluation, in 1987, said Hazelwood ``handles unusual
situations well'' and rated him above average on decision-making
ability. A 1984 report ranked him high on ``safety consciousness.''
   In testimony Wednesday, toxicologist Mike Peat said Hazelwood's
blood-alcohol level would have been 0.22 percent when the vessel
ran aground, assuming he did not drink any alcoholic beverage from
then until his blood was tested nearly 11 hours later.
   Peat, director of a Sacramento, Calif., laboratory that tested
Hazelwood's blood and urine samples, said the blood sample showed
an alcohol level of 0.061 percent.
   The Coast Guard considers commercial vessel operators illegally
intoxicated at 0.04 percent.
   Mark Delozier, chief warrant officer at the Coast Guard marine
safety office in Valdez, was the third witness to testify that he
had smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath.
   ``I would describe it as very intense,'' Delozier said. ``It
smelled like someone who had been sitting in a bar drinking for
quite some time.''
   Delozier and Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Falkenstein were among the first
officials to board the ship after it ran aground. Falkenstein also
said he smelled alcohol on the captain's breath.
   Delozier said Hazelwood tried to mask his breath by placing his
hand over his mouth, drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette, which
the Coast Guardsman asked him to extinguish because of the volatile
oil fumes.
   Like previous witnesses, Delozier and Falkenstein said Hazelwood
did not appear drunk. But Peat said that's not unusual for someone
with a history of alcoholism. Even at 0.22 percent, a person's
judgment and vision would be impaired regardless of physical
appearance, he said.
   Hazelwood has pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges of
operating a vessel while drunk and has declined to testify at the
NTSB hearings.
   The vessel's chief mate, James R. Kunkel, said he grabbed his
survival suit and thought he would die after the ship ran aground.
   ``I don't mind telling you that at the time, I knew that my
world would never be the same again,'' Kunkel said. ``I never knew
if I'd see my wife again.''
   He said he considered wearing a respirator after the odor of
crude oil filled the ship's passageways.
   ``I'm walking around wondering if I'm going to see the
sunrise,'' he recalled.
   The two ship traffic monitors testified that the Exxon Valdez
only showed up sporadically on radar after it left Valdez Narrows.
   Gordon Taylor testified that ships appeared and disappeared on
the radar, possibly because of a ``tuning problem'' with the
equipment.
   The ship radioed to the Coast Guard traffic center in Valdez
that it was going outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid ice,
but it never radioed back to say it was changing course again to
avoid Bligh Reef.
   Taylor said he lost sight of the tanker on radar and had no
indication it was in trouble. Minutes before it struck Bligh Reef,
Taylor was handing over his duties to controller Bruce Blandford.
   ``When I relieved Mr. Taylor, there was no reason for me to
believe there was anything out of place,'' Blandford said.
   Exxon representative William J. Deppe, who has rarely questioned
witnesses during the hearings, suggested to Taylor that inadequate
radar coverage may have contributed to the accident.
   ``If you were to see a vessel that was about to go aground, you
might recommend they change course?'' Deppe asked.
   ``Right,'' Taylor replied.
   Blandford testified that a test performed about 14 hours after
the wreck showed he had consumed alcohol, but he said it was from
``a couple of drinks to more or less calm down'' after his long
shift.
   ``After I'd finished my eight-hour watch and put in four more
hours of mayhem, I was pretty stressed out and pretty tired by the
time I came home,'' he said.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, unfazed by
a government report on inflation that was slightly worse than
expected.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 5 points in
the early going, was up 7.33 at 2,469.76 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 745 up, 606 down and
549 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.7 percent in April, bringing the increase in the index so far in
1989 to an annual rate of 6.6 percent.
   The monthly number came in near the high end of advance
estimates on Wall Street, and apparently disappointed some traders
who had been hoping for a pleasant surprise in the data.
   Still, analysts noted that much of the increase came, as
expected, from a jump in energy prices that is not expected to be
repeated in coming months.
   That left the door open for stock-market bulls who contend that
the Federal Reserve has a good chance of succeeding in its effort
to restrain inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.
   Avon Products led the active list, down 6{ at 33|. Amway Corp.
withdrew a $39-a-share takeover bid for the company after Avon's
board rejected the offer.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Paper, up 1}

   The Bush administration today renewed its
strong opposition to Senate-passed restrictions on the $6 billion
FSX fighter jet del, with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
saying they would put the entire warplane agreement with Japan at
risk.
   In a letter to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Baker urged
the panel not to adopt the Senate legislation sponsored by Sen.
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. Baker said the Byrd resolution
``establishes an unacceptable precedent infringing on the
president's constitutional authority with respect to the conduct of
negotiations with foreign powers.''
   He added, ``The conditions stated in the resolution would put
the entire FSX program and our agreement with Japan at risk.''
   House critics of the FSX deal initially had planned to go before
the Foreign Affairs Committee today to urge adoption of the
restrictions embodied in the Byrd resolution. But the panel instead
heard from several administration officials who underscored the
opposition stated in Baker's letter. Committee action on the
resolution was postponed until next Tuesday.
   Byrd's measure directs the White House to bar the transfer of
sophisticated jet engine technology to Japan and to guarantee that
American companies will get at least 40 percent of the work on the
FSX, an advanced version of the U.S. F-16 fighter.
   Earlier, the White House had said it has ``grave concerns'' that
the Byrd amendment could erode presidential authority. The State
Department said the provision could force renegotiation of the
agreement with the Japanese government.
   The Senate voted by a 52-47 margin Tuesday to defeat a
resolution that would have scrapped the FSX deal. But it then voted
72-27 to adopt Byrd's restrictions.
   General Dynamics is to join with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to codevelop and coproduce the next-generation fighter,
for deployment by Japan in the late 1990s. General Dynamics has
headquarters in St. Louis, but most of the FSX work would be done
at its F-16 plant in Fort Worth, Texas.
   In the House, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who campaigned for
the Democratic presidential nomination last year on a platform
urging retaliation against unfair trade practices by Japan, said it
is essential that Congress adopt the amendment because ``we don't
want some vague promise that doesn't get fulfilled.''
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., another outspoken opponent of the
FSX, declared that ``it is important to hold the administration's
feet to the fire. We're saying that when you negotiate a deal,
demonstrate that we are really going to get the 40 percent you were
talking about.''
   The Senate passed the Byrd amendment by a margin that would
override a presidential veto and Levine said there is a good chance
the House can follow suit.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said the Byrd amendment was a
classic example of ``micromanagement'' by Congress. He described it
as ``a sour-grape amendment by those who lost the vote against FSX
in the Senate.''
   However, Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., predicted that a
number of Republicans would join the House's Democratic majority in
supporting the restrictions.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
told House Republicans his administration would work against the
Byrd amendment when the measure gets to a House-Senate conference
committee to resolve differences between the measures passed by the
two chambers.
   Fitzwater said Bush was concerned about the amendment because
``it creates a system of congressional approval over these kinds of
projects that we consider to be erosive of presidential power.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said Bush had
asked Republicans to support him on the FSX even though they face
opposing pressure from back home.

   Burger King's new management moved Thursday to turn
around years of erratic advertising results by selecting two new
agencies to handle the major portion of its $215 million
advertising and marketing account.
   ``This is a non-traditional approach, but for us it is far more
important to be right, rather than conventional,'' said Barry J.
Gibbons, Burger King Corp.'s chief executive.
   D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of New York will concentrate on
reinforcing brand identity, while Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising of
New York will concentrate on day-to-day brand retailing, Burger
King said.
   The agencies replace N.W. Ayer, the New York-based ad agency
hired 20 months ago that created the ``We do it like you'd do it''
theme Burger King began using in January 1988.
   The British-based conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC acquired
Burger King as part of its buyout of the Pillsbury Co., based in
Minneapolis, in January. The Miami-based Burger King is a
subsidiary of Pillsbury.
   Burger King, which had systemwide sales of $5.4 billion in 5,800
restaurants during fiscal year 1988, has had little or no sales
growth over the past four years although it has held on to its
second-place position in the fast-food market behind industry
leader McDonald's Corp.
   Average sales per restaurant slipped 1 percent last year, but
finished above $1 million for the fourth consecutive year, Burger
King said.
   The company estimates its market share has held fairly steady
over that period at about 17 percent.
   Gary L. Langstaff, hired in April as Burger King's executive
vice president of marketing after three years with Hardee's, said
the dual-agency approach is part of an overall effort to improve
the focus of Burger King advertising.
   ``There are two keys for us _ day-to-day and long-term branding.
Our goal is to make both of those work in tandem,'' Langstaff said.
   He said no decision had been made yet on how ad spending would
be split between the two new agencies. He also declined to estimate
when advertising from the new agencies may start running.
   Langstaff said Burger King will continue to work on a
project-by-project basis with both its national promotion agencies,
Einson-Freeman Inc., and August, Bishop and Meier. Burger King's
relationships are unchanged with other advertising agencies,
UniWorld Group Inc. and Castor Spanish International. UniWorld and
Castor create ads for Burger King aimed at minority markets.
   Burger King disclosed last month that it planned to replace Ayer
on the national portion of its advertising business, but said Ayer
would continue to produce regional advertising.
   With Thursday's announcement, Burger King indicated it would
sever all ties with Ayer after a brief transition period.
   Ayer was selected in September 1987 as Burger King's ad agency,
ending the fast-food company's 11-year association with J. Walter
Thompson of New York.
   Thompson's work for Burger King included a roundly criticized
1986 campaign that featured a search for the nerdy Herb, who had
never been to a Burger King.
   Subsequent campaigns from Thompson that used the themes ``This
is a Burger King Town'' and ``The Best Food for Fast Times'' failed
to spark sales.
   But Ayer's ``We do it'' campaign also failed to boost sales.
Burger King also underwent a series of unsettling management
changes during Ayer's tenure.
   ``It has been said many times that timing is everything,'' Jerry
Siano, the head of Ayer said Thursday in a memo to his employees.
``We were a year and a half early.''
   He said Grand Met has indicated ``a commitment to management
stability and marketing focus that will become the vital
ingredients to Burger King's future success. We wish them much
success.''
   A jubilant Edward J. Wax, chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, said he and other executives would travel soon to Miami to
begin defining roles and working up strategies.
   ``Obviously, we think they're a tremendous company,'' Wax said
from New York. ``There's a lot to be done, there's been a lot of
negative stuff written. It's a big challenge. But we're excited.''
   Wax called the two-agency approach fascinating and innovative
and said his earlier study of Burger King found strong management
commitment to improvement.
   His agency in the past has handled assignments for the fast food
operators Krystal, Wendy's, and Arby's, Wax said, and experienced
executives from those accounts will work on Burger King.

<HEAD>Dollar Succumbs to Intervention, Gold Steady</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar succumbed to a barrage of central bank
intervention and ended sharply lower from earlier peaks in
volatile, nervous European trading Thursday.
   Gold prices steadied.
   Foreign exchange dealers said that while underlying demand for
the dollar remained strong, a sense of disarray pervaded the market.
   The dollar entered the European trading day on a weaker note,
after at least three rounds of Bank of Japan intervention earlier
Wednesday, dealers said.
   The U.S. currency then surged to its session highs late in the
morning, when the West German Bundesbank's central bank council
decided to leave its key interest rates unchanged.
   The dollar was supported further by news that U.S. consumer
prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in April, slightly
above average market forecasts.
   Later, a wave of concerted intervention started the dollar on
its downward move to its late levels.
   Joining the U.S. Federal Reserve, which intervened three times,
were the central banks of Britain, Switzerland, France, Belgium,
Austria, Italy and Canada, dealers said. The Bundesbank was
conspicuously absent, they said.
   ``The dollar was overbought, although there is still good
support underneath,'' said the chief dealer at a U.S. investment
bank. ``People are nervous over what the central banks have up
their sleeves.''
   ``The intervention put a temporary top on the dollar but it
hasn't turned sentiment, said a corporate dealer at an American
bank in London.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6180 to buy one pound, dearer than $1.6140 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.9660 West German marks, down from 1.9675; 1.7552 Swiss francs,
down from 1.7580; 6.6490 French francs, down from 6.6607; 2.2240
Dutch guilders, up from 2.2150; 1,439.50 Italian lire, up from
1,433.00; 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1925.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.18 yen to close at 138.88 yen. Later in London it
was quoted at 138.60 yen.
   Gold held steady in London to a late bid price of $370.75 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold rose slightly to close at a bid $370.50,
compared with $370.25 late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold fell $3.01 to close at a bid $371.73.
   Silver fell on the London market where the metal was trading at
a late bid price of $5.43 a troy ounce, compared with $5.46
Wednesday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Thursday in modest trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, as
traders discounted rains in western crop states and looked forward
to expected dry conditions next week.
   Corn and soybean futures rose following word that the National
Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast released Wednesday calls
for below-normal rain and above-normal temperatures in much of the
Corn Belt.
   ``There were some rumors that the Soviet Union has purchased
soymeal and soy oil out of South America,'' said Ted Mao, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., adding that the rumors
were not confirmed.
   Wheat prices dropped over concern that there hasn't been much
export of the grain recently. However, the Agriculture Department's
announcement Wednesday that the export bonus program would continue
as long as other nations subsidize their grain sales offered some
lift, analysts said.
   Mao noted that the action in the market has not varied much in
recent sessions.
   ``A lot of traders have memories of last year's market and are
trying to tie it in with this year's,'' said Mao. ``The volitility
is not there. The weather is not bad enough and there are more
acres planted. Traders will have to adjust to conditions as they
are today.''
   At the close, wheat was a { cent lower to 1 cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.08{ a bushel; corn was 1\
cent lower to 3 cent higher with May at $2.76 a bushel; oats were a
{ cent to } cent lower with May at $1.83{ a bushel; soybeans were 3
cents to 8{ cents higher with May at $7.37{ a bushel.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Issues Warning on U.S.-EC Agriculture Dispute</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Failure by the United States and the
European Community to fashion an agricultural reform plan could
lead to serious trade disputes, the departing U.S. ambassador to
the trading bloc warned Thursday.
   ``If the movement to reform worldwide agriculture fails, then we
could have, in my judgment, around the world a real trade war,''
said Alfred H. Kingon, the U.S. representative to the 12-nation
Common Market.
   Kingon, who leaves his post June 3 after more than two years,
told reporters he generally was optimistic about trade relations
between the United States and the Common Market.
   ``There has been an effort especially in the last 12 months to
try to put the tiffs that we have...into some kind of
perspective...and not let (them) unhinge the whole relationship,''
he said.
   Kingon noted, however, that the two sides have not settled a
fight over a European ban on imports of American beef from cattle
treated with growth hormones. They also are at odds over government
support for Airbus Industrie, a four-nation European aircraft
building consortium that competes with Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp.
   But he said the most troublesome dispute concerned efforts to
reach agreement on the politically sensitive issue of government
subsidies to farmers.
   The United States, the Common Market and other countries are
tackling agricultural policies as part of international trade talks
held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. GATT is a forum and an agreement for removing
trade barriers.
   Kingon said that if the United States and the Common Market do
not resolve their differences, ``then I must say I'm pessimistic
about what will happen to the trade relations between the two
groups.''
   The two sides agreed last month to freeze current farm support
levels and reduce aid in 1990. The accord provides a framework for
further discussions under the Uruguay Round of talks to liberalize
global trade. The round ends in 1990.
   The United States wants the European Community to end import
barriers and export and domestic farm subsidies that it says
distort trade.
   Kingon also predicted the European Community's openness to
foreign goods after it becomes a single market in 1992 will depend
on competition within the trade bloc and on world economic
conditions.
   Once the barriers are dismantled, he said, European business
executives will find their companies facing strong competition from
other European concerns. These tougher business conditions, he
said, may take place during a period of economic recession.
   ``The convergence of those two forces will put to the test the
often-stated, well-intentioned expression...that this will be an
open market,'' he said.
   American and other foreign officials and business executives
worry the Europeans may use the single market to try to keep out
U.S. and other foreign competition.
   The European-wide market is intended reduce barriers that keep
goods, services, people and money from moving freely among the 12
countries.

<HEAD>Minorco Appealing Judge's Refusal to Lift Injunction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorco SA said Thursday it was appealing a U.S.
judge's refusal to lift a preliminary injunction that scuttled its
hostile $5.7 billion attempted takeover of Consolidated Gold Fields
PLC.
   The Luxembourg-based, South African-controlled Minorco said the
appeal was filed Wednesday to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit.
   The preliminary injunction blocked Minorco from buying more than
30 percent of the British gold mining giant's shares.
   Minorco owns 29.9 percent of the shares and had received
acceptances for its takeover offer that would have taken its
holding to 55 percent. A merger of the two companies would have
created the noncommunist world's largest gold producing concern.
   Repeated attempts by Minorco to have the injunction lifted were
denied by Judge Michael Mukasey of the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York.
   The offer expired Wednesday under British takeover regulations
and Minorco must wait a year before it can make another bid for
Gold Fields, if it wants to. However, if another suitor makes a bid
for Gold Fields, Minorco can make a competing offer.
   The suit that resulted in the injunction was brought by Gold
Fields and by its 49-percent owned subsidiary Newmont Mining Corp.
Gold Fields later withdrew from the action, leaving just Newmont to
pursue the case.
   Minorco said it is defending itself against Newmont's lawsuit.
Further action in the U.S. courts, including the appeal, doesn't
suggest any decision has been taken regarding its pursuit of Gold
Fields, the company said.
   Minorco's continued efforts to overturn the U.S. court
injunction could be an attempt to clear up any antitrust concerns
in the United States in case the company decides to seek future
expansion in the U.S. natural resource sector.
   Minorco is 39.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. and 21
percent owned by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which are,
respectively, the gold and diamond mining interests of South
African Oppenheimer family.

   Singing ``What do you do with a drunken
sailor, make him skipper of an Exxon tanker,'' more than 250
demonstrators protested outside the oil company's annual
shareholder meeting Thursday.
   Demonstrators wearing costumes and holding signs reading
``Overthrow Exxon'' and ``Clean up your entire mess'' lined the
entranceway as Exxon Corp. stockholders arrived for the meeting at
the Aspen Manor Hotel, where about 80 police officers corralled
protesters in a parking lot.
   Protesters acted peacefully but spoke angrily about the March 24
spill of millions of gallons of crude oil from the tanker Exxon
Valdez into Alaska's Prince William Sound, the nation's worst oil
spill ever.
   ``Our environment is going to hell in a bucket,'' said Rae
McLaughlin, a 30-year-old office manager and member of New Jersey
Citizen Action, one of the environmental groups sponsoring the
protest. ``They're not even attempting to clean it up.''
   She and many others blamed Exxon for hiring Joseph Hazelwood,
captain of the Exxon Valdez. The Coast Guard has said Hazelwood
tested above the legal limit for alcohol nine hours after the
accident, but Hazelwood has pleaded innocent to charges of
operating a vessel while drunk.
   ``The whole thing was ridiculous,'' Ms. McLaughlin said. ``There
was no reason to have a drunk person at the helm.''
   Five demonstrators perched on stilts wore pig tails and pig
noses to complement their overstuffed tuxedos and briefcases
festooned with Exxon stickers and bulging with fake money.
   ``We just came to say we don't have to care, because we're
Exxon,'' said Isabel Byrd, a 51-year-old theater worker from
Trenton, who identified herself as a ``pig from Exxon.''
   One speakers addressing the crowd, many of whom wore black arm
bands and waved rags saying, ``Clean Energy Now,'' was Barry
Commoner, the environmentalist and former presidential candidate
from the Citizen's Party.
   He and other protesters said the spill points out the oil
industry's failure to prepare for such disasters, the United
States' overreliance on fossil fuels and a need to convert to solar
energy.
   Commoner also drew cheers from the crowd, which basked in sunny
80-degree weather, when he laughed at Exxon's proposal to add an
environmentalist to its board of directors.
   ``If the dying sea otters could talk, if the American people,
aghast at the criminal incompetence of the Exxon management could
be heard, if justice is to be done, the proper punishment is not
adding one environmentalist to the board of directors,'' Commoner
said. ``The proper punishment is to replace every one of them.''
   Steve Kosnac, a 63-year-old retiree from Somerville who said he
helped lay the Alaska pipeline during the 1970s, accused Exxon of
deliberately spilling the oil. Spoiling the coastline of Prince
William Sound would render it useless for anything but oil
exploration, he said.
   ``Oil companies are oil companies,'' Kosnac said. ``They're big
money and they'd walk through your property and just fight you in
court at a later date.''
   Others said the time had passed to lay blame and hoped the
disaster would spur Congress to pass legislation halting oil
exploration in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge.
   Township Mayor Frank Priore said his sympathies lay with the
protesters and that he would ask Exxon to pay the police overtime
costs, which he estimated between $12,000 and $18,000.

   The stock market climbed to a new post-crash
high today, unfazed by a government report on inflation that was
slightly worse than expected.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.7 percent in April, bringing the increase in the index so far in
1989 to an annual rate of 6.6 percent.
   The monthly number came in near the high end of advance
estimates on Wall Street, and apparently disappointed some traders
who had been hoping for a pleasant surprise in the data.
   Still, analysts noted that much of the increase came, as
expected, from a jump in energy prices that is not considered
likely to be repeated in coming months.
   That left the door open for stock-market bulls who contend that
the Federal Reserve has a good chance of succeeding in its effort
to restrain inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.

   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds rose $4.9 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record total of $311.95 billion in the seven-day
period ended Wednesday, followed a $2.9 billion increase in the
funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit the previous record high of $307.06
billion in the week ended May 10.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $644 million to $101.42
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $1.91 billion
to $131.38 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds rose
$2.35 billion to $79.14 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.16 percent from 9.15 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield was 9.17 percent, unchanged from the
previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
36 days, up from 34 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 6.63
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.27
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 9.31 the
previous week. Yields were 9.42 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
9.48 percent; 9.23 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 9.27 percent;
and 9.14 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 9.18 percent.

   Crude oil prices edged higher in uneven trading
Thursday as the market failed to respond forcefully to any outside
news.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 7 cents to $20.20 a 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the June contract
fell 57 cents.
   ``It's choppy and very erratic,'' said Jim Fiedler, a trader
with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. ``The market is not
reacting to bullish news at this point.''
   A handful of developments that normally would move prices higher
were largely ignored Thursday, including a fire at an oil facility
in West Germany and flooding that could hamper the movement of
crude in East Texas, Fiedler said.
   Prices of refined products traded on the mercantile exchange
were mixed as traders responded to seasonal supply-demand
influences.
   The June contract for wholesale gasoline rose 1.26 cents a
gallon to close at 64.53 cents. On Wednesday, the contract plunged
2.53 cents as traders decided there was an oversupply of gasoline,
but on Thursday, after reassessing the situation, the market
anticipated increased demand during the summer driving season,
Fiedler said.
   The June contract for home heating oil fell 0.41 cent to 47.55
cents a gallon Thursday as traders believed there would be ample
supply of the fuel, he said. The contract fell 1.23 cents on
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Chrysler Agrees to Buy Thrifty; All Big Three in Auto Rental Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Thursday it has agreed to
acquire Thrifty-Rent-A-Car Systems Inc. for $263 million, becoming
the last of the Big Three automakers to take a stake in the rental
car business.
   The agreement, announced by Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca during
the company's annual meeting in San Francisco, calls for Chrysler
to pay $27.75 a share for all of the Tulsa, Okla.-based Thrifty's
stock.
   Thrifty's five major shareholders have granted options to
Chrysler for acquisition of 54 percent of the outstanding shares.
   The news sent Thrifty's stock price up $9.25 a share to $27.25
in national over-the-counter trading. In trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, Chrysler rose 37{ cents a share to $24.75.
   Ford Motor Co. has interests in Hertz Corp. and Budget Rent A
Car Corp., and General Motors Corp. owns part of National Car
Rental.
   Iacocca called Thrifty, the fifth-largest car rental company in
North America, ``a solid player in the car rental business.''
Thrifty's management would remain in place.
   ``We are delighted with the prospect of joining forces with
Chrysler,'' said Thrifty Chairman William E. Lobeck Jr. ``Our board
of directors recommends unanimously that stockholders tender their
shares.''
   Chrysler is epected to make a tender offer starting by Wednesday
for Thrifty stock. Chrysler supplies 75 percent to 80 percent of
the cars in Thrifty's fleet.
   The rental car business is appealing to the automakers for
several reasons.
   Rental cars make up a substantial portion of each automaker's
fleet sales. They also provide added exposure of the products away
from the showroom that could turn into sales later.
   On a smaller scale, sales of cars to rental car companies can
help inventories of some models and serve as a testing ground for
new trim packages or options.
   ``Obviously, it's a defensive move to keep its access to fleet
markets,'' auto analyst Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of
San Francisco said of the Chrysler-Thrifty deal. ``But defensive
moves don't necessarily make you money.''
   Ford, the nation's No. 2 automaker, had held 55 percent of Hertz
Corp., the nation's largest automobile renter. In a deal announced
earlier this month, Volvo North American Corp. acquired a portion
of Ford's equity which would reduce Ford's ownership to 49 percent
of Hertz's stock.
   In March, a financing package was completed in which Ford would
provide $324 million for the acquisition of Budget Rent a Car
Corp., the third-largest car rental company in the nation, by Beech
Holdings Corp. Ford's equity in that deal involved non-voting
preferred shares of Beech.
   Ford supplies about 70 percent of Budget's cars and a majority
of the 180,000-car fleet operated by Hertz, which refused to say
exactly how many cars were Ford products.
   GM, the nation's largest automaker, acquired a ``significant
minority interest'' last September in National Car Rental, the
nation's fourth-largest car renter. GM spokesman Peter Peterson
declined to say how much interest GM held in National.
   GM provides National with about 75 percent of its cars.
   Avis Inc., the nation's second-largest automobile renter, is
privately held.
   Thrifty, which licenses more than 650 outlets worldwide,
reported $2.6 million in profit on revenues of $28.6 million during
the first three months of this year. For the fiscal year ended June
30, 1988, the company made $9.1 million on revenues of $79.3
million.

<HEAD>Strong Dollar Pushes Gold, Platinum Lower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Precious metals futures prices fell sharply
Thursday on New York's Commodity Exchange as investors continued
bailing out of the market because of the strong dollar.
   On other markets, grain and soybeans were mixed, livestock and
meat prices settled mostly lower, and energy futures were mostly
higher.
   Precious metal prices dropped as the dollar continued to display
strength despite coordinated dollar selling by central banks in
Europe and Japan. A stronger dollar generally tends to attract
speculators from other investment such as precious metals.
   Prices were pressured as the dollar remained firm following the
government's report that consumer price inflation soared 0.7
percent in April, the sharpest advance in more than two years.
   Gold settled $3.20 to $3.60 lower with the contract for delivery
in May at $369.70 a troy ounce and silver was 2.8 cents to 3.0
cents lower with May at $5.401 a troy ounce.
   Platinum prices also moved sharply lower, at one time falling
$19.90 from Wednesday's close before rallying to finish $7.20 to
$7.70 lower with July at $502.70 a troy ounce.
   Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, said despite recent reports that demand for
platinum outpaces supply, many speculators are not convinced and
are unloading the metal.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live and feed cattle prices drifted lower in reaction to
Wednesday's Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report showing
higher than expected April marketings and feedlot placement.
   Lower cash prices can be expected later this year because of the
high feed lot placement, analysts say.
   Hog prices slipped with lower cash bids, and prospects of
increased marketing in coming days, said Dale Durchholz, an analyst
with Agri-Visor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Frozen pork belly futures were down because of deteriorating
cash prices.
   Live cattle were .53 cent to .80 cent lower with June at 70.67
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .90 cent lower with
May at 76.97 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .37 cent a pound
with June at 48.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .65 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with May at 35.10 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed in modest trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade, as traders discounted rains in western crop
states and looked forward to expected dry conditions next week.
   Corn and soybean futures rose following word that the National
Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast released Wednesday called
for below-normal rain and above-normal temperatures in much of the
Corn Belt.
   Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., also said
prices were supported by unconfirmed rumors that the Soviet Union
had purchased soymeal and soy oil from South America.
   Wheat prices dropped over concern that there hasn't been much
export of the grain recently. However, the Agriculture Department's
announcement Wednesday that the export bonus program would continue
as long as other nations subsidize their grain sales provided some
support, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher, with May at
$4.08\ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 3 cents higher with May
at $2.76 a bushel; oats were a { cent to 1 cent lower with May at
$1.83 a bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 8\ cents higher with May
at $7.37{ a bushel.
   Energy prices moved higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 7 cents to 14 cents higher
with June at $20.20 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent to .44 cent
lower with June at 47.55 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .30
cent lower to 1.26 cents higher with June at 64.53 cents a gallon.

   Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl
rejected a call for his resignation Thursday but assured company
shareholders that he and other Exxon management would be part of
major policy changes at the company, including random drug testing.
   ``I want you to know there's going to be equity,'' Rawl told
about 1,700 Exxon shareholders attending the first annual meeting
since the March 24 spill by the tanker Exxon Valdez. ``We will have
random testing of our people and of senior management, including
me.''
   Addressing stockholders at the start of the meeting, Rawl
repeated his apologies for the disaster and pledged again to clean
up the fouled waters and beaches in and around Alaska's Prince
William Sound.
   Rawl showed a brief film made by Exxon about its cleanup efforts
and later fielded shareholder questions for nearly four hours in
what turned out to be a quieter meeting than company officials had
anticipated.
   Dozens of local police and company security patrolled inside and
outside the meeting hall, bags were checked and people attending
had to pass through metal detectors.
   A crowd of orderly demonstrators carried signs and chanted
slogans outside but were kept at least 50 yards from the entrance.
Some sang, ``What do you do with a drunken sailor, make him skipper
of an Exxon tanker.''
   Parsippany police and Exxon officials estimated the crowd at
about 150, while other estimates were as high as 250. Exxon
officials said they had expected at least 600 demonstrators.
   Five demonstrators perched on stilts wore pig tails and pig
noses to complement their overstuffed tuxedos and briefcases
festooned with Exxon stickers and bulging with fake money.
   ``We just came to say we don't have to care, because we're
Exxon,'' said Isabel Byrd, a 51-year-old theater worker from
Trenton, N.J., who identified herself as a ``pig from Exxon.''
   Inside, Ed Rothschild, director of the consumer group Citizen
Action, called on Rawl to resign.
   ``We think that the shareholders and the board need to have a
new set of people to deal with these circumstances and to set the
company on a new course,'' said Rothschild, who owns one share of
stock. ``The question is, will you resign and if not why not?''
   ``The answer is, no I won't,'' Rawl replied to a chorus of boos
mixed with applause. Rawl said the best thing Exxon could do was
abide by the promises the company has already made.
   Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation and a
wildlife biologist, called on Exxon to set up a multibillion-dollar
cleanup trust fund starting with $1 billion immediately and annual
contributions of $1 billion a year thereafter.
   Rawl rejected that proposal last week, saying the company has
already committed to doing everything possible to clean up the
spill.
   Hair, representing holders of 48,000 shares of Exxon stock, told
Exxon management that areas already designated as cleaned by Exxon
remain badly soiled.
   ``It's an absolute joke,'' Hair said of the cleanup. ``You can
pick up a rock and it drips oil.''
   Robin Dexter, a commercial salmon fisherman whose livelihood has
depended on the now-fouled Alaska waters, said he purchased 10
shares of Exxon stock just to be able to attend Thursday's meeting.
   ``My intention is to convince people in the (fishing) industry
to accumulate shares so we can seriously put an issue before
shareholders that will result in some changes,'' Dexter said later.
   Several large pension funds had threatened in the weeks leading
up to the meeting to vote against management if it didn't
demonstate its willingness to avert future spills.
   In the final tally, 976.6 million shares, or 77.8 percent, were
voted in favor of electing the current slate of directors.
   Exxon President Lee Raymond said the number of customers who had
returned their Exxon credit cards was up to 18,000 out of a total
of 7 million.
   Among the demands by the institutional shareholders were the
appointment to the board of an environmental expert and the
formation of a committee to review Exxon policies on the
environment and worker safety and health.
   Rawl, who has agreed to both requests, said the company was
reviewing a list of candidates and that an environmentalist would
begin serving on the board before next year's shareholders meeting.
   Despite jibes and name-calling by dissident stockholders, Rawl
told reporters afterward it wasn't as bad as he had expected.
   Rawl called the recommendations useful and fair.
   ``I don't feel beat upon,'' he said.
   ``We've got to communicate better,'' he said. ``It's incumbent
on me to communicate better. We have to keep working on this
problem. But we're going to get our reputation back.''

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
dropped in early May, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell
$8.7 billion in the week ended May 8 to a seasonally adjusted
$772.9 billion from $781.6 billion the previous week.
   The central bank said a broader measure known as M2 lost $1.9
billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,069.7 billion from $3,071.6
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell $1.8 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $3,953.3 billion from $3,955.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3.077.2 billion, a 1.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,950.2 billion, up 3.8 percent, while M1
fell 1.8 percent to an average of $784.4 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $535 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$530 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $289.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $290.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   Xerox Corp. Chairman David T. Kearns predicted
Thursday the company's restructuring would improve pre-tax profit
by $50 million to $60 million this year and more in coming years.
   The restructuring of business products and systems, announced in
January, will cut costs enough to increase pre-tax profits by $100
million to $120 million in 1990 and following years, Kearns said at
the company's annual meeting.
   Kearns also said the company intends to remain independent.
   ``The board of directors has no plan or intention for the
company to be acquired,'' Kearns said. ``The board believes that
the best interests of our shareholders, customers and employees
would be served by continuing to pursue our strategic direction as
an independent company.
   ``We believe the most effective way of increasing the return to
our shareholders is through improved financial returns,'' he said.
   Kearns also indicated that the company has not been approached,
and noted that no one shareholder has as much as 5 percent of the
Stamford, Conn.-based company's stock.
   In 1988, the company had pre-tax income of $1 billion, with a
net income of $388 million, and per-share earnings of $3.50, both
declines from previous years.
   Under its restructuring, Xerox is scaling back its electronic
typewriter business, cut about 2,000 jobs and ending the marketing
of medical hardware that combines xerography and radiography. The
changes resulted in a pre-tax charge of $275 million.
   ``Assuming a reasonably stable economic environment, which I
believe we have, and barring any major catastrophe or dislocation
in financial markets, our total corporate earnings should continue
to grow in 1989,'' Kearns said.
   Also at Thursday's meeting, the shareholders re-elected 14
members of the board, and turned aside several shareholder
resolutions, including ones from pension funds that the company
sever all ties with South Africa and adopt the MacBride principles,
which seek to assure equal employment opportunity for Catholics in
Northern Ireland.
   In addition to computers and office products, the company also
includes a financial services group, led by Crum and Forster Inc.
insurance company, Xerox Credit Corp.; Van Kampen Merritt Inc., a
specialized investment banking firm; Furman Selz, a investment bank
and stock broker; Xerox Financial Services Insurance Co.; and a
number of joint ventures.

   WPP Group PLC began its $54-a-share tender offer
for Ogilvy Group Inc. on Thursday, two days after its advertising
rival's board of directors approved the $864 million buyout
proposal.
   The tender offer expires at midnight EDT on June 15, and the
deal would be the largest ever in the advertising business.
   The offer is contingent upon receipt of at least two-thirds of
Ogilvy's 16 million shares on a fully diluted basis.
   WPP, the world's third-largest advertising and marketing
services concern, would become the second largest with billings of
about $13.5 billion if the deal is completed. It would trail
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC, another London-based concern with slightly
more than $13.5 billion in billings.

<HEAD>Chicago Fed: Farm Debt Fell For a Fifth Straight Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm debt fell for a fifth straight year
in 1988, dropping nearly 3 percent from 1987 and down almost 28
percent from its 1983 peak, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
reports.
   The report also says that while farm debt was shrinking, the
quality of farm loans still held by most lenders continued to
improve and repayment rates remained high despite the drought of
1988.
   The Chicago Fed said total farm debt, not counting price support
loans from the Commodity Credit Corp. and consumer loans for farm
households, dropped to $138.6 billion last year from $142.7 billion
in 1987.
   About $77 billion was loaned to buy farmland and the remaining
$61.6 billion was to finance operating expenses or capital
expenditures, such as the purchase of machinery.
   Real estate debt was down 27 percent from its 1983 peak and
non-real estate debt was off 30 percent, with each of those
components retreating to 10-year lows, said a report by economist
Gary Benjamin in the Chicago Fed's Agricultural Letter publication.
   At the same time, the value of all farm assets rose almost 5
percent last year to about $743 billion, climbing about 7.5 percent
above the 1986 low.
   Compared with the 1981 peak, however, the value of farm assets
was still down by 25 percent, economist Peter Heffernan said in a
companion report.
   Heffernan said the overall reduction of farm debt combined with
the continued growth of assets increased total net worth of farmers
by 6.7 percent.
   ``The current forecast of the farm sector's balance sheet at the
end of this year points to continued improvement in the sector's
financial condition,'' Heffernan wrote.
   He said the value of farmland and other agricultural assets each
are expected to continue to rise about 2 percent. Heffernan also
said farm debt is expected to show its first year-to-year rise
since 1983, with forecasts indicating an increase of 2 percent to 3
percent.
   ``Despite the expected increase in debt, farm sector equity is
projected to show a moderate increase in 1989, rising 1 to 2
percent from last year's level,'' he said.
   Farm sector equity stood at $604 billion at the end of last
year, a gain of 13 percent from the 1986 low. But after adjusting
for inflation, equity was little more than half the 1979 peak and
in a range that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s, Heffernan wrote.
   Benjamin said banks held 30.7 percent of all farm debt last
year, up 4 percent from 1987, while debt held by the Farm Credit
System continued a retreat.
   The Farm Credit System, which is recovering from the brink of
collapse as a result of a congressional rescue, accounted for 26.4
percent of total farm debt in 1988, or $36.6 billion, representing
a drop of $28 billion in five years.
   The Farmers Home Administration accounted for 15.7 percent of
total farm debt, down 7.1 percent from 1987; life insurance
companies held 6.5 percent of farm debt, off 2.4 percent from the
previous year; and individuals and other sources accounted for the
remaining 20.7 percent, down 4.4 percent.
   Despite drought, farm loan repayment rates remained at a high
level in 1988, the report said, supported by generous government
payments to farmers and high prices for commodities.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilots Union Say Future Trump Pilots Don't Have To Honor
Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots union leaders at strikebound Eastern
Airlines say 170 Eastern pilots can go to work for the company's
Northeast shuttle if it is sold to developer Donald Trump,
reversing their earlier position that the pilots should not work
for Trump until the strike was over.
   The pilots, who already have been hired for the planned Trump
Shuttle, had said they planned to defy union leadership's earlier
position.
   Trump's agreement to buy the business for $365 million from
Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. still must be approved by the
federal bankruptcy court.
   The Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association
at Eastern had asked its pilots not to work for Trump or receive
further training for the Trump shuttle as long as the strike
against Eastern continued.
   After a meeting Thursday with Trump Shuttle officials, the
pilots' leadership decided prospective Trump pilots would be
approved to go ahead and start training, said Dan Ashby, a
spokesman for ALPA in New York.
   In an earlier message to pilots, Jack Bavis, the head of the
Eastern pilots union, had directed that ``no pilot, including those
who have accepted employment with the Trump Shuttle, will engage in
any training of any kind until the strike is over or until the
(Master Executive Council) endorses another course of action.''
   Eastern's unions have opposed a sale of the profitable New
York-Washington-Boston shuttle and other Eastern assets.
   The company has been in bankruptcy court protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a Machinists
union strike that was joined by Eastern's pilots and flight
attendants unions and virtually grounded the airline.
   In a letter dated May 2 to Henry Duffy, national president of
ALPA, pilot Bill Sanford said ``the Trump pilots have to question
whether the association is working toward our best interest at
Trump. If the (Master Executive Council) continues to interfere in
our business and ALPA continues to ignore us, then a reassessment
and further examination of our alternatives will obviously have to
be explored.''
   In recent weeks, other prospective Trump pilots have sent a
flurry of similar letters to Trump, Duffy, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland, who is overseeing Eastern's Chapter 11
proceeding. Copies of some of the letters were obtained by The
Associated Press.
   Trump Shuttle management already has signed labor agreements
with pilots and flight attendants.
   America West Airlines, which has made a competing, higher offer
for the shuttle, has said it mainly would use its own employees to
operate the service although Eastern workers would be eligible to
apply for jobs. America West, a regional carrier based in Phoenix,
Ariz., is non-union.
   The company has offered to pay $415 million for the Eastern
shuttle and $336 million for 10 Boeing 757s.
   In addition to the 170 Eastern pilots already hired, another 40
or so pilots have been hired for the Trump Shuttle from other
carriers and elsewhere. Before the strike, Eastern's shuttle was
its only profitable operation. Since then, it has been running
nearly at full schedule but with skimpy passenger loads as many
passengers have defected to Pan Am Corp.'s rival service.
   Eastern said earlier this week that its share of the shuttle
market, split with Pan Am, has dropped to around 23 percent from 53
percent in December of last year.

<HEAD>Macy Chairman Denies Plans to Divest Divisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Thursday said
the retailer feels its financial footing is secure since it went
private in 1986 and it doesn't intend to divest any department
store divisions.
   Edward S. Finkelstein said there have been persistent rumors
that Macy's might be planning to sell off some assets.
   Some of the speculation in publications and circulating in the
retail industry suggests Macy's may be contemplating divestitures
due to concerns about servicing the heavy debt load it took on in
its leveraged buyout.
   ``We have no intention of selling off any divisions and when we
have been approached we have immediately indicated that our
divisions are not for sale,'' Finkelstein stated in a letter to
investors involved in Macy's LBO.
   He also stated that Macy's has received inquiries from
``interested parties about making an investment in our company.''
   ``We listen to and consider all serious ideas,'' he said. ``Thus
far, none have been appropriate for our investors.''
   The letter did not identify who has approached Macy's. The Wall
Street Journal reported Thursday that specialty apparel retailer
Limited Inc. has expressed interest and had preliminary talks with
Macy's about making an investment in the New York-based company.
   Finkelstein also said Macy's debt structure is sound.
   ``The company is well financed and has sufficient liquidity to
fund its on-going business as well as capital expenditures for new
stores and renovations,'' he said.
   Macy's debts are said to total more than $5.2 billion currently.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The austral plunged again
Thursday and interest rates soared as rumors swept the market that
a new currency might be introduced.
   ``No government official at any moment has even thought about
that,'' Treasury Secretary Oscar Merbilhaa said. But the austral
fell by 23 percent, selling for 170 per 1 dollar compared with
131-1 on Wednesday.
   The newspaper La Razon reported in a front-page story that the
government was preparing to introduce a new currency, one unit of
which would equal 100 australs.
   The austral has fallen by 38 percent since national elections
last Sunday, and 90 percent since early February. Interest rates
reached 200 percent a month as banks scrambled to prevent investors
from removing deposits to buy dollars.
   At the close of the business day, the government announced that
effective immediately, bus fares, gasoline, telephone and other
utility rates would be increased by 40 percent. The latest
projections indicate that inflation may top 50 percent this month.
   ``There is little doubt that the Argentine economy is entering
in full a stage of hyperinflation,'' the daily newspaper La Nacion
said in its lead editorial. ``It must be acknowledged that
hyperinflation always has unleashed corrosive political and social
situations.''
   On Sunday, the opposition Peronist Party was returned to power
after an absence of 13 years. The fluctuations stemmed from fears
that the economy was teetering out of control, and worries about
what Peronist economic policies will be.
   ``Our government is not going to embargo deposits, nor
confiscate foreign exchange, nor open security boxes, or anything
like that,'' said Eduardo Menem, a national senator and key adviser
to his brother, president-elect Carlos Menem.

   Central banks battered down the dollar Thursday
in a battle with currency dealers who had driven the currency
sharply upward in recent weeks.
   Traders shrugged off the central bank dollar sales at first but
the rally broke by late-morning trading in New York, when the
dollar hit its highest point in years against key currencies.
   Still, the dollar finished the day less than half a percent
below its levels of late Wednesday, indicating that traders
remained willing to challenge the resolve of government bankers and
finance officials.
   ``We have a market that still wants to test the upside potential
for the dollar,'' said Nicholas Sargen, a Salomon Brothers Inc.
analyst.
   He said estimates of the official dollar sales ranged from $1.5
billion to $3 billion, including heavy sales by the Bank of Japan
during Tokyo trading hours.
   In precious metals trading, gold plunged in late activity to
levels not seen since August 1986. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted gold at $368.30 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
from $371.75 late Wednesday.
   The dollar peaked at 1.9880 West German marks and 139.60
Japanese yen _ approaching what traders consider to psychologically
important levels of 2 marks and 140 yen. Reaching those levels
could incite further speculative buying, dealers say.
   Analysts grasped for explanations for the dollar's strength. The
biggest factor appeared to be momentum of the market itself, which
often moves independently of underlying economic factors.
   A Labor Department inflation report was mildly positive for the
dollar. Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April, or 0.2 percent
excluding food and energy. The report slightly diminished
expectations of an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which
would make returns less attractive on dollar-denominated
investments.
   Also helping the dollar was word that the West German central
bank had decided against raising interest rates to defend the mark.
   Several analysts said central banks would have a hard time
depressing the dollar without interest-rate increases in Japan and
West Germany or rate cuts in the United States.
   But many traders doubt how serious the Federal Reserve and
Treasury Department are about restraining the dollar.
   A strong dollar helps U.S. policymakers fight inflation by
holding down import prices and cooling off exports, said Raymond
Worseck, an economist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Worseck said the dollar should remain strong indefinitely
because global investors believe the United States is a good place
for their investments.
   But Andrew F. Brimmer, a former Federal Reserve governor, said
the dollar eventually will be dragged down by the huge U.S. trade
deficit, which is funneling dollars overseas.
   ``I am convinced that the dollar is responding to short-run
transitory factors and not to long-run factors,'' said Brimmer, who
runs a Washington-based consulting firm, Brimmer &amp; Co.
   Joining the Federal Reserve were the central banks of Britain,
Switzerland, France, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Canada and Japan,
dealers said. The West German Bundesbank was conspicuously absent,
they said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6180 from $1.6140 late
Wednesday. In New York, sterling rose to $1.6175 from $1.6115.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.18 yen from Wednesday to close at 138.88 yen.
Later in London the dollar was quoted at 138.60 yen. In New York
the dollar fell to 138.65 yen from Wednesday's 139.22.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.9670 West German marks, down from
1.9715; 1.7568 Swiss francs, down from 1.7615; 1.1927 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1908; 6.6585 French francs, down from 6.6760;
and 1,433 Italian lire, down from 1,435.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.9660 West German marks, down from 1.9675; 1.7552 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7580; 6.6490 French francs, down from 6.6607;
2.2240 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2150; 1,439.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,433.00; 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1925.
   Gold held steady in London at a late bid of $370.75 a troy
ounce. In Zurich gold rose to $370.50 an ounce from $370.25.
Earlier in Hong Kong gold fell $3.01 from Wednesday to close at a
bid of $371.73.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $369.70 a troy ounce from $373.20.
   Silver fell on the London market to a late bid of $5.43 a troy
ounce from $5.46 Wednesday. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery fell to $5.401 an ounce from $5.429.

<HEAD>Navistar Reports Drop in Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navistar International Corp. on Thursday reported
its net income for the second quarter fell 50 percent from a year
ago because of higher costs and high capacity at factories.
   In the fiscal quarter ended April 30, net income totaled $35
million, or 11 cents a share, down from $70 million, or 24 cents a
share on sales of $1.08 billion in the year-ago period.
   James C. Cotting, Navistar's chairman and chief operating
officer, attributed the decline in earnings to costs associated
with having operations at near-capacity. He also cited the cost of
introducing new truck models and lower parts sales.
   Navistar, a medium and heavy truck and diesel engine
manufacture, reported a 3 percent increase in truck sales during
the second period, a 12 percent increase in shipments of diesel
engines and a 6 percent decline in parts sales.
   Officials said market share of the company's medium and heavy
trucks increased to 27.9 percent in the second quarter of 1989,
compared with 27 percent for the year ago quarter.
   For the first six months of its 1989 fiscal year, Navistar
reported net income of $72.8 million, or 23 cents a share, compared
with $114.9 million, or 39 cents a share a year ago.
   Net income for the first half of 1988 included a one-time
after-tax gain of $24 million from the settlement of Canadian
pension obligations and a $15 million charge to discontinued
operations.
   Sales for the first half of 1989 totalled $2.04 billion,
compared with $1.97 billion for the same period last year.

<TEXT>
   The value of U.S. agricultural exports to the
Soviet Union may climb to a record level this calendar year, an
Agriculture Department report said Thursday.
   Substantially larger corn sales and much higher wheat prices are
expected to push the U.S. farm export value to the Soviet Union
``well above'' last year's $2.25 billion, the department's Economic
Research Service said in its preliminary report.
   Exports in 1988 were nearly 2{ times the value of shipments in
1987 and were exceeded only in 1979 and 1984, the report said.
Further, the United States this year may expand its share of Soviet
grain imports from about 30 percent in 1987 and 45 percent in 1988.
   ``Last year, the U.S.S.R. took 12 percent of the value of all
U.S. grain and feed exports, and the U.S. share of all Soviet
agricultural imports was an estimated 14 percent,'' the report said.

   South Korea, hoping to head off threatened
U.S. trade sanctions, has reached agreement on a package of import
liberalization measures sought by the Bush administration,
officials announced Thursday.
   Under the agreement, to be signed next week, South Korea pledged
to ease conditions on foreign investments and open its market to
foreign-owned travel and advertising agencies and wholesalers of
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills praised the actions taken
by South Korea's negotiators but said the United States still
intends to push for the removal of other trade barriers, especially
those affecting U.S. agricultural products.
   ``Korea's market-opening measures will bring real and
substantial benefits to American and other exporters and
investors,'' she said in a statement.
   Under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, Hills must by May 28 decide
whether to include South Korea in a list of countries that are
possible targets for U.S. retaliation because it has erected unfair
trade barriers against American products.
   Hills' statement did not indicate whether South Korea's action
would be enough to keep it off the target list, but South Korean
officials indicated that they hoped that would be the case.
   ``Chances are higher than a month ago that Korea will be
excluded'' from the list of target countries, said Kim Chil-su,
assistant South Korean trade minister.
   In the agreement, South Korea said it would replace an advance
approval requirement for foreign investment with simple
notification rules, phasing in the change from 1991 through 1993.
South Korea also agreed to admit foreign travel agencies starting
in January 1991, officials said.
   Ms. Hills said the agreements ``create a useful precedent'' for
the current round of global trade liberalization negotiations which
are scheduled to be completed in 1990.
   But she said the United States remains ``committed to further
marketing opening in Korea, especially in agriculture.''
   The Korean side last month announced plans to remove or lower
import barriers by 1991 on 243 farm and fishery products, but in
the latest round it rejected U.S. demands for the opening of its
market to nine more foodstuffs including oranges, officials said.

<HEAD>Southmark Postpones Director Election, Investor Gains Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp., scrambling to avoid default on
$1.1 billion in bonds, on Thursday postponed a special directors
election, a move criticized by dissident shareholders seeking three
seats on the company's board.
   Dallas-based Southmark, which earlier this week announced a
$1.04 billion quarterly loss, said it had decided to postpone the
meeting scheduled for Thursday until May 31 because of the
``enormous confusion'' created by Herbert Parks and his investor
group's ``changing campaign to gain representation on the board of
directors.''
   Parks, meanwhile, called the postponement ``high-handed.''
   ``The board unilaterally postponed a meeting knowing full well
that hundreds of shareholders from all over the United States had
already made arrangements to attend,'' he said.
   Unlike most proxy fights, regulations governing some of
Southmark's subsidiaries prohibit any one person from casting
proxies for more than 10 percent of a company's stock. As a result,
most shareholders would have to attend the meeting in person in
order to cast votes.
   The meeting was scheduled to take place in Atlanta, where
Southmark traces its corporate roots to its beginnings as the real
estate investment trust of Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank. The
rescheduled meeting also is set for Atlanta.
   The announcement was made shortly after a federal judge in North
Carolina refused to stymie Parks' bid. The Federal Home Loan Bank
Board had sought to block Parks under regulations prohibiting a
group from gaining control of a savings and loan association
without federal permission.
   One of Southmark's key holdings is San Jacinto Savings and Loan
Association in Texas.
   Southmark Chairman Arthur G. Weiss, who has headed the company
after its two top officers were ousted in January, said the recent
court maneuverings and statements from Parks have clouded the
issues surrounding the special meeting.
   ``We believe the shareholders deserve an opportunity to fully
consider the significance of these recent developments affecting
the solicitation by the Parks Group,'' Weiss said.
   Parks, a Greensboro, N.C., real estate broker and developer,
first sought to replace all seven Southmark directors with his own
slate but was forced to scale that back to three because of the
federal regulations regarding change in control of financial
institutions.
   Nevertheless the FHLBB still sought to block the election,
claiming the three directors would give the Parks Group effective
control of the company.
   Parks, who owns about 4.5 percent of Southmark's common stock,
undertook his fight for control after complaining that Weiss was
``in way over his head'' in attempts to turn around the company,
which was hit hard by the real estate depression in Texas.
   On Tuesday Southmark reported a $1.04 billion loss for the
quarter ended March 31, mainly because of an $829 million reserve
for losses in its battered real estate holdings.
   The loss reduced the company's net worth to a negative $428
million, putting the company in technical default on about $1.1
billion in mainly junk bonds raised through Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   Southmark said it could continue to pay its creditors, including
bondholders who nevertheless could begin steps to force the company
into bankruptcy.

   An Exxon executive told federal investigators
Thursday that the company has enforced a strict policy against
alcohol and drug violations on its oil tankers by firing 34 people
over the past five years.
   Exxon Shipping Co. president Frank Iarossi also said that Exxon
has spent more than $92 million on the cleanup of the nation's
worst oil spill, caused by its tanker Exxon Valdez hitting a reef
on March 24.
   In a hearing before a National Transportation Safety Board
panel, Iarossi said Exxon ships go through rigorous alcohol and
drug searches involving dogs, trained searchers and occasionally
U.S. Customs Service agents. In the past 6{ years, there have been
30 searches, he said. That comes out to searches of five ships a
year in the 16-ship fleet, he said.
   Iarossi said the company's alcohol and drug policy produced 55
disciplinary cases among its tanker crews over five years,
including the 34 firings. Five of those cases were appealed by
unions and all five were overturned by arbitrators, who found the
policy too severe, he said.
   The policy has come under scrutiny because the Exxon Valdez was
under the command of a captain with a history of alcohol abuse who
lost his driver's license in his home state of New York for drunken
driving.
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood was fired after he was accused of
operating the ship while intoxicated. He is scheduled for trial
June 20 and is not testifying before the NTSB.
   Iarossi said ``it was just by chance'' that he heard of
Hazelwood's alcohol problem in May 1985 after the captain completed
a hospital treatment program. Iarossi noted that such employee
information usually is kept confidential.
   After Hazelwood returned to work, he was monitored by two
supervisors who visited him in port twice a month, Iarossi said.
   Exxon documents released Wednesday portray the former captain as
an able seaman with a history of depression and alcoholism.
   The documents include a 1985 report on his admission to a
hospital for alcohol treatment. A doctor wrote that Hazelwood, then
38, had been drinking excessively and was ``depressed and
demoralized.''
   In other testimony Thursday, a ship engineer aboard the Exxon
Valdez the night it ran aground recalled how he, Hazelwood and
another crewman drank alcoholic beverages at a Valdez bar and pizza
restaurant in the hours before the tanker left port.
   Chief Engineer Jerzy Glowacki repeated details he gave
investigators shortly after the spill.
   Glowacki recalled meeting Hazelwood and the ship's radio officer
at the Pipeline Club in Valdez, where they talked and drank.
   ``I believe he was drinking vodka,'' Glowacki said of Hazelwood.
   Glowacki recalled having three drinks but said he could not
remember how many his fellow crewmen consumed.
   The engineer, who has known Hazelwood for nearly 20 years, said
he could not recall Hazelwood ever appearing intoxicated.
   Exxon also released Hazelwood's work evaluations on Wednesday.
They described him as getting along well with his crew and meeting
the ``normal requirements of the position,'' but lacking in
creativitity or interest in managing a ship.
   Three of the four evaluations recommended at least temporary
shore assignment, but there's no indication company officials acted
on the suggestions.
   The last evaluation, in 1987, said Hazelwood ``handles unusual
situations well'' and rated him above average on decision-making
ability. A 1984 report ranked him high on ``safety consciousness.''
   In Iarossi's testimony, the executive also defended his
company's response to the spill. He said Exxon Shipping Co.
mobilized equipment from around the world and got it to the scene
quickly despite logistical problems.
   Iarossi said the successful movement of the 987-foot tanker off
a Prince William Sound reef, and removal of the ship's unspilled
oil cargo prevented a far worse disaster.
   ``It took a lot of heroics on a lot of people's parts. They did
an absolutely miraculous job under very difficult circumstances,''
Iarossi said on the third day of an NTSB hearing that is to
continue through Saturday.

   The United Auto Workers on Thursday
requested a vote on collective bargaining at Nissan's Smyrna plant,
where management complained the union was conducting a drawn-out
organizing campaign.
   ``We've already told our day-shift employees through the use of
a video that the petition has been filed, that it's of no
particular surprise to us, and that we're glad to put this issue
behind us,'' said Gail O. Neuman, Nissan Motor Manufacturing Co.'s
vice president of human resources.
   The UAW filed the petition with the National Labor Relations
Board, asking it to authorize 2,400 production workers to vote
whether they wish to be represented.
   ``The in-plant organizing committee feels the time is right.
They feel the enthusiasm inside the plant for the union is high,''
union spokesman Maxey Irwin said.
   ``I feel confident that the union will be soundly defeated,''
Ms. Neuman said. ``The vast majority of our employees tell us they
have no interest in paying $850,000 a year in dues. Our
communication's open, and they like that.''
   Nissan employees who oppose the union picketed outside the
factory gates with signs saying ``UAW Go Home,'' American flags and
at least one T-shirt that said ``Nissan _ Love it or leave it.''
   Ms. Neuman said the union's card-signing campaign began more
than 16 months ago, and talk about the matter began years before
that.
   ``We feel that the UAW has had more than enough time to present
its case to our employees. The time has come to let our employees
speak through a secret ballot election,'' she said in a statement.
   Should the NLRB agree to allow the election, it would be the
first such vote at Nissan's only U.S. factory. The Japanese company
began producing pickup trucks in 1983 and now also produces Sentra
cars at the plant about 25 miles southeast of Nashville.
   Nissan said last month it will add 2,000 jobs and boost annual
production to 440,000 cars and light pickup trucks a year. The
company says that would make the Smyrna plant the nation's largest
automobile production factory by 1992.
   NLRB procedure calls for it to comment only once it verifies
whether 30 percent of the workers signed cards for union
representation, said Wayne Barksdale, the board's officer in
Nashville.
   He said the NLRB could hold a hearing within two weeks with the
company and the union to work out details of a vote.
   Irwin says the company has pushed production speeds, causing
injuries. Nissan says its health and safety record is better than
most automotive companies in the United States.
   The company says workers are happy with salaries that range from
$12.55 to $17.19 an hour and benefits that equal those of
UAW-organized auto plants.

   Congressional tax writers voted Tuesday to
make savings and loan associations add $600 million to their share
of an industry bailout through 1992 but rejected an income tax
surcharge last used in the Vietnam War to finance the government's
$50 billion share.
   The House Ways and Means Committee amended the S&amp;L legislation
to remove a provision that would have allowed S&amp;Ls to escape $300
million annual industry contributions in 1991 and 1992 toward the
costs of financing the bailout, the biggest in the nation's history.
   That provision had been slipped into President Bush's bailout
bill two weeks ago by House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, at the urging by some of the industry's 12
district Federal Home Loan Banks.
   Before approving the bill on a 26-10 vote, the tax-writing Ways
and Means panel also fought off an attempt to pay for the
government share of the bailout through a five-year 1.5 percent
surtax on personal and corporate income taxes.
   The defeated surtax would have been the first time such a
revenue-raising device was utilized by the government since the
late President Lyndon Johnson used one in the late 1960s to finance
the Vietnam War.
   Its purpose was to save an estimated $200 billion in interest
costs that taxpayers will have to absorb over the next 30 years by
financing the government's share of the bailout through increased
borrowing.
   ``We've got garbage and none of us wants to carry it out,'' said
Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., who proposed the surtax. ``So what we're
saying is that our children and grandchildren are going to carry it
out. That's just morally and ethically wrong.''
   Gibbons' surtax would have added another $150 in taxes a year
for every $10,000 in federal income taxes paid by an individual,
family or company. It also would have violated President Bush's
pledge of ``no new taxes.''
   It was defeated on a 10-13 vote after Rep. Frank J. Guarini,
D-N.J., said it would only ``derail everything that's been done''
in view of President Bush's campaign pledge of ``No new taxes.''
   Over Bush's objection, however, the committee reaffirmed its
vote last week to make the S&amp;L bailout part of the federal deficit,
defeating his elaborate scheme to finance it through private market
bond sales.
   Bush's proposed bond sales would increase the government's total
debt but would have added a total of only $3.5 billion to the
yearly deficits in fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991, allowing the
appearance of overall annual reductions.
   ``The Ways and Means Committee vote to waive
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sets a precedent that would render its budget
discipline meaningless,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   The Congressional Budget Office and others have estimated that
Bush's plan would cost taxpayers an additional $4.5 billion in
interest costs over the next 30 years than if the money was
borrowed directly from the Treasury.
   Under the direct government borrowing alternative approved by
the House tax writers, the deficit would swell by $9.3 billion this
year, $23.3 billion in fiscal 1990 and $13.8 billion in fiscal
1991. Those amounts would be exempted from Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction targets of $100 billion in fiscal 1990 and $64 billion in
fiscal 1991.
   On a voice vote, the committee said that S&amp;Ls have to contribute
$600 million more to the bailout's cost in 1991 and 1992 and
potentially billions of dollars more over the next three decades by
indexing increases in a required $300 million annual contribution
to inflation.
   Bush in February had proposed the industry pay $300 million of
the estimated $4 billion to $5 billion of the annual interest costs
over the next 30 years for the bailout's costs.
   The $300 million is in addition to approximately $6 billion in
up-front money that the nation's 3,000 thrift institutions have to
contribute to the plan.
   But even with those amounts, the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) estimates that taxpayers will absorb 70 percent of the total
estimated bailout tab of $280 billion, including interest, over the
next 30 years.

<HEAD>Court Refuses Stay on `Stock Baskets' at 3 Exchanges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals panel Thursday denied a request
by two Chicago futures exchanges to halt the sale of a new type of
security known as ``stock baskets'' at three competing exchanges.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision is the latest in
a 14-month series of legal and regulatory skirmishes between the
Securities and Exchange Commission and several of the exchanges.
   The so-called stock baskets, which allow investors to bet on the
direction of the stock market as a whole rather than purchasing
individual stocks, are currently being sold at the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange in New York.
   The product is called a Cash Index Participation in Philadelphia
and an Equity Participation Exchange at the Amex. When the SEC
approved the sale of stock baskets in March, it also included the
Chicago Board of Options Exchange in its decision.
   The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange _
the nation's two largest futures exchanges _ had asked the SEC to
delay its authorization of stock-basket products while their
lawsuit was being heard by the appeals court.
   While the lawsuit, which names the SEC as defendant, will
continue, a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit said in a brief
order that the stay was denied and set oral arguments in the case
for July 9.
   The BOT and Merc, which previously offered similar products and
likely would lose business to the stock-basket products, contend
the instruments are thinly disguised stock index futures and must
be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rather
than the SEC.

<HEAD>Firm Says Some Financial Statements Not Reliable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MiniScribe Corp. has advised stockholders
that the financial statements issued in fiscal 1986, 1987 and the
first three quarters of 1988 were not reliable, a company official
said Thursday.
   Shortly after the announcement, the rating firm Standard &amp;
Poor's suspended MiniScribe's B-rating on $98 million of
subordinated debt, saying it would be impossible to judge the
company's financial condition.
   While the troubled computer disc company made its May 15
interest payments on time, S&amp;P said ``the unavailability of audited
financial statements may trigger a technical default.''
   The developments are the latest in a string of problems
MiniScribe, which recently was force to furlough employees and is
the subject of two class-action lawsuits.
   MiniScribe Chairman Richard P. Rifenburgh said it is likely that
the company will be unable to produce reliable financial statements
for those periods because of the accounting controls in effect at
the time and the quality of existing records and documentation.
   In December, MiniScribe said it would lay off 2,000 people in
the company's plants here, in Singapore and in Hong Kong, citing a
slowdown in the market for computer disk drives.
   MiniScribe reported earnings of $25.9 million, or 65 cents a
share, for fiscal 1988, down from earnings of $31.1 million, or 82
cents per share in the previous fiscal year.
   The company also is facing two class-action lawsuits filed by
stockholders in U.S. District Court. Both complaints allege that
MiniScribe officials made ``false and misleading statements'' to
artificially inflate the company's stock.
   Rifenburgh said Thursday that the company will ask for a hearing
before the National Association of Securities Dealers in order to
maintain its NASDAQ listing.
