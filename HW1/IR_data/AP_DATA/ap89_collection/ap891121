   Japanese lumber mills are paying three or
four times U.S. prices, and trees worth millions of dollars cut
from national forests may be exported illegally each year at a cost
of American jobs.
   Northwest timber exports in 1988 were at least 4.3 billion
board-feet, up 20 percent from 1987. Most of that was legal _ cut
from private and state lands or, under limited authorization, from
national forests. But federal law requires that national forest
timber be milled in the United States.
   ``Since it's illegal, nobody really knows how much is going off
the docks. As a wild estimate, I would imagine that maybe 5 percent
might be federal logs. You're talking about $115 million to $120
million in lost revenue,'' said Chuck Sisco, a forester for the
National Audubon Society.
   Ted LaDoux, a spokesman for the Northwest Independent Forest
Manufacturers Association, disputes that estimate.
   ``There are people that have made claims that some are being
exported,'' he said. ``Our opinion is that, if it is occurring, it
is a real small percentage. We don't think it's a major problem.''
   But three men are awaiting trial in Montana on charges of
diverting more than 500,000 board-feet of national forest timber
for illegal export. And the U.S. Forest Service says it doesn't
know for sure how big the problem is; there are no full-time law
enforcement agents assigned to illegal export.
   ``We still don't have the blessing of the powers-that-be to go
ahead with it to any great extent,'' said John McCormick, an
investigator at the agency's office in Portland, Ore., adding that
Congress generally sets the priorities.
   ``They control the purse strings,'' McCormick said. ``During the
summer months, drugs are our priority. Practically everyone is
working on drugs, primarily marijuana growing.''
   Forest Service uncertainty over exports comes amid timber
shortages blamed for layoffs, sawmill closures and increased
industry-conservationist rancor.
   ``People could get killed out there'' if more trees aren't made
available, said a speaker at the annual meeting of the Montana Wood
Products Association.
   The region may suffer shortages at sawmills, but not at the
docks.
   Exports of raw logs from the Pacific Northwest to Pacific Rim
countries jumped from 3.7 billion board-feet in 1987 to 4.3 billion
board-feet in 1988, said U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. A fourth
of all trees cut in Oregon and Washington were exported in 1988, at
a cost of up to 30,530 mill jobs, he said.
   Roughly a fifth of the timber from the 12 Western states is
exported, the Western Wood Products Association says.
   The Audubon Society's Sisco said Commerce Department figures
used by the Forest Service frequently under-report log exports, and
he put the total at 5 billion board-feet. In Olympia, Wash., for
example, Audubon Society researchers found exports of 230 million
board-feet two years ago, while the Commerce Department and Forest
Service reported around 26 million board-feet, he said.
   Logs from federal lands are illegally included in the exports
since they add up to ``a lot of money very quickly,'' said Doug
Marke with the logs sitting there, people don't look.
   ``You're talking about a serious amount of money being lost,
either to the government or money being drained from the timber
industry,'' Marker said.
   Sisco said: ``It's such big money, that is why the big companies
have essentially closed their mills and they're into log exports
now _ the log exports bring so much more money than the lumber
would bring.''
   He said that the Japanese pay ``at least three and four times''
the U.S. market price and that political pressure has blocked
enforcement of the export ban on federal timber.
   Congressional pressure to enforce the ban ``is mounting,'' said
U.S. Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., who wants the annually renewed ban
made permanent. ``The most important reason why Congress has not
pressed on this is because, frankly, timber companies do not make
one peep in support of proper enforcement of the export ban law.
   ``The same timber company that will argue about job losses
because of environmental standards creates many, many times that
job loss due to their exporting logs, which also happens to be a
very profitable operation.''
   A General Accounting Office report on job loss and law
enforcement related to federal timber exports is due this month,
and a Senate Banking subcommittee held hearings Nov. 7 on proposals
by Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., to let states prohibit export of
state-owned logs and to make the federal ban permanent.
   ``Public lands should contribute to addressing public needs,''
Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt testified, adding there is a ``real
timber supply need in the Pacific Northwest right now.''
   ``Timber that is harvested from our federal and state lands can
make an important contribution to meeting this need,'' he said.
``Limiting exports is one positive way to do this while protecting
other non-timber resources and saving American jobs.''
   DeFazio and Williams have introduced companion measures in the
House.
   The state-timber bill would legitimize Alaska, Oregon,
California and Idaho laws requiring in-state processing of logs,
said a Packwood aide, Jon Stephens.
   Meanwhile, in what prosecutors believe is the first trial of its
kind, three Washington men are to go on trial Nov. 20 in Helena on
charges of conspiring to export unprocessed federal logs to Japan.
John Tortorelli of Bellevue, Winston Bentley of Spokane and Roger
Britz of Orting were indicted on charges in the shipment of 558,515
board-feet of timber from national forest in Montana.
   ``There are only so many logs for our mills,'' said U.S.
Attorney Pete Dunbar. ``If they are exporting logs illegally
doesn't that take away from the capability of Montana mills?''

<TEXT>
   Were it not for one violent day
in 1985, Evelina de Bruin would be like countless other black South
African women: an illiterate maid in her 50s, raised in a isolated
farming district, mother of 10.
   Today, she is the only woman on Death Row _ alone, confused and
ill. Her prison cell in Pretoria is the farthest she's ever been
from home.
   ``She cannot eat, she can't sleep,'' said her lawyer, Andrea
Durbach of Cape Town. ``It's a very dramatic thing to say, but I
used to think to myself that she's just going to die of a broken
heart.''
   Mrs. de Bruin and 13 men were sentenced to death in May for the
mob killing in November 1985 of a black policeman, Lucas Sethwala,
in Paballelo, the black section of the remote northwestern town of
Upington.
   Twenty-six people were tried for the killing, and four men were
found to have physically contributed to the death of Sethwala, who
was chased from his home, stoned, beaten and set afire.
   In addition to those four, Mrs. de Bruin and nine others were
convicted of murder under the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which
holds them responsible because they were part of the crowd that
sought to kill Sethwala.
   Sethwala's death occurred at a time of nationwide black unrest.
Hours before he was slain several thousand blacks gathered at a
soccer field in Paballelo to protest rent increases and other
grievances.
   After police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, about 300 people
re-grouped around Sethwala's home and threw stones to force him
outside.
   Militant blacks have frequently attacked black policemen,
accusing them of collaborating with the government and its
apartheid policies.
   Mrs. de Bruin and her common-law husband, who also has been
sentenced to death, were identified as having thrown stones at
Sethwala's house. According to the state's evidence, she allegedly
yelled: ``The dog is in the house. Bring him out and burn him
alive.''
   Mrs. de Bruin testified during the trial that she and her
husband went back to their own house after the protest meeting was
broken up and were not present at Sethwala's home.
   Mrs. de Bruin, who had no previous criminal record and worked
for the same white family for 30 years, has little understanding of
what is happening to her, Ms. Durbach said.
   Mrs. de Bruin suffers from arthritis, heart disease and has high
blood pressure, the lawyer said. She does not know in what city her
prison is and thinks she's been imprisoned for at least a year,
when in fact it has been six months.
   She sees her husband for 30 minutes, once a month. They are
separated by a window and communicate through microphones. Only
three of her 10 children have been able to visit her, Ms. Durbach
said.
   Because she cannot read and is too ill to exercise, Mrs. de
Bruin does little but listen to government-run radio that is piped
into her cell, said Ms. Durbach, who visits her every three weeks.
   She has been treated well by the prison staff and has developed
a good relationship with one of the guards, Ms. Durbach added.
   A judge ruled in September that the 14 people sentenced to death
could appeal their sentences, but a bail request for Mrs. de Bruin
was turned down.
   Two psychologists testified at her bail application that she had
suffered mental and physical deterioration, including memory loss,
since her imprisonment.
   Ms. Durbach said no date has been set for the appeal, but she
hopes it could be early next year.
   In a similar mob killing, the Appeal Court, the country's
highest court, last year upheld under the ``common purpose''
doctrine the death sentence of six blacks known as the
``Sharpeville Six.''
   However, after a storm of domestic and international protest,
then-President P.W. Botha commuted their death sentences to lengthy
prison terms.
   The last woman to be executed in South Africa was Sandra Smith,
25, who was of mixed race. She was hanged in June after being
convicted of joining her boyfriend in the brutal knife murder of a
teen-ager.
   More than 50 people, mostly black, have been executed so far
this year, and more than 100 were hanged in each of the previous
three years.
   Botha and his successor, F.W. de Klerk, have commuted 54 death
sentences this year.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A massive offensive left no
doubt about the Salvadoran guerrillas' military capacity and drove
home their point that serious negotiations and government
concessions are necessary to end the 10-year-old civil war.
   And the killings of six Jesuit priests during the offensive
galvanized opposition in the United States to continued aid for the
rightist Salvadoran administration, which must be considered plus
for the leftist rebels.
   But the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front paid a high
price for its achievements. They turned densely populated urban
districts into battlefields, and the lives of tens of thousands of
workers became a weeklong nightmare of death and destruction.
   Residents of Soyapango, Zacamil, Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado,
the humble neighborhoods devastated by the fighting that began Nov.
11, were angry at a government that sent warplanes to strafe and
bomb guerrilla positions amid their homes.
   But those same residents seem to have saved most of their
resentment for the rebels.
   ``We just want `the boys' to leave, so we can go back to work
and finish raising our children,'' said Porfirio Alvarez as he fled
with his wife and two daughters from Zacamil.
   The guerrillas maintained fortified positions in and around a
complex of low-income apartment blocks there for four days.
Virtually the entire non-combatant population evacuated under fire.
   When it appeared most of the civilians had left, government
forces subjected Zacamil to a six-hour barrage of bazookas, rockets
and cannon fire that left the complex smoldering and practically
ruined.
   ``I know women whose sons are with the guerrillas, and I see how
they worry about their children and suffer when they are killed.
They're human too. But because of them, we almost get killed. If
they would not have come, this would not have happened,'' said
Marta Rodriguez, sweeping her arm across her humble cinderblock
Soyapango home hit by bullets and shrapnel.
   It is difficult to imagine that the rebels made many converts in
neighborhoods where the fighting was heaviest, but guerrilla chief
Facundo Guardado, interviewed at his command post near Mejicanos,
said the display of strength, organization and morale was
motivating adolescent men and women to ``incorporate themselves''
into the struggle.
   ``I hold the FMLN in high regard professionally,'' retired U.S.
Army Gen. Fred Woerner told The Associated Press last week.
   The war ``cannot be resolved militarily,'' said Woerner, who
drew up a strategic plan for the war in 1981 and was head of the
U.S. Southern Command in Panama until the end of September.
   Woerner said the guerrillas cannot be overcome until the roots
of war _ unfair distribution of wealth and pervasive social
injustice _ are addressed.
   In what appears to have been a response to the insurgent push, a
squad of assassins murdered and mutilated six Jesuit priests and
educators considered leftist ideologues by the country's rabid
right.
   Two witnesses, who for the moment remain in hiding, reportedly
saw men in army uniform commit the massacre.
   ``The time has arrived for President (Alfredo) Cristiani to make
good on his promise to control those officials in his government
and in his party who in a good measure are responsible for the
civil war,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said after the
slayings.
   ``In a time of reduced foreign aid, we must ask ourselves what
it is we are achieving with the dollars we send,'' said Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass.
   But President Bush said the United States should not ``undermine
a fragile democracy'' by withdrawing aid, and on Monday the House
voted narrowly against restricting military aid. But the debate was
bitter and at times personal, and the issue had clearly become
controversial again.
   The United States has provided more than $3.5 billion in
economic and military aid to a succession of Salvadoran governments
this decade. It is generally conceded, even by U.S. officials, that
the rebels would have won the war by 1985 had it not been for
massive U.S. assistance.
   The guerrillas said this year they are willing to abandon armed
struggle and convert the FMLN into a political party in exchange
for sweeping political, economic and social reform.
   Rebel and government representatives sat down together in
September and October to try to find a way toward peace.
   The government rejected the possibility of fundamental overhaul
of the reigning system and limited its negotiating position to a
demand that that the rebels lay down their arms and join ``the
democratic process.''
   When a bomb killed 10 unionists at a leftist labor federation,
the rebels broke off talks.
   Pope John Paul II late last week issued a call for truce and an
exhortation to both sides to resume peace talks.
   Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, said
both sides have agreed in principle to heed the Pope's call and to
accept the church as mediator.
   ``But the means of working this out are complicated and causing
us a lot of work,'' Rosa Chavez said Sunday.
   The rebel offensive against the capital appeared all but over by
early this week. It did not bring down the Cristiani government,
but left it shaken.
   With the capital and several provincial cites besieged and
paralyzed and a protracted standoff apparently the best the armed
forces could manage, leaders of the country's business and
industrial sectors reportedly talked with military and political
elements about replacing the government with a provisional regime.
   Diplomats said discussion of such a change, whether peacefully
or by a coup, was preliminary, a kind of worst-case contingency.
But that it was talked about at all is another indication the
guerrillas delivered a telling blow.

<TEXT>
   A night's stay costs $160 if you use the
hot tub, and summer reservations must be made months in advance,
but once you're at Rockwell Lighthouse, the price and the wait seem
a bargain.
   The privacy of the island lighthouse, its 360-degree view of
Sitka Sound and the peaceful symphony of waves and sea birds are
enough to warm even the coldest of hearts.
   Since it was completed in 1985, Rockwell Lighthouse _ really a
house although it does have a navigation light for sailors _ has
been the site of 14 weddings, dozens of honeymoons and ``bunches of
affairs,'' says owner Burgess Bauder.
   Bauder built it because he loves lighthouses and couldn't figure
what else to do with Rockwell Island, a three-quarter-acre clump of
rock, spruce and driftwood less than a mile from Sitka's waterfront.
   He bought the island on speculation in 1973 for $3,000, then a
decade later was unable to sell it at a profit. ``Thank God we
didn't, because this has turned out better than any business
venture,'' he said.
   Bauder, the town veterinarian and an occasional carpenter, began
building the four-story, wood-frame structure in 1983. An architect
provided a scale drawing in exchange for Bauder spaying his dog.
Except for some help with the framing, Bauder did all the
construction himself.
   The project raised some eyebrows in this scenic Southeast Alaska
fishing port and mill town about 90 miles south of Juneau.
   ``There were three people who through the grapevine told me that
it was a potential eyesore because it was visible from all over
town,'' Bauder recalled. ``And now it's the most photographed home
in Sitka.''
   In spite of virtually no advertising, Rockwell Lighthouse also
has become the most hard-to-get overnight lodging in the Alaska
Panhandle. It's open year-round, but summer reservations are
recommended four to five months in advance. Most of next August
already is booked.
   Although the lighthouse was built primarily as a romantic
getaway, its little red beacon does aid mariners entering the
island-studded sound. The Coast Guard even commissioned the
building in July 1985, making it sort of an honorary lighthouse.
   The white-and-red lighthouse is a cozy escape from Sitka's
weather, which usually is wet and cool even in summer. The interior
walls are covered with cedar, black walnut, hemlock, fir. The
spiral lattice staircase is handmade of Philippine mahogany.
   ``It's a cut above rustic,'' Bauder said modestly.
   There are all the amenities of home except a television. Don't
even think of asking Bauder if you can bring one.
   ``I say if you want to watch television, why even go out there?
The background music with the stereo system is an imperative to me,
but the visual? You're inundated with the visual everywhere you
look,'' Bauder said.
   The entire lighthouse rents for $125 per night for up to five
people. The hot tub is an extra $35.
   Above the round living room is the tower with three small
bedrooms, including an intimate cupola room with 10 picture windows
affording the 360-degree view.
   The lighthouse boosted Bauder's reputation for being somewhat
eccentric, a description he savors.
   ``For sure,'' he said. ``Eccentric _ away from the center. But
that's not by design. That's just who I am.''
   The success of his island retreat has exceeded even Bauder's
expectations.
   ``It is a romantic place,'' he said. ``It is private, it is
beautiful. At the risk of paraphrasing John Denver, it fills up
your senses.''
   In the living room is a collection of guest books, filled with
the remembrances of hundreds of visitors.
   They tell of sunny views of volcanic Mount Edgecumbe, of nights
spent weathering violent winter storms. Gushing newlyweds declare
their love with words and little hearts. Would-be poets try their
hand at verse.
   ``We cannot tell you how much we enjoyed our stay _ the fog, the
beautiful views, the eagle-watching,'' a Florida couple wrote.
   ``When we're back home in the terrible heat, we'll think of July
in Sitka with the fireplace roaring.''

<TEXT>
   Palestinian youths,
unseen behind a row of tin-roofed shanties, showered a squad of
Israeli soldiers with stones and taunted them with curses.
   The Israelis, encumbered with automatic rifles, riot helmets and
tear gas canisters, lumbered around a corner in pursuit, but the
teen-agers had vanished.
   Musing about the elusiveness of the Palestinians, Brig. Gen.
Ehud Gross chose a quotation from Shakespeare's ``Macbeth'': ``The
earth has bubbles ... whither are they vanished?''
   The soldiers' frustration at such encounters became quickly
apparent as Gross, the army's chief education officer, gathered a
dozen troops under a tree to talk about army orders limiting the
use of force in battling the Palestinian uprising.
   ``I think our hands are tied. You cannot do anything. You don't
fire because you're not allowed to,'' said Pvt. Eitan, 21, cradling
his riot helmet as he leaned on his Galil rifle.
   Defending the orders not to fire on stone throwers unless their
lives were in danger, Gross asked, ``So, what's wrong with that?''
   ``You don't capture anyone. All day long you go around and
around and you don't catch anyone,'' said Eitan, whose full name
could not be used in keeping with army regulations.
   As he spoke, stones smacked into the dirt near the gathering,
first singly, then in flurries. Two soldiers stepped out of the
semicircle and gave chase. They returned empty-handed. All the
while there was whistling, which is used by Palestinian lookouts to
signal that soldiers were in the camp.
   Gross asked if the soldiers believed they should be given more
freedom to respond and what the consequences might be?
   A soldier wearing sunglasses argued that troublemakers _ ``those
who deserve it'' _ should be punished, even beaten.
   ``I'm not saying shoot to kill but make it seriously painful for
them and not give them two slaps on the face,'' he said.
   The army recently allowed soldiers to open fire with live
ammunition against masked Palestinian activists who refused orders
to halt. But most stone-throwers don't wear masks.
   Other soldiers protested that tougher action would only increase
the hostility of the population, escalate violence and undermine
the morality of the army.
   ``They are limitations (on the use of force) because that's how
we were educated. We were not educated to kill, especially women
and children,'' said one soldier. ``We are a moral army.''
   In the course of the two-year uprising, 615 Palestinians have
been killed in encounters with Israelis, and 42 Israelis have been
slain by Palestinians. Thousands on both sides have been wounded.
   Gross said pent-up desires for revenge were natural.
   ``It's not a shame to be angry and feel a tremendous urge to
beat someone. But it's important to control yourself,'' he said.
   No matter what political solution emerged, Gross said, Israelis
and Palestinians would have to live together. ``We have to try to
avoid the expansion of circles of hate,'' he said.
   During the uprising, 530 officers and soldiers out of nearly
100,000 who have served in the occupied lands have been disciplined
for overstepping the often-ambiguous limits on the use of force,
army officials say.
   Punishment, criticized by liberals for being inadequate, has
ranged from loss of pay, vacation or rank to a maximum jail term of
two years.
   A captain, speaking at a Gaza Strip military base, unbuttoned
his shirt pocket to reveal a wad of written orders. One booklet
stresses soldiers have ``no right to use force in order to punish''
and that army units should not humiliate the Arab population or
damage property.
   The captain, also named Eitan, conceded some violations go
unreported because officers are reluctant to undermine morale by
reporting the misdeeds of their soldiers.
   ``Basically, we rely on the humanity of the soldiers and the
commanders,'' he said.
   During the three-hour patrol in the Beach Camp, where 41,000
Palestinian refugees live along the sandy Mediterranean shoreline,
soldiers walked dirt streets alongside open sewers and squeezed
down passageways so narrow they couldn't carry their rifles
sideways.
   The patrol first encountered hostile looks, then stones and
curses. The soldiers aimed their rifles threateningly but did not
fire.
   Before the patrol began, there were no signs of unrest and the
open-air market was jammed with shoppers.
   ``The calm appears real, but in fact (the Palestinians) had
created a private army inside, with masked people walking around in
the daylight. They started to run the daily life and soon they
would have appeared with weapons,'' said Lt. Col. Bouzi, a unit
commander interviewed in a tent encampment nearby.
   He said his soldiers had wounded 30 Palestinians with plastic
bullets in efforts to establish order during the unit's first week
in Beach Camp. He also criticized a previous unit that refrained
from entering the camp because of the outward calm.
   ``With all due respect to the quiet, if you don't get in once or
twice a day and show them that we can go there whenever we want,
they will take the initiative.''

   A woman charged with killing her
5-year-old daughter by giving her a heroin substitute to stop
persistent coughing was ordered to undergo evaluation at the state
Institute of Mental Health.
   Chief Judge Albert E. DeRobbio of District Court on Monday also
set Nov. 27 as a bail hearing for Carol Taylor, 41, of Providence.
   Police said Taylor gave methadone to her daughter, Shanna,
because she was irritated with the child's cough.
   Taylor told police she gave Shanna 10 milligrams of the drug
Friday because a friend told her it would help the girl's cold.
Shanna died later in the day.
   Taylor was undergoing counseling at a treatment center for drug
addicts, according to court papers. She received the methadone from
the center as a ``weekend dose,'' she told police.
   Like heroin, methadone is a depressant narcotic that slows the
heart and respiratory system. Gerry Schwab, a spokesman at the
Rhode Island Poison Center said a normal adult dose is from 2{ to
10 milligrams.

   The respected French daily Le Monde has agreed to
loan an old rotary printing press to the independent Polish daily
Gazeta Wyborcza free of charge for a decade.
   Adam Michnik, editor of the Warsaw paper that began publishing
in May and now has a circulation of 500,000, signed the contract
Monday with Andre Fontaine, editor of Le Monde.
   The French paper revised its format last September and began
printing at an ultra-modern facility in a Paris suburb. Under the
agreement, Le Monde also will loan Gazeta Wyborcza some modern
photogravure equipment.
   The old press, capable of printing up to 55,000 copies an hour,
served Le Monde for more than 25 years. The $300,000 cost of
dismantling and moving the machine to Warsaw will be paid for
through a special subscription drive.
   Before signing the contract, Michnik pinned a Solidarity pin on
Fontaine's lapel and the French editor recalled an article Michnik
had written for the Paris daily when Solidarity was outlawed.

   President Bush told a elementary school class
Monday that some of the ``fun stuff'' he gets to do for being
leader of the free world includes getting his picture snapped with
famous football players.
   On this occasion, the location was Washington. The team was
Denver. The famous player was Broncos quarterback John Elway.
   Later, in a meeting with fifth graders at Pickard Elementary
School in Chicago, Bush was asked how he liked being president.
   ``You know what I got to do? Some of the boys are going to be
interested. Just before I came here, I got to meet the quarterback
for the Denver Broncos Football Team and I know Mike Ditka (Chicago
Bears coach) ... so I get some fun stuff to do in sports.''
   Also attending the picture-taking session were Bronocs owner Pat
Bowlen, general manager John Beake, coach Dan Reeves and defensive
safety Dennis Smith.
   With Elway sitting out the game because of an attack of stomach
flu, the Broncos defeated the Washington Redskins 14-10 Monday
night in Washington.

<HEAD>Bocuse, Robuchon and Girardet Named ``Chefs of Century.''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Superstar French chefs Paul Bocuse and Joel
Robuchon, and the Swiss Fredy Girardet have been named ``chefs of
the century'' by the Gault-Millau guidebook.
   The honor also was a return to grace for Bocuse because the
quide gave him back his fourth toque or chef's hat. The toque is
Gault-Millau's symbol for excellence and Bocuse was demoted to
three toques by last year's guide.
   According to the guidebook's president and editor, Christian
Millau, Bocuse's problem last year was turning out the same basic
menu for years, while other chefs were getting ahead with new ideas.
   Known as the ``emperor of cuisine,'' Bocuse also was criticized
for travelling around the world rather than tending to his stock
pots at his restaurant near Lyon.
   Bocuse accused Millau of always bringing his dog to the
restaurant and not asking for the bill. But the spat simmered down
as Millau and Bocuse kissed and made up.
   ``I was very happy to be named a chef of the century, and we've
settled our differences,'' said Bocuse. ``But the century isn't
over yet,'' he added. ``I think there's room for more of us up
there.''
   He said he was flattered to be in the company of two legendary
chefs who were posthumously named ``chefs of the century:'' Auguste
Escoffier and Fernand Point. ``Escoffier was the master of us
all,'' said Bocuse. ``And Point was the first chef-owner, who ran
his own show. Before that chefs were hidden away, as restaurants
were owned by maitre d's or entrepreneurs.''
   ``Bocuse deserves his place at the top,'' said Millau, who said
his guidebook was celebrating its 20th anniversary. ``He is an
exceptional personality who has done more than anybody else to
promote French cuisine abroad.''
   ``But I consider Robochon and Girardet more creative and
visionary chefs,'' added Millau. ``Especially Robuchon, who has
known how to marry traditional cuisine with new tastes.''
   Robuchon made quite a name for himself by bringing back the
mashed potato as a gourmet favorite _ on menus with other
specialties like sweet-sour ``migononettes'' of venison and hot
foie gras with cream of lentils.
   All three ``chefs of the century'' are regularly awarded the top
three stars in the Michelin, considered the bible of guidebooks.
   Gault-Millau, nearly as well-known in France as the Michelin,
has a circulation of about 200,000 versus 720,000 for the Michelin,
the venerable guidebook that was first published in 1900.
   Gault-Millau is avidly read for its picturesque and peppery
commentaries, a different style from the Michelin, whose terse
listing is a very serious reference for gastronomes in a country
that takes its gastronomy seriously.
   At least 1,200 French chefs and 15,000 guests packed an
exhibition hall last week at the futuristic La Defense area west of
Paris for the Gault-Millau awards followed by a tasting of regional
food and wines.
   ``I have special prizes for our top chefs,'' announced Millau,
``provided they promise not to eat them.'' He presented each with a
live Bresse rooster, a symbol of France raised in the region known
for producing its most succulent poultry. Bocuse looked his fowl
right in the eye, claiming to hypnotize it.
   In the highest category of four toques and a grade of 19.5 out
of 20 Gault-Millau listed 13 restaurants for 1990, adding three new
establishments: the Auberge de l'Eridon at Annecy, the Auberge de
l'Ill, at Illhaeusern in Alsace and the Cote d'Or at Saulieu in
Burgundy country.
   No restaurants fell from the four-toque category this year, but
three famous gourmet meccas were demoted from three toques to two:
Le Grand Vefour, Laurent and La Maree, all in Paris.

<HEAD>Farmer Turns to Turkeys for Added Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WELDON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkeys are topical right now, but farmers
say America's growing preoccupation with health has turned the
birds into a year-round money-maker.
   Gary Twist, who has 8,000 Toms fattening up for market, says
he's learned turkeys are quite a bit smarter than most people think.
   ``They're very sociable ... docile and interested when people
come in here,'' said Twist. ``The old wives' tales we heard weren't
true _ they're intelligent and we enjoy them.''
   So do consumers. Per capita consumption of turkeys has risen
from 8.5 pounds in 1975 to 17 pounds a year in 1989.
   ``People are seeing turkey as a healthy, economical alternative
to red meat,'' said Laurie Wilson of the National Turkey
Federation. ``There also are a lot more products available, and
that's what people want _ variety and convenience.''
   Whole turkeys still are popular for holidays like Thanksgiving
and Christmas, but the real growth in the turkey industry has been
with products like turkey ham, hot dogs, sausage, bacon and fresh
breast cutlets.
   Farmers raised 164 million turkeys in the United States in 1982,
and the flock increased to 255 million birds this year.
   Twist, whose turkeys end up in hospital meals and fast-food
turkey sandwiches, expects to raise about 80,000 of the birds this
year.
   The Twist family has been farming in DeWitt County since 1852.
Chickens were added to the grain farm in 1969 and commercial egg
production began in 1973. Twist said turkeys seemed a perfect way
to balance the fluctuations in egg and grain markets.
   ``It's one area of our business where we don't have to listen to
the noon news to see if we're profitable,'' said Twist, who raises
the turkeys for Trevcam, a company based in Forrest.
   Young turkeys hatched by the company are shipped to Twist's
starter building, where they are fed and kept warm for eight weeks.
They then move to the two 50- by 480-foot finishing buildings,
where they eat a corn-soybean mixture, reaching market weight of
about 27 pounds in a total of 18 weeks.
   They are slaughtered and processed in Indiana.
   Twist said he is paid 9 cents a pound for the finished birds,
and it costs about 3 cents to raise them.

<TEXT>
   Disney's ``The Little Mermaid'' slithered by
MGM-UA's ``All Dogs Go to Heaven'' at the box office last weekend
in the animation showdown of the year.
   The weekend's top film, though, was Eddie Murphy's
self-congratulatory ``Harlem Nights,'' according to figures
released Monday.
   ``The Little Mermaid,'' which some critics have labeled an
instant classic, finished in third place in its premiere weekend,
setting a record for an animated film with a per-screen average of
$6,068 a theater, Disney said.
   Its opening weekend of $6.1 million was 50 percent better than
last year's ``Oliver and Co.,'' which became the all-time
top-grossing animated film with a domestic gate of $53.3 million.
   Disney said half of ``Mermaid's'' viewers were adults and
teen-agers unaccompanied by children.
   ``Harlem Nights,'' which bears the distinction of mentioning its
star's name five times in the opening credits, was the
third-biggest Thanksgiving-Christmas release ever, taking in $16.1
million last weekend.
   The biggest fall films are ``Rocky IV,'' which debuted with $20
million in 1985 and ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,'' which
collected $16.9 million in 1986.
   Overall business for last weekend's top 10 films was $52
million, up 47 percent from a year ago, Entertainment Data Inc.
said.
   ``Look Who's Talking,'' the love-over-diapers comedy featuring
John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and the voice of Bruce Willis, landed
in second last weekend with $8.5 million. Down 25 percent from the
previous week, ``Look Who's Talking'' nonetheless passed $85
million.
   The ensemble drama ``Steel Magnolias'' finished in fourth with
$5.4 million and a strong per-screen average of $11,303 in a
somewhat limited release. The film stars Dolly Parton, Sally Field
and Shirley MacLaine, among others.
   In fifth was ``All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' the new animated film
from Don Bluth. Featuring the voice of Burt Reynolds, ``All Dogs''
opened to $4.7 million. Its per-screen average was $2,988.
   ``Dad,'' the drama starring Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson, fell 30
percent to sixth place on receipts of $3.1 million. In seventh was
``Prancer,'' the story of a wounded reindeer who may _ or may not _
be traveling with a big guy in a red suit. ``Prancer'' grossed $2.9
million.
   ``The Bear'' was eighth with $2.8 million; ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors'' finished ninth with $1.5 million; and ``Staying
Together'' plummeted to 10th with $939,208, down 54 percent from
last week.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by
Entertainment Data and Exhibitor Relations Co. Figures are based on
a combination of actual box-office receipts and studio projections
where actual figures are not immediately available.
   1. ``Harlem Nights,'' Paramount, $16.1 million weekend gross,
2,180 screens, $7,384 per screen, $16.1 million total gross, one
week in release.
   2. ``Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $8.5 million, 1,651
screens, $5,171 per screen, $85.1 million, six weeks.
   3. ``The Little Mermaid,'' Disney, $6.1 million, 994 screens,
$6,068 per screen, $6.1 million, one week.
   4. ``Steel Magnolias,'' Tri-Star, $5.4 million, 480 screens,
$11,303 per screen, $5.4 million, one week.
   5. ``All Dogs Go to Heaven,'' MGM-UA, $4.7 million, 1,577
screens, $2,988 per screen, $4.7 million, one week.
   6. ``Dad,'' Universal, $3.1 million, 1,123 screens, $2,800 per
screen, $10.8 million, four weeks.
   7. ``Prancer,'' Orion, $2.9 million, 1,713 screens, $1,701 per
screen, $2.9 million, one week.
   8. ``The Bear,'' Tri-Star, $2.8 million, 1,054 screens, $2,648
per screen, $20.1 million, four weeks.
   9. ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' Orion, $1.5 million, 503
screens, $2,884 per screen, $11.1 million, six weeks.
   10. ``Staying Together,'' Hemdale, $939,208, 1,004 screens, $935
per screen, $3.4 million, two weeks.

   Willard Warwick doesn't need a calendar to
know when report cards are out at Chetopa Grade School. Within
hours, pupils are lined up at his store.
   For the past 28 years, he has handed out bags of apples at his
grocery store in this southeast Kansas town of 1,700 people for
pupils from kindergarten to eighth grade who receive an ``A'' in
math.
   ``It's appreciation for the kids who have worked hard in math,''
he said. ``A lot of kids have worked pretty hard to get a bag of
those apples.''
   Warwick estimates he gives away 120 pounds of apples each
quarter _ 480 pounds a year. By Christmas, Warwick will have given
away more than 6.5 tons of apples to students over the years.
   The first year he gave away the apples, Warwick's daughter was
in the first grade. Now Cynda Jarrett is the mother of two
apple-winning children and the school's second-grade teacher.
   Her son, Lucas, a kindergartner, was one of the newest apple
winners. He was nonchalant about his A when his mother asked him
how he earned the high mark.
   ``Don't ask me. I don't know. Ask my brain,'' he said.

   Victor Stello Jr. will get another chance in
January to plead his case to head the government's nuclear weapons
production program, following the Bush administration's failure to
win quick Senate confirmation.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee announced Monday it would
not act on the nomination before the holiday recess, which is
expected to start before Thanksgiving.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said more time was
needed to analyze newly received documentation on Stello, who
appeared before the panel last Wednesday. Nunn said further
hearings on Stello would be held after Congress returns Jan. 22.
   ``We have an incomplete record now,'' Nunn said.
   Stello did not return a reporter's telephone call Monday after
Nunn's announcement.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, in an unusual personal appeal
to the committee at Stello's confirmation hearing last week, said
he urgently needed a confirmed chief of nuclear weapons production
to carry out needed reforms.
   In a statement issued on Monday, Watkins said Stello's
nomination was ``one of my top priorities'' and said he expected
him to be confirmed when Congress reconvenes.
   ``I am certain that additional hearings will prove that the
accusations raised in the waning hours of this session are those
same accusations investigated years ago and resolved,'' Watkins
said.
   There was no indication Monday whether the White House would
install Stello in the job temporarily for one year by making an
appointment while Congress is in recess.
   Stello said last week he told Watkins he would prefer not to
accept a temporary appointment.
   Stello's opponents, led by Democratic Sens. Timothy Wirth of
Colorado and John Glenn of Ohio, believe Stello is not sufficiently
committed to nuclear safety. Stello strongly denied this and vowed
to carry out Watkins' orders to improve management of the nuclear
weapons complex.
   Some committee Republicans, including Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, have accused Democrats of politically motivated delay
tactics in order to kill the nomination. But Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the panel, said Monday the decision
to hold further hearings was a ``fallback procedure.''
   This should not be interpreted ``as a weakness in support ... in
this nominee's chances of winning confirmation,'' Warner said,
adding he did not expect the January hearings to ``produce anything
new that we haven't heard'' about Stello.
   Greenpeace U.S.A., an environmental group that has spearheaded a
campaign to defeat the nomination, praised the committee's decision
to postpone a vote.
   ``We managed to beat back enormous White House pressure'' to
quickly confirm Stello, said Stephen Schwartz, the Greenpeace
legislative coordinator. ``It's the right move by the committee.''
   Stello technically is still employed by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, where he holds the title of executive director of
operations. But he has been working full-time for Watkins since
July as an adviser on preparations for the restart of the
department's idled Savannah River nuclear reactors.

   Soprano Ruth Welting, not heard at the
Metropolitan Opera since its 1981-'82 season, returned to sing a
part she sang that season, Olympia, the mechanical doll in
Offenbach's ``The Tales of Hoffmann.''
   She was a delight, singing the coloratura lightly, beautifully
and acting amusingly, charmingly.
   Miss Welting's doll doesn't stay in the same mood throughout Act
1. She gets increasingly aggressive, flailing her arms at people,
swinging Hoffmann too fast in the dance, then clasping her hands
around his neck to swing him, in a veritable stranglehold.
   Sometimes, the Met casts the same soprano in all of Hoffmann's
tales. The most recent was Dame Joan Sutherland. On Monday night,
in the opera's first presentation this season, three women sang the
parts.
   Luis Lima was singing Hoffmann for the first time at the Met.
Hoffmann's voice should be produced fully, with strong tone and
resonance. Lima did that, but in Act 1 he sometimes seemed to be
trying to make up for difficult high notes by increasing volume. In
Act 2, he sounded vocally strained and tired, but he didn't sound
tired anymore in Act 3. Altogether, it was a good job.
   Diana Montague, from Winchester, United Kingdom, who made her
Met debut in 1987, was splendid as Hoffmann's friend Nicklausse. In
men's clothes, she still looked feminine, but that didn't matter.
Her singing was clear, flexible and appealing.
   Jose van Dam sang all four villains. He sang well but chose a
path of subtlety which meant the audience missed the malevolence
which makes the opera chilling. This especially was evident in his
aria in Venice, presented by the Met _ but not everywhere _ as Act
2.
   Judith Forst of New Westminster, British Columbia, sang
Giulietta, the Venice courtesan. She sang well but didn't sound
seductive.
   The third act's Antonia, originally announced to be Judith
Blegen, was sung by Myra Merritt of Washington, D.C. Her voice is
lovely, but she didn't build the drama of this most dramatic of the
tales.
   Both Miss Forst and Miss Merritt sounded more like singers being
serious than like the characters they portrayed.
   Donald Kaasch, a native of Denver, made his Met debut as the
physicist in Act 1. He sounds like a tenor of much promise and,
despite his white Einstein wig, capered with unusually youthful
agility, adding to the act's merriment.
   Sylvain Cambreling of Amiens, France, conducted, and the
orchestra sounded marvelous.
   This production was new in 1982. Act 1 is in a big room with a
magical back wall of perpetual motion machines, but Acts 2 and 3
are gloomy. Act 3 is even darker than at first. No longer can the
picture of Antonia's mother be seen to become a real person who
sings. Now it becomes darker and singing comes from that direction.

<HEAD>Chemical Industry Group Says Fungicides Help Keep Prices Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ban on the use of crop fungicides would
cause consumer food prices to rise by 13 percent and the supply of
fruits, vegetables and peanuts to decline by 24 percent, a farm
chemical trade association says.
   No total ban on fungicides has been proposed, and the
Environmental Protection Agency said none is in the works.
   But Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, said he wanted to call attention to the ``enormous
benefit and the very small risk'' that result from the use of
fungicides and other high-tech farming methods on food supplies.
   ``In my view, the debate regarding the safety of our food is
almost totally risk-dominated,'' Vroom said. ``There is precious
little mentioned about the benefit side of the equation.''
   An economic study showing the effects of a ban on fungicides _
chemicals applied to crops, particularly fruit and vegetable, to
prevent plant diseases _ was released by the association at a news
conference Monday.
   The study, paid for by the association, was done by GRC
Economics, a Washington, D.C., consulting subsidiary of Hill and
Knowlton Inc.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's spokesman on pesticides,
Al Heier, commented, ``We have always been concerned about
fungicides, but we're not going to cancel all of them.'' He noted
federal law requires the agency to balance benefits against risks
when judging any pesticides and said the agency adheres to that
mandate.
   John M. Urbanchuk, senior vice president and director of
economics for the consulting firm, said, ``If fungicides were
eliminated, you the consumer would pay more for lower-quality
produce. You would find that many fruits and vegetables no longer
look or taste the same as before, and they would cost much more.''
   For example, he said, crops hit hardest with price increases
would include popular salad bar items such as carrots, which would
rise 80 percent; lettuce, 40 percent; tomatoes, 40 percent; and
onions, 34 percent.
   Prices of other major crops also would go up sharply, he said.
Peanuts and peanut butter would rise 68 percent; peaches, 37
percent; and potatoes, 37 percent.
   ``Some foods may not be available at all,'' Urbanchuk said. ``If
fungicides were no longer used by American farmers, consumers would
not have bananas to slice on their morning meal, and children may
not have peanut butter for their lunch sandwiches.''
   Production of fruits would decline by 32 percent, vegetables by
21 percent, peanuts by 68 percent, and the major grains such as
corn and wheat by 6 percent, he said.
   Urbanchuk said in his statement that poorer families would
suffer the most by not being able to afford higher prices for
fruits and vegetables.
   Lisa Lefferts of the Center for Science in the Public Interest
said she had not studied the chemical industry's report and had no
comment on the study's specific figures.
   But, she said, the current way of growing food with large
amounts of fungicides and other chemicals ``isn't the only way to
do it.'' In fact, she added, the National Academy of Sciences
recently reported on alternate ways of farming to reduce the
contamination of soil, water and air by cutting back on chemicals.
   ``We're confident, and so is the National Academy of Sciences,
that we can produce foods profitably and competitively using far
fewer fungicides and other pesticides,'' Lefferts said in a
telephone interview.
   ``The most telling statistic would be not how much reduced
fungicide use would cost consumers, but how much it would cost the
chemical industry,'' she said.
   Fungicides represent about $370 million or 7.4 percent of the $5
billion-a-year farm chemicals industry, association officials said.
   An advisory board for the study included representatives of the
association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, National
Food Processors Association, Fertilizer Institute, Resources for
the Future and the Agriculture Department.

   James Cason, turned away by the Senate for a
top environmental job in the Bush administration, has asked the
White House to withdraw his nomination.
   The action effectively ends an eight-month battle between
President Bush and environmentalists over the controversial nominee
for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and
the environment.
   ``Withdrawal of this nomination is a great disappointment,''
said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who announced Cason's
request on Monday. ``The lobbying effort against him was both
misguided and unfair.''
   There was no immediate responses from the White House, which
never wavered in its support of Cason despite repeated requests
from individual senators to withdraw the nomination.
   Cason was opposed by the Sierra Club, National Wildlife
Federation, Wilderness Society, League of Conservation Voters and
National Audubon Society.
   The groups alleged that Cason's record in several top Interior
Department positions during the Reagan administration showed
favoritism toward private development of public lands, despite
environmental concerns.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, worked to defeat Cason after his committee sent the
nomination to the floor on a 12-7 vote.
   The Senate sent the nomination back to the White House on Friday
and asked that it not be resubmitted.
   It was the first rejection of a Bush nominee by the full Senate
since John Tower was voted down as defense secretary in March.

   Catfish farmers have boosted production
sharply from a year ago, and their prices have dropped almost as
much.
   Production in October was estimated at 31.7 million pounds, the
Agriculture Department said Monday. That was up 21 percent from
26.2 million pounds a year earlier.
   Prices received by growers averaged 64 cents per pound. That was
down 19 percent from 79 cents in October 1988.

   Donald Regan is getting the last word _ or at
least the latest _ in his little tiff with Nancy Reagan over which
one of them did more damage to Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   In a review of Mrs. Reagan's book, ``My Turn,'' the former White
House chief of staff says his former boss' wife ``seems incapable
of understanding how her words and deeds might seem selfish,
hypocritical and, indeed, even frightening to those on the
outside.''
   ``Very sadly ... this book gives aid and comfort to those who
still believe that Ronald Reagan never should have been elected
president in the first place,'' Regan said.
   His review, in the December issue of Washingtonian magazine,
also replied to Mrs. Reagan's criticism of his disclosure in his
memoirs that she had come to rely on the advice of an astrologer
for scheduling Reagan's activities.
   Wrote she: ``It never, ever, occurred to me that Don Regan would
do what he did _ that he would take this information about my
interest in astrology and twist it to seek his revenge on Ronnie on
me.''
   Wrote he, in his review: ``Frankly, I hesitated before putting
this astounding fact into the historical record. I certainly did
not `take this information ... and twist it to seek ... revenge.'
   ``The fact is, I wrote about astrology because it was an
essential truth about the way the Reagans operated. My description
of White House life in my period as chief of staff would have made
little sense if I had omitted it.''
   Mrs. Regan minimized her dependence on astrology _ saying she
called the astrologer only once or twice a month _ but Regan said
astrology played a significant role in shaping the Reagan
presidency.
   ``It was a daily, sometimes hourly, factor in every decision
affecting the president's schedule,'' he wrote. ``He _ or in this
case she _ who controls the president's schedule controls the
workings of the presidency.''
   Mrs. Reagan wrote that she urged her husband to fire Regan after
``a stream of high government officials and congressional leaders''
came to her with the same message: Regan had poor relations with
Congress and the press, was restricting access to Reagan, was
intimidating subordinates.
   Anyway, she said, Regan deserved to be fired because the
Iran-Contra affair occurred ``on his watch.''
   Regan, for his part, said, ``It apparently never registers with
the former first lady that ... she damages her husband and his
presidency'' in the way her book acidly criticizes many of
President Reagan's closest advisers, including Edwin Meese III,
James A. Baker III, David Stockman, Alexander M. Haig, William
Clark and William Casey.
   ``After all,'' he wrote, ``these were Ronald Reagan's choices,
made after close consultation with his financial and political
supporters and friends in California; he must have thought that
they met his own standards.''
   His conclusion: ``Nancy Reagan and Donald Regan both have
written for the historical record. Others will no doubt do the
same; and to that end, history, that greatest of all polygraphs,
will makes its judgment. I am comfortable with that.''

   Congressional negotiators reached agreement on
a $14.8 billion deficit-reduction package for this year early
Tuesday and leaders of both parties predicted the measure would be
quickly approved by Congress and signed by President Bush.
   The deal would bring to a close a partisan budget standoff that
has lasted most of the year.
   ``It will pass overwhelmingly, I think, in both bodies, because
it's a pretty good'' package, said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.,
ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee.
   ``It is a very strong, effective deficit reduction package,''
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told his
colleagues.
   Leaders scheduled votes on the agreement in both chambers on
Tuesday.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he had been
told by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and budget director
Richard Darman ``the White House will support this package.''
   The package includes about $5.7 billion in new tax revenues, as
well as a collection of spending reductions and accounting changes
that result in lowered spending this year.
   It also claims $4.6 billion in savings by leaving cuts in
federal programs imposed by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
in effect through the first week of February. Those cuts were
triggered on Oct. 1 when Bush and lawmakers failed to reach a
budget-cutting deal.
   House and Senate leaders from both parties held meeting after
meeting through the day on the two biggest unfinished pieces of the
puzzle _ deficit reduction bill and a repeal or scale-back of
Medicare catastrophic health insurance.
   The health plan, designed to prevent retirees from being
financially ruined by major illness, was passed last year with
strong bipartisan support and was considered one of the last major
achievements of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   But Congress was forced to rethink the legislation this year
because of a storm of protest from the wealthy elderly, who would
be taxed up to $800 a year to cover their new benefits.
   The House on Sunday, on a 349-57 vote, reaffirmed its position
that the entire law should be scrapped, surtax and benefits
together. The Senate, however, favors a plan to scale back the
benefits enough to drop the surtax in exchange for a small annual
premium.
   The two chambers resumed negotiations Monday in hopes of a
compromise.
   Another ``must-pass'' piece of legislation was a collection of
about $5.3 billion in new taxes, a bunch of accounting changes, and
some across-the-board spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit.
President Bush has said he wants at least $14 billion in deficit
reduction for the current fiscal year.
   Three-way talks involving the House, Senate and the White House
were negotiating that deal, which covers a broad range of issues
including a new system for paying doctors for services to Medicare
patients.
   In the long run, said Sens. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and David
Durenberger, R-Minn., two of the sponsors, the change will hold
down medical costs and help assure that high-qualify medical
services are available to rural areas and inner cities.
   The plan establishes a national fee schedule based on costs of
providing services. Physicians now are reimbursed on the basis of
historical fees that often have little relationship to costs of
providing care.
   The government's costs for physician fees have been increasing
at about 15 percent per year, and in the last fiscal year totalled
$24.5 billion.
   The new fees would be based on the skill, training and time
required to perform the service. The fee structure would be aimed
at bringing down high fees for certain services such as surgery
relative to fees for treatment provided by family practitioners and
internists, who may perform fewer ``procedures'' but whose
treatment, even if only counseling, may require equally high skill
and knowledge.
   Adding to the incentive for approving the deficit bill was,
indirectly, the pay raise that Congress decided last week to give
itself.
   The pay raise package includes initial ``cost-of-living
adjustments'' of 7.9 percent in the House and nearly 10 percent for
the Senate. But those raises won't happen until the budget bill is
enacted. Enactment would cancel spending cuts ordered Oct. 1 under
the Gramm-Rudman law because Congress and the president failed to
meet their deficit-reduction goals.
   On the spending front, President Bush on Monday vetoed his
second appropriations bill in two days because he objected to
abortion provisions.
   Bush on Sunday vetoed a $14.6 billion foreign aid bill because
it contained $15 million for a United Nations population control
agency that operates worldwide, including China.
   China has a one-child-per-family policy that Bush said results
in coerced abortions, and he said U.S. aid to the U.N. agency would
make the United States a party to that practice.
   The House, which does not have a two-thirds majority to override
Bush on abortion questions, approved and sent to the Senate Monday
a bill without the money for the population control agency, and the
Senate followed suit later in the day.
   Bush on Monday vetoed the annual District of Columbia
appropriations bill. While Congress barred the city from using
federal money for abortions, it had taken out out a similar
restriction on the city's use of its own local tax dollars.
   The House immediately took up and passed by voice vote a new
version designed to meet the president's objections, sending the
bill to the Senate, which also passed the clean version of the bill
just before midnight.
   The House by voice vote on Monday sent Bush a third spending
bill, vetoed earlier in an abortion dispute, in a form more to his
liking.
   The $156.7 billion appropriation for the Departments of Labor,
Health and Human Services, and other agencies, was vetoed earlier
because Congress voted to allow federal money to pay for abortions
for poor women who were victims of rape and incest. At Bush's
insistence, the new bill would cover abortions cases only when the
life of the mother was in danger.
   Although its adjournment target dates are typically in early
October, Congress typically works until nearly Christmas in
non-election years. The last time it adjourned before December in
an odd-numbered year was in 1983, when lawmakers went home on Nov.
18.

   Senators writing new lobbying restrictions for
former government officials are taking President Bush's advice to
exempt no one, except for one last-minute request from the White
House to leave out a single executive position _ the president.
   Bush got his way last week, as Senate authors Carl Levin,
D-Mich. and Warren Rudman, R-N.H. made last-minute changes to make
sure the lobbying restrictions leave out presidents.
   The restrictions, including the first application to former
members of Congress, were approved early Saturday as part of the
legislation to raise pay of lawmakers, judges and top executive
branch officials.
   A House source, speaking Monday on condition of anonymity, said,
``It's the White House that's been yelling `parity, parity,
parity''' to make sure that top officials in all three government
branches were covered when they left government. ``That meant
`cover everybody else but me,''' the source said, referring to Bush.
   But White House spokesman Stephen Hart said the administration
had good reason to seek the exclusion for presidents. The bill may
have prevented ``a current president from consulting with a past
president,'' he said.
   ``We felt the president should be removed because of his unique
status,'' said Hart. ``The president wouldn't be able to talk to
anybody in the government ... His work involves the entire
government. It's in the national interest for a sitting president
to be able to consult past presidents.''
   Hart said there's never been an example of a president lobbying
the government after leaving office, adding ``the notion that it
would occur is somewhat demeaning to the presidency.''
   He noted ex-vice presidents are covered by the restrictions, and
should be because many have entered private business.
   Current anti-lobbying language is silent on presidential
coverage, but presidents are considered excluded under a Justice
Department ruling.
   ``In every version until the last one, the intention was to
cover the president. We exempted the president at the White House's
request,'' said Robert Stevenson, Rudman's spokesman.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the prime author of lobbying
restrictions in the House, called the Bush administration's
position ``inconsistent.''
   Bush, he said, ``lobbied so hard to make (the restrictions)
tougher. The president wanted a provision that people couldn't even
lobby for free.''
   Frank said he reluctantly accepted the president's request when
the pay and ethics package reached the House because, ``We couldn't
negotiate everything.''
   Provisions of the new legislation, some similar to current law
and some going beyond it, would:
   _Impose a lifetime ban on lobbying on matters where former
officials were ``personally and substantially involved.''
   _Require a two-year ban on former officials lobbying on matters
that were under their supervision, even if they had not directly
participated.
   _Prohibit lobbying for a year by those personally and
substantially involved in any trade or treaty negotiation.
   _Impose a one-year ban on top senior executives from lobbying
their former agency on any matter in which the ex-officials would
seek official action.
   _Bar any former top official, for one year, from representing,
aiding or advising a foreign government or foreign political party
in a matter before any department or agency.

   Here is a chronology of some key events in the
collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.,
expected to become the nation's largest S&amp;L failure at a cost to
taxpayers of $2 billion.
   
   _Feb. 22, 1984: American Continental Corp., a home-building
company formed six years earlier by Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire
Charles H. Keating Jr., buys Lincoln Savings and Loan for $51
million. The thrift embarks on a program of rapid growth by moving
out of residential lending and into junk bonds and risky direct
investments in real estate and commercial ventures.
   _Jan. 31, 1985: The Federal Home Loan Bank Board passes a
regulation restricting S&amp;Ls' direct investments to 10 percent of
assets. Lincoln fights the rule, hiring economist Alan Greenspan to
help argue its case. Greenspan, President Ford's chief economic
adviser, now is chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
   _Feb. 13, 1985: Greenspan writes to the Federal Home Loan Bank
in San Francisco, arguing that Lincoln should be exempted from the
direct investment limit. Greenspan testifies before a House
subcommittee Feb. 27, recommending direct investments for thrifts.
   _March 12, 1986: The Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco,
suspicious of Lincoln's rapid growth and investment activity,
begins an examination.
   _Aug. 18, 1986: San Francisco examiners inform the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board in Washington that Lincoln exceeded direct
investment limits by $600 million.
   _Dec. 18, 1986: Lee Henkel, appointed to the bank board two
months earlier with Keating's support, proposes a rule that would
exempt Lincoln from the direct investment limits.
   _March 6, 1987: Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., then a member of
the Senate Banking Committee and now the panel's chairman, meets
with bank board Chairman Edwin Gray and suggests Gray meet with
several senators who have concerns about regulators' treatment of
Lincoln.
   _March 23, 1987: Riegle receives $76,100 in campaign donations
from Keating and his associates, most of it from a fundraiser at
Detroit's Ponchartrain Hotel, a Keating property. A year later,
after unfavorable publicity, Riegle returns the contributions.
   _April 2, 1987: Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz., meet with
Gray in DeConcini's office. Gray later testifies before the House
Banking Committee that the senators offered a ``quid pro quo'': The
senators would persuade Lincoln to increase its home-lending
activity if regulators stop pressuring it to pull out of its other
investments. The senators deny this version.
   _April 9, 1987: All five senators, at Gray's suggestion, meet
with San Francisco examiners. Notes taken at the meeting show that
DeConcini suggested that Lincoln could increase its home lending in
exchange for regulatory forbearance. The examiners tell the
senators they are preparing to make criminal referrals to the
Justice Department about Lincoln. The meeting ends.
   Keating had contributed a total of $1.3 million to the senators'
campaigns and political causes.
   _May 1, 1987: San Francisco examiners recommend that Lincoln,
although solvent, be seized for operating in an unsafe and unsound
manner and dissipating its assets.
   _July 1, 1987: M. Danny Wall, a former aide to Sen. Jake Garn of
Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee,
succeeds Gray as bank board chairman. Wall would have three
meetings with Keating: Sept. 24, 1987, Jan. 28, 1988, and Jan. 17,
1989. In August, Wall orders his staff to conduct an independent
review of the Lincoln examination.
   _Sept. 15, 1987: The Securities and Exchange Commission opens an
inquiry concerning Lincoln, American Continental and their staffs.
The investigation is still open.
   _April 14, 1988: American Continental tells the SEC that it
plans to sell subordinated debt through Lincoln's branches. The SEC
allows the sale to proceed and $250 million of the debt, which now
appears virtually worthless, is eventually sold to 22,000 buyers.
More than half those buyers are older than 60 and many say they
believed they were buying federally insured certificates of deposit.
   _May 20, 1988: The bank board in Washington signs a memorandum
of understanding with Lincoln. It provides for a new examination to
be conducted by officials in Washington, not San Francisco.
   _June 10, 1988: California regulators forbid American
Continental from selling its debt through Lincoln lobbies.
   _Nov. 22, 1988: The second bank board examination is concluded.
   _December 1988 through March 1989: Keating makes three attempts
to sell Lincoln. Sens. DeConcini and Cranston and Rep. Carroll
Hubbard, D-Ky., make calls to Wall on Lincoln's behalf. The bank
board eventually rejects the applications, saying because the
buyers all had ties in some way to Keating the sales would not be
arms-length transactions.
   _Feb. 14, 1989: The bank board begins a third examination of
Lincoln.
   _April 13, 1989: American Continental Corp. files for protection
under bankruptcy laws. A day later, the bank board seizes control
of Lincoln. But, regulators' access to some of its assets are
complicated by the earlier bankruptcy filing.
   _April 17, 1989: The bank board sends criminal referrals on
alleged fraud at Lincoln to U.S. attorneys and the FBI in Phoenix,
Ariz., New York and Los Angeles.
   _May 12, 1989: Lincoln, in a lawsuit, alleges that the seizure
by regulators was illegal.
   _Sept. 15, 1989: The Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency with
jurisdiction over Lincoln, seeks $1.1 billion from Keating, his
relatives and associates in a fraud and racketeering suit alleging
Keating diverted depositors' money for his own use.
   _Sept. 18, 1989: DeConcini announces he will repay Keating's
donations to his 1988 campaign.
   _Sept. 21, 1989: Subordinated debt holders sue the state of
California in a class-action suit alleging state officials should
have blocked the debt sales.
   _Oct. 13, 1989: Common Cause, a government watchdog group, asks
the Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to
investigate the legality of Keating's contributions to the five
senators.
   _Oct. 17, 1989: Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, launches the first of at least six
hearings investigating Lincoln's collapse. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman estimates that
taxpayers will have to spend between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to
protect Lincoln's depositors.
   _Oct. 27, 1989: Gonzalez writes to President Bush suggesting
that Wall should ``step aside.''
   _Nov. 17, 1989: The Senate Ethics Committee decides to appoint
an outside counsel to investigate the actions of the five senators,
the first step in what could become a more extensive probe.
   _Nov. 21, 1989: Wall and Keating are scheduled to respond before
Gonzalez's committee to allegations about their conduct.

   Here are the key figures in the House Banking
Committee's investigation of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association
of Irvine, Calif., and a related inquiry into five senators who
intervened on its behalf with federal regulators:
   
   CHARLES B. KEATING Jr. _ A Phoenix millionaire who, as chairman
of a home construction company, American Continental Corp.,
purchased Lincoln in February 1984 for $51 million and increased
its assets from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion by 1988. Keating waged
a fervent five-year campaign against federal thrift regulators who
opposed his direct investment of federally insured S&amp;L deposits in
real estate ventures. In 1986 and 1987 he contributed a total of
$1.3 million to the political causes of five senators who
intervened on Lincoln's behalf with officials of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board. Lincoln was seized by the board last April and
regulators have filed a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit
against Keating.
   EDWIN J. GRAY _ A former White House official who, as chairman
of the bank board from 1983 until July 1987, sought to limit direct
investments by thrifts and was sued several times by Keating. In
May 1987, Gray deferred action on a recommendation by regulators at
the Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco that Lincoln be taken
over by the government because of what they said were unsafe and
unsound lending practices. Gray told the House committee he was
summoned to an April 2, 1987, meeting in the office of Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., that was arranged by Sen. Donald W. Reigle,
D-Mich. At that meeting and in the presence of three other
senators, Gray said DeConcini asked him ``on behalf of their friend
and contributor'' at Lincoln to rescind a regulation curbing direct
investments by thrifts. Gray subsequently arranged a two-hour
meeting April 9, 1987, in DeConcini's office between five senators
and San Francisco Home Loan Bank officials then trying to close
Lincoln.
   M. DANNY WALL _ A former banking aide to Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah,
succeeded Gray as chairman of the bank board. Wall has been the
chief target of the House Banking Committee's chairman, who last
month asked President Bush in a letter to fire him. Wall has said
the board did not follow the San Francisco officials'
recommendation to seize Lincoln because proof was insufficient to
justify the action.
   SEN. DENNIS DeCONCINI, D-Ariz. _ Hosted in his office in April
1987 two meetings between thrift regulators and other senators.
DeConcini received $48,100 from Keating and his associates for 1988
re-election campaign but announced two months ago he would return
the money. Early this year he called Wall twice and also California
state regulators urging approval for Keating to sell Lincoln as an
alternative to the government seizing it. DeConcini has denied
Gray's account of the April 2 meeting.
   SEN. ALAN CRANSTON, D-Calif. _ Met with Gray on April 2, 1987,
and the following week with San Francisco examiners, both in
DeConcini's office. Cranston, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate as
the party's whip, also called Wall and California state regulators
earlier this year urging approval for Keating to sell Lincoln. For
his 1986 re-election campaign, Cranston received $39,000 from
Keating and his associates. He also solicited from Keating $850,000
for three voter education projects in California and $85,000 for
the California Democratic Party.
   SEN. JOHN McCAIN, R-Ariz. _ Attended April 2 and April 9
meetings in DeConcini's office; received $112,000 in campaign
contributions from Keating and his associates. McCain said earlier
this year he was reimbursing American Continental $13,433 for
flights he and his family took aboard Keating's corporate planes to
and from the Bahamas in 1984-86.
   SEN. JOHN GLENN, D-Ohio _ Attended April 2 and April 9 meetings
in DeConcini's office, where regulators quoted him as telling them
to either make a case against Lincoln or ``get off its back.'' A
candidate for his party's presidential nomination in 1984, the
former astronaut received $34,000 in direct political contributions
from Keating and his associates and a political action committee
associated with Glenn received another $200,000.
   SEN. DONALD W. RIEGLE Jr. _ Met several times in 1987 with
Keating or his associates and, according to Gray, first told him
that he would be summoned to the April 2 meeting in DeConcini's
office. Riegle did not attend that meeting but was present at the
meeting April 9 with San Francisco regulators. Riegle received a
$76,100 from Keating and his associates for his 1988 re-election
campaign but announced later he was returning the money.
   REP. HENRY B. GONZALEZ, D-Texas _ As chairman of the House
Banking Committee, has directed a six-hearing investigation into
why Lincoln was allowed to stay open for two years after examiners
recommended seizing it. For a year, Gonzalez has blamed the size of
the S&amp;L crisis on Wall and has attempted to focus the Lincoln
hearings on him. Last month he asked President Bush to fire Wall.
   MICHAEL PATRIARCA and WILLIAM K. BLACK _ Respectively, the
principal agent in charge of the San Francisco Bank Board office
and its top lawyer. On May 1, 1987, they recommended that Lincoln
be seized following a year-long examination of the thrift.
Patriarca and Black were the chief regulators summoned to the April
9, 1987, meeting in DeConcini's office and are now portrayed by
House Banking Committee members as the unsung heroes in the Lincoln
case.
   ROBERT S. BENNETT _ A Washington attorney specializing in white
collar crime, was hired by the Senate Ethics Committee last week to
head an investigation into the role played by the five senators in
the Lincoln case. Bennett is a brother of former Education
Secretary William J. Bennett, now director of the White House
Office of Drug Control Policy.

   So many funeral processions in one day.
Five, and this stricken town's sorrow seemed even greater because
the coffins were so small. One was covered with a teddy bear-shaped
wreath of flowers.
   A stuffed Garfield doll, a small dinosaur and baseball cards lay
nearby.
   It was apparent that the bells tolled for the children, not for
the spirit of the town.
   ``It will take time, maybe a long time, but we will get through
this,'' Bud Sharp was saying, standing on the lawn of the First
Presbyterian Church where people gathered Monday for the last of
the five funerals that gray and chilly afternoon.
   ``The tragedy was the worst we have ever had,'' Sharp said. ``At
least it shook us more than any I know of. But I believe it brought
us closer together as a community, as neighbors, and I have a
feeling that will last.''
   Sharp was in charge of the first unit of volunteer firefighters
who responded Thursday to a call from the East Coldenham Elementary
School. A tornado had smashed down a wall of brick and glass onto
the children at lunch, killing seven youngsters and injuring 18
others.
   The town's collective grief was manifest at the two funerals on
Saturday and the five others Monday.
   Three of the five families chose to keep the services private,
to bear their sorrow alone. Others did not.
   About 600 mourners crowded St. Francis of Assisi Church, a grand
old brick edifice with twin bell towers and stained glass windows.
Over the generations, it has been the site of hundreds of funerals
but surely few as unsettling as the requiem for Adam Joseph Soltis,
age 7.
   ``We remember today our little brother Adam and his
schoolmates,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Howard Dalton.
   The organ sounded joyful, and 600 voices found solace in ancient
rites:
   ``He will raise you up on eagles' wings, bear you on the breath
of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm
of his hand. ... ''
   The music swelled within the church where 13 priests wore white
and gold vestments. The priests surrounded the candles aglow with
life, the white flowers, the little coffin draped in white, so tiny
before the altar beneath the vault of the ceiling.
   ``We have our faith,'' said an elderly woman, turning, cheeks
wet, to embrace the younger man next to her.
   ``And each other,'' he replied.
   About 100 people went to a funeral home to mourn Charles
``C.J.'' Scotto, 7, who lay in an eggshell-colored casket decorated
with the teddy bear-shaped wreath of carnations and daisies. Nearby
were his Garfield doll, a New York Jets pin and C.J.'s other
treasures.
   The service at First Presbyterian was for Maria Jean Stuhmer, 8.
Also buried Monday were Joanna Teresa Lichtler, 7, and Amy Marie
Innis, 8.
   Peter Orsino and Larae Marie Litchhult, both 8, were buried
Saturday.
   Teri Potter, mother of four, is a nurse at one of the hospitals
where injured children were taken.
   She stood at the door of a room where Michael Holmes and George
Marshall Jr., both age 7, lay in beds with their broken limbs
encased in plaster suspended from traction slings. She watched the
firefighters who rescued them drop by to touch them and bring them
gifts.
   ``They were stressed out,'' she said. ``They wanted to come and
see the children they saved rather than dwell on the children they
could not. They certainly brought smiles to the faces of those
two.''
   Mrs. Potter had another thought that seemed to reflect a feeling
prevalent in this normally placid Hudson Valley town.
   ``The deaths, the injuries, made me step back and think of my
own life and my values, think of the few things that I've been
upset about recently.
   ``All of them mean absolutely nothing in the perspective of one
tragic afternoon.''

<HEAD>Committee Urges Investigation of Former HUD Official</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former federal housing official appears to
have repeatedly violated ethics laws by using her government
contacts to help her private business, a congressional report says.
   The report endorsed by the House Government Operations Committee
and released Monday urges the Justice Department to investigate
June Koch, a former official at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   The report, based on a General Accounting Office investigation
and subsequent review by a House subcommittee that investigated
Reagan-era scandals at HUD, alleges Koch used her influence on HUD
officials to benefit the consulting firm she has headed since
leaving HUD two years ago.
   The firm helps U.S. companies seeking trade with the Soviet
Union. While at HUD Koch was involved in a number of efforts to
encourage U.S. companies' participation in the Soviet Union's
construction industry.
   ``It is clear that Ms. Koch traded on her position at HUD to
gain benefits and access for herself and her clients,'' said the
report.
   The Justice Department is not bound by the recommendation but
generally conducts preliminary reviews of matters referred to it by
Congress or government agencies.
   Koch was not in her office Monday, according to a receptionist
at the Virginia-based consulting firm, Construction, Marketing and
Trading. In April testimony to the subcommittee and in a subsequent
interview, she denied any wrongdoing.
   Koch was HUD's assistant secretary for policy development from
1984 to 1987. Her duties included arranging HUD participation in a
number of trade issues involving the Soviet Union, including agency
participation in a Moscow trade fair the GAO found was a waste of
HUD money.
   She left the agency in 1987 and founded the consulting firm,
whose clients included 10 companies that participated in the
HUD-sponsored Soviet trip. She also was retained as a consultant to
then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce on Soviet-related matters.
   The report said Koch took a number of steps that appeared
designed to benefit her business and clients in alleged violation
of laws that prevent former government officials from improperly
using their government contacts for private gain.
   Among the steps cited in the report were contacting HUD
officials and allegedly pressuring them to change the itineraries
for visiting Soviet delegations so that they could meet with her
clients.
   ``Ms. Koch enjoyed access to HUD and to visiting Soviet
delegations that was not generally offered to others,'' the report
said. ``Such access gave Ms. Koch and her clients an advantage over
competitors who might be interested in developing Soviet trade
relations.''
   Koch had received permission from HUD's general counsel to serve
as a consultant at the same time her company was involved in Soviet
trade issues, but the HUD attorneys had advised agency officials to
closely monitor her activities to prevent any conflicts.
   However, the report said HUD failed to monitor her activities.
It recommended that HUD and other government agencies avoid even
the appearance of conflicts by refusing to hire former officials as
consultants in areas in which the former officials now are involved
in the private sector.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended at a
record high.
   The dollar closed at 144.43 yen, down 0.24 yen from Monday's
close of 144.67 yen. It opened at 144.30 yen and moved between
144.30 yen and 144.48 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 166.29 points, or 0.46
percent, closing at 36,059.87, a record high. It had lost 70.16
points Monday. Tuesday's close was the first beyond 36,000 line.
   Stock dealers attributed the index's recovery to the yen's
stability in foreign exchange.
   Kazuhiko Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co. said
buying by investment trust companies also contributed largely to
the Nikkei's moderate gain.
   ``Following yesterday's temporary loss, market players were once
again gaining buying incentives,'' he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving tightly
amid concern over the dollar-selling intervention of the Bank of
Japan, traders said.
   The central bank sold about $200 million Monday to halt the
dollar's rise against the yen.
   While many market players were reluctant to buy the dollar,
institutional investors picked up the currency as it fell near the
144.30-yen line, said a trader with a major commercial bank.
   Another trader with the Bank of Tokyo said the Tokyo market was
taking a wait-and-see attitude before the release of the U.S.
consumer price index figure for October later Tuesday.
   The trader said there will be no major impact on the market if
the CPI growth is about 0.4 percent.

   A Navy jet collided with a civilian
aircraft on a runway at Pensacola Naval Air Station, officials
said. No injuries were reported.
   A TA-4 training jet had landed Monday night and was slowing to
taxi speed when a Cessna T-47 aircraft crossed the path, said
retired Capt. J.B. McKamey, spokesman for the base.
   The collision occurred three days after the Navy ended its
service-wide safety review that temporarily halted normal
operations due to a rash of accidents.
   The Navy did not immediately determine who was responsible for
Monday's accident. The Navy and National Transportation Safety
Board will investigate, McKamey said.
   Two military men were in the jet, and four people were in the
civilian plane. The accident, which occurred about 6:30 p.m.,
caused a minor fuel leak, McKamey said. The Navy closed the air
field after the accident.
   Last week's Navy stand-down included a safety review for
personnel following an unprecedented string of accidents.
   Since Oct. 29, 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at
least 71 injured in accidents such as sailors being washed
overboard, plane crashes, ship fires and the accidental bombing of
a cruiser.

<HEAD>Safety Groups Rank Car Manufacturers on Air Bag Installation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Asian carmakers rank at the bottom in
providing and promoting air bags in their 1990 cars, a coalition of
auto safety and consumer groups said today.
   The groups ranked Chrysler Corp. at the top among 12 major
manufacturers selling cars in the United States, followed by
Mercedes Benz. Chrysler is putting air bags in the driver's side of
92 percent of its 1990 models.
   Three million of the 10 million 1990 cars expected to be sold in
the United States will have air bags under federal rules, according
to a report compiled by Public Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety
and Motor Voters.
   But some drivers may not know what they've got, said Joan
Claybrook, president of the Ralph Nader-founded Public Citizen and
former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   ``NHTSA's engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags,''
said Ms. Claybrook. She said the agency needs to promote air bags
and closely monitor their use to perfect the various systems being
installed in new cars.
   ``People should know when they buy the car that this system is
going to inflate,'' Ms. Claybrook said in an interview, adding some
drivers have been surprised by air bags they didn't know were in
their cars until they crashed.
   The three safety groups were releasing data on air bag
installation and promotion at a news conference today.
   Hyundai and Subaru, which do not have air bags in any models,
ranked at the bottom of the auto safety groups' ``report card,''
followed by Honda.
   Other low-ranking manufacturers included Mazda and Nissan, which
placed 8th and 9th.
   Volkswagen was 7th, preceded by Toyota in 6th place and General
Motors in 5th. Ford and Volvo tied for 3rd place, behind Chrysler
and Mercedes.
   Air bags were first installed in 10,000 General Motors cars in
the mid-1970s but were not used again until they were introduced in
some Fords in 1985.
   Auto safety proponents have been pushing for both air bags and a
lap and shoulder belts for all front-seat occupants.
   Federal rules applying to the 1990 models require either
driver's side air bags or another passive restraint system for both
front seats in all new cars sold in the United States. Some
manufacturers have opted for seat belts that automatically encircle
front seat occupants as they step into the car.
   The safety groups ranked car builders according to the number of
1990 models equipped with the safety devices as standard equipment,
plans for future installation of air bags, protection devices used
in all car seating positions and information provided to dealers
and the contents of company ads.
   Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto
Safety, said auto dealers are not giving customers proper
information about air bags.
   He said Honda dealers told consumer surveyors air bags might
blow up in the driver's face, which he called ``a stunning piece of
misinformation.''
   A spokeswoman for Honda, Toni Harrington, said she had never
heard of such a claim being made by Honda dealers.
   ``We would not be putting air bags in our cars if they were not
considered safe,'' she said. Honda offers air bags only in its
top-line Legends but plans to add them to other models, Ms.
Harrington said.
   Rosemary Dunlop, of Motor Voters, said the groups are most
concerned about the lack of availability of air bags in
lower-priced models.
   ``These cars are most likely to be purchased by young drivers
most likely to be involved in a crash,'' she said.
   The groups said all manufacturers have done poorly in providing
air bags for vehicles other than passenger cars.
   No company plans installation of air bags in vans until the 1993
models, when both Ford and Chrysler will introduce them in minivans.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Proposes Program to Tighten Gun Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh wants to
prevent felons from purchasing weapons by requiring that gun
dealers check computerized criminal records before sales are
completed.
   Thornburgh said Monday that the plan will take time and
significant amounts of money to put in place, with states and the
federal government needing to upgrade and computerize criminal
records so they could be checked by gun dealers.
   ``While a comprehensive, accurate system for identifying felons
at the point-of-sale simply cannot be accomplished in the near
term, we must recognize it as a worthwhile goal to be accomplished
over time,'' Thornburgh said.
   Under the attorney general's proposal, licensed firearms dealers
would use a touch-tone telephone to check computer records to find
if each prospective gun purchaser had a felony conviction.
   Thornburgh said he was ordering the FBI to expand its
computerized data base of felons prohibited from buying guns. At
present, only 40 percent to 60 percent of FBI conviction records
are computerized.
   The bureau was also ordered to draft standards for reporting
criminal records for state and local police agencies.
   Thornburgh said the department's Bureau of Justice Assistance
will set aside $9 million for each of the next three years to help
states comply with new reporting standards.
   Under legislation enacted last year, the attorney general was
required to report to Congress on what steps could be taken to
prevent felons from purchasing guns.
   Thornburgh rejected a more expensive option submitted to him by
a task force that would have set up a system to instantly check the
fingerprints of purchasers in gun stores to determine if they had
criminal records.
   The task force estimated it would cost up to $27 billion to
automate fingerprint records and install scanning equipment in gun
stores.
   The attorney general said records will have to be improved
before a new system can work.
   ``No one list of felons exists. In addition, many of the
criminal history records maintained by law enforcement are either
out of date or incomplete, or both,'' Thornburgh said. ``Finally,
current records often contain arrest information without a notation
of the final disposition.''
   The task force estimated it would cost between $36 million and
$46 million to set up a telephone system for checking computerized
records. The system would cost $53 million to $70 million to
operate each year.
   The task force said a $7 to $9 fee charged to each prospective
gun buyer would cover much of the costs.

   Nicaraguan government negotiators are
promising new proposals they say would overcome differences
blocking an agreement with the Contra rebels on restoring a
cease-fire.
   Contra negotiators are pledging new ideas of their own but,
after eight negotiating sessions, they sound far less optimistic
than their Sandinista counterparts on the possibility for success.
   The talks were scheduled to resume today.
   ``We will try to present something ... that will pull us out of
this stalemate,'' said the chief Contra negotiator, Col. Enrique
Bermudez, after a two-hour negotiating session Monday at the
Organization of American States.
   Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said,
``We're going to stretch flexibility as far as it can be stretched
... We are approaching the end of the effort.''
   Tinoco said his government is reassessing its insistence that
the Contras agree to a total withdrawal from Nicaraguan territory
to base camps in Honduras as its price for agreeing to a cease
fire. He left the impression the government may settle for a
partial withdrawal.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega suspended the cease-fire on
Nov. 1 after alleging the Contra forces had engaged in terrorist
activities.
   Bermudez accused the Sandinistas of hardening their position by
insisting on both the withdrawal of the Contras and their
demobilization but Tinoco said Bermudez misunderstood the
Sandinista position.
   A commission made of United Nations and Organization of American
States mediators spent the weekend drawing up revisions of a plan
they had set forth during the early going of the negotiations,
which began Nov. 9.
   Part of Monday's negotiating session was spent going over the
revisions.
   Before the talks resumed Monday, rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros
accused the Sandinistas of not negotiating in good faith.
   ``They want a total surrender,'' he said. ``They want an
unconditional surrender.''
   Matamoros called for an immediate cease-fire with appropriate
verification procedures.
   Tinoco reaffirmed his government's view that the cease-fire must
be linked to a ``separation of forces'' _ meaning the withdrawal of
Contra forces to base camps in Honduras.
   ``That's fundamental,'' Tinoco said.
   Tinoco also disclosed he had a brief meeting with a State
Department official Saturday to discuss issues relating to the
staffing of the respective embassies of the two countries.
   He didn't identify the official with whom he spoke.
   The administration generally has avoided high-level contact with
the Sandinistas, urging them instead to focus attention on
resolving their differences with both the Contras and the internal
opposition.

   When asked to name some qualities that make
this country special, one young man offers, ``cable TV.'' Asked how
to encourage more young people to vote, one young woman replies,
``Pay them.''
   People for the American Way used these examples from a survey of
youth values Monday to sound a warning that ``America's youth are
alarmingly ill-prepared to keep democracy alive in the 1990s and
beyond.''
   ``Our survey confirmed our worst fear: American youth are turned
off and tuning out the community and country around them,'' said
the group's president, Arthur Kropp.
   ``While the youth of China, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and elsewhere are struggling for democracy, American youth are
leaving democracy to wither,'' said Kropp. ``While youth behind the
Iron Curtain are reveling in that little freedom they have been
allowed, American youth are taking their very real freedoms for
granted.''
   The survey of 1,100 young people ages 15-24 and 405 social
studies teachers was conducted in four parts between April and June
by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. Key findings were:
   _72 percent of the youth, asked to grade various life goals on a
scale of 1 to 10, gave a 9 or 10 to ``career success''; 68 percent
gave high ratings to ``having a close-knit family life,'' and 56
percent to ``enjoying life and having a good time.'' Twenty-four
percent listed helping the community.
   _Most young people do not see their own destiny as linked with
the nation's. While a strong majority are confident about their own
personal prospects, only 42 percent of young people surveyed say
they feel optimistic about America's future. About 47 percent say
they are worried that America's best years might be behind us.
   _Only 12 percent of the youth surveyed volunteered ``voting'' as
a basic tenet of good citizenship. Comparing the citizenship
potential of today's young people with those of a decade ago, 37
percent of the teachers surveyed think today's youth are less
likely to become good citizens, while 16 percent say today's
students are more likely to become good citizens than those of 10
years ago.
   _By a more than 2-1 ratio _ 45 percent to 21 percent _ teachers
say today's high school students are less interested in politics
and public affairs than their counterparts of a decade ago.
   _60 percent of the young people say they know ``just some'' or
``very little'' about the way our government works. When it comes
to reading the newspaper or watching the news on television, 57
percent say they have ``just some'' or ``very little'' interest in
following news about politics and government.
   _54 percent of teachers cite the ``poor example'' set by
politicians as a ``strong reason'' for youths' non-involvement.
   Kropp said the ``hopeful signs'' in the survey are that 58
percent reject the notion that ``people should take care of
themselves and shouldn't expect others to do things for them,''
while 35 percent agree with that idea. Also, 89 percent of the
youth support a community service program in their high school that
offers extra credit to students who volunteer.
   People For the American Way Chairman John Buchanan called for an
``all-out effort to teach every young person in America the full
meaning of citizenship.'' He said parents must vote and become
involved in the community, schools must provide more community
service opportunities and political leaders must set a positive
example that inspires citizen activism.
   People for the American Way is a public interest group.

<HEAD>France's `Great Fear' of 1789 Was Caused by Hallucinogen, Historian
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Maryland historian is adding a
hallucinogenic note to the longstanding mystery of what triggered
three weeks of terror in the French countryside that became a key
event in the revolution of 1789.
   Mary Kilburne Mattossian, in a new book called ``Poisons of the
Past: Molds, Epidemics and History,'' says the phenomenon
historians call the Great Fear was probably caused by hallucinogens
contained in a fungus on rye wheat.
   R. Emmet Kennedy Jr., a professor of European History at George
Washington University and an authority on the French Revolution,
said he has not read Ms. Matossian's book but is familiar with her
thesis and does not put much stock in it.
   ``I am not a biologist and haven't investigated, but I simply
haven't taken it very seriously,'' Kennedy said in an interview.
   ``We believe that the Great Fear was caused by the revolution in
Paris, the storming of the Bastille and specifically by the fear
that the aristocrats were going to wage a counter-revolution
against that revolution in Paris and Versailles and that they were
setting loose brigands into the countryside to destroy their
crops,'' he said.
   Ms. Matossian, an associate professor of history at the
University of Maryland, blames the fear on ergot, a fungus that
grows on rye in certain conditions and contains the alkaloid
lysergic acid, from which the hallucinogenic drug LSD is extracted.
   Her view clashes with those of many historians that the
phenomenon was an insurrection of peasants who resented paying
taxes and tithes.
   ``In the spring of 1789 there were peasant protests against the
food shortage and `feudal' practices, but the Great Fear of July
and August was mainly a panic, not a protest,'' she writes in her
book, published by Yale University Press.
   Previous studies have indicated there was no foundation for
these fears because, although there were vagrants roaming the
countryside in search of food, they were apparently neither
organized nor dangerous.
   ``There has been documentation that shows that it was based on
rumor,'' Kennedy said. ``Somebody would come to the outskirts of a
village and announce that a troop of brigands were arriving and
then somebody would go to the next village and multiply the number
by 10, and it went on and on like that.''
   Ms. Matossian's book was based on research in libraries in the
United States, France, England and the Soviet Union. She said her
conclusion was based on ``a series of interesting coincidences that
make a causal connection plausible.''
   She cited a previous study of public health in Brittany that
reported toxic ergot had been found on about one-twelfth of all
ears of rye in the region in July 1789.
   ``This was indeed a prodigious amount,'' she wrote. ``Rye flour
containing 1 percent ergot is sufficient to cause a full-blown
epidemic.''
   The Great Fear went on for three weeks. Weeping and shouting
peasants took to the woods with pitchforks and muskets while others
crisscrossed the countryside looting and burning chateaus.
   It led French aristocrats to abandon some of their feudal
privileges, and prompted a reaction among landowners who maintained
order should be restored in the countryside before further
concessions were made.

<HEAD>Defense Cuts Could Produce Proposal for Further Troop Reductions
in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration may propose a new
round of American troop reductions in Western Europe _ provided
they are matched by Soviet cutbacks _ as a result of an easing of
East-West tensions, U.S. officials say.
   Government studies, started before the current wave of political
reform struck the communist world, are being accelerated also to
consider new U.S. budget constraints, the officials said Monday.
   The studies _ and a recommendation to President Bush _ could be
completed in time for his Dec. 2-3 meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Mediterranean.
   In any event, Bush is likely to pursue the subject with leaders
of the 15 NATO countries when he meets with them in Brussels right
after the saltwater summit.
   ``Some of them are a little nervous about additional
reductions,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Those issues, as well as questions about possible German
reunification, were expected to be raised today in a meeting
between visiting West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher and Secretary of State James A. Baker III. West German
officials said Genscher's visit was prompted by the opening of the
Berlin Wall and other changes in East Germany.
   Bush proposed at a NATO summit meeting in May that U.S. troops
be reduced to 275,000 from their current level of about 305,000.
The proposal and across-the-board cutbacks in the allies' tanks,
artillery and other conventional weapons in Europe are under
negotiation with the Warsaw Pact in Vienna.
   The reductions are contingent upon even deeper reductions by the
Soviet-led bloc.
   The Warsaw Pact advanced its own comprehensive proposal in the
talks. Progress has been slowed by disagreement over the kinds of
aircraft to place under ceilings and a dispute between Greece and
Turkey over whether to include the Turkish port of Mersin in an
East-West treaty.
   An argument being made here against a proposal for a second
round of cuts is that it could slow the current negotiations, the
officials said.
   But clearly the administration is thinking beyond a troop
reduction of about 10 percent, the officials said. One of them
cited a recent Pentagon decision to have some American troops along
the East-West border carry revolvers instead of rifles. The
official said this reflected a lessening of tensions ``and is
indicative of some major revamping.''
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney said Sunday the
Bush administration would consider troop reduction proposals that
went far beyond the cuts involved in the negotiations.
   The two U.S. officials said Monday the options under study were
to revise the current NATO proposal to make deeper cuts or to frame
a second proposal that would be negotiated after a treaty is
concluded.
   Bush had predicted completion of the pact by next May, but since
then many experts within the administration have registered doubts
privately that the accord could be concluded by then.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said
``it is premature'' to talk about a second proposal for cutbacks in
U.S. conventional forces. She said ``if we were to do such a thing,
it would obviously have to be carefully explored with our allies in
the context of the Vienna negotiations.''
   Cheney, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley''
program, said the likelihood of a conflict between the United
States and the Soviet Union was ``at its lowest point since World
War II.''
   He also said he would agree to military cuts to meet
deficit-reduction goals.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed above
the 36,000-point level for the first time today, while the dollar
edged down against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.43 yen, down 0.24 yen from Monday's
close of 144.67 yen. The U.S. currency opened at 144.30 yen, its
low for the day, and ranged as high as 144.48 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 166.29 points, or 0.46
percent, closing at 36,059.87, yet another high. The index
previously has jumped momentarily over the 36,000-point mark in the
course of trading, but today's close was the first beyond the
36,000-line.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said the yen's stability
against the dollar reassured Japanese investors and encouraged them
to buy.
   Interest in a wide variety of issues also helped the index rise,
despite intermittent selling by investment trust companies for
profit-taking, he said.
   Among the winners were real estate, construction and electrical
issues, including Sony and Pioneer.
   An estimated 800 million shares changed hands on the market's
first section, up from Monday's 700 million shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate stayed within a narrow
range because of a lack of fresh market-affecting news, said a Bank
of Tokyo trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Only the British pound showed any major fluctuations today, he
said. Market players sold the British currency following rumors
that the Bank of England might intervene in the market, he said.
   But investors were leery of letting the dollar approach the
144.50-yen mark because of fear of prompting dollar-selling by the
Bank of Japan, the trader added.
   Japan's central bank reportedly sold about $200 million on
Monday to stem the dollar's rise.
   Spot trading volume was estimated at $3.77 billion.

   A 400-pound, bright yellow mechanical arm
replaces the human touch at the Robot Music Store, where customers
sample and buy compact discs entirely by machine.
   The robot system plays 30-second samples of song for its
customers, takes their orders and accepts payment by cash or credit
card. It also hands over the merchandise, returns change and
receipts, restocks shelves and places its own inventory orders.
   Developers claim the shop, which opened Monday, is the first
fully automated retail store.
   ``Anyone who can operate a CD machine can operate this,'' said
Dave Carroll, who, along with Bob Cahlander, founded Robot
Manufacturing Center Inc. more than three years ago in Red Wing, 40
miles southeast of Minneapolis. The company's robot frying cooks
are being tested in two McDonald's outlets.
   The ``store'' is something like a giant vending machine in the
open court shopping area of a large office building. CDs are
stacked on shelves on the inside walls of a transparent enclosure
covering 140 square feet and standing about 8 feet high. On the
outside are four earphone sets, a video screen for customers to
punch in transactions and fixtures to take in the money or credit
cards and deliver CDs and change.
   At the center of the operation is the robot arm that can rotate
around the enclosure to grab a customer's selection and deliver it.
   Carroll and Cahlander said they will test the idea in
Minneapolis to see if it is profitable and whether customers like
buying from a machine instead of a human.
   Initial reaction was mixed. Heather Jenkel, waiting to get a
closer look at the robot before buying, said she liked the idea of
being able to listen to the music before making a purchase, but
prefers to deal with a person.
   ``I like someone to be able to talk to me and tell me `Ya, I
heard this and I think it's great,''' Jenkel said.
   Monday's test of the technology was marred by one glitch. The
robot arm was shut down for a five-minute repair after it had
trouble dispensing a classical CD, said Cahlander. The arm will
have to be retooled to pick up CDs with boxes of varying sizes, he
said.
   Using the machine is much like banking at an automatic teller.
   If customers have trouble, there is a toll-free telephone number
to call for help, Carroll said.
   If similar machines are in use, ``nobody else has talked about
it,'' said Eric Mittelstadt, president and chief executive officer
of GMFanuc Robotics Corp., maker of the basic robot unit.

   When the plaintiffs are human and the defendants
are beasts, being a lawyer can get pretty hairy _ except when it's
your specialty.
   For five years, Joleen Marion has been the pet set's Perry
Mason. She runs Legal Action for Animals, a Manhattan-based,
non-profit group that advises on and litigates a range of animal
issues, including pet privileges, lab experimentation and
malpractice lawsuits against veterinarians.
   ``We get about 70 calls a week from across the country on
complaints about everything from experimental torture done on
animals, to elderly people who want to know if they can bring their
cats to a nursing home,'' she said.
   In one instance, a New York man claimed that a beaver's dam had
backed up a septic tank, resulting in a foul overflow at his home.
   ``Unfortunately he wanted to exterminate the creature and would
have gotten a permit to do so if it weren't for our intervention,''
she said.
   Ms. Marion alerted a group that specialized in beaver behavior
and they were able to scare off the animal without harming it.
   In another case, a student objected to experiments on marsh
turtles at his community college. Upon Ms. Marion's investigation,
the labs were closed because they weren't registered with the state
Health Department.
   ``I've always had a love for animals and a deep concern over how
many of them were homeless. I eventually ended up going to law
school because of it,'' said Ms. Marion, who allows two big dogs
and five ``loveable'' cats to frolic in her Queens home.
   She attended Seton Hall University Law School, where she studied
environmental law. Today, she teaches animal law at Pace University.
   When she opened her practice in 1984, her office was in her
living room. Now, she and four part-time interns _ assisted by 20
volunteer attorneys on call around the country _ work out of a 42nd
Street office donated by United Action for Animals, an animal
advocacy group.
   Although she has prosecuted people-animal cases, Ms. Marion says
most of the time litigation isn't necessary. ``It's more a matter
of the law and a person's constitutional rights,'' she said.
   For example, she took up the case of a high school student who
refused to dissect a frog; she claimed that the student's First
Amendment rights were at issue. Ultimately, an alternate assignment
was made.
   Ms. Marion said there are few malpractice cases against
veterinarians, but courts have become willing to grant punitive
damages for emotional distress to owners whose animals died in
veterinary care.
   ``There is very little on the books for animal rights. But
courts are very sympathetic to animal cases; judges are beginning
to realize that animals are not just inanimate objects,'' said Ms.
Marion.

<HEAD>Tape Said to Show Nicaraguan Link to Salvadoran Left</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are touting a smuggled
videotape purporting to show Salvadoran guerilla leaders at a
training base outside Managua as evidence of Nicaraguan complicity
in El Salvador's insurgency.
   But Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco
dismissed the tape as a ``propaganda show'' that represents another
U.S. effort to blame Nicaragua for the Salvadoran civil war. Tinoco
is in Washington for cease-fire negotiations with the Contra rebels.
   U.S. officials who showed the tape to reporters Monday said
three men who appear in the videotape are top Salvadoran guerrilla
commanders, including Joaquin Villalobos, generally regarded as the
most important figure in the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, or FMLN, insurgent hierarchy.
   The U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the light
artillery and anti-aircraft weapons shown have been used
extensively by rebels during recent fighting in El Salvador but had
not been seen before this spring.
   The tape is believed to have been made in either May or June of
this year and was turned over to American authorities by a person
who wished to remain anonymous, said U.S. officials.
   It was not disclosed who made the tape or what the purpose was.
The original tape was said to be more than three hours long but the
officials said the final product was reduced to the five minutes.
They said it underscored the Sandinista connection with the FMLN.
   The officials said some of the same types of weapons shown on
the tape were used by the FMLN rebels in an October 30 attack on
Salvadoran Army headquarters and the Nov. 11 attacks on the private
and official residences of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani.
   U.S. analysts concluded the site of the taping was the El
Tempisque training site north of Managua because of the terrain and
the presence of Soviet weapons found nowhere else in Latin America
besides Cuba.
   The tape was described by a U.S. official as ``graphic
confirmation'' that the Nicaraguan government has provided weapons
training to the FMLN.
   Nicaraguan officials have said there may have been some
unauthorized operations carried out by Sandinista officials in
support of the FMLN in the early 1980's but that these activities
have long since stopped.
   President Daniel Ortega has said repeatedly Nicaraguan territory
will not be used to subvert neighboring countries.
   U.S. officials have cited the alleged Sandinista support, dating
back almost a decade, as a principal reason for generous U.S.
military support for the Salvadoran government.
   As further evidence of Nicaraguan cooperation with the FMLN, the
administration has said that on Oct. 18 it captured large
quantities of weapons allegedly earmarked by the Sandinistas for
the FMLN. The arms were said to be found by Honduran security
guards aboard a truck near the border with Nicaragua.

   A storm packing near-hurricane force gusts
that slammed into the Washington area knocked out power to some
20,000 area homes and intruded on the Denver Broncos-Washington
Redskins game by taking footballs off their paths in midair.
   Wind gusts up to 73 mph were reported in Washington by the
National Weather Service. They were part of a strong cold front
that bulled its way into the eastern seaboard Monday night and
knocked down trees and sent live power wires into streets.
   An estimated 15,000 customers were without power in the District
of Columbia and Prince George's and Montgomery counties in
Maryland, said Nancy Moses, a spokeswoman for Potomac Electric
Power Co.
   Virginia Power officials estimated 4,000 to 6,000 homes were
without power early today.
   Most of the outages were caused by trees and tree limbs that
tumbled across power lines, officials said.
   At Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, trash tossed by the wind
littered the field for the Monday night National Football League
game between the Redskins and the Broncos. The winds carried thrown
and kicked balls around the field.
   The National Weather Service predicted sustained winds of 30 to
40 mph would continue through the night and gusts would approach 60
mph.
   The winds were brought by a cold front that caused temperatures
to plummet 16 degrees in an hour. Unseasonable weather near 70
degrees plunged to 50 degrees at 10 p.m.
   The weather service classifies sustained winds of at least 74
mph as carrying hurricane force.

<TEXT>
   An Australian who was adopted by
missionaries was convicted of murdering an interior decorator in a
case whose notoriety enabled him to be reunited with his biological
mother.
   James Hudson Savage, convicted Monday of first-degree murder,
robbery and sexual battery, could be sentenced to die in the
electric chair when the jury returns Dec. 11 for the penalty phase.
   Savage, 26, was adopted in Australia when he was 4 months old
and brought to America at age 7.
   His biological mother, Beverley Moore Whyman, who learned of his
whereabouts because of the case, contended he was wrongly taken
from her under a discontinued government program to turn aborigine
children over to white adoptive parents.
   ``They took my son away from me 26 years ago, and they just
killed me tonight,'' said the weeping Ms. Whyman. ``My son is
paying for his own mistakes and for the Australian government's
mistakes.''
   Two benches behind Ms. Whyman, Savage's adoptive mother, Nesta
Savage, wiped tears from her eyes and clung to her husband, Graeme,
as the verdict was read. The couple, who returned from missionary
work in Australia to attend the trial, refused comment.
   The Brevard County Circuit Court jury, which deliberated for
eight hours before announcing the verdicts, has the option of
recommending life in prison or death.
   Savage, who has a long criminal record in this country, was
accused of sexually assaulting and strangling Barbara Ann Barber of
Melbourne in an alley behind her interior design showroom on Nov.
23, 1988.
   His attorney, George Turner, acknowledged that Savage killed Ms.
Barber, but argued the charge should be reduced to second-degree
murder, which carries a maximum term of life imprisonment. Savage's
heavy use of crack reduced his culpability, argued Turner, who also
denied the defendant raped Ms. Barber.
   But Assistant State Attorney Russ Bausch said the murder
couldn't be blamed on drugs.
   ``I don't care if you are black, white, an American, an
Australian or an aborigine,'' Bausch said. ``No one has the right
to perform or commit the criminal actions James Savage committed on
Barbara Ann Barber last year.''
   Aboriginal activists in Australia _ who raised money to send Ms.
Savage to the trial _ want him returned to his homeland, where he
wouldn't face the death penalty.
   The Australian government hasn't decided if it will seek a role
in the penalty phase of the trial, said Australian Consul Ira
Lindeman, who attended the week-long trial.
   Before the trial, Judge Lawrence Johnston allowed a defense
motion that Savage be referred to as Russell Thomas Moore, his
birth name. Turner contended the name Savage might cause the jury
to think of ``an uncivilized primitive.''
   Savage has served four prison sentences for car theft, burglary
and violent behavior in prison, including trying to kill a fellow
inmate and a guard.
   Mrs. Barber's son, Bill, said the family was pleased by Monday's
verdict.
   ``Yes, I want him to get the electric chair,'' Barber said.

   James Cason, whose selection by President Bush
for a top environmental post was turned away by the Senate, has
asked the White House to withdraw his nomination.
   Cason's request, announced Monday, effectively ends an
eight-month battle between Bush and environmentalists over Cason's
nomination for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural
resources and the environment.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who announced Cason's
request, said the ``lobbying effort against him was both misguided
and unfair.''
   There was no immediate response from the White House, which
never wavered in its support of Cason despite repeated requests
from individual senators to withdraw the nomination.
   Environmentalists alleged that Cason's record in several top
Interior Department positions during the Reagan administration
showed favoritism toward private development of public lands.

   The Energy Department is telling scientists
designing the super collider to keep the particle accelerator
within the original standards and at its $5.9 billion price tag,
despite a ``conceptual flaw.''
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said the agency has no
plans to move the collider from Texas, contrary to a published
report that suggested a change in the SSC design could result in a
smaller, less powerful collider that would be unsuitable for its
chosen Ellis County site.
   ``As far as we're concerned, nothing's changed,'' Moore said
Monday after meeting with two Texas Republicans, Sen. Phil Gramm
and Rep. Joe Barton. ``We have no official reports, requests,
proposals any different than we're going to build the super
collider right there in Texas for $5.9 billion.''
   The Washington Post, in a front page story Sunday, quoted
unnamed U.S. officials and independent scientists who said
extensive modifications could reopen the battle for the particle
accelerator by allowing other states to argue that Texas is no
longer the ideal site.

<HEAD>Report: Rural Emergency Services Plagued by Lack of Resources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More federal money and better state planning
could ease some of the problems that plague emergency medical
services in rural areas, according to a congressional research
report.
   The report, released Monday by the Office of Technology, said
emergency medical services in many rural areas suffer from
personnel shortages, inadequate training, outdated equipment and
lack of financial and medical resources.
   Federal funds for emergency medical services reached about $30
million annually after passage of the 1973 EMS Systems Act, but
began to decline in 1981 when the money was folded into block grant
programs. In 1988, about $18 million in federal funds went to the
states for such services.

   A former mental patient apologized for killing
and raping a pregnant doctor in her hospital office before a judge
sentenced him to 50 years to life in prison, the toughest penalty
allowed for the crimes.
   Steven Smith, 23, showed no reaction when Judge James Leff on
Monday imposed the maximum penalty for the rape, sodomy, robbery
and murder of Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, 33, who was five months pregnant.
   Hinnant, originally from Lake City, S.C., was found by her
husband and a Bellevue Hospital official smeared with blood in her
Bellevue office on Jan. 8.
   Smith, a homeless man who had walked the halls of Bellevue in
physician's clothing, claimed he was insane. He will be 73 before
he is eligible for parole.
   ``I'm sorry and it shouldn't have happened,'' Smith said at the
sentencing. ``There was a lot of things going on that I didn't see
or feel, or anything like that.''
   The defense admitted from the outset that Smith had killed
Hinnant but argued he was innocent because of insanity.
   Assistant District Attorney James Kindler recited Smith's arrest
history, including his assaults of teachers as a teen-ager, his
near-fatal beating of his pregnant girlfriend in South Carolina in
March 1988, and his assault of a correction officer after his
arrest in Hinnant's slaying.
   Leff ordered the sentence without comment.
   Smith was arrested for the murder at a men's shelter after his
acquaintances there turned him in, hoping to collect a $30,000
reward. The money has not been awarded so far.

   Hundreds of ballot boxes, thousands of
gallons of ink, batallions of police, and even homing pigeons were
transported to polling centers today for elections in the world's
most populous democracy.
   Opinion polls indicate Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress
Party could lose power in the voting, which begins Wednesday. It
faces a loose-knit opposition coalition of five parties led by
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, once among Gandhi's closest allies.
   The voting for a new Parliament follows a hectic, often bitter
three-week campaign highlighted by charges of government
corruption. It was punctuated by violence that left 27 people dead
across the nation.
   Fifteen of India's 25 states and five of its seven
federally-ruled territories vote Wednesday. The rest of the country
goes to the polls Friday and Sunday.
   At least 3.7 million government officials will supervise voting
at 600,000 polling centers. A total of 524 seats in the Lok Sabha,
or the House of the People, are at stake and there are 6,090
candidates. Nearly 500 million people are eligible to vote.
   With only a literacy rate of 36 percent in a nation of 880
million people, voters will choose candidates by stamping symbols
representing each candidate. The left forefinger of each voter is
then marked with indelible ink to signify that he or she has voted.
   In the eastern regions in Orissa state, authorities have trained
pigoens to carry messages from remote regions to the state police
control.
   The paramilitary Central Reserve Police issued instructions to
carefully watch people wearing shawls or blankets ``in case they
are carrying weapons or bombs underneath.''
   At least 100,000 people from the force will be deployed in
addition to regular police.
   Gandhi, a former airline pilot, succeeded his mother, Indira
Gandhi, after she was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct.
31, 1984. Two months later, he and the Congress Party won an
unprecedented 415 of the 543 seats in Parliament.
   But his government has been haunted for more than two years by
charges of high-level corruption, and his popularity has plunged.
   Opposition leaders have made much of a $1.4 billion artillery
contract signed in 1986 with Bofors, the Swedish arms manufacturer.
They and Indian newspapers say senior government officials received
up to $50 million in kickbacks in the 1986 deal. Gandhi has
repeatedly denied the charges.
   Singh served as finance and defense minister under Gandhi but
left the government in 1987 after ordering an investigation into a
defense deal. He was later expelled from the Congress Party.
   Opinion polls suggest Gandhi's party might need the support of
Hindu fundamentalists or Communists to form the next government.
   The Congress Party, which spearheaded the struggle that
culminated in independence 42 years ago, has won the majority of
Parliament seats in seven elections.
   In 1977, however, the traditionally fractious opposition united
to oust Congress. But that government fell apart 29 months later,
and Congress came back to power in the 1980 elections.
   This year, major opposition parties again united but many voters
still have doubts about the durability.
   This year, voting will not be held in the 14 seats in the
northeastern state of Assam, where voters' lists are not ready.
Polls for four other seats have been postponed because of the
deaths of candidates. In one constituency, a candidate was returned
unopposed.

<HEAD>Peru Closes Border to Stop Dollar Speculators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has closed its road borders
with Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador to slow the flight of dollars after
they soared to a record high on the black market as a hedge against
galloping inflation.
   Officials took the measure late Monday after the black-market
dollar hit an unprecedented high earlier in the day. It was selling
on the street for 11,200 Peruvian intis after opening the day at
9,200.
   Finance Minister Cesar Vasquez Bazan said in a television
interview Monday afternoon, ``There is no objective reason for the
rise.''
   Vasquez Bazan had said then the government would consider
closing the Chilean border and enforcing stricter customs
regulations to stop the ``double profits'' of speculators ``who
make money on the dollar and then make money on the contraband''
they bring back to Peru.
   He said many speculators cross the border into Chile with
dollars and buy consumer goods to sell in Peru.
   Victor Urbiola, prefect of the department of Puno 610 miles
southeast of Lima, said by telephone on Monday night that the
measure originally adopted for the Chilean border was extended to
cover the Bolivian and Ecuadorean borders.
   Urbiola said the two main roads into Bolivia were closed to
traffic Monday night.
   A spokesperson for the department of Tacna, 700 miles southeast
of Lima, confirmed late Monday that the Chilean border had been
closed.
   Officials did not say how long the closures would last.
   In the past two weeks, the price of the dollar has nearly
doubled on the black market. Many people in Peru buy black-market
dollars to offset the country's hyperinflation, and many businesses
obtain dollars to pay for imports on the black market.
   The inflation rate for 1988 was more than 1,700 percent, and
this year it is expected to top 3,000 percent.
   The official exchange rate, which is used only for some
government transactions and to pay for certain imports, was 4,557
intis to the dollar Monday.

<HEAD>Proposals Aired for Overcoming Japanese Lead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nationwide schooling system for 4-year-olds
of poor U.S. families and ending or cutting income taxes on savings
would help restore American leadership in semiconductors, according
to a report.
   After originating the semiconductor industry and dominating it
for three decades, the United States has lost the lead to Japan and
has not responded to the challenge of regaining it, said the first
report of the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors.
   The body created by Congress last year is made up of industrial
executives and government experts under the chairmanship of Ian M.
Ross, president of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.
   The report issued Monday also proposed resurrecting the U.S.
consumer electronics industry with seed money from
government-guaranteed investments to help provide incentives and
affordable capital needed for a major research and development
efforts.
   A nationwide preschool educational system for economically
disadvantaged 4-year-olds would be a step toward improving the
quality of worker education, the report said.
   ``For every dollar invested in quality preschool, seven are
returned to society during the lifetime of the child in the form of
increased earnings, less crime and less welfare,'' the committee
said.
   It also recommended subsidized literacy programs, permanent tax
concessions for research and easing of limits on tax-free
retirement savings accounts known as IRAs.
   The 30-page report also included recommendations for overtaking
Japan in semiconductors such as pressure for reciprocal treatment
in market access, threat of sanctions against unfair trade and
relaxing of U.S. antitrust laws.
   Ironically, many of the recommendations paralleled Japanese
advice for sharpening U.S. competitiveness in the two countries'
ongoing economic structural talks, such as better education and
higher savings.
   If the U.S. position in semiconductors continues to deteriorate,
the U.S. electronics industry will be at the mercy of foreign
suppliers, jeopardizing millions of jobs, billions of dollars of
tax revenue, industrial strength and national defense, the report
said.
   The shift to importing most U.S. consumer electronics items such
as television sets and audio equipment from Asia has been
underrated as a factor in deterioration of semiconductor
leadership, the study said.
   It said the government should take the lead in establishing a
for-profit Consumer Electronics Capital Corporation to resurrect
the domestic industry with a multi-billion dollar pool of low-cost,
long-term private investments.

   Buck Helm, the longshoreman who became a
symbol of hope after the Northern California earthquake, had an
undiagnosed heart ailment that made his long fight for life all the
more incredible, his doctor said.
   Helm, who suffered injuries to virtually every organ in his body
when his car was crushed under the collapsing upper deck of
Interstate 880, had an enlarged ventricle discovered in an autopsy,
Dr. Tom McDonald said Monday.
   Helm, 58, died Saturday after a 28-day fight for his life,
including four days trapped in his compact car.
   ``The fact that he lived the four days he did (on the freeway)
was a miracle,'' McDonald said. ``The fact that he had to handle it
with a bad heart is even more of a miracle.''
   For many who survived the Oct. 17 quake _ which measured 7.1 on
the Richter scale, killed 67 and did $7 billion in damage _ the
Interstate 880 survivor embodied hopes for recovery.
   The defect in Helm's ventricle, a chamber in the heart that
pumps blood to the arteries, was undetectable while Helm was alive,
said McDonald, chief of surgery at Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center, one of the hospitals where Helm was treated.
   The heart problem combined with a fast-spreading blood infection
to kill Helm, McDonald said.
   A bacterial infection entered his blood with the rupture of an
abscess in an abdominal wound that may have been caused by the
seat-belt buckle of his car, McDonald said. The heart, already
weakend by the defect, got infected.
   McDonald said he had been optimistic about Helm's recovery but
admitted that much of his attitude was founded on hope. He called
Helm's injuries ``overwhelming.''
   Helm, who commuted 250 miles to rural from the Oakland to rural
Weaverville to visit his family on weekends, was trapped in his
crushed car for 89 hours.
   Funeral services were scheduled for this afternoon in
Weaverville.
   Helm is survived by his former wife, Lorrie, and four children:
Jeff, 16; Marc, 22; Desiree, 12; and Greg, 35.

   A small earthquake rattled parts of
this Southern California city, but no injuries or damage were
reported.
   The quake measuring 2.9 on the Richter scale struck at 10:48
a.m. Monday and was centered 17 miles south of Riverside, said Hall
Daily, a spokesman for the California Institute of Technology.
   ``It was very small,'' said Daily. ``We only got a few calls
about it,''
   Riverside is about 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

<HEAD>Two Federal Nuclear Plants to Lay Off Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 325 employees at the Department of
Energy's Y-12 nuclear weapons plant will be getting layoff notices
within the next week, plant officials said.
   Also, operators of the federal Fernald uranium processing plant
in Ohio announced about 130 workers are being laid off.
   The Tennessee layoffs at the 6,900-employee plant are the result
of a $7 million cut in its $590 million fiscal 1990 budget, said
Robert Wesley, spokesman for Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc.
   Martin Marietta, which manages the plant under a DOE contract,
said last week that Gramm-Rudman cuts could chop an additional $20
million to $25 million from the Y-12 budget, causing more layoffs.
   Wesley said Monday it could be weeks before it's known whether
the plant will have to absorb Gramm-Rudman reductions.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, which operates the DOE's
Feed Materials Production Center, said its layoffs of production
workers take effect Dec. 15.
   Plant spokeman Bob Walker said Westinghouse anticipates a $6
million shortfall in its fiscal 1990 budget. He said if Congress
enacts additional reductions, more layoffs at could follow.
   Production at the plant near Fernald, an unincorporated
community 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati, has been suspended
while the site undergoes inspection and cleanup.
   A Westinghouse statement said the company has no schedule for
restart of uranium processing ``in the near future.''
   The 38-year-old plant processes uranium for use in Energy
Department nuclear reactors elsewhere in the government's
production of nuclear weapons.
   Westinghouse suspended production in July to concentrate on
cleaning up the plant's 1,050-acre site, where thousands of pounds
of radioactive wastes are stored in steel drums and ground pits.
   Environmentalists say the plant and its radioactive wastes and
emissions threaten the atmosphere and the Great Miami River
aquifer, a regional water resource.

   Rain dampened parts of Seattle and Maine early today, hours
after strong winds and thunderstorms knocked out power to tens of
thousands of people from Ohio to New York.
   A winter storm warning was posted for today in parts of
Michigan, with up to a foot of snow possible over the snow belt of
upper Michigan. Strong, gusty winds with cold temperatures were
expected to bring wind chills down to 15 below zero over northern
lower Michigan and to 20 below zero over upper Michigan.
   A snow squall warning has been posted over extreme northeast
Ohio. Up to 7 inches of snow could fall today east of Cleveland.
   In northeast Ohio Monday night, more than 25,000 people were
without electricity as winds gusting up to 54 mph downed power
lines.
   In metropolitan New York, winds gusting up to 100 mph damaged
four parked airplanes, blasted bricks off buildings and snapped
trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity.
   Three Pan American airplanes parked outside a hangar at John F.
Kennedy International Airport were severely damaged by winds
gusting up to 44 mph, said Lt. Kevin Hassett, a spokesman for the
Port Authority police.
   At Newark International Airport in New Jersey, a parked
Continental 727 was picked up off the ground and dropped on a fuel
truck and some baggage carts, injuring a worker inside the craft's
baggage area.
   Elsewhere Monday, thunderstorm winds gusted to 85 mph in central
Pennsylvania at York and State College, bringing down trees and
tearing off roofs. More than 80,000 people lost power throughout
the state.
   ``I heard a terrible rip and I saw the piece of roof come down
past the window,'' said Ellen Morris of York. ``I knew the wind had
taken the roof off. I was hoping I wasn't heading for Oz.''
   In western New York, winds gusted to 81 mph at Jamestown, and up
to 10,000 people in the Buffalo metropolitan area lost power,
officials said.
   Snow fell over northern New England Monday evening, while
showers and thunderstorms extended from central New England across
much of New York state and northeast Pennsylvania.
   Rain also dampened the northern Pacific Coast and the upper
Texas Gulf Coast, while scattered snow fell over parts of Michigan,
northwest Wisconsin and northeast Minnesota.
   Some areas enjoyed unseasonably high temperatures Monday. High
temperature records for the date included 82 degrees at Fort Smith,
Ark., and 75 degrees in San Francisco.
   The high temperature for the nation Monday was 91 degrees at
Northridge, Calif.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oil and mining services company that
is purchasing The Anchorage Times promised not to interfere with
news coverage but said the editorial pages would be pro-development.
   ``Through being a pro-development paper, maybe we can create
more jobs,'' said William Allen, chairman of the board of VECO
International. ``People can't stay up here (Alaska) unless they
have jobs.''
   Longtime owner Bob Atwood said he sold the evening newspaper
he's owned since 1935 to the VECO because he wanted to keep
Alaska's No. 2 paper in local hands.
   Documents to complete the deal were signed Monday by the
82-year-old Atwood and Allen, who said negotiations for the
purchase began about 1{ years ago.
   The price was not disclosed. The sale is to become final Dec. 14.
   Allen said he did not see any conflict with his political
activities, or with VECO's role as chief contractor for the Prince
William Sound oil spill cleanup.
   ``Owning the paper is not going to change my political views.
Any candidate I think is pro-development I'm probably going to
support. But the paper will not be supporting my political
beliefs,'' Allen said.
   The newspaper, which celebrates its 75th anniversary next year
and is as old as Anchorage, will remain the only locally owned and
operated daily paper in Alaska's largest city.
   ``It would have been a tragedy to have outside interests control
both newspapers in Anchorage,'' he said, referring to the Anchorage
Daily News, a Pulitzer Prize-winning morning newspaper owned by
California-based McClatchy Newspapers group.
   ``You'll see a change in the looks of the Times, the content of
the Times, beginning in January,'' Allen said. ``We'll keep the
same editorial philosophy. We're going to put the facts on the
front page and editorialize on the editorial page.
   ``There's not going to be any interference in the newsroom,''
Allen said. ``They can report on VECO as they have in the past. All
I ask is a more accurate story.''
   VECO chafed at the coverage of its lengthy battle with the
Alaska Public Offices Commission for the company's payroll plan for
campaign contributions.
   Atwood said he sold the Times to make it strong enough to
compete with the McClatchy group.
   The Times, first was published in a tent during the construction
of the Alaska Railroad, was long the dominant paper but now is No.
2 in circulation. The newspaper's circulation is 34,080 daily and
44,062 on Sundays, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations'
Sept. 30 figures. The News' circulation is 57,671 daily and 73,337
on Sundays.
   VECO is buying the Times' assets but not The Anchorage Times
Publishing Co., which will continue to be owned by Atwood.
   Allen said his company will commit substantial resources to the
newspaper to expand state and local coverage.
   Editor-in-Chief Bill Tobin has expressed a desire to
``semi-retire'' but will help during the transition, Allen said.
Atwood will become publisher emeritus, and Times General Manager
William J. Hofer will become president and chief operating officer.

<HEAD>U.N. Official: Donors Unhappy With Afghan Government's Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Western governments are withholding
aid the Afghan people urgently need because they oppose the
communist Kabul government and want to help precipitate its
downfall, a U.N. official says.
   Western donors had been counting on the swift defeat of the
government following the Soviet military pullout, completed in
February, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan told reporters Monday.
   ``They were taken by surprise that after the 15th of February,
after the last of the foreign troops withdrew, that somehow a
change in Kabul did not occur very quickly,'' said the prince, who
coordinates Operation Salam, the U.N. relief program for
Afghanistan.
   He said a reluctance to donate has prolonged the suffering of
Afghans and discouraged the return of 5 million refugees from
Pakistan and Iran.
   ``Why should they go back if their conditions outside are still
better than those that they would find inside?'' he asked.
   The prince said many Western donors disapprove of President
Najib's communist government and believe sending aid into
Afghanistan will help prop up his administration.
   ``In point of fact, a very large part of the country, which is
rural, is controlled by the opposition, by the resistance,'' he
said. ``Two-thirds of the country is gradually returning to normal.
   ``The needs are comparatively greater in those areas, so by
transferring aid to needy Afghan groups in areas controlled by the
resistance, you would not be shoring up the government in Kabul,''
said the prince.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar appealed last
year for $1.2 billion for Afghan aid and reconstruction.
   The prince said the Western governments ``have not been
extremely generous in responding to the secretary-general's appeal
so far.''
   His latest report, issued Monday, shows Moscow has pledged about

   Adventure novelist William Wister Haines,
whose World War II-era work ``Command Decision'' was made into a
1949 movie starring Clark Gable, has died of a stroke. He was 81.
   Haines died Saturday aboard the cruise ship Island Princess off
Acapulco, his daughter, Mrs. Murray J. Belman, said Monday.
   Haines was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He wrote his first novel,
``Slim,'' in 1934, three years after graduating from the University
of Pennsylvania.
   He then traveled west to Hollywood.
   Later he wrote ``High Tension,'' published in 1938 and then
``Command Decision,'' based on his play that originally appeared in
serialized form in the Atlantic magazine.
   The play, first produced in Cleveland in 1946, moved to Broadway
in 1948.
   Other novels include ``Ultra,'' ``The Winter War,'' and ``The
Image.''
   His screenwriting credits include ``Alibi Ike,'' ``The Black
Legion,'' ``The Texans,'' ``Beyond Glory,'' ``The Racket,'' ``One
Minute to Zero,'' ``The Eternal Sea,'' ``The Wings of Eagles'' and
``Torpedo Run.''
   He is survived by his daughter, his wife, Frances, a son and
four grandsons.

   Sylvester Stallone sure wouldn't have played
it that way.
   Rocky Balboa fought in Philadelphia on Monday night. But he
lost, in a bout so devoid of drama it was stopped by the referee in
the fifth round.
   The story of Jaime ``Rocky'' Balboa has little in common with
the Philadelphia prizefighter Stallone played in the 1976 smash
movie hit ``Rocky'' and its sequels.
   For one thing, the real ``Rocky'' is a welterweight not a
heavyweight.
   He didn't train by slugging sides of beef in a Philly meat
locker, slogging up the steps of the Art Museum or through the
Italian Market on Ninth Street. And when he yells ``Yo,'' he means
``I.''
   The 27-year-old Balboa is a native of Mexico who's now from San
Antonio.
   About the only parallel with the movie that launched Stallone's
movie career is that the real Rocky also was an underdog. The man
who beat him, Meldrick Taylor, is an Olympic gold medalist and
unbeaten Junior Welterweight champ of the International Boxing
Federation.
   Taylor, who is from the City of Brotherly Love, seemed to
appreciate the irony.
   ``I think it's kind of sassy for Rocky Balboa to come to
Philadelphia and challenge me,'' said Taylor, who dominated the
fight from the outset.
   When Taylor connected with two lefts in the fifth round, not
even Mickey the trainer or the lovely Adrian could have saved
Balboa, who says he was known as Rocky before anyone ever heard of
Sylvester Stallone.
   ``A long time ago when I'd get together with my friends and
fight they said I hit real hard,'' he said. ``They started calling
me Rocky.''

<HEAD>A Revival of `The Circle' Starring Rex Harrison on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with opinions from other critics; no
PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Star performances can enliven the creakiest of
drawing room comedies, making the artifical and old-fashioned seem
charming, funny and even poignant.
   That is the case at the Ambassador Theater where Rex Harrison,
Stewart Granger and particularly Glynis Johns resuscitate W.
Somerset Maugham's ``The Circle,'' a hit from the 1921-22 Broadway
season. If it weren't for this stylish trio of veterans, the play,
which opened Monday night, would be little more than lightweight
stuff.
   For nearly a half-hour after the curtain rises on designer
Desmond Heeley's opulent, flower-filled drawing room, Maugham sets
up the plot, laboriously laying out the gossipy past. He tells how
30 years ago, the beautiful Lady Kitty ran off with the great Lord
Porteous, leaving behind her husband Clive and 5-year-old son,
Arnold.
   Now, three decades later, Arnold's head-strong but romantic
wife, Elizabeth, has invited the errant mother and her lover for
lunch. Of course, Kitty's ex-husband will be there, too, so the
prospects of an uncomfortable reunion are downright certain.
   To add to the embarrassment, history may repeat itself.
Elizabeth has fallen for another houseguest, Teddy, a handsome
colonialist from Malaysia. The plot turns on whether Elizabeth will
run off with Teddy, making the same decision her mother-in-law made
so many years ago.
   That is the principal plot development, but there is more fun in
watching the aging lovers quarrel, renew their relationships and
sharpen the points of their decades-old triangle.
   Harrison, as the elderly playboy Lord Porteous, resembles a
blinking British Buddha, ever so polite and perplexed as he lumbers
about the stage. He's still in love with the woman he ran away with
30 years ago, but ardor can be taken for granted after so long a
time. And life keeps getting in the way.
   Harrison's role is small, almost a throwaway, but the actor is
such a presence that he makes it seem better and bigger than it
really is. No one can growl out a line the way he can.
   Both Porteous and especially Lady Kitty realize what they have
given up for love. He could have been prime minister. She gave up a
devoted husband and young son. Maugham's play makes some
surprisingly serious statements about the tradeoffs that people in
love must make.
   Lady Kitty is the play's most frivolous yet perceptive
character. Old age becomes her enemy, not her ex-husband.
   ``The tragedy of love is indifference,'' she counsels the
distraught Elizabeth. That's why she dyes her gray hair, dresses in
girlish pink and wears a lot of makeup. She won't give up without a
fight.
   Johns is superb. She plays the role delicately, yet with great
comic spirit. She knows just how far to go with Kitty's
scatter-brained comments and actions. And there are genuine tears
when she cries over an old photograph of her much younger self.
   If Granger, as Kitty's long-abandoned husband, can't quite keep
up with the two other stars, he does a credible job. Clive is the
odd man out. But Maugham does not turn the husband into a moper.
And he seems a more satisfied person than the lovers who did him
wrong.
   Director Brian Murray, who supervises things at the slowest
possible pace, has less luck with the triangle of younger lovers.
Roma Downey and Harley Venton are earth-bound as Elizabeth and her
new-found love. Robin Chadwick is prissy and unconvincing as her
husband. You wonder why she married him in the first place.
   But audiences are there to see Harrison, Johns and Granger, and
you feel cheated when the other actors are on too much of the time.
When the stars are center stage, ``The Circle'' seems complete.
When they are not, this drawing room comedy is drawn out far too
long.
   Critic Linda Winer, however, found the play ``creaked and
wheezed a lot and managed to charm quite a bit,'' she wrote in New
York Newsday.
   ``Johns' lilting, autumnal voice is perfect; so is her fragile
sense of duty. Rex Harrison has raised crotchetiness to a great
art. ...Granger has charm in abundance,'' Howard Kissel wrote in
the Daily News.
   When Johns and Harrison argue, The New York Times' Frank Rich
said, ``one feels her bitterness even as one exults in the verbal
chamber music created by two of the most distinctive speaking
voices in the English theater.''
   Critic Clive Barnes, writing in the New York Post, praised the
whole cast, especially Harrison's ``stately and ineffable charm
tinged with a very correct arrogance.''

   The dollar fell early today against all major
currencies in thin European trading. Gold bullion jumped above $400
an ounce in London for the first time in 10 months.
   Foreign exchange dealers said falling U.S. interest rates
brought renewed pressure on the dollar, while the West German mark
benefited from expectations that West German interest rates will
rise.
   ``The dollar looks on the way down,'' said Derek Saville,
foreign exchange manager at Standard Chartered Bank in London.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.24 Japanese yen to a closing 144.43 yen.
Later, in London, it fell further to 144.16 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.8270 West German marks, down from 1.8360
   _1.6260 Swiss francs, down from 1.6315
   _6.2205 French francs, down from 6.2465

   _1,345.75 Italian lire, down from 1,351.00
   _1.1696 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5632 from $1.5595 late
Monday.
   Gold bullion opened in London at a bid price of $397.60 a troy
ounce, up from $396.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $400.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $399.55, up from $396.65 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.21 to close at a bid $398.61.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $5.70 a troy

<TEXT>
   An elephant who had been pregnant for more than
two years was back on her feet after veterinarians completed a
risky Caesarean section to remove a dead fetus.
   Six veterinarians and three equine surgeons at the San Diego
Wild Animal Park spent 5{ hours Monday on the procedure on Jean, a
19-year-old, 7,000-pound Asian elephant who was believed to have
been pregnant for more than 730 days. The normal gestation period
is between 618 and 648 days.
   The Caesarean section was performed as a last resort after Jean
was unable to deliver the 300-pound calf and her system did not
abort the fetus.
   Veterinarians had feared that the elephant could die a slow,
painful death if the decomposing fetus was not removed, park
spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   Park officials will keep Jean in isolation to make sure she does
not contract infections or break her sutures.
   ``She was a little shaky, but she was a good patient during the
anesthesia and she maintained herself very well, including body
temperature and pulse,'' said Dr. Jim Oosterhuis, the park's
director of veterinary services who directed the procedure.
   He said park officials believed it was the first Caesarean
section ever performed on an elephant.
   ``It was very stressful. It was a big procedure and it took a
lot of effort,'' he said. ``There's a good possibility that she
will not be able to breed again and even if she were able to, we
might not want to try to breed her to avoid problems that could
occur from this procedure.''
   The equine surgeons were brought in because of their work with
horses, whose anatomy resembles that of an elephant, Hanscom said.
   After weeks of tests, veterinarians confirmed on Saturday that
Jean was carrying a fetus that died sometime in September.
   The elephant was under general anesthesia for the operation.
After the operation was completed, veterinarians administered a
drug to counteract the anesthesia.
   Five minutes later, Jean stood up on her feet, to the cheer of
the surgical team and other park employees.
   ``We are relieved and quite pleased that she even made it
through today's procedure,'' Hanscom said.

<TEXT>
   Basque separatists taking seats in
Parliament for the first time boycotted its opening ceremonies
today hours after being attacked by masked gunmen, who killed one
deputy and badly wounded another.
   Both houses of Parliament condemned the assassination of
deputy-elect Jon ``Josu'' Muguruza, 31, of the Popular Union party.
He was pronounced dead on arrival Monday night at Gregorio Maranon
hospital after being shot once in the head while dining in a Madrid
restaurant.
   The second deputy, 41-year-old Inaki Esnaola, was in very
serious condition after six hours of surgery, according to a
hospital statement.
   They said Muguruza and Esnaola were with the five other Basque
parliamentarians and three journalists at a table when the gunmen
attacked.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The Popular Union issued a statement blaming the ``Spanish state
apparatus'' and right-wing terrorists. It called for a general
strike Wednesday in the three-province Basque region to protest the
killings.
   Popular Union spokesman Jon Idigoras said the party's two other
deputies and three senators had decided to boycott today's
ceremonies, which they believed should have been canceled following
the assassination.
   But he told reporters that his party, generally considered the
political wing of the armed separatist group ETA, would still
participate in Parliament for the first time since Spain's return
to democracy in 1977.
   ``If they think they're going to intimidate us ... they're
wrong,'' Idigoras said. The politicians were all elected in Oct. 29
voting.
   Popular Union spokesman Xabier Oleaga said on Saturday that the
party Batasuna had decided to take its seats because it believed
there would be new peace negotiations between the government and
ETA.
   He said the party wants to be present in Parliament to present
its side of the issues.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed
more than 600 people. It began its violent campaign for
independence from Spain in 1968.
   Monday's shooting drew condemnation from all major political
parties and the Socialist-led government.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said the attack was ``as
horrendous as all terrorist acts ... and without doubt an attack
against the pacification process'' in the Basque region.
   Government spokeswoman Rosa Conde called it an attack against
democracy and said ``the full weight of the law will fall on those
responsible.''
   Anonymous callers to several radio stations in the Basque region
said today that the attack had been carried out by the
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, a shadowy organization that some
people link to the police.
   In the hours after the attack, police in the Basque region
reported several incidents, including the explosion of a small bomb
outside a branch office of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya bank in the
town of Santurce. The bomb damaged a car but caused no injuries,
they said.
   Molotov cocktails started fires at a train station in the town
of Villabona and a bank in Onate, police said.
   The head of the conservative Popular Party, Jose Maria Aznar,
told reporters he deplored the attack. But he added that the Basque
party's outrage seemed hollow since it had never condemned the
deaths of ETA's victims.
   On Sunday, ETA claimed responsibility for the death of an army
lieutenant colonel gunned down in a car in downtown Madrid last
week. He was the 17th victim of ETA violence this year.
   The Gonzalez government began exploratory peace talks with
exiled ETA leaders in Algeria earlier this year but canceled them
in April when ETA terrorists renewed their attacks.

   Media magnate Ted Turner is offering a $500,000
prize for a novel that promotes solutions to the world's problems.
   The winner of the Turner Tomorrow Award, to be given by Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. and its subsidiary, Turner Publishing
Inc., also will receive a hardcover publishing contract
guaranteeing a minimum printing of 50,000 copies and a $50,000
promotion campaign. It also likely would become a TV movie, Turner
said.
   ``The great minds of today need to focus on the problems of
global significance if humanity is to see new tomorrows,'' Turner
said Monday. ``We're floundering around as a species right now with
piecemeal solutions.''
   The award is larger than the $463,000 given this year for the
Nobel Prize in literature. There aren't any plans to make it an
annual award.
   Winners of four awards of merit will receive $50,000, a
hardcover publication contract and an option for film production.
   Judges include Pulitzer Prize-winning nature author Wallace
Stegner; novelist and naturalist Peter Matthiessen; science fiction
writer Ray Bradbury; William Styron, author of ``Sophie's Choice,''
and Betty and Ian Ballantine, co-founders of Ballantine Books.

<HEAD>Commission Proposes Strict Ethics Code for L.A. Officials</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley
has proposed a tough ethics code he called a model for other
cities. It would ban outside income for officials, limit campaign
spending and require detailed financial disclosure.
   ``Government in this country and in this city is suffering from
a crisis in confidence,'' panel member Margaret M. Morrow said
Monday. ``There's a lack of confidence in the integrity of its
process, its participants and its results.''
   Bradley's own problems with conflict-of-interest allegations led
him to appoint the commission in April after he was elected to an
unprecedented fifth term.
   Bradley would have been in violation of some provisions had the
code been in effect, panel members said.
   Bradley, who would have to sign any ethics plan into law, backed
the package approved unanimously Monday by the seven-member
Commission to Draft an Ethics Code for Los Angeles Government.
   ``They have proposed an ethics code that will pave the way for
other cities across the nation to follow our lead,'' Bradley said
in a statement.
   He promised to work for its passage by the City Council. Some of
the proposals also must be approved by voters citywide because they
would change the City Charter.
   Mike Woo, who heads a council committee considering ethics
reforms, said most recommendations will be approved in some form,
but two _ a permanent ethics commission and public campaign
financing _ have an uncertain future.
   Unlike some state and federal ethics measures, the proposed code
contains no provision to increase pay to make up for its ban on
outside earned income and its strict limits on gifts.
   ``We're convinced that the best way to attract good people to
government is it assure that the government itself will be highly
ethical and that they will be working for an institution that is
worthy of public respect,'' said commission Chairman Geoffrey Cowan.
   It is the panel's proposed ban on outside income for elected
city officials and top decision-makers that Bradley would have
violated, Cowan said. The mayor accepted consulting fees from two
banks that do business in the city.
   There were suggestions he appointed the ethics panel to save
face, but the commission soon declared its independence from the
mayor by obtaining private funding.
   The commission recommended that elected officials and top
appointed officials disclose in detail information about all income
and investments, including their primary home and investments
outside the city.
   The panel also called for giving the city attorney additional
enforcement powers and appointing a special prosecutor in some
cases.
   The city attorney concluded an investigation in September by
filing civil charges against Bradley on allegations the mayor
improperly reported some securities holdings. The mayor still is
under state and federal investigation.

   Helicopters sprayed the San Fernando Valley
against Medflies overnight as agriculture officials lamented a new
infestation threatening fruit crops elsewhere in Southern
California.
   ``The situation is grave,'' said Roy Cunningham, the leading
entomologist on the state's Mediterranean fruit fly advisory panel.
``Nobody wants more spraying, but we have to face the fact that
this is our fallback.''
   Early today, helicopters completed spraying the pesticide
malathion over the San Fernando Valley communities of North
Hollywood, Studio City, Burbank and Toluca Lake, crisscrossing a
12-square-mile section in an effort to eradicate the Medfly, which
ruins fruit and vegetables.
   Before the aerial attack began late Monday, about 15
environmentalists lined up along Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood
encouraging drivers to honk if they were against the spraying.
   ``he purpose of the protest is to increase pressure on public
officials to ban malathion,'' said demonstrator Randall Toller.
   The discovery Monday of a pregnant Medfly in Brea, about 25
miles from downtown Los Angeles, prompted state officials to order
spraying next week in Orange County to protect its $225 million
citrus and nursery industry.
   ``It is a tremendous threat to our industry, said Barbara Buck,
spokeswoman for the Western Growers Association. ``We're sensitive
to public concern, but the Medfly does need to be eradicated.
   In the San Fernando Valley, residents were warned to stay
inside, keep pets indoors and cover their cars against the
pesticide's sticky fly bait, which can harm automobile paint.
   Despite the warnings, officials maintain malathion poses no harm
to people.
   Pesticides have been sprayed over more than 100 square miles in
the four-month Medfly war in Los Angeles County. The fight this
year has cost taxpayers more than $10 million.
   Medflies threaten California's $16 billion farm economy because
they lay eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables,
making them inedible.

   Soviet legislators rejected a Kremlin plan to

   The Soviet legislature, which was reshaped over the past year,
rejected the plan in a vote Monday. It has been taking an

   The government plan was presented to legislators by Deputy
Premier Leonid I. Abalkin, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's top
economic adviser. It would govern relations between Moscow and
local authorities, primarily those in the 15 Soviet republics.
   The official Tass news agency said Abalkin called for a cautious
approach to economic decentralization because of the country's
difficult economic problems.
   ``We are now making only the first steps on the path of the
republics' economic independence,'' Tass quoted him as saying. ``It
is very important not to go to extremes, not to roll into a
dangerous and unjustified separation, and at the same time make a
decisive step from extreme centralization on the Union level.''
   But Deputy V.I. Alksnis said the plan was aimed at shaping a
single, federated government rather than a union of sovereign
governments sought by the Baltic and other republics, Tass said.
   ``Any other variant will lead to an aggravation of inter-ethnic
relations,'' Tass quoted Alksnis as saying.
   ``Rejecting the administrative-command style of managing the
economy, we must recognize that a Moscow bureaucrat is no better
than, for example, one from Riga,'' he added. ``Work collectives
must at last gain the right of full independence from the central
as well as the local apparatus.''
   The Supreme Soviet on Monday also imposed price controls on
several basic consumer goods, including some foods and clothes, and
export controls on scare items like furs, electrical appliances,
and fish products.
   Tass said the deputies imposed the price controls to help
retirees and other low-income groups hard hit by price increases
and shortages of consumer goods.

   Political leaders agreed today on a
short-term government of the country's widely divided major
parties, ending a stalemate produced by inconclusive elections this
month.
   ``The three parties agreed to support a government whose
life-term will last until mid-April,'' conservative leader
Constantine Mitsotakis told a news conference.
   The decision to hold general elections in April follows four
rounds of talks between President Christos Sartzetakis and
conservative, socialist and Communist leaders.
   Mitsotakis said the interim administration will be headed by a
respected former Bank of Greece governor, Xenophon Zolotas, who is
not a member of Parliament.
   The government will include members of all parties and also
non-political personalities, Mitsotakis said. He added that the
details of the Cabinet's make-up still have to be decided.
   He said the administration will tackle pressing economic
problems and negotiations with the United States on whether to
renew an agreement for their bases in Greece.
   Mitsotakis heads the New Democracy party, which in the Nov. 5
elections came just short of winning the parliamentary majority
needed to form a government alone.
   He has since failed to find a coalition partner in either
Andreas Papandreou, the former Socialist premier, or Communist
leader Harilaos Florakis.
   In the balloting, New Democracy took 148 seats in the 300-member
Parliament. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement won 128 and
the Communist coalition garnered 21.
   On June 18, elections also failed to produce a winner. A
conservative-communist government led the country until the
November elections.
   The talks between the party leaders had been deadlocked until
today over a demand by former socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou
that the electoral system be changed before his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement supported any government.
   His proposed change to simple proportional representation would
have made it even harder for any party to win a majority in the
300-member unicameral Parliament. Under the present system, a party
that receives at least 47 percent of the vote can govern alone.
   Mitsotakis rejected the condition. He said party leaders had
agreed that the April elections would be conducted with the
existing electoral system.

   Nevada has cited the Navy for leaving
unexploded bombs on public land outside target ranges.
   Environmental Protection chief Lew Dodgion, who issued the order
Monday against the Fallon Naval Air Station, said he has not
decided whether to seek fines, which could run as high as $10,000
per day per violation.
   Some of the bombs may have been dropped as long as 30 years ago.
No injuries have been reported.
   Capt. Rex Rackowitz, Fallon commander, said some of the bombs
and rockets may have landed outside the fenced ranges because of
inexperienced pilots.
   Other bombs may have skipped across the desert floor for miles
before coming to rest on federal Bureau of Land Management land
outside the ranges, he said.
   The alleged violations of state law include a failure to notify
the state and failure to get a state-approved plan to deal with the
situation.
   ``The order requires them to cease and desist if they aren't
complying with state laws, and to give us some background on when
they discovered this problem,'' Dodgion said.
   Gov. Bob Miller expressed outrage last week that the the bombs
were on public grazing lands for year but there was no effort made
to remove them until recently.
   Fallon has started a cleanup of bombs and bomb fragments near
one practice range, but not two other ranges used by Navy pilots.
The Bureau of Land Management has closed lands it holds around the
ranges pending inspections.
   Dodgion said his order won't stop the cleanup already under way.
   Some of the ordnance, being cleaned up in an exercise nicknamed
Operation Ugly Baby, was found more than a mile outside one bombing
range near Fallon, about 60 miles east of Reno.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is studying
suggestions for ``revolutionary changes'' in America's military _
including cutting 100,000 Army soldiers, getting rid of 100 Navy
ships and closing at least a dozen Air Force bases, Pentagon
sources say.
   Amid the long-range budget planning, a senior Pentagon official
said Monday that Cheney also is considering a budget plan for the
1991 fiscal year that could cut $20 billion from the projected $317
billion spending level.
   ``It could be that bad,'' the official said. ``It could be that
we have to cut that much.''
   Cheney planned to hold a second day of meetings today with
Pentagon chiefs to pore over proposed wide-ranging cutbacks for
1992 to 1994, which some Pentagon insiders say could be the most
sweeping since the end of the Vietnam war.
   While much of the activity is driven by hints of change in the
Soviet threat, the Pentagon also is trying to get ahead of Congress
in planning for the nearly inevitable budget squeeze, officials say.
   ``Mr. Cheney has no intention of going up to Capitol Hill and
having his budget thrown back in his face,'' Defense Department
spokesman Pete Williams said Monday. ``This is going to be a very
painful process for everyone.''
   Some congressional sources, however, said they are wary about
the Pentagon projections of major force cuts, suggesting the
numbers may be overstated to grab the limelight from lawmakers who
have been warning the Pentagon to tighten its belt.
   The Pentagon expects to submit its 1991 spending projection to
the Office of Management and Budget by Dec. 8, the official said.
   Last week, Cheney ordered the military chiefs of the Army, Navy
and Air Force to produce ``worst-case'' budget cuts designed to
slash projected spending, including earlier-anticipated increases,
by $180 billion over the three-year period from fiscal 1992 through
1994.
   ``These are revolutionary changes,'' said one knowledgeable
military source. ``Mr. Cheney is really trying to shake the service
chiefs out. He wants their backs pressed to the wall, telling him
exactly what it is they can give up. He wants their grimmest
scenarios.''
   The Army has told Cheney it could cut, over a five-year period,
as many as 100,000 soldiers, which could translate into ``at least
several divisions,'' said one Pentagon official.
   ``We're mostly people. The other forces can cut their expensive
weapons, but our money is in our folks,'' the officials said.
``We'd like to make sure that if we have to have fewer units, we
want to have the best we can get.''
   The Navy has said its ``worst case'' could envision a cut of up
to 100 ships _ bringing the number down to 466 and dashing the
dreams of the previous administration's 600-ship Navy, one Navy
source said.
   Other proposals include mothballing the service's four World War
II-era battleships; cutting the number of aircraft carriers from
the current 15 to 10 or 12; and getting rid of 20 to 30 flight
squadrons, the source said.
   Another Pentagon official said the Air Force has suggested
cutting at least 12 bases, stretching out purchases of the B-2
stealth bomber and eliminating five fighter wings.
   The review also will require the Air Force to take another look
at its proposal for two new mobile missiles _ the rail-based MX and
the smaller, truck-based Midgetman, the source said.
   On Monday, Cheney held more than four hours of conferences with
his civilian advisors, the military chiefs of staff and Joint
Chiefs Chairman Gen. Colin Powell to review the military's
suggestions.
   Williams said Cheney had not made any decisions about the
reported suggestions.
   He called the activity a ``budget exercise'' designed to force
the Pentagon to respond to the changes occurring under Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev and the budget pressures of the
nation's deficit.
   Williams said it was clear to the Pentagon leadership that
President Bush's earlier projections for 1 percent spending
increases for fiscal 1991 and 1992, followed by 2 percent increases
in 1993 and 1994, aren't realistic anymore.

<HEAD>Top Economists Meet; Government Says Economy Collapsing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top economists today began debating the
pro-market economic program of the Solidarity-led government, which
described the Polish economy as on the brink of collapse.
   More than 400 economists representing the 55,000 members of the
Polish Economic Society convened for a two-day meeting in the city
of Lodz, the official PAP news agency said.
   The building, energy and agriculture sectors are among those
reporting a drop in production, according to economic indicators
for October released Monday by the main statistical office, known
by its Polish initials GUS.
   A total of 5,500 apartment buildings were completed in October,
15.7 percent less than in October 1988, the government said.
Between January and October of this year 65,200 apartments were
made available to the public, 18.2 percent less than last year.
   Poles sometimes have to wait more than 20 years for apartments.
A chronic housing shortage was a major public grievance against the
Communist regime, which lost control of the government in August
after more than 40 years in power.
   With winter approaching, production in the fuel and power
industry was down 1.6 percent and coal production was down 10.7
percent from the same period in 1988, the report said.
   The October inflation rate was put at 54.8 percent. The annual
inflation rate is now estimated at over 700 percent.
   The Cabinet met until late Monday night to continue work on the
1990 budget following a visit by the representatives of the
International Monetary Fund to Warsaw in October, PAP said.
   Its prognosis was grim.
   ``At present Poland's economy is on the brink of collapse. This
state, as well as the experience of other countries, exclude the
possibility of gradual overcoming of such a profound crisis,'' PAP
said in a report on the Cabinet meeting.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former Solidarity editor
who became the first non-Communist prime minister in the East bloc
on Aug. 24, already has appealed to coal miners to work Saturdays
to make up for shortfalls in coal production.
   PAP said Monday that miners had responded to the appeal and
extracted 116,000 more tons of coal last Saturday than on an
average Saturday for the last three months.
   A commentary in the pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza today
criticized the economic program, saying its goals exceeded the
government's means.
   ``The government program sounds innovative for it uses
formulations from the arsenal of a market economy. Only it is not
possible to implement it for the goals it outlines do not
correspond to the instruments,'' the newspaper said.
   Mazowiecki has stressed the need for quick implementation of the
reforms, but the government is learning that it takes time to pass
legislation and to reverse over 40 years of bureaucratic practices.
   The economic plan was announced in early October. It calls for
taking steps to change the principles of ownership, changing the
banking system and making state enterprises more efficient.
   It also envisages a social security system to protect workers
during the period of economic restructuring.

<HEAD>Expert Says Drugs in Motorcyclist's Blood Would Not Make Him Agressive</HEAD>

   Drugs found in the bloodstream of a black
motorcyclist shot to death by a policeman would not have caused him
to attack the officer, an expert for the prosecution testified.
   Dr. Herbert Moskowitz, an expert on drug-induced behavior, said
Monday that the high amounts of THC _ the active ingredient in
marijuana _ in the bloodstream of Clement Lloyd would have tended
to make him ``more mellow.''
   Moskowitz, of the University of California at Los Angeles, also
said that the small amounts of alcohol and cocaine that he had
ingested would not have significantly affected his driving or his
behavior.
   The defense for Colombian-born Officer William Lozano claims
Lloyd, 23, aimed his motorcycle at the officer while fleeing from a
squad car and that Lozano shot him in self-defense.
   The Jan. 16 shooting set off three days of riots.
   Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, died in the subsequent
crash and Lozano, 31, was charged with two counts of manslaughter.
   In earlier testimony Monday, associate medical examiner Arthur
Copeland said the levels of THC in Lloyd's bloodstream were among
the highest on record at the medical examiner's office.
   He also said Lloyd had a moderate amount of alcohol in his blood
and small traces of cocaine in his nose.
   Using the head of a mannequin, Copeland traced the path of
Lozano's bullet from the left front temple to the rear of the head,
saying it appeared the officer was to the side of the motorcycle
when the shot was fired.
   The prosecution contends that the motorcycle was not headed
directly at Lozano and that he fired unnecessarily.
   Copeland also testified that Lloyd was carrying 5.5 grams of
marijuana and $1,500 in cash at the time.
   The rioting that followed the shooting left one person dead from
gunfire, 11 people injured and 13 buildings burned down in black
neighborhoods.

   Medals and memorabilia belonging to Olympic hero
Harold Abrahams, whose story was told in the movie ``Chariots of
Fire,'' fetched $39,720 at auction today.
   Egyptian-born entrepreneur Mohamed Al-Fayed bought some 30 of
Abrahams' medals, stopwatches he used during training and his
Commander of the British Empire award bestowed by Queen Elizabeth
II in 1957, Christie's auctioneers said.
   The gold medal Abrahams won for the 100-meter race in the 1924
Paris Olympics was not among the items sold; it was stolen from his
home some 50 years after his victory.
   Abrahams' struggles to win Olympic gold were portrayed by Ben
Cross in the 1981 Oscar-winning movie. He was the first and only
Englishman to win the Olympic 100 meters, and gave up athletics
after a fall in a long jump competition in 1925. He died in 1978.
   ``I was inspired by a man who put principle before winning,''
said Al-Fayed, who with his two brothers owns Harrods department
store. The medals will go on display at Harrods before Christmas.
   Abrahams' adopted daughter, Susan Pottle, said she and her
brother, Patrick, decided to sell the collection because it was
languishing in a desk drawer.
   ``It seemed a pity to just leave them there,'' she said. ``We
wanted it to go to someone who will treasure it or to a museum.
   ``My father was only attached to his gold medal and wasn't that
worried what happened to the others. He had sold some of his silver
cups for scrap some years ago.''

<TEXT>
   Hepatitis B, a blood-borne disease that can
cause fatal liver cancer, is a much greater worldwide health threat
than AIDS, but U.S. doctors are doing little to promote use of a
vaccine against the illness, an infectious disease expert says.
   There are 20 to 30 times more carriers of the hepatitis B virus
than there are people infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS, Dr. Sanford F. Kuvin, vice
chairman of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said
Monday.
   ``Hepatitis B is the most important blood-borne disease in the
world today, and that includes AIDS,'' Kuvin said in an interview
at the fourth National Forum on AIDS and Hepatitis B. ``There are
almost 300 million carriers of the hepatitis B virus in the world
today and there are about 10 to 15 million carriers of the HIV
virus.''
   Among carriers of the hepatitis B virus, 25 percent, or about 60
million, will die from primary liver cancer, he said. An additional
15 percent, or about 45 million, will die of cirrhosis, another
liver disease.
   ``Hepatitis B is as great a threat to the health of Americans as
AIDS,'' Kuvin said. ``There are about 300,000 new infections of
hepatitis B annually in the United States.''
   About 30,000 of those newly infected will become carriers who
can spread the disease, and about one-fourth of this number
eventually will die of cirrhosis or liver cancer, he said.
   The exact number of Americans who die annually from primary
liver cancer caused by hepatitis B is not known because records on
liver cancer deaths do not reflect if the cancer originated in the
liver or moved there from another site.
   However, controlled studies have shown that one-fourth of all
hepatitis B virus carriers will develop primary liver cancer or
cirrhosis at some point in their lives.
   As of Sept. 30, there have been 109,167 reported cases of AIDS,
with 64,849 deaths, since June 1, 1981.
   In a keynote address to the conference, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan,
secretary of Health and Human Services, said, ``Americans need to
take hepatitis B as seriously as they do HIV infection.''
   Sullivan said that even though a vaccine is available to protect
against hepatitis B, the therapy is not widely used.
   ``Even health care workers, who should know better, have a
problem taking hepatitis B seriously,'' he said. ``A Centers for
Disease Control survey of hospitals with vaccination programs found
that only 36 percent of health care workers have received the
vaccination.''
   Sullivan said 10,000 to 12,000 health care workers contract
hepatitis B annually while caring for patients, and Kuvin said
about 300 of those infected health care workers die annually of
liver-related illnesses.
   ``A health care worker dies virtually every day because they
weren't inoculated against this disease,'' he said.
   Kuvin said that there are 26 known cases of health care workers
becoming infected with the AIDS virus on the job.
   Both the hepatitis B virus and the AIDS virus are spread through
contact with infected blood, through sexual intercourse and through
sharing of needles among intravenous drug users. Both viruses also
are spread from birthing mother to newborn.
   Kuvin said a health care worker who receives an accidental
needle prick while treating patients infected with hepatitis B has
a 40 percent chance of becoming infected. The threat of contracting
AIDS from a needle prick is only about 0.5 percent, he said.
   Most people infected with hepatitis B suffer mild symptoms and
then recover, but about 10 percent become carriers of the virus and
a fourth of these eventually will develop liver cancer or cirrhosis.
   Despite the known dangers of the disease, Kuvin said only 24
percent of all doctors have bothered to get the hepatitis B vaccine.
   ``It is absurd how underutilized this vaccine is,'' said Kuvin.
He said the vaccine, developed through gene manipulation techniques
and available since 1982, ``is the safest and most effective
vaccine in the world.''
   Hepatitis B is most common in Asia and Africa, and some
countries there now require routine inoculations against the
disease. The World Health Organization has recommended the
hepatitis B vaccine be part of routine childhood vaccination
programs, but Kuvin said no legislative body in the U.S. has
proposed such a program for Americans.
   ``This is the first time in American history that a vaccine has
been developed that did not produce a reduction in disease,'' said
the physician. ``This is a national tragedy in incubation.''

   NASA crews made up for lost time
today as they worked under a tight timetable for launching space
shuttle Discovery on a fiery nighttime flight Wednesday with five
astronauts and a spy satellite.
   ``They're making headway and expect to be caught up by tonight.
We're on schedule for Wednesday night,'' space agency spokeswoman
Lisa Malone reported today.
   Forecasters said the weather outlook was 80 percent favorable
but that an advancing cold front would drop the odds to 40 percent
if the launch were postponed to Thursday, Thanksgiving.
   Workers had fallen behind in checking out systems and putting
the two solid fuel booster rockets back together. They had been
opened last week so technicians could inspect computer boxes for
faulty wiring. One box was replaced.
   Because the mission is secret, NASA has said only that liftoff
is scheduled between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. and that the agency
will make the countdown public just nine minutes before liftoff.
The launch is expected to take place about 7:30 p.m.
   There also will be a news blackout throughout the mission.
   It will be only the third after-dark launch in 32 shuttle
missions. The last one, in November 1985, was visible for the 700
miles from Key West to Charleston, S.C.
   This is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the Defense
Department. Officials said the secrecy makes it more difficult for
Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off Cape Canaveral
to track the shuttle.
   The astronauts assigned to the mission slept during daylight
hours Monday to adjust their schedule to the hours they will keep
in space because of the nighttime launch. At night, the commander,
Air Force Col. Frederick C. Gregory, and the pilot Air Force Col.
John Blaha, practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in
a jet equipped to handle like a shuttle.
   Disovery is scheduled to land at night at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., after a flight expected to last four days. Gregory
and Blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here or
at emergency runways in Spain or North Africa in case of an abort
after liftoff.
   Gregory, who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission, is the first black
to command a shuttle mission.
   The other crew members are Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F.
Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton, all mission specialists.
   Their main job will be to deploy a satellite that sources who
demanded anonymity said will listen in on diplomatic and military
communications in the Soviet Union and other countries.

<HEAD>Chief Prosecutor Won't Appeal Palme Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief public prosecutor today said
he will not appeal the acquittal of a man in the slaying of Prime
Minister Olof Palme.
   The prosecutor, Torsten Jonsson, said it was unrealistic to
believe the Supreme Court would overturn the Nov. 2 decision of the
Svea Court of Appeals, the national news agency TT reported.
   Palme, a three-time socialist prime minister who dominated
Swedish politics for more than a decade, was shot Feb. 28, 1986
while walking home from a movie with his wife, Lisbeth.
   A district court in July convicted Christer Pettersson and
sentenced him to life imprisonment, largely based on Mrs. Palme's
identification.
   The appellate court later ruled that Mrs. Palme's testimony left
too much room for uncertainty.
   The appellate court, however, said that Pettersson had no alibi
and that he was most likely the man seen waiting for Palme outside
the movie theatre.
   Pettersson, 42, was previously convicted of several lesser
crimes, including manslaughter. He was confined for 10 months
during the interrogation and trial for the Palme slaying, and could
be arrested again in the case if new evidence is uncovered.

   Namibia's newly elected assembly broke
into applause today at its opening session when the dominant party
proposed democratic principles as guidelines for the territory's
government.
   The assembly is working on a constitution that will cement the
territory's independence after 74 years of South African rule.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, which
waged a 23-year war against South African rule, won 41 of the 72
seats in elections earlier this month. However, the constitution
must be approved by at least 48, or two-thirds, of the members.
   The 72 assembly members gathered at the Tintenpalast, Namibia's
seat of government since it was built by German colonial rulers in
1910.
   Theo-Ben Gurirab, foreign affairs secretary for SWAPO, proposed
that: the constitution be the supreme law of the land;, the
government consist of an elected executive responsible to the
legislative branch and an independent judicial branch; a
declaration of fundamental rights be written including freedom of
movement, speech and a free press.
   SWAPO has been known as Marxist throughout most of its history,
and its stand has been vague and contradictory regarding the
democratic principles outlined in a 1982 U.N. document calling for
Namibia's independence.
   Gurirab's proposal was unanimously applauded but could not be
adopted because the constitutional assembly does not yet have rules
of order. The assembly was adjourned until next week.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multi-racial coalition that
favors a capitalist economy for predominantly black Namibia, has 21
seats in the assembly. The remaining 10 are divided among five
other parties.
   ``I'm here with great humility and pride,'' SWAPO President Sam
Nujoma told the assembly. ``Pride, because an occasion like this
only happens once in a lifetime. Humility, because I, Sam Nujoma,
son of an ordinary citizen, have been honored to be part of the
struggle that brought us here and to lead us to nationhood.''
   Hage Geingob, who headed SWAPO's election campaign, was elected
chairman of the assembly.
   The initial sessions are expected to focus on setting ground
rules for writing the constitution. The parties have said they hope
the document will be completed by early next year and independence
from South Africa can be declared shortly afterward.
   Marrti Ahtisarri, head of the U.N. team monitoring the
transition to independence, was present at the opening of the
assembly. He has said he expects Namibia, also known as South-West
Africa, to become independent before the United Nations is
scheduled to depart at the end of March.
   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in 1915 and gained a
League of Nations mandate to administer the territory. The League's
successor, the United Nations, revoked the mandate in 1966, and
SWAPO launched its bush war.
   South Africa agreed last year to allow independence under a
U.S.-mediated peace accord that also calls for a phased withdrawal
of Cuba's 50,000 troops from Marxist-ruled Angola, Namibia's
northern neighbor.

<HEAD>Hakim to Plead Guilty in Iran-Contra Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: New throughout with additional detail of expected plea, Reagan
filing on subpoena; Hakim appears in court 2 p.m. EST; lead prospects uncertain</HEAD>

   Albert Hakim's lawyers have reached an
agreement with prosecutors that calls for the arms dealer to plead
guilty today to a misdemeanor for his role in the Iran-Contra
affair, sources said.
   Hakim, who helped broker the sale of U.S. arms to his native
Iran as part of then-President Reagan's efforts to free American
hostages in the Middle East, is scheduled to enter the plea in
federal court, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But the sources stressed that the deal was not final until Hakim
actually appeared in court and entered the plea before U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell. A previous court appearance was
abruptly canceled recently when Hakim backed out, the sources said.
   The exact terms of the plea agreement could not be obtained but
sources said Hakim had agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh, declined to comment.
   Lawyers for Reagan, meanwhile, filed court papers today
indicating they were studying the possibility of resisting a
subpoena for the former president to produce documents and testify
at the Iran-Contra trial of former national security adviser John
M. Poindexter.
   The subpoena ``raises novel and complex constitutional issues,''
the former president's lawyers said in seeking a two-week delay in
producing notes and papers sought by the subpoena.
   ``These issues relate to the scope of the executive privilege,
the power of the court to compel a former president to testify in
open court, and the threshold requirements necessary to support a
subpoena... against a former president,'' said Reagan's attorney,
Theodore Olson.
   In the Hakim case, it was expected that Walsh would drop major
charges of conspiracy, theft and wire fraud stemming from the arms
dealer's involvement in the diversion of weapons-sale profits to
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Those charges were dropped against Hakim's other co-defendants
after the government refused to release classified information
necessary for trying those counts in open court.
   Hakim also was charged with conspiracy and offering an illegal
gratuity to former White House aide Oliver L. North. The charges
stem from a $200,000 Swiss bank account that Hakim and his former
business partner, Richard V. Secord, allegedly set up for North's
family.
   North, a former National Security Council aide and retired
Marine officer, was ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community
service for his Iran-Contra convictions.
   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 9
to one count of lying to Congress during the televised hearings
about the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Justice Department also has asked for more time to comply
with subpoenas for Reagan documents in the National Archives and
Records Administration.
   The government's pleadings indicated misgivings about the
subpoenas seeking Reagan's papers and testimony at Poindexter's
Iran-Contra trial. Poindexter is accused of lying to Congress to
obstruct its inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Justice Department asked the court to delay until Dec. 6 the
deadline to comply with subpoenas for records at the archives. The
subpoenas are returnable on Wednesday.
   The department said it also sought a delay in the subpoena
personally served on the former president, noting that Reagan's
attorney would be filing a similar request.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said the archives
needed more time to review more than 100,000 pages of documents.
   The Justice Department also noted that ``depending upon their
nature, the United States may wish to assert that certain requested
documents must be protected from disclosure because of their
privileged nature.''
   ``However, even if some material is so privileged the United
States may choose to make a discretionary release in any event if
given time to consider the overall ramifications,'' the department
said.
   The department noted that following the review of the documents,
``both the United States and President Reagan must consider what if
any position each is required to take considering the fact and
scope of the live trial testimony sought of the former president.''

<TEXT>
   A man and woman were sent to prison for
bilking thousands of lonely men out of $4.5 million with phony
tales of a paradise inhabited by nude ``love angels.''
   The two leaders of the Church of Love carried out a
``cold-blooded'' scheme that ``made fools'' of their 31,000
victims, U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm said at sentencing Monday.
   Donald Lowry, 60, founder of the sex-fantasy scam, apologized
before receiving 27 years in prison. Pamala St. Charles, 26,
declared herself the scam's ``biggest victim'' before she was
sentenced to six years in prison.
   In addition, Lowry and Ms. St. Charles, both of Bettendorf,
Iowa, were each ordered to pay $94,500 in restitution and placed on
five years' probation.
   Prosecutors said Lowry and Ms. St. Charles used a mail-order
operation to sell phony stories and nude pictures of ``love
angels,'' whom the victims hoped to someday join at a paradise
called Chonda-Za. Victims were solicited for donations for the
clothes and upkeep of the ``angels,'' who were actually models.
   ``These men wanted to believe the promise of Chonda-Za,'' the
judge siad. ``Loneliness plays tricks on us all.''
   He labeled as ``pathetic'' the 50 Church of Love members who
attended the hearing in support of Lowry and St. Charles, who were
convicted in 1988 of conspiracy, mail fraud and money laundering.
   Lowry, a former teacher, started the Church of Love mail-order
operation in 1965. He used donations to the ``angels'' to pay
himself a huge salary, buy a fleet of expensive cars and obtain
sexual favors from some of the models.

<HEAD>Activist: Palestinians Have Lost Initiative in Uprising</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A pro-PLO activist says Palestinians have
``lost the initiative'' in the nearly two-year-old uprising and is
proposing a new strategy based on creating a provisional government.
   Sari Nusseibah said in an interview with The Associated Press on
Monday that if ``positive energy'' were focused on building the
institutions of Palestinian statehood, there would be less
violence, both among Palestinians and with Israelis.
   ``I believe over the last few months we have lost the initiative
and there has been a vacuum of strategy,'' he said. ``We haven't
had any renewed strategic plan to put into the intefadeh (uprising).
   ``In my opinion, these two things have helped in creating some
of the disorders ... the friction and fighting and some tendencies
towards violence.''
   By focusing on building infrastructure for the state, he said,
``you get rid of the diversions of energy that have taken place
over the past few months.''
   The remarks, unusually candid for a senior Palestinian
activists, in part appeared to grow out of rising frustration over
the killing or intimidation of Palestinians by other Palestinians.
   According to army figures released this week, Palestinian
activists have carried out 670 attacks this year against other
Palestinians, most accused of collaborating with Israel. By
Associated Press count, at least 147 Arabs have died in such
attacks.
   Some 615 Palestinians have died in confrontations with soldiers.
   Nusseibah said the problem stemmed largely from a lack of
overall coordination among local groups that had sprung up during
the intefadeh which he said led to confusion and unauthorized
initiatives.
   ``Our idea is to unite them in a single policy and seek to
implement it,'' he said.
   As a result, he said little headway in achieving statehood had
been made since the PLO met in Algeria in November 1988 and
declared an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A philosphy professor at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank,
Nusseibah has been described in Israeli court documents as closely
associated with the pro-PLO underground directing the uprising
against Israeli rule.
   His Holy Land Press Service was closed over the summer after
authorities said it was an intefadeh planning center, and he was
accused of acting as a conduit for PLO funds.
   He said that in the wake of last year's PLO declaration of an
independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied lands, ``we
should have moved, in my opinion, one step further in the direction
of state creation. We didn't do that.''
   Nusseibah said the PLO's 15-member executive committee, for
example, should be transformed into a Cabinet, parceling out
responsibilities such as health services, education and information.
   Palestinian officials in exile and those in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip would report to the same ``minister,'' thus
alleviating some of the confusion about lines of authority.
   He suggested Palestinians now serving in the Israeli-run
military government of the West Bank and Gaza could be named as
officials of a Palestinian government. Such officials have been
urged to resign by underground leaflets that have labeled them
collaborations.
   In the past, the concept of a provisional Palestinian government
has been proposed as a vehicle for negotiations, one that could get
around Israel's objections to talking to the PLO.
   Nusseibah said the PLO might ``wither away'' in its present form
if the infrastructure of a Palestinian state is created, allowing
the PLO to become part of the government.
   ``I think that people have come to realize here that a
Palestinian state is not going to arrive in a wrapped package ...
sent by the United Nations,'' he said. ``They have to create it.''

   Schoolchildren clasping their parents'
hands returned to class today for the first time since a tornado
killed seven classmates in the cafeteria.
   Flowers were piled high outside the cafeteria wall, but with a
stiff wind whipping the American flag on its flagpole nearby, few
people paused at the boarded-up wall at East Coldenham Elementary
School.
   Children riding school buses waved and smiled as they passed
reporters and police clustered at the end of the driveway to the
270-student school. Reporters were kept away from the school, and
school officials had no comment.
   Seven 7- and 8-year-olds were killed and 18 others injured last
Thursday when a tornado slammed into the cafeteria wall, raining
glass and concrete on students having lunch.
   Dozens of pupils visited the damaged cafeteria on Monday. Though
students and their parents were encouraged to look at the
cafeteria, they won't eat lunch there any time soon, Principal
Harvey Gregory said.
   The cafeteria carries the spray-painted epitaph: ``Pray for the
Children.''
   More than 20 counselors were on hand Monday and were to return
today.
   In some ways, the hardest task was reassuring parents, Gregory
said.
   ``Students are very resilient,'' Gregory said. ``They get back
very quickly. But parents _ dealing with the fears and traumas.
`How do I send my kid back into the cafeteria?' I can reassure
parents now that they will never go back into that cafeteria in its
present form.''
   Funerals were held Monday for five young victims and two were
held Saturday. Eleven of the 18 injured children remained
hospitalized, two in critical condition.
   Compounding the tragedy, a 5-year-old East Coldenham pupil,
Rosalie Sbordone, died Monday from injuries suffered in a car
accident the day before. The accident happened only a few hundred
yards from the school, but was unrelated to the steady stream of
mourners there, police said.
   At the school, Sheryl Pressel choked back sobs while leaving
with her 10-year-old son, Billy, who wasn't hurt.
   ``What amazes me are some of the parents of the children that
died are in there today,'' Pressel said. ``I don't think I could
handle that. If I had a child that I lost in that school, I
wouldn't want to go back in there.''
   Billy said he ``felt sort of regular'' coming back to the school
for the first time since the tornado.
   ``All I felt was a little sadness,'' he said. ``It helped me a
little.''
   Parents leaving the school stopped their cars to watch the
funeral procession for 8-year-old Maria Stumer pass.
   Rooms at the reopened school were set aside for adults and
children to slip off to if they become upset, said Horst Graefe,
director of personnel for the Valley Central School District.
   It will cost nearly $400,000 to rebuild the cafeteria wall, but
school Superintendent James Coonan said he wants to make it look as
different as possible, with less glass.
   ``We'll do anything to make it comfortable for the kids,'' he
said. ``If we have to make like booths in McDonald's, we will.''

<HEAD>Talks on Family Visits Deadlocked Over Revolutionary Opera</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Talks between South and North Korea on
an exchange of visits by separated family members hit a snag today
after the North insisted on showing a revolutionary opera by its
leader on South Korean television.
   Red Cross delegates from the two Koreas agreed to continue
discussions Monday on the proposed Dec. 8 family exchange, but the
chances of an agreement appeared slim.
   ``The prospect of the family exchange is dark as long as the
North Korean side sticks to its plan to show a revolutionary opera
encouraging class struggle,'' said South Korean senior delegate
Song Young-dae after eight hours of talks.
   North Korea's chief delegate, Pak Yong Su, urged Seoul to accept
the revolutionary opera, saying ``all the South Korean people want
to see it.''
   The opera is by North Korean President Kim Il Sung. It glorifies
him and his late mother, Kim Jung Suk.
   ``I don't think it would be impossible to reach an agreement,''
Pak told reporters when asked about prospects for the talks, which
reopened in September after a several-month stalemate.
   The delegates, meeting at this truce village inside the
demilitarized zone, overcame one problem today when they agreed on
the numbers: an exchange of 571-member delegations, for a period of
four days starting Dec. 8.
   They also agreed that each side would determine the composition
of its own delegation, which would be comprised of separated family
members, entertainers, support personnel and reporters.
   But the two sides could not agree on terms for their
entertainers to perform live on television.
   North Korea demanded four segments of air time, each lasting at
least three hours, during the four-day exchange. South Korea,
revising its original proposal, offered to allow three performances
of 2{ hours each.
   North Korean delegates insisted their entertainers needed at
least three hours to present the opera.
   South Korean officials denounced North Korea, saying it was
injecting political propaganda into the humanitarian project, and
strongly indicated that Seoul would not accept the showing of the
opera.
   There are about 10 million separated family members in the two
Koreas, which were divided by the partition of the Korean peninsula
in 1945 and the Korean War in 1950-53.
   The Red Cross talks are one of several channels of dialogue
under way to help ease tension on the peninsula. Talks on sports,
political and parliamentary contacts also have made little progress.

   Readers from all over the country have been
ringing a State Police station because the number is listed in one
of horror writer Stephen King's books.
   King has offered his apologies, but police say no harm done.
   The author says he didn't realize the consequences when he
decided to use the real number in ``Dark Half.''
   ``When I came to that part in the book, I thought, `Well, I'm
using the Maine State Police in Orono, I'll use the right number.'
I got out the phone book and there it was in bold type,'' said
King, who lives in Bangor.
   Communications supervisor Jim Ryan said the calls made to Orono
are no problem because they have been coming in on a non-emergency
line.
   ``All are very nice people who are just curious to see if the
number is for real,'' said dispatcher Dan Lawrence. ``A lady from
Montana said she is coming to Maine next year for vacation and
wants to stop by the barracks to get my autograph.''

<HEAD>Government Seeks to Force Firms to Disclose Cash-Paying Clients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has gone to court in an
unprecedented attempt to force two criminal-law firms to disclose
the names of clients who paid them in cash.
   The action filed in federal court Friday was the first attempt
to enforce Internal Revenue Service demands for the information
from lawyers nationwide.
   A 1984 federal law aimed at money laundering requires reporting
of cash transactions of $10,000 or more.
   The Justice Department announced the legal action Monday.
   Both law firms involved in the case _ Fischetti Pomerantz &amp;
Russo and Goldberger &amp; Dubin _ have represented alleged mob figures
and drug suspects.
   They have refused to turn over the information, saying that it
would violate the rights of their clients and the attorney-client
privilege.
   Calls to the two firms were not returned today.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kay K. Gardiner said the government was
merely enforcing the law.
   ``The law is that information regarding fees and the identity of
clients is not privileged,'' she said.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack ordered the firms to appear
in court Dec. 19 to explain why they should not be forced to
provide the information. If they fail to comply, they could face
criminal penalties including prison terms and fines of as much as
$500,000.
   The action is only the latest battle between the IRS and defense
lawyers.
   Prosecutors in New York and Washington have sought to force
lawyers to forfeit fees paid by defendants whose money allegedly
came from crime. The Supreme Court approved the prosecutors'
forfeiture claims earlier this year.

   Television cameras focused on the House of Commons
today to give Britons their first live screen view of the
venerable, if sometimes raucous mother of parliaments.
   The first image they saw in the live broadcast was the gowned,
bewigged speaker, Bernard Weatherill, bellowing ``Order! Order!''
to bring chattering, excited lawmakers into line for the TV debut
of the Mother of Parliaments.
   The unelected House of Lords has permitted television broadcasts
of its proceedings since 1985, and Queen Elizabeth II's ceremonial
opening of Parliament was seen nationwide earlier this morning.
   But the House of Commons, the often rowdy elected chamber down
the hallway, resisted the cameras until now, sticking only with
live radio broadcasts that began in 1978.
   Former Conservative Cabinet minister Ian Gow delivered the
traditional message of thanks to the queen for outlining the
government's legislative program earlier today in the House of
Lords.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, leader of the governing
Conservative Party, and Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition
Laborites, then prepared to joust with each other about the
contents of the queen's speech.
   Any other lawmaker could join in, providing he or she can catch
the Speaker's eye by standing up and waving an order paper _ a
printed copy of the day's agenda _ and be called.
   The chamber can be a noisy place with much booing and braying
and it's Weatherill who can be heard repeatedly shouting ``Order,
order'' in a bid to restore calm at times of tension.
   But TV viewers are not going to see it all.
   To prevent anything unseemly being shown, such as campaign
buttons, outrageous dress or bored legislators asleep on their
green leather benches, the televisors have been ordered to show
only the head and shoulders of whoever is speaking.
   ``I think it's terrible that head shots will only be used. I
could be wearing a tutu, and nobody would notice,'' said Laborite
Austin Mitchell.
   Debates in the 650-member chamber go on for hours and hours,
sometimes all night. Eight remote control cameras have been
installed in the ornate chamber. Britain's four national channels
and the Sky satellite network will be able to broadcast as much as
they like of the daily proceedings, live or recorded.
   C-SPAN, the American cable-satellite public affairs network,
planned to offer portions of the debates to its subscribers.
   It has taken 30 years of debate to get cameras into the Commons.
   A 318-264 vote in February 1988 agreed to them for an
experimental six months, although the House of Lords _ where the
peers, most of them hereditary, sit on scarlet benches _ have been
on live TV since 1985.
   The U.S. House of Representatives has allowed television since
1979.
   The 21-month delay in getting the cameras into the Commons
included the dispatch of a delegation to Canada to see how
Parliament is televised there.
   ``Planning the invasion of Normandy in World War II took only 12
months,'' grumbled lawmaker Frank Dobson.
   It has taken 30 years of debate to get cameras into the Commons.
   A 318-264 vote in February 1988 allowed them for a six-month

Parliament is televised there.
   ``Planning the invasion of Normandy in World War II took only 12
months,'' grumbled lawmaker Frank Dobson.
   The partisan shouts and jeers of the Commons have made it a
byword for unruly behavior. This week's comments in the media
centered on whether the cameras will make the chamber better
behaved _ or possibly worse.
   London's Evening Standard newspaper predicted Monday that the
Commons was unlikely to beat the soap operas as a favorite with the
public.
   ``But, at least, we may get an insight into why they make those
peculiar noises we have heard for so long on the Commons sound
broadcasts,'' it said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today expressed
support for the rapid changes encompassing Eastern Europe,
including current demands for reform in Czechoslovakia.
   Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union must undergo radical change
because they lag behind the West technologically, Gorbachev told
reporters after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   On Monday, about 200,000 people filled Prague's streets
demanding free elections and other freedoms, and tens of thousands
demonstrated again today. Also, an official newspaper published an
opposition call for the ouster of top Communist leaders.
   ``I think the changes underway now are consistent with the
overall context of the changing world, a world that is changing
both in the East and the West,'' Gorbachev told reporters.
   ``I think the change is very important, and the importance of
the change will be that it will create a better society, a more
open society, a more democratic society,'' he said.
   Mulroney, the first Canadian prime minister to make an official
visit to Moscow since 1971, invited Gorbachev to visit Canada and
address the Canadian parliament, a Canadian press pool report said.
No date for the proposed visit was given.

   The Nicaraguan government, seeking a
cease-fire agreement, today dropped its demand for a total
withdrawal of Contra rebels from Nicaraguan territory and called
instead for a pull-back of 2,300 insurgents.
   Outlining the new proposal at a news conference, Nicaraguan Vice
Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said the figure represents the
total number of Contras who have infiltrated into Nicaragua from
base camps in Honduras in recent weeks.
   ``If the Contras do not accept the proposal, they have no
interest in a cease-fire,'' Tinoco said.
   He spoke to reporters at the Nicaraguan Embassy shortly before
the resumption of cease-fire talks with the Contras at the
Organization of American States.
   The Contras have insisted on a cease-fire in place and have said
that there has been no significant increase in the number of rebels
operating inside Nicaraguan territory in recent weeks.
   But Tinoco said even the State Department has acknowledged that
about 2,000 Contras have crossed back across the border from the
Honduran base camps since the first week of October.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega suspended the cease-fire on
Nov. 1 after alleging the Contra forces had engaged in terrorist
activities.
   The chief Contra negotiator, Col. Enrique Bermudez, has accused
the Sandinistas of hardening their position by insisting on both
the withdrawal of the Contras and their demobilization. But Tinoco
has said Bermudez misunderstood the Sandinista position.
   A commission made of United Nations and Organization of American
States mediators spent the weekend drawing up revisions of a plan
they had set forth during the early going of the negotiations,
which began Nov. 9.
   Part of Monday's negotiating session was spent going over the
revisions.
   Before the talks resumed Monday, rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros
accused the Sandinistas of not negotiating in good faith.
   ``They want a total surrender,'' he said. ``They want an
unconditional surrender.''
   Matamoros called for an immediate cease-fire with appropriate
verification procedures.
   Tinoco reaffirmed his government's view that the cease-fire must
be linked to a ``separation of forces'' _ meaning the withdrawal of
Contra forces to base camps in Honduras.
   ``That's fundamental,'' Tinoco said.
   Tinoco also disclosed he had a brief meeting with a State
Department official Saturday to discuss issues relating to the
staffing of the respective embassies of the two countries.
   He didn't identify the official with whom he spoke.
   The administration generally has avoided high-level contact with
the Sandinistas, urging them instead to focus attention on
resolving their differences with both the Contras and the internal
opposition.

   A train dubbed the ``poo poo choo-choo'' for
its cargo of sewage sludge is back from the South after failing to
find a place to unload.
   The city of Baltimore had contracted with GSX Chemical Services
of Columbia, S.C., to dispose of the cargo at a White Castle, La.,
waste treatment plant.
   However, officials in Louisiana said the waste was so smelly
that they would not allow it to be unloaded. Mississippi wouldn't
accept the cargo, either.
   GSX returned the 5,000 tons of sludge to Baltimore, where the
train is parked at a railyard while public works officials figure
out what to do next.

   Delegates to a Communist Party
congress today extolled hard-line leader Nicolae Ceausescu and
offered lavish praise for his rejection of democratic reform.
   Politburo member and labor leader Miu Dobrescu said Ceausescu's
nearly six-hour speech to delegates Monday was ``an exemplary model
of creative tackling of present-day realities, a genuine thesaurus
of social and political thinking.''
   Ceausescu, the East bloc's fiercest hard-line leader, opened the
party congress with a firm rejection of reforms sweeping the
region. Instead, he declared his intention to increase government
and party control of daily affairs.
   ``The ruling out of the capitalist system ... is the leading
requirement of a just society,'' Ceausescu asserted to orchestrated
displays of adulation from more than 3,000 delegates at downtown
Palace Hall in Bucharest.
   He also called for the cancellation of the Hitler-Stalin pact of
1939, under which Germany and the Soviet Union later annexed parts
of Eastern Europe. The Romanian province of Bessarabia was annexed
by Moscow a year later under the pact's secret protocol. It was the
first time Ceausescu had mentioned the accord.
   ``A clear, unequivocal stand of condemnation and cancellation
must be taken against all the accords concluded with Hitler's
Germany, practical conclusions being drawn to eliminate all the
consequences of those accords and dictates,`` he said in his speech.
   Romanian Communist leaders never reclaimed the province, now
called Soviet Moldavia. However, the party daily, Scinteia, for the
first time published a story Nov. 14 describing recent popular
unrest in Kishinev, the republic's capital.
   The delegates' support underscored Ceausescu's tight control of
the congress and the personality cult that has grown up around him
during his 24 years in power.
   His comments were interrupted for up to 50 seconds by shouts of
``Romania, Communism! Ceausescu, Heroism!'' and other slogans
shouted in unison to the accompaniment of rhythmic clapping.
   The five-day congress is expected to approve Ceausescu's
economic plan for the next five years.
   The plan continues strong state control of the economy.
Ceausescu has invested billions of dollars in a crash
industrialization program that led to widespread food and energy
shortages for Romania's 23 million people.
   Yet the longer the food lines and the more vocal the people's
complaints, the more harshly the regime has cracked down on critics.
   During the congress, Ceausescu as well as relatives and
supporters were expected to win re-election to the party leadership.
   Although a nominal ally, Hungary for the first time sent no
party delegation to the congress amid tensions over Hungary's rapid
moves toward democracy and its accusations that Romania mistreats
its Hungarian minority.
   Also absent were all sixteen NATO countries except Turkey. In
the past, Western ambassadors have attended the opening day of the
congress.
   A U.S. statement expressed the ``depths of U.S. concern over the
human rights situation, for which the Romanian Communist Party is
responsible.''
   Other embassies also said they were protesting human rights
violations.
   Romania has been targeted internationally for Draconian
restrictions on its citizens. Romanians are forced to report
contacts with foreigners, and they have severely limited political
and religious freedoms.

<HEAD>Psychologists Who Talked about Mrs. Dukakis May Face Censure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four psychologists who speculated publicly about
the reasons Kitty Dukakis became depressed and drank rubbing
alcohol may face censure or have their licenses revoked by a state
board, a newspaper reported today.
   The Board of Registration of Psychologists, appointed by Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis, says the psychologists may have violated
ethical principles in commenting on Mrs. Dukakis' condition in The
Boston Globe, the newspaper said.
   The Nov. 10 article suggested that the governor's wife broke
down in part because she was carrying all the emotional burdens of
the Dukakis marriage.
   If a complaint is filed as a result of a preliminary inquiry,
which is under way, the psychologists could be censured or lose
their licenses. The psychologists are Esther Shapiro, Caroline
Maltas, Barry Dym and David Kantor.
   The inquiry raises questions about professional ethics as well
as free speech, said Floyd Abrams, a lawyer specializing in First
Amendment cases.
   He said the board's actions give the appearance the state is
trying to quash speculation about the governor's wife.
   ``In a situation like this, where the governor and his family
are under intense public scrutiny, it's particularly important that
state agencies not become involved in making any threats to those
who have been a part of the process,'' Abrams said.
   Andrew Dreyfus, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Consumer
Affairs, which oversees the state's independent licensing boards,
said the order initiating the inquiry did not come from the
governor.
   Herbert J. Hoffman, a board member, said the inquiry was
prompted by the Globe article, which appeared on the same day as a
board meeting. After a ``full and lengthy discussion, there was a
consensus'' to contact the psychologists about their comments, he
said.
   He added it is the board's duty to make sure psychologists
conduct themselves in a ``professionally responsible'' manner when
commenting to the media.
   In letters to the psychologists, the board suggested they may
have violated at least six of the board's ethical principles.
   Three of the four psychologists said they believed they were
misquoted, misrepresented or quoted out of context in the Nov. 10
article but would not comment beyond that statement, The Globe
said. Shapiro confirmed that she received a letter from the board
but would not say whether she was quoted accurately.
   Thomas Mulvoy, managing editor of The Globe, said the newspaper
stands by the article He also defended the practice of reporters
asking experts about current events even though they are not
directly involved.
   ``We report by analogy all the time,'' he said. ``If a major
political figure has heart bypass surgery ... certainly a
reasonable approach is to go to doctors and ask how the procedure
works.''

   A former airline pilot was convicted today
of murdering his wife and running the body through a wood chipper
to get rid of the evidence.
   A Superior Court jury deliberated more than three days before
finding Richard Crafts guilty in the 1986 slaying. The 51-year-old
Newtown man could receive up to 60 years in prison at sentencing
Jan. 8.
   Crafts was accused of killing his Danish-born wife, Helle, in
their bedroom, cutting up the body with a chainsaw and feeding
parts through a rented wood chipping machine.
   Prosecutors were unable to establish the cause of death but said
blood was spattered on the bedroom walls.
   Because Mrs. Crafts' body was never found, the prosecution faced
a burden of proof unprecedented in Connecticut _ proving that a
woman had been murdered when the defense argued that she may still
be alive, perhaps living in Europe.
   The evidence included less than an ounce of human remains, such
as a fingernail and hair that the prosecution claimed were Mrs.
Crafts.'
   Witnesses included three Newtown-area residents who said they
saw a man using a wood chipper on a bridge above the Housatonic
River.
   Damaging testimony also came from Crafts' brother-in-law, David
Rodgers, who said Crafts told him police divers would not find his
wife's remains in the river.
   According to Rodgers, Crafts said, ``Let them dive. There's no
body _ it's gone.''
   The prosecution suggested Crafts acted out of anger that his
wife, a 39-year-old flight attendant and mother of three, had asked
for a divorce because her husband was seeing another woman.
   Crafts' first trial in 1988 ended in a mistrial when a juror
walked out of deliberations after refusing to join in a guilty
verdict.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150,000 protesters
filled central Prague today in the fifth day of anti-government
demonstrations, and the Communist premier told opposition leaders
he favors reforms.
   The state news agency said prosecutors have begun investigating
police brutality at an anti-government rally on Friday in which
hundreds of peaceful demonstrators were clubbed.
   And in Moscow, Mikhail S. Gorbachev backed the rapid changes
encompassing Eastern Europe, including the demands for reform in
Czechoslovakia. ``I think the changes under way now are consistent
with the overall context of the changing world,'' he said.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec said for the first time that Communist
authorities were open to a dialogue with the opposition.
   He told a delegation including opposition members that the
hard-line leadership was willing to hold a dialogue and did not
rule out talking with members of Charter 77, Eastern Europe's
oldest human rights organization. The premier also said he favored
having non-Communists in government.
   The premier met with a 10-member delegation that included
members of the newly formed Civic Forum opposition movement as well
as representatives of the Communist Party youth movement, the CTK
state new agency reported.
   Members of the delegation quoted Adamec as saying, ``the
situation in the (state-controlled) mass media is intolerable,''
and that he was in favor of a ``different concept of the leading
role of the party.''
   They also quoted him as saying he favored ``having in the
federal government people with no membership in a political party
and members of other political parties and especially young
people.''
   A government spokesman, Marcel Jansen, denied earlier reports
that the group included Vaclav Havel, a playwright and
Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident. There were no immediate
details on the talks.
   Civic Forum, formed Sunday, is comprised of a dozen opposition
groups. It has demanded the resignation of officials who carried
out purges following the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in
1968 and those who ordered security forces to use violence to crush
Friday's demonstrations.
   A Communist-allied Czechoslovak newspaper, Lidova Demokrace,
published an opposition call for the ouster of top Communists, a
demand of the estimated 200,000 people who marched through Prague
on Monday with chants of ``Freedom!''
   On Monday, the country's major state media also broke with past
practice by providing extensive coverage of the march in the
capital _ Communist Czechoslovakia's largest anti-government
demonstration ever.
   The coverage indicated the party leadership was increasingly
shifting to the East German approach of tolerating massive public
protests.
   CTK announced that the general prosecutor of the Czech republic
had opened an investigation into the actions of security forces
Friday. Scores of demonstrators were beaten by riot police to break
up an anti-government rally.
   Early today, posters condemning police brutality appeared on
shop windows, office buildings and restaurants. The official CTK
news agency said about 200 to 300 young people held an all-night
vigil in downtown Wenceslas Square, where Monday's demonstration
began.
   The pro-democracy tide now sweeping over one of the East bloc's
last strongholds of hard-line communism also spread Monday to
provincial cities, which saw their first big street demonstrations
in decades.
   So far, however, there has been no indication that workers have
heeded student calls to join the strike.
   Protesters waved ``V'' for victory signs in Prague, where a
government-sponsored reform movement was crushed by a Soviet-led
invasin 21 years ago. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is now
encouraging East bloc allies to embrace popular demand for reforms.
   Student strike committee leaders said demonstrations would
continue daily at least through this week.
   The announcement may have played a role in the sudden
cancellation of a scheduled visit that was to have begun today by
new East German leader Egon Krenz, who is under mounting popular
pressure to resign.
   The newspaper of the Communist-allied Christian Democratic
Party, Lidova Demokrace, published a statement today from the Civic
Forum opposition group that called for the resignation of Jakes and
other top party officials.
   The move appeared to indicate that some partners in the
Communist-dominated coalition are starting to distance themselves
from their ruling allies.
   In Washington, the State Department canceled a planned visit by
Jan Fojtik, chief ideologist of the Czechoslovak Communist Party,
because of the use of force against protesters.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc:
   In Bucharest, Romania, delegates to a Communist Party congress
today extolled hard-line leader Nicolae Ceausescu and offered
lavish praise for his rejection of democratic reform. Ceausescu,
the East bloc's fiercest hard-line leader, condemned reforms taking
place in neighboring nations Monday.
   In East Germany, a state-run newspaper sharply criticized party
chief Krenz today, saying he has not won popular trust. Also, a
West German newspaper, Bild, said Krenz could be ousted as the
nation's senior leader within four weeks. Krenz himself
acknowledged in a nationally televised interview Sunday he could
lose his power during a party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17.

   A friend of Larry Mahoney, the driver
blamed for the nation's deadliest alcohol-related accident,
testified today he took away Mahoney's keys because he had been
drinking too much the night of the crash.
   Taylor Fox said he saw Mahoney twice that night and that they
had discussed driving to Burlington, a Cincinnati suburb.
   ``I thought he's been drinking and he doesn't have no business
being on the road,'' Fox said. ``I planned to take him to
Burlington, anyway, so I just took the keys.''
   Mahoney, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder in the crash
the night of May 14, 1988. His pickup truck was traveling the wrong
way on an interstate near Carrollton when it slammed into a bus,
which exploded in flames.
   Mahoney's lawyers have contended that Fox never took Mahoney's
keys. They have said that ``so-called friends'' of Mahoney gave him
beer and liquor that night, although he was known to have a low
tolerance for alcohol.
   Fox conceded under cross-examination that Mahoney was not
staggering or slurring his words and did not otherwise appear to be
intoxicated. Fox also had trouble recalling exactly when he took
Mahoney's keys.
   The first prosecution witnesses testified Monday that Mahoney
was drinking the afternoon and evening of the crash _ the nation's
second-deadliest school bus crash and the worst involving alleged
drunken driving.
   Two bartenders, a liquor store clerk and two of Mahoney's
friends testified that he drank at least five beers, but all said
he didn't appear drunk.
   Mahoney's lawyers maintained in opening arguments Monday that he
wasn't solely responsible for the deaths of the 24 youngsters and
three adults. They argued that unsafe design made the 1977 former
school bus a death trap.
   It was a ``horrible tragedy, a senseless tragedy, one that
didn't need to happen,'' said defense attorney Russell Baldani.
``The truth will lead you to a very simple conclusion: Larry
Mahoney is not a murderer.''
   The bus was taking 67 people home from an amusement park near
Cincinnati. Most were members of a youth group at the First
Assembly of God church in Radcliff.
   ``Plain and simple, this is a murder case,'' Special Prosecutor
Paul Richwalsky told the jury. ``It's about who was involved and
who was responsible. It's about the terrible cost of drunken
driving.''
   Jurors Monday were taken to the crash scene and to the warehouse
where the wreckage of the bus and Mahoney's Toyota pickup are being
held as evidence.
   The courtroom was packed with relatives of the dead, many of
whom were from military families. Some were outraged at the defense
contention that Mahoney doesn't bear responsibility for the deaths,
and they equated drinking and driving with premeditated murder.
   One was Army 1st Sgt. Lee Williams, whose wife and two daughters
were killed.
   ``What's the difference if you murder somebody with an AK-47, a
bomb or a steering wheel?'' Williams asked. ``It's obvious that he
drove the vehicle, ... that he hit the bus, and there's 27 cemetery
plots out there with 27 people in them.''
   Mickie Muller, whose 13-year-old daughter, Katrina, survived
with burns, agreed: ``This was not an accident. This was a man who
chose to drink, who chose to get in a car.''
   Defense attorneys said Mahoney will accept responsibility for
the crash but not the deaths.
   They have contended that the bus, which was sold as school
surplus, was a latent bomb because of a vulnerable fuel tank. They
said the bus also lacked enough exits and that its 12-inch-wide
aisle was too narrow for emergency escapes.
   The deaths were caused by smoke inhalation, authorities said.
   The prosecutor said he would prove Mahoney exhibited ``extreme
indifference to the value of a human life'' when, driving north on
I-71, he crossed the median and entered the southbound lanes.
   Mahoney continued on for 2.3 miles, ignoring motorists' attempts
to signal him, until plowing into the bus, Richwalsky said.
   In addition to the murder counts, Mahoney is charged with 42
counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and one count
of drunken driving.

prison in Florida, where he served nearly 16 months of a five-year

back his law license, which was indefinitely suspended by the
Mississippi Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German
foreign minister, today brought President Bush a piece of the
Berlin Wall as well as the thanks of the German people for helping
to bring the barrier down.
   ``I will treasure this,'' Bush told Genscher as they posed for
photographers at the outset of an Oval Office meeting.
   Genscher replied: ``It is an expression of the strength of
freedom and democracy all over Germany that our Germans ... were in
a position, by peaceful means'' to open the wall.
   He said ``the German Democratic Republic (East Germany's formal
name) is on the way really to become a democratic republic,''
although he added that this depends on free elections in the
communist state in the year ahead.
   Genscher expressed ``our great gratitude for the support, the
help and the firmness of the American nations in the past decades.''
   ``It's the result of a very clear policy of the West advocating
freedom and democracy all over the Europe,'' he said as Bush
admired the nearly foot-long gray brick that the minister had given
him.
   ``We will do nothing to undermine this process or even to weaken
this process'' of reform throughout Eastern Europe, said Genscher.
``We do not look for advantage ... when they have to face
difficulty.''
   Genscher, asked about modernizing nuclear forces in West
Germany, said, ``I think this is a time to be discussed in '92 as
was agreed in the NATO communique.''
   Genscher had been pressing for talks to reduce short-range
nuclear arms last spring before the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization rallied behind Bush's arms proposals.
   The West Germany official told reporters after the meeting that
he was impressed with the ``complete agreement'' he shared with
Bush and his advisers on how to approach Eastern Europe at this
``really historic moment'' of developing democracies.
   Genscher said it was important that the Soviet Union and East
European countries understand that the Western allies ``will do all
we can to guarantee this stability'' and will do nothing from the
outside to disturb the move to freer societies.
   The meeting with the West German minister came as Bush prepares
for next week's shipboard summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev off Malta.
   The president will meet with another ally, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, at Camp David, Md., on Friday.
   Bush won loud applause from audiences in Rhode Island on Monday
when he promised to ``keep my eyes wide open'' and approach the
talks with caution.
   ``I sometimes get needled a little about being cautious and
prudent, but somehow I think that's what a president of the United
States ought to do when you go to meet ... a Soviet leader,'' Bush
said.
   Speaking today to the National Association of State Universities
and Land-Grant Colleges, Bush urged college presidents to ``take a
stand'' and tell their students ``that society will not tolerate
the use of drugs.''
   He appealed for help in drafting new national goals for
education, and also urged the administrators to take to heart an
admonition from Princeton University President Harold Shapiro that
colleges must ``be much more selective about what we do'' to keep
the costs of higher education within reasonable bounds.
   Bush spent Monday in Chicago and Providence to boost the
fortunes of two pro-choice Republican congresswomen, Reps. Lynn
Martin and Claudine Schneider, who have their eyes on Senate races
next year.
   But immediately after singing Schneider's praises in Providence,
he got aboard Air Force One and for a second time vetoed a District
of Columbia appropriations bill because of abortion funding
provisions he found ``unacceptable.''
   Schneider, who has not yet declared her candidacy for the seat
now occupied by Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell, was a guest on the
presidential aircraft and she told reporters, ``I'm disappointed.''
   Schneider, Martin and two other pro-choice GOP congresswomen met
with Bush last Tuesday to, in Schneider's words, ask him to make
clear there was room within the GOP for abortion rights supporters.
   Schneider said they asked him ``to find a way where he could
still maintain the integrity of his own position on abortion
without becoming involved in the minutiae of legislation, making
determinations of who does what with the money when.''
   ``Clearly he has sent that message by coming up to Rhode Island
on my behalf today,'' she said.
   But his second D.C. appropriations veto _ his fourth
abortion-related veto in recent weeks _ indicated that Bush is
adamantly opposed to any public funding for abortion, except to
save the life of the mother.
   The District bill would have used federal Medicaid funds for
abortions only in those circumstances, but would have allowed the
district to pay for abortions on demand for poor women with local
taxpayers' dollars.
   But under the district's home rule law, even its locally
generated tax dollars are subject to approval by Congress and the
president, and Bush said he wanted no part of funding abortions
``with no restriction whatsoever.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said House Speaker Thomas
Foley had requested quick presidential action ``so Congress could
have time to act on it before the Thanksgiving recess.''
   Fitzwater announced earlier that Bush will stay over in Europe
an extra day after the Dec. 2-3 meeting with Gorbachev to brief the
NATO allies in Brussels.
   At a fund-raising reception for Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete
in a tent outside his Cranston, R.I., mansion, Bush predicted,
``It's going to be a historic meeting,'' but quickly added, ``I
don't want to see overpromises coming from it.''
   But he said, ``We are living in times where the potential for
peace and reduced tensions has never been better.''

   A land mine exploded in southwestern
Sudan, killing three policemen and injuring several others, the
Sudan News Agency said Tuesday.
   The police were accompanying a supply convoy from Kadugli to
Saififa on Sunday when the explosion occurred, the state-run news
agency said.
   The police had been sent to the area, about 375 miles southwest
of Khartoum, to prevent more tribal clashes that killed 68 people
last month.
   The agency did not say who planted the mine, but southern rebels
belonging to the Sudan People's Liberation Army are known to have
extended their activities into southwestern Sudan.

<TEXT>
   The new Communist Party chief criticized his
predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, for siding with rioters during the
pro-democracy protests and said ``international hostile forces''
will continue to try to thwart socialism.
   In remarks released Tuesday, Jiang Zemin also praised senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, who recently retired from his last party
post, and indicated Deng still plays a pivotal role in government.
   He also called for cooperation to strengthen the national
economy and criticized corruption and a lack of discipline in the
party.
   Jiang made his comments in a wide-ranging speech to the
Communist Party's Central Committee Nov. 9. The speech was carried
by the official Xinhua News Agency and read on television. Neither
gave a reason for the delay in reporting the speech.
   ``The struggle between international hostile forces and
socialist countries will exist for a long time on the levels of
infiltration and counterinfiltration, subversion and
countersubversion,'' Jiang said.
   He was referring to the Chinese army's bloody suppression in
June of the pro-democracy movement, which the government calls
``counterrevolutionary turmoil'' and says was supported from
overseas.
   ``Because of a rampant ideological trend favoring bourgeois
liberalization (western ideals) for a period in the recent past,
there was confusion about many theoretical issues,'' Jiang said.
   ``Some cadres, including some leading officials, were affected
by this to different degrees, and some even sided with the
rioters,'' he said.
   He was clearly alluding to ousted party chief Zhao, who was
dropped from all his party posts in June for supporting the
student-led demonstrators and is believed to be under house arrest.
   Zhao's removal led to Jiang's meteoric rise from Shanghai party
boss to head the party at the last Central Committee plenum in June.
   Earlier this month, he was named to head the powerful Central
Military Commission as Deng's handpicked successor. Deng, 85,
retired as head of the commission, his last party post.
   Jiang, 62, urged patience in awaiting results from the ambitious
market-oriented reforms started by Deng a decade ago.
   While Deng's reforms have raised the standard of living for
millions of Chinese, increased production, and made more goods,
many of them imported, available to consumers, a common complaint
is that the reforms have not been benefited more people.
   But Jiang gave high praise to Deng, who despite his retirement
remains the most powerful man in China.
   While the Central Committee initially opposed Deng's desire to
step down,``a consensus of views is reached that Comrade Xiaoping
is far-sighted, so we should respect his wishes and grant his
request,'' Jiang said.
   ``The health and longevity of Comrade Xiaoping are of great
significance to the smooth development of the work of the party and
the state.''
   Jiang mentioned democracy, but not in the context of political
reforms. Party members and leaders, he said,``must adhere to the
principle of democracy, develop a democratic style of work, give
heed to opinions from all walks of life, including different and
even dissenting opinions.''
   He also displayed an almost disarming modesty, saying he was not
prepared to take the helm of the 47 million-member party in June.
   He lashed out at the bribery, embezzlement and other corruption
that has become widespread, saying,``We must rely on the masses to
strengthen our efforts to construct clean politics, and fight
against corruption and unhealthy tendencies in society and our
party.''
   He also said party discipline had become lax,
encouraging``selfish departmentalism and overstress on local
interest.''
   Party organizations in rural areas, he said,``are in a state of
weakness and slackness ... paralyzed or semi-paralyzed.''

   Lev. N. Zaikov, the hard-line Communist who

removed today from that powerful position, a party official said.
Zaikov had been promoted.
   Zaikov, 66, ``was relieved of his responsibilities as Communist
Party first secretary for Moscow'' by a plenary meeting of the
Moscow party committee, said a duty officer at Moscow party
headquarters.
   Zaikov's removal is connected ``to his transfer to a higher

   Zaikov, who is also a member of the ruling Politburo, was named
party boss in the Soviet capital after Yeltsin was fired in
disgrace in November 1987 for criticizing the slow pace of Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reform program.

   A publisher says it has agreed to correct
a textbook that depicts the coyote as no threat to sheep.
   Holt, Rinehart and Winston Inc., at the behest of the state
Textbook Commission, will provide an amended page for Utah users of
the book.
   The high school English text, in an exercise on identifying
nouns, says the ``most widespread misperception about coyotes is
that they prey on cattle and sheep'' and that no scientist has
documented a case of coyotes killing cattle or sheep.
   Clair R. Acord, executive secretary of the Utah Woolgrowers,
said 1988 figures from state and federal officials show that 24,300
sheep valued at $2.1 million were reported killed by coyotes in
Utah, which has roughly 500,000 sheep.
   Rural pupils likely wouldn't be taken in by the textbook, but
``an urban child could get the idea that the coyote is a prince,
which he isn't,'' Acord said.
   Pat McCambridge, a senior editor for Holt, Rinehart in Austin,
Texas, said, ``We had no reason to believe our source was wrong and
had no idea that this was controversial.''
   She said the amended page will say coyotes are known to kill
domestic animals and can have a devastating effect on sheep herds.

   The shootings stemmed from several fights that broke out during

   The Podsadowskis treated the Dalleys to dinner Friday at a

   ``It's hard to express how moving it was,'' Mrs. Dalley said.
``The next day, I cried all day.''

   A millionaire's widow was sentenced to life in
prison today for hiring three men to kill her husband for $100,000.
   Joyce Cohen, 39, was spared the electric chair when Circuit
Judge Fredricka Smith backed a jury's recommendation of a life
term. Under law, she cannot be paroled for 25 years.
   Prosecutors claimed the Cohens' 11-year marriage had soured and
Mrs. Cohen feared a divorce would end her jet-set lifestyle.
Defense attorneys tried to blame the slaying of 52-year-old Stanley
Cohen on his purported drug connections.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Cohen hired three men to kill her husband,
supplied a map of their Coconut Grove home, disconnected the
alarms, unlocked the door and gave them her husband's gun. Cohen
was shot in the head four times at their home in 1986.

   The House today voted for the third time to
repeal catastrophic medical coverage for retirees, setting the
scene for the Senate to offer one last proposal to salvage some of
the benefits.
   The House vote was 352-63. Senators were preparing to send the
House a compromise offer to kill the unpopular surtax that finances
catastrophic benefits under the Medicare system and preserve some
parts of the program.
   ``At this late date and hour, the only prudent action this House
can take is force the Senate into voting for repeal,'' Rep. Clay
Shaw, R-Fla., said as Congress looked for a solution to one of the
two major obstacles to adjournment for the year.
   ``We are throwing out the baby with the bath water,'' said Rep.
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.
   The program was enacted a year ago to prevent a major illness
from plunging retirees into bankruptcy. Many of those retirees are
objecting to having to pay for the program because they have
private insurance coverage; some higher-income retirees don't like
having to pay an income surtax of up to $800 a year to finance the
benefits.
   Congressional leaders say the House and Senate will not adjourn
for the year without repealing the surtax.

   Former President Ronald Reagan postponed a

   ``Because of the tragedy which has befallen the Jesuit

   Several students and people living off campus called
Jesuit-operated Loyola Marymount to protest Reagan's visit in light

   Some callers blamed Reagan's policies in El Salvador for
contributing to the slayings Thursday, said Herbst.
   The six priests, their housekeeper and her daughter were shot to
death at their home behind the Catholic university in San Salvador.
Men wearing military uniforms were spotted entering the university
before the slaying.
   Melaney Nunez, Loyola's student body president, said the campus
was looking forward to Reagan's rescheduled visit, probably in late
January. The visit was sponsored by the students, their Republican

   President Bush's senior advisers will
recommend he sign a $14.6 billion foreign aid bill following an
apparent truce on a provision that the White House believed would
reduce its flexibility in carrying out foreign policy, an
administration official said today.
   The provision bars the use of U.S. aid money to entice foreign
governments to carry out policies banned by American law. It grew
out of the Iran-Contra affair, in which aid to Honduras was
expedited in return for Honduras' agreement to shelter the
Nicaraguan Contras at a time when Congress had banned U.S. military
assistance to the rebels.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., in a statement on the House floor, said
today that the provision refers only to clear written or oral
agreements with other governments and ``is not an attempt to
hamstring government officials in the course of their normal
duties.''
   The administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Bush now was being advised to approve the measure.
   In another area of controversy within the bill, Congress
rejected attempts to restrict U.S. military aid to El Salvador, but
there were signs that a week of heightened violence has left
lawmakers wary of continuing what one called a ``blank-check''
policy.
   ``After 10 years of bankrolling failure, it is time we changed
our policy,'' said Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore. ``Have we no right to
ask why after almost $4 billion spent, after 70,000 lives lost, why
our policy has not produced different results?''
   Both the House and the Senate on Monday voted down efforts to
curb the $85 million in U.S. military aid due to flow to the
government of President Alfredo Cristiani in the coming year,
heeding a call by President Bush not to further weaken that
country's new administration.
   After a debate that rekindled old animosities over El Salvador,
the House voted 215 to 194 to effectively keep the restrictions
from being added to the foreign aid bill, which contains money for
U.S. allies around the globe and the first cash in a new aid
program for Poland and Hungary.
   It sent the bill to the Senate, which rejected a similar
amendment by a 58-39 margin and forwarded the measure to Bush for
his signature.
   Bush earlier in the day had termed any attempt to cut off aid to
the Cristiani government ``absolutely unacceptable,'' and added:
``This is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that is
under attack ... It's totally unacceptable, and the day of these
Marxist attacks should end right now.''
   But the past week's violence in El Salvador appeared to have
created a shift of roughly 20 votes in the Senate since the body
voted 82-18 Sept. 20 for military aid with no conditions.
   And the House followed its rejection of strings on the military
aid with nearly unanimous approval of a resolution warning that
future aid would hinge on whether Cristiani tracks down and puts on
trial those responsible for the murder last week of six Jesuit
priests and two apparent witnesses to the killings. The vote was
409-3.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said lawmakers were coming under
heavy pressure from Christian groups to take action against El
Salvador, including heavy lobbying and demonstrations at some
members' district offices.
   In Washington, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
expressed support for proposals ``to withhold substantial portions
of military aid while the performance of the Salvadoran government
and military is tested.''
   And opponents of U.S. aid heckled Bush during an appearance in
Chicago, while others in Washington repeatedly interrupted Senate
floor proceedings and were forcibly ejected from the chamber by
Capitol police.
   In El Salvador, a pitched weeklong battle that has cost more
than 1,000 lives was winding down as the leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front withdrew from the capital
of San Salvador into the countryside.
   In the House, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., had proposed to add
language that would have held back 30 percent of this fiscal year's
military money until after April 1 of next year to keep pressure on
the Salvadoran government to solve the Jesuit murders.
   A similar proposal in the Senate, pushed by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., would have withheld 30 percent of the military aid until the
killers of the priests were apprehended and brought to trial.
   But Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., called it ``a terrible amendment,''
and added: ``If we pass it, we reward the communist terrorists ...
and punish the democratically elected government.''
   ``To rush into this breech with this kind of amendment is
suicide, gentlemen, for that country,'' argued Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y. ``This amendment is a selective response to a great
tragedy.''
   ``This is not a debate over who are the good guys and who are
the bad guys,'' countered Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., ``This is a
debate over whether the United States has an obligation to assure
that taxpayer dollars are going to a government that protects human
rights.''
   Bush said he had personally told Cristiani ``how strongly we
feel about the killings.''
   ``And I told him that they must get to the bottom of it. I am
convinced they will. The people who did this, whether they come
from the extreme left or the extreme right, pay the penalty,'' Bush
said.
   Major aid items included in the bill were $3 billion for Israel,
$2.1 billion for Egypt, $500 million for Turkey, $300 million for
Greece, $440 million for the four Central American democracies,
$533 million for Poland and Hungary, $125 million for the drug war
in Bolivia, Peru and Colombia and $160 million for a new
international development initiative for the Philippines.

   Fifty-four people were injured and more than 4,000 homes were
destroyed when a quake hit central Sichuan in September, and five
earthquakes measuring up to 6.7 on the Richter scale left 11 dead
in western Sichuan in June and July.

<HEAD>Plan Designed To Ensure Eligible Children Get Disability Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday announced plans to
more carefully review cases in which severely disabled children
have been denied Supplemental Security Income benefits.
   The new procedures were announced by Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan after a study by the Social Security
Adminstration found that some eligible children had been improperly
denied SSI benefits.
   The SSI program provides a minimum income floor to 4.5 mil   ``I want
to be personally assured that all needy children
entitled to disability benefits receive them and the critical
medical coverage that often accompanies receipt of SSI through
eligibility to the Medicaid program,'' Sullivan said.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King said the new steps
were taken after a review of 927 cases in which children were
denied disability benefits found that 59 youngsters had been
improperly turned down.
   Mrs. King said the overall error rate was not statistically
significant, but that certain categories of youngsters were
particularly prone to error, such as those under age 3 and those
suffering from congenital, cardiovascular, digestive or mental
disabilities.
   Sullivan directed Social Security officials to do the following:
   _Review all cases of disabled children from birth through age 3
twice before a claim is denied, and conduct double reviews for
older children in certain categories prone to error.
   _Hire more pediatricians to help judge and review childhood
claims since they are expert in the growth and development of
children.
   _Review and revise the medical criteria used to determine which
chidren are eligible for SSI benefits.
   _Intensify training and education of all disability examiners
and medical personnel to improve their understanding of childhood
disabilities.

<HEAD>State-run Newspaper Attacks New East German Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with premier warning East Germany
may impose unpopular measures; picks up 2nd pvs, `In West Germany ...'
^By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state-run newspaper today sharply
criticized Communist Party chief Egon Krenz, saying he has not won
popular trust.
   Premier Hans Modrow meanwhile it is about to impose ``unpopular
measures'' aimed at curbing black-market currency trading that has
flourished since the lifting of travel restrictions on Nov. 9.
   Modrow's statement, as reported by the official news agency ADN,
left unclear whether the leadership will try to cut down on the
number of East Germans who can travel to the West. More than 6
million visitors have already reached West Germany and West Berlin.
   In West Germany, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Krenz
could be ousted as the nation's top leader within four weeks. Krenz
himself acknowledged in a television interview Sunday he could lose
his power during a party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17.
   On Monday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visiting chief of staff,
Rudolf Seiters, predicted East Germany will hold free elections as
soon as next fall. He also said he expects the Communists'
constitutional guarantee of government control to be eliminated
next year.
   Also today, the European Community said an envoy would visit
East Berlin Dec. 4 and 5 to discuss East Germany's request for a
broad trade and economic cooperation accord.
   There has been intense speculation about Krenz's future over the
past week. Major changes are expected soon in East Germany's
leadership, which includes both reformers as well as holdovers from
the era of hard-liner Erich Honecker.
   The state-run National-Zeitung daily newspaper reminded its
readers that Krenz belonged to the ``leadership body that is now in
the crossfire of criticism.''
   In its commentary today, the newspaper also emphasized Krenz's
praise for the Chinese leadership after it crushed the student
pro-democracy movement in June, and brought up Krenz's alleged role
in massive election fraud in May.
   ``Egon Krenz cannot make up lost ground,'' the commentary said.
   East Germany's state-run press, which used to reflect the party
leadership's line without fail, has been reporting a greater
variety of views in recent weeks.
   In Hamburg, the conservative Bild newspaper said in a front-page
headline: ``Experts Agree: Krenz Has Only Four Weeks.''
   Bild did not name the experts. The newspaper is published by the
giant Springer group, which long has been critical of East
Germany's leadership.
   The official ADN news agency said more than 400,000 took to the
streets of Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, and Karl-Marx-Stadt in what has
become a Monday night ritual of challenge to Communist rule.
   Street protests that began last month and a mass emigration of
young skilled workers have prompted a shakeup in country's
leadership, exacting from it promises of fundamental reform and the
opening of the country's borders to free travel on Nov. 9.
   In Leipzig, demonstrators denounced government errors that have
ruined the economy.
   Most of East Germany's organized opposition groups are believed
to oppose German reunification, but there were calls for German
unity among some at the Leipzig rally.
   ``We must not suppress the will for unity. We are one people,''
one unidentified speaker said.
   Seiters met with Krenz and Modrow for talks to work out a visit
by Kohl next month.
   No date has been set for the visit, but it is expected before
Christmas and after the East German Communist Party congress on
Dec. 15-17.
   During the talks Monday, Krenz indicated the Communist Party is
striving for free general elections, but that their date depended
on how quickly the Parliament would pass the new election law,
Seiters told reporters.
   The West German official, Kohl's troubleshooter for East
Germany, talked for three hours with Krenz and Modrow in the
presence of aides and then had a 45-minute private chat with the
top Communists.

   Workers cleared streets of trees and power lines today after
wind storms left more than 200,000 East Coast homes and businesses
without power, battered four parked jets in metropolitan New York
and fanned a three-block fire in New Jersey.
   Winds of 63 mph were blamed for the death of a Baltimore woman
killed when a warehouse fell on her home. Snow from the same cold
front was blamed for the deaths of two young men whose pickup
slammed into a tractor-trailer in western Pennsylvania.
   The fire early today in Newark, N.J., left at least 35 families
in a poor area homeless, Mayor Sharpe James said. Gusts to 50 mph
spread the blaze to more than a dozen houses and apartment
buildings, but no injuries were reported.
   ``We expected it to be windy but we didn't expect it to be this
strong,'' said Clyde Dossett of the National Weather Service in
Wilmington, Del., where the wind was clocked at 59 mph.
   In New York City, 18 panes of glass popped loose from a building
under construction, raining glass on the street and tying up
traffic in midtown Manhattan.
   Gusts to 64 mph lifted a parked Continental Airlines jetliner
and dropped it on a baggage cart and fuel truck at Newark
International Airport.
   No passengers were on the Boeing 727, but a worker inside the
craft's baggage area suffered minor injuries, authorities said.
   Three Pan Am planes parked outside a hangar at New York's
Kennedy International were damaged by 44 mph gusts, police said.
   The wind blew a 747 into the hangar and pushed another 747 into
a fence. Metal scaffolding around a third plane, an A-300 airbus,
was blown into the aircraft's skin.
   ``The storm came in fast and furious and ended almost as
quickly,'' police Lt. Kevin Hassett said. The airport was shut for
45 minutes Monday night.
   Planes at LaGuardia Airport in New York City also were delayed
for about an hour by the wind.
   Farther north winds up to 50 mph combined with ice and up to 13
inches of snow in Vermont to make driving nearly impossible this
morning.
   ``It's bad; it's bad; it's bad,'' said Ray Burke of the state
Highway Department. ``We've got some areas where it's white-out.
You can't see past your windshield.''
   Utility officials said more than 200,000 customers lost power at
the peak of storms Monday night that swirled out of a strong cold
front moving across the Eastern Seaboard.
   Utility crews worked through the night to get the number of
customers blacked out in the District of Columbia, and Prince
George's and Montgomery counties, Md., down from 20,000 to 14,000
by 7 a.m., said the Potomac Electric Power Co.
   Virginia Power reported all but 1,300 of 11,000 customers who
lost power had electricity again. Baltimore Gas and Electric put
all but 16,000 of 65,000 affected customers back in service by 5
a.m., and utilities worked to get power back to nearly 110,000
customers in metropolitan New York.

   Demonstrators demanding an end to U.S. aid to El Salvador linked
arms and surrounded San Francisco's Federal Building today for a
second day, and police said 131 people were arrested.
   More than 2,000 people around the United States joined
demonstrations Monday, tying up traffic in Seattle and heckling
President Bush. At least 230 were arrested Monday.
   ``We know what this place is for; murder in El Salvador,''
chanted about 400 protesters outside the Federal Building in San
Francisco today. Newsracks were overturned and scuffles broke out
between protesters and people trying to enter the building to go to
work.
   The latest round of outrage focused on last week's slaying of
six Jesuit priests, their houskeeper and her daughter in El
Salvador.
   The demonstrators blamed the killings on right-wing elements in
the central American country's military. The slayings occurred amid
heavy fighting as the government drove leftist rebels from the
capital, San Salvador.
   ``It has become very clear over this decade that United States
aid ... is that which is destroying the people of El Salvador,''
the Rev. William Wood, executive director of the California
Catholic Conference, said during the San Francisco demonstration.
   ``There is no democracy in El Salvador as long as the army is in
control. No one elects the army,'' Wood said.
   Protests also were held Monday in New York City, Spokane, Wash.,
and Newark and Camden, N.J.
   The demonstrations came as the U.S. House rejected 215-194 an
attempt to restrict up to $85 million in military aid to the
country.
   The House approved 409-3 a non-binding resolution saying that
bringing the priests' killers to justice would ``be instrumental in
determining continued U.S. support'' for El Salvador.
   Bush defended his support of what he called a freely elected
government, and defended the government of Salvadoran President
Alfredo Christiani against accusations of complicity in the
killings.
   At a political fund-raiser in Chicago, Bush rebuked hecklers who
accused his administration of responsibility for the deaths.
   ``We are not. You be quiet,'' Bush shot back.
   Four people were led out by security guards as the crowd
applauded. The four, including three women who said they were Roman
Catholic nuns, were charged with disorderly conduct.
   Six people who demonstrated outside the hotel where the
fund-raiser was held were arrested for obstructing traffic and
other minor charges. All 10 were released on their own recognizance.
   In Washington, D.C., about 200 people demonstrated and nine
people who staged a protest in the Senate galleries were arrested,
Capitol police said.
   In Seattle, about 300 people demonstrated, some carrying wooden
crosses.
   A mass of protesters up to three deep blocked southbound lanes
of Interstate 5 and an exit ramp near the downtown Federal
Courthouse, creating a 3-mile back up during morning rush hour.
   They were dragged away by police as fellow protesters chanted,
``No more bombs, no more war, U.S. out of El Salvador.''
   Seventy-two people were arrested, police said. Sixty were given
tickets for obstructing traffic and 12 were cited for refusing to
give their names or resisting arrest. All were released.
   In San Francisco on Monday, more than 600 people, including 150
Jesuits, staged a sit-in at the Federal Building and prayed for the
thousands slain in El Salvador's civil war.
   Authorities arrested 136 people, including priests, for blocking
doors to the building or blocking the sidewalk. Virtually all were
cited and released.
   About 250 people took part in similar marches and vigils at
Stanford University and about 150 at San Francisco State University.
   In Spokane, about 50 people marched nearly a mile from a Roman
Catholic church to the downtown office of House Speaker Tom Foley,
D-Wash, toting banners that read ``Salvadorans Forgive Us.''
   Eleven were arrested for refusing to leave Foley's office. Foley
was in Washington, D.C.
   About 500 protesters gathered outside a military recruiting
office in Times Square in New York City, said police Sgt. Maurice
Howard.
   Between 50 and 60 people held a protest at the Newark, N.J.,
office of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and 25 to 30 demonstrated
in Camden, N.J.

<HEAD>Reagan Lawyers Say Subpoena Raises Constitutional Questions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan's attorneys indicated
Wednesday they were considering a challenge to a subpoena for
Reagan to produce documents and testify at the Iran-Contra trial of
his former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter.
   In court papers asking for a two-week delay, Reagan's private
attorneys said the subpoena ``raises novel and complex
constitutional issues'' about the power of courts over a former
chief executive.
   The subpoena ``raises weighty and yet unsettled constitutional
issues regarding the doctrine of separation of powers and the
executive privilege,'' Reagan's lawyers said.
   The former president was directed by the subpoena to turn over
documents needed for Poindexter's trial by Wednesday.
   The Justice Department also sought a delay until Dec. 6 for
responding to a subpoena for Reagan papers that are held by the
National Archives and Records Administration.
   The subpoenas were served last week after they were approved by
the judge in the Poindexter case.
   Reagan's former national security adviser is scheduled to go on
trial Jan. 22 in federal court here on charges of making false
statements to Congress and obstructing congressional inquiries into
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Defense lawyers have suggested that Reagan knew about letters
that Poindexter sent to Congress in response to queries about
whether the administration was secretly aiding the Nicaraguan
rebels at a time when such assistance was banned by law. Poindexter
is accused of falsely assuring Congress there was no such
assistance.
   Reagan's pleading, filed by a team of lawyers headed by Theodore
B. Olson, suggested that the former president may invoke the
doctrine of executive privilege to resist turning over certain
documents or answering certain questions.
   Executive privilege was invoked by then-President Nixon during
the Watergate scandal when he tried to withhold tapes of
conversations he had with aides in the Oval Office.
   In a 1974 decision that ultimately led to Nixon's resignation,
the Supreme Court ordered him to turn over the tapes.
   The high-court's 8-0 ruling, however, appeared to leave room for
possible assertions of executive privilege to protect diplomatic,
military or state secrets.
   Reagan's lawyers note that Poindexter's request for documents
covers 67 separate subjects and the list itself is highly
classified.
   The attorneys also raised the possibility that President Bush
may seek to invoke executive privilege to block release of some of
the documents.
   In its pleading, the Justice Department said that it had an
``obvious and strong interest'' in the subpoena served on Reagan
``because of the sensitive nature and subject of the subpoena
directed to him and the potential relationship of the materials
sought to the national interest and to the presidency.''
   The Justice Department said that some of the documents sought
from the government and from Reagan may be covered by the
Classified Information Procedures Act, which regulates the
disclosure of government secrets in court.

<HEAD>Nureyev Steps Down, Ending Soap Opera at Paris Opera</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-month battle between Rudolf Nureyev and the
president of the Paris Opera Ballet ended Tuesday when the
Soviet-born dancer resigned as dance director of the company he
helped bring to prominence.
   A statement issued after a meeting between Nureyev and President
Pierre Berge said the two ``decided mutually that Nureyev should
step down as dance director.''
   The break, however, sounded more like a separation than divorce.
The statement said Nureyev would stay on as ``premier
choreographer,'' a post created for him ``to insure the presence of
his productions at the Paris Opera.''
   Nureyev, 51, had been artistic director since 1983.
   The Paris Opera became almost a soap opera in recent weeks, with
tensions mounting as Nureyev and Berge exchanged charges in the
press.
   Nureyev's contract as dance director expired Aug. 31.
Interviewed last month by the newspaper Le Figaro, he complained he
had not heard from Berge, whom he later described as harder to
reach than God.
   Berge retorted that it was difficult to communicate with someone
who is so rarely in Paris.
   Nureyev has been frequently absent. He is touring the United
States with ``The King and I,'' and is scheduled to play the lead
role immortalized by Yul Brenner for another two years.
   Berge called for the dancer's contract to include a six-month
residence clause with the ballet company _ which Nureyev was
certain to refuse. Insiders said Berge hoped to boost the morale of
the ballet company, which has not appreciated Nureyev's part-time,
long-distance directing.
   Nureyev has been replaced temporarily by ballet masters Patrice
Bart and Eugene Polyakov, whom Nureyev trained and brought into the
company.
   Controversy is nothing new to Berge, who has never been one to
back down from a public showdown.
   Last year, he fired Daniel Barenboim as director of the new
Opera-Bastille opera house over his high fees and alleged elitist
views on opera.
   Nureyev is not expected to disappear like Barenboim. His
``Sleeping Beauty'' is on the program Dec. 16-31 and his ``Swan
Lake'' can be seen from April 21-May 13, 1990. And as ``premier
choreographer'' he is expected to revive ``La Bayadere'' in time
for next summer.
   Dance afficcionados say that's only fitting for the man who
defected to the West from a Paris airport with the apparent
approval of then-Culture Minister Andre Malraux.

<HEAD>Gasoline, Food Push Consumer Prices Up in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher gasoline and food costs pushed consumer
prices up 0.5 percent last month, giving the country its biggest
spurt of inflation since last May, the government reported Tuesday.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index,
which translated into an annual inflation rate of 5.9 percent,
followed four months in which the index recorded tiny gains of 0.2
percent or less.
   October's inflation spurt was blamed on a statistical jump in
gasoline costs, hefty increases in dairy products and fruit and
rising costs for new cars and clothing.
   Economists for the most part discounted the increase, saying it
did not shake their belief that price pressures will remain
moderate in coming months.
   ``This is the first month in five that inflation has been in the
problem range and most likely it will not persist,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Inflation raced upward in the first five months of the year,
only to moderate through the summer as energy prices retreated.
   Through the first 10 months of the year, consumer prices have
been rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from
the 4.4 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted that
the increase in consumer prices for the entire year will hold at
4.6 percent and will improve to 4.2 percent next year.
   ``The October increase was just a make-up for some unusually
good numbers in the last few months,'' he said. ``With the slowdown
in the economy, we think we will get another year of stability in
prices.''
   The Bush administration was also sanguine about October's price
increase with presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater noting that
in the past six months, the CPI has risen at an annual rate of just
3.3 percent.
   ``This is lower than for any six-month period since December
1986, and lower than the average inflation of 3.6 percent over the
last seven years. So inflation holds relatively steady but at a low
level,'' Fitzwater said.
   Gasoline costs climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent in
October, the biggest jump since last May. Gasoline prices have been
on a roller-coaster ride this year, soaring by 21.2 percent in the
first five months and then falling by 9.3 percent from June through
September.
   Pump prices actually were unchanged in October, but they
normally fall at the end of the summer driving season. Thus, the
frozen price level translated into an increase after the Labor
Department made adjustments to take into account normal seasonal
pricing variations.
   Food costs were up 0.4 percent, the biggest advance since a 0.6
percent May increase. Dairy products posted a huge gain for the
second straight month, rising by 1.8 percent, the biggest increase
in more than nine years. Fruit and vegetable prices jumped 1.2
percent, led by big gains in the cost of apples and bananas.
   Consumer prices minus food and energy costs, the inflation
measure considered to be a good guage of underlying price
pressures, rose 0.5 percent in October, matching the increase in
the overall index.
   New car prices, reflecting the introduction of 1990 models and
higher financing costs, rose 0.6 percent after having fallen for
five consecurtive months. Used car prices, however, continued to
decline, edging down 0.1 percent.
   Clothing costs, which took a big 1.7 percent rise in September,
rose another 1 percent in October, reflecting higher costs for the
fall and winter lines.
   Home heating oil costs were up a sharp 2.5 percent while natural
gas and electricity prices rose a more modest 0.3 percent.
   Medical costs, which rose 0.7 percent in October, are 8.1
percent higher than a year ago, the biggest increase of any of the
major price categories.
   The Federal Reserve, which began the year fighting inflation by
pushing interest rates higher, has been lowering rates in recent
months because of concerns over widespread economic weakness.
   Many analysts predicted that the October blip in consumer prices
would not deter the Fed from making further credit easing moves in
the months ahead.
   ``The Fed doesn't like to see the inflation rates this high but
the economy is very weak right now and that is their overriding
concern,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal variations, the
Consumer Price Index stood at 125.6 in October, meaning that a
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the
1982-84 base period would have cost $125.60 last month, up from
$120.20 a year ago.
   In a separate report Tuesday, the Labor Department said that
Americans' average weekly earnings rose to $343.07 in October, 4
percent higher than a year ago, but not enough to keep up with
inflation during this time period.

<HEAD>World Bank Would Reverse Declines in Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Embargoed for 6:30 p.m. EST; time set by source. ^By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank on Tuesday offered a long-term
program aimed at reversing the decline of schools, incomes and
farming in large parts of Africa during the 1980s.
   The program proposes policy changes to allow African governments
to reach a goal of 5 percent growth in annual income, more emphasis
on helping Africans take responsibility for improving their lives,
better administration, checking the population growth and
protecting its enviornment, and more foreign aid.
   The World Bank, which lends about $4 billion a year to black
Africa, is the largest single source of aid to Third World
countries. Its proposal was outlined in a 314-page report,
``Sub-Saharan Africa _ From Crisis to Sustainable Growth.''
   ``This report examines... what has gone wrong and why,'' World
Bank president Barber Conable said at a news conference. ``More
importantly, it lays out a strategic agenda for the 1990s.''
   The report deals with the entire African continent, except the
northern tier of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco,
Namibia and the Republic of South Africa in the far south.
   Conable said he wanted changes in some nations' military
spending, but declined to cite specific countries.
   ``Military spending has diverted enormous resources from
southern Africa's development, and has consumed nearly 50 percent
of government expenditures in the countries experiencing the worst
destabilization,'' the report said.
   Conable said that, for the first time, defense costs will be
formally taken into account in discussions between the bank and
African countries. It's also expected to be an element in
negotiations of the bank's sister organization, the International
Monetary Fund.
   The report predicted that black Africa's population would grow
by 3.1 percent a year until the end of the century, the same rate
as in the 1980s and six times as fast as the average in high-income
countries.
   Because total production in few African countries has been
growing at that speed, there would have to be considerable
improvement to keep average incomes from declining further.
   The report emphasized the need to increase African food
production to keep up with population. African farms increased
their output by only 1.3 percent from 1980 to 1987, less than half
the rise in population.
   African imports of grain nearly doubled between 1974 and 1986,
while shipments sent as aid by the United States and other
countries more than tripled over the same period.
   The report called for continued relief from debts owed by
African countries, mainly to western governments, so that payments
in the 1990s are kept to the same level as in the 1980s _ about $9
billion a year.
   ``If this does not occur, higher levels of external assistance
will be necessary,'' it warned.
   Figures used by the World Bank showed total aid rising from $11
billion in 1987 to $13 billion in 1988. Aid from the United States
has been declining, from $1.35 billion in 1986 to $738 million in
1988.

   Armed rebels today stormed a
luxury hotel in northern San Salvador and held dozens of foreigners
inside. Four U.S. military advisers were reported captured.
   Soldiers in an armored personnel carrier rescued the secretary
general of the Organization of American States, who had been inside
a different part of the building when the leftist guerrillas
attacked.
   Six government helicopters flew over the homes and tennis club
around the Sheraton Hotel in the wealthy neighborhood of Escalon.
Hundreds of soldiers moved into the area, frequently pinned down by
guerrilla fire.
   The army moved several tanks into the neighborhood to combat the
attackers, who were renewing an urban offensive that had appeared
to be dying out.
   Four U.S. military advisers, and two other advisers, one from
Colombia and one from Guatemala, were captured near the hotel, said
Antonio Hernandez, a spokesman for the rebels' Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front in Mexico City.
   ``They are considered prisoners, but we will respect their lives
and they will not be harmed,'' Hernandez said.
   Cable News Network, quoting an army spokesman, Col. Carlos
Amando Aviles, said four Americans were being held at the hotel.
Aviles did not say whether the Americans were in the military.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said he was unable to confirm
the report.
   ``I haven't heard that,'' he said by telephone. ``I don't think
it's true but I can't be sure.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Bush administration was ``making plans as necessary'' to protect
the lives of Americans in the hotel.
   Twenty-nine people, mostly foreigners, were held by the
guerrillas.
   The FMLN asked the government to agree to allow a Red Cross team
to come to the hotel and evacuate guests, aside from the military
advisers, Hernandez said.
   The rebels held a part of the hotel known as the VIP Tower.
Hotel executives and others, including OAS chief Joao Baena Soares,
holed up in an administrative office in the main building.
   Baena Soares, on a peace mission to El Salvador, told the hotel
manager that he wanted to be evacuated with the other guests.
Later, soldiers in an armored personnel carrier drove up to the
front of the main building and evacuated him. It was not
immediately clear whether others were taken with him.
   Brown said the embassy maintained an open line to some of the
Americans in the hotel but said he did not know how many were
there. Fifty-five U.S. military advisers are in El Salvador.
   ``The objective is to take Escalon,'' said a guerrilla who gave
his name as ``Marlon.'' He was in charge of an insurgent position
80 yards from the four-star hotel.
   ``We're taking Escalon because here the armed forces are not
going to bombard people's homes. This is where the oligarchy
lives,'' Marlon said.
   He said his rebel unit had been in Mejicanos, one of several
poor suburbs and neighborhoods where the guerrillas dug in during
their massive offensive last week.
   The fighting ended several days of relative calm in San
Salvador, one target of a rebel offensive launched Nov. 11.
   The new attack comes one day after President Bush reaffirmed his
administration's strong support for the right-wing government of
President Alfredo Cristiani. The United States has provided about
$3.5 billion in the past 10 years to help the government fight the
insurgency.
   A guerrilla official in Mexico City said Monday the offensive
would continue because the fighting had not yet convinced the
government that it cannot win the war. Salvador Samayoa said the
offensive would keep on ``with other surprises bigger than that of
Nov. 11'' until the government is convinced it must make
concessions and begin to negotiate.
   At least 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds if not
thousands rendered homeless in the latest offensive.
   A British journalist, Paul Iredale, was wounded today in the
lower back and taken to the Hospital Rosales. Iredale, a Reuters
reporter based in Mexico City, was later reported in fair condition.
   The fighting followed several explosions and exchanges of rifle
fire in the western sector of the capital at 4:30 a.m.
   The blasts appeared to come from the direction of Merliot, a
suburb where combat flared Monday, or from the slopes of the San
Salvador volcano that looms over the capital's northwestern sector.
   A little less than an hour later, other explosions were heard
echoing from the direction of the volcano and an airplane equipped
with rockets and machine-guns was heard making passes over the
city's outskirts.
   The later blasts appeared to be from heavy munitions, perhaps
120mm government mortars.
   Officials said the rebels had blown up seven of the country's 16
main power lines along with about 40 towers and other equipment.
   The fighting then moved to the area surrounding the Sheraton.
The hotel's coffee shop was the site of the Jan. 3, 1981 slayings
of the president of the Salvadoran Institute of Agrarian Reform and
U.S. AFL-CIO advisers, Michael P. Hammer, 39, of Potomac, Md. and
Mark David Pearlman, 36, of Seattle. Two National Guardsmen were
convicted of murder in the killings, but released in 1988 under an
amnesty given for political crimes.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker was asked Monday if the raids,
the massacre of six Jesuit priests on Thursday and other incidents
indicated Cristiani was having trouble maintaining control over the
more extreme elements in his rightist government.
   ``Management control problems exist in situations like this,''
said Walker. In Washington, Congress also rejected attempts to
restrict U.S. military aid to Cristiani, heeding an admonition from
Bush not to further weaken a ``freely, democratically elected
government.''
   The decade-long war has claimed more than 71,000 lives, mostly
civilians.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has received a message from
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat about Middle
East peace talks, the White House said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called it ``a private message'' and
refused to divulge its contents.
   ``The president has received an oral message from Arafat
delivered through the established diplomatic channels in Tunisia,''
Fitzwater said.
   The message went through Ambassador Robert Pelletreau, the U.S.
point man for contacts with the PLO.
   ``We won't reflect on the content of the message. There are no
plans at this time for the president to respond,'' Fitzwater said.
``The situation is not measurably altered. We still have not heard
from the Egyptians on our peace proposal ideas.''
   Israel has accepted _ with some reservations _ Secretary of
State James A. Baker III's five-point plan to promote talks between
the Israelis and Palestinians before an election on the West Bank
and in Gaza.
   The message from Arafat was received ``in the last couple of
days.''
   ``It was a private message and was sent orally in order to keep
it private, and we will maintain that confidence,'' Fitzwater said.
   The United States opened the diplomatic channel to the PLO late
last year after Arafat foreswore terrorism and recognized Israel's
right to exist.

   Eighteen of the 20 college fraternity
pledges who infuriated police by saying nothing but ``Sheep run
north, sir,'' have been told charges will be dropped if they stay
out of trouble for three months.
   The other two did not show up in court on Monday and their cases
were rescheduled.
   The 20 Pace University students were charged with disorderly
conduct Oct. 13 when they refused to tell police what they were
doing at 2 a.m. walking on Route 9A. They would only respond with
the phrase, ``Sheep run north, sir.''
   Members of Delta Kappa Epsilon had driven the pledges,
blindfolded, up near the Croton Dam and dropped them off with no
identification and no money.
   The pledges were ordered to use only the ``sheep'' phrase if
anyone asked them anything. They were walking back to school when
police stopped them.
   All 20 were arrested and given disorderly conduct tickets.

<TEXT>
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King on
Tuesday announced a plan to ``calm the turbulence'' in her
discontented workforce to ensure that agency employees provide
quality service to the public.
   In a speech to 14,000 Social Security Administration workers in
the Baltimore area, transmitted by satellite to employees
elsewhere, Mrs. King said morale has suffered in recent years as a
result of massive staff cuts at a time when the Social Security
workload was increasing.
   ``I don't believe we can guarantee the kind of public service we
need to ... unless we first take steps to ensure that our workforce
is energized and focused on our mission,'' she told reporters in a
preview of the speech.
   To her employees, she acknowledged: ``I realize that many of you
feel overworked, that you don't believe your efforts are properly
recognized and that many of you wouldn't recommend SSA employment
to a friend.''
   ``In the weeks and months ahead, I will have no higher priority
than to heal these wounds,'' she said. ``I want to calm the
turbulence and replace uncertainty with stability.''
   The agency's workforce has been slashed by 20 percent to 65,000
over the last six years as part of a campaign to modernize and
streamline operations. Surveys showed increasing numbers of
supervisors felt the agency was doing a poor job of providing top
quality service to the public.
   ``When you combine cutbacks in the size of the agency with
increased public demand for service, turmoil is likely to be the
result,'' Mrs. King told reporters. ``I believe we have to get
beyond that.''
   Mrs. King, who assumed the top Social Security job in August,
proposed a new ``compact'' with her employees. For her part, she
promised to resist further staff cuts, adjust uneven staffing
levels that create shortages in some offices, communicate with
employees in advance of major program changes, provide more
equipment such as computer terminals, and relax unreasonably
demanding job performance standards.
   Employees, meanwhile, were asked to avoid internal strife,
become proficient in new technologies such as computers, take a
greater role in agency decisions and resolve to treat each member
of the public ``as a unique individual and not a case number or a
file.''
   Mrs. King also said additional emphasis would be placed on
outreach programs to needy people who may not be getting the
benefits to which they are entitled, and on efforts to ensure that
only trustworthy people are appointed to handle the Social Security
checks of those who cannot manage their own finances.

<HEAD>Discovery Launch Planned for After Dark Wednesday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Crews worked under a tight schedule
to ready the shuttle Discovery for an after-dark launch Wednesday
with a NASA spokesman predicting the crew would have Thanksgiving
turkey in space.
   Workers made up for time lost on a parts replacement earlier and
Kennedy Space Center spokesman Dick Young said ``from a technical
standpoint we look good and from a weather standpoint we look
good.''
   The launch time is a secret and so is the nature of the military
payload the crew of five is to put into orbit. NASA has said only
that liftoff is set between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. EST.
   There is only a 20 percent chance weather will interfere,
forecasters said. If the launch has to be Thursday, the weather
outlook worsens to 60 percent unfavorable.
   The menu released for the mission includes ``thermostabilized''
turkey and gravy, which means the food has enough preservatives to
be carried without refrigeration.
   ``We are hopeful the crew will have Thanksgiving dinner in
space,'' Young said.
   Checking systems and putting the two solid fuel booster rockets
back together had put the schedule in jeopardy. The rockets were
opened last week to inspect computer boxes for faulty wiring and
one box was replaced.
   The flight, commanded by Air Force Col. Frederick C. Gregory, is
the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the Defense
Department. Officials said keeping advance knowledge of the
expected liftoff time secret makes tracking the shuttle more
difficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship
sitting off Cape Canaveral.
   Announcement of an imminent launch will be made nine minutes
before the event, but there will be no public air-to-ground link
during the mission.
   The cargo is believed to be a satellite capable of monitoring
diplomatic and military communications in the Soviet Union and
other countries.
   The launch will be only the third after nightfall in 32 shuttle
missions and is, like the others, expected to provide a spectacular
sight in this central Florida area. The last night launch, in
November 1985, was visible along the 700 miles from Key West, Fla.,
to Charleston, S.C.
   Gregory, and the pilot Air Force Col. John Blaha, practiced
night landings on the shuttle runway here in a jet equipped to
handle like a shuttle.
   Disovery is scheduled to land at night at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., after a flight expected to last four days. Gregory
and Blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the dark here or
at emergency runways in Spain or North Africa in case of an abort
after liftoff.
   Gregory, who flew on a 1985 shuttle mission, is the first black
shuttle commander. The other crew members are Navy Capt. Manley L.
Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.

   Former federal judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. left
a halfway house Tuesday, after serving 20 months of a five-year
prison term for perjury and 18 days after the Senate removed him
from office.
   ``He was released on parole. He signed out at 8:15 a.m.,'' said
Robert English, community corrections manager in New Orleans for
the federal Bureau of Prisons.
   Nixon, 61, of Ocean Springs, Miss., reported to the Volunteers
of America halfway house July 17, after serving nearly 16 months in
the federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.
   A federal jury convicted Nixon in 1986 of lying to a federal
grand jury when he denied discussing a marijuana case with a
district attorney. He began serving his prison term March 23, 1988,
nearly two years after being sentenced.
   The Senate voted Nov. 3 to remove him from office, stripping him
of his title of U.S. district judge and $89,500 salary.
   The Senate voted 89-9 to convict Nixon of the charge of lying to
the grand jury when he denied discussing the marijuana case with
the prosecutor. Senators also voted 78-19 to convict him of lying
to a federal grand jury when he said he had nothing to do with the
marijuana case and had never tried to influence its outcome.
   After his removal, Nixon continued to maintain his innocence.
   ``We fought the fight for 5{ years. We know we're not guilty of
anything,'' said Nixon, the 16th federal official to be impeached.
``We can hold our heads high.''
   Attorney Boyce Holleman said Monday that Nixon plans to fight to
resume his law license _ an attempt which the Mississippi State Bar
Association's general counsel predicted would be an uphill battle.

   A jeweled silver sword belonging to U.S.
President Ulysses S. Grant sold for $330,000, a price auctioneers
called a world record.
   The ceremonial sword given to Grant by friends when he took
command of Union forces in 1864 during the Civil War brought the
highest price ever for such a weapon, said Laura Smissaert,
spokeswoman for auctioneers Butterfield &amp; Butterfield.
   ``It sets the world auction record for an American sword,'' she
said. ``It was a private buyer, you're not going to be seeing it in
a museum next week.''
   The buyer did not want to be identified, she said.
   The chased, or embossed and engraved, silver sword features
inset jewels and a gold plaque bearing Grant's initials set in
diamonds.
   The sword was auctioned Monday at a sale of other Civil War-era
military artifacts that included belongings of another Union Army
general, George Armstrong Custer.

<HEAD>William Shirer Gets Severance Pay _ 57 Years Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LENOX, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty-seven years ago William Shirer was
fired by the Chicago Tribune, a parting he has said made him feel
``very sorry for myself.''
   The author of the classic ``Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,''
finally got his severance pay Tuesday.
   Shirer, 85, said some of his experiences as a newsman in Europe
working for the Tribune still rankle. But he said, ``as time goes
by, the bitterness passes. Better late than never.''
   Shirer got a check Tuesday for $1,250 and an honorary Beck
award. The award is part of a trust fund named after the man who
fired Shirer, Edward Scott Beck.
   Tribune managing editor Richard Ciccone and Howard Tyner,
assistant managing editor for foreign and national news, visited
Shirer at his home in Lenox. The Tribune had invited Shirer to
attend their awards dinner Nov. 30, but Shirer declined because of
failing health.
   Ciccone said the awards dinner regularly includes skits and
other forms of entertainment and giving a check to Shirer seemed a
good way to break out of the routine.
   Shirer was working in Vienna when he was fired in 1932 for
mixing up the name of a woman who had been arrested by Austrian
police. He said Beck promised him a month's severance pay and he
went to Spain ``to collect my thoughts.''
   But the check never arrived, said Shirer, who was paid about
$200 a week at the time.
   Shirer, whose wartime remembrances ``The Nightmare Years'' were
recently made into a cable television miniseries, is currently at
work on a book about Leo Tolstoy.

   About a dozen people showed up at a
restaurant Tuesday to help in the renewed search for a 9-year-old
boy missing the past month in rugged south-central Oregon.
   There was no word of new discoveries in the search for Nathan
Madsen, said Tina Zech, who works at the Halfway House restaurant
where searchers have assembled since the discovery of the boy's
horse Sunday inspired volunteers to rejoin the family's search.
   Many of the volunteers had horses to help them cover more ground
and were veterans of the earlier search, which was disbanded for
lack of leads.
   The Veneta boy and his sorrel gelding disappeared Oct. 22 during
a family cattle roundup in canyons along the Little Deschutes River.
   Volunteers flocked to the area Monday after Jerry Madsen,
Nathan's father, found the boy's pony in a mountain meadow Sunday.
The pony's saddle and bridle were missing.
   The search Monday concentrated on the area where the horse was
found.
   Tim Birr, a spokesman for the searchers, said 64 people searched
Monday.

   Students at St. Andrews Presbyterian
College have set a world record for nonstop arguing, debating
topics from aquaculture to Gummi Bears and Jell-O, school officials
say.
   The St. Andrews Parliamentary Debate Society passed the previous
record for non-stop debating _ 100 hours and six minutes _ at 8:42
p.m. Monday, said school spokesman Steve Skinner.
   As the buzzer sounded, members of the audience stood on their
chairs and cheered. Debaters sprayed each other with champagne,
then took a permitted break before debating some more. They kept
going to 11:30 p.m.
   The previous record _ according to the Guinness Book of World
Records _ was held by Vassar College.
   The debate on solutions to world hunger began at 9:30 a.m.
Thursday. Along with discussing funding, aquaculture and
redistribution of food, they debated Gummi Bears, Jell-O and
Gatorade as possible solutions.
   Under the Guinness rules, a five-minute rest was allowed for
each hour of debate. Two witnesses had to be present at all times,
excluding the four debaters. The entire debate was filmed, Skinner
said. The debaters were allowed one hour of sleep a day, usually
from 5:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.

   City Council members are fed up with giant
gorillas looming over their city, but they plan to use the law
rather than squadrons of fighter planes to bring down the ersatz
King Kongs.
   The council tentatively approved an ordinance Monday that would
prohibit enormous inflated gorillas or any other oversized
inflatables for promotions or advertising. It would reduce their
size to about 3 feet, not very threatening to Fay Wray.
   ``We don't need a 20-foot gorilla on the side of Highway 9,''
said council member Jerry Cutrer. ``It's an eyesore, and it's
distracting to motorists and potentially dangerous.''
   Council member Jane Pruett said that on one recent weekend, the
strip of state Highway 9 through the Atlanta suburb was overrun
with ``monster things.''
   Businessmen defended the balloons.
   ``There are some that are ugly, but a lot of them aren't ugly _
it depends on which one you get,'' said Jud F. Carswell, who has
used the inflatables at his car dealership. ``If neighboring towns
allow it, it's going to be tougher'' to attract business.

   With a bellow of ``Order! Order!'' the gowned and
bewigged Speaker brought House of Commons lawmakers into line
Tuesday as TV cameras gave Britons their first pictures of their
elected legislators in action.
   Thirty years after first rejecting the notion, the elected
chamber of the Mother of Parliaments finally bowed to the
electronic age as eight remote-control cameras recorded the cut and
thrust of the government and the opposition, seated two sword
lengths and a foot apart.
   At precisely 2:30 p.m., Speaker Bernard Weatherill popped onto
TV screens, resplendent in shoulder-length horsehair wig and black
gown, and called the excited, fidgeting lawmakers to order.
   The first images were broadcast live by two of Britain's four
national networks and the satellite station, Sky Television.
   The honor of giving the first televised speech from the green
leather benches was given to Conservative Ian Gow, a former Cabinet
minister who opposes the cameras and says he doesn't know how to
operate his own VCR.
   But Labor lawmaker Bob Cryer beat him to it with a procedural
interjection during Weatherill's annual recitation of the Sessional
Orders, which remind lawmakers of parliamentary rules and instruct
Scotland Yard to ensure their free access to the Palce of
Westminster.
   Gow said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher invited him to her
Downing Street residence for a drink on the eve of the first
televised session. ``It seems we were both feeling rather nervous
about our speeches,'' he confessed in a radio interview.
   In her first televised speech, Mrs. Thatcher promised more of
her free-market medicine in 1990. Opposition Labor leader Neil
Kinnock attacked her policies as failures. The debate broke no new
ground, but seeing it on TV gave it an unusual sense of drama.
   Mrs. Thatcher was combative, at times shrill when the opposition
got raucous. Kinnock looked more relaxed.
   The unelected House of Lords has permitted TV broadcasts of its
proceedings since 1985, including the pageantry enveloping Queen
Elizabeth II's ceremonial State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday
morning.
   But the House of Commons, the often-rowdy elected chamber down
the hallway of the Palace of Westminster, steadfastly resisted
until February 1988. It then agreed to a nine-month experiment.
Radio broadcasting was approved in 1978.
   A parliamentary committee drafted strict rules for the cameras,
although the opening broadcasts appeared to be interpreting them
liberally.
   To deter lawmakers from mounting camera-grabbing spectacles, the
broadcasters are supposed to show only the head and shoulders of
whoever is speaking. They are also barred from showing empty
benches, lest viewers get the notion their representatives are
goofing off.
   But several speakers, including Kinnock, were shown from the
waist up as they spoke. The shots were wide enough to show the
facial reactions of several colleagues.
   Screening rowdiness is also taboo. At the first hint of a
disturbance, the cameras are to focus on Weatherill, who is elected
by fellow lawmakers to preside over debates and quell the booing
and braying that often interrupts debate.
   Weatherill, who turns 69 Saturday, is the son of a Savile Row
tailor who still carries a thimble in his pocket because his mother
said it would keep him humble.
   Weatherill approves of the televising, and said Tuesday he hoped
it ``will show the House of Commons at work as it really is.''
   The cameras occasionally switched to wide-angle shots, showing
the 650-member Commons packed to the aisles. The BBC called it a
``historic day,'' while Independent Television News spoke of ``the
newest drama in London's West End.''
   For the uninterested, two other channels offered ``Angel in
Exile,'' a low-budget Western, the drama serial ``Take the High
Road,'' the game show ``Tell the Truth,'' and ``Coronation
Street,'' the popular British soap opera.
   The separation of benches by swords' lengths dates from older
times, when it was feared heated debate might degenerate into
fighting.
   Many lawmakers chose special attire for their TV debut.
Conservative Bill Walker sported his Scots kilt and a Royal Air
Force tie.
   ``Narrow striped shirts have disappeared in favor of blue and
yellow. And the ties have got distinctly brighter this morning,''
said Conservative lawmaker Kenneth Hind.
   ``Hair has been shortened and some of the men ... are carrying
powder puffs in their pockets to beautify their sallow complexions
for the cameras,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher wore her customary blue suit.

<HEAD>Zaikov Removed as Moscow Party Boss, Named Deputy Defense Council
Chief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lev. N. Zaikov, the hard-liner who has served as
the Communist Party boss of Moscow for two years, was replaced
Tuesday to become President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's top deputy on
the Soviet Defense Council.
   Party officials called the move a promotion for Zaikov, who is
also a member of the ruling Soviet Politburo.
   He was succeeded as Moscow party boss by Yuri Prokofiev, 50, who
as second party secretary in the Soviet capital had been Zaikov's
deputy.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Zaikov, 66, received
the gratitude of the Moscow party committee that voted in plenary
session to replace him, indicating he was leaving in official good
graces.
   According to Tass, Zaikov's departure ``is connected to his
appointment to the post of the first deputy chairman of the Defense
Council of the U.S.S.R.''
   Gorbachev, in his role as president, chairs the Defense Council,
which is responsible for elaborating national defense policy and
whose membership was once top-secret.
   Zaikov will bring to the Defense Council experience in
military-related matters, since he formerly served under Gorbachev
as the party's top official overseeing the defense industry and in
1983-85 as party chief in the Leningrad region, one of the centers
of the Soviet armaments industry.
   He took the helm of the Moscow party organization in November
1987 after his predecessor, maverick politician Boris N. Yeltsin,
was fired in disgrace for criticizing the slow pace of Gorbachev's
reforms.
   One of the most powerful officials in the Communist Party
apparatus, Zaikov has supported the policy of promoting scientific
and technological progress, but has called for limits in the
party's drive for ``glasnost,'' or greater openness.
   This spring, Yeltsin and Zaikov's party apparatus clashed
head-on in the country's first multicandidate elections in seven
decades, with Yeltsin claiming the party was trying to sabotage his
bid to win the Moscow-wide seat in the new Coongress of People's
Deputies.
   Muscovites massively showed their support for Yeltsin, giving
him 89 percent of the vote against the party machine candidate, the
director of a Moscow automobile and truck works.
   A secretary at the party committee in Moscow's Frunze district
rejected a Western reporter's suggestion that Zaikov had been
ousted because of sagging popularity.
   ``Oh no, you can't be more mistaken,'' she said. ``He wasn't
fired. Far from it _ he was promoted.'' A duty officer at city
party headquarters also said Zaikov had received a ``higher
position.''

   A Maryland woman who said she stole $5.5
million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to
give to the poor was indicted today by a federal grand jury in
Baltimore, a court clerk said.
   Marilyn Louise Harrell, who has been dubbed ``Robin HUD,'' was
charged with theft of government property, making false statements
to the federal government, making false statements in connection
with a loan application and aiding and abetting, said the U.S.
District Court clerk in Baltimore.
   The clerk spoke on condition of annoymity.
   The Justice Department planned to announce the indictment
formally later in the day.
   Attempts to reach Harrell's attorney, federal public defender
Anthony Gallagher, were not immediately successful. A receptionist
at his office said Gallagher was in court on an unrelated matter
and not available.
   Prosecutors began presenting evidence to the grand jury not long
after Harrell testified to Congress last June that she withheld the
$5.5 million from HUD while handling the sale of government-owned
property and used some of it to assist charities and the homeless.
   Word of the possible indictment first came Monday when U.S.
Attorney Breckinridge Willcox of Baltimore said he would announce
today a ``major development'' in a HUD case.
   HUD and Justice Department sources, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, had said the announcement would involve the Harrell case
and that prosecutors had asked the grand jury to indict her.
   ``I can't say anything more at this time,'' Willcox said in a
brief telephone conversation Monday evening.
   Meanwhile, a report released Monday by the House Government
Operations Committee said former HUD official June Koch appears to
have repeatedly violated ethics laws by using her government
contacts to help her private business.
   The report urged the Justice Department to investigate Koch, who
was accused of using her influence on HUD officials to benefit the
consulting firm she has headed since leaving HUD two years ago.
   Harrell's testimony to Congress was among the most dramatic
during six months of hearings into allegations of fraud,
mismanagement and political favoritism at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   Two weeks after she testified, HUD seized her house in
Washington's Maryland suburbs as well as several other properties
she said she purchased with HUD money to help various charities and
homeless families.
   ``I in no way justify what I have done as being anything less
than sin,'' she told a House subcommittee in June. ``I do,
regardless of where my life takes me from here, intend to repay in
full all monies taken.''
   Harrell, who was a private escrow agent hired by HUD to handle
the sales of HUD-owned properties, said she was easily able to
withhold money from the department. Several top officials in HUD's
Washington field office, to which she reported, were fired because
of the Harrell case and other alleged mismanagement.
   Harrell is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping
some of the money they were supposed to transfer to HUD.
   When she lost her house in late June, Harrell said she was
moving in with her mother in Fort Washington, Md. Attempts to reach
her Monday were unsuccessful; the mother's telephone number is
unlisted.

<HEAD>Assembly Applauds SWAPO Call for Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Namibia's new assembly
joined in applause Tuesday when the dominant party, which espoused
Marxism for two decades, proposed a democratic framework for the
independence constitution.
   SWAPO, the South-West Africa People's Organization, fought a
23-year war against South African rule and won 41 of the 72
constituent assembly seats earlier this month.
   At least 48 members, a two-thirds majority, must approve the
charter written by the assembly.
   Twenty-one seats are held by the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy in the
predominantly black territory, and the 10 remaining seats are
distributed among five other parties.
   The assembly met in the Tintenpalast, Namibia's seat of
government since German colonial rulers built it in 1910. South
Africa captured the territory, also known as South-West Africa, in
1915, during World War I.
   Hage Geingob, elected chairman of the assembly, told the opening
session: ``The electorate has given us a mandate to hammer out, and
adopt, in a spirit of compromise, a spirit of give-and-take, a
constitution that will lead our people into nationhood.'' Geingob
was in charge of the SWAPO election campaign.
   Members applauded when Theo-Ben Gurirab, who handles foreign
affairs for SWAPO, proposed that the constitution be based on
democratic principles outlined in a 1982 U.N. document setting up
the procedures for Namibia's transition to independence.
   He offered a motion saying the constitution should be the
supreme law of the land, with specific procedures for amendment,
and Namibia should have an independent judiciary and an elected
executive responsible to the legislative branch.
   Guirab said a declaration of rights should include freedom of
movement, speech and association; a free press; the right to life,
personal liberty and property, and freedom from racial, ethnic,
religious or sexual discrimination.
   His motion could not be adopted because the assembly will not
have rules of order until it meets again on Monday.
   SWAPO espoused Marxist principles during most of its history,
and its stand on democratic principles during the campaign was
vague and contradictory.
   Sam Nujoma, president of SWAPO, told the assembly: ``I'm here
with great humility and pride. Pride, because an occasion like this
only happens once in a lifetime. Humility because I, Sam Nujoma,
son of an ordinary citizen, have been honored to be part of the
struggle that brought us here and to lead us to nationhood.''
   As he and other former guerrilla leaders mounted the steps of
the yellow-and-white colonial government building, Erica Beukes,
one of four protesters, screamed that they were ``killers.''
   She and the others belonged to the Parents' Committee, which has
demanded that SWAPO reveal the fates of more than 400 people it
detained in its foreign camps as spies. A U.N. investigation
concluded more than 100 were dead and no information could be
obtained about 350 others.
   Hundreds of swaying, ululating SWAPO supporters surged around
Nujoma, chanting ``Viva!'' as his bodyguards pushed a path through
the crowd.
   The parties have said they hope the constitution will be
completed by early next year and independence can be declared
shortly afterward.
   Martti Ahtisaari, head of the U.N. team monitoring the
transition, attended the assembly's opening session. He has said he
expects Namibia to become independent before the his group's
scheduled departure at the end of March.
   South Africa governed South-West Africa under a League of
Nations mandate. The United Nations revoked it in 1966, but South
Africa refused to leave and the bush war with SWAPO began for
control of the vast, mineral-rich territory and its 1.5 million
people.
   Earlier this year, South Africa agreed to allow independence
under a U.S.-mediated peace accord that also called for withdrawal
of the 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.

<HEAD>Utility Workers Enlisted in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 600 utility workers in 41 counties have
been organized into a network to tell police of possible drug
laboratories.
   Line workers, meter readers, billing clerks and other employees
were trained last month by police to look for signs of clandestine
laboratories that make methamphetamine, or speed.
   ``We're seeing more and more of these labs in rural areas, where
the neighbors are not on top of them to report things like noxious
fumes, noise and fans running all the time,'' said Walter Williams,
training coordinator for the state attorney general's Bureau of
Narcotics and Investigations.
   ``Because rural electric linemen are out there in the
countryside, they do come across things,'' said Tom Hoy, a
spokesman in Washington, D.C., for the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association. ``But this is the first time I know of
where they're being trained or alerted to some kind of drug
surveillance.''
   Police say signs of an illegal drug lab include chemical odors
coming from barns or houses, discarded chemical containers, fans
whirring through the night, unusually high consumption of water or
electricity, extreme fluctuations in power use, and large cash
purchases of land and equipment, especially by new residents.
   Thirteen electricity cooperatives have established ``drug
awareness teams'' as part of a program managed by the attorney
general's office. The cooperatives are non-profit power companies
whose customers are voting members with a voice in how the utility
is run. All serve rural areas, where police patrols are spread thin.
   Rural electric workers ``travel the back roads and are in a
better position to see things that normally go unnoticed,'' said
Joseph Dukick, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Rural Electric
Association, a Harrisburg-based trade group.
   ``We told our people not to investigate. If they see something
suspicious, turn and run in the other direction and contact the
police,'' he said.
   Utility officials said most employees endorsed the program. But
some worried they would be seen as spies by their neighbors or
could become involved with dangerous criminals.
   ``They want to handle it in confidence and keep a low profile.
They don't want to put themselves at risk,'' said Ed Dezich,
manager of the Southwest Central Rural Electric Cooperative.
   The American Civil Liberties Union sees a ``tremendous potential
for abuse'' in the program, said Barbara Wolvovitz, executive
director of the Pittsburgh chapter.
   ``There's nothing wrong with a lineman or anyone else reporting
something suspicious to police,'' she said. ``But if fluctuating
electricity use is the sole basis for going to court to get a
warrant, then we have a problem with that. There are many innocent
reasons for a fluctuation to occur.''
   Wolvovitz said the ACLU may monitor the program.
   Hoy, whose association represents 1,000 rural electric systems
in 46 states and 25 million rural customers, said: ``We are
developing a national program to identify drug problems in rural
areas and what role rural electrics can play in solving the growing
drug problem in rural America. We're beginning to talk to our
members now ... to see how we can coordinate this.''

   In this small community where Ernest and
Regina Twigg live, friends understand but strangers question why
the parents of seven persevered until they proved a 10-year-old
stranger was their daughter.
   ``The folks who know us, our friends, have been real supportive.
Some of the people who work with me for Amtrak have called to say,
`We're with you,''' Twigg said.
   ``But others wonder why we're pursuing this, why we couldn't
just let it drop. I guess you'd have to be a parent to know why,''
he said from the Amtrak station where he's a ticket agent.
   Twigg went back to work Monday, after lawyers went public with
the news that genetic tests showed two families had raised the
other's child. The Twiggs say their real daughter is Kimberly Mays
of Sarasota who was switched in a hospital nursery with the child
they took home a decade ago. That child, Arlena, died last year of
heart disease.
   The girls were born just days apart at Hardee Memorial Hospital
in the rural central Floriday city of Wauchula in the fall of 1978.
   Test results released Sunday found a 99.9 percent chance that
Kimberly Mays is actually a Twigg, and a 98.9 percent chance that
Arlena Twigg was the daughter of Robert Mays and his wife, Barbara,
who died of cancer in 1981.
   Mays has not commented since the test results were released. He
is expected to attend a news conference at his attorney's office in
Sarasota on Wednesday.
   Lee Salk, a Cornell University Medical College professor of
psychology, said the revelation triggers a common fear.
   ``This affects us all,'' he said. ``It brings out the `Were we
switched?' fear. I imagine it will kick up anxiety in other
children.''
   Salk was one of seven child psychologists or psychiatrists asked
by Mays' attorney to state what effect the Twiggs' effort to
ascertain biological parenthood would have on Kimberly. In 1988,
all seven said that pursuing the case would be harmful to the
10-year-old.
   Some or all of them may be called by the court to help recommend
a visitation plan between the Twiggs and Kimberly. The Twiggs
agreed not to seek custody of Kimberly in an agreement with Mays
that allowed the genetic testing.
   The likely effects psychologists cited range from shattering the
security of Kimberly's relationship with the man who reared her, to
causing depression, anxiety, anger or confusion and a sense of loss.
   Salk expressed dismay Monday that the search was pursued.
   The Twiggs sued Hardee Memorial in September in U.S. District
Court in Tampa. Mays' attorney, Arthur Ginsburg, said he would
recommend that Mays also consider suing.
   The Twiggs' lawsuit alleges a baby swap resulted from medical
malpractice, neglect or deliberate acts and asks a jury to decide.
   Hardee Memorial has asked that the lawsuit be dismissed on
technical grounds.
   The hospital's lawyer, Janet Adams, said Florida's statute of
limitations requires patients to file malpractice claims within
four years. Since the alleged swap occurred in 1978, she said, it's
too late.
   But another attorney for the Twiggs, Bill Post, said the ``clock
did not start ticking'' until the Twiggs knew that Arlena was not
their child.

   President Bush doesn't have to worry about a
dearth of good books to curl up with in front of the fireplace this
winter.
   Esquire magazine has shipped off 34 books picked for the
president by the 1989 Esquire Register Honorees.
   There's something for every mood, from the Bible, picked by
Oprah Winfrey, to the Robert Mapplethorpe catalog from the art show
that touched off a political firestorm over government funding of
art.
   Actor Billy Crystal picked Erich Segal's ``Love Story,'' because
``Bush could get out of it how much they cared for each other. It's
so sad that they're not together. Plus, it's short, he can get
right back to business.''
   Bush is getting a variety of historical tomes, including
``Roots,'' by Alex Haley, picked by Chicago Bulls star Michael
Jordan, and ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' courtesy of
filmmaker Spike Lee.
   Randy Shilts' chronicle of the AIDS crisis, ``And the Band
Played On,'' was picked by two of the honorees.
   W. Keith Hefner, founder and executive director of the
non-profit Youth Communication-New York Center, named the newsroom
classic, ``The Elements of Style,'' by Strunk and White.
   ``I'd like him to correct his broken syntax,'' Hefner said.
   If he's thinking about getting a cat to curl with him by the
fire, he can thank country music star Lyle Lovett for ``You and
Your Cat,'' by David Taylor.
   ``I got this book when I first got my cat,'' Lovett said. ``I'd
never had a cat, didn't know anything about it. In spite of my
total inexperience, the cat's fine because of this book.''
   Should nothing in the entire pile suit his taste, however, he
can look forward to receiving one more.
   Actress Michelle Pfeiffer's response to Esquire's question was:
``Let me think about that and I'll get back to you.''

<HEAD>First Televised Commons Debate Focuses on Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Commons-TV, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, waging her first
televised parliamentary battle Tuesday, clashed bitterly with the
opposition over Britain's place in Europe.
   Inflation, high interest rates and the deficit also played
starring roles in the live telecast on three British networks.
   Mrs. Thatcher again attacked the European Economic Community's
plans for a social charter harmonizing workers' rights in Britain
and the 11 other member states.
   ``Instead of encouraging the creation of new jobs, it would add
to industry's costs and thereby price people out of work,'' she
said in the debate, which kicked off the year's legislative program
and marked the first time the House of Commons has been televised.
   The charter would export jobs to more competitive countries, she
said.
   ``We cannot accept a text which would completely reverse the
very policies which have been responsible for our economic success
over the past 10 years.
   ``What we could accept is a much more general declaration which
... respects the right of each member state to follow its own
social policies.''
   ``The parts (of the charter) we are firmly in favor of are those
parts which will lead to the creation of new jobs and will not
oppose competition and competitive costs,'' she said.
   But she opposed the parts that would put ``greater burdens on
industry and reduce our competitiveness.''
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labor Party opposition, chastised
Mrs. Thatcher for drawing a dichotomy between reform in Eastern
Europe and the EEC's moves toward greater unity.
   ``For you to try to equate the efforts of any of the democracies
in Western Europe with the system in the East that is collapsing
under the weight of its own inefficiences and injustice, is
absurd,'' he said.
   ``You should change your attitude, as it helps no one, least of
all your country. Before 1939, there were many Europes, since then,
there have been two Europes bitterly divided.
   ``Now there is the beginning of a possibility that there will be
one Europe, a continent with borders, but without barriers.''
   He ridiculed Mrs. Thatcher's claim that Britain's economy was
``fundamentally strong.''
   ``When I hear that claim, I have to ask why, if there is such an
abundance of confidence, we in Britain have to pay 15 percent
interest rates in order to buy the confidence.
   ``As for underlying strength, just look at our economy. In 10
oil-rich years of this government, we have seen the economy
suffering fron chronic traffic congestion, delay and danger as a
result of systematic and sustained under-funding.''
   Mrs. Thatcher welcomed the changes in Eastern Europe and
promised aid, but warned against dropping Britain's military guard.
   ``Times of great change are times of great uncertainty, even
danger.
   ``We have to be prepared for any threat, however unexpected. As
events demonstrate ever more conclusively, we are winning the
battle of ideas. We must make sure that we don't subsequently lose
the peace,'' she said.
   Rebutting Kinnock's criticisms, she said the present 7.3 percent
inflation rate was lower than anything achieved by Labor between
1974 and 1979, when it was last in power.
   ``But a rate which was a cause for celebration for them ... is a
cause of concern for us, because it is far too high by our
standards,'' she said. ``The absolute priority is to get inflation
down. But it is not only Government policy that will determine the
prospects for growth and jobs. They depend on how well businesses
keep their costs down.''
   She said her government's legislative program was aimed at
enlarging opportunity and enhancing the quality of life.
   ``The old class-based order is being replaced by one based on
merit, ability and effort. This is the new Britain. The Britain for
the 1990s,'' she said.

   A 10-year-old boy suffering from a rare brain

   Craig Shergold's mountain of 1,256,266 get-well cards tops the
previous record of 1,000,265 cards held by another English boy,
12-year-old Mario Morby.
   A spokeswoman at Guinness Publishing Ltd. said Craig received an
official certificate and his record will be included in the next
edition of the book, ``The Guinness Book of Records 1991.''
   Craig said in an interview from his home in Carshalton, south
London, that he was confident he would make it into the record
books when his attempt began Sept. 24.
   Marion Shergold said the attempt to break the world record began
as a way to cheer up her son after he was too sick to meet Princess
Diana.
   ``He was really feeling low after that, so we said, `Let's go
for the Guinness Book of Records,''' she said.
   Mrs. Shergold said an emergency operation in January removed
three-quarters of her son's tumor.
   The cancer spread to Craig's spinal cord, but doctors believe
they have successfully stemmed the disease with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, Mrs. Shergold said.
   ``We don't know about the tumor on the brain so we take one day
at a time,'' she said. ``The cards have been the best medicine in
the world.''
   If the boy's health continues to improve, Mrs. Shergold said she
and her husband, Ernie, and their other son, who is 23, are
planning to take Craig to Disneyworld in February.
   Craig, who is bald from the cancer treatments, said all of the
publicity about the card doesn't bother him, although he gets tired.
   The appeal began by word of mouth and then turned to fax
machines. Notices were sent to companies requesting get-well cards
and for the fax to be sent on to two more companies. The faxes
circulated throughout Britain before reaching the Middle East and
North America.
   J.P. McDougall and Co., a northern England decorators supply
company, participated in the record attempt by alerting their 100
depots. The company received 30,000 cards, which were packed in
bags and sent by courier to Craig.
   ``It was slow at first, and then they just started flooding
in,'' said Elsie Riley, who counted the pile of cards sent to
McDougall's mail room. ``Some people sent presents and chocolates.
It was really heartening.''
   The collection officially ended Nov. 19, but cards continue to
arrive from all over the world. Mrs. Shergold appealed to
well-wishers to stop sending cards.
   One of Craig's favorites came from Capt. Al Haynes, the pilot
credited with saving the lives of 184 of the 296 passengers on
board the United Airlines DC-10 which crashed on July 19 in Sioux
City, Iowa.
   ``For three months I've been receiving cards from all over the
world from people who've cared. It's meant a great deal to me,''
Haynes wrote in the letter, which included some pilot wings.
   Mrs. Shergold said their local post office had been very helpful.
   ``They've taken over a warehouse free of charge for us and when
we've opened and read all of the cards we put them in bags of
2,000,'' Mrs. Shergold said.

   President Bush on Tuesday signed a $157
billion labor, health and education appropropriations bill shorn of
language that would have liberalized Medicaid financing for
abortions.
   Bush had vetoed an earlier version of the bill in a battle with
Congress over abortion financing.
   In a statement, the president praised Congress for bowing to his
insistence that Medicaid fund abortions only to save the life of
the mother.
   The bill originally would have allowed Medicaid to pay for
abortions for poor women who had been raped or were the victims of
incest. Bush said the provision ``would have deprived innocent,
unborn children of the most basic civil right, the right to life.''
   He said the massive spending bill for the departments of Labor,
Education and Health and Human Services, plus related agencies,
will finance ``some of the nation's most important programs _
programs that help the needy, the unemployed, the sick and the
infirm, and programs that provide for the education of American
children.''
   He noted that the legislation includes nearly $1.6 billion to
combat the deadly AIDS virus and $5.4 billion for remedial
education for disadvantaged students.
   Bush, surrounded by 13 children, also signed a proclamation
declaring this National Adoption Week.
   Bush, who has sought to spur adoption as an alternative to
abortion, said each of the 50,000 children adopted in the United
States a year repay their new families a hundredfold.
   But he said thousands more children still wait to be adopted,
many of them with special needs.
   Bush recently asked Congress to pass legislation giving parents
a $3,000 tax deduction to help cover the costs of adopting children
with disabilities or other special needs.
   He shook hands and asked the names of each child, recognizing at
least one boy from an earlier adoption ceremony, then expressed
regret that first dog Millie was not allowed into the ceremonial
rooms.
   Mrs. Bush, putting her husband's thought into action, took care
of that.
   ``Pretty cute kids, I'll tell you,'' said the first lady. She
instructed Tim McBride, the president's personal aide, to let the
dog in, and in a flash Millie ran into the Roosevelt Room.
   The dog raced in, ran around the kids and raced out. Mrs. Bush
called her back and hoisted her up for a girl in a wheelchair to
pet.
   ``That's all for Millie. Goodbye!'' said Mrs. Bush, as the pet
trotted off.

<TEXT>
   Children, many clutching their parents'
hands, returned Tuesday to their storm-damaged school where seven
classmates died last week, as tornado-stricken Coldenham continued
to heal with unexpected help.
   The morning mail was filled with donations again Tuesday at the
Coldenham Fire Department. Donors, some anonymous, have given
$61,000 to help families after the tornado, which also injured 18
at the school, said Bud Black, assistant fire chief.
   Children have walked into the firehouse with coffee cans filled
with change and one man anonymously donated about $5,000 in
quarters, Black said. All firefighters know was that the man's
vehicle had New Jersey license plates, he said.
   ``It's great,'' he said. ``It's something a little bit to the
positive side.''
   Classes were held at East Coldenham Elementary School for the
first time since the tornado hit Thursday at lunchtime and blew in
the glass and concrete cafeteria wall. Parents brought children in
for counseling Monday to make the first day back less jarring.
   With a cold northwest wind shaking a flagpole and violently
flapping the flag, few parents and children paused in front of the
boarded-up cafeteria wall. Flowers remained piled against the wood
that has replaced shattered glass and bricks.
   The school is trying to get back to something like normal
operations before Thanksgiving, said Robert Schoonmaker, assistant
superintendent for the Valley Central school district.
   Rooms were set aside at the school for children and adults to
grieve and counselors remained on hand, officials said. Students
went back to school Monday at the district's other six schools.
   Coldenham firefighters have taken toy fire engines and other
playthings to children still hospitalized, Black said. Eleven are
still in the hospital, with two in criltical condition and one
fair. The rest were in good or satisfactory conditon Tuesday.
   ``We've visited every child and brought them gifts and it is as
much for our therapy as theirs,'' he said.
   Firefighters began getting donations even before they thought to
set up a memorial fund, Black said. A committee was hurriedly set
up to allocate the money, which will be used partly for hospital
and funeral fees for the stricken families, he said. The last five
funerals were Monday.
   The fund also will be used to pay expenses for Rosalie Sbordone,
the eighth East Coldenham student to die in the last week. Sbordone
died Monday from injuries suffered in an auto accident Sunday a few
hundred yards from the school's entrance.
   Her parents, Neil and Virginia Sbordone, have donated the
5-year-old girl's organs for transplant.
   ``She's going to live on in someone else,'' Virginia Sbordone
said. ``Other children are going to live because of her. Some other
grieving family is going to have joy because of her.''

<TEXT>
   A Texas man being sought in the
abduction of his two young sons was arraigned on murder charges
Tuesday after he walked into a county jail and told a receptionist
he had killed the boys.
   Roy Irwin Abbott Sr., 52, of Denton, Texas, was ordered held
pending a bail hearing Nov. 29. No plea was entered.
   According to affidavit by state police Detective William Gomane,
Abbott said at the York County Jail: ``I need to see a police
officer. I've killed my kids.''
   Abbott told police he used a 12-gauge shotgun to kill the boys
Monday and left the weapon in the back of his car, Gomane said.
Authorities said the shotgun was recovered.
   Authorities found the boys' bodies, both with gunshot wounds, on
a dirt road in a wooded area near Silver Lake in Shapleigh, Maine,
state police said.
   Abbott, a Maine native, and the boys apparently had been staying
without permission at a Silver Lake cottage owned by Abbott's
brother, Benjamin Abbott, of Portsmouth, N.H., said state police
Sgt. Michael Harriman.
   Abbott made no comments to reporters as he entered the
courthouse.
   His court-appointed lawyer, Stephen J. Schwartz of Portland, had
little to say. ``I haven't even had the opportunity to discuss the
full set of facts with my client,'' he said.
   On Sept. 1, Abbott's divorce from Maria Louisa Abbott, 40, of
Denton, became final and he took custody of his sons for the Labor
Day weekend, Denton Police Capt. Bill Cummings said. Abbott was
supposed to return the boys on Sept. 4 but did not.
   Their mother contacted police the next day; a kidnapping warrant
was issued on Oct. 16.
   Abbott told police he had planned to turn himself in on the
Texas charge Monday but then shot his sons when they began crying
and did not want to go home, officers said.
   ``He started into town to turn himself in. They started crying,
and he shot them,'' Cummings said.
   Spokesman Stephen McCausland of the Maine Department of Public
Safety identified the older boy as Roy Irwin Abbott Jr., 6. Maine
officials identified the younger boy as Ronney Abbott, 4, but Texas
authorities identified the younger boy as Rooney Abbott. Neither
agency was able to explain the discrepancy Tuesday.
   Autopsies Tuesday revealed that the boys died of gunshot wounds
to the head and chest, Harriman said, adding that each boy was shot
twice at close range.
   Authorities said they believe Abbott came to the Portsmouth area
around Sept. 4 and that he worked briefly at a department store
there before taking the boys to Canaan, Maine.
   Abbott enrolled the older boy in Canaan Christian School in late
October for about two weeks, then moved to Yarmouth where he worked
at a dry cleaning business from Nov. 6 to Nov. 8, Harriman said.
   The sergeant said authorities searched for Abbott in Augusta,
Eliot, Kittery and Portsmouth. ``Each time we checked these
locations, there was another move on his part, indicating he was
aware he was being hunted.''
   Cummings said Texas authorities would likely wait for Maine
officials to finish legal proceedings before seeking an extradition
on kidnapping charges.

   Here is the legal status of key figures in the
Iran-Contra affair:
   _Oliver North, former National Security Council aide, found
guilty at a jury trial May 4 of three felonies _ aiding and
abetting the obstruction of Congress, destroying official documents
and accepting an illegal gratuity _ and sentenced to two years
probation, fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service. He is appealing the conviction, the fine and
probation while serving the community service in an anti-drug
program.
   _Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, pleaded
guilty to four misdemeanors of withholding information from
Congress by denying that the NSC staff was soliciting support for
the Contras' military activities and helping move supplies to the
rebels and denying that he knew anything about other countries'
financing of the Contras.
   _Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded
guilty Nov. 8 to lying to congressional investigators when he said
he wasn't aware of any money that went to the benefit of North from
the maze of companies known as the Enterprise which Secord had used
in the Iran-Contra affair.
   _Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, pleaded guilty to using his non-profit
National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty to raise more
than $2 million to buy weapons for the Nicaraguan rebels. Sentenced
to two years probation for conspiring to defraud the Treasury of
taxes due on the money raised with North's assistance.
   _Richard Miller, head of a Washington public relations firm who
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service of taxes on contributions used to supply military aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras. Sentenced to two years probation.
   _John Poindexter, facing trial Jan. 22, accused of conspiracy,
two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements in connection with Reagan administration assistance to
the Contras and a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
Has issued subpoena for records and testimony of former President
Reagan.
   _Albert Hakim, a middleman in the affair, pleaded guilty Tuesday
to a misdemeanor of aiding and abetting in supplementing North's
income by paying for a security fence at North's home. Hakim will
be sentenced Feb. 1 and could face up to a year in prison. Also, a
company he set up, Lake Resources, pleadedguilty to theft of
government property, a felony that could carry a fine of up to
$500,000.

<HEAD>Rival Parties Agree on Interim Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Greece's three main parties
reached agreement Tuesday for an all-party, interim government to
end the stalemate that followed inconclusive elections on Nov. 5.
   ``The three parties agreed to support a government whose life
term will last until mid-April,'' conservative leader Constantine
Mitsotakis told a news conference.
   The decision to hold general elections in April follows four
rounds of talks between conservative, socialist and communist
leaders with President Christos Sartzetakis.
   Mitsotakis said the interim administration will be headed by
Xenophon Zolotas, an economist and former governor of the Bank of
Greece. Zolotas is not a member of Parliament.
   The government will include members of all parties and also
non-political personalities, Mitsotakis said, but composition of
the Cabinet has not been decided.
   He said the administration's first tasks will be to deal with
economic problems and negotiations with the United States on
whether to renew an agreement for U.S. bases in Greece.
   In Washington, the State Department said the United States looks
forward to working with the new government and will raise the
question of the status of the U.S. bases once a Cabinet is formed.
   It issued a statement saying, ``We believe it is in the interest
of both countries to continue a strong bilateral security
relationship. We will look for a mutually satisfactory way to do
so.''
   Talks between the party leaders had been deadlocked over a
demand by former socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou that the
electoral system be changed.
   His proposed change involving the proportional representation
system would have made it even more difficult for any party to win
a majority in the 300-member unicameral Parliament. Under the
present system if one party receives at least 47 percent of the
vote it can govern alone.
   Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy Party won 46 percent of the vote
and 148 parliamentary seats in November, rejected the proposal. He
said the April elections will be conducted under the present
electoral system.''
   Papandreou governed for eight years until the formation of a
conservative-communist alliance in June after elections that also
failed to give any party a majority.
   His party won 128 seats in November and the communist-led
Coalition of the Left and Progress led by Harilaos Florakis won 21.
Two seats went to independents and one to an environmentalist.
   Zolotas, 85, headed the nation's central bank for almost 20
years while conservatives were in power.
   The premier-designate is not a member of any political party and
has never run for Parliament.
   Zolotas served as Bank of Greece governor from 1955-67 and from
1974-81. He acquired a reputation as a pragmatist for maintaining
tight economic policies to offset Greece's trade deficit.
   A socialist party official who was close to the negotiations
that produced the compromise agreement said Zolotas was proposed by
Mitsotakis and ``accepted without any objections.''

   White House Budget Director Richard Darman
said he hopes Tuesday's deficit reduction agreement means more
cooperation than confrontation with Congress next year on budget
issues.
   Darman said the deficit cutting package was made possible by
President Bush's insistence that he was willing to accept
across-the-board spending cuts rather than tolerate a 1990 budget
which met the Gramm-Rudman deficit targets through accounting
gimmicks.
   The $14.7 billion deficit cutting package was agreed to in
post-midnight negotiations as members of Congress rushed to
complete their work before the Thanksgiving holidays.
   Darman said the measure was ``far better than anyone thought
likely'' on Nov. 2 when Bush issued his ultimatum that he wanted to
see at least $14 billion in real deficit reductions or he was
prepared to live with across-the-board spending cuts.
   The director of the Office of Management and Budget, however,
warned members of Congress not to try to make changes in the
agreement in passing the necessary implementing legislation. He
said any such changes could still prompt a presidential veto.
   ``If they do not follow the agreement, then there will not be a
deal,'' Darman said in a meeting with reporters.
   The deficit-reduction package, Darman said, should get Congress
and the administration back to where they were last spring when
both sides reached a much-heralded budget pact. That agreement
dissolved into bitter partisan fighting over Bush's efforts to
slash capital gains tax rates.
   ``This can get us back on a path of bipartisanship and put this
recent period of partisan debate behind us,'' Darman said, adding
that the challenge of meeting the deficit-reduction target of $64
billion in 1991 was sizable.
   The administration is preparing its 1991 budget to be submitted
in January, but Darman turned aside questions about what will be in
that package.
   He did say the administration would be proposing cuts in
entitlement programs to meet the deficit targets.
   He also said that he would consider increases in alcohol and
tobacco taxes among the revenue increases that would be prohibited
under the president's no-new taxes campaign pledge. But he added
that he doesn't drink or smoke and said, ``I don't believe either
of those should be encouraged.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that a Bush
administration task force is considering proposals to raise the
federal tax on tobacco and liquor and impose new taxes on polluters
and use the revenues raised to underwrite the cost to the
government of offering individuals new tax breaks to encourage
savings.
   Darman said he believed that the budget deficit, which totaled
$152.1 billion in the fiscal year which ended on Sept. 30, had now
been stabilized at a sustainable level withthe new deficit cutting
agreement for the current fiscal year.
   ``There isn't the sense of erosion or lack of control that I had
in the 1980s,'' Darman said, referring to his years of service in
the Reagan administration. The budget deficit hit a record of
$221.1 billion in 1986.

   A senior member of the House Armed Services
Committee said Tuesday that Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
has executed ``probably more than 100'' officers and troops since a
failed Oct. 3 coup.
   ``As a result, there cannot be a chivalrous coup d'etat in the
future. The next batch of coup plotters won't be interested in
handing Noriega over to us or dispatching him into exile,'' said
Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.
   ``Noriega has changed the ground rules. So the next coup will be
bloody.''
   The purge, Skelton said, amounts to 3 percent of the men in the
Panamanian Defense Force.
   Skelton's comments came a day after his Defense Policy Panel
received a closed-door, top-secret briefing from Gen. Maxwell
Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, based in Panama.
   Skelton said Noriega had killed ``more than 70 and probably more
than 100 officers and men of the Panama Defense Force.''
   ``Before October, coups in Panama were essentially bloodless. If
you lost a coup, you lost your job _ but not your life. Noriega has
changed all that,'' Skelton said in a statement.
   The result is that any new coup attempt, ``if successful, will
do little that we want except eliminate Noriega, which will
probably happen in a manner we do not wish to be associated with,''
Skelton said.
   ``Whoever wins lives, and whoever loses will die. That's the
game we're in now,'' he said.
   Intelligence sources have said that, in the wake of the failed
coup, the Central Intelligence Agency has received congressional
clearance for a new covert plan that would spend up to $3 million
to depose Noriega. The plan would permit aiding coup plotters, even
if violence were likely, as long as the plot did not include plans
for assassination.
   A longstanding executive order bars U.S. operatives from
participating in any plot to assassinate a foreign leader.
   Skelton said he was satisfied that the likelihood Noriega could
die in a later coup does not necessarily represent an impediment to
U.S. involvement.
   ``A death involved in a coup is different from an out-and-out
assassination attempt,'' he said.
   Noriega's purge has left a ``concentration of thugs'' in the
PDF, which lessens the chances that any new coup would lead to a
restoration of democracy and elimination of drug trafficking and
money laundering, Skelton said.
   The coup attempt occurred during Thurman's first week as the new
chief of Southcom, and Skelton was among the harshest congressional
critics of U.S. failure to give full support to the rebels led by
Maj. Moises Giroldi.
   But after Thurman's briefing, Skelton said it was clear that the
coup attempt was flawed because it was based on the ``irrational
premise'' that Noriega would agree to retire to his farm in Panama,
and because the rebels wouldn't turn Noriega over to U.S.
authorities, would not have restored democracy and probably would
have continued Noriega's drug operations.
   At the Pentagon, a spokeswoman, Maj. Kathy Wood, said security
has been tightened at U.S. defense sites in Panama because of bomb
threats.
   Wood said that the first such threat was made about a week ago
and that the new security steps have been in effect for nearly a
week's time.
   ``It means that they are inspecting cars more carefully, and
that some parking lots have been closed if they are within 75
meters of buildings,'' Wood said.
   U.S. personnel are acting under personnel movement limitations
that require them to keep others advised of their movements, to
exercise caution and to avoid any known trouble areas, Wood said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Refiles Felony Assault Charge Against `Diff'rent Strokes'
Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A felony assault charge was refiled Tuesday
against former child television star Todd Bridges, who was
acquitted by a jury earlier this month of more serious charges in
the shooting of a drug dealer.
   Bridges, who faces up to six years in prison if convicted,
pleaded innocent to assault with a firearm and remained free on
$25,000 bail pending a Jan. 25 hearing, said Mike Botula of the
district attorney's office.
   Jurors found Bridges innocent Nov. 7 of attempted murder and the
lesser charge of attempted voluntary manslaughter. Two days later,
the panel announced it was deadlocked 8-4 in favor of acquitting
him on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
   The former member of the cast of the series ``Diff'rent
Strokes'' was originally charged with shooting eight bullets into
Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay and slashing his throat during a Feb. 2
scuffle in a south-central Los Angeles ``crack'' house where
cocaine was being peddled.
   Clay, 25, survived the attack and testified Bridges was ``based
out'' from freebasing or smoking cocaine when the shooting
occurred. ``He looked like his eyes were about to jump out of his
head,'' Clay said.
   Clay described himself as a bodyguard for the owner of the house
where Bridges was living and said Bridges was taking weapons from
the house and selling them.
   Defense attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. maintained throughout
the trial that Bridges shot Clay in self-defense.
   Bridges, 24, who for eight years played actor Gary Coleman's
brother Willis on ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' testified he became
depressed and turned to drugs after the situation comedy was
canceled in 1986.
   On Nov. 13, Harvie Eugene Duckett, 31, who testified that he
helped Bridges attack Clay, was placed on three years' probation as
part of a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official East German newspaper called
Communist Party chief Egon Krenz a secret member of the old guard
Tuesday, less than a month before a party congress that is expected
to make leadership changes.
   Calls for Germany reunification by protesters in Leipzig added
still another dimension to an already volatile and complicated
political situation.
   Premier Hans Modrow's new government said it was planning
``unpopular measures'' to curb black-market currency trading, which
has flourished since the borders with West Germany were opened Nov.
9.
   A statement by Modrow to workers at a Berlin factory, as
reported by the official news agency ADN, did not make clear
whether there would be an attempt to reduce the number of East
Germans traveling to the West. More than 6 million have visited
West Berlin or West Germany.
   ``The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) cannot become a
country of currency speculators,'' Modrow said at the factory.
   State television said later the new measures were customs
controls to be revealed after a government meeting Thursday. The
flood of visitors to the West has taken a huge amount of money out
of the country, adding to East Germany's economic problems.
   In Bonn, the West German government said East Germany had
rejected the idea of a joint fund to provide citizens with money
for travel to the West.
   Although East Germans now enjoy freedom of travel unthinkable
less than a year ago, and have been promised free elections,
opposition leaders say that's not enough.
   Increasingly, the criticism has been aimed at Krenz, in part
because 77-year-old Erich Honecker, the man he replaced Oct. 18,
had been his mentor.
   Krenz, 52, has been dogged by a debate over whether he averted a
potential massacre earlier in October by reversing Honecker's
orders to Leipzig police to shoot pro-democracy protesters if
necessary.
   Supporters say he did. Detractors say he reversed the orders
only after being persuated by local party officials and church
leaders.
   His support for China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
in June has been another obstacle in Krenz's effort to win over a
distrustful people. There also have been allegations that he took
part in massive election fraud.
   As Parliament weighs possible criminal charges against Honecker
and other members of his inner circle, reform groups emphasize
Krenz was part of that group. His promises of reform, often
expressed in careful generalities, have done little to change that
attitude.
   Tuesday's editions of the official daily National-Zeitung
reminded its readers the new party chief belonged to the
``leadership body that is now in the cross-fire of criticism.''
   ``Egon Krenz cannot make up lost ground'' unless he answers the
criticisms, it said in a commentary. ``The time of glasnost demands
honesty from everyone.''
   State-run newspapers, which once hewed strictly to the party
leadership's line, have reported much more freely in recent weeks,
but the National-Zeitung's criticism of Krenz was the harshest to
date. ADN distributed the commentary after its publication.
   The conservative, mass-circulation West German newspaper Bild
said Krenz might be ousted in four weeks, which roughly coincides
with the party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17.
   Krenz has acknowledged that possibility. He told state TV over
the weekend: ``Naturally, I want to fight for the changes we've
managed so far, but if the party is of another opinion, then they
should find another general secretary.''
   A major question is whether a former model of party loyalty can
lead East Germany through a crisis rooted in the flight of 275,000
people from a nation of 16.5 million and the commitment to reform
of millions who stayed home.
   Opposition groups previously had expressed indifference, even
opposition, to calls from Bonn for German reunification, but some
of that changed Monday night when protesters in Leipzig called out,
``We are one people!'' and ``Germany a united fatherland!''
   Whether that represents a major shift in position or not, West
Germans seized on the chants as growing support for a single German
state.
   ``In the German Democratic Republic, the calls for a
reunification are growing ever louder,'' said Volker Ruehe, general
secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party, the Christian
Democrats. ``That's what the demonstration of hundreds of thousands
of people showed on Monday evening in Leipzig.''

<TEXT>
   THE SEATS _ The winners of the elections will enter the Lok
Sabha or House of the People, the decision-making lower house of
Parliament. The house has 545 members, of whom two are nominated.
Elections are not being held for 14 seats in the northeastern state
of Assam because voters' lists have not been completed. But there

4,000 independents. Candidates are also from eight national
parties, 33 state parties and 251 other parties. The Congress Party
of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is fielding 509 candidates. The
National Front, an opposition coalition, is up for 314 seats. In
most constituencies, the front has agreed not to oppose candidates
of the the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, which is fielding 226

<HEAD>Psychologists Who Talked about Dukakis May Face Censure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE SCHOROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four psychologists who speculated publicly about
why Kitty Dukakis drank rubbing alcohol have been chastised by a
state licensing board which said they may have violated ethical
principles.
   The State Board of Registration of Psychologists last week sent
letters to the psychologists criticizing them for comments
published Nov. 10 in The Boston Globe, the newspaper said Tuesday.
   The Globe's article came after Mrs. Dukakis, a recovering
alcoholic who is the wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was
hospitalized for drinking rubbing alcohol.
   The article suggested that Mrs. Dukakis broke down in part
because she was carrying all the emotional burdens of the Dukakis
marriage. It quoted psychologist David Kantor as recommending the
governor resign to give the couple the privacy they need to address
their personal problems.
   If the board files a complaint following a preliminary inquiry,
which is under way, the psychologists could be censured or lose
their licenses, the Globe said.
   Dr. Jessica Daniels, chairwoman of the board, would only say
Tuesday that the letters were letters of inquiry. She would not say
whether an investigation was under way.
   The letters said the psychologists may have violated six ethical
principles, the Globe said.
   One of the psychologists, Caroline Maltas, told The Associated
Press she was misquoted and had protested to the Globe.
   The Globe said Maltas, Kantor and psychologist Barry Dym said
they believed they were misquoted, misrepresented or quoted out of
context in the Nov. 10 article, the Globe said. The fourth
psychologist, Esther Shapiro, would not say whd a letter from the
board but would not say whether she was quoted accurately.
   Maltas, co-director of the McLean Institute for Couples and
Families in suburban Belmont, said the board's action could damage
her 16-year psychology practice.
   ``I give these kinds of interviews all the time. I consider it
my professional responsibility to educate the public,'' Maltas told
the AP.
   ``I'm going to be unbelievably careful about who I talk to in
the future,'' she said.
   Shapiro, Dym and Kantor did not return telephone calls Tuesday
seeking comment.
   The order initiating the inquiry did not come from the governor,
said Andrew Dreyfus, a spokesman for the Executive Office of
Consumer Affairs, which oversees all the state's independent
licensing boards.
   ``No one in this office, the governor's office or the director
of the Division of Registration's office had any prior knowledge''
of the inquiry, Dreyfus said.
   Board member Herbert J. Hoffman said the inquiry was prompted by
the Globe article, which appeared the same day as a board meeting.
After a ``full and lengthy discussion, there was a consensus'' to
contact the psychologists about their comments, he said.
   Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy said the newspaper stands by
the article, and defended the practice of reporters asking experts
about current events even though they are not directly involved.
   ``We report by analogy all the time,'' he said. ``If a major
political figure has heart bypass surgery ... certainly a
reasonable approach is to go to doctors and ask how the procedure
works.''
   Under American Psychiatric Association guidelines, mental-health
professionals can comment on psychological problems if they add the
disclaimer that they are talking generally and not about a specific
person, said Dr. Bernard Katz, chief of the Human Resource
Institution in Brookline.
   Maltas said she was aware of the guidelines, and had restricted
her comments to general issues.
   In addition to questions about professional ethics, the board's
inquiry also raises free-speech issues, said Floyd Abrams, a
prominent First Amendment attorney.
   Abrams said the board's actions give the appearance that the
state is trying to quash psychological speculation about the
governor's wife, making people think twice before talking to
reporters.
   ``In a situation like this, where the governor and his family
are under intense public scrutiny, it's particularly important that
state agencies not become involved in making any threats to those
who have been a part of the process,'' Abrams said.

<HEAD>House Passes Anti-Drug Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved a compromise
$240 million anti-drug bill that includes new military aid for the
three Andean countries that are the major source of cocaine flowing
into the United States.
   The bill was approved on a voice vote and sent to the Senate,
which was expected to approve it and send it to the White House
before adjourning for the year.
   A centerpiece of the measure was $125 million in military aid _
including weapons and police training _ to Bolivia, Colombia and
Peru for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The aid is intended for
units organized specifically for narcotics control, and can be used
so long as police forces do not commit gross human rights
violations.
   Another major feature was authorization of $115 million for
operations of international narcotics control programs through the
State Department. It continued the requirement that countries be
certified as cooperating fully with U.S. anti-drug efforts before
receiving aid.
   Under the bill, U.S. officials may help in training foreign
anti-drug personnel and may accompany them on forays but are barred
from direct involvement in arrests in foreign countries.
   House and Senate negotiators, at the insistence of Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., dropped from the bill authority to use some money
for non-Andean countries that are major drug transit points. That
meant that $2.5 million in weaponry and $1 million in police
training would be lost to Mexico, Ecuador, Paraguay, Brazil,
Jamaica and the Bahamas.
   Another change gave more flexibility to the administration to
reward new drug eradication or interdiction efforts in Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia, by waiving repayment of official debts owed
to the U.S. government.

<HEAD>Former Defense Adviser Says Massive Budget Cuts Possible</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former adviser to two secretaries of defense
says the United States could safely trim defense spending by $145
billion over 10 years and should take such action as part of a
``revolution in military affairs.''
   In a 100-page paper to be published next month by the Brookings
Institution, William H. Kaufmann outlines cuts that would reduce
the Pentagon's current budget of $305 billion to $160 billion by
1999. He says the cumulative reductions would add up to $500
billion in savings.
   ``A revolution in military affairs could be in the making at
least in part because of the economic distress in the USSR and the
changes in Soviet leadership,'' Kaufmann, a Harvard University
lecturer and Pentagon veteran, writes.
   ``The revolution will not progress much further without
initiatives and cooperation by the United States,'' he said.
   Kaufmann argues that proposals by Soviet officials to cut their
defense budget ``are worth encouraging, not by increasing U.S.
defense spending and the modernization of its forces, but by
relaxing to some degree the U.S. effort.''
   Kaufmann is a non-resident senior fellow in foreign policy
studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. He is a
professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
has served as a consultant to former Secretaries of Defense Robert
S. McNamara of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and Harold
Brown of the Carter administration.
   Draft copies of his report began circulating as Pentagon sources
said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was studying suggestions
for sweeping changes, including cutting 100,000 Army soldiers,
getting rid of 100 Navy ships and closing at least a dozen Air
Force bases.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Cheney is
considering a budget plan for the 1991 fiscal year that could cut
$20 billion from the projected $317 billion spending level.
   The Pentagon is expected to submit its 1991 spending projection
to the Office of Management and Budget by Dec. 8, the official
said. Kaufmann said a copy of his study, with its call for much
deeper cuts, was sent to OMB.
   In the first five years alone, it calls for cutting one
active-duty Army division in the United States while keeping forces
at their present level in Europe until a conventional-forces
reduction agreement is signed with the Soviet Union.
   It also recommends scaling back the Air Force's B-2 ``stealth''
bomber force to 13 planes and canceling the C-17 cargo plane.
   For the Navy, it proposes the elimination of two of the 14
aircraft carrier battle groups.
   Kaufmann also proposed canceling the MX Rail Garrison strategic
missile and the smaller Midgetman missile and focusing on a
strategic deterrent based on Trident ballistic missile submarines.
   Kaufmann argued that such reductions could be made without
sacrificing U.S. global commitments or undermining arms control
talks with the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Air Force Concludes Powerful Radar Threatens All Aircraft At Georgia
Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has concluded that a powerful
radar system built to detect submarine-launched missiles off the
southeastern United States poses a potential risk to virtually all
military aircraft landing at Robins Air Force Base in central
Georgia.
   The conclusion was disclosed Tuesday in a letter made public by
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman
who last year asked the Air Force to assess the danger posed to
aircraft by the PAVE PAWS radar installation two miles south of the
Robins airfield.
   PAVE PAWS stands for Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased
Array Warning System. The 10-story, pyramid shaped installation at
Robins, one of four such facilities nationwide, consists of
thousands of computer-directed antennas that can scan 240 degrees
for 3,000 miles. The radar reportedly can identify an object the
size of a basketball 1,500 miles away.
   The Air Force acknowledged in January that since 1987, it has
been turning off the north face of the radar every time a plane
carrying an externally mounted electroexplosive device (EED) lands
at Robins.
   The shut-downs are designed to keep the radar's electromagnetic
radiation from accidentally detonating the EEDs, the tiny explosive
charges that are used, among other things, to trigger weapons
systems and ejection seats, or jettison bombs and fuel tanks.
   The explosive devices normally are detonated by an electrical
circuit, but they also can be set off high levels of
electromagnetic energy from such sources as radio waves, radar
emissions, static electricity and lightning.
   In the letter to Nunn, Brig. Gen. Burton R. Moore said an Air
Force review of the problem has concluded that the radar poses a
potential risk to aircraft with internal EEDs, such as those used
to power ejection seats, as well as to aircraft with the devices
mounted externally.
   ``It would look like most aircraft would probably have internal
EEDs of one sort or another,'' Lt. Col. Joseph W. Purka Jr., an Air
Force spokesman, said Tuesday.
   Purka said the north face of the radar now is turned off when
any plane enters the one-nautical mile restricted zone around the
facility.
   Purka said there was ``no incident that triggered'' the decision
to begin shutting down the radar for some planes.
   Moore told Nunn the shut-down procedures ``will have a minimal
impact'' on missile warning operations.
   The Air Force convened a panel of senior generals in January to
develop a permanent solution to the problem. The panel was supposed
to have finished its work by June, but Purka said Tuesday the group
recommended this month that the temporary shutdown procedures
remain in effect for another year while further study is done.

   A young woman lost for two weeks in rugged South
Carolina wilderness said Tuesday she felt desperate at times but
never thought she would die.
   Eloise Lindsay, 22, six months out of Agnes Scott College, who
held a news conference outside her parents' home, said she went
backpacking in the isolated area to try to figure out where to go
with her life next.
   She said she left the main trail and became lost after she
sensed she was being followed by men.
   ``I could tell there was no good intent involved,'' she said but
added there was no clear indication they meant her harm.
   ``I used instinct, like a deer,'' she said, adding that the men
carried walkie-talkies and that she could hear them discussing her.
   On Nov. 4 she signed the wilderness book at the beginning of the
43-mile Foothills Trail at Table Rock State Park, putting down the
names of Eloise and George Lindsay.
   Miss Lindsay, an experienced backpacker, said Tuesday she put
down a second name so as not to advertise that she was in the woods
alone.
   She said she left the trail the following Tuesday. When she
didn't complete the hike as expected, rescuers on Sunday, Nov. 12,
launched a search involving more than 100 people.
   She was found Monday by a deer hunter, two days after the search
for her had been called off.
   ``I was kind of delirious at that point,'' she said earlier in
an interview with the Greenville, S.C. Piedmont newspaper. ``I
said, `I don't know if I can trust you.'''
   The hunter, Wayne Hooper of Brevard, S.C., took her to his
vehicle and got help.
   ``I knew I was not going to die,'' she said Tuesday.
   ``There were times when I felt desperation. I felt no hope
sometimes. But it was my life and nobody was going to take it away
from me,'' she said.
   She said she ditched her pack and kept only some dried apples to
eat.
   ``I felt I had to let go of my belongings to survive, and run as
far and as fast as I could,'' she said.
   She said she saw rescue helicopters overhead but didn't build a
fire to attract attention because it might have given her away to
the men she believed were chasing her.
   ``I wasn't hungry,'' she said. ``It didn't matter. I was too
scared and cold to be hungry.''
   Miss Lindsay said she found a cache of doughnuts and pound cake
hanging from a tree and sought shelter from rain in a burned-out
truck.
   She had infected blisters on both feet and was carried to and
from her news conference Tuesday.
   She said she learned from the ordeal that ``life is valuable and
a lot of people care about me. Everything will be a little more
important now.''

   A film and theater director who opposes censorship
was named culture minister Tuesday by the Soviet legislature, which
had rejected Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's nominee.
   ``The ministry should not allow or ban; it should expand the
possibilities of workers in art,'' the new minister, Nikolai
Gubenko, was quoted as saying by the official news agency Tass.
   Only eight votes were cast against Gubenko in the 542-seat
Supreme Soviet legislature, according to Tass.
   Last summer, the lawmakers refused to reconfirm Vasily Zakharov
as culture minister, as Ryzhkov had wanted, and the post was vacant
until Gubenko was elected.
   Tass reported that in his statement to the legislature, Gubenko
said he will seek to create a climate fostering creativity, provide
legal protection against officialdom and dismantle restrictions on
creative work.
   For the past two years, the 48-year-old Gubenko has served as
chief director of Moscow's Taganka Theater.
   In the 1960s, Gubenko made his debut in that theater, which
under then-director Yuri Lyubimov became one of Moscow's most
politically progressive and provocative stages.
   Gubenko also has directed many feature films.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk asked
for an official report on alleged killings by police death squads,
but newspapers demanded Tuesday that an independent inquiry be
conducted.
   Casper Venter, spokesman for De Klerk, said the president told
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok last week to provide a
``detailed, in-depth'' report on the allegations that opponents of
the government have been assassinated.
   ``This may satisfy the president, but it will not satisfy anyone
else,'' said The Star, the nation's largest daily. Its editorial
was one of many demanding an inquiry by someone outside the
official establishment.
   ``Only a full-scale, open judicial inquiry can clear the air,''
said the paper, which often opposes the government. ``Without it,
the stain on South Africa will be indelible.''
   Three former policemen, including a white captain, have said
they took part in the killings on orders from superiors.
   A former police commissioner, a ranking officer investigating
the bombing of an anti-apartheid church organization and other high
officers still in service were named by former Capt. Dirk Johannes
Coetzee during an interview in Mauritius last week, after he left
South Africa.
   ``It is neither right, nor fair to the police, to appoint the
head of the (internal affairs division) to investigate such
horrendous and politically explosive allegations against his own
colleagues,'' the Cape Times newspaper said.
   That official and a provincial attorney general were appointed
to investigate when the charges first arose in an affidavit by a
black former security policeman.
   Butane Nofomela, scheduled to hang Oct. 20 for the murder of a
white farmer in a case with no apparent political overtones,
summoned lawyers the night before and signed a statement that
Coetzee was his superior in a death squad that killed political
activists, prisoners and African National Congress guerrillas.
   He has been granted a stay of execution while his allegations
are checked. Investigators did not get in touch with Coetzee, who
was given a medical discharge from the police in 1986, and he left
the country more than two weeks later.
   Last weekend, newspapers quoted black former policeman David
Tshikalange as saying he also was part of a police death squad and
had left the country.
   ``It is essential that the truth comes to light. There should
not be a scrap of suspicion about the police being neutral in its
duty of keeping law and order,'' said Die Burger, an Afrikaans
language paper that supports the government.
   Business Day, the leading financial daily, commented: ``The
credibility of the police has simply collapsed. The general public
reaction to the ... allegations has been that, given the secrecy in
which the police operate and the accumulation of unsolved murder
cases in which the victims have been opponents of the government,
an assassination squad might well have existed.'' Nofomela's
statement focused mainly on the killing in 1982 of Griffiths
Mxenge, a black lawyer and civil rights activist. He and Coetzee
said Mxenge was stabbed to death in an attack made to look like a
robbery, his dogs were poisoned and his car was taken away and
burned.
   In parts of the statement obtained Tuesday by the independent
South African Press Association, Nofomela said a radio-tape deck
was removed from Mxenge's car before it was destroyed and was
installed in a police vehicle used by Brig. Willem Schoon.
   Both Nofomela and Coetzee said Schoon ordered the killing, and
Nofomela said the brigadier supervised several squads that carried
out assassinations and other crimes in South Africa and neighboring
countries.
   Schoon has refused to talk to the press. Police headquarters in
Pretoria issued a statement Tuesday saying his retirement Oct. 31
had been planned since July and was not related to the allegations.
   Dozens of killings of anti-apartheid activists in the 1980s
remain unsolved and human rights groups have said for years they
believed security forces were responsible.

   A Lutheran minister on Tuesday
criticized U.S. and Canadian aid to El Salvador, where he directed
an orphanage until his arrest by Salvadoran security forces.
   The Rev. Brian Rude said he planned a speaking tour to address
the suffering of many Salvadorans, who resent the foreign
assistance to the rightist government of President Alfredo
Cristiani.
   ``Certainly the preference there would be that it (aid) be
discontinued and that the Salvadorans be allowed to resolve their
problems without what they see as that kind of interference,'' Rude
told a news conference hours after his return to Calgary.
   The United States has provided $3.5 billion in aid to battle the
decade-old insurgency, and Canada has a $12 million program that
aids farmers.
   Rude, 33, worked in an orphanage outside San Salvador for a year
and was also caring for people wounded or displaced by fighting
between government troops and leftist rebels.
   He was among a dozen Lutheran missionaries arrested Thursday by
Salvadoran security forces in a government crackdown on people
suspected of leftist sympathies.
   The arrests came hours after six Jesuit priests, their
housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter were mutilated and slain.
Roman Catholic officials blamed right-wing death squads, and the
United States said it would pressure Cristiani to fully investigate
the slayings.
   The slight Lutheran minister spent a night blindfolded and
handcuffed in a jail before his release. He returned to Calgary
late Monday to the cheers of friends and family.
   Rude, who was originally scheduled to return to Calgary in
December, said he will go on a speaking tour to tell the stories
that are not getting out.
   ``I feel disconnected. Even while I was there listening to news
reports from other parts of the world over shortwave I realized
that a lot of the information going out wasn't necessarily the way
we were experiencing it.''
   The minister said he was concerned Canadian aid was not being
distributed properly.
   ``There is some potential for the aid to be used in positive
ways, but I think if it were channelled more directly through
churches it could be used in a better way than it is being used,''
he said.
   Since 1986, the Canadian International Development Agency has
sent more than $12 million to the country in fertilizer that is
sold by a local bank on the open market. The proceeds are used for
special projects.
   ``I feel the aid we offer as a Canadian government _ even though
it's not directed through the Salvadoran government _ does offer
some legitimacy to the government of El Salvador which can be
interpreted in the wrong way.''
   More than 1,000 people have died since the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front launched a nationwide offensive Nov. 11.
At least 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the
insurgency.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 55 U.S. military advisers
are based in El Salvador, limited in number by Congress and
forbidden from firing unless they are fired upon.
   A U.S. source said the military men trapped in a guerrilla
attack on the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel on Tuesday were not part
of the adviser group, but were on a two-week training mission and
had been due to leave Tuesday.
   The source, who declined to be further identified, would not say
how large the group was, where it was based in the United States or
its specific mission.
   The limit on advisers was set in 1980, a year before the first
ones arrived, to avoid the appearance of the type of military
buildup that occurred in Vietnam. But officials say the number is
often larger because rotations overlap and the advisers are joined
by logistical and administrative support.
   The advisers come to train the Salvadoran armed forces to battle
guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   They are assigned to each of the six Salvadoran military bases
and other major installations. Others work with the navy, air
force, joint chiefs of staff or at a military training school,
using both classroom work and military exercises.
   The advisers train Salvadoran soldiers in patrolling,
counterinsurgency techniques and other tactics in a program that
draws from courses in Venezuela, Colombia, Israel and Britain as
well as the United States.
   The rules of engagement for the Americans bar them from entering
zones where combat is likely or from taking part in patrols. But if
fired upon, they can fire back, as at least one did in a Sept. 13,
1988, guerrilla attack on El Paraiso, the 4th army brigade
headquarters in northern Chalatenango province.
   Sgt. Gregory Fronius was killed in a March 1987 attack at El
Paraiso, the only American soldier to die in combat in the
10-year-old Salvadoran war.
   Eleven other U.S. military personnel have been killed in El
Salvador, five in shootings and six in a helicopter crash.

   Congressional passage of a deficit reduction
package is expected to force a 1.5 percent budget cut on defense
spending for this fiscal year, but the Pentagon spokesman said
Tuesday the precise effect is unclear.
   ``What that translates into in terms of people, and systems ...
we are not prepared to say,'' said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   While saying that the impact could be ``$6 or $7 billion,''
Williams added that Pentagon officials are not yet able to estimate
the exact magnitude of the cuts under the complicated features of
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law.
   The figure is widely expected to be at least several billion
dollars, at least.
   Although Congress approved a $286 billion defense budget for the
1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, President Bush has not yet
signed it into law.
   Williams said it is difficult to determine the exact nature of
the impact of the cuts, because different rules may apply to
various DOD accounts under the budget reduction law.
   ``It's very hard to know precisely what the impact would be. But
we think it would be about a 1.5 percent recutive for the Defense
Department over four months,'' Williams said.
   Had the terms of the Gramm-Rudman law been fully enforced over a
year's time defense programs would have to be pared by $8 billion,
or half the $16 billion spending reductions the law would have
automatically imposed on most federal programs.
   Bush stated repeatedly in recent weeks that he preferred
retaining the across-the-board cuts for a full year to accepting
congressional efforts to reduce the deficit, which he said
contained phony savings.
   Pentagon officials had warned of severe cutbacks in military
personnel and weapons acquisition if the Gramm-Rudman cuts had been
left in place the entire year.
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers ran into last-minute delays in
beginning debate on the $14.7 billion budget-cutting bill for the
current fiscal year.
   The bill relies heavily on across-the-board cuts triggered last
month by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, a mechanism
designed to shrink federal spending.
   Williams said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and his top
aides are also in the final stages of ``putting together some final
numbers'' for the department's 1991 fiscal year budget.
   Department sources said the secretary is considering a cut
ranging from $10 billion to $20 billion for the next year, bringing
the level down to the range of around $297 billion.
   The spokesman refused to confirm those figures, saying with a
laugh, ``I've heard numbers lower and I've heard nubmers higher.''
   Williams said Cheney had also spent part of the day discussing
with the service chiefs their suggestions for the long-term cuts
for the years 1992-94, which have been reported to be in the range
of $180 billion.
   The spokesman said that no decisions have been made on those
cuts, but that the talks have been ``a good starting point.''

<TEXT>
   A federal panel Tuesday accused Massachusetts
Attorney General James Shannon of unfairly delaying the Seabrook,
N.H., nuclear power plant and reaffirmed its view that evacuation
plans for nearby residents are adequate.
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, in a 41-page memo dated
Monday and made public Tuesday, said concerns raised by a
higher-level regulatory board should not prevent Seabrook from
getting a full-power operating license.
   Using unusually harsh language, the licensing board said Shannon
had raised ``the specter of the deplored `endless loop of
litigation,''' in opposing Seabrook even though Seabrook is
entitled to a license.
   ``The attorney general of Massachusetts is carrying out his
announced strategy of filing contentions at every opportunity,''
the board wrote, adding that Shannon's ``large staff of assistants
with their fecund word processors can produce motions for renewed
litigation faster than the board and parties can deal with them.''
   If the practice is allowed to continue, the board wrote, ``there
is no hope for the Seabrook Station despite applicants' fairly won
victory.''
   Stephen Jonas, Shannon's top deputy handling the Seabrook issue,
said the licensing board's decision was based on impatience, not
law.
   ``The thrust of the decision is `We're tired of this
litigation.' There's no legal substance to their arguments,'' Jonas
said. ``They're trying to railroad this thing through.''
   The memo comes a week after the board touched off a furor among
Seabrook opponents by ruling that Seabrook should be granted a
full-power license despite concerns raised by the Atomic Safety and
Licensing Appeal Board. Shannon called the ruling ``lawless.''
   Both the licensing and appeal boards are branches of the federal
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<HEAD>Snow Storm Over New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful storm system raked parts of New England with high
wind, low temperatures and heavy snow Tuesday, a day after it
pushed a line of damaging thunderstorms across much of the
Northeast.
   But temperatures hit record highs on the southern and central
Plains.
   Wind blowing at 30 to 50 mph, with gusts to 58 mph, caused
considerable blowing and drifting of snow in Maine, along with
subzero wind chill readings. And a gale warning extended all the
way southward along the coast to Virginia.
   By midday, the storm had dumped 17 inches of snow at South
Lincoln, Vt., with 16 inches at the Middlebury Snow Bowl of Vermont
and 12 inches at Farmington, Maine, the National Weather Service
said. Rumford, Maine, got 3 inches of snow during the six-hour
period up to 1 p.m. EST.
   The high wind in Maine downed trees and power lines in some
areas. Outside Maine, wind gusted to 54 mph at Providence, R.I.,
during the morning and to 55 mph at Boston.
   The storm, centered off the coast of Maine by afternoon,
produced severe thunderstorms which raked Pennsylvania, southern
New York state, southern New England, New Jersey and the
Washington, D.C., area with high wind Monday.
   The storm continued to produce strong wind Tuesday as far south
as the Carolinas and as far west as Ohio and eastern Michigan.
   That wind produced snow squalls around the lower Great Lakes
region, with heavy snow reported in northeastern Ohio, where the
towns of Jefferson and Andover had received 5 inches of snow from
late Monday to midday Tuesday.
   Elsewhere, an upper level weather disturbance moving
southeastward out of eastern Montana produced light snow across
North Dakota and Minnesota, with up to 4 inches possible in
Minnesota by Wednesday morning.
   A few light showers were scattered from Louisiana to
north-central Oklahoma.
   Unseasonably high temperatures were over parts of the southern
and central high Plains, with readings in the 70s across much of
Texas and in the 50s and 60s to the north.
   Cheyenne, Wyo., tied its record of 64 degrees; Colorado Springs,
Colo., hit a record 70; Midland, Texas, tied its record of 81; and
San Angelo, Texas, warmed to a record 83.

<HEAD>Safety Groups Say Makers Lax on Air Bag Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three auto safety groups accused the federal
government Tuesday of failing to promote and enforce air bag rules,
but a government highway safety spokesman said car passenger
protection is its top priority.
   Public Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety and Motor Voters also
issued a ``report card'' on air bags, giving failing grades to all
but four auto manufacturers for laxity in installation of the
passenger-protection devices.
   A Virginia woman, appearing at a news conference with the
coalition of safety and consumer groups, said she survived a 110
mph head-on collision because an air bag popped out of her steering
wheel.
   The groups estimate that nearly one-third of the 10 million 1990
cars sold in the United States will be equipped with driver's-side
air bags, compared to about 400,000 of the 1989 models. A new
safety administration rule requires either a driver's air bag or
lap and shoulder belts that automatically encircle both front-seat
occupants in all 1990-model cars.
   ``NHTSA's engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags,''
said Joan Claybrook, head of Public Citizen. She said the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which she once headed, needs
to promote air bags and closely monitor air bag use to perfect the
several systems that are being installed in new cars.
   Ms. Claybrook said the agency should conduct its crash tests at
higher speeds and upgrade its standards to mandate air bags for
small vans as well as cars.
   ``We are dumbfounded and mystified by her criticism,'' said
NHTSA spokesman Barry McCahill.
   He said the agency has made the promotion of all types of
occupant protection its ``number one priority.''
   McCahill said the agency's decision to allow manufacturers the
option of installing air bags on the driver's side in combination
with automatic belts on the passenger side initially has
accelerated the program. Eventually, passenger-side air bags will
also be required, he said.
   ``It's truly good to be here, literally,'' said Denise Rusk of
Kilmarnock, Va., who said she could not remember what happened
after a Ford station wagon crossed into her lane on Sept. 22, 1988,
and smashed head-on into her car. Both vehicles were going 55 mph,
putting the force of the impact at 110 mph.
   Showing no sign of her injuries, Mrs. Rusk said she suffered 36
broken bones, but the air bag prevented her from slamming into the
steering wheel and dashboard of her new Chrysler LeBaron
convertible. The driver of the other car was killed.
   ``Everything around the air bag seemed to be broken,'' she said.
   Mrs. Rusk said she planned to buy another LeBaron convertible
with an airbag.
   The auto safety groups gave Chrysler Corp. the highest score on
its air bag ``report card'' of the 12 major manufacturers selling
cars in the United States, followed by Mercedes. Ford and Volvo
tied for third place.
   All other automakers ``failed,'' said Clarence Ditlow of the
Center for Auto Safety. General Motors ranked 5th.
   Manufacturers ranking at the bottom, in order after GM, were
Toyota, Volkswagen, Mazda, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai and Subaru.
   GM President Robert C. Stempel said in a statement that the
company expects to be the largest producer of cars with air bags by
1994, with plans for more driver's-side air bags in 1991 and
passenger-side bags in some 1992 models.
   ``GM has taken great care in designing its air bag system,''
Stempel said. ``As a result, we believe our system supplies
superior supplemental protection for our customers.'' He cautioned,
along with the safety groups, that lap-shoulder belts always should
be used, even in cars with air bags.
   The groups said the rankings were based on the number of 1990
models equipped with the safety devices as standard equipment,
plans for future installation of air bags, protection devices used
in all seating positions of cars, information provided to dealers
and the contents of company ads.
   Ditlow said two Honda dealers told consumer surveyors that air
bags might blow up in the driver's face, which he said is ``a
stunning piece of misinformation.''
   A spokeswoman for Honda, Toni Harrington, said she had never
heard of such a claim being made by Honda dealers.
   ``We would not be putting air bags in our cars if they were not
considered safe,'' she said. Honda offers air bags only in its
top-line Legends but plans to expand their use to other models, Ms.
Harrington said.

   The White House hinted broadly Tuesday that
U.S. military force might be used to assist Americans trapped in a
hotel seized by by leftist guerrillas in El Salvador. President
Bush said it was ``a tough situation.''
   ``The president believes very strongly in our responsibility to
protect American citizens,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Four U.S. military advisers were among the Americans and other
foreigners that the rebels said they ``captured'' at a luxury hotel
in northern San Salvador. However, there was some doubt about the
guerrillas' claims.
   At least six armed military men, believed to be the U.S.
advisers, were seen by an Associated Press reporter barricaded on
the fourth floor of the hotel. They were brandishing M-16 rifles.
   Guerrillas and an unknown number of guests were on the fifth
floor and guerrillas on the third floor.
   One of the Americans told reporters in the hotel that he and his
companions were not hostages, but could not leave. ``We're here
because we feel we can't leave safely,'' he said. One of the
military men said they did not fire at the rebels because they were
not shot at.
   Fitzwater refused to say what steps were being considered but
added, ``We are making plans as necessary, and we feel we have a
very specific responsibility in this area.'' He said no options _
including military ones _ were being ruled out.
   ``It's a tough situation there,'' Bush told congressional
leaders summoned to the White House to discuss his summit next week
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Afterward, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``If diplomatic notes
and representations won't get them free, then we must do what we
must do. That would include in my book military action, but I'm
just speaking for myself.'' He said Bush did not discuss military
options.
   The State Department issued a warning to U.S. citizens not to
travel to El Salvador and urged Americans already there to register
with the U.S. Embassy.
   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Pentagon was making preparations to send ``intelligence and
tactical assistance'' to El Salvador. He declined to elaborate on
the number of men, the equipment they would carry or from where
they would travel.
   He later said special operation forces were put on a heightened
alert.
   ``Although always on alert for this type of situation, their
status has been raised,'' he said.
   The source said any involvement of U.S. military personnel
depended on a request for assistance from Salvadoran President
Alfredo Cristiani, followed by the final go-ahead from Bush.
   Comparing the holding of the four military advisers to the
murder of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon, he said:
``We're not going to get another bloody eye. Not this time, not
again.''
   The source said military strategists did not rule out direct
U.S. intervention but said they would rather see Salvadoran troops
acting on the advice of U.S. advisers.
   As recently as Monday, Bush reaffirmed his administration's
strong support for the right-wing government of President Alfredo
Cristiani against the guerrillas. The United States has provided
about $3.5 billion in the past 10 years to oppose the insurgency
with weapons and other American support.
   Bush was briefed several times during the day on San Salvador by
top military and foreign policy advisers.
   Fitzwater also said a group of officials from the Pentagon, CIA,
State Department and National Security Council met in the White
House situation room to monitor events. The panel, known as the
deputies' committee, was formed to improve coordination in the
aftermath of the abortive coup in Panama.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said no
negotiations were under consideration with the rebels, whom she
called ``terrorists, pure and simple.''
   She said about a dozen of the rebels, deliberately targeting
civilians, had entered the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel shortly
before dawn. They were later reinforced by up to 150 guerrillas,
some of them set up as snipers in the area, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Although the hotel is called the Sheraton, the U.S.-based hotel
chain said it sold its interest several years ago.
   Mrs. Tutwiler said the Salvadoran army had surrounded the hotel.
She described the situation as ``very fluid and dangerous'' and in
an ambiguous warning to the rebels, declared: ``We will not
speculate on the steps the United States and the Salvadoran
government might take.''
   Fitzwater told reporters at the White House that the rebels had
``embarked on a despicable road of violence by threatening
citizens, Americans and innocent citizens of all nations who may be
in their path.''
   ``The United States stands committed to the people and the
government of El Salvador,'' the spokesman said.
   Similarly, Fitzwater said: ``The president believes very
strongly in our responsibility to protect American citizens. But we
cannot speculate on steps the U.S. or the Salvadoran government
might be undertaking or considering at this time.''
   ``These Marxist guerrillas have shown their true colors,''
Fitzwater said. ``They are attacking defenseless citizens in a
civilian hotel and using the surrounding neighborhood of
defenseless Salvadoran citizens as a shield against the government
forces.''
   The rebels launched an offensive a little more than a week ago,
occupying poor and working-class neighborhoods in the vicinity of
the capital. There were indications on Monday that their offensive
had subsided under pressure of strong air and ground attacks by
government forces. However, the seizure of the Sheraton indicated a
new show of strength by the guerrillas.

   The Pentagon announced on Tuesday it took two
steps to help control the spread of ballistic missile technology,
including tightening oversight of foreign and domestic
manufacturers of missile parts that deal with the Department of
Defense.
   The actions are designed to help curb the export of sensitive
missile technologies to nations such as Iraq, said one Pentagon
official, who spoke on condition he not be named.
   Under the new procedures, the Defense Department will now
require domestic and foreign contracting companies to comply with
the laws and regulations of their own government in regard to
missile-related export controls, as well as those of the United
States.
   In addition, the department will establish procedures to ensure
that its cooperative defense programs are in compliance with
Missile Technology Control Regime, a 10-nation agreement among
Western nations to curb the spread of dangerous missiles.
   ``This means we can put pressure on the contractors, foreign and
domestic. It gives us more leverage. We'll have the authority now
to look at what business they do with other nations, and if we
don't like it, we won't do business with them,'' the source said.
   ``At a minimum, these initiatives will encourage DOD
contractors, including their subsidiaries, to act responsibly in
missile related exports,'' the Pentagon said in a statement
announcing the steps.

<HEAD>Ceausescu Suggests Soviets Give Up Moldavia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Nicolae Ceausescu suggests
the Soviet Union give up territory gained through a pact with Nazi
Germany that would include Moldavia, part of which Josef Stalin
took from Romania.
   In comments from a speech to the 14th Romanian Communist Party
Congress, published Tuesday, Ceausescu said the non-aggression pact
of 1939 in which Stalin and Adolf Hitler divided Eastern Europe
into spheres of influence should be canceled.
   Among countries and territories assigned to the Soviet Union
were the Baltic republics _ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ and
Bessarabia, Romanian until 1940 and now part of Soviet Moldavia.
The Soviet Union also absorbed the Baltic states in 1940.
   Ceausecu, a Communist autocrat in his own country and a maverick
in the Soviet bloc, told the party congress:
   ``First of all, a clear, unequivocal stand of condemnation and
cancellation must be taken on all the accords concluded with
Hitler's Germany ... to eliminate all the consequences of those
accords and dictates.''
   He did not go into detail, but his allusion to Hitler-Stalin
pact was clear. Ceausescu's suggestion comes at a time of political
and ethnic turmoil in many parts of the Soviet Union, including
Moldavia and the Baltic republics.
   In the speech, delivered Monday to the opening session of the
congress, the Romanian leader also rejected political and economic
liberalization of the kind sweeping through the Soviet bloc.
   His contempt for reform was contained in a prepared text of the
speech, which lasted more than five hours. He departed from the
text to comment on the 1939 treaty.
   Romania's official media published their first reports of unrest
in the Moldavia, where 60 percent of the people are ethnic
Romanians.
   Scinteia, the Communist Party daily, carried a dispatch Tuesday
from the official Soviet news agency Tass that described a
crackdown on ethnic Romanian demonstrators in the city of Kishinve
several days earlier.
   A Western diplomat said privately Romania was showing increased
interest recently in its former territory, which officials still
call Bessarabia.
   Although regaining the territory ``may be part of his vision,''
the diplomat said, Ceausescu's primary purpose probably was to
demonstrate independence of Moscow.
   Romanian officials, speaking anonymously for fear of
retribution, agreed that Ceausescu appeared to be making more of a
political statement than a demand for the return of lost territory.

   A majority of the American public closely
followed news of the San Francisco earthquake and the opening of
the Berlin Wall but paid little attention to other major news
events in the past month, according to a survey by the Times Mirror
publishing company.
   The destruction caused by the Oct. 17 earthquake aroused the
close attention of 73 percent of Americans, Times Mirror said.
   In the four-year history of the survey, it said, that level of
interest was exceeded only by the 80 percent who closely followed
the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986.
   Half the American public closely followed the news of the
breaching of the Berlin Wall, but comparatively little interest was
shown in the resumption of fighting in Nicaragua, the World Series
or state and local elections, according to the Times Mirror News
Interest Index for November.
   Only 13 percent of those surveyed said they followed the
Nicaraguan story or U.S. election coverage closely, while 23
percent said they paid close attention to the World Series.
   Times Mirror said 44 percent of those surveyed rated coverage of
the earthquake and Berlin Wall stories as excellent. Typically,
about 20 percent give the press an excellent rating for its
coverage of a national news story.
   The survey results were based on telephone interviews with 1,230
adults aged 18 or older during the Nov. 9-12 period. Times Mirror
said results based on the total sample had a margin of error of
three percentage points.
   Times Mirror said interest in the San Francisco quake was high
in all regions of the country and among all types of Americans.
Nearly two-thirds of people under 30, who usually are least
interested in all kinds of news, said they followed quake coverage
closely.

   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was first again but
the ABC miniseries ``Small Sacrifices'' ran a close second in the
Nielsen ratings for the week ended Nov. 19.
   Bill Cosby was at the top for the third straight week and five
other NBC comedies were in the Top 10.
   ``Small Sacrifices,'' starring Farrah Fawcett as an Oregon woman
convicted of shooting her children so that she could be with her
boyfriend, was next with the second of two parts. The first part
was 12th in the previous week's ratings.
   NBC won the week by a wide margin. Its average in the A.C.
Nielsen Co. survey was 16. ABC was second with 13.2 and CBS was
third with 11.7. The rating is the percentage of the nation's 92.1
million television homes tuned in to a program.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. scored its highest average for regular
programming on a Sunday with 8.1. That's topped only by a 9.7
rating for its telecast of the Emmy awards on Sept. 17. A one-hour
``America's Most Wanted'' special beat both ABC and NBC in the 8-9
p.m. time slot. It was 48h in the listing, but ``Married...With
Children'' did even better as it tied for 41st place.
   NBC leads for the season-to-date with 15.1. ABC is second with
13.5 and CBS third with 12.4. NBC is also ahead in the November
sweeps. The Nielsen ratings: NBC 15.5, ABC 12.6, CBS 12.0. The
Arbitron ratings: NBC 15.4, ABC 12.8, CBS 11.9.
   Here's the Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ABC miniseries
``Small Sacrifices'' Part II, NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's
``Cheers,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' NBC's
``Empty Nest,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's ``Dear John'' and
ABC's ``The Wonder Years.''
   ``Small Sacrifices'' did better in the ratings than the regular
ABC Tuesday shows it replaced, ``Roseanne,'' the just-canceled
``Chicken Soup'' and ``thirtysomething.'' ABC's other Tuesday show,
besides ``The Wonder Years,'' ``Who's the Boss?,'' was 12th.
   The opening chapter of the CBS miniseries ``Till We Meet Again''
was in a three-way tie for 24th place. It lost out in head-to-head
competition Sunday with NBC's ``Perry Mason'' movie, which was
17th. The miniseries, based on the novel by Judith Krantz, did come
out ahead of ABC's telecast of the feature film ``Outrageous
Fortune.''
   ``Midnight Caller,'' in which Kay Lenz returned last Tuesday as
an AIDS victim, came in 50th. It was up against the last hour of
``Small Sacrifices.''
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' kept its lead among the evening
news shows. The ratings: ABC 11.2, CBS 10.7, NBC 10.1.
   The major networks' lowest-rated show of the week was CBS'
``Wolf.'' The five bottom network shows were: CBS' ``Peaceable
Kingdom'' and ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' tied, CBS'
``Island Son,'' ABC's ``Homeroom,'' ABC's ``Living Dolls'' and CBS'
``Wolf.''

<TEXT>
   Peace talks between the Nicaraguan government
and the Contra rebels were suspended Tuesday night after the two
sides were unable to agree on terms for a cease-fire.
   Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco told
reporters his government plans to call for an emergency meeting of
Central American presidents to decide on next steps.
   The chief Contra negotiator, Col. Enrique Bermudez, expressed
regret over the breakdown and he blamed the Sandinista negotiators.
   He said the rebel side had made flexible proposals and was
willing to continue the talks.
   The talks collapsed when the Contras refused a Sandinista demand
that they agree to a partial withdrawal of their forces to base
camps in Honduras, said Paul Reichler, an American member of the
Sandinista negotiating team.
   The Contras refused to go beyond a promise not to infiltrate any
more forces from the units based in Honduras.
   Tinoco said the Contra refusal to withdraw troops to Honduras
``shows they are not interested in peace.'' He also criticized the
State Department for doing ``absolutely nothing'' to facilitate an
agreement.
   Mediators from the Organization of American States and the
United Nations issued a statement saying they will remain in
contact with both sides for the purpose of reconvening the
discussions ``at the earliest date.''
   Hours earlier, the Sandinistas unveiled a comprehensive
cease-fire proposal that omitted a previous demand for the
withdrawal of all Contra forces from Nicaragua and called instead
for a pullback of 2,300 insurgents.
   The new proposal, outlined by Tinoco at a news conference, would
establish corridors through which the retreating Contras would
return safely to base camps in Honduras.
   The process would be verified by 620 United Nations peacekeepers
who are scheduled to take up duties in Central America shortly.
Under the proposal, both sides would agree to cease all military
operations inside Nicaragua until Dec. 31.
   ``If the Contras do not accept the proposal, they have no
interest in a cease-fire,'' Tinoco told reporters at the Nicaraguan
Embassy.
   The U.N. peacekeepers will be comprised of West Germans,
Spaniards and Canadians. In addition to monitoring the cease-fire,
they also are entrusted with ensuring that the territory of one
Central American county is not used to launch subversive activities
in another.
   The negotiations began on Nov. 9 and were aimed at restoring the
cease-fire that President Daniel Ortega suspended eight days
earlier after alleging that the rebels had engaged in widespread
terrorist activities.
   As of Monday, the negotiators had met eight times, with
mediators from the Organization of American States and the United
Nations prodding the two sides toward agreement.
   The Contras have called for a cease-fire in place as an initial
step aimed at an overall accommodation between the two sides,
culminating in the peaceful rebel reintegration in Nicaraguan
society. National elections are set for Feb. 25.
   Tinoco said the 2,300 Contras being asked to leave under the
Sandinista proposal represent the number of rebels who have
infiltrated into Nicaragua from the Honduran base camps in recent
weeks.
   The Contras maintain that there has been no increase, only a
rotation of forces. But the State Department has said there has
been a major infiltration of Contras since early October, raising
the total number inside Nicaragua to about 5,000.
   Tinoco indicated that the proposal was about as far as the
Sandinistas could go in efforts to meet the rebels half way. He
noted that the government initially had demanded a complete
demobilization of the Contras as the price for a cease-fire but
dropped that provision last week.
   The five Central American presidents called last August for the
voluntary demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5. Since that date
is no longer feasible, the Sandinista plan requests the five
presidents to set Dec. 31 as the new target date.

<BYLINE>Hakim Pleads Guilty ^By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessman Albert Hakim pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor and one of his corporations used to divert arms sale
profits pleaded guilty to a felony Tuesday in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   The Iranian-born Hakim admitted that he had helped supplement
the salary of ex-White House aide Oliver North by paying for a
security fence at North's home with funds from ``the Enterprise,''
the complex of foreign companies Hakim operated in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   Lake Resources Inc., a Swiss company used as a conduit for Iran
arms sale money and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, pleaded guilty
to theft of government property, a felony carrying a maximum
penalty of up to $500,000.
   Hakim, who faces sentencing Feb. 1, could face up to a year in
jail and a $100,000 fine. It is illegal to supplement the salaries
of government employees.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell initially rejected the
proposed plea agreement, calling it a ``charade'' and complaining
that the U.S. government wasn't being given an opportunity to
recover the diverted money.
   But after meeting with prosecutors and defense attorneys, Gesell
returned to the courtroom and accepted the pleas, which were
accompanied by a plea agreement slightly altered at his request.
   Outside the courtroom, associate independent counsel Stuart
Abrams said the plea agreement with Lake Resources, now a paper
company with no assets, does not keep the government from seeking
restitution.
   Some $3.8 million from the administration's secret arms sales to
Iran was funneled to the rebel force during a congressional ban on
U.S. military aid to the Contras.
   About $8 million from the maze of companies operated by Hakim
and his business partner Richard Secord remain frozen in Swiss bank
accounts which the two men formerly controlled. The funds came from
third-country contributions to the Contras, private fund-raising
efforts in the United States and the secret arms sales.
   The plea agreement filed with the court by the government says
that from late 1985 to November 1986, Hakim, his business partner
Richard Secord, North and national security adviser John Poindexter
used their influence ``to generate and divert approxmiately $16.2
million ... to Enterprise bank accounts.''
   Hakim agreed to cooperate with the investigation by independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh, to testify at pending trials and to supply
financial records and other documents.
   In North's case, the $13,000 security fence and other equipment
constituted an illegal gratuity and his acceptance of it was one of
the three felony counts for which North was convicted.
   Hakim, answering Gesell's question ``what was it'' that North
got, said the security fence was installed ``for the protection of
Col. North ... from terrorist attacks.'' A terrorist organization
run by Abu Nidal had threatened to kill North, acording to
congressional testimony.
   Asked how he concealed the gift, Hakim said ``By maintaining ...
bank accounts in a secret manner.''
   Hakim's other answers were brief ``Yes, your honor'' or ``No,
your honor'' responses.
   In another Iran-Contra development, Former President Reagan's
attorneys were granted a two-week delay by U.S. District Judge
Harold H. Greene for consideration of a court challenge to a
subpoena asking Reagan to produce documents and testify at the
trial of his former national security adviser, John M. Poindexter,
who was North's boss.
   Reagan's attorneys said the subpoena ``raises novel and complex
constitutional issues'' about the power of courts over a former
chief executive.
   ``We disagree with'' Gesell's characterization of the agreement
as a charade, said Abrams.
   He said negotiations were under way on an unspecified civil
matter which could affect restitution to the U.S. government.
   Abrams said Gesell will be able to conduct a hearing on
restitution and ``whether Lake Resources transferred funds'' to
other corporations ``so that someone else could be liable'' for
returning the money to the United States.
   Hakim ``got rid of his assets to keep anybody from finding
them,'' complained Gesell. The judge said, ``I am not anxious to
conduct a trial to determine what happened'' to the money and said
the plea agreement should answer the questions of ``who diverted
the money ... who is responsible.''
   ``I am not getting an admission here of anything except 100
bucks,'' Gesell said in regard to the corporate guilty plea.
   The plea agreement specifies that Lake Resources is charged with
converting to its own use property of the United States worth more
than $100.
   Before meeting privately with prosecutors and defense attorneys,
Gesell said in court that ``You can't fancy-dance through the
paragraphs.''
   If there is ``a fancy dance,'' he said, ``there is no point in
pleading.''
   The judge called the proposed agreement ``simply public
relations efforts that don't have any place in a court.''
   At Gesell's request, two paragraphs were dropped from the
agreement concerning Hakim's guilty plea. They would have preserved
Hakim's rights to appeal an adverse decision by Gesell on a motion
that has been pending since last June.

   The House gave about 100 Soviet soldiers a
standing ovation Tuesday and a congressional tape of upcoming
events played show tunes as Congress plunged through what it hoped
was its last day of business for the year.
   With enough unresolved business to last until after midnight _
or even next week _ members of Congress were in jovial spirits as
they began the day after a late night session Monday.
   ``Maybe, it's because they're getting a raise,'' said a staff
member.
   The House went into session at 9 a.m., an hour earlier than
normal, causing some observers to ask why the lawmakers were
pushing themselves so hard.
   ``Are you kidding?'' responded Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass.,
chairman of the Rules Committee. ``Give these guys a good night's
sleep and a strong wind at their back and we'll be here until
Christmas.''
   The Senate slept in, with no floor business until noon.
   Not many House members showed up for opening formalities, but
those who did were studied carefully from the gallery by an
impressive contingent of Soviet soldiers, resplendent in their
olive and red uniforms.
   A scene that couldn't have been imagined two years ago unfolded
as the 12 or so House members recited the Pledge of Allegiance and
then turned and applauded the soldiers.
   The Soviets, members of a military choral group on tour in the
United States, clapped back.
   ``Forty-five years ago our countries were together against
Hitler,'' reminded one of the soldiers later as Reps. Steny Hoyer,
D-Md., and Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., gave the group a guided tour
of the Capitol.
   ``It's an exciting time in which we live,'' Hoyer said. ``A
hopeful time for our generation and generations to come in terms of
de-escalating the tension that has existed between the two greatest
military powers of the globe not only to our benefit, but to the
benefit of the world.''
   A few hours later, an encounter of quite a different nature
occurred between several people in the Senate gallery and the
lawmakers below.
   Demonstrators opposed to the U.S. policy in El Salvador shouted
slogans from the viewing seats and were dragged from the chamber by
Capitol police.
   The Senate responded by temporarily closing the gallery to
visitors.
   Three of the protesters were charged with disrupting Congress
and demonstrating within the Capitol. Each charge is punishable by
a maximum fine of $500 and or six months in jail.
   The long legislative day required action by both houses on much
of the same legislation, including the complicated deficit
reduction package.
   The Senate stayed in session, taking ``quorum calls'' when it
had no business to handle, but the House recessed periodically
through the day while waiting to vote on legislation.
   At lunch, the House dining room treated members and visitors to
a turkey buffet with all the Thanksgiving trimmings.
   During the morning, C-Span, which broadcasts Congress, used the
channel that usually carries the Senate to show the British
Parliament in action.
   That prompted House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., to quip to
reporters: ``I know you're going to think they're much more
interesting, and much more witty and much more stimulating in every
way.''
   Foley said he entertained the speaker of the House of Commons
about a month ago who asked him how many speakers had preceded him.
Foley replied he was the 49th Speaker of the House.
   ``He said he was the 634th. They generally date the speakership
from 1377,'' Foley said. ``And I said, `Well, that's what we call a
putdown in the United States, Mr. Speaker,' and he said, `Well,
eight of them were beheaded, two of them on the same day.'''
   Congressional staffers, eager to get their bosses out of town,
were much gentler in their approach.
   Show tunes such as ``The Impossible Dream,'' ``One Day More,''
and ``Tonight'' were programmed into the House Republican cloakroom
legislative tape of upcoming events.
   The Democrats' staff members said they were keeping their jokes
inside the cloakroom.

<HEAD>President Gets Piece of Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with Genscher saying no one should fear
possible reunification of East and West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush met Tuesday with West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who gave him a piece of
the Berlin Wall.
   ``I will treasure this,'' Bush told Genscher.
   Genscher said the gray block represented ``the thanks of the
German people to the American people for their faithfulness,
support and steadfastness in bad and good times'' that helped lead
to the opening of the wall.
   The talks between Bush and Genscher focused on the president's
Dec. 2-3 meeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in the
Mediterranean Sea off Malta, said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Bush ``indicated they would be talking about Eastern Europe and
other matters of general interest,'' Fitzwater said.
   Genscher said after the meeting that he and Bush were in
``complete agreement'' about the approach to Eastern Europe.
   ``It is important that the West gives the Soviet Union and its
allies a clear and unambiguous sign that we are aware that the
reform process will cause problems ... even of crisis proportions.''
   The West, he said, is interested that the reforms proceed in a
stable framework and has no intention of trying to take advantage
of the situation.
   ``We will for that reason do nothing that will endanger or
disturb this reform process from outside,'' Gencher said. ``We will
do everything we can to guarantee stability.''
   Genscher dismissed reports that West German officials had said
that the changes in Eastern Europe had made it impossible to deploy
a new generation of short-range U.S. nuclear missiles in Germany as
the United States has proposed.
   ``This is a theme to be discussed in '92 as was agreed in the
NATO communique,'' Genscher told reporters.
   East Germany, Genscher said, ``is on the way really to becoming
a democratic republic'' if free elections are held next year as
proposed.
   ``It's the result of a very clear policy of the West advocating
freedom and democracy all over the Europe.''
   After his 15-minute session with Bush, Genscher met with
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   Later, Genscher stressed that there should be no fear of
possible reunification of East and West Germany.
   ``It is no cause for anyone to worry if Germans opt for freedom
and democracy and if all Germans live in freedom and democracy, but
it is an enrichment for the whole of Europe,'' he said.
   ``We want no separate German way, but we want Western Europe and
Eastern Europe get closer and closer together and thereby bring the
Germans closer together.''

   ABC, CBS and CNN are planning live coverage for
both President Bush's speech and the liftoff of the space shuttle
Discovery on Wednesday night.
   NASA has said only that the liftoff is scheduled between 6:30
p.m. and 10:30 p.m. EST. Wednesday and that it will make the count
public just nine minutes ahead. However, the launch is expected to
take place about 7:30 p.m.
   President Bush is to address the nation at 9 p.m.
   ABC will cover both events, said spokeswoman Elise Adde.
   CBS plans to cover the space shuttle launch, then return to
regular programming until 9, when President Bush's speech begins.
   CNN also will cover both. If the shuttle were delayed and both
events occurred simultaneously, ``I don't know what our choice will
be,'' said spokesman Steve Haworth.
   NBC will carry Bush's speech live and make launch coverage
available to its affiliates, said spokeswoman Katherine McQuay.

   ``Robin HUD,'' the woman who admitted stealing
millions of dollars from the government and giving some of it to
the poor, was indicted Tuesday in one of the most prominent cases
of the Housing and Urban Development scandal.
   Marilyn Louise Harrell was charged with embezzling $5.6 million
from HUD, two counts of making false statements to the federal
government and one count of making false statements in connection
with a loan application.
   The indictment sends a ``firm message to those who think it's
`business as usual,' when dealing with HUD. We have zero tolerance
for theft, regardless of the reason or how it is done,'' HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp said in a statement issued before a news
conference Tuesday afternoon.
   ``She really gives charity a bad name,'' Kemp said later.
   He said stricter standards for more than 100 escrow agents who
are empowered to sell HUD property for the government are now
required, including bonding and certification.
   ``This case represents perhaps the largest single theft of
government funds ever charged against an individual,'' Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said.
   It is the fourth indictment this year involving the theft of
more than $1 million from HUD, although it may not be the largest
by the time the government investigation is concluded, Thornburgh
said.
   Despite testimony before a congressional committee that she gave
stolen HUD money to the needy, the government's eight-month probe
found that ``the single largest charity by far was herself,'' said
Breckinridge L. Willcox, U.S. attorney for Maryland.
   Government prosecutors declined to say how much of the money
their probe found had been given to charity.
   According to Willcox, about $625,000 of the embezzled funds have
been recovered by seizing Harrell's home and automobiles. ``I'm not
sure there's a whole lot left,'' he said.
   Evidence presented to a federal grand jury in Baltimore
allegedly showed that Harrell, who was entrusted with HUD funds as
a private escrow agent, misused government money on several
occasions, HUD and Justice Department sources said Monday.
   Attempts to reach Harrell's attorney, federal public defender
Anthony Gallagher, were not successful. A receptionist at his
office said Gallagher was in court on an unrelated matter.
   Harrell's testimony to Congress was among the most dramatic
during six months of hearings into allegations of fraud,
mismanagement and political favoritism at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   A discrepancy between the $5.5 million Harrell testified about
and the $5.6 million mentioned in the indictment could not
immediately be resolved.
   Two weeks after she testified, HUD seized her house in
Washington's Maryland suburbs as well as several other properties
she said she purchased with HUD money to help charities and
homeless families.
   ``I in no way justify what I have done as being anything less
than sin,'' Harrell, who was dubbed Robin HUD by federal
investigators, testified before a House subcommittee in June. ``I
do, regardless of where my life takes me from here, intend to repay
in full all monies taken.''
   Harrell said she was easily able to withhold money from HUD.
Several top officials in HUD's Washington field office, to which
she reported, were fired because of the Harrell case and other
alleged mismanagement.
   Harrell is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping
more than $10 million they were supposed to transfer to HUD.
Efforts to indict them and seek restitution are at various stages.
Harrell is the second escrow agent to be indicted.
   When she lost her house in late June, Harrell, 46, said she was
moving in with her mother in the Maryland suburb of Fort
Washington. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful; the mother's
telephone number is unlisted.
   The indictment charges Harrell with embezzling about $5.6
million belonging to HUD between November 1985 and December 1988;
giving false explanations to HUD for her delay in remitting
department funds, and lying about her net worth in an application
to the Second Federal Savings Bank for a $150,000 loan.
   Several members of the House subcommittee have been critical of
the Justice Department, accusing it of not aggressively pursuing
HUD-related crimes.
   The department's statement announcing the Harrell indictment
indirectly responded to such criticism, noting that the government
had obtained 140 HUD-related convictions nationwide in fiscal 1989
and nearly 600 in the last four years.
   Most of those cases have involved individuals charged with
defrauding HUD loan programs. Congressional critics have said
Thornburgh has shown little zeal for investigating former top
agency officials and prominent Republicans who participated in HUD
programs found to have been tainted by political influence.
   Thornburgh has rejected the criticism as partisan sniping.

   The Georgia Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a
33-year-old quadriplegic has a constitutional right to withdraw
from the breathing apparatus that has kept him alive for four years.
   But the court declined to use the case to set non-judicial
guidelines for future cases, suggesting that is a task for the
Legislature.
   The court said in a unanimous opinion that Larry McAfee's right
to discontinue the treatment falls under privacy rights guaranteed
by the state and federal constitutions.
   Those rights outweigh whatever interests the state has in
preserving life, the ruling said.
   McAfee suffered a severe spinal cord injury in a 1985 motorcycle
accident which left him a quadriplegic. He is incapable of
spontaneous respiration and is dependent upon a ventilator to
breathe.
   McAfee, living in an Alabaster, Ala., nursing home, has said he
plans to return to Georgia sometime after the holiday season to
shut off his ventilator.
   ``He is most gratified that the highest court in Georgia has
affirmed his right to decide his own destiny,'' said McAfee's
attorney Randall Davis.
   ``He is currently reviewing several options which have been
offered to him, but he does not necessarily believe that he will
change his mind as to the removal of his life support system.''
   In September, McAfee won a Superior Court judge's permission to
turn off the ventilator himself by activating a timer. But the
judge instructed the state to appeal the decision in order to
establish non-judicial procedures to guide future cases.
   The Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case only a week
ago, declined to go that far.
   It noted the existence of a ``living will'' act in Georgia which
allows competent adults to execute documents directing physicians
not to use extraordinary procedures to keep them alive if their
conditions become terminal.
   But the court said McAfee's case doesn't fit those conditions.
   ``The Legislature might well choose to legislate in this area to
provide appropriate non-judicial procedures for competent adult
patients who do not have `terminal conditions' but who wish to
exercise their rights to refuse medical treatment by the withdrawal
of life-sustaining procedures,'' the court held.
   The Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge that McAfee has a
right to a sedative to relieve the pain when the ventilator is
disconnected.
   State Attorney General Michael Bowers said he would have liked
the court to set guidelines but said: ``I'm pleased they affirmed
the (trial court's) order. ... I'm very pleased for McAfee.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under pressure by thousands of
demonstrators for a fifth day, Czechoslovakia's premier told
opposition leaders Tuesday he favored a role for non-Communists in
the government.
   Dissidents, including banned playwright Vaclav Havel, addressed
a crowd of 150,000 people jamming Wenceslas Square without police
interference. An actor later called for the resignations of
Communist Party leaders, and demonstrators chanted: ``Punish!
Punish! Punish!''
   The comments by Premier Ladislav Adamec, relayed by participants
in the meeting, were a sharp break with current government policy.
It was not clear what significance his statements would have
because the head of government traditionally has far less power
than the Communist Party leader.
   Party chief Milos Jakes, in a television appearance Tuesday
night, accused the demonstrators of trying to ``disrupt the
socialist system'' and ``unleash emotion and passions with
unforeseeable consequences.''
   Although he said he welcomed ``a dialogue with all who stand for
socialism even though they criticize abuses,'' he maintained a hard
line, denouncing organizers of the demonstrations and saying the
``cause of the working people and socialism ... is at stake.''
   A Jakes ally, Prague Communist Party boss Miroslav Stepan, said
in a statement that the opposition was whipping up ``hysteria.''
``We are calling on the workers of Prague, the members of the
people's militia (police) to stand firmly,'' said the statement
issued by the Prague party leadership.
   Adamec told a delegation that included opposition leaders he was
in favor of a ``different concept of the leading role of the
party,'' and favored having non-Communists in the government,
according to two members of the group, journalist Michael Horacek
and composer Michael Kocab. Adamec's statement about non-Communists
in the government was not carried by the CTK state news agency.
   Adamec also promised the government would not impose martial
law, and he suggested dissidents no longer be persecuted.
   The opposition members quoted him as saying the government would
not rule out talking with Charter 77, Eastern Europe's oldest human
rights group, which authorities previously refused to negotiate
with.
   However, Adamec said, protests must stop and socialism must
remain intact.
   Czechoslovakia's hard-line leaders have kept a tight rein on
society and rejected the reforms transforming other East bloc
societies.
   The leadership appears to be softening, however, in the face of
its biggest government crisis since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion
that snuffed out the ``Prague Spring'' reform period. The extent of
public discontent was underlined by the huge crowds demonstrating
Tuesday and on Monday, when 200,000 marched in the largest
demonstration ever.
   State TV also reported protesters filled the streets of
Bratislava, but it did not give a crowd estimate. At least 10,000
marched there Monday.
   On Tuesday, speakers addressed the crowd in Wenceslas Square
from the balcony of a state-run newspaper, Svobodne Slovo, which
has criticized the government.
   The Rev. Vaclav Maly, a dissident, read a message from
Czechoslovak Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek: ``We cannot wait any
longer. We need a democratic government. At this decisive moment,
no one must stand aside.''
   The crowd later dispersed, still crying,``Freedom! Freedom!''
   Witnesses said police and armored vehicles surrounded the main
offices of the federal government, but they did not interfere.
   Also Tuesday, CTK reported the general prosecutor of the Czech
republic had opened an investigation into the actions of security
forces who clubbed and fired tear gas at demonstrators Friday,
injuring scores. Dissidents said one student was killed by police
in the protest, but the government denied it.
   Czechoslovak media devoted unusual coverage to Monday's
demonstration, and employees of state TV voted to provide time on
news broadcasts for opposition opinion, a source said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the most important
exponent of reform in the East bloc, expressed strong support
Tuesday for the changes sweeping Eastern Europe, including
Czechoslovakia.
   ``I think the change is very important, and the importance of
the change will be that it will create a better society, a more
open society, a more democratic society,'' Gorbachev said in Moscow.
   In the meeting with opposition leaders, Adamec said he favored
``having in the federal government people with no membership in a
political party and members of other political parties and
especially young people,'' Horacek said.
   Horacek and Kocab belong to an organization of intellectuals
called Most, which means ``bridge.'' It promotes dialogue between
authorities and the opposition.
   Adamec also said the government was open to talks and added:
``We do not exclude anybody from the dialogue, including Charter
77.''
   ``We must free ourselves from the wrongdoings of the past,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   In its report, CTK also quoted Adamec as saying: ``We shall
protect socialism, there can be no discussion about this.'' He said
political changes were necessary but ``a dialogue about many
serious problems ... cannot be sensibly conducted in the street.''
   In addition to the representatives of Most, the 10-member
delegation included four members of the newly formed Civic Forum
umbrella opposition group, as well as members of official Communist
organizations.
   Havel walked with delegation members to the meeting but did not
take part, officials said.
   Thousands of students were on strike in Prague and other cities.
At the DAMU acting school in Prague, a center of the strike
movement, students displayed six letters from factories in Prague
supporting their demands for more democracy and an end to police
brutality. So far, workers have not been extensively involved in
the anti-government protests.
   There were other signs of protest in the capital, including
posters condemning police brutality on shop windows and office
buildings.

   A sniper's view of Elm Street beckons the
thousands of sightseers trekking to Dealey Plaza Wednesday to mark
the 26th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's death.
   The Sixth Floor Exhibit, a tribute to Kennedy's life and a
shrine for his death, opened in February amid tears and prayers.
It's open for the first time on an assassination anniversary.
   Until President's Day of this year, the public could not enter
the sixth floor of the old school book depository in downtown
Dallas, where it's believed Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots that
killed Kennedy.
   About 15,000 visited on the opening, and about 1,000 people
visit the building every day, officials say.
   The creation of an exhibit or major memorial had been delayed,
in part by fears that it would only extend any infamy attached to
the city by Kennedy's death.
   ``It was a courageous thing for Dallasites to do,'' said
Lyndalyn Adams, chairwoman of the Dallas County Historical
Foundation, which led the drive to open The Sixth Floor. ``This
city had to go back to a time when Dallas meant assassination.''
   For years, sightseers found little to mark the site of Kennedy's
fatal motorcade through downtown Dallas.
   Dallas lacked anything explaining Kennedy's death in its
historic context, said Bob Hays, Sixth Floor director.
   ``The city has been linked with the assassination by the public
throughout the world,'' Hays said. ``The city needed to address it
and this is what we have done.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, the president's brother, opposed the
exhibit, saying the family would prefer the public to remember the
president's life rather than his death.
   Mrs. Adams hopes public approval of the exhibit may change his
mind. She has sent him pages of the ``memory book'' signed by
visitors.
   He did not return several calls to his Washington office from
The Associated Press.
   The cost of a visit to the Sixth Floor is $4 to $6, with
proceeds going to the county. Visitors walk through a maze of
interpretive panels with more than 400 photographs. A narrative
encompasses Kennedy's life and death.
   Films include footage of Kennedy's motorcade rolling through
Dealey Plaza and NBC's live broadcast of Jack Ruby fatally shooting
Oswald in the basement of the Dallas Police Department.
   Through glass panels, visitors can see where investigators say
Oswald perched on boxes, ate his lunch while waiting for the
motorcade, and fired his rifle out a corner window on Nov. 22, 1963.
   The exhibit mentions the controversies over the accuracy of the
Warren Commission's report on the assassination and whether Oswald
may have had conspirators.
   Conspiracy theories are addressed more in-depth at the JFK
Assassination Information Center, a three-room, privately run
exhibit that opened in August a few blocks away.
   The center is directed by J. Gary Shaw, whose 1976 book
``Cover-Up,'' suggested the use of a second weapon and a government
coverup of the assassination. The center supplements the Sixth
Floor, Shaw said.
   ``People come to Dallas and want to see these spots,'' Shaw
said. ``Their lives were changed by what happened here.''

<HEAD>Officials Say Federal Loan That Financed Strip Club Was a Mistake</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal loans that helped finance a strip
club across the river from Ottawa, Canada's federal capital, were a
mistake that won't be repeated, officials said Tuesday.
   ``An error was made,'' Harvie Andre, minister of regional
industrial expansion, said in the House of Commons. ``Procedures
are being amended to insure this doesn't happen again.''
   The Federal Business Development Bank, a government agency, made
two loans totaling $899,000 ($1 million Canadian) to two
businessmen in Hull, Quebec, over 18 months to buy land and a
building for the bar, called Le Lido.
   ``It's against the bank's policy to finance clubs of that
kind,'' spokesman Ken Cavanagh said by telephone from bank
headquarters in Montreal. ``It was an error made at the local
level.''
   A report Monday by Radio-Canada Television, the French-language
service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., disclosed the loans to
Andre Frechette and Frank Bentivoglio. It said they totaled $1.1
million, but Cavanagh said that was too high and provided the lower
figure.
   Hull, on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River, is the site of
many office buildings in the national capital district. Le Lido is
near the Promenade du Portage, one of the largest office complexes.
   Andre said the federal agency's officers in Hull did not tell
superiors in Montreal what the loans were buying.
   During the Commons debate Tuesday in Ottawa, Donald Boudria of
the opposition Liberal Party asked: ``Haven't we had enough of this
nonsense? Why doesn't the government clean up its act once and for
all?''
   Frechette operates Le Lido and employs about 20 young women to
dance. He said in an interview with Radio-Canada that most
afternoon customers were government employees, many of high rank,
who took cigarette breaks at the club because smoking was
prohibited in government buildings.
   The Federal Business Development Bank's purpose is to make loans
and provide management counseling to small and medium-sized
businesses.
   Cavanagh said helping finance bars or discotheques would not be
against bank policy if they were not of an erotic nature.
   ``We intend to tighten up the policy and make it clearer,'' he
said. ``Senior officials of the bank are going to be looking into
the entire process.''

<HEAD>Marcos Not to Blame for Union Workers' Murders, Defense Argues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Seattle union activists were murdered in 1981
because a ``vicious thug'' didn't get his way in a union dispute,
not because the martial-law government of former Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos had marked them for death, a defense
attorney said Tuesday.
   The murders of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes at the Alaska
Cannery Workers Union offices resulted from a dispute over gambling
and work assignments in Alaskan fish canneries, Richard Hibey told
a federal court.
   Hibey is the Washington, D.C., attorney for the estate of Marcos
and for Marcos' widow, Imelda. They are among the defendants in a
$30 million civil lawsuit filed September 1982 that claims the
Marcos government ordered the Seattle killings because of Domingo
and Viernes' anti-Marcos agitation.
   The trial began Monday and is expected to last three to five
weeks.
   Friends and relatives of the dead men hope to prove before U.S.
District Judge Barbara Rothstein that Domingo and Viernes were
targeted by a Philippines intelligence network that kept track of
anti-Marcos dissidents in this country.
   Hibey called the murders an ``undeniable, terrible fact,'' but
added: ``Nothing was going on in Seattle that had anything to do
with Filipino politics that could ever rise to the level ... to
cause the deaths of Mr. Domingo and Mr. Viernes.''
   ``No matter how many witnesses, no matter how many self-styled
experts are called to testify about the politics of the
Philippines, there will be no evidence of any link, any relation,
any connection, between what these politics were and the deaths of
Mr. Domingo and Mr. Viernes,'' Hibey said.
   A jury of eight, including two alternates, is hearing the case
against the Marcoses; Rothstein will judge liability of the other
defendants.
   At the original criminal trial, at which three men were
convicted and given life prison sentences, prosecutors said the
murders occurred because Domingo and Viernes were union reformers
working to eliminate gambling in the canneries.
   That, Hibey said, is the accurate motive in the case.
   Six days before the 1981 murders, Hibey said, Viernes argued
with one of those convicted, Fortunato Dictado about dispatching
gang members to work in the canneries.
   Evidence will show that Dictado muttered, ``I'm going to get rid
of you,'' Hibey said.
   The motive, Hibey said, was simply ``the demands of a vicious
thug whose demands were not met when he wanted them to be met'' by
Viernes. Domingo died, Hibey said, ``because he happened to be
there.''
   ``This was a (union) local that had suffered from the ravages
... of bribes and kickbacks in order to get jobs, where violence
and thuggery were the order of the day,'' he said.
   On Monday, Jeff Robinson, an attorney for the plaintiffs, argued
that evidence will show that the union-dispute motive was only a
cover for the men being marked for death by Marcos' intelligence
network.
   Jailing and killing dissidents or causing them to disappear were
weapons in Marcos' anti-opponent arsenal before his government was
toppled in 1986, Robinson said.

   The state prison system must accept inmates
who have been sentenced to state prison but are being held in local
jails because of prison overcrowding, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   State District Judge Joe Hart also said the state must pay the
counties for housing and feeding the inmates.
   Numerous counties have complained that they are being forced to
house inmates who can't immediately enter state prisons because of
a federal court ordering limiting inmate population.
   Twelve counties sued the state in an effort to force the
transfer of an estimated 6,000 felons from their jails. Statewide,
an estimated 12,000 inmates have been sentenced to state prison but
are being held in local jails because the prison system has delayed
accepting them.
   Attorney General Jim Mattox said the state would appeal.
   ``There is just not enough room in the inn,'' Mattox said. ``We
can't violate the federal court order and take additional prisoners
into the Department of Corrections.''
   Hart did not specify how much the Texas Department of
Corrections should pay the counties for housing the state prisoners.
   Ann Clark Snell, representing 11 counties in the lawsuit, said
the counties want compensation because the state neglected its
duty. She said each inmate costs the state $40 a day to maintain.
   At that rate, the cost for 6,000 inmates in the 12 counties
could be more than $87 million a year.
   Mattox urged Gov. Bill Clements to allow the current special
legislative session to consider payments to counties. Clements had
no immediate comment on the ruling or Mattox's suggestion.
   Hart said there are many measures that the state could use to
take the prisoners off the counties' hands.
   ``Such other methods include contracting with private vendors,
the federal government, and local government, and greater use of
the Prison Management Act ... furloughs and `good time','' he wrote.

<HEAD>Former Spokeswoman Says Keating Directed Misleading News Release</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lincoln S&amp;L Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former spokeswoman for American Continental
Corp. says company Chairman Charles Keating Jr. personally directed
preparation of a press release saying the sale of the company's
troubled Lincoln Savings and Loan was imminent when it really
wasn't.
   Patricia Johnson, a former American Continental public relations
executive, said Tuesday she wrote the release regarding the
proposed sale of the subsidiary at Keating's direction.
   ``He was concerned about the publicity, and the stock was
falling and he asked me for advice,'' Ms. Johnson told The
Associated Press.
   Lincoln Savings, in Irvine, Calif., was taken over by federal
regulators last April. Its failure, which could end up costing
taxpayers as much as $2 billion, and Keating have been the subject
of Congressional hearings and a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation.
   The Feb. 9 press release Ms. Johnson discussed was distributed
the day after American Continental's stock fell 87 cents, to $5.50
a share. Market observers blamed the slide on rumors that Lincoln
Savings' proposed ale to a group of California investors had hit
snags and that American Continental was in financial trouble.
   Following American Continental's announcement that the sale of
Lincoln was ``imminent,'' the stock rose to $6.25 per share and
trading volume increased sharply.
   The sale didn't take place. American Continental filed for
protection under bankruptcy laws on April 14, the day before
Lincoln Savings was taken over by the government. American
Continental stock now trades for 5 cents a share.
   Ms. Johnson told The Arizona Republic she had recommended that a
press release about the sale be issued and that Keating specified
that the word `imminent' had to be used.
   ``He said that he wanted, no matter what else I put in the press
release, to make sure I used the word `imminent,'' Ms. Johnson told
the newspaper.
   Ms. Johnson said she has a draft of the release that has a
notation written in the margin by Keating.
   There was no immediate comment Tuesday from American
Continental; company officials didn't return phone calls. However,
in documents prepared for the Securities Exchange Commission,
American Continental officials have said Ms. Johnson was
responsible for the press release's contents and that the release
was issued in response to news media inquiries.
   ``I didn't create the news, I only disseminated the news,'' Ms.
Johnson said Tuesday. ``I had no reason to believe the information
he had given me was incorrect.''
   Several individuals familiar with American Continental's attempt
to sell Lincoln told the Republic the statement about a sale being
imminent was false.
   ``It was untrue in our judgment,'' said Ernest Leff, one of the
investors interested in buying the thrift. ``I smiled when I saw
Charlie making his flamboyant statements.''
   ``What bothered me was that they lied,'' said William Davis,
chief deputy commissioner of the California Department of Savings
and Loan. ``They knew absolutely dead certain that the sale was not
imminent.''
   Ms. Johnson said she has cooperated with government officials
who contacted her. But she said there was no indication if she'll
be called to testify in any proceedings.
   Ms. Johnson said Keating called her into his office in April and
told her American Continental was dismantling its public relations
unit, which consisted of herself and clerical staff. She said she
didn't receive severance, vacation pay or even compensation for the
day she was told she was dismissed.
   A single mother of three, Ms. Johnson said she does some
public-relations consulting work from her home but has had
difficulty finding work because of her past with American
Continental.

   The El Salvador Sheraton Hotel
bristled with guns Tuesday. Salvadoran soldiers with assault rifles
crouched in the lobby, sharpshooters perched on the roof.
   Armored personnel carriers occupied the parking lot _ instead of
the usual luxury sedans _ and ambulances were parked ominously
nearby. Helicopters and warplanes roared overhead.
   The stretch of swimming pool and lounge chairs between the main
building and the VIP tower, which the guerrillas had taken, was
no-man's land.
   At least four armed U.S. military advisers were trapped on the
fourth floor of the tower. Reports later Tuesday indicated 12 U.S.
Green Berets were believed among those holed up in the hotel, which
is not now part of the U.S.-based hotel group. Guerrillas were on
the floor above, along with guests, and on the floor below.
   A small band of reporters crouched in the entranceway to the
tower, next to the stairwell that the Americans covered with their
M-16 assault rifles. The American advisers said they were under
orders not to shoot unless fired upon.
   It was a bizarre standoff.
   No one wanted to move. No one wanted anyone else to move.
Neither the guerrillas nor the Americans wanted to start shooting.
No one knew if or when the Salvadoran troops might try to take the
tower.
   The reporters crawled over to the edge of the stairwell, calling
down to the guerrillas. None wanted to be interviewed. The
reporters then called down the hallway to the Americans.
   No sudden moves. It was simple for us: Let everyone know who you
are, where you are, what you want.
   One of the Americans agreed to talk. Three reporters were
allowed around the corner, into the hallway.
   ``We would like to leave,'' the soldier said matter-of-factly.
   He asked the reporters to let the U.S. Embassy know they were
trapped in the hotel and asked too that the Salvadoran troops hold
their fire.
   ``We're here because we don't feel we can leave safely,'' he
said.
   The guerrillas and the soldiers had surprised each other in the
hallway shortly after the pre-dawn rebel attack on the hotel, he
said. Both sides ``took up defensive positions.''
   ``We were talking to them, trying to calm them down,'' he said.
   After several hours, the guerrillas moved off the fourth floor.
   The soldier said his group had not fired on the guerrillas. He
cited the rules of engagement for U.S. military personnel in El
Salvador _ ``Unless we're fired upon, we don't fire.''
   The reporters returned to the entranceway.
   Suddenly a young guerrilla appeared on the stairwell from above.
He sat there, in the soldiers' line of fire, looking curiously down
at the reporters, smiling. As the reporters left, he gave a little
wave.
   The neighborhood around the Sheraton, one of the wealthiest in
war-ravaged San Salvador, was a battleground too.
   More than 200 soldiers of the Cavalry Regiment, the National
Police's Panther Battalion and the army's 1st Brigade occupied the
streets.
   Private guards at many of the luxurious mansions surrounded by
barbed wire-topped fences added yet another element of risk to
those foolish enough to venture out.
   Few did. The streets were virtually deserted except for
soldiers, police and a few journalists waving white flags and
crying ``Prensa! Prensa! (Press! Press!)''
   Shots echoed and bullets whistled along the streets throughout
the day, from every direction. Turning a corner or crossing an
intersection was something that required serious consideration.
   A plane armed with rockets and machine guns made several passes
over the hotel and fired at least six rockets.
   They landed about 200 yards from the Sheraton in a ravine
alongside the hotel.
   Dozens of poor people fled the community of shacks along the
ravine.
   ``The rockets blew our roof off,'' said Antonio Herrera, as he
hustled down the street with his sobbing wife and two little girls.
``We were on the floor all afternoon, under our beds.''

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 17 guerrillas and two soldiers
were killed in scattered battles, marking November as the month of
heaviest fighting this year, the military said Tuesday.
   Battles between leftist rebels and security forces since Nov. 1
have claimed the lives of 112 insurgents and 22 soldiers, according
to military statistics.
   The armed forces said the latest casualties came in four clashes
Monday and gave this account:
   Ten guerrillas, including three women, and a soldier were killed
in a gun battle in the mountains near the town of Rosas, 190 miles
southwest of Bogota.
   At Vistahermosa 125 miles east of Bogota, one guerrilla and one
solder were killed.
   Four rebels were killed in fighting near San Pablo, a town 215
miles north of Bogota, and two were slain near Santander de
Quilichao, 220 miles south of the capital.
   The army said the rebels involved in Monday's clashes were from
three organizations _ the Revolutionary Armed Forces, the National
Liberation Army and the Quintin Llame group.
   National police said a city councilman from Paime, a town 45
miles north of Bogota, was killed Monday night in Bogota.
   They said Pablo Enrique Canon was shot as he was leaving a
restaurant. Police said the reason for the attack was not known.

<HEAD>Israelis Riot Following Death of Girl Struck by Truck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of enraged Israelis blocked a Jerusalem
street with garbage cans and burning bushes Tuesday to protest the
death of a Jewish girl struck by a garbage truck driven by an Arab.
   ``Death to the Arabs!'' shouted the rioters in the Shmuel Hanavi
district in northern Jerusalem.
   Police said the 7-year-old girl was killed instantly when she
was hit by the truck driven by a city employee.
   ``The driver was an Arab. .... Somebody saw him going wild on
the road, and others say he pulled the girl and ran over her,
shouting `Allahu Akbar' (God is Great),'' a man from Shmuel Hanavi
told Israel radio. He was not identified.
   City police chief Arye Bibi told reporters, ``The driver indeed
was an Arab, but it had nothing to do with the accident. The driver
was arrested and his interrogation raised no possibility at all
that he did it for political reasons.
   ``He works for the municipality, he was driving here and hit the
girl.''
   Israel radio quoted police officials as saying the girl
apparently ran into the road from behind a parked bus and the truck
driver did not see her.
   Residents of Shmuel Hanavi, a working-class district, have held
street demonstrations in the past to protest Arab attacks on
Israelis in the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising. They stoned
Arab-owned vehicles, injuring some motoritsts, but the district has
been quiet in recent months.
   In the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers
shot and wounded at least six Palestinians, Arab doctors said.
   The army command confirmed two wounded and said the victims were
in a ``suspicious looking car'' near the West Bank town of Jenin
and ignored orders by soldiers to stop.
   The troops shouted warnings and fired in the air before shooting
at the car, the army said. It did not identify the victims but said
they were wanted by security forces and were taken to an Israeli
hospital.
   Arab reporters identified the two as Ihsan Moani, 20, and Yusef
Al Heid, 20.
   At least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire
during the uprising. The violence also has claimed 42 Israeli lives.

<HEAD>D.C. Appropriations Signed After Abortion Provisions Dropped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday signed a $3.4
billion budget bill for the District of Columbia after Congress
stripped from the measure an abortion provision that had provoked
two vetoes.
   The measure, for the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1,
includes the federal government's annual $435 million contribution
to the district government. The rest of the funds are paid by local
taxpayers but must be appropriated by Congress before the D.C.
government can spend anything.
   Bush on Monday night vetoed the D.C. appropriations bill for the
second time because of abortion provisions that would not have
restricted the use of the taxpayer-paid money, while limiting
federal Medicaid funds to abortions to save the life of the mother.
   Until last year, the district had been funding
abortion-on-demand for poor women with locally raised money.
   Bush exercised similar vetoes on two other measures over
abortion issues.
   One was a bill providing funds for the Department of Health and
Human Services which would have expanded use of Medicaid funds to
cover abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest.
   Congress sustained Bush's veto, then sent him a new bill without
the abortion liberalization provison which he signed.
   Bush also vetoed a foreign aid bill that contained a provision
giving money to a United Nations population control program. The
program, in turn, supported a Chinese program under which abortions
were sometimes utilized.
   Congress removed that provision from the measure and sent it
back to Bush for his expected signature.

<HEAD>Senate Condemns Violence in El Salvador</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Salvador</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 5-8: ``The comments,'' with additional comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 99 to 0 Tuesday for a
resolution condemning continuing violence on all sides in El
Salvador and vowing to reconsider U.S. aid if the killers of six
Jesuit priests are not brought to justice.
   ``Both the FMLN (leftist guerrillas) and the Salvadoran
government must take strong action to end the violence that both
sides seem to have taken against the innocent population,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The non-binding resolution came a day after Congress refused to
attach any restrictions on this year's $85 million in U.S. military
aid to El Salvador, heeding President Bush's argument that such a
move would undercut the new government of rightist president
Alfredo Cristiani.
   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., noted that ``votes
like yesterday's can be misinterpreted,'' and added, ``This
resolution makes clear that we deplore all violence in El Salvador,
whether it comes from the extreme right or the communist left.''
   The comments were indicative of a growing restiveness in
Congress with U.S. policy toward El Salvador.
   ``The question isn't what we think of the rebels,'' said Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., whose Appropriations subcommittee writes
foreign aid legislation.
   ``The question is what we think of the ability of the existing
policy to succeed. The very fact that the rebels have been able to
do this after ten years of supporting the Salvador government
demonstrates to me that that government is not nearly as in control
of the military situation as they have indicated.''
   Added Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.: ``The extremists on both sides
are driving this country into the sea. And in the meantime, U.S.
citizens are starting to get affected by it. The president needs to
personally get involved to get a cease-fire in place.''
   The Senate resolution was similar to a resolution passed a day
earlier by the House, and stated ``unequivocally'' that if the
government does not make a good-faith effort to apprehend and
prosecute the murderers of six Jesuit priests and two apparent
witnesses, ``the Congress will carefully review and consider the
question of aid to El Salvador.''
   ``The military and those who may have been involved in some of
these violent acts should understand that ... we're not necessarily
going to be writing a blank check in perpetuity, and it's extremely
important that President Cristiani understand this,'' said Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   Congress ``may find it necessary to condition or curtail''
future Salvadoran aid, he said.
   The resolution also asked that the Bush administration report to
Congress by Feb. 20 on the status of the investigation into those
deaths.
   Dole said Tuesday's guerrilla attack on a San Salvador hotel
reaffirmed Congress' decision not to slap limits on the military
aid for Cristiani's government.
   But the resolution also gave those who voted against
restrictions on U.S. aid a day earlier a chance to vote for
language deploring violence, in the face of heavy lobbying and
public protests by church and other groups opposed to U.S. aid.
   It was approved unanimously with Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, not
voting.
   As the Senate vote proceeded, police forcibly removed several
protesters from the visitors' galleries who began shouting comments
againt U.S. policy. The entire gallery was cleared for the second
time this week, something that has happened only twice before in
this century.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., objected to the action, saying, ``It's
giving in to a few malcontents to clear everybody out because there
are a few disturbers.''
   U.S. Capitol Police said three demonstrators were arrested on
charges of disrupting Congress and demonstrating within the
Capitol. Each charge is punishable by a maximum fine of $500 and or
six months in jail.

<TEXT>
   A Yale lecturer's angry letter to a
prominent Harvard psychiatrist attacking him for his comments on
the gang rape of a jogger in New York City has led to charges and
countercharges of racism.
   The latest salvo was fired this month in the Yale Daily News,
the student newspaper. Alexander Theroux wrote a column defending
his letter to Dr. Alvin Poussaint and accusing the psychiatrist of
trying to have him fired by the Ivy League school.
   Theroux sent the letter to Poussaint after hearing him
interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' about six
young men accused of raping and badly beating the woman jogging in
Central Park on April 19. The woman was released from a
rehabilitation center in Wallingford only last Wednesday.
   Theroux said in an interview last week that he described the
attackers as ``monkeys'' in his letter because he felt the attack
was animal-like.
   Poussaint, who is also a consultant to television's ``The Cosby
Show,'' is black. Theroux, a novelist and lecturer in English who
said he is a friend of the victim, is white.
   Poussaint, viewing the term ``monkeys'' as a racist remark,
passed the letter on to a Boston Globe columnist after failing to
get what he felt was a proper response from Yale. He said he
believed the letter warranted an apology.
   Theroux said the subsequent column in the Globe transformed ``an
angry letter into a racial one,'' and prompted him to respond that
he was being treated in a racist manner.
   Theroux said his choice of the word ``monkey'' may have been
injudicious, but he did not use the term as a racial slur.
   ``It wasn't _ and isn't _ a racial term to me,'' he wrote in the
Yale Daily News. ``It could have been pigs, dogs, scumfish. They
had behaved literally worse than animals.''
   Theroux said he wrote Poussaint because he was outraged by the
psychiatrist's description of the young men as having been angry,
which he viewed as a partial defense of the woman's attackers.
   The Yale lecturer said he told Poussaint that he could create a
backlash in the white community by defending such people. ``My
point was to tell him he was an irresponsible idiot,'' he said.
   Poussaint said that in the television interview he said that
``any kids who attack and brutalize a woman this way must have some
terrible anger and rage inside them.''
   ``It was not an attempt on my part to excuse these kids'
behavior,'' he said in an interview last week. ``That would be
absurd.''
   Poussaint said he didn't think Theroux ``could be that
unsophisticated not to understand what the term `monkey' meant. He
picked a common term used in derision of blacks.''
   The Harvard psychiatrist wrote the chairman of Yale's English
department, Richard H. Brodhead, to call his attention to the
letter. Poussaint said he also sent copies of his letter to Yale
President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. and the university's affirmative
action officer.
   The letter was written on Yale stationery. Poussaint said he had
thought it might be a forgery because of its tone, and that if it
were not, the English department should question its author.
   The letter ``raised questions about professionalism and whether
a person holding such views was appropriate to be a teacher of
black students,'' Poussaint said.
   Theroux, who is in his second one-year appointment to the
English department, was chastised by the chairman for using Yale
stationery to write the personal letter but was not subjected to
any other action.
   For a university to get into the position of firing someone for
saying something others may find distasteful ``is to do the work of
censorship,'' said Brodhead.

<TEXT>
   Sen. John McCain wrote the Senate Ethics
Committee on Tuesday that he never acted improperly on behalf of a
collapsing savings bank whose top official gave him campaign money
and use of an airplane.
   ``I have every confidence that you and the committee will
determine that there has been no improper conduct on my part and
that you will clear my name,'' the Arizona Republican wrote Ethics
Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala. and Vice Chairman Warren
Rudman, R-N.H.
   McCain is one of five senators who received campaign money from
Charles H. Keating Jr., who headed Lincoln Savings and Loan, of
Irvine, Calif., when it collapsed, becoming the nation's largest
thrift failure.
   The ethics panel had written to the five, asking whether their
intervention for Keating and his bank with federal regulators was
prompted by Keating's campaign contributions. All have denied any
wrongdoing. The Ethics Committee has hired an outside counsel to
gather information in the case.
   McCain said he always represents constituents _ Keating lives in
Arizona _ when they have ``a valid complaint'' and denied his help
is ever based on their campaign contributions.
   McCain admitted, however, that he inadvertently did not pay in a
timely fashion for flights on Keating's corporate plane _ although
he eventually discovered he paid twice for some flights.
   McCain received $112,000 from Keating, his family members and
business associates from 1982-86, although the senator has
contended that some of them might have contributed to his campaigns
independently of Keating.
   McCain and three other senators met with then-Chairman Edwin
Gray, of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, on April 2, 1987 to
discuss the board's investigation of Lincoln.
   One week later, McCain joined four senators in a meeting with
the regulators who were conducting the examination.
   The senator said he attended the meetings after complaints from
Keating, and after receiving favorable reports on the bank from the
large accounting firm of Arthur Young; and from Alan Greenspan, now
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board but a consultant for Keating
when he wrote a letter on the bank's behalf.
   Keating complained in March 1987 that the examination of Lincoln
was taking too long, and that bank board examiners were being
unreasonably critical of Lincoln's investments.
   Arthur Young, which was working for Keating, supported his
contention. The Greenspan letter, written in 1985 but given to
McCain two years later, endorsed Lincoln's investment policies and
its management.
   McCain, noting that the bank's parent company, American
Continental Corp. was based in Arizona, said, ``I felt reasonable
questions were being raised'' about whether the bank was receiving
``fair and equitable treatment by the bank board.''
   McCain told the ethics panel that after the San Francisco-based
bank examiners informed the senators they had uncovered potentially
serious legal and financial problems at Lincoln, he ``was totally
satisfied'' that the examination was fair and never intervened
again.

<TEXT>
   The government announced on Tuesday the
final results of the presidential election a week ago and confirmed
a conservative businessman and Marxist labor leader will be in the
Dec. 17 runoff.
   The announcement was just a formality. Earlier results had shown
conservative Fernando Collor de Mello and former union leader Luis
Inacio Lula da Silva received the most votes in the Nov. 15
balloting. Both fell far short of winning a majority, forcing the
runoff.
   Collor de Mello of the National Reconstruction Party led the
21-candidate field with 20,609,009 votes, or 28.52 percent, after
more than 82 million ballots were counted by the Superior Electoral
Court.
   Da Silva, of the Workers' Party, received 11,622,673 votes for
16.08 percent, according to Electoral Court spokesman Irineu
Tamanini.
   The main interest during the vote count was which of two leftist
candidates would be the No. 2 vote getter and face Collor de Mello
in the runoff.
   Leonel Brizola of the leftist Democratic Labor Party finished a
close third with 11,168,228 votes or 15.45 percent.
   Tamanini said more than 17 percent of the voters cast blank
ballots _ a high rate for Brazil. Voting is mandatory for
Brazilians aged 18 to 69.
   The winner of the second-round balloting will be sworn in March
15 for a five-year term. President Jose Sarney by law was not
eligible for election.

   The Food and Drug Administration warned
consumers Tuesday not to eat smoked salmon products packed by Royal
Food Enterprises of Chicago because bacterial contamination could
make them ill.
   The agency said a voluntary recall had not been effective
because some of the company's brokers and wholesalers had failed to
notify retail outlets.
   The bacteria involved, Lysteria monocytogenes, cause
listeriosis. This disease, characterized by flu-like symptoms,
presents little risk to healthy people but can be life-threatening
to the seriously ill, people with impaired immune systems, fetuses
and the newborn.
   FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said he had no reports of illness from
eating the salmon.
   Here are the products involved.

   President Bush vetoed the annual bill
authorizing operations of the State Department late Tuesday and
Congress scrambled to pass a version acceptable to the president
before adjourning for the year.
   Bush objected to a provision that officials said would tie the
government's hands in conducting foreign policy. The provision,
stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, would have imposed criminal
penalties on any official convicted of using U.S. aid to pressure
foreign governments into carrying out polices contrary to U.S. law.
   The House immediately passed by voice vote a new, ``clean''
version of the bill with the offending provision stripped out, and
sent it to the Senate in the hope of winning approval before
Congress adjourned for the year.
   The measure authorizes the spending of up to $9.7 billion over
the next two years, and includes a series of trade sanctions
against China as a protest against its brutal crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last spring.
   The China sanctions include suspension of risk insurance for
companies doing business in China, suspension of trade assistance,
a freeze on exports of U.S. satellites, a halt to sales of
controlled munitions and an end to sale of certain nuclear
materials and components.
   The bill also provides authority for the administration to spend
up to $16 million to begin U.S. government-sponsored television
broadcasts to Cuba, modeled after Radio Marti, a government
broadcasting effort which has operated for the past several years.
   Also included are $910 million over two years for refugee and
migration assistance, $2 billion for the U.S. Information Agency
and $600 million for the Board for International Broadcasting.
   The provision to which Bush objected would ``severely hamper the
conduct of U.S. foreign policy and would impose an unfair and
unreasonable burden on our diplomats and on the conduct of our
diplomacy and intelligence activities,'' according to a White House
letter to Capitol Hill.
   While Congress backed down from the language, the confrontation
damaged relations with some White House allies on Capitol Hill and
left lingering anger at White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray.
   ``I frankly think it's left some scars that are very deep with
people up here,'' Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said after talks
aimed at finding a compromise broke down.
   Congressional proponents of the provision took some solace in
the passage of a separate foreign aid bill which contained similar
language, without the criminal penalties.

<HEAD>Premier Says Hungary's Foreign Debt Larger Than Thought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Miklos Nemeth told Parliament
Tuesday that Hungary's true foreign debt is $20 billion, $3 billion
more than previously reported.
   Nemeth told stunned legislators that false figures on the debt
had been published for years because the communist leadership
feared an admission of the correct amount would endanger talks with
foreign creditors.
   Last month Parliament adopted laws and constitutional amendments
to prepare for a democratic transformation that includes the first
free elections in more than 40 years and the establishment of a
Hungarian Republic without communist domination.
   The Communist Party was disbanded, replaced by a
Western-oriented Socialist Party that promised to surrender power
if it loses elections scheduled for next June at latest.
   Nemeth said while Hungarians greeted those changes with
jubilation other reforms needed to revitalize the economy probably
will lead to lower living standards and more unemployment.
   ``The decisions that need to be made now will not be applauded
by tens of thousands of people,'' he told Parliament in a
nationally televised session.
   ``Wanting democracy, the majority supported the dismantling of
the party state, but the new changes will be more divisive.''
   There have been calls for elections to be held before June so
that opposition groups can elect represtentatives to the new
legisalature, still controlled by deputies who had been from the
ruling Communist Party.
   One legislator, Gyoergy Banffy, said Monday Parliament should
dissolve itself at its session next month.
   Elections would have to be called within three months after
Parliament was dissolved and Banffy proposed they be scheduled by
March 11. His motion is to be discussed by the legislatore later
this week.
   Nemeth said until the elections his government will work to
``put national interest ahead of everything else.''
   He said that would include a new relationship with the Warsaw
Pact military alliance and the Soviet-led Eastern trading bloc
Comecon.
   He did not elaborate but Hungary has increasingly been turning
toward the West for trade and often has criticized Comecon as
ineffective.
   Hungarian leaders have pledged to remain in the Warsaw Pact but
advocate greater sovereignty within the alliance.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors in the Wedtech Corp. scandal
unsealed an indictment Tuesday charging a former Army employee with
taking more than $569,000 in bribes from officials of the
now-defunct defense contractor.
   The indictment said the defendant, Gordon Osgood Sr., reviewed
Wedtech's performance on Army contracts while he was a civilian
employee at the Army's Tank Automotive Command in Warren, Mich.
   Prosecutors allege Osgood received more than $569,000 in illegal
payoffs from Wedtech officials between 1980 and 1985 in exchange
for favorable performance evaluations, confidential Army contract
information and help with receiving advance payments. The company
also allegedly provided Osgood, 66, of Romeo, Mich., with use of a
leased Mercedes-Benz in 1984 and 1985.
   Osgood's attorney, Robert Gray, refused to discuss the charges,
saying his client hadn't yet been informed about them.
   Osgood was charged in a 13-count indictment with racketeering,
conspiracy, accepting bribes and illegal gratuities, conspiracy and
tax evasion. He is scheduled for arraignment in federal court Nov.
30.
   The newest charges were approved by a federal grand jury in
April but were kept secret until Tuesday, said U.S. Attorney Otto
Obermaier.
   Evidence at earlier trials showed Wedtech, once a small South
Bronx machine shop, grew into a multimillion-dollar military
contractor through various bribe schemes. The company collapsed in
December 1986 amid allegations of corruption.
   Among those convicted in previous Wedtech cases were U.S. Rep.
Robert Garcia, D-Bronx, and his wife, former Rep. Mario Biaggi and
E. Robert Wallach, a close friend of ex-U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese.

<TEXT>
   The former chairman of Florida's Democratic Party
was indicted Tuesday on federal charges he schemed to bribe
Dominican Republic officials to release airplanes confiscated for
drug trafficking.
   Alfredo Duran, an attorney who headed the party from 1976 to
1980, was accused of conspiracy to violate the federal Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.
   A former Dominican general, Joaquin Pou, 54, and his aide, Jose
Guasch, 43, were arrested in the case Nov. 5, and are free on bond.
   Duran's attorney, Donald Bierman, said his client would turn
himself in to a federal magistrate Wednesday.
   If convicted, each of the three men face maximum sentences of
five years in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   The federal grand jury's indictment announced by U.S. Attorney
Dexter Lehtinen accuses the three of seeking to bribe Dominican
officials to obtain the release of two planes by the Caribbean
island country.
   Duran, 53, strongly denied the charges in a news conference
shortly after the indictment was announced.
   ``I am shocked and disappointed that this charge has been
made,'' he said in a statement. ``I have voluntarily taken lie
detector tests ... and have totally passed those tests on all
issues raised in this matter.''
   State Democratic Party spokeswoman Gayle Andrews said she had no
doubt the indictment was political, was perhaps an effort to win
the judgeship left vacant by the impeachment of former U.S.
District Judge Alcee Hastings.
   ``You have to be a blind man not to see what's happening here,''
Andrews said. ``It's obviously political. Mr. Lehtinen wants to
make a name for himself.''
   Before being appointed U.S. attorney, Lehtinen was a GOP state
senator from the Miami area. His wife, Republican Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, was elected to Congress Nov. 7.
   Dianne Cossin, a spokeswoman for Lehtinen, said, ``Any
accusation that a grand jury indictment is motivated by a political
agenda is false, unwarranted and shows a lack of understanding of
how our legal system works.
   ``Today's indictment was returned by a federal grand jury that
considered the evidence. They took into consideration much
information gathered by law enforcement agencies,'' she said.
   According to the indictment, the three men had to pay to falsify
documents to hide the planes' drug connections and ease their
release.
   The indictment said Pou was paid $8,000 to smooth the release of
one of the aircraft.
   Duran held $12,000 in escrow, and $5,000 in cash to be paid
later for that plane, the indictment said. The deal involving the
second plane was never consummated, according to an affidavit by
U.S. Treasury agent Gary J. Lang.
   Robert Gurin, who was named in a federal arrest warrant when Pou
and Guasch were picked up, was not indicted Tuesday. He has
reportedly been cooperating with authorities in the case.
   Gurin headed AEA Aircraft Recovery in Coral Gables, which
specialized in recovering planes for owners.
   According to Lang's affidavit, the government investigated Gurin
because of allegations he had bribed high-ranking military
officials in the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean countries
to recover drug planes.
   The government used an informant to pose as an agent for the
owner of a plane seized by the Dominican military.
   Gurin told the informant that Duran would channel the money to
generals of the Dominican military through his escrow account, the
affidavit said.
   Between February and October, the informant met with Gurin, Pou,
Guasch and Duran to iron out the bribery details, the affidavit
said. Most of the meetings were tape-recorded or videotaped by FBI
and U.S. Customs officials.

   President Bush signed into law a $14.6 billion
foreign aid bill Tuesday night that includes the first cash in a
promised three-year aid program for Poland and Hungary.
   The measure included $533 million in new aid for Poland and
Hungary, aid which has become politically popular because of the
wave of economic and political reform sweeping Eastern Europe.
   About $293 million would be in cash, including support for new
private enterprise and to stabilize Poland's currency; the rest
would come in trade and investment insurance.
   It also includes $85 million in unfettered military aid for El
Salvador, where a weeklong spate of intense warfare has prompted
congressional calls for a re-examination of U.S. policy.
   As usual, more than one-third of U.S. aid goes to the two
parties to the Camp David peace accord, Israel and Egypt. Israel is
due to receive $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in
economic aid, while Egypt will get $1.3 billion in military aid and
$815 million in economic assistance.
   Other aid in the bill is earmarked for the Philippines, which
would get $160 million as the U.S. share of a new international
assistance program; Turkey, with $500 million in military aid;
Greece, with $350 million in military aid; $230 million in economic
aid for Pakistan; $440 million in economic aid to be shared among
the four Central American democracies as the administration sees
fit; and $20 million for an economic development fund for Northern
Ireland.
   The administration agreed to accept one item it had argued
vociferously against, a section written by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
that would bar the administration from using aid money to buy
support from other countries for policies the United States could
not legally carry out itself.
   Agreement came after Obey rose on the House floor and announced
the section was not intended to tie the hands of administration
officials carrying out their normal diplomatic duties, but was only
to bar explicit ``quid pro quo'' deals with other countries to
carry out prohibited activities.
   A similar provision in the bill authorizing State Department
activities prompted a veto by Bush Tuesday night.
   The bill survived a major battle over whether the United States
should reverse a five-year policy and renew contributions to the
United Nations Population Fund, which carries out family planning
programs in third-world countries.
   Pressed by anti-abortion forces, Bush vetoed an earlier version
of the bill over a provision giving the U.N. agency $15 million,
and the section was later stripped from the bill. Opponents noted
the agency operates in China, which they contended forces women to
have abortions to enforce its one-child-per-family policy.

   In their third straight day of protest,
chanting, yelling demonstrators outraged over U.S. support of El
Salvador clashed Tuesday with police and about 130 were arrested.
   With helmeted San Francisco police standing behind them, the
protesters held hands and linked arms to form human barricades at
entrances to the Federal Building.
   Some of the building's 6,000 workers and people headed for
court, fought their way through the protestors to get into the
20-story building.
   At the ramp to the building's basement garage, federal and city
police stormed through demonstrator lines to escort workers into
the building. Occasionally, federal police grabbed demonstrators
and dragged them onto the ramp where they were arrested.
   Lt. Frank O'Bando of Federal Protective Services estimated about
100 people were arrested by his officers and scheduled to go before
a U.S. magistrate on disturbance and assault charges.
   San Francisco Deputy Police Chief Frank Reed estimated 30 others
were arrested by city police on similar charges.
   About 135 protesters were arrested Monday as they blocked
entrances at the Federal Building. Hundreds marched through San
Francisco's Mission District on Sunday to protest the violence in
El Salvador and U.S. aid there.

   Icy wind blasted down trees and power lines from the Great Lakes
to North Carolina and whipped more than a foot of snow into squalls
that stopped drivers cold Tuesday in northern New England.
   Two forest fires sparked by downed power lines burned out of
control in Virginia. The weather was blamed for seven deaths.
   A tree toppled by gusting winds struck and killed a principal as
she was getting out of her car Tuesday at her elementary school in
Montclair, N.J.
   ``She spent a lot of years getting to know these kids and their
families. It's just hard to imagine her not being there,''
Superintendent Mary Lee Fitzgerald said in tribute to Agnes Bulmer,
60.
   A security guard died in Newark, N.J., after a fence blown off
by the wind severed his foot.
   A Baltimore woman died Monday when a warehouse fell on her home.
Slick roads were blamed for four deaths in two separate highway
accidents in western Pennsylvania. In one, two young men died when
their pickup slammed into a tractor-trailer and in the other, a
9-year-old child and a New York woman were killed when the woman
lost control of her car and slammed into a van carrying six
children.
   The wind and cold were backlashes of an intense storm that
crossed New York and New England on Monday night and headed into
the Canadian maritime provinces.
   The National Weather Service posted blizzard warnings for New
Hampshire and most of Maine, where snow accumulations of 15 inches
were expected in some areas.
   Bangor International Airport shut down in Maine and Bangor
postal workers suspended deliveries.
   The weather service reported gusts of up to 56 mph in Augusta,
Maine, and 45 mph in Portsmouth, N.H. Gusts to 47 mph were reported
in Burlington, Vt.
   State police in Maine said jackknifed and stalled
tractor-trailers were blocking many roads. Three sections of
interstate were closed temporarily in the Portland and Augusta
areas.
   As many as 40,000 customers of Maine's largest utility lost
electricity, as did thousands of others in New Hampshire.
   Winds up to 86 mph Monday night knocked out power to at least
271,500 homes across Pennsylvania, including 97,000 in the
Philadelphia area, utility officials said. Crews were working to
restore service to more than 78,420 customers Tuesday afternoon.
   In the New York area, gusts knocked out power even as utilities
dispatched hundreds of workers to fix more than 120,000 outages
from a storm Monday night.
   That wind storm slung a parked jetliner into a fuel truck at
Newark International Airport and badly damaged three jets at John
F. Kennedy International Airport, authorities said.
   Long Island Lighting Co. spokesman Jim Lois said the utility
still had 28,750 customers without power Tuesday afternoon.
   ``Some of the problems are severe _ heavy tree limbs breaking
off, and in some cases whole trees uprooted. We've had
hurricane-force winds for the last 12 to 18 hours,'' said Lois.
   Utility workers also were restoring power Tuesday in Ohio,
Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and North
Carolina.
   In Forked River, N.J., 40 mph gusts reversed the flow of water
to the Oyster Creek Nuclear Station on Tuesday. Plant operators
reduced power and reported an ``unusual event,'' the lowest
emergency classification.
   In Newark, N.J., gusts to 50 mph spread a fire across three
residential blocks, leaving at least 35 families homeless,
officials said.
   Sixty miles north, wind blew away part of the roof of Beekman
Elementary School in Poughquag, N.Y., just 20 miles from the school
where seven children were killed last week in a tornado.
   In New Jersey, high winds damaged 22 homes, a business and 14
cars in Seaside Park on the coast and blew two homes off their
foundations.
   Downed power lines sparked more than 50 forest fires Monday
night in Virginia, two of which remained out of control Tuesday,
state and federal officials said.
   The largest fire, 250 acres, was in Jefferson National Forest,
said Terry Seyden of the U.S. Forest Service. He said he did not
expect containment until the wind abated. A 100-acre fire burned in
the Shenandoah National Park's Furnance Mountain area, said Steve
Rives, a park spokesman.

   Police fanned out across India as voters
in the world's most populous democracy began casting ballots
Wednesday to decide the fate of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his
beleaguered Congress Party.
   More than 100,000 paramilitary troopers were deployed to
reinforce local police to prevent violence that has claimed 39
lives since the election for a new Parliament was announced a month
ago.
   Most of the victims were campaign workers who were stabbed,
stoned, shot or hacked to death by supporters of rival parties.
   Late Tuesday, the health minister of western Gujarat state was
fatally stabbed while getting into his car after addressing a
Congress Party rally in Hatmatiana, a village 600 miles southwest
of New Delhi. The assailant escaped.
   The minister, Vallabhbhai Patel, died early Wednesday while
undergoing surgery, United News of India reported.
   Gandhi, in one of his last campaign speeches, told a
middle-of-the-night rally at Kanakapura in southern Karnataka state
that only his Congress Party could give the nation the stability it
needs.
   At stake are 524 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, the
decision-making lower house of Parliament.
   Voters in only 15 of India's 24 states and five of its seven
federally governed territorities cast their ballots Wednesday. The
rest of the country goes to the polls Friday and Sunday. Results
are not to be announced until late Sunday or Monday.
   Elections in India are spread over several days because of the
country's size, which compounds communications difficulties and
spreads security forces thin.
   Authorities in eastern Orissa state were using trained pigeons
to carry messages from remote villages to the state police.
   More than 6,000 candidates are running for seats in the Lok
Sabha. Voting was postponed indefinitely in Assam state because
electoral rolls were incomplete and balloting was delayed in
several constituencies because of the deaths of candidates.
   The National Front, a coalition of five opposition parties, made
government corruption the heart of its campaign. The coalition
leader, who is expected to be prime minister if it wins, is
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, formerly one of Gandhi's most trusted
ministers.
   A National Front victory would loosen a dynastic family grip on
Indian politics handed down from Rajiv's grandfather, Jawaharlal
Nehru, through his mother, Indira. It could splinter the party that
has governed India for all but 29 months since independence from
Britain in 1947.
   Nearly 500 million of the 880 million people are eligible to
vote. Because the literacy rate is only 36 percent, a voter marks a
candidate's symbol on the ballot.
   At least 3.7 million government officials will supervise 600,000
voting stations.
   The outcome will be determined in the Hindi-speaking heartland
of northern India that stretches from Rajasthan in the west across
Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to Bihar in the east.
Nearly half the Lok Sabha is elected from what is called the Hindi
Belt.
   Most Indians see the election as a referendum on Gandhi's record
since he became prime minister after two Sikh bodyguards
assassinated his mother on Oct. 31, 1984.
   Less than two months later, the Congress Party won an
unprecedented 415 seats in the lower house, which gave it a mandate
to change tradition-bound India and attack its ancient problems of
poverty and illiteracy.
   Gandhi liberalized the economy and opened the door to foreign
investment, but failed to reform the notoriously inefficient
bureaucracy or clean up politics and the Congress Party.
   Ram Kumar, a 79-year-old bricklayer in Agra, said: ``The
Congress candidates are thieves, but I'll vote for them anyway
because I'm afraid the opposition will be even more corrupt.''
   Opposition leaders built their anti-corruption campaign around a
$1.4 billion contract with the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors for
400 army artillery pieces. They and several Indian newspapers say
Bofors paid up to $50 million in kickbacks.
   The prime minister denied any wrongdoing and no evidence has
been presented that links him or his family to the deal. Congress
Party officials retaliated by accusing opposition leaders of
corruption, nepotism and murder.
   Bofors has become the rallying cry against the corruption that
plagues daily life in India, where a bribe usually is needed to get
a telephone, a job or even into school.
   Once, in 1977, the Congress Party was beaten. Factionalism
destroyed that government after 29 months, however, and Congress
won the 1980 elections.

   National drug policy director William Bennett
plans to designate five areas as major drug trafficking areas
eligible for extra federal aid, an administration source said
Tuesday night.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said four of
the chosen areas are centered on Miami, Los Angeles, New York and
Houston. The fifth area consists of various parts of the
southwestern border with Mexico.
   Under last year's drug law, Bennett may single out such areas
for special emphasis.
   Administration officials have talked of making $40 million
available to those areas, but the source said it was not clear yet
how the extra money would be divided or what it would be used for.
   The areas will be identified in the second draft of the national
anti-drug strategy to be reviewed soon by the National Security
Council and the Domestic Policy Council.
   That strategy is to be submitted to Congress early next year
when President Bush submits his proposed budget for the 1991 fiscal
year beginning next Oct. 1.

   U.S. soldiers withdrew from positions in
front of an American military hospital Tuesday after two days of
protests by Panamanian civilians and government officials.
   There was a brief scuffle between six soldiers and 30 Panamanian
demonstrators when the soldiers tried to remove protesters who had
walked between two armored personnel carriers.
   No injuries were reported and shortly after the shoving match
U.S. and Panamanian representatives negotiated a settlement.
   It provided for the U.S. troops to withdraw with Panamanian
military police taking responsibility for the street between the
Gorgas Hospital and a Panamanian Health Ministry building.
   U.S. armored personnel carriers and coils of barbed wire around
the hospital had blocked access to the Panamanian offices.
   Shouting ``Gringos go home!'' and ``Gringo animal, get out of
the canal!'' more than 100 members of the pro-government ``Dignity
Battalions'' had hoisted Panamanian flags outside the hospital.
   The battalions support Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
commander of Panama's Defense Forces who controls the government.
   Mercedes Morris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command,
said American soldiers were stationed in front of the hospital
after Panamanian Defense Forces refused to increase security
following bomb threats.
   A spokesman for the protesters said the U.S. servicemen were
posted at the hospital because the hospital was being used to treat
people wounded in the civil war in El Salvador. The Southern
Command denied Salvadorans were being flown in for treatment.
   The Panamanian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday the U.S. deployment
was ``a powerful affront to our territorial sovereignty, a flagrant
violation'' of the 1977 Panama Canal treaties that give Panama
control of the waterway at the end of 1999.
   Washington has been pressing for Noriega's removal since he was
indicted in February 1988 by federal grand juries in Florida on
drug trafficking charges.
   Noriega has denied the charges and accuses the United States of
trying to renege on the canal treaties.

   A truck driver who was fired Monday by the
printing company where he'd worked for several years returned
Tuesday afternoon and shot two former co-workers with a shotgun,
critically wounding them, officials said.
   Stanley Walton, 32, of suburban Decatur was arrested shortly
after the shootings at a Williams Printing Co. plant and charged
with four counts of aggravated assault.
   One man was shot in the back while the other was shot in the
abdomen with a 20-gauge shotgun, said police Sgt. Donny Agan.
   John Lewis Partlow, 49, of Atlanta and James T. Stanley, 52, of
Mableton underwent surgery Tuesday night at Piedmont Hospital, said
supervisor Eileen Houser. Both were in critical condition.
   John R. Pope, the company's executive vice president, said the
victims were not Walton's supervisors.
   Walton was fired for violating company rules, Pope said, but
would not be more specific.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes More Than $377,000 in Fines for New York Telephone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The federal government, accusing New York
Telephone Co. of not telling employees what hazardous materials
they were working with, on Tuesday proposed $377,240 in fines for
the company.
   If the fines are levied, they would be the highest the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration has ever imposed on a
telecommunications company, the agency said.
   ``It's a very widespread case,'' said Edward Jerome, an official
at OSHA's Albany regional office. ``The company has the ... health
and safety resources to get into compliance.''
   The company will challenge the fines, said New York Telephone
spokesman Tony Pappas. ``This company has always been interested in
safety,'' Pappas said. ``A willful violation is not something the
company would do.''
   OSHA said it cited New York Telephone for 16 serious violations,
62 willful violations and two other violations. The citations
resulted from 26 surprise visits to New York Telephone workplaces
around the state in July.
   OSHA claimed the company knowingly violated OSHA standards by
failing to maintain safety information for each hazardous chemical
used at workplaces and failing to provide employees with
information and training on proper handling of hazardous materials,
according to Jerome.
   The agency also accused the company of failing to properly test
employees for possible exposure to lead and failing to properly
store compressed gas cylinders.
   OSHA said it found employees at an office in Schenectady were
not trained to deal with organic solvents, compressed gases, leaded
solder and CRC 5-56, a petroleum distillate in an aerosol can.
   ``We are not alleging employees were overexposed to these
materials,'' said Anthony DeSiervi, OSHA assistant regional
administrator in New York City.
   However, Marsha Love, regional health and safety director for
the Communications Workers of America, said the union was concerned
about what its members might have been exposed to.
   She said the company had eight years to implement safety
measures under state law that was superseded by federal law in
August 1988.
   The union has been talking to the company for some time about
safety concerns, Love said. She said the CWA finally went to OSHA
in July, and the agency began inspecting New York Telephone
workplaces.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is studying
suggestions for ``revolutionary changes'' in America's military _

   Amid the long-range budget planning, a senior Pentagon official

billion spending level.
   ``It could be that bad,'' the official said. ``It could be that
we have to cut that much.''
   Cheney planned to hold a second day of meetings today with
Pentagon chiefs to pore over proposed wide-ranging cutbacks for
1992 to 1994, which some Pentagon insiders say could be the most

   Machinists ended their 48-day strike against

   More than eight in 10 Boeing workers voted in favor of the

Workers.
   The strike against the world's largest builder of commercial
jets affected more than 57,000 workers in nine states. It came as
the company had a record backlog of aircraft orders of more than a
decade in part because airlines are replacing their aging fleets.
   ``The 1989 strike will be remembered as the strongest and best

   Hepatitis B, a blood-borne disease that can
cause fatal liver cancer, is a much greater worldwide health threat
than AIDS, but U.S. doctors are doing little to promote use of a
vaccine against the illness, an infectious disease expert says.
   There are 20 to 30 times more carriers of the hepatitis B virus
than there are people infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS, Dr. Sanford F. Kuvin, vice
chairman of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said
Monday.
   ``Hepatitis B is the most important blood-borne disease in the
world today, and that includes AIDS,'' Kuvin said in an interview
at the fourth National Forum on AIDS and Hepatitis B. ``There are
almost 300 million carriers of the hepatitis B virus in the world
today and there are about 10 to 15 million carriers of the HIV
virus.''
   Among carriers of the hepatitis B virus, 25 percent, or about 60
million, will die from primary liver cancer, he said. An additional
15 percent, or about 45 million, will die of cirrhosis, another
liver disease.

<HEAD>August Wilson's Theatrical Blues Find a British Home</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At last they're singing August Wilson's theatrical
blues in London.
   After years of being virtually unknown in Britain, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning American playwright is responsible for one of the
hits of the London fall: ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' at the Royal
National Theater.
   ``Ma Rainey'' ran eight months on Broadway in the 1984-5 season,
was named best play by the New York Drama Critics' Circle and was a
Tony nominee.
   Wilson's next play, ``Fences,'' again won the Drama Critics'
award, as well as the Tony and the Pulitzer Prize. ``Joe Turner's
Come and Gone,'' netted Wilson's third Drama Critics' award in four
years.
   In the United States, Wilson is considered one of the great
finds of the decade in playwriting. A former poet born in
Pittsburgh to a black mother and a white father, Wilson is writing
a cycle of plays about the black experience this century, one play
for each decade.
   Now, confounding those who doubted Wilson's pungently
colloquial, blues-based language could travel overseas, ``Ma
Rainey'' has won plaudits in London, vindicating the playwright's
belief that his message and characters transcend borders.
   ``I think it's a true test of the universality of the play, if
you can move from the specifics of black American expression and
say, OK, the plays are about that, but they are also about the
human condition,'' Wilson said in an interview at the National,
where ``Ma Rainey'' opened Oct. 25 in the small Cottesloe
auditorium. Intended to run until Jan. 27, the production has been
extended through May.
   Set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927, the play tells a
rending story of racial exploitation and divisiveness involving Ma
Rainey, the ``mother of the blues''; the four black members of her
band; and the two white men who are her producer and manager.
   The cast mixes local talent such as Oxford-educated Hugh
Quarshie with such American expatriates as Clarke Peters, who
starred in ``Driving Miss Daisy'' on the West End.
   The director is Englishman Howard Davies, whose last American
play was Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' at the
National in 1988. He also directed ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' in
London and on Broadway.
   Carol Woods-Coleman, who plays Ma Rainey, initially doubted the
actors and director would mesh in their approach to the play.
   ``I was wondering about that prior to meeting Howard (but) our
first meeting put all those queries at ease,'' said Woods-Coleman.
   She praised Davies as ``sensitive and sensible and a very
thorough director.
   ``He let us move with our experience of being black and knowing
about black history without putting bridles on us,'' said the
actress, who won London acclaim in 1987 for the musical ``Blues in
the Night.'' She starred in an off-Broadway production of that show
last fall.
   In the United States, Wilson has worked almost exclusively
alongside black director Lloyd Richards, and feels ``Ma Rainey'' is
``best served by a black director.''
   But ``any human should be interested in, and able to recognize,
the humanity in it,'' he says.
   ``Because the play is about betrayal and honor and duty and love
and all these other universal things, it should be able to be
directed by anyone _ white, Asian, whoever.''
   ``Ma Rainey'' is the second recent American play, following
David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow,'' which the National has staged
commendably this year.
   Two other Wilson plays debut in Britain in March: ``Joe Turner's
Come and Gone'' at the ``fringe'' Tricycle Theater in northwest
London, and ``Fences'' at the Liverpool Playhouse, with Richards
repeating his Tony-winning direction.
   Wilson's next Broadway play, ``The Piano Lesson,'' opens April
16 at the Walter Kerr Theater.

   When you're talking about the book, ``Blinds &amp;
Shutters,'' subtitled ``the Photographic Collection of Michael
Cooper,'' further subtitled ``Text and Actual Signatures of his
Friends, the World's Pop and Art Legends,'' you're talking big
numbers.
   The 384-page book, of which 5,000 have been printed, weighs 11
pounds, has a pricetag of $595 and cost Bill Wyman, the Rolling
Stones' bassist, $100,000.
   It's sold by mail, from Christopher, Cabot and Fuller, in
Atlanta.
   Cooper, a young British photographer, who hung out in the worlds
of art, fashion and pop music, died in 1973. The book includes a
suicide letter addressed to his 8-year-old son, Adam. Adam Cooper
now works as a clapper loader on movies.
   ``Michael was hanging around with a camera,'' Wyman recalls.
``Nobody paid much attention. He took pictures without you
realizing it. Those were the days you weren't afraid of the gutter
press in England. You never thought of a photographer interfering
in your privacy. Lucky Michael. He did our `Their Satanic Majesties
Request' cover and the Beatles' `Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band.'''
   Wyman was involved in the larger-than-expected project of
compiling the book for six years.
   ``I was approached by Michael's son and his assistant,'' Wyman
recalled in an interview.
   ``They wanted to put together a really good book about Michael's
life. I put them in touch with various people. They came back a
month later; they weren't having much joy.''
   Wyman said they had print and identify for about 70,000
negatives. Very few had been seen before.
   ``We had continual meetings. I put them in touch with people to
do one and two-hour interviews with people who loved Michael.
They'd show Eric Clapton a picture and ask him to say something
about it and they did general interviews.''
   Wyman said he financed everything. ``I dread to think how much I
spent. It was $100,000 at a minimum. I might recoup some. I thought
it was a nice project to be involved in. It has been done very
nicely. If I don't recoup, I'll still be happy. It's something
special.'' Wyman says that some people buy expensive limited
edition books hoping to sell them later at a profit.
   Since Cooper was a special friend of Keith Richards and not
close to Wyman, why did Cooper's son approach Wyman for help?
   ``Keith isn't the kind of person that would do a thing like
that,'' Cooper said. I'm more organized than Keith, businesswise.
I've got an office in London. I've always been interested in other
projects. I'm almost finished with my history of the Rolling Stones
book.''
   Many of the reminiscences culled from the interviews, included
between pictures, talk about the drug scene.
   ``It is hard for me to talk about that because I wasn't
involved. I had family. I was one of the two married Stones at that
time. Charlie Watts was the other. We didn't hang out with the
fraternity very much at all,'' he said.
   ``The music business and people around that I was very into. I
didn't know fashion people, artists, writers and poets so much.
There were a few clubs that everybody used to go to. Peter Blake,
who did the wonderful painting of the Beatles with just the eyes, I
became great friends with him and am to this day.''
   Each book has 10 original signatures, some even contain Andy
Warhol's.
   Cooper took pictures from the early '60s to the early '70s.
Commenting on the '60s, Wyman says, ``It was rather wonderful. I
don't think anybody was really aware of the enormity of change. We
(the Rolling Stones) were responsible for certain changes in
fashion and hair, being the long-haired ones at the beginning. We
made it possible for places like restaurants, bars and clubs to let
you in without ties and jackets. The casual approach was unheard of
then. Through a lot of problems we had at the beginning, things
changed.
   ``We were all ostracized for minor things. We couldn't go into
pubs and buy cigarettes. They would tell us, `We don't serve the
likes of you.' We were refused food in restaurants. We were not
conventional and they'd rather not deal with us, I suppose. It
happened in every country.
   ``We were the only band that went on stage without uniforms. The
Rolling Stones walked on casually. Now everybody has done it, ever
since.''
   Asked whether the 1989 Rolling Stones tour is exhausting, Wyman
says, ``The shows aren't. Going on stage has always been a joy;
still is good fun. The energy is wonderful. Moving, traveling,
unpacking, trying to get food and laundry done _ all those silly
things are exhausting.
   ``We do have the odd day off. Everybody took a week off in Los
Angeles except me. I was doing work for this book.''
   Has he ever thought, since the tour started, ``I'm too old for
this''?
   A smile creases Wyman's face. ``I wondered. But since the tour
has been going, it's been OK.''

<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Benny Hill was a lad, his grandad took him
to places of learning in London. These places had revues called
``Piccadilly Spangles'' or ``Toujours La Femme,'' and dance troupes
like ``The Saucy Girls.''
   A fine education. But what most interested him was the
``prin-com,'' the principal comedian. Little Benny saw that the
prin-com got lots of laughter and hugs and kisses from all the
dancing girls.
   ``I'd think, `That's not a bad life,''' he recalls. ``And I
think that's when I got hooked.''
   Thus it has been for most of Hill's working life _ dancing girls
in minimalist costumes, slighty naughty comedy, word-play, a bit of
music hall. Much of it still is on display on about 100 U.S. TV
stations as the syndicated ``The Benny Hill Show.''
   Sight gags abound in his shows. A recent one here showed him as
a ship's captain about to sing. As he opened his mouth, the ship's
foghorn made what sounded like a basso whoopee cushion being sat on.
   It bothers him not that some dare call this vulgar. ``You can do
a show for six of your friends or you can do a show for as many
people as possible. I'd rather make a hundred million people
laugh.''
   His half-hour shows, seen since 1979 in the United States,
actually are bits and pieces of the three to five one-hour specials
he usually makes each year in London. He reckons he's made about 70
in 20 years.
   He usually takes four days to rehearse each one, then five to
film them. The skits are rapid-fire. Not so the writing of them.
   The longest part is the writing, he says: ``I write the show on
trains, on buses, in hotel rooms on the beach at St. Tropez.'' His
voice trails off and he smiles.
   This is far better than the early days, when he was a struggling
young straight-man-turned-comic in music halls, pubs and the army
camps where, during and shortly after World War II, he honed his
entertainer's skills.
   The army pay was minimal, he notes, ``but it was a very good
audience. You didn't have to sweat blood for them.''
   The man the British tabloids call ``King Leer'' spoke of these
things while on a recent visit to Manhattan to case the joint for a
one-hour special. He'll tape it here _ at least sketches on the
streets _ in April or May.
   Some comics, when off-stage, are said to be quiet, anguished
souls who are on a first-name basis with the dreads. Not Hill, 64,
a lifelong bachelor.
   Sitting in an office here with Dennis Kirkland, for 20 years the
producer-director of his shows, he remains an epic in extrovert,
skittering from thought to thought, accent to accent.
   The tour of accents in understandable. Hill's cast of characters
is many and varied, ranging from a Japanese warrior to a French
waiter at the Hotel Sordide. But he has Shakespeare time logged,
too, as Bottom in a TV production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
   He admires the fine British comic, Spike Milligan: ``An
original.'' Also W.C. Fields, one of his heroes. And Danny Thomas,
whose gentle tales of family life might seem an odd choice, given
Hill's quick-hit style of humor.
   He first saw Thomas in 1948, in London. ``He was the first comic
I'd seen who spoke the truth, or I thought it was the truth,'' Hill
says.
   Most British comics did quick jokes,
a-funny-thing-happened-to-me-on-the-way-to gags, he says. ``But
when Danny Thomas talks about his home, he seems to be telling the
truth, and that's why it's more funny.''
   During his visit here, Hill briefly visited with a civilian, a
fan named Donald Trump. Trump, as the world knows, is somewhat
wealthy.
   Hill also is in the chips, although to a lesser extent. Unlike
Trump, he lives quietly, without flash, and sometimes takes buses.
This makes the British tabloids consider him eccentric.
   He in turn considers them eccentric. At one point in the
interview, he mentions that a news photographer in London spent 12
weeks perched in a tree to get a shot _ not involving him _ of a
furtive affair-in-progress.
   But that is the way of the tabloids back home, he says, and why
he is wary of journalists there. Eyes twinkling, Benny Hill quotes
what he says is a British saying:
   ``The only reason that people believe truth is stranger than
fiction is because they're not so used to reading it.''

Lloyd Webber) will be honored on the two-hour broadcast, and the

   Financial need forced Karen Coats back into the
workplace four years ago, but temporary employment has since
allowed her to spend the time she needs with her two teen-age boys.
   ``There's spurts of time when home is the priority,'' Mrs. Coats
said. ``I totally lose touch with what's going on at home with my
husband and kids if I work 40 hours a week.''
   Mrs. Coats, 37, of Indianapolis, is just one of many Americans
flocking to temporary employment agencies. Some are parents seeking
flexibility. Others are students seeking summer jobs, housewives or
retirees looking to relieve boredom or people easing back into the
workplace. Some make temporary work their career.
   ``The image people have of temporaries is, `Oh, these are people
who can't get a full-time job,''' said Laurie Andersen, information
specialist at Manpower Temporary Services. ``But that is passe.''
   Manpower Inc., based in surburban Milwaukee, is the world's
largest temporary agency, employing about 1 million people a year,
Ms. Andersen said. Manpower has 1,450 offices and 300,000 customer
companies in 33 countries.
   Britain's Blue Arrow PLC bought Manpower in 1987, but in a
switch, Manpower President Mitchell Fromstein became the chief
executive of the smaller Blue Arrow.
   Flexibility and the chance to make extra money are primary
reasons single and married parents choose temporary employment, she
said. Temporaries can tell the agency if they prefer long-term or
short-term assignments and can refuse a call to work, she said.
   ``Many temporaries are secondary wage earners and responsible
for running the household and taking care of the children,'' she
said. ``They don't have the pressing need to work 40 hours a week.''
   Ms. Andersen said temporary workers' wages depend on the job,
company and location. A file clerk with minimal skills could make
$5 an hour, while people with specialized computer skills can earn
more than $20 an hour, she said.
   Some workers who have a need for full-time employment still rely
on temporary work either as a career or as a steppingstone to more
permanent jobs.
   ``Temporary work has given me an overview of what's available in
the employment arena,'' said Marianne DuBois, 41, a single parent
who moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., from California last summer. ``It
does meet my needs at this point.''
   For many people, the biggest drawbacks of temporary work are the
lack of employment security and health and pension benefits that
regular employees get. But many temporary agencies now offer
employee benefits such as insurance coverage and paid vacations
after a certain length of service.
   ``It's great for me,'' said Pam Skallinger of Maplewood, Mich.,
who has been a temporary for six years. ``I've got all the benefits
plus the flexibility.
   ``It gives me a chance to be a good mother and give my all to my
assignment when I have one,'' she said.
   College students make up a large part of the temporary work
force for several reasons, said Jim Dinsmore, public relations
manager for Kelly Services Inc. in Troy, Mich.
   ``It gives a lot of students the chance to work during the
summers but it's also a good way to get exposed to the job market
for recent graduates,'' he said.
   Temporary agencies also provide a chance for companies to see
workers in action before committing to hire them permanently.
   Manpower's workforce went from 330,000 in 1979 to 1 million this
year, and Kelly's rose from 330,000 to 550,000 during the same
period, the companies reported.
   While more men are entering the temporary workforce, they make
up only about 10 percent to 15 percent of their current employees.
Most temporaries are office workers.
   One area of major growth has been older workers. Workers aged 55
and up make up 15 percent of Manpower's workforce. Kelly has an
Encore program to recruit and retain senior employees.
   ``We get a lot of older, retired people who are bored,'' he
said. ``They want to stay busy but they can't work full time or
they might lose their social security.''
   Dinsmore said he believes temporary workers have found a
permanent spot with many companies.
   ``A lot of companies have temporary workers as a line item on
their budgets,'' he said. ``It's becoming more and more popular to
use temporaries for special projects instead of just to fill in for
sick people or vacation time.''

<HEAD>U.S. Greens Formulating Platform for National Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A variety of activists on environmental, energy
and social issues are drafting a political program to create a
national Green political party as early as next year, organizers
say.
   Modeled after Green parties in Europe, the party would seek to
build nationwide policy on environmental and social issues that it
says get inadequate attention from the Republican and Democratic
parties.
   But Green planners are divided on whether their new party should
make an early run at national office, traditionally almost
impossible for American third parties, or first concentrate its
efforts on capturing local and state offices.
   The Green Committees of Correspondence, a federation of about
200 groups nationwide, mailed a 36-page list of proposed stands to
3,500 people this fall, said Jim Richmond, coordinator for the
group's national clearinghouse in Kansas City, Mo.
   The Greens, as they call themselves, plan to ratify the final
platform at a September 1990 meeting in Boulder, Colo. Meanwhile,
the 200 groups are planning regional meetings to debate stands on
19 issues, including land use, water, social justice, energy,
health, education and finance.
   ``It's activists and just regular folks of all stripes who are
concerned what direction this planet is headed in,'' Richmond said
of the 4-year-old group.
   Born from the remnants of Vietnam war protesters and the
environmental and anti-nuclear movements that appeared in the
1960s, the largely white, well-educated Greens are far behind
European parties with the same name, said writer Brian Tokar, an
organizer.
   Tokar, a toxic chemical and energy consultant, said the U.S. and
Canadian Greens movements have been held back by the political
systems in each country.
   Many European countries use a system of proportional
representation in parliamentary elections, which allows even small
parties to get into Parliament if they win a minor percentage of
the vote nationwide. Fringe parties have a harder time under the
U.S. and Canadian systems, which elect representatives by district.
   European Greens, united by polluted rivers and forests dying
from acid rain, won 30 seats this year in the 475-seat European
Parliament.
   West Germany has the largest Greens contingent _ 42 of the 519
federal parliamentarians. They also are in the legislatures of
Belgium, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands.
   ``European Greens are basically defined by four pillars,'' said
Tokar. Those are: ecology, social responsibility,
community-oriented democracy and the non-violent movement _ where
they are often seen demonstrating against nuclear missiles.
   ``Greens in this country strongly embrace those principles, but
we've sought to elaborate on them,'' Tokar said from his
Plainfield, Vt., home.
   The draft political program emphasizes:
   _Creating environmental and economic policy that is not harmful
to the United States or the world.
   _Decentralization, bringing decision-making back from the
federal and state level to local communities and the people whose
lives it affects.
   _An end to oppression based on race, sex and economics.
   _Focusing on how the nation can work in harmony with the world
community and nature.
   ``The centerpiece is to rethink our relationship to the earth,''
said John Rensenbrink, professor of political science at Bowdoin
College in Maine, another organizer.
   Issues such as the destruction of the Earth's protecting ozone
layer are related to any number of government decisions in areas of
energy, health, education and finance, he said.
   A handful of people guide the group, which opposes the concept
of hierarchy. Decisions are made by committees of representatives,
and a national leadership probably will not be chosen until the
U.S. Greens jump into politics, he said.
   As they continue to organize, Greens are forming clubs at
universities and have state organizations in Michigan, California,
Georgia, Maine, Wisconsin and Massachusetts, Rensenbrink said.
   However, the would-be political party is hindered by divisions
on several issues.
   _Green principles call for restraining capitalism where it harms
the environment or community life. But conservative Greens, who
joined to fight pollution, believe in a national economy driven by
relatively free capitalism, Tokar said.
   _Greens members debating the proposed national platform are
leaning toward a pro-choice abortion stance _ but some members are
anti-abortion, said Richmond and Rensenbrink.
   _Some Greens want a national party to organize on the state and
local level, while others want to field a national candidate,
Greens leaders said.
   While the Greens are closest ideologically to liberal Democrats,
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said her
party is not worried.
   ``The bottom line is that the Democratic Party has a strong
platform,'' she said, adding that it includes environmental and
human rights issues.
   Patrick Stroh, a New York University instructor in American
politics, said the Greens may be able to push the issues they
champion up on the agenda of the established parties.
   But he expects the winner-take-all election system coupled with
difficulty raising money from their grassroots, activist
constituency will keep the Greens all but invisible in U.S.
politics. Third parties usually are most successful in local
elections.
   ``My overall assessment of their chances is very, very gloomy,''
Stroh said.

<HEAD>The Doctor and Woody Allen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's a diagnosis of Woody Allen's ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' courtesy of Martin S. Bergmann, a therapist for
more than 40 years and clinical professor of psychology at New York
University:
   ``You have a very a successful physician (Martin Landau), who is
starting an affair where he doesn't know what he's getting himself
into. He doesn't show you at any time what the mistress (Anjelica
Huston) really meant. We really don't understand what she once met
to him, nor do we understand what the marriage means to him.
   ``Then you have the character of Clifford that Woody Allen
represents, who is kind of idealistic but very unsuccessful. He
falls in love with this woman (Mia Farrow) and eventually she, too,
disappoints him.
   ``You have to ask yourself not whether it makes sense in an
isolated event, but whether it makes sense in the framework. I must
say it does make sense. There is a kind of Chaplinesque idea there
_ that life is very mysterious and you are a very small man.''
   Very perceptive for a man who knows more about analytic couches
than casting couches, but what business does a psychiatrist have
rating films? In this case, plenty.
   Actors have played therapists, notably Ingrid Bergman and
Gregory Peck in Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 thriller ``Spellbound,''
and Montgomery Clift starred as John Huston's ``Freud.'' Now an
analyst has turned actor.
   In a major breakthrough for the psychiatric field, Bergmann
makes his film debut in ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' portraying the
kindly Dr. Levy, a philosopher of love and the subject of a
documentary Clifford is producing.
   Although an admirer of Allen's work, Bergmann wasn't looking to
be in the movies. His ``discovery'' came through an unexpected
connection. A student, who knew Allen's casting director,
recommended Bergmann for the part.
   ``He (Allen) took me to a room and asked me questions,''
Bergmann recalled. ``He wanted me to talk. He wanted me to talk
about love, death and religion. I spoke about all of these topics
for an hour and a half. He used a few excerpts in the movie.''
   He only worked on the set for half a day and actually filmed a
few scenes that were cut from the final release. One segment, in
which Bergmann and Allen were to have a philosophical conversation
while walking through Central Park, was cut because of cold
weather. Another was scuttled because of a misconnection between
the film world and academia.
   ``I was supposed to teach a class on the Holocaust,'' Bergmann
said, ``but there I was, trying to ask questions and all the
students were dummy actors, who were not supposed to answer
questions. I am accustomed to an exchange and none of my questions
were picked up.''
   Psychiatry is his profession, but Bergmann really has read
enough to qualify as a doctor of love as well. He's even written a
book, ``The Anatomy of Love'' ($14.50, Columbia University Press),
an academic's attempt to examine how the great thinkers of the ages
have tried to make sense out of an emotion that seems without logic.
   ``Literature on love originated in Egypt 3,500 years ago, and
the metaphors which the Egyptians used are still our metaphors now:
love as a sickness, with the beloved as a physician. That love is a
trap, they had already developed. Metaphors persist unchanged.
   ``Plato believed that we were once one person, that some of us
were men and women, some of us were only women, and some of us were
only men. We were cut in half and each half yearns for the other.''
   Bergmann was born in 1913 in Czechoslovakia, lived in Israel in
the 1920s and '30s and began practicing psychiatry when he
emigrated to the United States after World War II.
   He's a fan of movies, but warns against taking them too
seriously. There are no Clark Gables in real life, no Cary Grants _
not even any Dr. Levys.
   ``We begin life kind of living in fantasy; we acquire reality
only slowly and relinquish our world of fantasy only slowly. Long
before movies were ever invented, the adjustment to reality was a
very slow process because we have to accept limitations, and
limitations are always painful.
   ``So we reserve a domain called fantasy in which we are still
king and where our wishes can be met. Then come the movies, and
it's on the screen. So it's no longer in the head, it has a
quasi-reality. For many people it is full reality.''

   We've already had Rudolph, the Chipmunks and the
Raisins.
   Now, hopping and bopping to our shores from the north of England
comes a creature with _ it's a compliment in the music business _
ears.
   He's Jive Bunny.
   His first record is ``Swing the Mood,'' which sounds a lot like
Glenn Miller's ``In the Mood.'' The beat is what's happening now,
in clubs whose dancers have parents too young to remember that
Glenn Miller and swing were once the world's dance music.
   ``Swing the Mood'' has hit No. 1 in nine countries _ Britain,
West Germany, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway,
Australia and New Zealand. It's the fastest selling record in four
years in Britain.
   As Jive Bunny comes to the United States, his creator, John
Pickles, comes with him, visiting Atco Records, doing the talking
for his rabbit frontman and handing out plastic carrot ballpoints
to nose-twitching journalists.
   He says the reason ``Swing the Mood'' is such a big success is
that the older generation likes the Glenn Miller sound, people his
age like the nostalgic rock that's mixed into it, teens like the
dance beat and kids like the bunny.
   Pickles always wanted to be in show business and now, at 47, he
is. His father, a Yorkshire miner, became ill and couldn't work, so
young Pickles left school and got a job in an electrical shop
before he was 15. He bought it at 25 and still has it _ ``retail
and repair, domestic.''
   He also has been a frequent master of ceremonies and
after-dinner speaker. ``I've always been involved in a lot of
things. I'm a nutter that way.''
   Pickles, who drew up his own Jive Bunny contracts, sounds the
opposite of a nut case or ``a simple boy from Yorkshire,'' which he
terms himself. He's proud that the artist who drew Jive Bunny and
the company that made 20 heads, for appearances by the
finger-snapping, dancing rabbit, are Yorkshiremen. He's determined
not to move from Rotherham to London.
   And if his novelty lapin goes down the burrow as fast as he shot
up, Pickles can cope. ``What's important to me is being happy and
content. Money doesn't make me tick. It's nice to have financial
stability but it's not the be-all and end-all. I like to have a
good time.''
   Pickles' son and two daughters from his first marriage _ Matthew
John was born to Pickles and his second wife Oct. 18 while ``Swing
the Mood'' was No. 1 in England _ used to like bedtime stories he
made up. So he has written some Jive Bunny stories in rhyme.
Publishers, TV and stuffed toy makers have shown an interested
whisker.
   The tale of Jive Bunny began when Pickles bought and revamped,
in 1983, a going-out-of-business recording studio where he used to
record songs he composed. He named it Music Factory. ``I was
reminded by my bank manager it was an expensive hobby. I decided to
make it a money-making hobby.''
   In 1986, after much negotiating for a license with the agency
representing United Kingdom record companies, he started
Mastermixer, a service to disc jockeys in dance clubs, the second
such business in England. It built to 1,500 DJs across Europe. This
year, Pickles decided to put dance mixes _ they're spliced from
existing recordings _ on the general market.
   He looked through mixes on hand to see what might sell. Pickles
came across one by Les Hemstock, an Englishman living in Norway,
one of eight mixers working for him. Pickles flew him to England
and paired him in the studio with his 20-year-old son, Andy, to
polish it for a six-minute, 12-inch dance record.
   ``It took them five days to create `Swing the Mood' and took me
four months to clear all the tracks. Nobody understood what I was
talking about when I'd say, `I want to license 20 seconds of your
record,''' Pickles said in an interview.
   Even ``In the Mood,'' used as underpinning for ``Swing the
Mood,'' gave Pickles trouble. It was recorded in Glenn Miller style
by the John Anderson Band, which he couldn't find. Eventually, he
discovered it in Northern Ireland, operated by two men who had day
jobs and owned their own, obscure record label.
   Pickles' mixers use machine-made drum loops. Vintage music had
human drummers. ``You've got to keep varying the tempo (of the old
music),'' Pickles said. ``It can take six hours to get a 20-second
link so it matches our back beat.''
   He's horrified at the suggestion of using another human drummer.
``That wouldn't work! We've taken the good old tracks and given
them a today's feel.''
   Pickles cogitated, decided the record needed a frontman. Andy
snapped his fingers and proclaimed, ``Jive Bunny.''
   The younger Pickles had labored in his father's electrical
workshop where one man called everybody ``Bunny.'' They called him
``Jack Bunny.''
   Pickles phoned an artist friend: ``I want a rabbit. He is hip.
He is today. He is cool.'' Jive Bunny was born.
   ``We all know how much money can be lost in the record pressing
business,'' Pickles said. ``I pressed up 2,000 records, gave 1,000
to disc jockeys, sold 1,000 in Europe to agents I've got out there
and went on holiday for two weeks, in May. When I got back
everybody in Europe was crazy for `Swing the Mood.' I released it
in July hoping it'd get into the Top 75.''
   Its second week it was 31. Two weeks later it was No. 1, where
it stayed five weeks.
   Followups were needed. The second single by Jive Bunny and the
Mastermixers is ``That's What I Like'' using ``The Twist.'' Chubby
Checker has done some voiceovers for the company. The John Anderson
Band was commissioned to record ``Hawaii Five-O'' music. ``Jive
Bunny, the Album,'' to be released here in December, has eight
mixes made from 70 recordings. Pickles will take ``Hopping Mad''
off the album, add some Christmas music, and release it in England
as ``Let's Party.''
   Bookmakers are betting it'll be a Christmas favorite, Pickles
says, and the record isn't created yet. Jive Bunny, whose Father
Christmas suit is on the drawing board, isn't worried.

<HEAD>Classics Always Come Home for Christmas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tinsel is on the tree, the egg nog is
poured and the yule log aglow. All you need is something on the
stereo to complete that holiday mood.
   There's always Bing Crosby's time-honored croon of ``White
Christmas.'' Nat King Cole's voice remains forever strong on ``The
Christmas Song.'' Elvis Presley's ``Blue Christmas'' still tugs at
hearts.
   If you're thinking they don't make them like they used to,
you're right.
   ``It's been a long time since something's come along that's
become a classic,'' said Joel Whitburn, whose Milwaukee-based
Record Research Inc. monitors what's hot and what's not in the
music world.
   Money pressures and the daunting prospect of competing with
still-popular standards from decades, even centuries, ago mean that
few artists even try to write new holiday standards today.
   ``If you're going to write a whole bunch of new Christmas
carols, who cares?'' said Nebraska-based composer Chip Davis.
   Davis, who records as a one-man band under the name Mannheim
Steamroller, is responsible for one of the few holiday music
success stories of the 1980s. He records instrumental ``New Age''
versions of Christmas classics specifically designed for compact
disc players.
   With record companies re-releasing classics by Crosby, the
Carpenters, Johnny Mathis and Phil Spector every year, it may be a
surprise to learn that Davis' 1984 release, ``Mannheim Steamroller
Christmas,'' and his 1988 recording, ``A Fresh Aire Christmas,''
were the top two selling holiday albums last year.
   It was for Davis.
   ``I didn't really expect it to do anything because it was sort
of a known thing that this sort of junk just croaks,'' said Davis,
who was advised against recording holiday songs, of how Christmas
music fares in the marketplace.
   ``Christmas albums were pretty much considered death in the
industry,'' Davis said. ``If you did a Christmas album, it was like
signing off.''
   The Mannheim Steamroller records wed the old and new in a
combination perfect for listeners too old for rock 'n' roll novelty
records and too young for Lawrence Welk. Orchestras, synthesizers
and electric guitars are used in instrumental versions of classics
and a few new compositions.
   Davis' records, along with George Winston's ``December'' album
on Windham Hill Records, are expected to be hot sellers again this
year.
   ``It has a broad appeal,'' said Geoff Mayfield, associate
research director for Billboard magazine. ``If you like traditional
Christmas music, that's what it's about, but it's presented in a
new way. People with gray hair can like it. And if you're a kid you
can sit through it, and it doesn't have to sound like Mitch
Miller.''
   Holiday records have always been a strange stepchild of the
music industry. Artists compete during a compressed time period to
sell music to be heard in the background at a few parties then
tossed into closets for 11 months.
   This kind of high-risk, low-return work makes many songwriters
run in the other direction, Davis said. ``Your ego gets stepped
on,'' he said.
   ``They're probably some of the most difficult types of songs to
write and have catch on because there's such an established litany
of old material that people are fond of,'' said David McLees,
artists and repertoire coordinator for Rhino Records.
   The all-time champ of the modern era is Irving Berlin's
composition of ``White Christmas,'' heard first in the 1942 movie
``Holiday Inn.'' The song has sold in excess of 100 million copies,
with Crosby's version accounting for about 30 million, Whitburn
said.
   The Christmas song that's sold the most copies since 1955 is a
little less reverent _ it's the novelty record ``The Chipmunk
Song,'' first released in 1958, Whitburn said.
   Most of the Christmas records that are played repeatedly on the
radio these days date from the 1955-65 decade. They include
``Jingle Bell Rock,'' ``Silver Bells,'' ``The Little Drummer Boy,''
``Please Come Home for Christmas,'' ``The Christmas Song'' and
``Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.''
   In fact, of the Top 10 best-selling Christmas songs for what
Billboard magazine defines as the ``rock era'' (1955 and after),
only one is from after 1970. That's the barked version of ``Jingle
Bells'' by the Singing Dogs.
   The only new song of the 1980s to show any staying power is Elmo
and Patsy's warped ``Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'' from
1983. The jury's still out on ``Do They Know It's Christmas,'' the
Band Aid song that launched the rock 'n' roll philanthropy trend of
the 1980s.
   Mannheim Steamroller and other ``New Age'' records will face
stiff competition this year from teen-age chartbusters New Kids on
the Block.
   They've released a Christmas album with several new compositions
by their behind-the-scenes guru, Maurice Starr, and yes, another
version of ``White Christmas.'' It' already achieved the relatively
rare feat of appearing on Billboard's top album _ not Christmas
album _ chart in October.
   Other artists planning new Christmas records this year are Kenny
Rogers, Randy Travis, Wynton Marsalis, Ricky Van Shelton, Leon
Redbone and Roger Whitaker.
   Some record companies are hoping creative approaches to
packaging will gain them a niche in the Christmas market. Motown
Records is releasing a collection of songs from many of its
artists, including Smokey Robinson and the Temptations. TVT Records
is presenting a sampling of Christmas songs sung by soap opera
stars.
   Rhino Records, known for its aggressive repackaging, will
present ``Bummed Out Christmas,'' a collection for Christmas cynics
featuring such songs as ``Santa Came Home Drunk,'' ``Christmas in
Prison'' and ``Somebody Stole My Santa Claus Suit.''
   Rhino's collectibles also feature ``Hillbilly Holiday,'' ``Cool
Yule'' and albums by Dr. Demento, Spike Jones, James Brown and the
Three Stooges.
   Rhino is not neglecting new material; it's releasing a
collection of new recordings by Dr. John, Nicolette Larson and the
Roches. But McLees said there's not much of a market out there
anymore for new Christmas songs.
   ``It has to be a great song to break through and come back every
Christmas,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ South Carolina school principal Ben Nesbit became
suspicious when two students who had been suspended for illicit
drug use passed a drug test with little trouble. ``We found out a
couple of weeks ago that there's a chemical that washes drugs out
of the system,'' said Nesbit, whose school has received national

   South Carolina school principal Ben Nesbit
became suspicious when two students who had been suspended for
illicit drug use passed a drug test with little trouble.
   ``We found out a couple of weeks ago that there's a chemical
that washes drugs out of the system,'' said Nesbit, whose school _
Spring Valley High of Columbia, S.C. _ has received national
acclaim for its drug-fighting efforts. ``The students use it full
time: washing out their systems and being tested, all the time
being high.''
   The street name of the chemical is ``Golden Seal,'' said
District of Columbia teacher Leroy Lewis Jr., explaining the
``herb'' also is popular with students in the nation's capital.
   This latest student scam is proof that the war on drugs in
schools is serious and must be waged in a no-nonsense but flexible
manner, Lewis said.
   ``Kids recognize all the problems of the system,'' said Lewis, a
U.S. government teacher at Spingarn Senior High School. ``They know
how to circumvent us better than we know how to plan.''
   The battle to keep the nation's youngsters away from drugs has
evolved from a mere ``Just Say No'' slogan, devised by former First
Lady Nancy Reagan, to a threat by the Bush adminitration to end
federal aid to schools, colleges and universities that fail to
document tough policies against illegal drug use.
   The tougher approach reflects the nation's growing concern with
drug abuse. Statistics say that 5 percent of high school seniors
drink daily and more than 60,000 adolescents ages 12 and 13 have
tried cocaine.
   ``Young people show a faster propensity to develop an addiction
and the damage by addiction can be more permanent,'' said Doug Hall
of the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
   The government is expected to spend some $500 million under the
drug education program this fiscal year, about $180 million more
than the year that ended Sept. 30. In 1986, only $3 million was
budgeted for drug education.
   Almost all high schools and 87 percent of elementary schools
offer some sort of anti-drug lessons. The new national drug
strategy says school-based prevention programs should be reinforced
by tough policies on use, possession and distribution of drugs.
   Schools are trying a variety of approaches with no clear trend
emerging. Success is hard to determine since so many of the
approaches are new.
   In Texas, football players are tested. Illinois and Delaware
laws allow spot searches of students, and Delaware plans to use
drug-sniffing dogs in the schools.
   Jefferson County, Ky., schools notify police of every campus
drug incident, suspend students for six to 10 days for drug
possession or use, and transfer repeat offenders. The Pittsburgh
Board of Education has decided any student convicted of trafficking
in or possessing drugs, on or off school property, will be subject
to expulsion.
   ``Drug Free Zone'' signs surround public and private schools in
Prince Georges' County, Md., warning that anyone found possessing
or distributing drugs within 1,000 feet of a school yard faces
strict penalties, ranging from 5 to 40 years in prison.
   Education officials estimate as many as 25 states have some sort
of drug-free zone programs or laws.
   ``We see more expulsions and suspensions for use because it's
against the law,'' said James Better, staff director of the
Education Department's Drug-Free Schools Recognition Program. ``But
most schools have referral and re-entry programs.''
   At the local level, Education Department officials estimate 73
percent of America's 16,490 school districts have written policies
against substance abuse. Of these, more than 90 percent involve
notification of parents and or police, suspension or counseling.
   Most major education groups avoid advocating specific drug
policies for schools. At most they offer general guidelines, like
those jointly developed by the American Association of School
Administrators, the National Association of School Nurses and the
National Education Association.
   ``We have problems when the feds try to impose decisions on the
locals, so national groups avoid doing the same thing,'' said Lew
Armistead of the National Association of Secondary School
Principals.
   Hall, vice president of the National Parents' Resource Institute
for Drug Education in Atlanta, said: ``We don't believe in dealing
with these people as criminals. You really can't incarcerate your
way out of a drug problem.''
   Hall pointed to statistics that say ``school buildings or
campuses are one of the least popular places'' for students to use
or distribute drugs. Also, he said, students tend to use drugs more
at night and on weekends.
   ``PRIDE supports treatment on demand,'' said Hall. ``But the
problem is it's difficult to draw the line on whether the school is
responsible or the parents.''
   Nesbit insisted: ``It is a school problem because they can't
learn when they are stoned. They can't learn when they're dead.
They can't learn when they're in the hospital. We're going to be
paying for their rehabilitation forever and ever because so many
people are hooked.''
   Nesbit said his drug-fighting efforts encompass more grassroots
approaches of ``sending out letters of complaints to local liquor
stores that sell alcohol to minors'' to encouraging temporary
suspensions for drug use and automatic expulsion for drug sales.
   In addition to the District of Columbia's citywide policies,
Lewis offers early-morning tutoring for students who want help with
school work and ``to talk about what's going on with them, with
somebody they want to trust.''
   Jenlane Gee, a teacher from Modesto, Calif. _ recognized along
with Nesbit and Lewis as among the nation's best teachers and
principals _ complained that the government's drug-fighting efforts
have ignored elementary schools.
   Gee, who teaches third graders at Christine Sipherd School, said
just as much emphasis should be focused on the elementary schools
because studies show that children usually decide by the third to
fifth grade whether to experiment with drugs.
   Nesbit added that simply talking _ or acting _ tough won't stem
student drug use.
   ``I think there's a hard line'' emerging in the schools, he
said. ``But there's no comprehensive policy that helps kids to make
good decisions about their future, their bodies and their values.''

<HEAD>Health Care Gaining Rank as Rural Development Goal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural advocates for years have urged more
attention for the medical needs of sparsely settled areas, the
small towns and farms where a fourth of America's people live.
   A recent study done for the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association says improved health care insurance would help as much
as anything, ranking with jobs, water and sewer systems.
   The association, a lobbying force on Capitol Hill, is a major
backer of comprehensive rural development legislation.
   Rural development is also the concern of a number of
congressional leaders, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who says: ``We cannot
have two Americas _ one a land of opportunity and a second, rural
America, left behind.''
   Leahy said rural areas, with an estimated 61 million people and
14,000 small towns and cities, are in trouble because of higher
unemployment and poverty rates than in metropolitan areas.
   The problems of rural health care seem obvious to the casual
observer _ there are simply not enough doctors and hospitals in the
countryside. A sick or injured person in the big city has a much
better chance of getting quick treatment than a farmer in the
middle of a pasture in Kansas or Wyoming.
   Yet, some believe there is a more promising side to this dark
coin, and that there are solutions.
   ``Almost all rural hospitals are losing money as a result of
dramatic declines in use, changes in government funding, and fewer
local doctors,'' says an Agriculture Department report. ``But that
does not mean that rural residents must forgo local medical care.''
   Rural areas can have a strong base for local health care, given
some creativity and persistence, the report said. There are
alternatives to hospitalization, and sometimes to doctors
themselves.
   ``Most patients no longer need a bed in a hospital,'' the report
said. ``And modern emergency care techniques can stabilize patients
for transport to a more distant hospital. Physician assistants and
nurse practitioners can help ease the workload of the local
physicians.''
   The report, ``Rural America and the Revolution in Health Care,''
was written by Jeffrey C. Bauer, a former professor at the
University of Colorado Medical Center, and now head of his own
rural health consulting firm. Co-author Eileen Weis, a registered
nurse, is a strategic planner with the same firm, the Bauer Group
of Hillrose, Colo.
   ``Rural areas today have too few physicians,'' the report said.
``Some areas have none. Unlike their city-based colleagues, many
rural physicians are the only doctor in town, bearing all the
burdens of being on call every evening and every weekend.''
   Moreover, it said, disproportionally large numbers of
government-insured or uninsured patients live in rural areas, and
that means lower income for doctors.
   Faced with career burnout and lower pay, many head for the
cities and more lucrative fields. Hospitals built 30 or 40 years
ago have vacancies galore.
   ``Most small and rural hospitals today fill less than 30 percent
of their beds; 80 percent occupancy levels were common just 10
years ago,'' the report said. ``However, rural communities should
not assume that their hospitals' problems will all be solved if
more doctors move into town or if hospital reimbursement rates are
equalized.''
   One of the basic alternatives has been the development of
primary medical care without putting patients in a hospital bed.
   ``Up-to-date primary care practitioners can meet 80 percent to
90 percent of all health care needs without acute care hospital
beds,'' the report said. ``Technological advances now enable
primary care specialists to provide advanced diagnostic
capabilities in their offices or clinics.''
   Nurse practitioners and doctor assistants can perform many
primary care functions with varying degrees of supervision by
physicians.
   The report said emergency medical services, or EMS, provide the
other key to the future of rural health.
   Because of recent scientific and technological advances, a
modern EMS system ``can actually be better than a typical emergency
room in a rural hospital,'' the report said. With a trained crew
working with a fully equipped modern ambulance, most critically ill
or injured patients can be stabilized at the scene.
   ``Thus, saving a small, rural hospital to preserve emergency
care is not necessarily the best way to keep emergency care in
rural areas,'' the report said. ``In many smaller towns, money
spent toward emergency medical care is better spent on upgraded EMS
capabilities.''
   But talk of closing hospitals can strike nerves, as Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., demonstrated recently during a Veterans Affairs
Committee hearing. Washington policy makers are fundamentally
oblivious to the needs of rural America, he charged.
   ``They really don't understand the sense of space and distance''
in rural areas, Baucus said. The discussion at the time involved
the possibility of closing rural VA hospitals in Montana, a move
ruled out at the hearing by Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski.
   The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association says
expanded medical insurance coverage heads its list of ways to
improve rural health care.
   Bob Bergland, vice president and general manager of the
association, said, ``We want to make sure that the needs of rural
Americans are considered in the current debate on medical insurance
coverage and other health care problems.''
   Bergland, who was secretary of agriculture in the Carter
administration, said rural residents are less likely than city
people to benefit from tax incentives and other programs aimed at
making health care more available and affordable.
   But he added: ``Doctors and nurses will be the first to tell you
that it's not just their numbers that are important for good rural
health care. We've got to assure things like adequate water and
sewer facilities, nutrition education and preventive health care.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction with rates on six-month bills
dropping to their lowest level since July.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.61 percent, down from 7.68 percent
last week. Another $8.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.40 percent, down from 7.51 percent last

   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.52
percent on Oct. 23 and six-month bills averaged 7.35 percent on
July 31.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.86 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,809.80 and 7.79 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,627.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.71
percent last week, down from 7.87 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Justice Department Concerned About Proposed Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says the proposed
merger of the nation's two largest armored-car companies would
reduce competition and should be reviewed carefully.
   The department's views on the proposed purchase of Loomis
Armored Inc. by Brink's Inc., the nation's largest armored car
company, were expressed in a petition to the Interstate Commerce
Commission, which must approve the deal.
   The Justice Department's antitrust division said Monday it
opposed a request by Brink's, a subsidiary of the Pittston Co., for
an exemption from ICC regulatory review of its proposed acquisition
of Loomis, which is owned by Mayne Nickless Ltd. of Melbourne,
Australia.
   The Justice Department urged the ICC to conduct a full hearing
on the antitrust implications of the proposed combination.
   ``There appears to be industrywide concern that the proposed
merger may adversely affect competition,'' the department said in
its complaint to the ICC.
   ``A significant number of customers have told us they would not
be surprised to see prices rise as a result of the merger because
alternatives to service from Brink's or Loomis will either be
unavailable or difficult to obtain,'' the department said.
   In a statement, Assistant Attorney General James F. Rill said
that ``in some major cities, the merger will leave Brink's as the
sole or dominant provider of armored car services.''
   The purchase of Loomis, which is based in Piscataway, N.J., was
announced in September. Terms were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Iacocca: Additional Plant Closings Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sluggish car and truck sales may force
Chrysler Corp. to increase budget cuts above a planned $1 billion
by the end of 1990, and the company may be forced to close assembly
plants, Chairman Lee Iacocca says.
   ``I think the billion is a catalyst to say `You've got to
continue to find efficiencies every day of your life, guys, and it
doesn't stop after you get to $1 billion, you keep going,'''
Iacocca said Monday.
   ``So I think it'd be safe to say the billion is for openers, and
we've probably got another half a billion we're thinking about
already,'' he said.
   Asked whether additional plant closings were likely, he said:
``Maybe. We don't know how deep the recession is yet.''
   Earlier this month, Chrysler said it would stop production of
its Omni and Horizon subcompacts at a Detroit assembly plant in
February.
   The announcement drew heated criticism from the United Auto
Workers union, which planned a demonstration today outside Chrysler
headquarters in Detroit.
   Iacocca held a brief news conference Monday after a luncheon
during which Allstate Insurance Co. presented the nation's No. 3
automaker with its Safety Leadership Award. Chrysler is the first
U.S. automaker to make driver's-side air bags a standard feature on
all U.S.-made cars for the 1990 model year.
   Iacocca said closing the Jefferson Avenue plant in Detroit was
necessary, and he denied it violated the letter or spirit of the
UAW contract with Chrysler.
   ``The cars aren't selling, and we couldn't have the people come
in and dust off the plant or go bowling inside the plant,'' he
said. ``The contract language is pretty clear: If the people aren't
buying the cars you're building, then people have to go home.''
   An optimistic prediction for 1990 car and truck sales
industry-wide would be 14.5 million, Iacocca said, ``but things are
little grim at the moment.'' He said the auto industry was in a
recession.
   General Motors Corp. officials have predicted total 1990 car and
truck sales of about 15 million vehicles. Ford Motor Co. executives
have withheld predictions until later this year.
   In his luncheon remarks, Iacocca called Chrysler's decision to
offer standard driver's-side air bags a gamble that the public
would be willing to pay hundreds of dollars extra per car for
additional safety.
   ``I don't know if the American public is totally sold on this
idea,'' he said. ``I hope the jury's not out too long, 'cause I'm
liable to get crushed.''
   Under federal law, all cars made in the United States after last
Sept. 1 must have either an air bag or automatic seatbelt on the
driver's side.
   Meanwhile Monday, GM said it planned to more than double the
number of air bag-equipped cars it produces, increasing to 1.3
million for the 1991 model year.
   GM President Robert C. Stempel said driver's-side air bags would
be standard on 13 of the automaker's 1991 models, including the
Chevrolet Corsica, Buick Electra and Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight.
   GM is including driver's-side air bags on about 500,000 of its
1990 cars. The safety device is standard equipment on 13 models for
the current year, including the Buick Reatta, Cadillac Allante,
Chevrolet Camaro and Geo Metro. Air bags were optional on some
1988- and 1989-model GM cars.
   ``Following our announced plan to phase in air bags on our
passenger cars, the 1992 model year will include passenger-side
protection on some models,'' Stempel added. ``Assuming normal
market conditions, we could be in the 2.7 million range by 1994.''
   Chrysler and Ford Motor Co. each are producing 1 million 1990
cars with driver's-side air bags.

<TEXT>
   OPEC faces a ticklish situation at this
week's much-anticipated meeting.
   The dilemma involves devising a way to stop the cheating by OPEC
members who want a higher quota, boosting oil prices a bit and
setting a production ceiling in line with consumer demand.
   Whatever the cartel ultimately decides, ``it's going to be a
very difficult meeting,'' predicts Pierre Terzian, editor of
Petrostrategies, an oil newsletter based in Paris.
   Oil prices are holding steady even though some members are
openly cheating on their production quotas. OPEC is producing at
the highest level since 1981.
   On Saturday, the 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries are scheduled to meet to decide their strategy
for next year.
   If the ministers raise OPEC's output ceiling too high, ``they're
running the risk of jeopardizing the whole party,'' warns Peter
Gignoux, the international energy director for Shearson Lehman
Hutton in London.
   On Thursday, OPEC's eight-member monitoring panel will begin
laying the groundwork for the meeting, to be held in Vienna,
Austria.
   Just a year ago, oil prices were in the doldrums. The average
price of seven crudes monitored by OPEC was $12.34 a barrel, well
under the cartel's target of $18. West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark American crude, fell to $12.60.
   Since then, prices have risen sharply. Last week, the OPEC
basket was at $17.76 a barrel. It briefly topped the $18 mark last
spring.
   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate have been about $20 a
barrel. Middle Eastern varieties are several dollars a barrel below
that.
   Early in the year, the oil-producing nations curbed their
production to help drive up prices. But in recent months, they have
turned their taps wider, without hurting prices, thanks to soaring
demand in developing countries.
   ``This is not a bad deal,'' said Gignoux.
   Ian Graham, an analyst at County NatWest in London, said,
``There's not the same pressure to come up with a novel
compromise.''
   Terzian estimated OPEC production climbed to 23.4 million
barrels a day last month, with big surges by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates. The output was well over the cartel's
ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day for the last quarter of this
year.
   Not since the spring of 1981 has OPEC produced so much,
according to figures from the International Energy Agency. Its
output amounted to 23.2 million barrels a day in the second quarter
of that year.
   Analysts say the cartel's luck may not hold next year when
demand for OPEC oil is expected to slip, due partly to seasonal
factors and saturated storage tanks.
   The International Energy Agency predicted earlier this month
that demand for OPEC crude in the first half of 1990 would be
slightly under 21 million barrels a day.
   If so, the cartel would have to cut current output to keep
prices steady.
   ``The problem is ... getting production down so it doesn't
oversupply the market,'' said Graham.
   To do that will require hard bargaining.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been flagrantly
violating their quotas, the individual supply targets set by the
cartel for each member, to press their demands for a larger share
of the output total.
   Terzian estimated the two countries each were producing more
than 2 million barrels a day last month, about double their
production caps.
   He said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, lifted
about 5.6 million barrels a day in October, higher than its quota
of 5 million barrels.
   Analysts believe the Saudis, as a negotiating tactic before this
week's meetings, have decided to pump more to try to maintain their
share of the cartel's increased production. Saudi Arabia is
assigned about a quarter of the total output.
   Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer has said he would not give up
any of his country's share.
   At talks in Geneva in late September the ministers seriously
considered an Iranian proposal to meet the demands for bigger
chunks of the production pie by Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates. The ministers were expected to renew those discussions
this week.
   Under Iran's plan, the cartel's production ceiling would rise to
21.5 million barrels a day to cover the requests of Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates for higher shares. Gabon and Ecuador also
would get more.
   Smaller shares would be parceled out to Algeria, Indonesia,
Nigeria and Venezuela. Iran and Iraq also would lose a bit. Saudi
Arabia, Libya and Qatar would stay the same.

<HEAD>Duties to be Hiked on Japanese, Taiwanese Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission has
ruled that several small business telephone systems made in Japan
and Taiwan are being sold here at unfairly low prices, causing harm
to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and smaller U.S.
manufacturers.
   The decision Monday opened the way for U.S. Customs starting
next month to start collecting ``dumping'' duties of more than 100
percent from importers of one Taiwan maker and several Japanese
makers.
   That is expected to result in higher prices for the systems in
this country or fewer imports, or a combination of both.
   The six-member commission voted 3-3 on an anti-dumping petition
filed by two U.S. makers, AT&amp;T and Comdial Corp. of
Charlottesville, Va. The tie vote means acceptance of their claims.
   The Commerce Department, which earlier ruled that office phone
systems with from two to 256 lines were being ``dumped'' in this
country, will instruct U.S. customs in the first part of December
to start depositing higher duties, officials said.
   The decision in a similar case involving imported South Korean
telephone equipment was postponed for 60 days at the request of the
Korean manufacturers, they reported.
   The ``dumping margin'' on Japanese imports, to be reflected in
higher duties, was fixed by Commerce at 179 percent for products of
Matsushita Electric, 137 percent for those of Toshiba Electric and
158 percent for all others.
   The margin on Nitsukoi products from Taiwan was set for 130
percent, while the Commerce Department found no ``dumping margin''
for other Taiwanese brands.
   U.S. small business telephone systems are made mostly in the
states of Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Mississippi and Colorado, the
ITC said.
   AT&amp;T welcomed the commission decision, declaring in a statement
that ``we are confident that all U.S. manufacturers can be very
successful in this market once unlawful pricing ends.'' It added
that the decision will enable AT&amp;T to ``continue to be able to
bring its innovative strength to this marketplace and bring new,
even more innovative solitions to small business customer needs.''

<TEXT>
   The music is still playing in the marathon
contest for control of LIN Broadcasting Corp., and neither suitor
is ready to give up.
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., which started the dance with
an unsolicited buyout offer in early June, said Monday it was
increasing its cash tender offer for a controlling interest in LIN
by $625 million to $3.4 billion.
   McCaw also said that if its offer succeeded, it would have LIN
borrow $425 million to buy McCaw stock which then would be
distributed to remaining LIN shareholders.
   ``Our amended offer, which has a value more than $800 million
higher than our earlier offer, is clearly the superior alternative
for LIN's shareholders,'' said McCaw's chairman and chief
executive, Craig O. McCaw.
   The alternative is a competing offer from BellSouth Corp., the
Atlanta-based regional telephone company that has agreed to merge
its cellular telephone operations with LIN's cellular business.
   New York-based LIN said its board would review the revised
proposal ``on a timely basis,'' but urged its shareholders against
tendering to McCaw until its board announced its recommendation.
   BellSouth said it was studying the revised offer but that its
first reading indicated its own deal with LIN offered more
``strength and value'' to LIN shareholders.
   Analysts said they valued McCaw's new offer at $123 to $128 a
share, compared with $110 to $113 a share under McCaw's previous
offer and $117 to $124 a share under the BellSouth offer.
   ``I am sure that BellSouth will come back with a higher offer,''
said Geoffrey Johnson, telecommunications analyst for Argus
Research Corp.
   In over-the-counter trading, LIN climbed $4.37{ a share to close
at $120.12{, while McCaw fell $1.25 to $35.75. BellSouth rose 50
cents a share to $51.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   McCaw, based in Kirkland, Wash., asked LIN to put its new offer
to a vote at the previously scheduled Jan. 12 meeting, at which
LIN's shareholders are being asked to consider BellSouth's offer.
   McCaw said that if LIN refuses, it intends to ``take our case
directly to the LIN stockholders'' by mounting a proxy fight for
control of the LIN board.
   McCaw is the nation's largest cellular company, but LIN's plan
to merge its cellular operations with those of BellSouth would
create a cellular company larger than McCaw.
   Under its latest offer, McCaw said it would pay $150 a share for
22.5 million LIN shares, or $3.4 billion. Its previous offer was
$125 per share for 22 million shares, a total of $2.75 billion.
   McCaw already owns about 5.1 million LIN shares, and the revised
offer would give it 51.2 percent of LIN's 53.9 million shares.
   In addition, McCaw said that as soon as possible after the
tender offer is completed McCaw would have LIN buy $425 million of
McCaw stock and distribute it to LIN shareholders, at a value of
$16.17 in stock for each LIN share held.
   The new offer expires at midnight EST Dec. 15, although it would
be extended until the LIN shareholder meeting if LIN puts the bid
to a vote.
   Under the deal with BellSouth, LIN shareholders would get a cash
dividend of $42 a share, stock in the new cellular company that
would be created by the merger of LIN and BellSouth cellular
interests and stock in a new company that would consist of LIN's
seven television stations.
   The participants in both deals have offered guarantees that LIN
shareholders who hold on to their stock in the cellular company
will get private market value for it several years down the road.
   BellSouth and LIN said in announcing their merger plan in
October that they felt the deal could be closed in the first
quarter of 1990.
   McCaw said regulatory approvals could delay the BellSouth-LIN
deal for up to a year. McCaw said its deal could be closed much
sooner and said it would demonstrate its confidence in that by
paying interest of 12 percent annually on its cash tender offer if
the offer closes after March 31, 1990.
   McCaw said last week it has received firm commitments totaling
$3 billion from a 22-bank syndicate, which, with about $1.2 billion
of its own cash and marketable securities, is enough to complete
the tender offer.

<HEAD>Shearson Commission Reduction Could Herald More Wall Street Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dramatic reduction in stockbroker commissions
by Wall Street's second-largest firm heralds further retrenchment
during an industrywide slowdown in brokerage activity by individual
investors, analysts say.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. announced a rollback Monday of 1 to
2 percentage points for 1990 in the portion of the commission a
broker gets for selling investment products. It was Shearson's
first commission cut in 15 years.
   ``That amounts to a lot of money when it gets all done,'' said
an official at one large Wall Street firm who asked not to be
identified. ``I'm surprised at that.''
   Analysts said the reduction was the first direct commission
cutback in the last year by a brokerage house.
   Business has lagged on Wall Street partly because of an exodus
of individual investors since the October 1987 stock market crash,
and firms have laid off thousands of employees in an effort to save
money.
   Brokerages also have imposed a variety of customer fees that go
directly to the brokerage but do not affect the size of brokers'
commissions. But firms such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's
biggest brokerage, and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said Monday they
do not plan to reduce broker commissions.
   Such fees result in ``a slightly higher take for the company
than it does for the representative, but it's not as brutal as
this,'' said James P. Hanbury, a securities industry analyst with
Wertheim Schroeder Inc.
   ``You're trying to raise the revenue to the firm because the
overall business is not that robust,'' he said.
   Hanbury said he expected other Wall Street houses to cut
commissions. ``Either the business gets better or you're going to
see it, and I think you're going to see it,'' he said.
   Shearson, which is 61 percent owned by American Express Co., has
been contemplating trimming the commission a broker gets, known as
the payout rate, by 4 to 5 percentage points over the next four to
five years, Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said.
   In 1989, Shearson retail brokers brought in commissions
averaging $228,000. Shearson returned 46.5 percent of the total to
brokers and their supervisors in the form of direct payments,
employee benefits and deferred payments.
   In 1986, when an average Shearson retail broker brought in
$265,000 in commissions, the payout rate was 43 percent. Wall
Street officials said most firms' payout rates were are about 37
percent.
   Shearson, stung by declining profits and a low stock price,
announced earlier this month it was laying off up to 800 employees
and restructuring its senior management.
   While not slashing commissions, virtually all Wall Street firms
have imposed ``handling'' fees on customer accounts to help enhance
revenue without boosting expenses.
   Earlier this month, for example, Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. imposed a
$2.50 handling charge on all individual investors' stock and bond
trades. Merrill Lynch boosted its service charge last year to $2.35
for each trade from $1.85.
   The Securities Industry Association expects third-quarter
industry pre-tax profits to be about half of the $1 billion in
pre-tax profits in the second quarter.
   The second-quarter profit marked a sharp jump from $200 million
in the previous quarter and was attributed to increased volume and
declining interest rates. The bulk of the recovery came from the 10
largest investment banks, which recovered from $63 million in
first-quarter losses.
   But retail commissions accounted for just 17 percent of revenue
in the first half of the year, unchanged from 1988 but down 25
percent from 1987 and 35 percent from 1980.
   The Shearson cut is expected to hurt the firm in hiring new
stockbrokers. Shearson was one of several Wall Street firms to
reduce its in-house broker training programs after the 1987 crash
in favor of recruiting from other firms. Officials said they
expected some brokers to leave the company in protest.
   ``It's difficult to go to the troops in a tough market where
they're breaking their backs and say we're cutting you,'' the Wall
Street official said. ``The last people you want to go to is the
producers.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Discuss Bills To Curb Corporate Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation concerned with the problems caused
by corporate takeovers has been introduced by at least four
senators sponsoring separate bills.
   The Senate Banking Committee's securities subcommittee heard
testimony Monday about bills that seek to curb takeovers and
leveraged buyouts while protecting shareholders' rights.
   The senators appearing before the subcommittee were Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, Terry Sanford, D-N.C., Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
and Richard Shelby, D-Ala.
   Many in Congress are concerned that the wave of hostile
takeovers, mergers and acquisitions and corporate raids for profit
are hurting the economy and turning American management's attention
away from long-term planning.
   The subcommittee chairman, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.,
said he and the ranking Republican, Sen. John Heinz of
Pennsylvania, called the hearing ``to provide a record for
consideration of these measures in the next session.''
   Congressional leaders were trying to wrap up business this week
so they could adjourn for the holidays until January.
   All four bills would limit or close the 10-day window stock
purchasers have to declare their intentions after they buy 5
percent or more of a company's stock.
   Under the Williams Act, anyone acquiring 5 percent of a
company's stock must disclose their holdings and whether they
intend a takeover within 10 days in a Securities and Exchange
Commission document known as a 13-D.
   Most of the bills would cut that 10-day period to curtail what
Specter called ``creeping takeovers.''
   ``Because the individual can continue purchasing shares during
the 10-day period,'' he said, ``his or her ownership can greatly
exceed 5 percent by the time the public actually is informed.''
   His bill would require disclosure within 48 hours. Sanford's
would cut it to five days. The five-day limit would kick in if the
purchaser acquires more than 5 percent in Shelby's bill. And
Metzenbaum's bill would cut the limit to 4 percent and require
diclosure within one day.
   The senators also want to curb the practice of paying
``greenmail.''
   ``Too often a raider making a play for a company becomes rich
when a corporation is forced to buy its own stock at a premium,''
said Metzenbaum. ``It's blackmail, but we've made it more dignified
and call it `greenmail,''' he added.
   His bill would prohibit the payment of greenmail unless approved
by a majority of those holding the outstanding voting securities of
the issuer.
   He and other senators said small shareholders often don't have
enough say in whether greenmail should be paid.
   Shelby's bill would allow a company to recover any profit made
by a person who sells the company its own stock if that person
holds more than 3 percent of the company's stock and has held it
for less than a year.
   Specter's bill combined elements of the two bills _ allowing a
company to recover its greenmanil payments, unless the payments
were approved by a vote of the majority of the aggregate
outstanding voting securities of the issuer.
   Sanford said, ``We need to shift the debate and focus our
legislation away from the old `raiders' versus `entrenched
management' fight to the more fundamental problems of encouraging
corporate management to manage for the long term and encouraging
investors to take a longer-term view.''
   His bill would treat 5 percent holders of a company's stock as
`insiders' and block their ability to make a profit on stock of the
company bought or sold within a six-month period.

   One week swinging a machete in the
scorching sugar cane fields hardened William Paul's hands and his
resolve.
   ``If I knew it would be like this I would have stayed home,''
said the 25-year-old father who grows yams and peas on the
Caribbean island of St. Lucia. ``To me it's not worth six months
from home. It's like slavery.''
   But Fray Clinton, who stays in another of the U.S. Sugar Corp.
bunkhouses, has returned to cut cane since 1984. He boasts of the
cash in his Jamaican bank account and the new clothes and household
items he can afford.
   ``No one promised no easy work,'' he said. ``I got no
complaints.''
   Seasonal laborers from the Caribbean have been coming to south
Florida cane fields since the 1940s. But a recent book critical of
the program and congressional review of the nation's sugar policies
have drawn attention to the cutters' lives.
   In ``Big Sugar?'' author Alex Wilkinson describes the sugar cane
fields south of Lake Okeechobee as a place of misery, where poorly
paid cutters struggle in Spartan camps run by profit-minded
companies.
   ``The most perilous work in America is the harvest of sugar cane
in south Florida,'' he wrote.
   Sugar industry operators and officials dismiss the book as
misleading and inaccurate.
   Walking through U.S. Sugar's Pelican Lake workers' camp near
Pahokee on the southeast shore of Lake Okeechobee, Earle Whyte
shakes his head at the suggestions of enslavement.
   ``Every year we have people on the islands begging, crying for
these jobs,'' said Whyte, senior liaison officer of the West Indies
Central Labour Organization.
   The camp, considered by workers to be better than most, is a
collection of concrete-block buildings, each housing 22 cutters on
bunk beds. A dining hall and store are near the main road, although
the cutters can travel the 10 miles into Pahokee to shop or eat.
   Sweat-stained clothes are draped outside nearly every building.
   ``This is tough work, no doubt,'' said Bob Lee, vice president
of personnel for U.S. Sugar, the nation's oldest cane refiner.
``The nature of this work probably brings a little more discontent
than others.''
   At least twice during the past decade, cutters have challenged
their conditions. In November 1986, police riot squads were called
to take away more than 300 Okeelanta Sugar Corp. employees who
stopped work in a wage protest; workers were returned to the
islands. A smaller incident occurred in 1982 with workers also
being sent home.
   In pale dawn light on a recent day, Alfred Blake and the rest of
the Osceola Farms cutters rise in the barracks. Over their work
clothes they strap on metal shin and hand guards.
   By bus they travel to the field, burned the day before to remove
excess leaves from the stalks. Blake's machete slices easily
through five or six stalks at a time. The tops are also hacked off.
The harvest is piled on the chocolate-colored soil, sometimes alive
with aggressive fire ants.
   By noon break, Blake has made about $25 at the minimum rate of
$5.30 an hour. A $51-a-week food charge is taken out of his pay.
Clothing and other needs are his own responsibility.
   ``Yeah, it's hard _ very hard _ to save any money,'' said Blake,
23. ``My friends had come before and I wanted to experience it. We
have no good jobs in Jamaica. We got no choice but to cut cane and
do such things.''
   Blake arrived in Florida last month after picking apples in New
England, where orchards bring foreign workers in under the same
special immigration rule.
   This year, about 9,000 cane cutters _ mostly Jamaicans _ came to
Florida under the program, which pays for transportation to and
from the islands. That's about 900 fewer than last year due to the
expanded use of mechanical harvesters in the 413,000 acres of sugar
cane fields. Florida is the nation's largest sugar cane producer.
   Growers, however, say full mechanization of the harvest is not
in sight. The cutters can work in muck areas not accessible to the
giant machines. In other sugar cane states _ Hawaii, Louisiana and
Texas _ most harvesting is done by machine.
   Congress is expected early next year to scrutinize the
cane-cutter program during hearings on the farm bill, which sets
import quotas on foreign sugar. The bill is scheduled to expire
next year.
   In the fields, however, the concerns are much more immediate:
food, injuries and saving money.
   Jamaican Levi Graham rested on a pile of cut cane after a
six-hour work day. Sweat covered his arms and face.
   ``It's not a place you want to be, these fields. I liked doing
the apples, but the cane is a tough thing,'' said Graham, 25, on
his fifth harvest season. ``We must come or stay in Jamaica and
look for a job. It's better than staying home.''

<HEAD>Creditors' Agreement Staves Off Liquidation Order in Hunt Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former billionaire brothers William Herbert Hunt
and Nelson Bunker Hunt could emerge from bankruptcy before the end
of December following a compromise reached by major creditors.
   As a federal bankruptcy judge poised to convert the Chapter 11
bankruptcies of one of William Herbert Hunt to a Chapter 7
liquidation, spokesmen for two creditors, Minpeco S.A. and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of New York, announced Monday they
agreed on settlement terms.
   Terms were not disclosed, however.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson emerged from hours of
closed-door meetings to announce he would defer until Dec. 15
signing the order. If the agreement breaks down, Abramson could
proceed with liquidation.
   Abramson notified all parties two weeks ago that without an
agreement by Nov. 20 he would convert the case to a Chapter 7.
   Under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, a debtor is allowed
to continue to operate with protection from creditors' claims while
a debt repayment schedule is arranged. Under Chapter 7, assets are
sold to repay creditors.
   According to bankruptcy court filings, Herbert lists $169
million in assets and Bunker lists assets of $250 million.
   ``We couldn't be happier,'' said Stephen McCartin, head attorney
for Herbert Hunt, who had asked for a delay in Abramson's
conversion order.
   The compromise between Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Minpeco,
a mining company owned by the Peruvian government, refocuses both
cases toward a more orderly reorganization away from chapter
liquidation feared by creditors.
   Major creditors said they would have received nothing under a
fire-sale Chapter 7 liquidation, and most of the money from the two
brothers' estates would have gone to the Internal Revenue Service,
which claims 80 percent of Herbert Hunt's assets and 70 percent of
Bunker Hunt's.
   Four of the largest creditors in the case _ Manufacturers
Hanover, Minpeco, the IRS and the trustee for Hunt International
Resources Co. _ said they and the debtors would file joint plans of
reorganization today in Abramson's court.
   Minpeco has been trying to collect a $132 million judgment
against the brothers stemming from the 1979-80 silver market
collapse. With attorneys' fees and interest, the judgment has
swelled to more than $250 million.
   Other creditors _ led by Manufacturers Hanover, which is owed
$36 million _ argued that Minpeco already has recovered its silver
losses from other third-party defendants and that the money would
be better spent paying other creditors.

   Sony Corp.'s profit soared more than 68 percent in
the first half of fiscal 1989 amid booming sales overseas, the
company said Tuesday.
   Net income for Sony and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled
49.062 billion yen, or about $340 million using Tuesday's
dollar-yen exchange rate, up from 29.183 billion yen a year earlier.
   Sales rose to 1.229 trillion yen, up 23.8 percent from 992.260
billion yen in the comparable year-earlier period.
   Domestic sales continued to make up the largest part of Sony's
overall sales in the six months. But despite booming personal
spending in Japan, Sony marked up its strongest sales gains
overseas, particularly in Europe.
   European sales jumped 30.3 percent to 285.381 billion yen from
218.962 billion yen a year earlier.
   Sales in the United States climbed 26.5 percent to 365.140
billion yen from 281.586 billion yen, while sales inside Japan
increased a more moderate 16 percent to 390.911 billion yen from
336.973 billion yen.
   Sales of recordings by Sony's subsidiary CBS Records Inc. rose
18.8 percent to 192.838 billion yen from 162.382 billion yen.

<TEXT>
   Thrift regulator M. Danny Wall, acknowledging
mistakes in his handling of the nation's largest savings and loan
failure, today vigorously defended his overall performance and
declared, ``No political figure influenced my decisions.''
   ``We have all learned some tough lessons from this case. We made
some mistakes, and in retrospect, we would do some things
differently,'' Wall said in testimony prepared for delivery under
oath to the House Banking Committee.
   The panel, chaired by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, was
conducting the last of six scheduled hearings investigating the
collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Gonzalez, in an opening statement, chastized Wall for rejecting
a 1987 recommendation from field examiners in San Francisco who
wanted to seize Lincoln.
   San Francisco ``sounded an eight-alarm warning ... (but) for 23
months and two weeks (Washington) failed to take definitive and
effective action,'' he said.
   The committee also planned to hear from the thrift's owner,
Charles H. Keating Jr., but it was unclear whether Keating would
refuse to testify by asserting his constitutional protection
against self-incrimination.
   Keating, a Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire, is the target of a
federal grand jury probe and of a $1.1 billion fraud and
racketeering suit filed by regulators. Congressional sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said his attorneys were
advising him to remain silent today.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, who has been critical of Wall at
times, drew a contrast between the regulator and Keating.
   ``Danny Wall has made a career of public service, while Mr.
Keating has made a career of self-service,'' he said.
   Democrats on the committee have been focusing on Wall's
performance, while Republicans also have used the sessions to bring
out the role of five senators, four of them senior Democrats, who
intervened on Lincoln's behalf after accepting $1.3 million in
political contributions from Keating.
   They met with regulators on Lincoln's behalf in April 1987,
three months before Wall took office as chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, now called the Office of Thrift Supervision.
The five are: Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain,
R-Ariz.
   Wall said in his formal testimony that he had no direct
knowledge of that incident. But he declared, ``My decisions in the
Lincoln case were my own. They were devoid of any political
influence. I was not under the spell of Charles Keating.''
   Wall has acknowledged receiving calls concerning Lincoln from
three members of Congress _ DeConcini, Cranston and Rep. Carroll
Hubbard, D-Ky. But he said, ``Those calls were well within the
limits of propriety.''
   ``Their inquiries were for a status report or to urge action,
but in no way were they attempts to tell me what action to take,''
Wall said.
   Hubbard, in an emotional defense of himself, told the Banking
Committee he made the call at a request of former Rep. John
Rouselot, R-Calif., who was then seeking to arrange the sale of
Lincoln.
   ``I have no relationship with Mr. Charles Keating,'' he said,
adding, ``I'm proud to call Danny Wall my friend.''
   The chief thrift regulator's defense comes after weeks of
critical testimony and may be too late to secure his political
future. In response to a call from Gonzalez for Wall's resignation,
President Bush said a week ago he was ``not closing the door'' on
the Wall's departure. Bush added he would make changes if it is
proven that regulators were not aggressive enough.
   Much of the testimony in the previous five all-day hearings has
concentrated on why Wall rejected a 1987 recommendation from
examiners in his regional office to seize Lincoln and put a stop to
unsound practices.
   Instead, Wall transferred the jurisdiction over Lincoln from San
Francisco to agency headquarters in Washington and ordered a second
examination, delaying Lincoln's seizure until April of this year.
   Gonzalez blames the regulator for the delay, which he says
ballooned the expected $2 billion cost of the failure.
   Wall's prepared testimony rejected that, saying his decisions,
at most, delayed action less than six months, adding, ``The
preponderance of the losses at Lincoln was embedded prior to the
time I became chairman of the bank board.''
   However, he admitted he should have insisted officials from the
San Francisco case participate in the second examination of
Lincoln, even though he still believes their first examination did
not turn up enough information to legally justify seizing Lincoln.
   ``The San Francisco examiners found smoke, but no fire,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, a class-action federal lawsuit was filed in Los
Angeles on Monday by Lincoln investors seeking to freeze more than
$100 million in investor funds that they contend were illegally
transported overseas.
   The lawsuit contends Lincoln misled 22,000 investors into buying
nearly $200 million in nonrated high-risk securities. The suit
contends Keating and his family converted the funds to their own
use by investing them in banks and companies in Switzerland, the
Bahamas and Panama. A court hearing was scheduled for Dec. 4.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as the
markets struggled to recover from Monday's weak close.
   Follow-through selling provided much of the downward pressure
but losses were limited by an Agriculture Department report that a
near-record amount of corn was inspected for export last week and
by a downward revision in a private estimate of U.S. stocks of
soybean oil.
   The USDA said late Monday it inspected 71.38 million bushels of
corn for export during the week ending last Thursday compared with
60.87 million the previous week and 46.41 million for the same week
a year ago.
   The National Oilseed Processers Association announced it had
revised its estimate of U.S. soybean oil stocks as of the end of
October to 378 million pounds from 442 million pounds.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to } cent

unchanged to 1 cent lower with December at $2.37\ a bushel; oats
were 1 cent lower to { cent higher with December at $1.44{ a

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

75.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with November at 83.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .03
cent to .33 cent lower with December at 49.20 cents a pound; frozen

   Georgia Gulf Corp. said today it has decided
against a merger with NL Industries, the Houston-based company
controlled by billionaire Harold Simmons that had made a $1.1
billion takeover offer.
   The Atlanta-based chemical manufacturing company said in a
statement that recapitalizing by borrowing more money would be the
best way to increase its stock value.
   Georgia Gulf had hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to advise it on
options after NL made its initial offer in August. Alternatives
included recapitalization, a merger or some other transaction
involving a third party.
   NL made its latest offer, worth $50 a share, in October.
   Georgia Gulf said in the statement that ``its representatives
have concluded discussions with third parties who had indicated an
interest in a possible business combination with or acquisition of
Georgia Gulf.''
   No details of the possible recapitalization were disclosed. The
company said a special meeting of stockholders would be called once
the arrangements are worked out.
   J. Landis Martin, president of NL, was out of his office this
morning and could not be reached immediately for comment.

   Congressional leaders worked today at
smoothing rough edges in a $14.8 billion budget-cutting package and
completing a separate measure eliminating some Medicare benefits.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters ``a few
glitches have developed today'' in efforts to pass the
deficit-reduction measure quickly. But aides said the problem was
not serious and would not prevent Congress from approving the
measure quickly and adjourning for the year.
   ``I think it is just a question of getting everything down,''
said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``There's a
lot of complex drafting and talking taking place. It takes a while
to get it done.''
   House and Senate leaders of both parties shook hands on the
budget plan shortly after midnight. The package derives about $4.6
billion, nearly one-third of its savings, from across-the-board
cuts in most federal programs. They predicted quick approval by the
full chambers and the signature of President Bush.
   ``It will pass overwhelmingly, I think, in both bodies because
it's a pretty good'' savings measure, Rep. Bill Frenzel of
Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, told
reporters.
   ``It is a very strong, effective deficit-reduction package,''
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told his
colleagues.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said White House Budget
Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady had
told him that ``the White House will support this package.''
   The agreement, forged after weeks of closed-door talks, puts to
rest a budget year that has seen almost continual clashes between
Bush and congressional Democrats. Despite a springtime budget
agreement that both sides thought would smooth their work, ongoing
battles _ largely involving the president's unsuccessful quest to
shrink capital gains tax rates _ were the dominant theme.
   Nonetheless, optimism reigned in the Capitol that this year's
session would end today. By Monday evening, a telephone tape
recording that normally provides scheduling information for
Republicans was playing a song called ``One More Day'' from the
musical ``Les Miserables.''
   The budget-cutting compromise includes about $5.7 billion in new
taxes, most of them on corporations.
   One change affecting many wage-earners would include deferred
compensation _ such as the earnings some employees place into
401(k) retirement plans _ in the formula that determines the amount
of wages subject to Social Security taxes. That could require
workers in the $50,000 range to pay Social Security tax on slightly
more of their earnings beginning in 1990.
   That item, agreed to toward the end of the bipartisan
negotiations, would raise $400 million this year.
   The bill also claims about $4.6 billion in savings by leaving
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law's cuts in most federal
programs in effect through the first week in February. Those
spending slashes took effect Oct. 1, when Bush and Congress failed
to agree on reducing the federal shortfall, which congressional
analysts project will surpass $140 billion this year.
   The bill's across-the-board cuts would result in reductions of
about 1.8 percent in domestic programs and 1.6 percent in defense
spending, according to Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
   Other savings would come from other selected spending cutbacks
and from a series of accounting shifts.
   Negotiators agreed to add to the bill a provision dramatically
revising the government's system of reimbursing doctors for
services to Medicare patients. The change will hold down medical
costs in the long run and help assure that high-quality medical
services are available to rural areas and inner cities, according
to two sponsors, Sens. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and David
Durenberger, R-Minn.
   The plan establishes a national fee schedule based on costs of
providing services. Physicians now are reimbursed on the basis of
historical fee patterns that often have little relationship to
costs of providing care.
   Separately, lawmakers hoped to close another elusive deal on
repealing all _ or part _ of the newly enacted Medicare coverage of
the costs of extremely long illnesses.
   The benefit was created just last year with popular support,
with proponents trumpeting a bill that would prevent the sick
elderly from being driven into poverty by doctor bills.
   But many seniors have rebelled because many of them will have to
pay a surtax to pay for the program. That tax reaches $800 this
year for the 40 percent of them with the most financial resources.
   The House has been insisting for weeks that the entire program
be repealed, while the Senate wants to spare minor benefits, such
as coverage for hospital costs. Lawmakers insist they will do
something before they leave town, rather than face furious
constituents.
   In other business Monday, Congress returned the final three 1990
spending bills to Bush for his signature, all of which he had
vetoed at least in part for abortion provisions.
   These included a $14.6 billion foreign aid bill, a $156.7
billion measure for health and welfare programs, and one providing
$500 million for Washington, D.C.'s budget. Lawmakers, realizing
they could not override another Bush veto, stripped the abortion
language from each measure.
   Should Congress leave town before Thanksgiving, it would be only
the second time it had done so in a non-election year since 1965,
the last time being 1983.

   Machinists on strike for 48 days against Boeing
head back to work Wednesday after overwhelmingly approving a
three-year contract that could become the standard for the
aerospace industry.
   A company spokesman today said he hoped for a speedy return to
full production at the world's No. 1 maker of passenger jets, but a
union head predicted operations would be slowed for as long as a
year because of lingering resentment.
   ``I think that it's going to take awhile for the company to get
their production back up to speed as they'd like it,'' said Tom
Baker, president of District Lodge 751 of the Machinists union.
   More than eight in 10 Boeing workers voted in favor of the
contract Monday night, Baker said.
   The strike affected more than 57,000 workers in nine states. It
came as the company had a record backlog of aircraft orders of more
than a decade, in part because airlines are replacing their aging
fleets.
   ``I talked to my supervisor yesterday and, actually, it's a big
relief,'' said Carla Bowman, who tests new equipment and writes
operating manuals at Boeing's suburban Auburn plant.
   ``There's no bitterness. When you're on strike, you're on
strike. But when you go back, you go in there and work hard,'' she
said today.
   A settlement with Boeing Machinists traditionally sets the
pattern for other aerospace companies, especially Lockheed Corp.
and McDonnell Douglas Corp., as well as for other unions at Boeing
divisions.
   ``The 1989 strike will be remembered as the strongest and best
strike in our history,'' Baker told union members as they gathered
to vote in Seattle's Kingdome. ``I knew you wouldn't back down.''
   Union members also met in Wichita, Kan., and in Portland, Ore.,
to approve the settlement and end the second-longest strike against
Boeing.
   Boeing spokesman Russ Young said company supervisors and
managers would spend today planning for the workers' return, with
Wednesday devoted mostly to regrouping. Boeing shuts down nearly
all operations Thursday through Sunday for Thanksgiving.
   ``We're going to put everything we can into getting back on
schedule,'' Young said. ``From day one we said that this is going
to impact us, so the opportunity to get everybody back as soon as
possible has been important from day one.''
   Average wages will increase $1.14 an hour in the first year and
$3.24 an hour over three years, not counting lump sum bonuses,
Baker said. Current hourly wages range from $8.88 to $18.42.
   Before the vote, cheers and boos rang out as union leaders
entered the Kingdome.
   But in contrast to an Oct. 3 meeting, during which members
rejected a Boeing offer and approved the strike, only a few members
threw paper airplanes made from pages of the contract offer.
   Owen Nissen, 62, who has worked for 20 years for Boeing, said it
was easy for him to vote for the new pact because he was close to
retirement, but he expected even the most militant strikers to go
along as well.
   ``I think everybody wants to go back to work because they have
to make car payments, house payments, buy groceries ... and they're
thinking about Christmas,'' he said.
   Ray Mooney, 30, an inspector in Everett with 11 years at Boeing,
said the contract is ``just a little better. ... Too many people
are hurting too much'' to vote no.
   Negotiators agreed on the proposal early Sunday after 14 hours
of talks.
   The union represents about 57,800 Boeing workers, including
43,300 in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, and 1,700 in
Portland. A few hundred more work at scattered sites in California,
Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and other states.
   The contract contained annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3
percent and 3 percent, the same as in the Oct. 3 and Nov. 4 offers.
   Baker said the contract substantially improved two earlier
offers. The new pact includes:
   _Lump sum bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year, 5
percent the second and 4 percent the third. On Wednesday, most
workers will receive a $500 advance on their bonus.
   _A reduction in mandatory overtime to two consecutive weekends
and 144 hours per quarter with double-time pay after 160 hours.
   Boeing had record earnings in its most recent quarter and holds
a backlog of more than 1,700 jets worth about $85 billion, with
delivery dates stretching beyond the turn of the century.
   The strike virtually halted production at Boeing, delaying
deliveries to airlines at a time of growing passenger loads and
rising concern over aging jets.
   Using supervisory and non-striking workers, Boeing delivered 23
planes during the strike, but all were virtually complete before
the walkout.
   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, ended after 45 days. Its
longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948.

   An investment group headed by Texas financier
Robert M. Bass said today it has acquired a 5.9 percent stake in
the cosmetics company Avon Products Inc.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bass
said the group had purchased a total of 2.5 million shares between
Oct. 3 and last Friday for prices ranging between $27.35 and $36.80
a share.
   The filing said the shares were purchased ``for investment
purposes,'' but it added the group may have discussions in the
future with Avon management ``concerning the issuers's recent
operating history as well as the issuer's general business outlook
and prospects.''
   The filing said the group also may ``engage in discussions with
other persons, including other shareholders'' of Avon.
   Last week, Avon sought to repel unwanted takeover advances from
an alliance of powerful investors including oil heir Gordon P.
Getty, a senior Mary Kay Corp. executive and the Fisher real estate
family of New York.
   A limited partnership called Chartwell Associates, revealing its
intentions after it became known Friday that the group had bought a
stake in Avon, said it may propose a merger with Avon or one of its
affiliates.
   In a summary of a document filed with the SEC, Chartwell
Associates LP disclosed that it owns 6.9 percent of Avon's common
stock and intends to purchase additional shares.
   Earlier this year Avon rejected outright takeover proposals from
the rival direct sales company Amway Corp. of Ada, Mich., and from
Minneapolis-based investor Irwin Jacobs.
   Avon also fended off takeover feelers from Mary Kay. Amway
offered $2.1 billion for Avon and Jacobs' offer was worth $2.85
billion.
   In addition to Bass, of Fort Worth, Texas, and the Robert M.
Bass Group Inc., the other purchasers of Avon shares listed in the
SEC filing were:
   Texas Partners Ltd.; John H. Scully and William E. Oberndorf,
both of Mill Valley. Calif.;TexGenPar, a Texas limited partnership;
The Bonderman Family Limited Partnership, a Texas securities
limited partnership; David Bonderman, of Fort Worth, Texas; San
Francisco Partners II, a California securities limited partnership;
and William J. Patterson.

   London share prices ended slightly higher Tuesday
as stocks rebounded despite bearish signals from the futures market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 2
points, or 0.09 percent, higher at 2,185.1 points, its session
high. The index's low was 2,171.0 points.
   Volume came to 350.6 million shares, compared with 364.9 million
shares on Monday.
   The rise was achieved despite downward signals from the FT-SE
100 futures contract, which closed at a 14-point discount to the
underlying market. Normally, the futures contract shows a
3-to-5-point premium.
   The market started lower as the pound came under pressure on the
foreign exchange market.
   But the stronger pound in the afternoon, combined with a healthy
opening on Wall Street, helped the London market move into positive
territory.

   May Department Stores Co. said Tuesday it had
agreed to purchase more than 14 million shares of its common stock
from May Centers Associates for $663 million.
   May spokesman Jim Abrams said the agreement also calls for the
purchase by May Centers and leaseback to May of department store
properties owned by May and valued at $585 million.
   Abrams said the transactions are expected to close in January,
subject to approval by the boards of directors of May and each of
the corporate partners of May Centers, Prudential Insurance Co. of
America and Melvin Simon &amp; Associates (PruSimon). May and PruSimon
equally own May Centers.
   May Centers was formed in August 1988 as a real estate-oriented
shopping center development partnership. PruSimon contributed cash
to the partnership and May contributed the stock it has now agreed
to repurchase.
   ``The net effect of the transaction is to raise earnings per
share of May shareholders and put a real estate investment more
appropriately in the partnership,'' said Abrams.

   The U.S. dollar fell Tuesday to eight-month lows
against other major currencies in moderate European trading.
   Gold surged above $400 an ounce in London for the first time in
10 months.
   Dealers said the West German mark rose against all currencies
amid speculation by non-German investors that the opening of East
Germany's borders would boost economic growth in West Germany and
possibly force the Bundesbank to raise interest rates.
   But West German traders and economists said they doubted the
West German central bank would act soon on interest rates.
   Dealers said the dollar suffered from recent declines in U.S.
interest rates, dropping to its lowest level since late February
against the West German, French, Dutch and Italian currencies.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.24 Japanese yen to a closing 144.43
yen. Later, in London, it fell further to 143.95 yen.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Monday's prices,
included: 1.8200 West German marks, down from 1.8360; 1.6200 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6315; 6.2000 French francs, down from 6.2465;
2.0537 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0760; 1,341.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,351.00; 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5645 from $1.5595 late
Monday.
   Bullion dealers said gold benefited from the dollar's fall and
from the turmoil in Eastern Europe.
   Gold jumped more than $6 in London to a late bid price of
$402.75 a troy ounce, compared with $396.50 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the metal jumped to $399 bid from $396.65 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.21 to close at a bid $398.61.
   Silver fell in London to a late bid price of $5.71 a troy ounce,
down from $5.74 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Gasoline and Food Costs Power Increase in Consumer Prices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent last month
as higher gasoline and food costs gave the country its biggest
inflation spurt since May, the government said today.
   The October increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index, which translated into an annual inflation rate of 5.9
percent, followed four months in which the index recorded modest
monthly gains of 0.2 percent or less.
   The price spurt was slightly worse than analysts had been
expecting. The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline
costs, higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit
and vegetable prices.
   Through the first 10 months of this year, consumer prices have
risen at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from the
4.4 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988.
   Many economists are predicting that the best news on inflation
has passed and that coming months will show higher inflationary
pressures. Still, few analysts are concerned that the price
increases will worsen beyond annual rates of around 5 percent.
   Underlying inflationary pressures had been masked during the
summer because of big declines in energy prices. With energy prices
now rebounding somewhat, analysts predicted that inflationary
pressures will be intensifying in coming months.
   ``Inflation pressures are persisting despite the slowdown in the
economy,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch.
``We had a long string of very moderate inflation reports but
inflation was never as good as those numbers indicated.''
   Wall Street took the latest inflation report in stride. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials rose by almost 6 points in early
trading.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
shrugged off last month's surge in consumer prices by noting that,
if the past six months were averaged, the CPI would show an annual
increase of just 3.3 percent.
   ``This is lower than that for any six-month period since
December 1986, and lower than the average inflation of 3.6 percent
over the last seven years. So inflation holds relatively steady but
at a low level,'' Fitzwater said.
   In a second report today, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings rose to $343.07 in October, 4 percent
higher than a year ago, but not enough to keep up with inflation
during this time period.
   Leading the October advance in the Consumer Price Index was a
0.9 percent seasonally adjusted jump in gasoline costs, the biggest
increase since a 3.9 percent surge in May. Gasoline prices have
been on a roller coaster this year, soaring by 21.2 percent in the
first five months of the year and then falling by 9.3 percent from
June through September.
   The price that consumers actually paid at the pump was unchanged
in October. However, gasoline prices normally fall in October, so
the frozen prices translated into an increase after the Labor
Department made its adjustments to take seasonal factors into
account.
   Food costs were up 0.4 percent in October, the biggest advance
since a 0.6 percent rise in May.
   Fruit and vegetable prices jumped 1.2 percent, reflecting higher
costs for apples and bananas. Dairy products posted a huge gain for
the second straight month, rising 1.8 percent for the biggest
advance since May 1980.
   New car prices were also up in October, rising by 0.6 percent
after having fallen for five consecutive months. The jump reflected
higher costs for the 1990 models and a big 1.3 percent rise in auto
financing costs. Used-car prices, however, continued to decline,
edging down 0.1 percent after a 0.7 percent drop in September.
   Other forms of energy also posted increases in October, with
heating-oil prices jumping by 2.5 percent and natural gas and
electricity costs rising by 0.3 percent.
   Consumer prices, after discounting food and energy, also rose by
0.5 percent. Many analysts consider this to be a better indication
of the underlying inflation rate because it removes the effects of
two of the most volatile categories.
   Clothing costs were up 1 percent in October, reflecting a second
month of rising costs with the introduction of new fall and winter
clothing lines.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer
Price Index stood at 125.6 in October, meaning that a hypothetical
selection of goods and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base
period would have cost $125.60 last month, up from $120.20 a year
ago.
   While October spurt in prices was slightly higher than many
economists had been expecting, they said it confrmed their view
that inflationary pressures are on the rise.
   ``Inflation is creeping upwards,'' said Frank McCormick, senior
economist at Bank of America in San Francisco. ``We see the
underlying rate of inflation going to around 5 percent a year.''
   As the year began, the Federal Reserve was fighting inflationary
pressures by pushing interest rates higher in an effort to dampen
economic demand. But since late May, the central bank has been
gradually lowering rates in response to fears that the
credit-tightening threatened to push the economy into a recession.
   McCormick predicted the central bank would cut interest rates
one more time, probably in December. But he said by May of next
year, the central bank will begin raising interest rates again and
would continue tightening through the rest of the year.
   But Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to the WEFA Group, an
economic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said he believed the
Fed was making a mistake by moving so cautiously in cutting
interest rates.
   He predicted inflation would stay in a moderate range with
annual increases under 4.5 percent, leaving the Fed with enough
room to do more to lower interest rates. He said such moves were
needed to keep the economy from stagnating.
   ``I don't see any risk of a major speed-up in inflation,''
Chimerine said. ``We are not getting the wage-price spiral that
people had expected.''
   The Labor Department reported earlier that wholesale prices rose
0.4 percent in October, leaving wholesale prices rising at an
annual rate of 5.2 percent through the first 10 months of the year.

<HEAD>Board Chairman of Restaurant Chain Retiring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Robert L. Barney, chairman of Wendy's
International Inc., is retiring from the hamburger restaurant chain
he helped build two decades ago, the company said Tuesday.
   Wendy's said it has no immediate plans to name a successor.
Barney's departure date is effective May 20, the company said.
   Barney had conditioned his retirement on the preparation of Jim
Near, who became president in 1986, to assume the chairmanship,
Wendy's spokesman Denny Lynch said. Near was named chief executive
officer earlier this year.
   Barney, 52, met Wendy's founder R. David Thomas when the two
worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Columbus in 1964.
   Thomas, who retains the title of senior chairman, will assume
Barney's duties until the retirement date.
   Barney helped Thomas begin the hamburger restaurant chain, and
served on its board of directors after the Nov. 15, 1969, founding
in downtown Columbus.
   Barney president in 1971, when Wendy's had two restaurants, and
helped develop the company's franchising system. He was named chief
executive officer in 1980 and chairman of the board in 1982.
   Wendy's, with nearly 3,800 restaurants and annual sales of $3
billion, celebrated its 20th anniversary ealier this month.
   ``Bob Barney is a great leader and an oustanding restaurant
operator,'' Thomas said in a statement. ``He's been a partner for
25 years and deserves much of the credit for building this company.
His leadership has been critical to our success.''
   The company generally is viewed as No.3 behind McDonald's and
Burger King, but has suffered losses in recent years that, by some
accounts, have placed it fourth behind Hardee's Food Systems Inc.
   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Howard Hansen saod Wendy's market
share is about 4.8 percent, compared to 5.5 percent for Hardee's.
   Wendy's average per-store sales rose 2.4 percent to $759,000 in
1988, ending a three-year decline. Hardee's reported per-store
average sales of $920,000 at its 3,200 units last year.

   The stock market was lower in afternoon trading
today, weighed down by new worries about inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.97 points at
2,626.07 at 2 pm EST, after being up slightly for most of the
trading session.
   Declining issues edged out advances by around 9-to-5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 885 issues down, 504 up and 538 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 105.25 million shares.
   Analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market
took a closer look at a government report today on inflation that
was slightly worse than most analysts had been expecting.
   The Labor Department reported that consumer prices shot up 0.5
percent last month as higher gasoline and food costs gave the
country its biggest inflation surge since May.
   ``That obviously didn't help'' stock prices, said Bill Raftery,
an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline costs,
higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and
vegetable prices.
   Much of today's selling focused on stocks of companies involved
in takeover attempts, analysts said.
   The market appeared to be shaky after Monday's 20.62-point drop
in the Dow average, caused by a selling wave that hit defense
contractors especially hard.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks had
fallen 0.72 to 187.31.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
0.80 at 370.68.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris had lost

   Georgia Gulf had dropped 7[ to 45\. The chemical manufacturer
announced that it has decided against a merger with NL Industries,

a $1.1 billion takeover offer.

<HEAD>Attorneys Close Case Against Former Merc Chairman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government lawyers said Tuesday that former
Chicago Mercantile Exchange Chairman Brian Monieson knew that two
of his employees were bilking customers of thousands of dollars.
   But the statements contrasted with testimony by others,
including Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, who said
Monieson enjoyed an unblemished reputation in the futures industry.
   Attorneys for the Commodity Futures Trading Comission, which
regulates the nation's commodity markets, said Monieson was aware
that two of his employees _ Ira P. Greenspon and Norman K. Furlett
_ at GNP Commodities Inc. of Chicago were cheating customers.
   Greenspon and Furlett, both now of Malibu, Calif., deny any
wrongdoing, as does Monieson, of Northbrook, Ill.
   The testimony came at a hearing before an administrative law
judge on a complaint against three men brought by the CFTC. If
found guilty, Monieson, Furlett and Greenspon could be permanently
barred from trading.
   ``What did he (Monieson) do? Sent Norm Furlett and Ira Greenspon
back to handle more orders,'' government attorney Patricia Donahue
said.
   Monieson's lawyer, Jerrold Salzman, acknowledged that traders
``may have injured customers,'' but said his client had no role and
did not supervise Furlett or Greenspon.
   ``The question is whether he failed to act in good faith,''
Salzman said. ``Mr. Monieson's conduct was appropriate.''
   ``He is chairman of the board, he is not the chief executive
officer. He has a right to rely'' on others to keep an eye on daily
operations, the attorney said.
   The government maintains Furlett and Greenspon engaged in
``allocated trades'' that defrauded customers. The term refers to
initiating futures contracts without the required customer account
numbers, then keeping profitable trades for themselves while
sticking customers with the losses.
   The government is not accusing Monieson of committing the
trades, but it claims he was told several times between June 1985
and May 1986 that Furlett and Greenspon were making bad deals.
   Futures are contracts to buy or sell commodities ranging from
orange juice to stocks at a specified price on a future date. The
contracts are traded either to lock in commodity prices in advance,
thereby reducing their financial risk, or to speculate on price
changes.
   Yeutter, who was president of the Merc when Monieson was Merc
chairman from 1983-85, was one of several character witnesses
called before Administrative Law Judge George Painter.
   ``Brian Monieson had an undisputed reputation as a man of
honesty and integrity,'' he said.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, said:
``I have no doubt about his integrity or his honesty. His general
reputation is very good.''
   Painter is to issue a ruling early next year after attorneys for
both sides submit final written statements.
   Melamed's decision to testify and Salzman's to defend Monieson
prompted former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri to resign from
the Merc's board of governors. Eagleton said Merc officials should
stay away from Monieson, not help bail him out. Salzman is the
Merc's outside counsel.

<HEAD>Pan Am To Expand Commuter Service in Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan American World Airways said Tuesday it will
increase commuter service in Florida using a fleet of 40 new
turboprop aircraft leased from British Aerospace.
   Pan Am said the expansion out of Miami International Airport
initially will serve five cities and increase to 10 next fall.
   The move is the latest by a major carrier to offer in-state
travelers better prices and more options and is expected to
intensify competition in Florida.
   American Airlines initiated its American Eagle commuter service
in October and plans to serve eight cities by year's end.
   Continental-Eastern Express flies to 10 cities from Miami with
eight planes. On Dec. 15, the service will drop Continental from
its name and plans to add six planes and 25 flights in February,
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said.
   ``It will be a buyer's market,'' said Jack Guiteras, president
of Lorraine Travel.
   Guiteras said he expected the increased competition to lead to
lower fares since travelers to smaller Florida locales will have
wider choices of airlines, flight times and fares.
   Candace Browning, an airline analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp;
Co. in New York, said: ``Pan Am is taking a long-term perspective
toward building their market share.''
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said the first of the new
aircraft is scheduled for delivery next spring and will be put into
service by Pan Am Express in intra-Florida markets to feed Pan
American World Airways growing hub operation out of Miami.
   The service is to include 25 daily round-trip flights, all
operated into Miami; five daily round trips from Key West; six from
Sarasota; six from Fort Myers; five from West Palm Beach; and three
from Melbourne.
   The flights will connect with Pan American World Airways' Miami
departures, which by Dec. 15 will total 66 daily, including 42
flights to other U.S. cities and 24 to international destinations
in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.
   The additional 25 Pan Am Express departures would increase the
daily operations of the two Pan Am Corp. subsidiaries to 91.
   ``With the growing popularity of Florida as a destination for
Europeans and North and South Americans alike, we are confident
that the demand for increased capacity provides an advantageous
time for Pan Am Express to enter Florida,'' Plaskett said.
   Pan Am Express, purchased by Pan Am Corp. in 1987, currently
serves 11 cities in the northeastern United States, Los Angeles and
San Diego, as well as 11 European cities.
   Its fleet includes 12 50-passenger deHavilland Dash 7 aircraft
and 10 44-passenger ATR 42s. Another 13 aircraft already were on
order.
   In addition to the 19-seat Jetstream 31 aircraft, the Pan Am
Express order from British Aerospace includes 29-seat Jetstream 41s.
   Pan Am will get 10 Jetstream 31s to be delivered in 1990 and 10
Jetstream 41s, a new stretch version of the 31, to be delivered in
1993. Also, Pan Am has options on an additional 10 of each type of
aircraft.

   Energy futures prices ended lower in fairly thin
trading Tuesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude,
declined 3 cents to $19.96 a barrel, after rising 16 cents in the
previous session. The February contract slipped 5 cents to $19.78
and March crude lost 7 cents to $19.58.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline for December delivery fell 0.26 cent to 51.96
cents a gallon and January lost 0.22 cent to 52.76 cents a gallon.
   No. 2 heating oil for December dipped 0.14 cent to 59.94 a
gallon and the January contract dropped 0.30 cent to 59.58 cents a
gallon.
   Analysts said trading volume was relatively light ahead of the
coming Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday.
   Overall, the market is holding relatively steady in anticipation
of the weekend meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, energy analysts said.
   ``The sense of the market is that there is a lack of news to go
on,'' said John H. O'Connell, analyst with Refco Inc. ``The market
is going to wait.''
   ``People are not looking for major events to come out of the
OPEC meeting given the narrow trading this week,'' said Bob Baker,
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   OPEC is expected to address the thorny issue of quota
reallocation as some of the 13 member nations press for higher
shares of the production pie. The ministers are scheduled to begin
meeting Saturday in Vienna, Austria.

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of United Auto Workers
union members chanting ``Lee lies'' paraded outside Chrysler Corp.
headquarters Tuesday to protest the closing of a car assembly plant.
   Chrysler earlier this month announced it would halt production
of Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars at its Jefferson
Avenue plant in early February and lay off about 1,700 workers.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca on Monday said further plant
closings may occur because of weak sales.
   ``This gives Lee Iacocca a black eye with his credibility,''
said Don Petty, chief steward of UAW Local 1264 at a Chrysler plant
in Sterling Heights.
   About 500 protesters marched behind a banner reading ``Iacocca
lied again.'' Among other signs was one picturing Iacocca as a
chicken smoking a cigar above a caption reading, ``Mr. No Show in
Louisville.''
   Iacocca has declined to attend the UAW's meeting next week in
Kentucky, the first time since 1986 he won't appear. Two Chrysler
executives are scheduled to replace Iacocca.
   The rally also gave indications that national contract
negotiations, which open next summer, could be acrimonious. UAW
contracts with Chrysler, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
expire on Sept. 14, 1990.
   ``This is not just a rally for the Jefferson closing,'' said
Aaron Taylor, president of UAW Local 7 at the Jefferson Avenue
plant.
   Workers from Syracuse, N.Y., and Chrysler's Acustar plant in
Huntsville, Ala., joined Detroit-area workers at the march.
   ``It's a scary feeling,'' said Nancy Adams, who was laid off a
few weeks ago from Chrysler's transmission plant in Syracuse and
remains a member of Local 624.
   The company said the Jefferson Avenue plant closing is permitted
under its contract, which allows for shutdowns due to slow sales.
Omni and Horizon sales have been slumping.
   But union officials have said the move violates local and
national contracts and they are angry they were not notified about
the action before it appeared in the media.
   UAW Vice President Stan Marshall, head of the union's Chrysler
Department, said relations between the union and Chrysler are
strained because of the plant closing and Iacocca's statement in
Washington Monday that others could follow.
   UAW Region 1 Director Bob Lent said the conflict could continue
into contract negotiations.
   Said Marshall: ``I think that they are the ones trying to set
the atmosphere by Lee going out there and making all kinds of
statements, (like) well, we might have to close other assembly
plants and everything.''

   Possibly wide-ranging cuts in military spending
could hurt some programs of the nation's two largest defense
contractors, but McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.
indicated Tuesday they did not feel immediately threatened.
   Diversification into areas such as the booming commercial
aircraft market, plus expectations of a continuing need for some
major weapons systems, could soften the impact on both the
companies and local economies of any cuts.
   Defense company stocks fell broadly Monday on word that Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney was considering suggestions for $180
billion in spending cuts over the next several years, due to budget
concerns and reduced tensions in Eastern Europe.
   Possible proposals include cutting the Army by 100,000 soldiers,
getting rid of 100 Navy ships and closing at least a dozen Air
Force bases.
   St. Louis-based General Dynamics, down $4.87{ a share on Monday,
fell another $1 to $43.12{ on Tuesday. McDonnell Douglas, down
$1.12{ Monday, fell another 62{ cents to $67.62{ a share.
   At McDonnell Douglas Corp., the St. Louis area's biggest
employer, the cutbacks could hurt the F-15 Eagle and the FA-18
Hornet fighter jet programs. The company also makes the
AV8B-Harrier, the Harpoon missile and the Tomahawk cruise missile.
   But without specific cuts outlined, it was too early to
speculate on the impact on McDonnell Douglas, spokesman Jim Reed
said.
   General Dynamics is the nation's second-largest defense
contractor. While McDonnell Douglas has a commercial aircraft
program, General Dynamics is defense-oriented and could be more
vulnerable to cuts.
   But General Dynamics spokesman Pete Connolly said the company
didn't feel threatened because it had concentrated on making basic
military equipment.
   ``This has been something that we've anticipated, so we've put
our bets down on the programs that we think we can do best,''
Connolly said. ``The bottom line is we think our strategy has given
us a very strong foothold for the 90s.''
   Connolly said the company's F-16 fighter jets, M-1 tanks and
Trident and Seawolf submarines were ``the programs that we think
are going to be around.''
   ``Sure, there will be some cutbacks, but we don't see that any
of our programs are going to be on the cancellation list. There's
always going to be a defense requirement in this country _ that's
never going to go away,'' he said.
   Any impact on the contractors could be repeated in a number of
other regions with big defense industries, although several experts
said St. Louis would feel little economic strain if eventual cuts
were along the lines of those mentioned by Cheney.
   ``Sure, McDonnell Douglas is the largest single employer, but
manufacturing has become a slow second to service areas in general
in the metropolitan area,'' said Murray Weidenbaum, of the Center
for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St.
Louis.
   Weidenbaum also said the defense industry was accustomed to
cycles, although some past attempts at diversification _ such as
Grumman Corp.'s one-time production of powered wheelbarrows _ have
not done well.
   ``I don't know what they're going to do, but it isn't easy to
turn a large aerospace company around quickly, because they're
geared to producing items that are so different from a civilian
item.''
   McDonnell Douglas President Gerald Johnston recently
acknowledged that the defense industry was likely to have difficult
adjustments in the coming years.
   ``But I believe our industry is uniquely capable of shifting
from military to civil production if called upon to do so,'' he
said in a recent speech.
   Julie Niemann, an analyst from Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. Inc., said
McDonnell Douglas already was relying more heavily on its
commercial aircraft business.
   ``They're smart people out there. They knew the defense cuts
were coming,'' Niemann said.
   McDonnell Douglas' commercial aircraft operation, Douglas
Aircraft in Long Beach, Calif., is booming and accounts for about
30 percent of the company's overall business, McDonnell Douglas
officials said.

<HEAD>Gold Tops $400, Hits 10-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices topped $400 an ounce Tuesday for the first time in
nearly 10 months in a steady rise that quieted doubts about the
market's underlying strength. Other precious metals also rose.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures retreated; livestock
and meat futures were mostly higher; and grains and soybeans were
mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.10 to $6 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at $404.40 a
troy ounce. The less heavily traded contract for November delivery
finished at $403.70.
   Gold futures last closed above $400 on Jan. 26.
   Silver settled 14.2 cents to 14.6 cents higher with November at
$5.834 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said they were impressed that the gold market neither
balked at the $400 level nor surged wildly after crossing it but
continued to exhibit the same quiet strength that has characterized
the market's resurgence during the past five weeks.
   ``It's been coming up gradually,'' said analyst Sharon Ziemian
of Citibank in New York.
   ``You haven't seen jumps of $20 at a pop, and those kinds of big
pops are things that tend to set the market back fairly quickly,
too,'' she said, referring to the selloffs that typically follow
sudden, sharp gains.
   Indeed, few recent buyers have taken profits in the 5{ weeks
since the gold market began rising from the $365-an-ounce area at
which it had traded for much of 1989.
   ``The holders of the metal believe its going to go higher and
that is the sign of a true bull market,'' said Don Mackay-Coghill,
chief executive officer of GoldCorp Australia, a state-owned
corporation established to market Australian precious metals.
   Mackay-Coghill, who is touring the United States to promote his
company's gold and platinum investment coins, said he was
``delighted'' with GoldCorp's sales volume.
   Investors seeking safety from the volatile stock market continue
to lead the gold rally, analysts said.
   Tuesday's government report that consumer prices rose 0.5
percent last month may have spurred the rise of the
inflation-sensitive gold market, they said. The report added one
more note of uncertainty to an already clouded economic outlook.
   ``I don't think people are looking to gold to make big gains,''
said Ms. Ziemian. ``I think people are looking to gold as a safe
haven.''
   Energy futures prices ended lower in fairly thin trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 24 cents
lower with January at $19.96 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent to
.37 cent lower with December at 59.94 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .26 cent lower to .15 cent higher with December at
51.96 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures rose moderately on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, buoyed by expectations for higher cash
livestock prices Wednesday as packers gather inventory before
Thanksgiving interrupts the normal slaughter schedule.
   Live cattle settled .40 cent to .50 cent higher with December at
75.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .53 cent
higher with November at 83.22 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.50 cent higher with December at 49.97 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .02 cent to .35 cent higher with February at 63.05
cents a pound.
   Wheat futures slipped on the Chicago Board of Trade while corn
and soybean futures ended mostly higher.
   The wheat market opened lower and remained weak throughout the
session amid selling linked to a lack of significant new export
demand.
   The corn market was buoyed by the USDA's report late Monday of
an unexpectedly large amount of corn inspected for export last week.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with December at
$4.09\ a bushel; corn futures were { cent lower to } cent higher
with December at $2.38 a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent
higher with December at $1.45{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 2
cents higher with January at $5.85} a bushel.

   The stock market was mixed Tuesday, weighed down
by the latest bout of inflation worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.25 points to
2,639.29.
   The broader market was lower, however. Declining issues
outnumbered advancing ones by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 860 down, 622 up and
522 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 147.90 million
shares, up from 128.17 million in Monday's session.
   ``People are pulling their horns in a little bit,'' said Ralph
Acampora, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``There's a little
apprehension, a little uncertainty.''
   Analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market
took a closer look at a government report on inflation that was
slightly worse than most experts had been expecting.
   The Labor Department reported that consumer prices shot up 0.5
percent last month as higher gasoline and food costs gave the
country its biggest inflation surge since May.
   ``That obviously didn't help'' stock prices, said Bill Raftery,
an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The government blamed the rise on a jump in gasoline costs,
higher prices for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and
vegetable prices.
   Much of Tuesday's selling focused on stocks of companies
involved in takeover attempts, analysts said.
   Georgia Gulf, for example, dropped 6[ to 46\. The chemical
manufacturer announced that it has decided against a merger with NL
Industries, the company controlled by billionaire Harold Simmons
that had made a $1.1 billion takeover offer.
   Later, Lockheed said it received notice from Simmons that he
intends to acquire 15 percent or more of its common stock. Lockheed
jumped 1[ to 37.
   The market appeared to be shaky after Monday's 20.62-point drop
in the Dow average, caused by a selling wave that hit defense
contractors especially hard.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney called on Sunday for a $180
billion reduction in military spending over the next six years.
   On Tuesday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed
Cheney's statements but said President Bush hasn't decided yet what
defense expenditures he will propose to Congress for the next
fiscal year.
   Among other actively traded issues on the NYSE, Holiday fell 1\
point to 70, General Motors `E' stock was down | at 54}, Philip
Morris declined { to 40} and Bristol Myers-Squibb was unchanged at
54}.
   Texas Instruments jumped 2\ to 31}, McDonalds was up 1 at 32]
and IBM rose } to 99{.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 174.56 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $907 million, or 0.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up 0.02 to 188.05.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index advanced 0.38 to 387.57, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.24 to 339.59.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell

   Gold prices soared past $400 an ounce Tuesday,
crossing that psychologically important barrier for the first time
since late January.
   Meanwhile, the dollar fell sharply amid speculation that
interest rates might rise in West Germany.
   Gold prices have been inching upward in recent weeks, but when
they crossed the $400 a troy ounce level Tuesday, buyers
enthusiastically began to snap up the metal.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold
surged $5.50 to $403.70, while Republic National Bank quoted a late
bid of $403.50 for a troy ounce, also up $5.50 from late Monday.
   ``Gold and silver all of a sudden are back in favor,'' said
Steven Pepper, a precious metals analyst with Republic.
   Silver picked up 14.6 cents to close at $5.834 a troy ounce on
the Commodity Exchange, although it fell earlier in London to a
late bid price of $5.71 a troy ounce from late Monday's $5.74.
   In earlier overseas trading, dealers said gold benefited from
the dollar's fall and from the turmoil in Eastern Europe.
   Gold jumped more than $6 in London to a late bid price of
$402.75 a troy ounce, compared with $396.50 bid late Monday, and in
Zurich, the metal rose to a bid of $399 from late Monday's $396.65.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.21 to close at a bid $398.61 a troy
ounce.
   The dollar slumped as speculation grew that West Germany's
central bank, the Bundesbank, would be forced to raise interest
rates because the influx of East Germans into the country might
boost economic growth.
   When foreign interest rates rise and U.S. rates do not keep
pace, the dollar becomes less attractive to overseas investors.
Speculation that interest rates might go up abroad often sparks
selling of the U.S. currency.
   Overseas, the dollar reached its lowest level since late
February against the West German, French, Dutch and Italian
currencies. In New York, its tone was stronger because the domestic
market was reluctant to turn bearish on the U.S. currency, said
Linda McLaughlin, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets
Group.
   However, the dollar still suffered sharp losses on domestic
markets. Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.81375 West German marks, down from 1.8338;
1.6130 Swiss francs, down from 1.62975; 6.1775 French francs, down
from 6.2435; 1,336.00 Italian lire, down from 1,350.00; and 1.16995
Canadian dollars, down from 1.17105.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.8200 West German marks, down from 1.8360;
1.6200 Swiss francs, down from 1.6315; 6.2000 French francs, down
from 6.2465; 2.0537 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0760; 1,341.00
Italian lire, down from 1,351.00; 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1712.
   The dollar also fell against the British pound. One pound cost
$1.56975 in New York, compared with $1.5582 late Monday. In London
earlier, the pound rose to $1.5645 from $1.5595 late Monday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.24 Japanese yen to a closing 144.43
yen. Later, in London, it fell further to 143.95 yen, and in New
York, it declined to 143.555 yen, down from 144.355 late Monday.

<HEAD>Boeing, Machinists Making Plans To Get Back To Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. managers huddled Tuesday on how to
resume full operations, while Machinists members picked up a final
strike paycheck and prepared to resume work Wednesday following the
end of their 48-day strike.
   A spokesman for Boeing _ which already had an order backlog of
1,700 jetliners before the strike _ said the company may not be
able to resume full production until after the first of the year.
   Workers seemed mixed in their opinion of the three-year contract
ratified with 81.4 percent approval late Monday night, but most
said they were relieved to see an end to the second-longest strike
in Boeing's history.
   ``I think it's fair, but for the amount of days we were out we
could have done better,'' said Carl Olson, a jig builder at Boeing
Advanced Systems.
   ``I'm glad to get back to work but I voted against the
contract,'' said machinist Richard Duncalf. He said the union had
struck to get higher wage increases, but failed to get improvements
in that area over a contract rejected Oct. 3, the day before
machinists walked out.
   The offer ratified late Monday provides wage increases totaling
10 percent over three years, plus annual bonuses totaling 10
percent of gross pay over the first year, 5 percent the second and
4 percent the third.
   On Wednesday, most workers will receive a $500 advance on their
bonus.
   A cost-of-living adjustment formula will account for virtually
all of inflation. Workers will receive a 60-cent-per-hour
cost-of-living increase immediately and a 45 cents an hour base pay
increase to ake up for a 1986 adjustment that workers didn't get.
   The contract also reduces mandatory overtime to two consecutive
weekends and 144 hours per quarter with double-time pay after 160
hours. In the old contract, workers could be required to work 200
hours a quarter and four weekends in a row, a key consideration in
attempting to deal with Boeing's order backlog.
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Ronda Jones, a nine-year Boeing
worker. ``It's hardly any better than the contract first offered.''
   But she said that with the holidays approaching, people wanted
to be back at work.
   Boeing had record profits in its most recent quarter and has a
backlog of more than 1,700 planes worth about $85 billion, with
deliveries for those jets stretching past the year 2000. The
Machinists had received bonuses but no wage increases in the past
six years.
   Production was severely curtailed during the strike, athough
supervisors and non-striking personnel delivered 24 planes, many of
which had been virtually completed before the walkout began.
   Jack Gamble, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said
managers and supervisors spent Tuesday planning ways to smooth the
strikers' return.
   On Wednesday, most of the day will be spent in crew meetings and
other discussions of what work needs to be done on different
projects, Gamble said. The work also has to be secured before the
start of the four-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
   Gamble said there are only four weeks after Thanksgiving before
the contract-mandated holiday period of Dec. 25 through Jan. 1, and
it was questionable whether production could be back at full speed
by then.
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751 here, said
it may take time for the membership to get over bitterness from the
strike. Many workers ``always thought the company would take care
of them,'' Baker said Monday night. ``They found that was not the
case.''
   ``I don't think you're going to find many ill feelings,'' Gamble
said, adding that one reason for the crew meetings is to get any
such feelings out in the open.
   ``I think from what I've seen, people are all ready, eager and
willing to get back at work,'' he said.
   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, ended after 45 days. Its
longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948.

   Backers of sweeping changes in the way
Medicare reimburses physicians said Tuesday the plan, if it becomes
law, will change the way medicine is practiced in the United States.
   The compromise plan, worked out by House and Senate negotiators
Monday as part of the budget reconciliation bill, would have no
immediately discernible impact on the 33 million elderly and
disabled Americans who receive Medicare.
   Over the longer term, however, supporters say the plan would
improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to medical services and
would help stabilize the costs of the program, which have been
climbing more than 15 percent a year and are expected to reach $44
billion this year.
   Congress was working toward final passage of the overall bill
Tuesday.
   ``It's the beginning of a fundamental change in physician
behavior patterns,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., an
architect of the plan.
   ``Within the next three or four years, there is really going to
be significant change ... in terms of procedures, volume of
procedures, which is what drive up the cost of Medicare,'' he said.
   The result, Rockefeller said, would be a greater emphasis on
less expensive primary care, including preventive care.
   Although the changes would begin with the Medicare program,
Rockefeller said private insurance companies, which also are trying
to rein in the costs of medical care, likely would implement the
changes eventually because ``medicine follows Medicare'' in the
United States.
   The American Medical Association supports the plan as a
cost-stabilizing measure. John Zapp, the association's director of
government relations, said beneficiaries probably wouldn't notice a
difference in care.
   Opponents, however, say the plan would lead to rationing of
health care and a decline in the quality of services. Edmund
Haislmaier, a health-care policy analyst at the conservative
Heritage Foundation, said that the plan may initially level out
costs but that it does not contain the incentives necessary to
control expenditures over the long term.
   Over time, it could lead to rationing of medical services, he
said, adding, ``It's not going to happen tomorrow, but you're
setting the stage for it.''
   The plan, to be phased in over five years beginning in 1992,
includes a new payment schedule for reimbursing physicians who
treat Medicare patients. Now, reimbursements are based on a
doctor's customary charges, which can have little relationship to
cost and can vary from region to region.
   The new rates would boost fees for family and general-practice
physicians and internists. Fees would be lowered for surgeons,
radiologists and other specialties that are procedure-based.
   The fees would be standardized by specialty, with geographic
adjustments designed to account for regional differences in costs.
   The American Society of Internal Medicine, the leading
professional organization for internists, backs the plan, saying
the fee schedule ``will neutralize incentives for physicians to
practice a very high-tech oriented style of medicine,'' helping to
moderate future increases in Medicare costs.
   A spokeswoman for the American College of Surgeons declined to
comment in detail until its officials read the final language of
the measure, but she said that ``right now, we're very favorable.''
   ``This group realizes the world is different and there's a
certain reality out there,'' said spokeswoman Linn Meyer. ``There's
a lot of concern with the costs of medicine ... (and) there has to
be belt tightening. All health-care sectors are going to be
affected.''
   Another part of the plan attempts to slow the increase in
payments to physicians and to control the volume of services they
provide by linking increases in physician payments to a Medicare
spending goal. If physician payments exceed the goal, reimbursement
rates could be cut.
   The plan also requires physicians to submit claims for
beneficiaries. Some now require the patient to pay the bill and
seek reimbursement from Medicare.
   Also, the plan continues but simplifies limits on how much
physicians can charge Medicare patients over the amount they will
be reimbursed by the program.

   Georgia Gulf Corp. said Tuesday it was
considering a debt-financed recapitalization, a defensive move
against NL Industries Inc.'s recent unsolicited $1.1 billion bid to
buy the chemical manufacturer.
   Georgia Gulf said in a vaguely worded statement it had decided a
recapitalization was the best way for the company to benefit its
stockholders.
   The company did not disclose any details of its plans. It said a
special shareholders meeting would be called once arrangements were
made.
   Georgia Gulf said it had considered other alternatives to NL's
$50 a share bid, which was announced Oct. 31 and has since expired.
Georgia Gulf said it had discussed the possibility of a business
combination with or acquisition of the chemical maker by third
parties who had expressed interest in the firm.
   ``A leveraged recapitalization, among the various transactions
under consideration, would be the most favorable to the company's
stockholders,'' Georgia Gulf said.
   Under a leveraged recapitalization, a company usually borrows a
significant amount of money and uses it to pay shareholders a
dividend or expand the business.
   Houston-based NL, which owns about 9.9 percent of Georgia Gulf's
25.6 million outstanding shares, offered last month to buy the rest
of the company for $1.1 billion. During the summer, Texas
billionaire Harold Simmons, who controls NL, said his holdings in
Georgia Gulf were no longer for the sole purpose of investment.
   NL said in a statement Tuesday it was willing to reinstate its
offer, and also said it would support the proposed recapitalization
if the deal would pay stockholders a higher amount than Simmons'
$50 a share bid.
   NL said it was leaving its options open, and would consider
either adding to or reducing its Georgia Gulf stake depending on
future events.
   John Garcia, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New
York, said the proposed recapitalization could result in the price
of Georgia Gulf's stock increasing to about $55 a share.
   But in the absence of any details about the recapitalization,
Georgia Gulf shares skidded in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The company's stock fell $6.12{ to $46.25 a share.
   Raising the stock price, and the value of his holdings, by
forcing a recapitalization may have been what Simmons wanted all
along, Garcia said.
   ``I think a recap at $55 ends the (takeover) story,'' said
Garcia, who previously characterized Simmons' bid as an attempt to
drive the stock price up. ``A recapitalization was the most likely
outcome in the first place.''
   Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York,
said Georgia Gulf's announcement was obviously a defensive step,
but he said it was too soon to say if the strategy would take NL
out of the picture. He noted that ``nothing has been disclosed''
about the terms of the recapitalization.
   Garcia said Georgia Gulf probably decided against a merger
because of antitrust considerations.
   Georgia Gulf was created in 1985 when Georgia-Pacific Corp.
divested itself of its commodity chemicals business. With 1988
sales of $1.06 billion, the company manufactures a variety of
chemicals and polymers, including aromatic, natural gas and
electrochemical products, as well as thermoplastic and
thermosetting resins.

<HEAD>Mediation Board Again Orders Teamsters Election at USAir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency on Tuesday ordered an
election to determine whether an estimated 8,000 USAir fleet
service workers will be represented by the Teamsters union, the
third such election in eight years.
   The Federal Mediation Board said the new election was necessary
because many of the fleet service workers, who handle USAir's
baggage, catering and field operations, were non-union workers with
Piedmont Airlines prior to the August merger of the two carriers.
   ``It's disgraceful we have to go through this election again,''
William Genoese, the head of the Teamsters Airline division, said
in a statement. ``But we've beaten this company twice and we can do
it again.''
   Attempts to reach USAir for comment Tuesday were unsuccessful;
word of the decision was received after the airline's Virginia
headquarters had closed for the day.
   The Teamsters said the addition of the former Piedmont workers
would make it the largest union election in the private sector in
four years.
   The Teamsters won an election among the fleet service agents in
1981 but a new vote was ordered last year because of of USAir's
subsequent purchases of several smaller carriers. The Teamsters
again prevailed.
   In ordering the new election, the Mediation Board rejected
arguments by the Teamsters that since Piedmont'a work force was
smaller than the number of USAir workers already represented by the
Teamsters the new workers should have automatically fallen under
the union's jurisdiction.
   Genoese contended USAir sought the election because it hopes to
decertify the union and then contract out the work.
   Three other unions representing USAir workers, the Air Line
Pilots Association, the Association of Flight Attendants and the
International Association of Machinists gained representation
rights of the former Piedmont workers without elections.
   Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C., are the two cities with the
largest number of affected workers, about 1,100 in each city, both
of which are major USAir hubs. In all, approximately 8,000 workers
at 147 airports in virtually every state are eligible to vote in
the election.
   Ballots will be mailed out within 45 days and workers have 30
days to return them. Only those workers in favor of union
representation have to return the ballots; those not returned are
counted as ``no'' votes.
   The union must get votes from 50 percent a the work force,
approximately 4,000, to win the election.

   Charles H. Keating Jr., the central figure in
an influence peddling investigation involving the nation's biggest
savings and loan failure, refused to testify before a House
committee Tuesday.
   Keating, who serves as chairman of the parent company of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., cited his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   ``On the advice of counsel, I respectfully exercise my
constitutional prerogative and privilege and refuse to answer
questions here today,'' the Phoenix millionaire told the House
Banking Committee.
   Keatin also rebuffed reporters' shouted questions in entering
and leaving the committee room. But the parent company, American
Continental Corp., released a statement in which he challenged
Congress to do a better job in its investigation and added that he
had doubts it ``is really up to the task.''
   Earlier Tuesday, the nation's top thrift regulator said elected
politicians to whom Keating contributed millions of dollars since
buying Lincoln in 1984 had no influence on his decision in 1987
against immediately seizing the savings and loan.
   ``No political figure influenced my decision,'' said M. Danny
Wall, director of the new Office of Thrift Regulation and chairman
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board that preceded it as the
industry's regulator. ``I don't know how I can say that more
emphatically.''
   The Senate ethics committee last week hired an outside counsel
to investigate allegations that five senators who received $1.3
million in political gifts from Keating improperly intervened with
regulators on Lincoln's behalf.
   All five _ Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz; John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and John
Glenn, D-Ohio _ have denied violating any laws or ethics rules of
the Senate.
   At Tuesday's hearing, Keating invoked a House rule allowing him
to bar broadcasting of his remarks by television and radio and to
forbid still photographers from taking pictures.
   However, the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, allowed coverage of him swearing in Keating as a witness.
   Keating also asked the committee to invoke another rule that
would have allowed it to hear what he had to say in a closed
executive session but withdrew the request after several
congressmen raised questions about the procedure.
   After his appearance, American Continental Corp. issued a
release saying Keating invoked the Fifth Amendment ``most
reluctantly and stated that he is hopeful he can freely testify
before the committee in the near future.''
   Keating is the subject of a federal grand jury probe in Los
Angeles and has been sued by federal regulators in a $1.1 billion
fraud and racketeering suit.
   In the statement, Keating said Congress should ``provide more
than mere lip service to its investigation and ... ferret through
the real facts.''
   ``I am not sure Congress is really up to the task,'' he said.
   Wall told the committee he had made mistakes regarding the
Lincoln case from the time he assumed the bank board's chairmanship
in July 1987 until it was taken over by regulators last April.
   Government officials have put the cost to taxpayers of Lincoln's
failure at $2.33 billion _ a figure that Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,
said represents ``$50 for every family in this country.''
   ``Clearly, had we known then what we know now, we would have
acted differently,'' Wall said.
   California regulators and mid-level officials in Wall's agency
have testified in previous hearings that Keating's political
influence hampered their efforts to uncover and stop what Wall on
Tuesday called a ``heist'' of federally insured deposits in Lincoln.
   Wall said lawmakers had spoken with him on behalf of the S&amp;L and
its owner, Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. But he said
his decisions ``were devoid of any political influence,'' and he
added, ``I was not under the spell of Charles Keating.''
   Wall acknowledged receiving telephone calls from DeConcini,
Cranston and Rep. Carroll Hubbard Jr., D-Ky., about Keating's
efforts to sell Lincoln earlier this year before the government
seized it.
   ``But those calls were well within the limits of propriety,'' he
said. ``Their inquiries were for a status report or to urge action,
but in no way were they attempts to tell me what action to take.''
   Hubbard, the fourth-ranking Democrat on the House panel,
vigorously defended his action at the opening of the hearing,
saying he called Wall only at the request of former Rep. John
Rousselot, R-Calif., who was then trying to arrange a sale of
Lincoln.
   Gonzalez chastised Wall for rejecting a May 1987 recommendation
from field examiners in the Bank Board's San Francisco office to
seize Lincoln then.
   San Francisco ``sounded an eight-alarm warning ... (but) for 23
months and two weeks (Washington) failed to take definitive and
effective action,'' said Gonzalez, who has asked President Bush to
fire Wall.
   Gonzalez faulted Washington regulators for failing to ``sense
who they were dealing with in Charlie Keating,'' whom he accused of
using Lincoln like an automatic teller machine as a source for cash.
   Wall defended his rejection of the San Francisco examiners'
suggestion, saying they had ``found smoke but no fire.''
   But he admitted that, in hindsight, he erred in postponing a
scheduled field examination of Lincoln's offices in September 1987
after the thrift threatened to get a court order to bar entry.
   ``You can second-guess yourself to the point of distraction,''
he said. At the time ``we were on the brink of disaster in the
thrift industry'' and ``Lincoln was just barely on our scope.''
   In turn, Wall blamed the San Francisco staff for approving a
tax-sharing agreement drafted by Lincoln's parent company, American
Continental Corp., that he said allowed it to illegally ``drain $95
million'' from the thrift between April 1986 and July 1988.
   ``The heist was halted,'' he said, only after Ban Board
officials in Washington acted on a tip from California state
regulators and launched a new examination of their own, both into
Lincoln and its holding company.

<HEAD>Bank Plans $50 Million Charge for Previously Disclosed Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. said Tuesday it
plans to take a $50 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter in
connection with allegations of fraud reported earlier at its
Geneva, Switzerland, office.
   The banking company, which also previously disclosed it had
dismissed an officer at the branch as a result of the allegations,
said an investigation was continuing and that the bank is working
with Swiss authorities.
   It said the charge, which amounts to $35 million after taxes,
resulted from losses on foreign exchange trading for customer
accounts, interest to be paid on such accounts and embezzlement.
   The bank's Geneva office is principally engaged in asset
management for individuals.
   Last month, Swiss police arrested a former Manufacturers Hanover
investment banker in connection with an embezzlement that they said
amounted to $2.2 million from the bank's Geneva office.
   Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment at the time on the
amount of money embezzled, but said that losses like those incurred
at the Geneva office are normally covered by insurance and do not
affect earnings.
   The bank said Tuesday it would seek to minimize the loss through
recoveries and insurance.
   Manufacturers Hanover earned $224 million, or $4.28 a share, in
the fourth quarter of 1988. That was an exceptionally strong
performance, however, as the results included $146 million in
past-due interest payments on loans to Brazil.

   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.'s board of
directors on Tuesday recommended that its stockholders reject
Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s sweetened $3.6 billion takeover bid, saying
it was still too low and was illegal.
   Georgia-Pacific, which on Sunday increased its offer to $63 a
share from $58 a share, responded that it would continue its
pursuit of the paper products company.
   In a letter Sunday to Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig,
Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said the new offer
represented a 63 percent premium above Great Northern's share price
before Georgia-Pacific's original $3.1 billion offer was made Oct.
31.
   But Laidig, in a letter to shareholders Tuesday, said: ``The
modest increase in the price of Georgia-Pacific's offer, announced
on Nov. 19, has done nothing to change your board's determination
that the offer is not in the best interests of your company and its
shareowners.''
   Also, Laidig said his company's attorneys maintain the deal
would violate antitrust laws. He said the board has determined,
with the advice of the company's financial adviser, Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., ``that the increased per- share price of the offer remains
inadequate.''
   Hahn disputed Laidig's contentions in a statement Tuesday. ``A
$5 increase certainly is not modest,'' he said.
   ``I wonder how many of Great Northern's shareholders agree that
a 63 percent premium above the unaffected market price is
inadequate,'' Hahn said.
   Georgia-Pacific said it would continue its effort to present the
bid to Great Northern stockholders.
   Great Northern rejected the first offer as too low, illegal on
antitrust grounds and potentially disastrous for the combined
company. Great Northern filed an antitrust suit in federal court.
   Hahn's Sunday letter disputed Great Northern's contentions about
the deal's financial implications. He also demanded a special
meeting of Great Northern shareholders and urged Laidig to meet
with him personally to discuss the proposal.
   ``We are prepared to consider an additional increase in price if
you come to the negotiating table early and demonstrate to our
satisfaction that greater value exists,'' he wrote.
   Prior to Great Northern's rejection announcement,
Georgia-Pacific filed an amended lawsuit against Great Northern in
U.S. District Court in Portland, Maine, accusing Great Northerns's
directors of shirking their duty to shareholders by ignoring the
tender offer.
   The lawsuit also accuses Great Northern directors of plotting to
thwart the takeover by setting up ``golden parachutes,'' to pay
hundreds of thousands of dollars to executives in the event they
lose their jobs in a takeover.
   Georgia-Pacific, which employs 44,000 people, had revenue of
$9.5 billion last year from sales of paper, other forest products
and building materials. It is based in Atlanta.
   Norwalk, Conn.-based Great Northern, with 20,000 workers and
1988 sales of $3.6 billion, makes paper, containers and envelopes.
   The amended lawsuit claims that after Georgia-Pacific made the
offer, Laidig ``refused to take even the minimal steps necessary to
begin to apprise himself of the potential benefits to shareholders
of a negotiated resolution (or even simply of further talks),
benefits about which he could not possibly have known, much less
conclusively evaluated.''
   It also accuses Great Northern of setting up a ``tin parachute''
plan that could cost millions of additional dollars in payments to
some 5,850 non-union employees who might lose their jobs in a
takeover.
   Laidig disputed the contention that extra compensation voted by
the board was a ``golden parachute'' plan.
   The original lawsuit, amended by Tuesday's filing, challenged
Great Northern's by-laws and Maine's anti-takeover statute, which
require hostile suitors to wait five years before they take over a
company, unless the directors of the target company approve the
deal.

<HEAD>Futures Contracts in 2-Year Treasury Notes, Differentials Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Tuesday approved a
request by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to allow it to begin
trading options on Euro-rate differential futures contracts in the
British pound, Japanese yen and German mark.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also approved a
proposal by the Amex Commodities Corp. to trade futures contracts
on two-year U.S. Treasury notes. Amex Commodities Corp. is a
subsidiary of the American Stock Exchange.
   The trading unit for Amex's new futures contract is a two-year
Treasury note with a face value of $1 million at maturity. The
contract will be settled through physical delivery.
   The single deliverable issue for a particular delivery month is
the two-year note auctioned by the Treasury in that month. Prices
will be quoted as a percentage of annualized yield-to-maturity.
   In the Chicago option contracts, holders will have the right to
buy or sell the relevent underlying Euro-rate differential _ known
as a DIFF _ futures contract. Each of the underlying DIFF futures
contracts is based on the difference between the interest rate on
Eurodollars _ U.S. currency held in foreign banks _ and the
interest rate on the particular foreign currency, either yen,
pounds or marks.
   So-called Eurocurrency, like Eurodollars, is money from one
country, such as Britain, deposited in the bank of another, such as
Italy or Japan.

<HEAD>Hospital Chain Flees Beverly Hills for Cheaper Dallas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Medical International, the
hospital operator recently taken private in a $1.67 billion deal,
said Tuesday it will relocate to Texas.
   AMI, the nation's third-largest hospital chain, said it will
move its corporate headquarters from this pricey Los Angeles suburb
to the Dallas area next September.
   ``Dallas represents significant cost savings over Beverly
Hills,'' AMI chairman Harry J. Gray said in a statement. ``It is
more central in relation to our hospitals, which are located across
the Sunbelt from the Southeastern states, including Florida, to
California.''
   Gray is a partner in IMA Holdings, an investment group that
teamed with First Boston Corp. to buy AMI with the backing of
Chicago's wealthy Pritzker family.
   The company, which has a total of 1,500 administrative
employees, said some of the 200 workers at its corporate
headquarters Hills would be moved to Dallas, while others would be
laid off.
   Employees at a data center near Marina del Rey and at an
insurance and benefits unit in Costa Mesa will keep their jobs at
those locations, AMI said.
   AMI has said it will lay off an undetermined number of its
40,000 employees worldwide and sell its 23 foreign hospitals and
some of its 48 hospitals in the United States as part of a
cost-cutting reorganization.
   AMI's relocation to the Dallas area follows an exodus of other
corporations to the area in recent years, including J.C. Penney Co.
Inc. and Exxon Corp.

   Southwest Air Lines of Okinawa, Japan, has
ordered four Boeing 737-400s and taken options on another four in a
deal worth about $160 million, Boeing Co. said Tuesday.
   Southwest would become the first Japanese carrier to operate the
737-400, a twin-engine jetliner that can seat 145 to 170 people.
The airline already has seven of the older-model 737-200s.
   Boeing has sold 180 737-400s to 23 customers since the model
entered commercial service in September 1988. In the two decades
since the 737 was introduced, 2,723 have been ordered, making it
the most popular commercial airplane in history.
   So far this year, Boeing has received firm orders for 882
commercial jets worth about $46.2 billion, both industry records.

<HEAD>Creditors' Agreement Staves Off Liquidation Order in Hunt Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former billionaires William Herbert Hunt and
Nelson Bunker Hunt on Tuesday filed a joint $105 million
reorganization plan approved by their major creditors, who have
been at odds for months.
   Attorneys for the Hunts and for Minpeco S.A. and Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. of New York signed the plans and filed them in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas. Other creditors have until Dec. 15
to file objections.
   The reorganization agreements could head off a bankruptcy
judge's threat to convert the brothers' bankruptcies from Chapter
11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation of their assets.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson notified all parties two
weeks ago that without an agreement by Nov. 20 he would convert the
cases to Chapter 7 status.
   The agreements filed Tuesday were reached verbally Monday
following hours of closed-door meetings, after which Abramson said
he would defer the liquidation order until Dec. 15.
   Several of the attorneys said Tuesday the plan wouldn't have
come about without such pressure.
   ``It was a combination of the judge ordering conversion of
Herbert's case as well as the IRS telling us that if we didn't have
plans by the end of the year ... they would seek conversion of the
case,'' said Barbara Houser, a Dallas bankruptcy attorney
representing Minpeco, a mining company owned by the Peruvian
government.
   Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, a debtor is
allowed to continue to operate with protection from creditors'
claims while a debt repayment schedule is arranged. Under Chapter
7, assets are sold to pay creditors.
   According to bankruptcy court filings, William Herbert has $169
million in assets and Bunker has assets of $250 million.
   Under terms of the agreement, the IRS would get 70 percent of
William Herbert's estate, valued at $125 million, and unsecured
creditors would get another 30 percent.
   Nelson Bunker Hunt would pay 80 percent of his estate, valued at
$150 million, to the Internal Revenue Service and 20 percent to
unsecured creditors.
   The Hunts would be able to keep their personal effects, but
Abramson ordered an auction of a coin collection and antiques.
   Major creditors said they would have received nothing under a
fire-sale Chapter 7 liquidation, and most of the money from the
estates would have gone to the IRS.
   ``We couldn't be happier,'' said Stephen McCartin, head attorney
for Herbert Hunt, who had asked for a delay in Abramson's
conversion order.
   The compromise between Manufacturers Hanover and Minpeco
refocuses both cases away from liquidation.
   Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover are each to receive 34.6
percent _ or $36.6 million _ of each brother's estate. The total of
all allowed claims is $105.8 million.
   Minpeco has been trying to collect a $132 million court judgment
against the brothers stemming from their alleged attempt in 1979-80
to corner the silver market, which ended with the collapse of
silver prices. With attorneys' fees and interest, the judgment has
swelled to more than $250 million.
   Other creditors _ led by Manufacturers Hanover, which is owed
$36 million _ have argued that Minpeco already has recovered its
silver losses from other third-party defendants and that the money
would be better spent paying other creditors.
   Abramson has allowed only $20 million of the Peruvian mining
concern's claim.

   South Korea's trade surplus with the
United States from January to October fell to $3.76 billion, a 44.4
percent drop compared with the same period last year, the Korea

of this year dropped 1.8 percent from a year ago to $16.8 billion,
while imports from America jumped 26.2 percent to $13.04 billion,
according to the association.
   Korea's trade surplus with the European Economic Community
during the period dropped 60 percent to $680 million.
   Korea's trade deficit with Japan during the 10 months stood at
$3.27 billion, up 0.5 percent or $17 million from a year ago.
