   Attorneys said Friday they had reached a settlement
of the wrongful death lawsuit filed against the widow of Arthur
Kane, who killed a Merrill Lynch manager and himself after the 1987
stock market crash.
   Kane, financially wiped out by ``Black Monday,'' walked into the
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. office in Miami on Oct. 26, 1987, one week after
the crash, killing office manager Jose Argilagos and paralyzing his
broker, Lloyd Kolokoff.
   Attorneys R.W. ``Buddy'' Payne and Frank Areces, representing
Argilagos, announced the case was settled, but that Dade County
Circuit Judge Martin Greenbaum ordered that the amount of damages
not be disclosed.
   Kane, 53, was actually Arthur Katz, a disbarred lawyer and
federally protected witness relocated to Miami. His testimony in
Philadelphia helped convict mob figures in a 1977 stock fraud case,
which drew death threats from organized crime figures.
   In testimony Thursday, Kolokoff said Kane's depression grew
steadily worse.
   ``After the crash, he was really depressed _ in a state of
shock,'' Kolokoff said. ``As the week wore on, he talked about
wanting to kill himself.''
   Kolokoff, his wife Wanda and Argilagos' survivors filed the civil
suit against Kane's wife, Judith.
   The settlement Friday resolved a lawsuit by Kolokoff, one by the
family of Argilagos, and on Thursday that he had listened to Kane's
increasingly desperate talk about overdosing on drugs or carbon
monoxide and tried to convince him he could bounce back.
   ``It was money; it wasn't his life,'' Kolokoff recalled telling
him. ``He just wouldn't listen to anything.''
   The day before the shooting, a week after the market crash, Kane
called Kolokoff at home, the broker said. Kolokoff assured him that
he was a valuable customer and that Merrill Lynch would work with
him.
   However, when Kane came in Monday planning to pay $60,000 to
$70,000 to keep his account open, he was told he needed $130,000.
Kane said he would return with the money.
   He came back later, went into Argilagos' office with Kolokoff,
and pulled his gun. ``Mr. Kane took out the gun and said: `Take
this, Jose,' and fired one shot,'' Kolokoff said. ``And that's the
last thing I remember.''
   Now a paraplegic, Kolokoff said his life is dominated by pain.
His income has dropped to $45,000, compared to 1987 when he was on
track to earn $295,000, he said, and his medical bills exceeded
$324,000.
   Kolokoff said he overcame early depression with determination to
live. ``I want to live,'' he said. ``I have a really good family. I
can't even think about losing them.''

<HEAD>Coupon Redemption Fraud Couple Get Stiff Sentences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who were the only two of 62
defendants who went to trial in a $12 million coupon-redemption
fraud have received stiff prison sentences.
   William Winokur refused to plead guilty for his part in the
scheme but was sentenced Thursday to 17 years. His wife, Florence,
who turned down the state's offer of five years' probation, was
sentenced to seven years.
   Broward Circuit Judge Leroy Moe gave William Winokur the maximum
sentence under the state's guidelines. That was more than triple the
time the coupon fraud mastermind, Larry Krasnick, received after
admitting his guilt in a plea deal.
   Florence Winokur faced a maximum penalty of nine years. Besides
serving prison time, Moe ordered the Winokurs to pay $230,000 in
restitution and each serve 10 years' probation.
   The state offered Winokur a 2{-year sentence when he was arrested
more than a year ago. ``I would have loved to give him 2{ years,''
Moe said before he sentenced the Winokurs.
   ``All he had to do was say he did it. And he'd probably be
walking the streets now'' because prison overcrowding means that
most inmates serve only about a third of their sentences.
   ``I don't think there wasn't a person associated with the case
that didn't urge them to take a deal,'' Moe said. ``I'm not
responsible for their choices.''
   The Winokurs were convicted three weeks ago on charges of
racketeering, grand theft and conspiracy. They operated stores in
Dade, Palm Beach and Broward counties in 1986-88 solely to illegally
redeem coupons.
   The stores had products on their shelves but the Winokurs seldom
made a sale, according to prosecutors. The shops were set up as
facades to redeem $200,000 worth of coupons for products never sold.
   The enterprise, which involved 81 stores, bought coupons in bulk
from charitable organizations and had other people clip, sort and
crumple coupons to make them look handled by consumers.

   A police officer got his nose out of joint
and arrested a budding professional clown for wearing a plastic nose
and failing to get out of her car during a recent drug crackdown.
   Nancy Cherrington, a 47-year-old mother of two, spent 5{ hours in
jail and faces up to 18 months behind bars and $1,500 in fines. But
that won't stop her from wearing a plastic nose when she appears in
court.
   She was arrested Aug. 4 when she and her 20-year-old son visited
a friend. Deputies investigating for drugs had set up a roadblock
and were stopping all cars entering an apartment complex.
   She had popped on one of her favorite dime store noses with
bright yellow glasses attached.
   But the fake nose failed to tickle Deputy Jimmie Jones, who
ordered her to take it off and get out of the car. When she refused,
she was arrested and charged with wearing a mask in public and
resisting arrest without violence.
   The nose was confiscated as evidence.
   ``She was being a real smart aleck,'' the officer said. ``It
wasn't a situation to make jokes in.''
   Mrs. Cherrington said Thursday that the time spent in the Orange
County Jail taught her a lesson.
   ``You get a headache laying your head on those hard wood seats
that everyone uses as a bed,'' she said. ``Now maybe if a police
officer says get out of the car I won't take so long.''
   Still, she plans to be herself when she appears in court. ``I'll
definitely pop my nose on for the judge,'' she said.

   Threats by protesters failed to keep
truckers away from Debbie Duz Donuts, which has topless waitresses,
adult videos, doughnuts and coffee.
   As a dozen protesters stood across the street carrying signs with
slogans such as, ``Welcome to the Pit of Iniquity,'' a thin but
steady stream of customers ventured inside Friday to pay $2 for a
doughnut and cup of coffee served by one of six waitresses wearing
only shorts and shoes.
   Shop owner Dennis Cortese hustled around the store coordinating
waitresses and workers. He opened for a sneak preview about three
weeks ago, but many truckers stayed away, waiting for the publicity
to die down, Cortese said.
   On Friday, the first trucker pulled into the parking lot off
Interstate 25 a half-hour after the shop opened about noon. Two
others arrived a few minutes later.
   ``I just kind of wondered what was going on,'' said Jeb Hansen,
driving an 18-wheel truck for a Montana company. ``I dropped some
lambs off, I had to make a phone call and I thought I'd have a
doughnut and a cup of coffee.''
   The trucker said he wasn't concerned about the protesters who
were filming customers. Opponents have promised to notify trucking
companies of their drivers' whereabouts.
   ``They won't care,'' Hansen said. ``They'll get a kick out of
it.''
   Patrons chatted with English topless model Debby Ann Trent, hired
by Cortese for the shop's opening, or spent $5 for a photograph with
her.
   Debby Duz Donuts also has an adult entertainment room with
magazines, videos and posters.
   Opponents have gathered 7,000 signatures on a petition against
the shop.
   ``Our ultimate goal is to shut Debbie Duz Donuts down,'' said
Cheri Peters.
   She complained that county commissioners, ``because they fear a
lawsuit from Cortese, can't make a law to get him out of the state.''
   ``To get him out of the state, we have to go through the state
Legislature,'' she said.
   Protests would continue, she promised.
   A few supporters of the doughnut shop plan to picket, too.
Charles Curley of Fort Collins said he will carry signs because ``I
don't like a small vocal minority telling us what shops can open.''
   He said he has not visited Debbie Duz Donuts.

<TEXT>
   Two men accused of trying to export weapons,
including anti-helicopter missiles, to the Irish Republican Army
have pleaded innocent to charges of conspiring to violate federal
arms export regulations.
   Richard Clark Johnson, an electrical engineer from Harwich, and
Gerald Vincent Hoy, a computer scientist from Easton, Pa., were
among five people accused in a grand jury indictment handed up last
week.
   Johnson and Hoy pleaded Friday before U.S. District Judge A.
David Mazzone, who set a $25,000 bond for Hoy and took his passport.
Johnson already had been released on bail by a federal magistrate.
   Two other defendants, Christina Leigh Reid, an electrical
engineering student from Sunnyvale, Calif., and Martin Peter
Quigley, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who is in federal
custody in Pennsylvania, will be arraigned Tuesday, Mazzone said.
   A fifth defendant, Peter Eamon McGuire, is a fugitive believed to
be in Ireland.
   Mazzone said the trial probably would be early next year.
   Federal investigators allege the five worked for the Provisional
IRA, the guerrilla wing of the nationalist group fighting to end
British rule in the six counties of Northern Ireland.
   Federal prosecutor Richard Stearns said the case includes FBI
telephone taps and evidence including radar and missile parts.
   Johnson is charged with developing for illegal export ``remote
control detonation systems to facilitate a bombing campaign.''
   Hoy is accused of working with Quigley to ``develop, test and
export a missile and rocket system to be used against British Army
helicopters in Northern Ireland.''

   Two women hijacked a helicopter at gunpoint
Friday, snatched two inmates from a prison yard and fled the region
in a waiting van, but all four were captured after a shootout in
Nebraska, authorities said.
   ``We can confirm they were taken into custody, all four of
them,'' said Juanita Novak, a spokesman for the Colorado Department
of Corrections.
   The wild shootout in Holdrege, Neb., involved a
gunfire-punctuated pursuit of a rented van through a residential
neighborhood, said a witness to the final showdown.
   ``They crossed a median and hit a tree,'' the witness, a woman
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We could definitely see they
had guns and were shooting. The police tried to arrest them by
swerving in front of the truck but they ran up into a yard.''
   The nine-minute chase began when a Holdrege police officer
spotted the yellow van at 6:18 p.m. and the pursuit wound through
town until it ended at 6:27 p.m., said Phelps County Attorney Glenn
Clark.
   The shooting started after the van struck a police car head-on,
Clark said. ``After the first encounter they went down the street
shooting houses and at people,'' he said.
   About eight officers were involved in the chase and about five
were shot at, he said. At least eight shots penetrated the car's
windshield, police said.
   The van stopped and the four were arrested without further
resistance after one of the men was shot, Clark said. ``One of them
was hit and was bleeding pretty bad,'' Clark said. ``He's fine. He
just got hit in the hand.''
   Ralph Brown was at Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney with a
shotgun pellet possibly lodged in a finger on his right hand, said
Phelps County Sheriff Dwayne Newman.
   Holdrege Police Chief Ken Jackson said there were no other
injuries, despite indiscriminate shooting by the suspects as police
converged on them in this farming town of about 5,600 people in
south-central Nebraska, about 40 miles north of the Kansas line.
   Deputy County Rebecca Miller said police confiscated a 9mm
automatic and a .22-caliber pistol.
   Clark said the other man and woman were being held at the Phelps
County Jail, the other woman was being held at Holdrege police
headquarters. The prosecutor said he expected the four would be in
court Monday.
   None of the four was formally charged, Clark said. ``We've got
plenty to hold them on,'' he added.
   Another witness, John Swenson, said he and his neighbor Jim Brenn
ducked ducked behind Brenn's pickup truck when the shooting began
about two houses away.
   ``I saw the gun come out of the passenger side of the van and
then they never stopped shooting,'' Swenson said. ``It was just like
on TV. These were big guns, not little ones.''
   Mayor Helen Anderson said the town was quiet again at about 9
p.m. ``There's probably some pretty excited people,'' she said.
``We're not accustomed to this.''
   In the brazen, daylight prison break, frustrated guards held
their fire because they could not get a clear shot at the helicopter
and feared that the pilot was being held hostage, said Liz
McDonough, a corrections spokewoman.
   Nevertheless, authorities ordered an investigation to determine
why a guard refused three orders from prison superintendent Jim
Brittain to open fire on the helicopter.
   ``From the time the helicopter came into view, from the point of
touchdown to takeoff, was 10 to 15 seconds,'' Brittain said. ``My
recollection was that as the inmates were diving headfirst into the
helicopter, it was lifting off.''
   The pilot was found bound and gagged about 35 miles north of the
medium-security state prison and the helicopter was found nearby
after authorities received an anonymous telephone call.
   Authorities said the women were believed to be wives of the
escaped inmates, even though one of the women gave the name of a
former deputy sheriff who had been fired for fraternizing with
inmates.
   The two escaped inmates were cellmates. The women and the
escapees apparently transferred to a rented van and eluded police.
   Authorities set up roadblocks on highways leading from the prison
and the Colorado National Guard provided helicopters for the search.
   The inmates were identified as Freddie Gonzales, 21, who was
serving a four-year sentence for robbery, and Brown, 21, who was
sentenced for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation in a
bad check charge.
   Gonzales would have been eligible for parole in September 1991,
while Brown's parole eligibility date was October 1996.
   One of the woman who rented the helicopter identified herself as
Julie Quinn, a former Arapahoe County deputy fired for
fraternization, but from descriptions given by the pilot,
authorities now believe the hijacking was carried out by Pat
Gonzales and Rebecca Brown, wives of the two inmates.
   The women apparently had planned to hijack a helicopter earlier
in the week, but their plans had to be delayed for several days due
to bad weather, McDonough said.
   The women rented the helicopter from Helicopter Airways in
Denver, saying they wanted to take some photos of real estate near
the prison, said Walter Kautzky, director of the state Corrections
Department.
   Once near the prison, one woman pulled a gun and ordered the
pilot to land, Kautzky said. The Arkansas Valley Correctional
Facility in Crowley County is about 50 miles east of Pueblo, on the
plains of southeastern Colorado.
   After the escape, the helicopter flew north and the pilot was
forced to land near a farmhouse and the rental truck. The pilot, Tim
Graves, was taken to the farmhouse where he was bound and gagged.
   Graves later was taken to the Lincoln County Jail in Hugo for
security, authorities said. He was being interviewed by police.
   The incident was the latest in a rash of helicopter prison
escapes and attempts. In April, a helicopter crashed after its tail
rotor snagged on a fence at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center in Miami, Fla. The pilot and the prisoner survived.
   In July 1988, a woman hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot
to land in the prison yard at the Penitentiary of New Mexico near
Albuquerque. Three convicts escped but later were captured.
   In November 1986, an inmate escaped from the minimum-security
federal prison in Pleasanton, Calif. He later hijacked a helicopter
and returned to the prison to free a woman inmate who worked with
him in the prison business office. They were captured 10 days later
while buying wedding rings.

   They're nuts about white squirrels in
Marionville. Just ask the folks at the White Squirrel Furniture
Store, the White Squirrel Car Wash or the White Squirrel Hollow Bed
&amp; Breakfast.
   And watch where you're driving: A 21-year-old city ordinance
imposes a $500 fine for deliberately injuring or killing one of the
rare albino squirrels. Motorists must yield right of way to them.
   No one has ever been arrested for violating the law, but that
doesn't mean it's taken lightly.
   ``If I catch somebody killing a white squirrel, I will issue a
citation,'' said Police Chief Jesse Merritt, who wears a
squirrel-emblazoned shoulder patch on his uniform. ``It's no joke.''
   Some people even go so far as to trap the albinos' gray cousins
and banish them from the small southwest Missouri town to give the
white squirrels first crack at the nuts.
   Marionville, home to 2,000 people and nearly half that many white
squirrels, has a billboard welcoming visitors to the ``Home of the
White Squirrel.''
   Only one other community in the nation _ Olney, Ill. _ is known
to have a sizable concentration of the snow-white squirrels, but
Marionville's colony is much larger, says James Smart, a local
authority and booster of the animal.
   ``We've blown Olney off the map,'' he boasts. Olney has a measly
few dozen squirrels, he figures.
   Wildlife experts say finding any albino animal colony the size of
Marionville's is rare.
   ``Normally you see an albino show up occasionally in a population
such as squirrels or birds or deer, but entire populations are not
something you come across all that frequently,'' said Eric
Kurzejeski, a state wildlife research biologist.
   Signs of Marionville's affection for the white squirrel, which
mates and otherwise interacts normally with its gray cousin, are
everywhere.
   The Lions Club sells white squirrel T-shirts and pins to raise
money to buy redwood boxes that are placed in trees as homes for the
squirrels. More than 500 dens have been put up, and volunteers have
planted hundreds of nut trees.
   ``We've had orders for T-shirts from Kalamazoo, Mich., to Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Memphis, Kentucky,'' says Smart, a Lions
member. ``Marionville is a small town, but people who grew up here
and moved away still remember their roots and want to help the white
squirrel.''
   White squirrels first appeared in Marionville around 1860, Smart
says. According to local legend, a couple of the critters escaped
from a traveling circus and began multiplying, or were the product
of a weird experiment by a local scientist.
   Smart became fascinated by white squirrels when one showed up on
the deck of his home about 12 years ago. He set out to increase the
population by trapping the more numerous gray squirrels in the woods
around his home and releasing them several miles away to provide
more room for the whites.
   ``We trapped 110 gray squirrels in a year and a half,'' he said.
``It was just amazing what the whites did then.''
   Smart estimates that about three dozen albino squirrels live in
30 den boxes and in trees on his heavily wooded property.
   ``I have one picture at home with 17 white squirrels in it,'' he
said.
   Retirees Johnie and Ann Clark spend hours on their back porch
watching the white squirrels munch corn and walnuts placed at their
feeders. The couple had no white squirrels until Smart transplanted
some there a few years ago.
   ``They'll play just like a little kitten,'' Mrs. Clark said.
``There will be five or six in the yard looking for something to eat
and I'll say, `Don't leave, Johnie's bringing you something.' I
swear they can understand me.''
   Diana Wise, who runs the White Squirrel Hollow Bed &amp; Breakfast
with her husband, Clint, says people come for miles to see the
animals.
   ``A lot of people don't really believe we have white squirrels
because they stop at noon and don't see them,'' she said. ``The best
time to see them is 6:30 or 7 in the morning and around 7, 7:30 at
night when they're feeding. They don't like the heat and I think the
light hurts their pink eyes.''
   Smart used to hunt gray squirrels (``Young squirrel, fried, with
biscuits and gravy _ you can't beat it''), but not anymore.
   ``The squirrels are a hobby, a challenge for me now,'' he says.
``I guess I'm paying back for all the hunting I used to do.''

   The seventh tropical depression of the Atlantic
hurricane season formed Friday off the African coast, forecasters
reported.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the depression's poorly defined center was
near latitude 17.6 degrees north and longitude 28.5 west, about 200
miles west of the Cape Verde island of Sal, according to the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   The depression, moving west-northwest at about 18 mph, is
expected to slow during the weekend and turn toward the northwest,
the center reported. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 35
mph.
   The depression would become a named tropical storm if maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane
once its top sustained winds reach 74 mph.
   Two of the previous six depressions this year have become
hurricanes. The second, Dean, dissipated earlier this month in the
North Atlantic after causing minor damage in Bermuda.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30.

   The National Park Service is negotiating with
its counterparts in the Soviet Union to establish a park spanning
the Bering Strait, according to Saturday editions of the Washington
Post.
   Park officials will visit Siberian areas across the strait from
Alaska next month and return with Soviet officials who will inspect
Alaskan sites, the newspaper said.
   The service already administers the Bering Land Bridge National
Preserve, a 2.7-million acre wild area just north of Nome. There is
no comparable preserve on the Soviet side.
   Such a park could make it easier for scientists to conduct
research on both sides of the border and make it easier for wildlife
biologists to track migratory species like walrus moving between the
two countries.
   In the last Ice Age, the strait was dry, which permitted people
and animals to move between Asia and North America.
   The newspaper said the park project, still embryonic, is known
around the headquarters of the park service as ``glasnost and the
glaciers.''

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the nation's largest pharmacy
chain pleaded innocent Friday to charges of bribing an Ohio Pharmacy
Board member and of possession of criminal tools.
   Rite Aid Corp. president Martin L. Grass, 35, entered the plea in
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court before Judge Jose A. Villanueva.
Grass is free on $100,000 bond. He declined to comment on the case
after the hearing.
   His Shiremanstown, Pa.-based company later released a three-page
statement saying the indictment against Grass and the company is
``bizarre.''
   ``They (Grass and Rite Aid) have indicated that the charge of
bribery is a vicious attempt to blemish the corporation and its
president and have called the charge absurd,'' the release said.
   The indictment alleged that Grass and the company used an
aircraft as the criminal tool last March and April.
   Grass was arrested April 27 at a hotel near Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport. Prosecutors said the arrest came after the
alleged bribe was videotaped.
   On June 14, a grand jury handed up a secret indictment accusing
Grass of offering a $33,000 bribe to Melvin Wilczynski, a member of
the State Board of Pharmacy, in exchange for his stepping down from
the board.
   Prosecutors have said the company and Grass wanted to get control
of the board and fire its executive director, Franklin Z. Wickham.
Rite Aid said Wickham had been harassing the company in enforcing
pharmacy regulations.
   The indictment was unsealed Aug. 1.
   Both charges are felonies. The bribery charge carries a maximum
prison term of 10 years and a $5,000 fine. Possession of criminal
tools is punishable by a maximum five years in prison and $2,500

   Griffin O'Neal, the son of actor Ryan O'Neal,
was sentenced to clean up gang graffiti and perform other community
service after pleading no contest to a drunken driving charge.
   O'Neal, 24, who was not present at the hearing Friday, was
sentenced to three years' unsupervised probation, fined about $800
and ordered to attend an alcohol education program, said Deputy City
Attorney Laura Van Eyk.
   He was not required to attend the misdemeanor sentencing, she
said.
   The aspiring actor was arrested Oct. 2, 1988, after police
officers in the San Fernando Valley observed him straddling lanes in
his brown-and-pink 1957 Chrysler, Ms. Van Eyk said.
   Blood tests revealed a blood alcohol level of 0.13 percent, 0.03
percent above the legal limit, she said.

   Cher's manager is questioning MTV's decision to
restrict the airtime of Cher's video ``If I Could Turn Back Time,''
which MTV says shows more of Cher than some people want to see.
   The clip features Cher _ wearing a thin, carefully-placed
V-shaped outfit and sheer stockings _ performing on the deck of a
troop ship.
   ``When we accepted it, we felt it was borderline,'' Abbey
Konowitch, MTV vice president for programming, said Friday. ``We
received a great deal of negative feedback from our audience.''
   The video will only be aired from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., said
Konowitch.
   Cher's manager, Bill Sammeth, said MTV's decision was like
closing the barn door after the horse was gone: ``They think it
shows too much of her, but they allowed it for eight weeks.''

   Band leader Xavier Cugat has recovered
from a heart ailment and left a hospital after a monthlong stay.
   Cugat, 89, was ``in perfect shape'' Friday when he was released
from the Quiron Clinic, said spokeswoman Isabel Mas.
   He entered the hospital with a problem in his left ventricle.
Cugat, who is generally credited with introducing tropical rhythms
into American dance music, has suffered four heart attacks and a
stroke since 1980.
   The band leader became a U.S. star in the 1930s. He was born in
Spain and moved with his family to Cuba as a child. In 1970, he
turned over his band to Tito Puente, and a decade later returned to
Barcelona.

   The daughter of artist Willem de Kooning is
looking for a gallery to represent his works after gaining control
of the painter's estate.
   De Kooning, 85, was declared mentally incompetent Friday by a
judge who gave control of the estate, including $150 million in art,
to Lisa de Kooning, sole heir to de Kooning's fortune, and family
attorney John Eastman.
   The artist was one of the first leaders of the abstract
expressionist movement. He paints daily in his East Hampton studio
despite suffering from Alzheimer's disease. His daughter, 33, lives
next door.
   Eastman said he and Lisa will audit and inventory the artist's
collection, which may include up to 300 paintings covering his
entire career.
   ``This is going to be a very big undertaking,'' said Eastman, an
associate of de Kooning's for the past 20 years. ``This is the first
time that a living artist as great as this has had such a volume of
work gathered.''

   Actor James Woods says he has hit a fellow actor
and worn high heels to gear up for performances.
   The star of the movies ``Salvador'' and ``The Onion Field'' said
he ``whacked'' Robert Downey Jr. ``across the side of the head and
knocked him over, knocked his glasses across the room.''
   Woods told Smart magazine in its September-October issue that
during filming of ``True Believer,'' Downey ``was missing the magic
that I knew he was capable of.'' A stunned Downey finished the
scene, then laughed. ``I just woke him up for a second,'' Woods said.
   Woods recalled also that ``Bobby De Niro once sent me a pair of
red high-heeled pumps from Frederick's of Hollywood before I did a
scene in `Once Upon a Time in America,'''
   ``So I just walked in, wearing my tux and my old-rubber-head
makeup and these big, fluffy, feathery, high-heeled, blazing-red
spiked heels. I think maybe I was being too serious or something,
and that kind of lightened me up a bit.''

   A 72-year-old Chinatown businessman pleaded
guilty in federal court on Friday to charges that he led a drug ring
that dealt hundreds of pounds of heroin into the city.
   Peter Woo, an influential leader in New York's Chinese community,
told U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie that he conspired with
his codefendants to possess heroin and distribute it in Queens and
other parts of the city.
   Woo served as a broker who brought wholesale heroin buyers and
sellers together, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles E. Rose.
   He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine when he
is sentenced by Dearie. No sentencing date had been set.
   Woo, owner of a Chinatown liquor store, was arrested in February
when federal and city authorities broke up the drug ring, seized 820
pounds of high-grade Asian heroin worth $1 billion and confiscated
$3 million in cash.
   At the time of the arrests the FBI director in charge of the New
York office, James M. Fox, said the heroin bust was the largest ever
in the United States.
   Federal authorities have charged 29 others with participating in
the organization. Woo, alleged leader of the ring, was the first to
enter a plea, Rose said. He remained in custody on $2 million bail.
   Woo, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Canton, China, and
came to the United States about three decades ago. He owned a liquor
store on Mott Street and ran the Chinatown Democratic Club in the
same building.

   Two children who were spirited from New
Hampshire to Montana by their mother after her ex-husband was
acquitted of sexually molesting their daughter must be returned to
New England, a judge ruled Friday.
   Rockingham County Superior Court Judge Douglas Gray ruled that
Jesse and Mark Murabito's 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter be
placed in a New Hampshire foster home pending a hearing Sept. 1.
   Mrs. Murabito's attorney, Alan Rosenfeld, criticized Gray's
decision on a petition by Murabito, and said he would try to obtain
an emergency order to keep the children in Fort Denton, Montana.
   Mrs. Murabito, 40, contends the children would be in danger if
they lived with her 34-year-old ex-husband at his home in Derry.
   In November, after Murabito was found innocent in the sexual
abuse case, his ex-wife disappeared with the children and began an
eight-month journey to Loma via an ``underground railway'' that
helps women in such situations.
   Murabito later was awarded custody.
   Last week, Montana authorities, tipped that Mrs. Murabito was
living in Loma under a false name, took the children from her.
Montana District Judge John Warner ordered on Thursday that the
children be kept in a state foster home until New Hampshire courts
called for their return.
   Gray said Friday that Montana authorities must deliver the
children to Exeter County sheriff's officers at Logan Airport in
Boston. They then will be taken to a foster home in New Hampshire,
where all parental visits will be supervised.
   The children, who are in Fort Denton, will not be placed with
either parent pending the Superior Court hearing next month.
   Murabito did not return telephone calls from The Associated
Press, and his lawyer, Raymond Kellett Jr. of Salem, could not be
reached for comment.

<HEAD>Rudeness the Issue in Recall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two officials facing a recall election
today said the town was wasting money on petty politics, but their
opponents said rudeness by officials was a bona fide issue.
   ``For one thing I think it's ridiculous because we're both up for
election in six months,'' said Selectman Raymond Gagnon, who
estimated the special election's cost at $10,000.
   Today, just more than a year after this town's citizens adopted a
bylaw allowing for recall elections, voters face the question of
whether the current five-member board has been ill-mannered and
unresponsive.
   The election features five candidates, including the two
incumbents, running for two seats.
   ``What it comes down to is there's been a small group of people
in the town hall who have been trying to operate the place like it's
their private club,'' said John R. Ward, who helped lead the recall
campaign that's pushing three alternative candidates.
   Ward said the selectmen betrayed the public in a variety of ways,
including at one point locking townspeople out of the town hall
during a meeting and snickering at people with whom they disagreed.
   ``There's just been abusive treatment. Laughing at people, making
comments. It's happened to me and it's happened to other people,''
said Ward, who lost a seat on the board in March by a narrow margin.
   Selectman Geraldine F. Noonan, who like Gagnon could be forced
from her post, disagreed.
   ``I can't remember any incident where any member on the board was
rude to people,'' she said. ``We listen to all the issues that come
before us. We certainly wouldn't degrade a person if we didn't agree
with an issue.''
   Residents in this town of 15,500 people south of Boston say the
bickering began in April when the board opted against renewing the
contract of Police Chief Walter Miller, who has since been demoted.
   The selectmen's decision was broadcast live on local cable
television and many people were bewildered because during the
chief's tenure crime had subsided.
   ``There was no debate, no discussion. And then when it was asked
why they weren't renewing his contract they refused to give a
reason,'' Ward said.
   Within days, 600 citizens had gathered to discuss the turn of
events, Ward said. Within months, more than 1,800 signatures had
been placed on a recall petition.

   Tadeusz Mazowiecki's opposition to the
Communist government once brought him a year in prison. Now, the
general who put him behind bars appears poised to appoint him prime
minister.
   The tall, taciturn 62-year-old Solidarity journalist is the least
publicly known of the three candidates the labor movement offered to
communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   But his links to Solidarity date to the August 1980 strikes that
created the union. And his activism goes back to the days after
World War II, when the Communists began consolidating power.
   Now, he is ready to accept Jaruzelski's expected offer to be the
first non-Communist head of an East bloc government, a circumstance
wrought by Solidarity's burgeoning political power.
   ``There have been several historical moments that show Poles can
strive for new solutions and unusual ones, really innovative ones,
and that we can get somewhere,'' he said Friday after meeting with
Jaruzelski.
   ``My hope is that such a moment is now arriving pyschologically _
that people will feel there is such a situation.''
   A close adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, Mazowiecki
edits the movement's weekly newspaper, Tygodnik Solidarnosc.
   He also is closely linked to the Roman Catholic church, and in
1957 helped found the Warsaw Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, an
influential forum that served as a bulwark for Catholic opposition
to Communist ideology.
   Mazowiecki was a key negotiator during the pivotal talks earlier
this year that resulted in the legalization of Solidarity and
opposition participation in elections. The talks were initiated by
authorities unable to control Poland's sinking economy and
disgruntled populace.
   He led the negotiating team that focuses on trade union freedoms,
participated in political discussions and fought for press freedoms
in a nation where the government controls all publications.
   Trained as a lawyer, he submitted the court application for
restoration of Solidarity's legal status provided for in the accords
reached with authorities.
   When the petition was granted on April 17, he stood on the
courthouse steps grinning broadly, arms raised and a bouquet of red
tulips in one hand.
   ``Today for me means the restoration of justice,'' he said then.
Recalling that he had been on hand when the union was first
legalized in 1980 _ it was outlawed 16 months later _ he added: ``I
hope I will not have to come here a third time.''
   On other days, though, he appears dour and even cold. Some
express concern that his Catholic faith and legal training have made
him overly deliberative and unable to react quickly.
   A widower who lost his young wife to cancer and still wears his
wedding ring, Mazowiecki raised three sons alone in a small
apartment on Warsaw's main commercial street.
   Born on April 18, 1927, in the small central Poland city of
Plock, Mazowiecki was raised in a family of intellectuals.
   By 21, he had been dismissed from his Academic Editing House job
for keeping close ties to the church during the early years of
Communist Poland.
   He began to work with PAX, an organization set up by the
government to dilute church-based opposition. But by 1955 he was so
at odds with the mix of politics and religion that he was suspended.
   In 1958, he founded the Catholic monthly magazine Wiez, or Link,
which he edited until 1981, when he began Tygodnik Solidarnosc.
   The Catholic magazine reflected, and to a degree preceded, the
modernization of Catholicism put forth by the second Vatican Council.
   He became aligned with ZNAK, a group supporting regeneration of
Poland based on Catholic values. Officially condoned under the
protection of the church, ZNAK had a Sejm delegation and Mazowiecki
became a parliament deputy in 1961.
   By 1970, Mazowiecki's agitation for democratization of public
life and social justice had run afoul of official tolerance and he
was not allowed another term.
   As the opposition began organizing in the mid-1970s, especially
after worker riots in 1976, Mazowiecki went to Western Europe in
search of support and aid. Mention of free trade unions in a West
German newspaper interview resulted in withdrawal of his passport
for four years.
   Wiez became a more radical forum, publishing articles by Adam
Michnik and other strong opposition voices.
   Mazowiecki initiated a letter by more than 60 intellectuals
urging authorities to find a peaceful solutions to the strikes that
erupted on the Baltic coast in August 1980 and led to Solidarity's
founding.
   On Aug. 22, he arrived at the strikebound Lenin shipyard in
Gdansk and after a nightlong talk with Walesa, Mazowiecki became the
head of a group of experts to help the workers organize the union
and negotiate with government officials.
   With the martial-law crackdown announced by Jaruzelski on Dec.
13, 1981, Mazowiecki was jailed. He was released on Dec. 23, 1982,
and resumed as a union adviser.
   After historically democratic elections were scheduled in June,
he did not run for office, preferring to edit the union's new legal
and independent weekly.

   Ralf and Thomas made it easily,
strolling to freedom in Austria, but escape from communist East
Germany for Joerg and Birgitt was a desperate crawl through fields
and mosquito-infested woods.
   ``We had no food or water, and sometimes we had no more
strength,'' Joerg, 27, said Friday after he and his wife arrived in
West Germany, still tired and sunburned from the three-day ordeal.
   Thousands of East Germans are flocking to West Germany to escape
the strict East German regime. Many go through liberal Hungary,
which is clearing the barbed wire from its border with Austria.
   About 100,000 East Germans are expected to reach West Germany
this year, by escape or with permission. One of the places they are
taken first is the overflowing camp in this city an hour's drove
northeast of Frankfurt.
   Birgitt, Joerg's 22-year-old wife, displayed cuts on her forearm
and said, ``I got these climbing over the barbed wire'' in a stretch
of the Hungarian border that had not been cleared.
   Like most of the others, Joerg and Birgitt fled because of the
East German government's resistance to the political and economic
reforms now spreading through the Soviet bloc with the Kremlin's
blessing.
   East Germans have difficulty getting permission to travel to the
West, but need no special permission to visit communist Hungary, so
it became an escape route when barricaded frontier was opened
earlier this year. More than 1,500 are believed to have used it
successfully.
   The young couple and other refugees interviewed at Giessen asked
that their surnames be withheld to avoid trouble for relatives at
home.
   ``We tried it a first time last week, but Hungarian border guards
caught us,'' Joerg said. ``They were nice. They just asked us to
promise never to do it again.''
   On the second try, a farmer with whom they hitched a ride dropped
them about six miles from the frontier on Aug. 13.
   Joerg said they didn't know where border controls were weakest,
so they crawled through scorching cornfields, brush and woods
searching for the right time and place.
   ``We knew some border fences had been removed, but we didn't know
where,'' he said. ``There are a lot of escapees who get help and
have access to information.''
   He and Birgitt hid in a cornfield the first night and in woods
the second, Joerg said.
   ``We lay low during daylight, carefully observing everything,''
he said. ``Then, at night, we would go inch by inch, very carefully,
to make sure we weren't noticed. There were millions of mosquitoes,
it was really hot and we had nothing to drink.''
   Birgitt remembered the exhaustion and fear of being separated.
   ``Sometimes we lost each other and could only find one another by
calling out,'' she said. ``There were times when I thought I just
couldn't go on.''
   They climbed the fence Tuesday near Deutschkreutz, about 90 miles
southeast of Vienna, and had a welcome drink from a brook. West
German authorities arranged passage to Vienna, then to the Giessen
camp, where they will be fed and housed until they can start a new
life.
   Because up to 500 East Germans arrive at Giessen on a single day,
the government announced Friday it was opening another camp.
   East Germans were lined up Friday outside the stucco camp
buildings at Giessen, waiting to fill out documents or for lunch in
the cafeteria. Others leaned through windows of their temporary
lodgings to talk with fellow refugees.
   Those who find lodgings with relatives usually leave Giessen in
three or four days, but others remain a week or more.
   Many recent escapees are young people who left jobs to go West,
like Ralf, a 20-year-old electrician, and his friend, Thomas, an
auto mechanic, who is 21.
   Ralf, from Leipzig, said they just walked across the border into
Austria.
   ``It took about three hours,'' he said. ``We had planned the
whole thing. Everything went according to our plans.''
   Jeannette, a 22-year-old from East Berlin, said it took her 13
hours to reach Austria through woods, brush and thorny bushes, and
she brought wire-cutters to snip through the fence.
   She said she said she found at least 25 other East Germans in an
Austrian border village.
   All those interviewed said they fled East Germany because they
were fed up with conditions there.
   ``There is no freedom to protest, no freedom of the press, no
freedom of opinion, and things are not going to change anytime
soon,'' Joerg said.

   Government health officials hope that more
inspectors, tougher laws and other regulatory changes will assure
the public that the scandal-tainted generic drug industry sells safe
products.
   The Food and Drug Administration and its parent agency, the
Department of Health and Human Services, announced a broad plan of
attack Friday aimed at serving notice to pharmaceutical
manufacturers _ and consumers _ that corrupt and fraudulent
practices must stop.
   ``I stand ready to work cooperatively with the Congress to meet
the legislative and budgetary requirements that are pivotal to
assuring full confidence in the generic drugs program,'' HHS
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in a written statement.
   The plan comes in the wake of months of revelations of gratuities
paid by companies to federal regulators and of false information
provided to the government by applicants for new drugs. There have
been no indications of unsafe generic drugs reaching the market.
   Sullivan and FDA Commissioner Frank Young announced they will
increase federal oversight of drug manufacturers and their products
and revamp procedures used to review drug applications.
   Two sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said
the FDA would spend $18 million to hire additional inspectors.
   Agency spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the final figure had not been
determined. But he said an undetermined number of new employees
would be hired for field work such as inspections of manufacturing
plants, and to check applications submitted to FDA by developers of
new drugs.
   To pay for the additional work, Sullivan and Young proposed fees
that would be levied on companies applying for permission to market
new generic drugs. There currently are no application fees.
   The government has the power to ban the sales of drugs that it
learns were approved after companies provided fraudulent information
to regulators.
   Sources said the proposed legislation would give the government
authority to remove a drug from the market if investigators prove
other types of fraud, such as gratuities to regulators for checking
one company's application before another's, in the approval process.
   Companies wishing to obtain federal approval to sell a new drug
test it and submit the results to the FDA, which checks the records
of the work. Producers must satisfy the FDA that their product
functions equivalently to the drug they are mimicking.
   The government also said it would create an ombudsman within FDA
to hear complaints from the pharmaceutical industry, consumers and
agency whistle blowers. The division within FDA that currently
oversees generic drugs would be raised a notch in the agency's
structure, giving it more clout. And Sullivan said drug review
procedures would be ``reorganized and strengthened.''
   On Wednesday, the FDA said it had started collecting thousands of
samples of the 30 most commonly used generic drugs so it could
conduct safety tests on them.
   The $5 billion generic drug industry is ferociously competitive,
as dozens of mostly small and mid-size companies vie to market
copies of brandname drugs after patents expire. The first such
generic drug to hit the market generally gets and keeps the lion's
share of sales.
   The FDA has been under pressure from Capitol Hill, principally
from Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., whose Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee has conducted its own probe of the
problems.
   Staff investigators have shared information with the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Baltimore, which has obtained guilty pleas from
three FDA officials, two drug companies and three drug company
executives.
   This spring, FDA began investigating 11 companies for possible
violations of federal safety and production regulations.

<HEAD>Former Top Pierce Aide Refuses to Comply with Congressional Subpoena</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce
once called his ``right hand'' is refusing to cooperate with
congressional investigators, citing his right against
self-incrimination in snubbing a subcommittee's subpoena that he
testify.
   Lance Wilson, Pierce's one-time executive assistant, told a House
subcommittee Friday that he was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights
because the conduct of panel members convinced him he would not
receive a fair hearing.
   Wilson said attacks last month by several panel members after he
failed to appear as scheduled ``made it clear that the subcommittee
members have prejudged me and have no intention of affording me a
fair and evenhanded hearing.''
   Wilson's lawyer, Raymond Banoun, lashed out at subcommittee
Chairman Thomas Lantos, other panel members and its staff, saying in
a separate letter that all had made knowingly inaccurate statements
about Wilson during televised hearings, which Banoun called a
``charade.''
   Attempts to reach Lantos, D-Calif., and subcommittee staffers
were unsuccessful.
   There was no answer at the subcommittee office when the Wilson
and Banoun letters were obtained late Friday. Lantos' home office in
San Mateo, Calif., said the Democratic congressman was on vacation
and unavailable for comment.
   Wilson was Pierce's top aide for several years and after leaving
the agency invested in several projects that received lucrative
subsidies from HUD. His successor as Pierce's executive assistant,
Deborah Gore Dean, appeared before Congress in May but refused to
answer questions, also asserting her Fifth Amendment rights.
   The subcommittee, in recess until after Labor Day, has been
investigating influence-peddling, mismanagement and fraud at HUD
during the Reagan administration.
   Testimony and other evidence indicates that former HUD officials
and prominent Republicans received special treatment from the agency
that helped them reap millions of dollars in government financing
and subsidies.
   The hearings and other sources of information also have shown
that HUD's internal controls were so poor that millions of dollars
cannot be accounted for and that the total of Reagan-era fraud might
surpass $2 billion.
   Wilson, a senior vice president at Paine Webber, had been
scheduled to appear before the subcommittee July 28 but asked for a
continuance because Banoun had to undergo emergency surgery three
days before.
   Lantos refused to grant a continuance and ordered Wilson to
appear without counsel or with another attorney. Wilson refused, but
Lantos nonetheless called him to the witness table at the hearing,
then launched into a lengthy attack on him when he failed to appear.
   Lantos said Wilson had ``joined a lucrative fraternity of former
HUD employees'' that had ``cashed in so spectacularly on moderate
rehabilitation programs.''
   Other panel members joined in criticizing Wilson, and the
committee later issued subpoenas requiring Wilson to produce myriad
records of his HUD-related dealings by Friday.
   Banoun, in the letter to Lantos, said the chairman and the
subcommittee members and staffers had ignored Wilson's right to
counsel and instead grandstanded for the television audience.
   ``You went through the charade of calling Mr. Wilson to the
witness table in front of live television cameras knowing all along
that he had courteously informed you that he would not appear,''
Banoun said in the letter.
   ``The conduct of certain members of the subcommittee and of its
staff in dealing with Mr. Wilson ... have made it abundantly clear
that they have adversely prejudged Mr. Wilson and have no intention
other than to publicly vilify him in order to achieve their own
personal motivation,'' the letter said.
   ``This fact is further buttressed by the vindictive subpoenas
issued to Mr. Wilson.''
   Banoun said the subpoenas included demands for numerous documents
the subcommittee has access to and a demand that he appear before
the panel Sept. 27 _ an appearance that would be a month later than
Wilson sought when he asked for the continuance.
   ``This raises a question as to the urgency which prompted the
denial of his initial request for a short continuance,'' Banoun's
letter said.

   Kevin Bachman was cool, calm and unflappable
during the 36 minutes that fate teamed him with a veteran pilot
trying to land a damaged DC-10 at the Sioux City, Iowa, airport last
month.
   But the 27-year-old air traffic controller who had completed his
training just three months earlier broke into tears after United
Airlines Flight 232 touched down, cartwheeled and burst into flames.
   Of the 296 people aboard the jetliner en route from Denver to
Chicago and Philadelphia, 111 were killed.
   That 185 survived is widely credited to the performance of pilot
Al C. Haynes, Bachman and rescue-response efforts on the ground.
   Listening Friday to a Federal Aviation Administration tape of his
radio interchanges with Haynes, Bachman recalled his thoughts at the
time as alternating between pessimism and optimism.
   ``Right after it happened, I had to turn away, because I didn't
think anybody would come away from it,'' Bachman said. ``And then I
went downstairs and cried.''
   While he had heard reports of some survivors, Bachman said it
wasn't until five hours after the crash _ and after he had left work
_ that he learned watching the news on television that more than
half those aboard had survived.
   ``You just try to wonder what you could have done differently,''
Bachman said. ``The first couple of days afterward, I didn't sleep
at all.''
   Later, he concluded he would not have done anything differently.
   Neither, apparently, would any of his bosses.
   ``There was not a controller there that was not doing his job,''
said Terry Dobson, FAA air traffic manager at Sioux City. ``There's
no sign that anyone failed to do their job.''
   While an investigation into the crash is continuing and officials
have yet to pinpoint its cause, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner was so satisfied with Bachman's role that he presented him
with a medal Friday for outstanding job performance.
   It was 3:23 p.m. CDT on July 19 when air traffic controllers in
Minneapolis notified Sioux City that a stricken jetliner 40 miles
away was headed for the Iowa airport.
   Three minutes later, Haynes and Bachman were having their first
conversation.
   ``OK, so you know we have almost no control ability, very little
elevator and almost no aileron,'' Haynes told Bachman. ``We are
controlling the turns by power. ... We can only turn right, but we
can't turn left.''
   Ten minutes later, the pilot, with a gasp in his voice, tells
Bachman: ``I have serious doubts about making the airport. Have you
got some place near there that we might be able to ditch? Unless we
get control of this airplane, we're going to put it down, wherever
it happens to be.''
   While FAA officials on the ground scrambled to pinpoint possible
highways where the jetliner could land, Bachman several times
directed Haynes to change his course to keep away from populated
areas.
   ``Widen out just slightly to your left ... to take you away from
the city,'' Haynes is told just eight minutes before the crash.
   ``Whatever you do, keep us away from the city,'' the pilot radios
back.
   Three minutes later, Haynes asks for possible alternatives to the
airport.
   ``We're going to have to put it down on something solid, if we
can.''
   At 3:57 p.m., Bachman says, ``Ah, United 232, if you cannot make
the airport, sir, there is an interstate that runs north to south to
the east side of the airport. It's a four-lane interstate.''
   ``We're just passing it right now,'' Haynes responds. ``We're
going to try for the airport.''
   At 3:58 p.m., Haynes to Bachman: ``Have runway in sight. We'll be
with you very shortly. Thanks a lot for your help.''
   Bachman gives Haynes figures on wind speed and direction and
tells him, ``You're cleared to land on any runway.''
   Haynes chuckles, breaking the tension for a brief moment. He
quips, ``You want to be particular, and make it a runway, huh?''
   Bachman tells Haynes about a runway on the same path as the plane
that has been closed because of lack of use.
   ``We're pretty much lined up on this one, or we think we'll be,''
Haynes says.
   At 3:59 p.m., Haynes asks Bachman for the length of the unused
runway and is told it is 6,600 feet. He's also told assembled rescue
vehicles are being cleared from it.
   ``At the end of the runway, it's just a wide open field,''
Bachman says. ``So, sir, the length won't be a problem.''
   Four seconds later, Haynes replies: ``OK''
   Eight seconds later _ at 45 seconds after 3:59 p.m. _ a ground
proximity warning horn on the plane goes off. A voice says, ``Pull
up, pull up.''
   The tape goes silent. United 232 is down.

<HEAD>Bush Says It's Premature to Consider Increasing Aid to Poland</HEAD>

   The Bush administration says it's
premature to consider increasing economic aid to Poland as the East
Bloc nation moves to install its first non-communist government in
more than 40 years.
   The traveling White House of vacationing President Bush issued a
guarded reaction Friday to news that a Solidarity activist would be
named prime minister.
   ``It's going to take a good deal of patience and determination,
persistence (for any government) to carry out an economic reform
program that will turn things around there,'' said press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as
appropriate and as we can,'' he said about the possibility of more
U.S. aid to encourage pluralistic leanings.
   ``It's really premature to think along those lines,'' Fitzwater
said, adding that U.S. budget constraints mean ``we don't have a lot
of money to offer.''
   Bush announced an aid package totaling $119 million during his
trip to Poland last month.
   The president was keeping abreast of the situation in Poland and
elsewhere while on his vacation in this resort town.
   Today, Bush was to have his speed boat, Fidelity, inspected by
the Coast Guard.
   The White House arranged a high-profile inspection, with the
president receiving a safety certificate and making remarks as a
public service announcement on boat safety.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said the administration was still waiting to
see how events unfold in Poland.
   ``It's too early at this point to know how they (Poland's
leaders) are going to make it work, let alone how it will work,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   Without delving into specific analysis of the events, Fitzwater
for the second consecutive day indicated the administration is
pleased with the general direction of events in Poland.
   On Thursday, Fitzwater had described Poland's move toward a
non-communist government as ``remarkable and history making.''
   Privately, administration officials said they were pleased that
Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski had chosen Solidarity
journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a close associate of Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, to be prime minister.
   Bush continued to vigorously enjoy his vacation, which began
Wednesday. He went boating and golfing with family members visiting
the family compound on Walker's Point.
   All of Bush's five children and his grandchildren were on hand or
were expected this weekend.
   Bush was cheery as he practiced his trademark rapid-fire golf
style, finishing 18 holes in 1 hour and 51 minutes.
   As he teed off on the first hole, Bush joked to watching
reporters:
   ``The crowd is hushed. They sense that `Mr. Smooth.' is back.''
   ``Mr. Smooth'' is a favorite name Bush uses for himself when
playing golf and horseshoes.

<HEAD>Relations on Upswing as Soviets, Cubans Loosen Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's campaign to improve
ties with Ethiopia is getting a lift from reports that some 2,000
Cuban troops are preparing to leave the African nation.
   The Soviet Union also is loosening its ties to Ethiopia, but
hundreds of Soviet advisers and East German military and security
personnel apparently will remain after the Cuban withdrawal.
   The death in an airplane crash last week of Rep. Mickey Leland, a
Texas Democrat who was a strong friend of Ethiopia in his crusade
against hunger, sparked a cooperative search that also is helping to
improve U.S. relations.
   Senior State Department officials said they wanted to see the
process accelerated. But, they said, two U.S. conditions must be met.
   Those conditions are a continuing improvement in human rights and
a serious effort by Addis Ababa to reconcile with separatists in
Ethiopia's Eritrea region and an autonomous movement in Tigray.
   But in a brief statement Friday, the State Department said it
``continues to support the territorial integrity of Ethiopia.'' That
means the United States is opposed to a separate Eritrean state.
   The prospect of Cuban troops leaving Ethiopia is also welcome
news to the administration.
   The Cubans are stationed in the Ogaden region, along the border
with Somalia. In 1978 and 1979, Ethiopia used a force of 12,000 to
17,000 Cubans along with Soviet advisers to expel troops from
Somalia.
   The remaining Cubans mostly are on sentry duty. There is no sign
that Somalia intends to become embroiled again in a conflict with
Ethiopia.
   Diplomatic sources, declining to be identified, said all the
Cubans apparently would be withdrawn.
   While Ethiopia does not receive foreign aid, it is eligible for
humanitarian assistance. During a 1988 famine, the United States
provided about $120 million _ the largest outlay to any African
country that year.
   The fact that there are about 2,000 political prisoners in
Ethiopia is considered a much larger obstacle to friendlier U.S.
relations than the governing Marxist philosophy in Addis Ababa.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic, Pacific Telesis Report Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Progress is being reported in strikes against
two regional Bell telephone companies, but union officials in New
England and Chicago are trying to turn up the financial pressure on
companies there.
   The Communications Workers of America said Friday that New
England Telephone should pay customers the money it wasn't paying
striking workers.
   The company said no, it has to pay overtime to managers filling
in for strikers and probably was losing revenue to competitors.
   Telephone operators at Illinois Bell asked customers to delay
paying their telephone bills during the strike. Chicago-based
Ameritech, which serves five Midwestern states, said using customers
in the week-long walkout was ``irresponsible.''
   Some progress was reported in talks local companies held with CWA
on Friday, a day after the union reached agreement with Bell
Atlantic. Bell of Pennsylvania was to begin talks today with the
CWA, whose members have been on strike for two weeks.
   On the West Coast, Pacific Telesis of San Francisco also reported
substantial progress toward a new contract.
   Wages and employee contributions to health-insurance plans have
been major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the four
companies' nearly 200,000 employees in 20 states and the District of
Columbia.
   The striking workers include operators, telephone installers and
repairmen, factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel.
All four companies have continued service using management
personnel, but there have been delays for installation and operator
services.
   The Bell Atlantic-CWA agreement resolved regional issues, while
leaving local issues to be decided in further talks.
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic also was bargaining separately with
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Union officials at Bell Atlantic said 41,000 striking workers
won't return to work until all local issues are resolved and the
11,000 workers represented by the IBEW settle. But both sides said a
final accord could be reached within days.
   Pacific Telesis spokesman Lou Saviano said CWA and company
negotiators made ``very substantial progress,'' but unresolved
issues remained.
   No new talks have been scheduled in the Ameritech strike.
   Five people were arrested Friday outside Ohio Bell headquarters
in Columbus after CWA members blocked building entrances. Those
arrested were issued summonses and released.
   A picketer was arrested at a Michigan Bell facility near Saginaw
after strikers blocked a driveway. The 37-year-old woman was charged
with obstructing traffic, a misdemeanor, and freed on $100 bond.
   In Vermont, where CWA and IBEW workers are striking New England
Telephone, a subsidiary of New York-based NYNEX, union officials
said the regional company stood to save $3.1 million from 1989
through 1992 if it's successful in shifting some costs of health
insurance to its employees.
   ``This money will not be translated into lower phone bills for
Vermont customers because local rates are frozen,'' said Ken Peres,
a CWA economist. ``Instead, the $3.1 million will flow directly as
profits to NYNEX's subsidiary, New England Telephone.''
   Richard Fortier, business manager of IBEW Local 2326, said union
officials also wanted rebates to Vermont phone customers ``to
reflect New England Telephone's decreased expenses on wages and
benefits during the bargaining impasse.''
   NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo said: ``We're not doing this to save
money. We're asking employees to pick up part of the health-care
costs because the costs are escalating so much we can't keep pace
ourselves.''
   Bonomo said the company was incurring increased expenses in
overtime paid to managers filling in for striking workers and
probably was losing revenues to competitors.
   In Chicago, CWA spokesman Greg Kenefick said the union wanted
telephone customers to ``put telephone bills on hold.''
   ``Our focus now is going to be biting into their income, asking
people to put bills on hold,'' Kenefick said, adding that he doesn't
believe there's much risk of customers losing service if they
withhold payment.
   Pat Montgomery, spokeswoman for Illinois Bell, called it
``irresponsible to use customers in a management-union dispute.''

   Here are excerpts from a tape of conversations
among air traffic controllers at Minneapolis and Sioux City, Iowa,
and the crew of a United Airlines DC-10 that crash-landed July 19 at
Sioux City.
   Of the 296 people aboard Flight 232, 185 survived and 111 were
killed. The tape, covering about 36 minutes of relevant
interchanges, was released Friday by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   3:23 p.m. CDT _ Minneapolis controllers to Sioux City
controllers: Sioux City, got an emergency for you.
   Sioux City: All right.
   Minneapolis: I've got a United aircraft coming in, lost No. 2
engine, having a hard time controlling the aircraft right now. He's
out of 29,000 right now and descending to Sioux City. Right now he's
east of your VOR but he wants the equipment standing by right now.
.... He's east 40 miles ....
   Sioux City: Radar contact.
   3:25 p.m. _ Minneapolis: Did you say you had a radar on United
Airlines 232?
   Sioux City: Affirmative radar.
   Minneapolis: He's having a hard time controlling the plane right
now and trying to slow down and get steady on a heading. As soon as
I get comfortable, I'll ship him over to you and he'll be in your
control.
   Sioux City: All right.
   3:26 p.m. _ UAL 232: Sioux City approach, United Airlines 232
Heavy (wide body), with you out of 26 (26,000 feet altitude).
Heading right now is 290 and we've got about a 500-foot rate of
descent. .... OK, so you know we have almost no control ability,
very little elevator and almost no aileron. We are controlling the
turns by power. ... We can only turn right, but we can't turn left.''
   Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, understand, sir, you can only make
right turns.
   3:27 p.m. _ Sioux City: United 232, ... your present track puts
you about 8 miles north of the airport, sir, and the only way we can
get you around to (runway) 31 is a slight left turn with
differential power or, if you can, jockey it over.
   UAL 232: OK, we're in a right turn now. That's about the only way
we can go. We'll be able to make very slight left turns on final,
but right now just going to make right turns to whatever heading you
want.
   3:29 p.m. _ Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, say souls on board and
fuel remaining.
   3:32 p.m. _ UAL 232: We have no hydraulic fluid, which means we
have no elevator control, almost none, and very little aileron
control. I have serious doubts about making the airport. Have you
got some place near there that we might be able to ditch? Unless we
get control of this airplane, we're going to put it down wherever it
happens to be.
   Sioux City: United 232, roger. Stand by.
   3:36 p.m. _ Sioux City: And United 232 Heavy, did you get the
souls on board count.
   UAL 232: Stand by, tell you, right now we don't even have time to
let go and call the gal ....
   Sioux City: Roger.
   UAL 232: Two hundred ninety-two souls on board United 232.
   Sioux City: Roger, thank you.
   3:43 p.m. _ UAL 232: United 232, we're going to have to continue
one more right turn. We've got the elevators pretty much under
control within 300 or 400 feet, but we still can't do much with the
steering.
   Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, roger, understand you do have the
elevators possibly under control. Will you be able to hold the
altitude?
   UAL 232: Negative. We don't have it. We are better, that's all.
   Sioux City: Roger.
   3:46 p.m. _ UAL 232: OK, United 232, we're starting a left turn
back to the airport. Since we have no hydraulics, braking is really
going to be a problem. Ah, we suggest the equipment be toward the
far end of the runway and I think under the circumstances,
regardless of the condition of the airplane, when we stop, we're
going to evacuate. So you might notify the ground crew equipment
that we're going to do that.
   Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, wilco sir, and if you can continue
that left turn to a 220 heading, sir, that will take you right to
the airport.
   3:51 p.m. _ Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, you are going to have
to widen out just slightly to your left, sir, to make the turn to
final and also to take you away from the city.
   UAL 232: Whatever you do, keep us away from the city.
   3:53 p.m. _ Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, been advised there's a
four-lane highway up in that area, sir, if you can pick that up.
   UAL 232: OK, we'll see what we can do here. We've already put the
gear down, and we're going to have to put it down on something solid
if we can.
   3:54 p.m. _ UAL 232: We've got about three or four minutes to go,
it looks like.
   Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, Roger. Can you pick up a road or
something up there?
   UAL 232: We're trying ....
   3:55 p.m. _ Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, the airport is, oh,
about 18 miles southeast of your position, about 220 on the heading.
But we're going to need you southbound away from the city first, it
you can hold a 180 heading.
   UAL 232: We're trying to get to it right now .... OK, we're 180
degrees heading, now what do you want?
   3:56 p.m. _ Sioux City: ... That heading will put you, oh,
currently 15 miles northeast of the airport. If you can hold that,
it will put you on about three-mile final.
   UAL 232: OK, we're giving it heck.
   3:57 p.m. _ Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, the airport's currently
12 o'clock and 13 miles.
   UAL: OK, we're looking for it.
   Sioux City: Ah, United 232 Heavy, if you cannot make the airport,
sir, there is an interstate that runs north to south to the east
side of the airport. It's a four-lane interstate.
   3:58 p.m. _ UAL: We're just passing it right now. We're going to
try for the airport.
   Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, roger, and advise when you get the
airport in sight.
   UAL 232: Have runway in sight. We'll be with you very shortly.
Thanks a lot for your help.
   Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, the wind is currently 360 at one
one (11 knots) .... You're cleared to land on any runway.
   UAL 232: (Laughter) You want to be particular and make it a
runway, huh?
   Sioux City: ... There is a runway that's closed, sir, that could
probably work, too. It runs northeast to southwest.
   UAL: We're pretty much lined up on this one, or we think we will
be.
   3:59 p.m. _ Sioux City: United 232 Heavy, roger sir. That closed
runway will work, sir. We're getting the equipment off the runway
and they'll line up for that one.
   UAL 232: How long is it?
   Sioux City: 6,600 feet, and the equipment is coming off.
(Thirteen seconds elapse.) At the end of the runway, it's just a
wide open field, so, sir, the length won't be a problem.
   UAL 232: OK. (Twelve seconds elapse, then a ground proximity
warning horn sounds.) Pull up, pull up. (unintelligible).

<HEAD>Government Cuts Estimate of Undiscovered Oil Resources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undiscovered U.S. oil supplies are far smaller
than estimated early in this decade, although prospects in Alaska
have brightened, the Interior Department says.
   A department report released Friday said 49 billion barrels of
crude oil outside known fields could, if found, be developed with
existing technology.
   At the current price of $18 a barrel, however, only two-thirds of
the total would be economic to produce, it said.
   In its most recent previous estimate in 1981, the department
estimated 83 billion barrels of undiscovered crude. One barrels
equals 42 gallons.
   Throughout the decade, the amount of known U.S. oil reserves has
held steady at about 30 billion barrels and production has remained
near 3 billion barrels yearly.
   Thus, the new estimate of undiscovered resources means the life
expectancy of all U.S. oil resources _ except unconventional sources
such as oil shales and tar sands _ has dropped to 26 years. The 1981
figures implied a life expectancy of 37 years.
   ``The change is significant,'' said Gary Hill, chief of the U.S.
Geological Survey's office of energy and marine biology. The survey
produced the report in collaboration with the Interior Department's
Minerals Management Service.
   A key reason for the lower estimate of undiscovered oil
resources, the report said, is the failure in recent years of
drilling prospects once thought to be promising.
   ``The massive exploration effort of industry of the late 1970s
and early 1980s simply did not confirm some of the geological
expectations,'' the report said.
   Hill said in an interview that some of the most significant
drilling disappointments were in the Overthrust Belt in the Rocky
Mountain area and off the Atlantic Coast.
   Although prospects have dimmed in some offshore Alaska areas,
that state overall has become the most promising development area
for oil in the United States, the report said.
   The report estimated 13.2 billion barrels of oil are recoverable
in Alaska, compared with a 1981 estimate of 6.9 billion barrels. The
increase is due largely to new geological data on the Alaska Coastal
Plain, the site of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Industry is
trying to persuade Congress to open the refuge to oil exploration.
   The report said the United States has an estimated 399 trillion
cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas, down from the 1981 estimate
of 594 trillion cubic feet.
   The amount of undiscovered natural gas liquids, such as butane
and propane, was cut in half, to 9 billion barrels.
   In response to the report, Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore
said new technologies, such as horizontal drilling, will
significantly increase the amount of oil and gas that eventually can
be developed.
   ``Even after considering all these factors, there clearly is a
decline,'' Moore said in a statement. ``This is all the more reason
why we must proceed with a national energy strategy to contend with
declining domestic production and increasing imports.''

<HEAD>Feds Close Four More Thrifts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are closing four more small
failed savings and loan associations.
   The thrifts in Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas bring to seven
the number closed since President Bush signed the $159 billion S&amp;L
bailout legislation Aug. 9.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. said Friday that it was closing Sioux
Valley Savings and Loan Association of Cherokee, Iowa; First Federal
Savings and Loan Association of Coffeyville, Coffeyville, Kan.;
Evangeline Federal Savings Association, Lafayette, La.; and Century
Savings and Loan Association, Baytown, Texas.
   The deposits of the Kansas, Louisiana and Texas thrifts are being
transferred to commercial banks and their offices will reopen
Monday. All depositors are protected up to the $100,000 insurance
limit.
   However, regulators could not find an institution interested in
taking over Sioux Valley's deposits. RTC Executive Director David C.
Cooke said depositors at the S&amp;L, which has $90.4 million in 12,059
accounts, will be paid off ``within a few days.''
   Bank 4 Coffeyville is taking over the Kansas thrift, which had
$86.4 million in deposits in 12,889 accounts. Hibernia National Bank
of New Orleans will operate the Louisiana S&amp;L, which had $79.3
million in 1,945 accounts. NCNB Texas National Bank, Dallas, will
acquire the Baytown deposits, $85.5 million in 6,418 accounts.
   The RTC is assuming control of the loans, real estate and other
assets of all four savings associations.
   The transactions are similar to three announced Aug. 10, when the
RTC closed institutions in Texas, Illinois and Florida.

<HEAD>Court Blocks New Cost Formula For Foreclosures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lending industry, winning a preliminary
victory in its fight with the Department of Veterans Affairs over
who will pay for a growing number of VA mortgage defaults, says the
agency's refusal to bid on foreclosed property cost the industry
$200 million last year.
   In a temporary injunction granted Friday, U.S. District Judge
George H. Revercomb said he agreed with the Mortgage Bankers
Association that VA could not use its borrowing costs from the
Treasury in determining whether to buy and hold foreclosed property
until it could be resold.
   The alternative to having VA acquire the property is for the
lender to be left with it, with the VA paying the lender the maximum
guarantee amount of $36,000.
   A hearing on a permanent injunction remains to be scheduled and
probably won't be heard for several months, the industry group said.
The new regulation had been scheduled to take effect Monday.
   The group, which represents 2,200 members of the mortgage lending
industry, said Congress had ``considered and rejected'' the interest
cost deduction when it told VA to acquire fewer foreclosed
properties.
   Revercomb said he agreed that ``the cost of funds in the net
value definition is a clear violation of the controlling federal
statute'' enacted in 1984 to help control the deficit.
   Congress required VA to calculate the net worth of property by
taking its fair market value _ the price it would command in the
present real estate market _ and subtracting a variety of costs. The
VA would not repurchase homes that it would have to sell at a loss.
   Under the veterans' loan program, the VA guarantees to the
mortgage lender that it will pay 40 percent or 50 percent of the
mortgage debt if the borrower defaults, up to the maximum.
   Until Congress acted, VA bought the foreclosed property in nearly
every case, ``even when it did not make financial sense to do so,''
Revercomb said.
   Neither VA nor the Justice Department would comment immediately
on the ruling.
   Foreclosures on VA-backed loans have risen sharply in recent
years, due largely to the real estate slump in Texas and Oklahoma.
   The Government National Mortgage Association, an arm of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, says six lenders that
had financial problems linked to the so-called ``no-bids'' defaulted
in 1988.
   President Bush's budget message this year estimated the new
regulation would result in 10 percent fewer property acquisitions.
The industry group says its average loss on a piece of property VA
does not acquire is more than $18,000.
   A July General Accounting Office report said foreclosures rose
from 13,729 in fiscal 1981 to 43,316 in 1987. In those same two
years, VA annual losses rose from $51 million to $615 million, GAO
said.
   The report by GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, supported
the idea of including the interest costs.

<HEAD>USDA Raises Estimate of Farmers' Net Cash Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says farmers' 1989
net cash income will be $2 billion more than anticipated a month
ago, but the forecast is still short of last year's record.
   The latest monthly estimate by the department's Economic Research
Service, released Friday, says net cash income is expected to be in
the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with $50 billion
to $55 billion predicted in July.
   Last year, because of rising commodity prices because of the
drought-shriveled harvest, net cash income was a record $59.9
billion. That figure was also revised upward from last month's
estimate of $58 billion for 1988 income.
   Net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the
year and represents the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses. For example, 1988 sales of grain stored from harvests
in earlier years were counted as part of the 1988 gross.
   Another method of USDA bookkeeping measures ``net farm income''
for the calendar year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out system
involved in ``net cash income.''
   By this alternate method, changes in the value of farm
inventories are taken into consideration and allowances are made for
``non-money'' items such as depreciation, the family consumption of
farm-grown foods and the net rental value of dwellings.
   Net farm income in 1989 was forecast at $48 billion to $53
billion, up $1 billion from projections in July. In 1988, net farm
income was reported at $45.7 billion, which was revised up from $44
billion a month ago.
   One reason for net cash income being down from the record 1988
level is that farmers have put more land back into production this
year, meaning larger expenses for field preparation, weed control
and harvesting. Also, government payments to farmers are down
sharply this year.
   ``Forecasters are divided on whether the U.S. economy is headed
for a brief slowdown or a downturn,'' the report said. ``Agriculture
is likely to find the general economy mildly supportive in either
case. Lower interest rates and perhaps lower exchange rates, common
to both outlooks, would reduce farm costs and boost agricultural
exports.''
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 5 percent to 7 percent,
on average, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1988. Most of the
expected increase took place in the first half of 1989, the report
said.
   The agency said wheat and rice prices are likely to rise,
although overall grain and soybean production ``will increase
markedly'' from 1988, despite a heavy toll from poor weather.

<HEAD>Dean Tells Protesters `I've Been Made Such a Scapegoat'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deborah Gore Dean, a central figure in the
investigation into the scandal-plagued Department of Housing and
Urban Development who was summoned to her doorstep by a group of
protesters, says if she did something wrong she'll try to make it
right.
   The protesters who gathered Friday morning in front of Dean's
town house in Georgetown accomplished something Congress has been
unable to do _ get Dean to talk about the influence-peddling scandal.
   ``If I've done something wrong, I'm completely willing to try to
make it right,'' said the one-time executive assistant to former HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   About 20 people gathered outside Dean's home, and one shouted:
``We want to talk to you about HUD.''
   ``Thanks, but no thanks,'' said Dean, who took the Fifth
Amendment against self-incrimination when called before a
congressional panel investigating HUD.
   ``I've had enough,'' she said.
   ``So have we,'' shouted members of the group mobilized by the
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, ACORN.
   So, barefoot and wearing jeans and blouse turned inside out, Dean
came to the doorstep and spoke politely with her unexpected
visitors. She repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
   ``I don't have a single personal friend who ever got something
from HUD,'' she said, referring to reports that she approved HUD
loans to unworthy projects pushed by well-connected Republicans.
   ``I liked Sam Pierce. He was a good person ... but I think there
might have been people there who have done things they are trying to
hide.''
   One person asked about a program to subsidize rehabilitation of
housing for people with moderate incomes. Dean responded that the
money ``all went to low and moderate housing except for a couple of
cases.''
   The group alerted a Washington Post reporter, who was present for
the confrontation.
   The group was led by Alberta Shields, who lives in a public
housing project in Washington.
   ``We are the people who live in the low-income neighborhoods that
suffered as you gave precious HUD resources away to your friends,''
Shields read from a letter.
   ``Can you lend us some money? We need to fix up those abandoned
houses in our neighborhoods so we can get rid of the crack dealers
you have allowed to move in.''
   Dean nodded, ``OK, OK, I don't blame you.''
   She later pleaded with the crowd, ``I really loved my years at
HUD. I spent all my time on Fair Housing. But you wouldn't know that
from the press ... I'm really, really, really sorry. I wish you knew
me and what I tried to do at HUD. ...
   ``I've been made such a scapegoat. This is what I wanted to do
the rest of my life,'' she said. ``And when I walk into HUD now,
people turn the other way.''

<TEXT>
   A gunman assassinated a leading
presidential hopeful at a political rally Friday night, the mayor of
Bogota said. It was the latest in a series of attacks by drug
traffickers, police said.
   The assassin opened fire on Sen. Luis Carlos Galan as the Liberal
Party candidate was about to give a speech before 10,000 people in
Soacha, 20 miles south of Bogota. At least 10 others were wounded.
   After the attack President Virgilio Barco used his powers under
the nation's state of siege to re-establish a treaty with the United
States to extradite suspected drug traffickers.
   Galan, 46, died of several gunshot wounds to the chest, said
Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana. Galan had escaped an assassination
attempt Aug. 5 in the city of Medillin by drug traffickers, who
police said had offered $500,000 to kill him.
   Police also blamed the Friday attack on drug lords.
   Galan, who had been one of six Liberal Party candidates seeking
the presidential party's nomination for the May 1990 president, was
widely considered the front-runner to replace Barco.
   Photographer Jesus Calderon said two shots hit Galan in the
stomach as he was about to give his speech at the rally.
   ``When the individual began firing, (Galan) fell to the ground,''
said photographer Jesus Calderon. Calderon said two shots hit Galan
in the stomach, but he maintained consciousness ``and asked only
that he be taken quickly to the hospital.''
   At least 10 others were wounded, including one of Galan's
bodyguards, two local political leaders and supporters near the
podium. The crowd panicked.
   ``The people were running, screaming and crying,'' said Calderon.
   The gunman escaped, and police mounted a search.
   Barco, in an address broadcast nationwide on television and
radio, said he would renew the extradition treaty with the United
States, which was suspended by the Supreme Court on a technicality
in April 1988.
   He said his government would take emergency measures to stop the
Medellin cartel, which is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine
that reaches the United States. They include hiring special judges
to investigate drug traffickers and detaining suspects for a week
without a hearing.
   The attack came hours after drug traffickers shot to death a
provincial police chief who had led a campaign against the drug
traffickers based in Medellin.
   The Medellin cartel claimed responsibility for the slaying of
Col. Waldemar Franklin Quintero in calls to local radio stations.
   Friday's attacks came amid a strike by the nation's judges, who
are protesting the violence and they say is a lack of protection for
members of their profession.
   Franklin Quintero recently had given up his official bodyguards
and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges.
   Franklin Quintero, 46, police commander for Antioquia province
where Medellin is located, left his home Friday in his
chauffeur-driven car that had gone about 450 feet when it was cut
off by another car and five gunmen emerged, officials said.
   ``They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel,
who was hit more than a hundred times,'' an unidentified witness
told Radio Caracol. The witness said the chauffeur also was injured.
   Witnesses said Franklin Quintero's car was destroyed by gunfire.
The interior was covered with blood.
   Franklin Quintero directed the local campaign against cocaine
trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure
of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers.
   On Wednesday night, Magistrate Carlos Valencia Garcia was shot to
death in Bogota, hours after rejecting appeals filed on behalf of
two Medellin leaders.
   On Thursday night, an armed band intercepted a police van
carrying 18 arrested people and set them free. They included several
suspected drug traffickers, officials said.
   ``It's terrifying what is happening in Colombia,'' said Justice
Minister Monica de Grieff.
   ``The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting
together, the government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry
to stop the wave of violence,'' she said.

   Lawmakers are fuming over the placement and
timing of a warning about the dangers of smoking in the latest James
Bond movie, ``Licence to Kill.''
   Philip Morris paid $350,000 to the film maker, United Artists, to
have its Lark cigarette appear in the movie, according to
congressional testimony.
   In response to concerns from the American Lung Association,
American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the movie
contains the Surgeon General's warning about the effect of smoking.
   Reps. Tom Luken, D-Ohio, and Bob Whittaker, R-Kan., have
expressed reservations about the placement of the warning, which
comes during the final credits.
   ``We believe that the health warning should appear at the
beginning of the film, as many viewers ... will leave before they
see a warning in the movie's credits,'' Luken and Whittaker said in
a letter to the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Janet D.
Steiger.
   Luken said Friday the letter asks whether the commission has the
authority to issue rules on tobacco advertising in movies.
   Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
transportation and hazardous materials, and Whittaker, the panel's
ranking Republican, are co-sponsors of a bill that prohibits all
tobacco ads and promotion that can be seen or heard by people under
the age of 18.

<NOTE>EPA Says Lyme Disease Fear Prompts Misuse of Sprays</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says the
fear of catching Lyme disease from tick bites is causing people to
use insect repellents in potentially harmful ways.
   The EPA, which regulates the pesticides used in insect
repellents, said Friday that misuse of repellents could result in
adverse skin reactions, headaches, mood changes and possibly
convulsions or unconsciousness.
   Only a ``small number'' of reports of ill effects have been
received, but they have prompted ``concern that fear of Lyme disease
or the use of repellents for other biting pests may result in misuse
or overuse of these products,'' the agency said.
   Cynthia Georgeson, a spokeswoman for S.C. Johnson Wax,
manufacturer of the insect repellent ``Off,'' said the company
endorsed the EPA advisory because ``it's very important to have
people continue to use these products properly.''
   Among the suggestions from the EPA are:
   _Apply repellents only to exposed skin and not under clothing.
   _Never use repellents over cuts, wounds or irritated skin.
   _Take care to keep repellents away from the eyes and mouth or the
hands of small children.
   _Avoid frequent reapplication or saturation of the skin. One
application is good for four to six hours, depending on strength,
says Ms. Georgeson.
   _After returning indoors, wash repellent-treated skin with soap
and water, especially if repellents have been used repeatedly during
the day.

<NOTE>USDA Expands Ban of Ostrich Imports</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is expanding its
recent ban on ostrich imports to include emus, rheas and cassowaries
because they may carry disease-bearing parasites.
   Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Friday that the expanded
import ban was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely.
   The flightless birds affected are known as ratites and include
ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries.
   Agency spokeswoman Marlene Stinson said the ban did not apply to
penguins because those are of a different family. Neither will the
ban affect kiwis, because the bird's homeland, New Zealand, does not
permit exports, she said.
   Slagle said the crackdown on imports was prompted by the
discovery earlier this year of 18 exotic ticks on adult ostriches in
Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas.
   The ticks were identified as African Bont and Bont-legged ticks,
which are known to transmit heartwater, an often fatal disease of
cattle, sheep, goats and other ruminants. No further tick findings
have been reported.
   Slagle said the disease doesn't affect humans and doesn't exist
in the United States.

   The National Park Service is negotiating with
the Soviet Union to establish a park spanning the Bering Strait,
according to a report published today.
   Park officials will visit Siberian areas across the strait from
Alaska next month and return with Soviet officials who will inspect
Alaskan sites, The Washington Post reported.
   The service already administers the Bering Land Bridge National
Preserve, a 2.7-million acre wild area just north of Nome. There is
no comparable preserve on the Soviet side.
   Such a park could make it easier for scientists to conduct
research on both sides of the border and make it easier for wildlife
biologists to track migratory species such as walrus moving between
the two countries.
   In the last Ice Age, the strait was dry, which permitted people
and animals to move between Asia and North America.

   Tadeusz Mazowiecki may not be a household
name, but the idea of the Solidarity newspaper editor running the
government drew positive responses from Poles desperate for economic
change.
   ``I think he's a pretty wise man. But he takes the post in tough
times, so it's hard to be an optimist,'' said a transport company
clerk.
   On Friday, Mazowiecki declared that he was ready to accept
President Wojciech Jaruzelski's offer to nominate him as prime
minister and end the Communist Party's 45-year hold on government
leadership.
   A formal announcement was expected today.
   If chosen, Mazowiecki's first task should be to put a halt to
Poland's rising three-digit inflation, said the clerk, who added
that he earns $74 a month. ``Inflation causes pessimism among people
and they are terrified by what is going on,'' he said Friday.
   A group of young people sitting in front of a department store on
a balmy summer night seemed less sure of the future.
   ``A Solidarity government will surely change something, but it is
not clear in what direction,'' said a 16-year-old high school
student.
   Asked what they thought of Mazowiecki, one of Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa's closest advisers, one replied: ``It's the first time I
have heard his name.
   The group seemed to prefer Walesa.
   ``Walesa is a person who can get something from the West on
financial and political matters,'' said one student.
   Last week, Walesa said he was ready to offer himself as a
candidate for prime minister, but later said he would rather remain
with the working masses.
   Outside a bank, independent dealers speculated on politics.
   ``A Solidarity prime minister is the only way out. It's the only
thing that can gain real social support,'' said one dealer,
clutching a thick wad of zlotys, Poland's currency.
   ``If that doesn't work, then it's going to be bloody here,''
chimed in another dealer in front of the PKO Bank in central Warsaw.
   ``He (Mazowiecki) is a wise person and he knows what he wants,''
added a third dealer. ``He served a prison term. The country is an
absolute pit. There is no other way out.''
   However, he seemed skeptical about the prospects of democracy in
Poland if the Communists are allowed to hang on to the defense and
interior ministries.
   ``(Those ministries) should also be in the hands of Solidarity if
anything is going to change. They could be under civilian control
like in other countries,'' he said.
   Mazowiecki seemed to appeal as a prime minister to hurried
shoppers and early evening strollers in a busy commercial area of
downtown Warsaw. But some were too weary from the daily battle to
make ends meet to care.
   ``We're so tired, it really doesn't matter what happens,'' said a
21-year old teacher.
   Some thought the Communist Party would be reluctant to relinquish
power.
   ``It seems to me the party won't allow everything to be taken
away. They have been here too long and they are too deep into
this,'' said an employee of a private company.
   One thing was sure. A Solidarity prime minister was a new thing
and that aroused curiosity even among those with almost no interest
in politics.
   ``There has to be something new, something people can believe
in,'' said the head of a private tourist agency who had just
returned from Soviet Armenia.

   In a nation plagued by chronic shortages,
it was not surprising that the car used by the man expected to be
the next prime minister ran out of gas.
   After meeting Friday with Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who appeared prepared to nominate him for prime
minister, Solidarity editor Tadeusz Mazowiecki drove to see Roman
Catholic Primate Jozef Glemp.
   On the way back from the meeting, his car _ a Polonez belonging
to the weekly newspaper that Mazowiecki edits _ ran out of gas,
briefly stranding him and his driver until he borrowed another car.
   When asked by reporters about the difficulties he would face by
becoming the prime minister in economically troubled Poland,
Mazowiecki replied: ``My biggest problem, if I may joke, is that I
ran out of gas.''
   ``For the premier-to-be, it is not very proper,'' he said.
   Long gasoline lines in Poland make it difficult to fill up in a
hurry.
   By the time he reached the parliament building for a meeting with
other leaders in the independent Solidarity movement, not
surprisingly, Mazowiecki was feeling the pressure.
   Asked who he would have in his government, he said: ``I have to
think for a while. There is no time, but still I need some time.''
   As TV cameras turned away, Mazowiecki seemed relieved.
   ``Oh finally, I can have a smoke,'' he said.

<HEAD>Maquiladora Strike Ends In Border City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-week-old labor dispute ended Friday
after the governor of Tamaulipas state negotiated an agreement
between rival union factions, the director of a business
organization said.
   The resolution means the northeastern state of Tamaulipas will
have its first major labor union independent of the powerful Mexican
Labor Federation.
   ``The (strike) flags are coming down right at this moment,'' Mike
Allen, executive director of the McAllen Economic Development Corp.,
said Friday afternoon. McAllen, Texas, is across the Rio Grande from
Reynosa.
   Allen offered no details on the agreement, other than to call it
a victory for the head of a local union, Abel Hernandez, who had
pulled his union out of the powerful Mexican Labor Federation.
   According to the governor's spokesman, Manuel Save, the new union
will be an affiliate of the federation but will be free to choose
its own leaders and set its own policy. Business leaders said
earlier Friday that the union was to be independent.
   Talks on forming a new union are scheduled to begin next week.
   The strike pitted Hernandez against local federation leader
Rafael Morales, who called the strike on July 25 and said he took
over Hernandez's local. The labor board, controlled by the
federation, then authorized Morales as union leader.
   The strike closed 15 plants, idled 2,000 workers and cost the
plants about $500,000 a day in lost production.
   At least 800 workers of the 2,000 affected by the strike rebelled
against Morales on Tuesday, ripping down the strike flags, returning
to work and locking themselves inside their plants.
   Plant managers had refused to sign contracts with Morales, whom
they accuse of corruption. At least two plants threatened to pull
out of Mexico.
   Tamaulipas Gov. Americo Villareal met with plant managers, rival
union factions and business leaders Thursday and Friday before
resolving the stalemate.
   ``The governor of the state of Tamaulipas deserves a lot of
credit,'' Allen said in a telephone interview. ``He said enough of
this corruption. He took a very positive stand and negotiated this.''
   Villareal could not be reached for comment late Friday.
   The Mexican Labor Federation is the nation's largest and
most-powerful labor organization and is a pillar of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   The foreign-owned border plants, known as maquiladoras, take
advantage of Mexico's lower labor costs to assemble products for
export to the United States. The maquiladora industry is a key
source of jobs and investment for Mexico.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish immigrants celebrated the news that a
Solidarity activist had been named prime minister, but like their
compatriots back home were wary of the intentions of the Polish
communist authorities.
   ``From what we know of the communists, they don't give up power
without a struggle,'' said Marian Prusek, who owns a travel agency
in the Polish community on Chicago's northwest side. ``But now we
need to know what form that struggle will take _ will it be in the
parliament?''
   Capping a season of dramatic change in Poland, journalist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki said Friday that President Wojciech Jaruzelski had chosen
him to lead the Eastern bloc's first non-communist government.
   Chicago Alderman Roman Pucinski said the announcement, by the man
who led the martial law crackdown on Solidarity 8{ years ago,
indicates the determination of the Polish people to have democracy.
   ``They have a one thousand year history of fighting for human
rights and human dignity and freedom,'' said Pucinski, a leading
figure in Chicago's Polish-American community. ``And so the eight
years that have elapsed were but a slight interval in Poland's
continuing struggle for freedom.''
   Polish nationals in Chicago; Washington, D.C.; Hamtramck, Mich.,
and New York cast absentee ballots in the June parliamentary
elections, the first in the Soviet bloc since just after World War
II in which voters could select non-Communist candidates.
   Of the 5,000 people who voted at the Polish Consulate in Chicago,
which has the largest Polish community outside of Poland, 95 percent
supported candidates backed by the Solidarity free trade union.
   Poles interviewed Friday expressed surprise at the rapid pace of
change in their homeland. At this time last year Solidarity was
illegal.
   ``The changes in Poland have come around so fast that no one
could have predicted one year ago, or even six months ago, that it
would come to pass,'' said Kazimierz Olejarczyk, vice president of
the Polish-American Congress in Hamtramck.
   Mazowiecki, a Catholic activist and journalist who spent time in
jail for his anti-government activities, will have to convince Poles
to make huge sacrifices in coming months if he wants to succeed and
get Poland's economy back on track, said Mira Puacz, owner of a
Polish-language bookstore in Chicago.
   Wlodzimierz Dziubek, who moved to Chicago from Warsaw four years
ago, said he feared things in Poland would get worse.
   ``It'll be a repeat of '80 and '81,'' Dziubek said, referring to
the imposition of martial law in December 1981 that ended a 16-month
period after its creation in which Solidarity flourished.
   Dziubek, noting Poland's sad history of failed reforms, said he
would not go home.
   ``How many times have they said in Poland that they'll change and
there'll be democratization? '56, '70, '80 _ this is the fourth
time.''
   While some people expressed fear of the Soviet Union's reaction
to a non-communist government in Poland, Pucinski said Soviet
intervention is unlikely.
   ``The winds of change are just too strong,'' Pucinski said. ``I
think it's too late. It's too late for the Soviet Union to react in
any forceful way.''
   Considering the dire state of the Polish economy, the communists
may have no choice but to give Solidarity a chance to put things
right, Ms. Puacz said.
   ``Poland is devastated economically,'' she said. ``If they want
to get out of the crisis, they need some kind of change.''

   A chartered Korean Air jetliner landed
in China today, marking the first flight by a South Korean airliner
between the countries, which have no diplomatic relations.
   The KAL Boeing 727, carrying 134 tourists and 55 athletes and
sports officials, landed at Shanghai about two hours after it
departed Seoul, airline officials said.
   The South Korean athletes on board were handball players who were
to take part in the Asian championships, scheduled to open in
Beijing on Sunday. They were to fly on to Beijing on a domestic
Chinese flight, the airline officials said.
   Despite the lack of diplomatic relations, China, closely allied
with communist North Korea, has expanded non-political contacts with
South Korea in recent years.
   China sent its first commercial flights to Seoul last year during
the Summer Olympics.
   KAL officials said they are negotiating for at least one

<HEAD>Teen-Age Gunman Bursts into Pediatric Ward to Free Convict Companions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police are searching for three teen-age
convicts after an 18-year-old gunman burst into the crowded
pediatric ward of a city hospital and freed two companions.
   The gunman, an escapee from the Oak Hill Detention Center, waved
a .357 magnum handgun and told doctors and patients at D.C. General
Hospital Thursday afternoon that he would shoot unless the two teens
were freed, witnesses and police said.
   ``He just came in out of nowhere with the gun and pointed at the
two young men in chains and said, `You let them go or I'm going to
start shooting,''' said a pediatrician who asked not to be
identified. ``It was extremely dangerous. Nothing like this has ever
happened here before.''
   As the gunman, identified by police as Samuel Hilliard,
threatened to open fire, some mothers ``just scooped up their
children and left,'' said one witness, while others ducked for cover
or sat terrified in their seats until the trio fled. No shots were
fired and no one was injured.
   The two youths had been taken to the hospital for medical
treatment, but officials did not reveal their specific complaints.
   Hilliard had been serving time at Oak Hill since March 1987 for
armed robbery and homicide, sources said. He escaped in late July
after being sent to D.C. General for treatment of an illness that
authorities believe was faked.
   The youths who fled the hospital with Hilliard were identified as
Lamar Jenkins, 18, who was incarcerated at Oak Hill in July for an
assault with a dangerous weapon conviction, and Steven Jones, 16,
who had been held since March for first-degree murder while armed.
   Police sources said Jenkins was a member of a major city cocaine
ring broken up last spring, which police believe is responsible for
up to 30 slayings.
   The Oak Hill facility, operated by the District of Columbia
Corrections Department, is located in suburban Laurel, Md.

   Two-thirds of the developing world's infants have
been immunized against polio in a drive to eradicate the crippling
disease by the year 2000, the World Health Organization said.
   In India, 63 percent of infants have received the required three
doses of oral polio vaccine before their first birthday, according
to an agency survey released Friday. China, which has mounted a
major vaccination campaign in recent years, reported 96 percent
coverage.
   The two countries have the world's largest numbers of children
ages 1 or younger.
   WHO last year set a goal of wiping out polio by the year 2000.
There are about 250,000 cases and 25,0000 related deaths each year,
the vast majority in the Third World.
   Other developing countries listing 80 percent or more of their
infants immunized included Tanzania, Egypt, Brazil, Iran, South
Korea, Colombia and Mexico. The lowest coverage, 16 percent, was
reported by two of the poorest countries, Bangladesh and Ethiopia.
   The survey said immunization has reached 66 percent of all
infants in developing countries. Coverage in industrialized
countries is 88 percent, but this excludes the United States and
Australia, which do not report immunization coverage for children
under 1 year, WHO said.

<HEAD>Calls to AIDS Hot Lines Up Following AZT News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH NEFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calls to AIDS hot lines in New York and San
Francisco increased following reports that the drug AZT can delay
the deadly disease's onset, as callers also sought information about
testing for the virus.
   New York City's hot line had a 25 percent jump in calls Friday,
said its director, Don Troise.
   The Gay Men's Health Crisis Inc. added an extra counselor to its
hot line to handle the increased load of calls; most of those who
called were asking where they could be tested rather than about AZT,
said Bruce Patterson, director of that hot line.
   ``This new AZT story has tipped the scales for people who hadn't
decided yet whether to get tested,'' Patterson said.
   On Thursday, Dr. Louis Sullivan, the federal health and human
services secretary, announced that AZT, azidothymidine, has proven
effective in halting the progression of AIDS in people infected with
the HIV virus but who have shown no symptoms.
   Sullivan characterized the findings as the turning point in the
battle to change acquired immune deficiency syndrome from a fatal
disease to a treatable one.
   In San Francisco, organizations reported more questions about the
availability of AZT than about testing.
   The San Francisco AIDS Foundation Hotline and the hot line for
Project Inform both reported a moderate but steady increase in calls
Friday.
   An operator for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation described the
more hopeful environment: ``Previously, people might say, `Why be
tested? So I can know I'm going to die?' Now we can tell them
there's a reason.''
   A study among homosexual or bisexual males _ the largest risk
group _ suggests that up to 99 percent of those infected will
eventually develop the disease. Both San Francisco and New York have
significant homosexual populations.
   ``There has been a modest increase in interest from people for
procuring AZT, and we expect that to be pretty steady over the next
several weeks,'' said Steve Petrow, a spokesman for the San
Francisco AIDS Foundation, the region's largest AIDS organization.
``The news from the government was sort of blunted in San Francisco
by the fact this has sort (of) been known for some time to just
about everybody involved.''
   Still, Sonna Craig, spokeswoman for the University of California
at San Francisco General Hospital, where the school operates an AIDS
Activities Ward, Friday reported no discernible increase in the
number of people seeking AZT treatment.
   She suspects that many HIV-infected people in San Francisco had
already decided whether they should be taking AZT, citing extensive
media coverage of the drug over the last six months.
   With health experts now saying it is crucial for people at risk
of contracting AIDS to be tested for HIV and receive AZT if it can
help them, the news also raised questions about how to promote
widespread voluntary testing and who will pay for the drug treatment.
   A large number of AIDS patients don't have health insurance and
are ineligible for the government's Medicare or Medicaid benefits.
   Patients spend $3,000 to $8,000 a year for the drug, depending on
the dosage.
   ``The major task that lies before us now is to make sure that
this and other preventative treatments are made available to all who
need them,'' said Project Inform in a statement. ``To this end, we
urge an immediate reduction in the price of AZT in light of the
greatly increased market that this news creates.''
   AZT is made by Burroughs Wellcome Co. Shares of the firm's
parent, Wellcome PLC, rose 32 percent Friday on the London Stock
Exchange on news of the U.S. government's study, closing at $10.53.
   The drug, developed jointly by government researchers and
Burroughs Wellcome, is the only one licensed for AIDS treatment. The
company estimates more than 20,000 people are paying for AZT and
another 7,000 are getting it free in clinical trials.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system and renders it incapable of
protecting against infection. The disease is caused by the HIV virus
and is spread most frequently through sexual contact, the sharing of
needles and syringes, and from mother to newborn infant.
   New figures released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control
show there have been 102,621 cases of AIDS diagnosed in the United
States since 1981. A total of 59,391 U.S. patients have died.

   A Trans World Airlines MD-80 landed safely after
an engine came apart and spewed out a metal piece that smashed
through the roof of an auto body shop, narrowly missing the manager.
   Flight 223 bound from St. Louis to San Francisco returned to
Lambert Airport less than 15 minutes after taking off Friday morning.
   Airline officials said it was too early to tell what caused the
Pratt &amp; Whitney engine to lose its rear cover. TWA spokesman Don
Morrison said the engine was designed to eject loose parts out the
back to minimize damage if problems arose.
   ``I heard a large explosion, and then I heard a lot of debris
hitting the roof,'' said Mark Erp, 29, the manager of the North
County Auto Body &amp; Used Car Sales shop, about 1{ miles from the
airport. ``A big hunk came through the roof and hit the floor about
10 or 15 feet frm me. I just dived away.
   ``I had been walking that way. If I walked faster, I would have
gotten nailed.''
   Morrison said the 112 passengers on board were put on a flight
for Los Angeles, where they would make connections for San Francisco.
   Fred Farrar, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in
Washington, said the plane could have been flown safely without the
cowling but that the pilot probably did the right thing by aborting
the flight.
   ``Given the fact that we have 19,000 flights per day in this
country, we may have one report like this a month,'' Farrar said.
   A shower of metal was scattered across the roof of the body shop
and along a street near the shop.
   No injuries were reported, and Morrison said the plane made a
routine landing.
   Erp said the cone, about 2 feet long and weighing about 15
pounds, tore a 5-foot square hole in the shop's roof.
   He said TWA officials who reclaimed the debris were at the shop
only briefly. ``They just took the cone and picked up some smaller
pieces and left,'' Erp said. ``They didn't say a whole lot. I guess
they didn't want to talk about it.''
   It was the second emergency landing without incident this week at
Lambert. On Tuesday, a United Air Lines Boeing 737 made a safe
landing after its pilot reported that cockpit lights indicated one
landing gear failed to lock into place. Officials said it was a
false alarm.

   West Germany said it will provide $1
million worth of equipment for next year's elections, and that it is
prepared to resume economic aid to Nicaragua if the balloting is
free and fair.
   West Germany, a U.S. ally, cut off financial aid to the leftist
Sandinista government in 1982, accusing it of being undemocratic.
   ``I return to my country with the impression that things have
changed much in the last few months,'' West German Deputy Foreign
Minister Helmut Schiffer said Friday during a visit to Managua.
   He said his country has granted a request from Nicaragua's
Supreme Electoral Council to provide computers, technical material
and election supplies for the balloting in February.
   ``If elections are free ... then there will be no reason to
reject helping this country economically,'' Schaffer said.
   He spoke in German through an interpreter with reporters at the
foreign correspondents club.
   Schaffer said his government and the rest of the European
Economic Community will closely watch the elections to see if the
Sandinistas follow through on their promises of democratization.
   Schaffer's 11-day trip in the region has taken him to Cuba,

   Discovery of a magnetic field around
Neptune suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but
NASA hopes they won't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies
past the planet.
   ``Right now I don't think anyone is terribly alarmed,'' said Norm
Haynes, Voyager project manager at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Similar radiation belts at Jupiter disrupted Voyager's internal
clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the
wrong time.
   Today, Voyager was 2.74 billion miles from Earth and 5.01 million
miles from Neptune, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,251
mph.
   The ship will make its closest approach to Neptune at 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday when it zooms about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of
the solar system's fourth-largest planet. The spacecraft was
launched in 1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and
Uranus in 1986.
   NASA announced Friday that Voyager 2 detected intense, pulselike
radio signals coming from Neptune _ strong evidence the planet has a
magnetic field. Radio waves are generated when high-speed
electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere
along magnetic field lines.
   Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus have magnetic fields.
Venus and Mars do not. Whether Pluto has one is unknown, NASA said.
   Magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a
planet's core. Molten iron in Earth's core, for example, creates a
magnetic field that traps charged particles in the Van Allen belts.
   Although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a
nuclear reactor, such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft
electronics.
   So far at Neptune, ``there's nothing to indicate it (the
radiation) is anything worse than we expected,'' said Haynes. ``But
time will tell.''
   Existence of Neptune's magnetic field suggests the planet has an
aurora like Earth's northern and southern lights, created when
charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a
planet's poles.
   Further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists
determine the exact length of a day on Neptune _ now believed to be
between 17 and 18 Earth hours _ and gain better understanding of
Neptune's internal structure, said Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spokeswoman Mary Beth Murrill.
   Voyager project scientist Edward Stone has said he believes
Neptune's hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a
superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center.
   That would mean that Neptune, like neighboring Uranus, probably
lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea.
   Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic
field bombards that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in
color. Neptune's magnetic field may cause similar radiation
darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, NASA said.
   NASA on Friday also released new photographs taken by Voyager.
Blurry black-and-white images show markings on Triton, Neptune's
largest moon, but ``it is still too early to tell if the features
are clouds or features on Triton's surface,'' NASA said.
   A color photo of Neptune shows complex, frequently changing
weather patterns in its atmosphere, including high-altitude wispy
clouds, a small cloud dubbed ``the scooter'' because it rotates
quickly, and other clouds that appear as long streaks.
   In recent weeks, Voyager also has discovered four Neptunian moons
besides two observed from Earth; two partial rings, or ring arcs, of
debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet
streams on Earth.

   Three men armed with assault rifles killed one
armored car guard and critically injured another in a botched holdup
at a shopping center, police said.
   The gunmen, who failed to get any money in the robbery attempt
Friday, abandoned their car in a nearby wooded area and were still
at large, said police, who were searching for them with helicopters
and bloodhounds.
   The guards had just finished making a delivery to the Long Island
Savings Bank in the Queens borough of New York when they were
confronted at 11:20 a.m. by the thieves, said police spokesman
Joseph McConville.
   The guards from Coin Devices Corp. exchanged fire with the
gunmen, and a 26-year-old guard was shot in the head and killed. The
other guard was hospitalized with wounds in the chest, arm and
groin, McConville said.
   A third security guard, who was inside the armored van when the
gunbattle occurred, was not injured.
   Investigators found two Uzi submachine guns, a 9mm rifle, a
.357-caliber revolver and a 12-gauge shotgun in the abandoned car,
which was riddled with bullet holes.

   In the spirit of the concert it's
commemorating, an unofficial Woodstock reunion is slowly coming
together with borrowed gear and donated services.
   By late Friday night cars were lining all the roads leading to
the farm where 400,000 people spent three days _ Aug. 15-17, 1969 _
listening to music, getting high and enduring shortages of food,
water and hygienic outlets.
   Unlike the original Woodstock concert, no rock stars were within
miles, but thousands of people were still pouring onto the site
regarded as sacred ground to those nostalgic for the rock culture of
the 1960s.
   Police estimate this weekend's gathering will attract up to
100,000 people, and by Friday some 35,000 had descended on the
49-acre farm 60 miles north of New York City, said Sgt. Charles
Kulick of the Sullivan County Sheriff's Department.
   Most people were willing to pay a $5 ``donation'' to gain
entrance to the farm, although there was no guarantee of
entertainment. By Friday evening local musicians were performing on
a makeshift stage using donated sound equipment powered by a donated
generator.
   ``We had no idea it would grow into this,'' said Richard Pell, as
he stood on the stage and gestured toward the crowd spread about the
sloping field.
   Pell, the unofficial coordinator of the unofficial event, said
the project started earlier in the week with a handful of guitarists
playing for a few dozen people.
   A three-day reunion concert, held 12 miles away at the Imperial
Resort in Swan Lake, flopped Thursday when only 250 people showed up
to hear performers like Edgar Winter and Woodstock veteran John
Sebastian. Bruce Taylor, the vice president of the Imperial Hotel,
offered to move Friday night's concert to the Woodstock field, but
Bethel city officials wouldn't allow it.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' said town supervisor Allan Scott.
``There's enough frenzy here already.''
   Authorities had made one drug arrest by Friday night and two
people were hospitalized, one for a drug overdose and another for
acute alchoholism.
   The urge to celebrate history's most famous rock 'n' roll concert
at its actual site and not at a Catskill Mountain resort drew a
cross-section of American culture: hippies and ex-hippies, bikers,
legions of Grateful Dead followers known as Dead-heads, businessmen
on their lunch hour, middle-aged tourists, housewives and Hasidic
Jews from nearby Catskill communities.
   ``My husband went to the first one and said we should go every
day this week and we have,'' said Lorrie Maus, a 33-year-old mother
from nearby Youngsville who brought her two children.
   Around them other children played, dogs chased each other and
music from hundreds of car stereos and acoustic guitars filled the
natural amphitheater, which was ringed by cars, buses, tents and
vendors.
   Trevor Boustead, a veteran of Woodstock, fondly recalled the late
Max Yasgur, on whose farm the original festival was held.
   ``That Yasgur, he was a good dude,'' Boustead said, recalling how
the dairy farmer gave out free milk during the concert.
``Everybody's doing the same thing now. Everybody's still friendly.
The only thing that's different is all the cars and tents.''
   Yasgur's farm now belongs to brothers Jeff And Charlie Gelish,
who were paying for half of the cost of providing water and portable
toilets for the reunion gathering.
   ``This is not a commercial venture,'' Jeff Gelish said.
   Proceeds from the entrance donation will go toward cleaning and
reseeding the field, he said. A local garbage company and a
volunteer ambulance corps are lending their services free of charge,
Gelish said.

<HEAD>Crackdown On Drug Lords After Leading Presidential Hopeful, Others
Killed</HEAD>

   Gunmen assassinated a leading
presidential hopeful and wounded at least 10 others at a political
rally and police blamed drug traffickers.
   Sen. Luis Carlos Galan was slain Friday hours after drug lords
shot to death a provinical police chief, police said.
   President Virgilio Barco responded to the murders by announcing a
harsh crackdown on drug traffickers in the nation, home of the
Medellin drug cartel. It is the world's largest cocaine ring and is
believed responsible for 80 percent of the drug smuggled into the
United States.
   Barco said in an address broadcast nationwide on television and
radio that he will use his powers under the nation's state of siege
to re-establish a treaty with the United States to extradite
suspected drug traffickers. The Supreme Court threw out the treaty
in April 1988 on a technicality.
   Barco said his government also will take other emergency measures
to stop the Medellin cartel, including seizing assets and hiring
special judges to investigate drug traffickers.
   Galan, 46, had been one of six people seeking the Liberal Party's
nomination for the May 1990 presidential election and was widely
considered the front-runner to replace Barco.
   Police said drug traffickers had offered $500,000 for his murder.
   He was shot as he was about to give a campaign speech before
10,000 people in Soacha, 20 miles south of Bogota. At least 10
others were wounded, including one of Galan's bodyguards and two
local political leaders, witnesses said.
   They said the shots were fired by a lone gunman, who escaped.
   The crowd panicked. ``The people were running, screaming and
crying,'' said Jesus Calderon, a photographer.
   Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana said Galan died of several gunshot
wounds to the chest.
   Galan had escaped an assassination attempt by drug traffickers
Aug. 5 in the city of Medellin.
   Police also blamed drug lords for Friday's attack, which came
hours after the shooting death of a provincial police chief who had
led a campaign against the drug lords in Medellin.
   The Medellin drug cartel claimed responsibility for the slaying
of Col. Waldemar Franklin Quintero in calls to local radio stations.
   Franklin Quintero, 46, police commander for Antioquia province
where Medellin is located, recently had given up his official
bodyguards and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges.
   He left his home Friday in his chauffeur-driven car, which had
traveled about 450 feet when it was cut off by another car and five
gunmen emerged, officials said.
   ``They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel,
who was hit more than a hundred times,'' an unidentified witness
told Radio Caracol. The witness said the chauffeur was injured.
   Franklin Quintero directed the local campaign against cocaine
trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure
of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers.
   The slayings were the latest in a series of attacks in the past
month and came amid a national strike by judges, who walked out on
Thursday demanding more protection from drug traffickers following
the slaying of one of their colleagues.
   Magistrate Carlos Valencia Garcia was fatally shot in Bogota on
Wednesday, hours after rejecting appeals filed on behalf of two
Medellin cartel leaders.
   ``It's terrifying what is happening in Colombia,'' Justice
Minister Monica de Grieff said on Friday.
   ``The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting
together, the government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry
to stop the wave of violence,'' she said.
   In the past 10 years, 23 judges have been assassinated and
officials blame nearly all of the slayings on drug dealers.

   Billionaire magazine publisher Malcolm
Forbes celebrates his 70th birthday today with a party for 700 of
his rich and famous friends.
   The guest list includes stars, socialities, princes, publishers,
a former president, a couple of ex-kings and, of course, close chum
Elizabeth Taylor.
   Forbes is throwing the party at his palace in this playground of
the wealthy and plans to use three planes _ including the supersonic
Concorde and his own Boeing 727, ``The Capitalist Tool'' _ to
shuttle in the lucky swells.
   The publisher of Forbes magazine is estimated to be worth $1
billion. The cost of his party has been reported to be $2 million.
   The balding and bespectacled dean of jet-setters is perhaps best
known for his iron-man endurance of the social swirl and his
much-publicized fascination with motorcyles and hot-air ballooning.
He even gave a purple Harley-Davidson to Miss Taylor, to match her
mauve eyes.
   Invitations to his birthday party have been coveted by glitterati
for months.
   Those lucky enough to receive them include former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and former President Jimmy Carter. Greek
shipowner Stavros Niarchos will be in the company of two former
kings, Constantine of Greece and Simeon of Bulgaria, along with
opera diva Beverly Sills.
   Forbes also invited media colleagues such as television
personalities Walter Cronkite and Barbara Walters, and publishers
Katharine Graham, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell.
   Other jet set guests include fashion designer Calvin Klein,
tobacco heiress Doris Duke and American politicians from both sides
of the aisle. New York developer Donald Trump also is expected.
   The setting for tonight's party is the Mendoub palace, once the
digs of the royal governor.
   The palace, one of several of Forbes' dwellings around the world,
serves most of the time as a museum. Housing his collection of tin
soldiers, the palace is a popular destination for Tangier residents.
   Five huge tents have been set up on the 15-acre Moroccan-style
garden surrounding the palace.
   Guests drew lots for tent assignments, with the lucky ones
sharing the biggest tent with the birthday boy himself. His sons are
to act as hosts at the other tents.
   Miss Taylor did not have to stand for the lottery: She's
guaranteed a spot near Forbes. The two have been regular companions
since Forbes' 39-year marriage ended in divorce in 1985.
   Each tent is furnished in true luxury, with priceless Moroccan
furniture and thick carpets from Rabat and Fez. An army of Moroccan
chefs will be working feverishly in the kitchen.
   Guests will dance to a local band playing Moroccan and Western
tunes.
   Forbes invited Morocco's ruler King Hassan II. But the king
declined, instead inviting all of Forbes' guests to a luncheon
Sunday at the Tangier Golf Club.
   Hassan's sons, Crown Prince Mohamed and Prince Rachid, will go in
their father's place.
   Hassan ordered 120 men of his mounted guard to help provide
protection for the guests.
   ``They're not just decorative,'' Forbes said. ``Those boys mean
business.''

   Two women in a hijacked helicopter plucked
two inmates from a Colorado prison yard, but the escape attempt
ended in a police shootout in a small town 400 miles away.
   The women were believed to be the wives of the two men freed at
daybreak Friday. The four ordered the helicopter pilot to fly to a
farmhouse, where they picked up a van.
   A police officer in Holdrege, a town of 5,600 in southwestern
Nebraska, spotted the van Friday evening. That began a nine-minute
chase and gunbattle through a residential area that ended after the
van had been surrounded.
   ``They picked a bad place for a shootout,'' said Police Chief
Kenneth Jackson.
   One of the escaped inmates, Ralph Brown, was shot in the hand in
the battle.
   Phelps County Deputy Attorney Rebecca Miller identified the four
people in custody after the chase as Brown, 30, cellmate Freddie
Gonzales, 21, of the Arkansas Valley Correctional Center near
Pueblo, Colo.; Rebecca Brown, 26, and Pat Gonzales, 41.
   Police recovered two 9mm pistols and a .38-caliber revolver.
   The women rented the helicopter from Helicopter Airways in
Denver, saying they wanted to take some photos of real estate near
the prison in southern Colorado, said Walter Kautzky, Colorado
Corrections Department director.
   Once near the prison, one woman pulled a gun and ordered the
pilot to land inside the compound, Kautzky said.
   Frustrated prison guards held their fire because they could not
get a clear shot at the helicopter and feared that the pilot was
being held hostage, said Liz McDonough, a Colorado corrections
spokewoman.
   Authorities ordered an investigation to determine why a guard
refused three orders from prison superintendent Jim Brittain to open
fire on the helicopter.
   ``From the time the helicopter came into view, from the point of
touchdown to takeoff, was 10 to 15 seconds,'' Brittain said.
   The pilot was found bound and gagged about 35 miles north of the
medium-security state prison and the helicopter was found nearby
after authorities received an anonymous telephone call.
   The chase began when a Holdrege police officer spotted the van
and the shooting started after the van struck a police car head-on,
Phelps County Attorney Glenn Clark said.
   ``After the first encounter they went down the street shooting
houses and at people,'' he said. At least eight shots penetrated the
windshield of the van, police said.
   The gunmen fired wildly, but there were no additional injuries,
``and that's just flat out a miracle,'' Jackson said.
   ``If all the bullets they were shooting were aimed at us, they
weren't very good shots,'' Jackson said.
   Nebraska State Patrol Sgt. Tom Nutt was standing by his car,
which he was using as a roadblock, when the van approached. He
headed for shelter behind a nearby house, but wound up diving for
the pavement in a hail of bullets.
   ``They tell us in training that the average gun battle with a law
enforcement officer lasts two and one-half seconds. I think we set
some kind of record,'' Jackson said.
   Holdrege Police, State Patrol and Phelps County Sheriff's
officers finally surrounded the rental van.
   ``Their truck had taken some pretty substantial hits in strategic
locations,'' said Jackson. ``One of the men was wounded and I think
just didn't want to run anymore.''
   The chase ended at 6:27 p.m. CDT and the bullet-shattered van sat
in the middle of a wide, brick street in the business district of
town.
   Brown was at Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney with a shotgun
pellet possibly lodged in a finger on his right hand, said Phelps
County Sheriff Dwayne Newman.
   Gonzales and one of the women were being held at the Phelps
County Jail; the second woman was being held at Holdrege police
headquarters, Clark said.
   None of the four was formally charged, but all four would
probably be in court Monday, Clark said. ``We've got plenty to hold
them on,'' he said.
   Gonzales was serving a four-year sentence for robbery and would
have been eligible for parole in September 1991. Brown was sentenced
for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check
charge; his parole eligibility date was October 1996.

<HEAD>Workers Return to Plants After Winning Right to Form Own Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at 15 U.S.-owned assembly plants
were back on the job today after a three-week strike that ended when
they won the right to form their own union.
   The strike by about 2,000 workers ended Friday afternoon when the
leaders of rival labor factions, plant managers and the labor
arbitration board signed an agreement negotiated by Tamaulipas Gov.
America Villareal.
   The strike cost the plants $500,000 a day, but management backed
the workers in their battle against the powerful Mexican Labor
Federation, and said the strike was a victory against union bossism
and corruption. The Mexican Labor Federation is Mexico's largest and
most powerful labor group.
   The agreement gives the workers the right to form their own union
and elect their own leaders even though the new union will
ostensibly be an affiliate of the Mexican Labor Federation, said
Manuel Save, the governor's spokesman.
   Talks on forming a new union are to begin next week.
   The maquiladora industry, which takes advantage of cheap labor to
assemble products for export to the United States, is a key source
of jobs and investment, and the strike had raised fears that
investor confidence in Mexico would erode.
   There are 230 maquiladora plants employing about 65,000 people in
Tamaulipas.

   The governing party candidate defeated
three major opponents in an election seen as a test of support for
President Roh Tae-woo, according to final results announced today.
   Rha Woong-bae received 45,187 votes in Friday's election to
35,089 for Lee Yong-hee of the Party for Peace and Democracy. Lee
Won-bum of the Reunification Democratic Party was third with 21,945
votes and Koh Young-koo, a lawyer who represented dissident groups,
received 8,340.
   Nearly 70 percent of the 169,812 eligible voters in the southern
Seoul district cast ballots, two percentage points higher than the
rate recorded there in the April 1988 general election.
   The District Election Management Committee, concerned about
possible violence, deployed hundreds of election officials and
police at a high school where the ballots were counted, but no
incidents were reported.
   President Roh, who took office last year, had called the race ``a
litmus test which would determine the course the nation would take.''
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the Party for Peace and Democracy, had said
the election would be a mid-term appraisal of the Roh government,
which he claimed was reneging on a campaign promise to usher in full
democracy.
   The election was called after the Supreme Court annulled the 1988
election of governing party candidate Kim Myung-sup because of
illegal campaigning. Kim did not run in the latest race.

<HEAD>Conservative Group Says Anti-Bias Ruling Will Be Overturned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer for a group called Concerned
Women for America predicted the reversal of a ruling that required
landlords to rent to an unmarried couple even though doing so was
against their religious beliefs.
   The Fair Employment and Housing Commission on Thursday said the
refusal to rent violated state laws against housing discrimination
based on marital status. But the lawyer for the group, Jordan
Lorence, called the decision ``outrageous and gutless'' and said the
courts would overturn it.
   The commission said it lacked authority to rule on the claim of a
landlady in Chico and an identical claim by apartment owners in
Downey that the rental order violated their freedom of religion.
   Because no California court has decided the religious issue, the
commission said it has no power to find a constitutional exemption
to the anti-bias laws.
   ``The marital status law is an ideological statement about sexual
morality,'' said Lorence, who's representing the Chico landlady,
Evelyn Smith. ``It's not really meant to solve a real housing
problem. ... I think what the state's doing is punishing Mrs. Smith
for not agreeing with their position.''
   He also noted that California allows its public universities to
reserve student housing for married couples.
   ``The state will prosecute Mrs. Smith for doing the very thing
the state of California does when it is the landlord,'' Lorence
said. ``They're going to have a very, very rough time explaining
that.''
   But Jonathan Lew, who prosecuted the Chico case for the state
Fair Employment and Housing Department, said the state was entitled
to decide that married students had a special need for affordable
housing without abandoning its ban on discrimination in other
rentals.
   To exempt a property owner from that ban on the grounds of
religious beliefs ``opens the floodgates to such practices as making
a moral test on the provisions of goods and services,'' Lew said.
   He said he, like Lorence, was disappointed that the commission
had not decided the religious issue.
   Courts in Minnesota and Massachusetts are also considering
challenges to their laws forbidding housing discrimination based on
marital status.
   California courts have forbidden public housing agencies from
excluding unmarried couples on ``moral'' grounds but have not yet
ruled on religious objections by private owners.
   The commission ordered Mrs. Smith to pay $454 to an unmarried
couple, Kenneth C. Phillips and Gail Randall, for their costs in
finding alternative housing, and $500 for emotional distress caused
by her refusal to rent to them in April 1987.
   She was also ordered to stop discriminating against unmarried
couples.
   The commission said Mrs. Smith, a Presbyterian, believes
unmarried sex is sinful and that she would be prevented from meeting
her late husband in the hereafter if she rented an apartment to an
unmarried couple.
   In the Downey case, John and Agnes Donahue were ordered to pay
$2,260 for economic losses and $6,000 for emotional distress to
Verna Terry and Robert Wilder and to offer them the first available
apartment.
   The commission said the couple was shocked by their rejection in
February 1987, bickered and felt pressured to lie about their
marital status in looking for other housing, and that Ms. Terry lost
sleep and had trouble at work.
   The Donahues are Roman Catholics and believe that sex outside
marriage is a mortal sin, and Mrs. Donahue further believes it is
sinful to help someone else commit a sin, the commission said.

   A 67-year-old woman foiled a robbery
attempt by bursting from her bedroom and firing a pistol at two
intruders who were in her apartment and attacking her 72-year-old
husband, police said.
   The shot hit one a woman in the upper body, police said. She was
taken to the hospital and listed in stable condition. The second
intruder, a man, fled when the shot was fired.
   Police said they were seeking an arrest warrant for the wounded
woman, 38-year-old Jacqueline Jewell. The male intruder remained at
large.
   Police did not release the elderly couple's names.
   Sgt. Michael Juda said the elderly man woke up when he heard the
two intruders banging on the door to the couple's apartment. When he
confronted them, they forced their way inside and attacked him with
a knife, police said.
   The man suffered cuts on his hand and fingers before his wife
came to his rescue, Juda said. ``He hollered for his wife to help
and she came out of the bedroom with a pistol,'' Juda said.
   Juda said police suspect the two intruders were attempting to
burglarize the apartment.

<HEAD>Thailand Embassy Secretary Shot at Intersection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second secretary of the Embassy of Thailand
was in fair condition today after being shot in the neck at an
intersection in suburban Maryland, police say.
   ``It appears to be a random shooting,'' George Ludington, a
spokesman for the Montgomery County Police Department, said early
today. ``We don't know where the shot came from.''
   Bansarn Bunnag, 30, had stopped at a red light in Wheaton, Md.,
about 11:30 p.m. Friday when the driver's door window of his car
``suddenly shattered'' and he felt a pain in his left arm, Ludington
said.
   The first secretary of the embassy, Oum Maolano, who was riding
in the passenger seat, grabbed the steering wheel and helped Bunnag
maneuver the car into a nearby service station, where Maolano called
police, said Ludington.
   Both men's wives and Maolano's one-year-old child were sitting in
the back seat. Their names were not available, and none was injured.
   Bunnag was rushed to Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, where he
underwent surgery for a bullet wound in the left side of his neck
and was listed in fair condition, Ludington said.
   ``No motive has been established,'' said Ludington, ``None.'' He
added, however, that police were investigating reports from
witnesses that a ``small red car'' had pulled up alongside Bunnag's
car when the shooting occurred.

   Seven months after the murder of Oregon
corrections chief Michael Francke, his brothers are pressing
authorities to develop their theory that corrupt prison officials
conspired to have Francke killed.
   Little information has surfaced on the killing since Francke was
stabbed in the heart outside Corrections Department headquarters
Jan. 17.
   No arrests have been made, but the death is still very much in
the news.
   Francke's brothers, Patrick, 46, and Kevin, 36, have found an
ally in Phil Stanford, a columnist for The Oregonian newspaper in
Portland who has devoted nearly two dozen columns to the Francke
slaying.
   Stanford said he thinks there's a good possibility the slaying
was part of a conspiracy to prevent Michael Francke from exposing an
``organized criminal element'' in the prison system that was
involved in drugs and corruption.
   ``I think it's something that any good investigator has to look
at again and again,'' said Stanford, who worked as a private
investigator in Miami in the early 1980s.
   Allegations of official corruption have irritated government
officials, including Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, who at one point
dismissed Stanford's columns as ``b.s.'' and ``garbage.''
   The man in charge of the investigation, Marion County District
Attorney Dale Penn, said Stanford and the Francke brothers have
produced no substantiation for their conspiracy theory.
   ``There's nothing wrong with raising it, but they've gone way
beyond raising it,'' Penn said. ``They're saying, `This is what
happened.'''
   Police said Francke, 42, was attacked at about 7 p.m. as he was
leaving work and walking to his car.
   Mortally wounded, Francke made it back to the Dome Building, the
prison department headquarters, where he broke a glass pane in a
door before collapsing.
   An hour later, late-working colleagues found Francke's car, one
door ajar, in the parking lot. But it wasn't until five hours later
that a security guard found Francke's body.
   Penn has said Francke may have been killed while interrupting a
car burglar. The death may also have been revenge for some aspect of
Francke's law enforcement work; he had been running the Oregon
prisons for about two years after heading the New Mexico prison
system.
   The Francke brothers have rejected those scenarios from the
beginning, and through interviews and daily contacts with sources
have kept constant pressure on authorities to investigate the
alleged conspiracy.
   Patrick Francke, a printing press salesman who lives in Lenexa,
Kan., said he thinks his brother was killed after he ``found some
people in administrative positions within the system who were
breaking the law.''
   ``I think somewhere along the line, there was a confrontation,''
he said.
   Kevin Francke, who owns a construction company in Port Charlotte,
Fla., said he firmly believes corrections officers or administrators
were involved in his brother's death.
   His brother told him he had uncovered ``an organized criminal
element'' and was going to make that information public, Kevin
Francke said. But proving that theory will be difficult.
   ``It's a very well-run network,'' he said. ``It's like trying to
put IBM out of business.''
   Penn said his office will continue to study the conspiracy angle,
``but we still have not uncovered one witness or one piece of
evidence that would establish or corroborate'' the theory, he said.
   Penn also expressed concern that Stanford's columns on the
subject would make potential witnesses reluctant to talk with
investigators for fear of their identities becoming public.
   Stanford rejected that criticism, saying Penn was the one who had
created a climate of rumors by refusing to divulge details of the
slaying.
   ``The case is of great interest to everyone in the state,''
Stanford said. ``It's an extremely interesting mystery, and I
wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't write about it.''

   Iran today hanged two women and 77 other
``notorious and professional'' drug smugglers, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said the convicts were hanged in
Tehran and 21 provincial cities after being found guilty by the
Islamic Revolutionary Court, which runs the nation's tough
anti-narcotics campaign.
   The agency said those executed were found guilty of continued
involvement in buying, selling and distributing several tons of
opium and hundreds of pounds of heroin; forming armed gangs; and
fighting police.
   About 900 drug smugglers have been executed since Iran started a
crackdown at the beginning of the year with a new law mandating jail
sentences for addicts and the death sentence for possessing even
small quantities of drugs.
   The highest announced one-day toll was 81 executions on March 10.
   The main opposition group Mujahedeen Khalq claims the Iranian
government is using its anti-narcotics campaign as a cover to
execute political prisoners.

   Western European countries will send
10,000 tons of beef to Poland in the next few weeks as part of a
$120 million aid package.
   The European Commission, the executive arm of the 12-nation
European Community, said Friday the beef will be drawn from storage
in West Germany and sent to Poland by Oct. 8.
   The commission said officials will decide soon the delivery dates
for cereal shipments, including 200,000 tons of wheat stored in
Germany, 75,000 tons of barley in France and 25,000 tons of barley
in Belgium.
   Another 200,000 tons of barley and 300,000 tons of wheat will be
sent later.
   The supplies are part of a package of meat, olive oil, citrus
fruits and cereals the agriculture ministers of the 12 EC nations
agreed last month to give Poland, which has been hit hard by
shortages.
   The EC is sending the food free of charge on the condition the
government sell it and use the money to improve the economy,
especially the private farm sector. The Polish government has agreed
to set up a ``counterpart fund,'' which is often used in development
programs, to handle the money.
   The trading bloc and Polish officials will administer the fund
jointly, according to a letter initialed by the two sides earlier
this month.
   President Bush and leaders of other rich democracies, holding
their annual summit last month in Paris, asked the community to
coordinate economic aid for Poland and Hungary. They also urged
emergency food shipments for Poland.
   Western nations want to encourage the drive in Eastern Europe for
more open political and market-oriented economic systems.
   Officials of two dozen Western nations met in Brussels on Aug. 1
to look at how they can help Poland and Hungary.
   At the meeting, the United States pledged to remove $50 million
in food from its surplus stocks for Poland, on top of $9 million in
food earmarked earlier. Austria and Switzerland also promised food
aid.
   Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski sent a letter last month to
community officials asking for 685,000 tons of beef, pork, powdered
milk, butter, oils, wheat, corn, rice and sugar in the next few
months.
   He said Poland would need at least 3.7 million tons of food next
year and again in 1991. He also asked for 250,000 tons of feed for
animals and at least $220 million worth of pesticides and similar
products in 1990.

   The second explosion this year at a commercial
powder factory killed two workers and injured six others.
   The blast Friday afternoon at the Atlas Powder Co. occurred when
employees poured molten primer into a 1-pound mold. The solidified
primer is used to ignite blasting agents, said Peter Astrauskas,
technical director.
   The building where the explosion took place will be closed until
the cause of the explosion is determined. All production was stopped
at the plant but probably will resume Monday, Astrauskas said.
   Two of the injured workers were in good condition today at St.
John's Medical Center in Joplin. Four others were treated and
released.
   Another explosion at the plant about five miles east of Joplin
occurred March 22.
   Two employees were hurt in a reactor unit that turns nitric acid
and ammonium into ammonium nitrate. The cleanup from that explosion
cost between $750,000 and $1 million.
   Astrauskas said he knew of no fatal accidents at the plant since
just after World War II. The factory employs about 400 people and
makes commercial explosives of various types, he said.

   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah today pledged to
launch suicide attacks to foil what it called a campaign by the
United States, France and the Vatican against Moslems in the Middle
East.
   Police said one person was killed and nine wounded in clashes
between Syrian and Christian forces around the Christian enclave.
   ``The French naval buildup in the Mediterranean, the pope's
fanatic and biased stands and America's moves at the (U.N.) Security
Council are part of the arrogant campaign aimed at taming the
Moslems,'' Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a statement published
in Beirut newspapers.
   The campaign, according to the statement, also aims at stripping
Moslems of their rights and covering up Israel's crimes in the
territory it holds.
   ``This campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the
Crusaders' invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of
martyrdom that forced the (U.S.) Marines and the French to retreat
in 1983,'' the statement said.
   That was a reference to the suicide truck bomb attacks against
the U.S. Marine base and the French paratroop headquarters in Beirut
that killed 241 American servicemen and 58 French soldiers in
October 1983.
   The bombings eventually led to the withdrawal from Beirut of a
multinational peacekeeping force that also contained Italian and
British contingents.
   Reports said the statement was released after a four-day meeting
of the Hezbollah student council.
   France recently dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch and the
destroyer Duquesne to the eastern Mediterranean to help evacuate an
estimated 7,000 French nationals _ most duel citizens _ if necessary.
   Paris has no intention to intervene militarily, French Ambassador
Rene Ala told a news conference in Beirut Friday.
   By police count, the 5-month-old confrontation between Gen.
Michel Aoun's 20,000 predominantly Christian troops and Syria's
40,000 soldiers backed by allied Lebanese and Palestinian factions
has killed 780 people and wounded 2,118.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, Syria's closest ally in the
confrontation, has rejected a U.N. Security Council call for a
cease-fire in the confrontation with the 54-year-old Aoun.
   French government envoy Alain Decaux ended a two-day mission in
Lebanon early today, leaving via military helicopter for Larnaca,
Cyprus, where he transferred to a jet bound for Paris.
   Ala described Decaux's visits, which included talks with
Jumblatt, Aoun and other Moslem and Christian leaders, as
``successful.'' He would not elaborate.
   Jumblatt, according to the leftist daily newspaper As-Safir, said
Hezbollah has also entered the battle against Aoun and that a
cease-fire will not be achieved if Iraq continues to supply Aoun
with weapons.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, has declared support for Aoun's
``war of liberation'' to drive the 40,000 Syrian troops out of
predominantly Moslem Lebanese territories under their control.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan agreed at a
meeting in Baghdad Friday to call an emergency Arab summit on
Lebanon.
   The current round of violence broke out March 8, two days after
Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by the Druse militia and another
Syrian-backed forces south of Beirut for denying the ailing
government treasury about $100 million in lost customs dues annually.
   The Syrians and allied forces retaliated by besieging and
shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   Beirut took the brunt of the shelling duels, which have forced
all but 150,000 of its 1.5 million population to flee the city.

   The husband of the driver of a truck
carrying warplane ammunition crawled to safety through an exploding
barrage of shells after the truck crashed and exploded in the desert.
   The wreck 30 miles north of Phoenix early Friday caused a
10-mile-long traffic backup on Interstate 17 while state police
cordoned off the area to recover hundreds of live 20mm projectiles.
   Nearly 40,000 rounds of shells and bullets went up in the
explosion and fire.
   The two northbound lanes of the freeway were restricted to one
this morning while the cleanup continued, state Department of Public
Safety spokesman Allan Schmidt said.
   ``They're looking especially for those explosive projectiles that
are undetonated,'' Schmidt said. ``Then they're going to take three
to four inches of soil as best they can around that truck and load
it into some sort of vehicle and take that to some range where they
can sift it out.''
   The driver, Lois Ann Bailey, 38, of Cullman, Ala., was killed
instantly in the crash of the truck carrying 17 tons of ammunition,
he said.
   Rick Bailey, 36, was thrown from a sleeper compartment in the
cab, which disintegrated in the blaze, Schmidt said.
   ``One minute, he was asleep. The next minute, he was badly
injured in the desert,'' Schmidt said.
   Bailey's escape involved not only avoiding flames but the shells
intended for use in F-15 and F-16 Air Force jets and other weapons,
Schmidt said.
   A passer-by picked up Bailey and drove him to the Rock Springs
store, where they used a pay phone to notify authorities, Schmidt
said.
   Bailey was taken to John C. Lincoln Hospital in Phoenix, where he
was listed in serious condition with broken ribs and other injuries.
   Mrs. Bailey's body wasn't found for hours because of the danger
of exploding shells, Schmidt said.
   People were kept several hundred yards from the accident scene as
a four-person Army explosives team recovered about 300 unexploded
shells and similar amount of bullets which Schmidt said were
``partially exploded'' and still dangerous.
   ``If the public thought of it as a hand grende, they might get a
concept of what it's like when one of these (projectiles) goes off.
It's basically that kind of explosion _ these are designed to
fragment and blow off into a lot of little pieces, and they could
take off a hand,'' Schmidt said.
   The truck, hauling the ammunition from Fort Huachuca in Sierra
Vista in southeast Arizona to the Navajo Army Depot near Flagstaff,
apparently was traveling through a storm when it veered left into a
guardrail, Schmidt said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa persuaded two small parties that
hold the balance of power in the Sejm, or parliament, to join
Solidarity in a coalition.
   Consequently, the Communist alliance in the Sejm lost its
majority.
   The Communist prime minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, resigned
after trying for two weeks to form a government.
   Jaruzelski met with Walesa, reportedly agreed to the coalition
idea and agreed to pick a member of Solidarity to lead it.

<HEAD>SCLC Ends Convention; Signs Affirmative Action Pact With Shoney's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Southern Christian Leadership Conference
signed an affirmative action pact with a fast-food chain that had
been accused of discriminating against black employees at one of its
restaurants.
   The accord capped a four-day convention where the organization
planned ways to preserve minority set-asides and battle recent
Supreme Court decisions that threaten affirmative action.
   Under the agreement, the Nashville, Tenn.-based Shoney's Inc.
will recruit and train blacks as managers and establish black-owned
Shoney's, Captain D's and Lee's Chicken franchises over the next
three years.
   The agreement signed by SCLC President Joseph Lowery and J.
Mitchell Boyd, chief executive officer of Shoney's, covers 700
company-owned restaurants. Shoney's owns or franchises 1,600
restaurants in 30 states, many of them in the South.
   The pact also called for the company to give contracts to
black-owned public relations, insurance and construction firms.
   The agreement resulted from complaints by black employees at a
Captain D's restaurant in Anniston, Ala., that working conditions
were poor and that management discriminated against them, said John
Nettles, president of the SCLC's Anniston chapter.
   The National Association for Advancement of Colored People's
Legal Defense Fund has filed a class-action lawsuit against Shoney's
as a result of similar complaints at a Florida restaurant. Boyd said
the agreement was not related to that lawsuit.
   In a speech to the convention on its opening day Tuesday, Vice
President Dan Quayle said the Bush administration and civil rights
leaders agree that civil rights gains must be preserved, but
differed on how to do it.
   Lowery said the administration wants to limit minimum wage
increases and disagrees with SCLC's position on defense and social
spending levels.
   ``All we're arguing about now is the dollar signs. They are in
office; they have the resources,'' Lowery said. ``If they don't put
their money where their mouth is, then we've got a discrepancy.''
   The SCLC intends to join other civil rights groups in Washington
for an Aug. 26 march for affirmative action.

   A 72-year-old Chinatown businessman pleaded
guilty to brokering an operation that put hundreds of pounds of
heroin on the streets.
   Peter Woo, an influential leader in New York's Chinese community,
Friday told U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie that he conspired
with his codefendants to possess heroin and distribute it in Queens
and other parts of the city.
   Woo brought wholesale heroin buyers and sellers together, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles E. Rose.
   He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine when he
is sentenced by Dearie. No sentencing date had been set.
   Woo, the owner of a Chinatown liquor store, was arrested in
February when federal and city lawmen broke up the drug ring, seized
820 pounds of high-grade Asian heroin worth $1 billion at three
homes and confiscated $3 million in cash.
   Federal authorities have charged 29 others with participating in
the organization. Woo, alleged leader of the ring, was the first to
enter a plea, Rose said. He remained in custody on $2 million bail.
   At the time of the arrests, the assistant FBI director in charge
of the New York office, James M. Fox, said the heroin bust was the
largest ever in the United States.
   Woo, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Canton, China, and
came to the United States about three decades ago. He owned a liquor
store on Mott Street and ran the Chinatown Democratic Club in the
same building.

<TEXT>
   California Rep. Ron Dellums brought laughter to
about 5,000 people attending a memorial service for his late
colleague Mickey Leland with anecdotes about the congressman who
died in a plane crash in Ethiopia.
   ``In 1970 when I first won my first election, the shot heard
around America was, `Afro child, bell-bottomed, racial black dude
from Berkeley wins election,' '' Dellums said Friday night to the
laughter of the crowd, including Leland's wife, Alison. ``Eight
years later, my colleagues walked up to me and said, `Brother,
you're not alone anymore. The 5th Ward in Houston sent an Afro
child.' ''
   ``When I saw a picture of him (Leland) with his afro bigger than
mine, I said that's going to be my brother,'' Dellums said.
   The California congressman described Leland as a compassionate
man who strived to meet all his goals, foremost to end world hunger.
   The twin-engine plane carrying Leland, 44, and 15 others crashed
Aug. 7 on its way to a refugee camp near the Sudanese border.
   Leland, a six-term congressman and chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger, was leading an American-Ethiopian delegation
concerned with feeding hundreds of thousands of Sudanese forced from
their homes by civil war.
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said that despite their political
differences, he and Leland were the best of friends.
   ``He'd tell people I was his basketball coach,'' Fields said. He
also recalled how Leland once made a 3-point field goal, then
stopped the game so he could call his wife to tell her of his first
3-pointer.
   Fields said Leland would rejoice at knowing that his death had
brought national attention to world hunger.
   Other speakers included Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
   ``Everything we're saying about Mickey tonight was true a month
ago and wasn't being said,'' Jackson said.
   After a color guard procession opened the service, children
carrying food filled six baskets in front of the podium. Seven
pallbearers carried a simple pine casket _ a ``plain pine box'' that
Leland requested in the event of his death.
   Leland's family is planning a private burial, pending the return
of his remains from Ethiopia, probably some time next week,
according to family friends.

<HEAD>Japan to Conduct Survey on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will conduct a study next year to determine
the effects of acid rain on its forests, which cover 70 percent of
the land.
   The study, the most comprehensive of its kind in Japan, will also
recommend ways to improve the condition of the forests, Yutaka
Kawanaka of the Forestry Agency said in a statement today.
   Acid rain results from the mixture of rain and sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants that enter the atmosphere
mainly as emissions from factories and electric power plants. The
study will begin April 1, 1990 and take samples from 1,200 locations
within the nation's forests, Kawanaka said.
   Until recently, Japan paid little attention to acid rain and the
damage it has caused. The United States and Europe have been
studying the problem for some time, although critics say they have
taken few steps to stop acid rain.
   ``Damage caused by acid rain has been negligible in Japan because
we have rich, thick soil that is hard to acidify, whereas soil in
Europe and the United States is thin and easily acidified,''
Kawanaka said. ``Also, coniferous or evergreen trees, including the
fir prevalent in Europe, are more easily damaged than the
broad-leaved deciduous forests we have in Japan.''
   However, Japan's Environmental Agency recently reported the
results of a five-year survey that concluded that acid rain has been
falling all over Japan. It did not specify whether damage has been
done.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Drops Hard-Liners From Cabinet</HEAD>

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani announced his
Cabinet nominees to parliament today and left out one of his rivals,
a hard-line interior minister, against the request of more than half
the lawmakers.
   Rafsanjani replaced Ali Akbar Mohtashemi with Abdullah Nouri, a
leading figure in the Revolutionary Guards, a branch of the
military, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Earlier today, the government-supervised Tehran Times had
reported that Rafsanjani would not include his hard-line opponents
in the Cabinet.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said more than half the nominees were
new faces and news reports indicated the list could cause a
political brawl in parliament.
   Rafsanjani had been expected to present his Cabinet to the
Majlis, or parliament, on Sunday. The Majlis was scheduled to review
and approve new procedures for appointing ministers today, and it
apparently finished its work early enough for Rafsanjani to give the
lawmakers his list.
   The 270-member parliament must confirm each nominee.
   Former Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and Minister of Intelligence
Mohammad Reyshahri, two other major figures in the faction opposed
to Rafsanjani, would also be eliminated from the new government,
IRNA quoted the Tehran Times as saying. Musavi's post of prime
minister was scrapped under constitutional changes that concentrate
executive power in the presidency.
   The paper said unidentified sources provided the details for its
story.
   IRNA said that 138 deputies signed a letter, read in the Majlis
earlier today, asking Rafsanjani to keep Mohtashemi as interior
minister.
   The report indicated that the deputies acknowledged the
competition between the two men, saying: ``The presence of powerful
personalities in the future Cabinet is inevitable.''
   But it urged him to appoint Mohtashemi, noting the ``sensitivity
of the arrogant world'' _ the usual reference to the United States _
to the issue.
   Rafsanjani acknowledged during his inauguration speech Thursday
that a fight was brewing over his appointments, with some ministers
refusing to serve in his government.
   IRNA did not indicate in its report whether Rafsanjani's rivals
were being dumped or had declined to work with him.
   Rafsanjani is viewed a pragmatist, seeking more private
investment and links with the West to obtain the technology and
financing to rebuild an economy shattered by eight years of war with
Iraq.
   His hard-line rivals support a centralized economy and believe
that confrontation with the West better serves the Islamic
revolution.
   The shape of Rafsanjani's government, and especially the
competition with the hard-line faction, will determine how fast Iran
moves on a number of foreign policy issues, such as signing a peace
treaty with Iraq and pressuring pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon to
release the Western hostages they hold.

<HEAD>Chinese Defense Minister Seen On Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, whom Chinese sources
have reported is engaged in a power struggle for control of the
army, appeared on national television today at the funeral of a
revolutionary veteran.
   Qin was shown in a news report on the funeral of Fu Zhong, a
legislator and former colonel-general, along with other top Chinese
leaders. The report did not identify him by name, although it
identified the other leaders.
   Chinese sources say Qin, 75, is engaged in a struggle with
President Yang Shangkun for control of the army and the nation after
the death of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who is believed to be very
ill. Deng turns 85 Tuesday.
   The sources said Thursday that troops commanded by Yang led Qin
away from his Beijing residence on Wednesday evening after Qin
argued with Yang over which of them should be promoted to first vice
chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission. The post was
held by former party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang until he was
stripped of all his jobs in June.
   Deng is commission chairman, and first vice chairman is the
second only to Deng. Yang currently is permanent vice chairman and
secretary general of the commission.
   Several Chinese sources in Beijing and Hong Kong said that after
being led away Qin was placed under house arrest, but the television
appearance seemed to rule that out.
   The Defense Ministry denied to foreign reporters Friday that Qin
was arrested or deposed as defense minister but did not specificly
deny he was detained by troops on Yang's orders. Telephone calls to
the Defense Ministry were not answered today.
   One source, in Hong Kong, said Yang held a meeting Friday night
of top military commanders to discuss his appointment as first vice
chairman, but that the commanders did not express support. Yang
asked them to stay in Beijing until a decision can be reached.
   The source said Deng's health is deteriorating rapidly. Military
commanders who visited him this week found he was so infirm that he
could not speak, the source said. He said his information came from
the wife of one commander and secretary of another.
   A Western diplomat said the reported struggle between Qin and
Yang is over more than just the military commission's vice
chairmanship.
   ``The general consensus here is that it's the top post, Deng's
position, that is at stake,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Zhao was ousted after losing a power struggle with conservatives
who accused him of supporting student pro-democracy protests this
spring. Yang helped lead the army crackdown on the protesters June
3-4, but Qin was believed to oppose it.
   The Western diplomat said regional military commanders were
opposing Yang's attempts to elevate himself because of his extensive
family connections in the military.
   Yang's is one of the strongest military families in China.

   Pope John Paul II today
praised plans for a Solidarity-led government in his native Poland
and indicated he might travel to Lebanon soon on a mission of peace.
   The pontiff, traveling to Spain for the third time, said he had
not yet received a response from Lebanese authorities to his recent
statement that he would like to visit the war-ravaged Middle Eastern
country.
   However, he told reporters traveling on his plane: ``We can say a
certain interest has been shown.''
   He refused to elaborate, but his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, said
the interest had come from various foreign ministries, which he did
not identify.
   The pope has expressed outrage at the recent fighting in Lebanon
between Christian and Syrian-led forces, and last week said he felt
an ``imperative'' to visit the country. More than 750 people have
been killed since the latest round of battles in the nation's
14-year-old civil war broke out in March.
   Asked whether he was satisfied with developments in Poland, where
a non-communist-led government was expected to take power, John Paul
grinned broadly and said, ``more or less.''
   ``All that has been done is very important, a step forward,'' he
said.
   ``It's not easy,'' he added.
   The pope is an old friend of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity
journalist reported Friday to be Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski's choice for prime minister.
   John Paul's outspoken support of Solidarity is credited with
keeping the independent labor movement alive during the seven years
it was outlawed.
   The pontiff last met with Mazowiecki on his third trip to Poland
in 1987, Navarro said.
   The focus of the trip was the fourth Vatican-sponsored World
Youth Day today, which has drawn 300,000 young people from 55
countries to this city, one of the three most important pilgrimage
sites in the history of the church.
   The 69-year-old pontiff donned a traditional brown pilgrim's
mantle over his white robes and walked the final 100 yards of the
500-mile Way of St. James to show his symbolic participation in the
trek from the Pyrenees to Santiago.
   Once there, he spoke briefly to thousands of cheering youths and
embraced a statue of St. James in the cathedral in accordance with
another pilgrim custom.
   Millions of pilgrims have traveled to the northwestern Spanish
city in the 11 centuries since the bones of the martyred apostle St.
James were reportedly found there.
   The pope is using the symbol of the Santiago pilgrimage to urge
young people to spread their faith to places where it doesn't exist,
and to revive it in First World countries where religious practice
has declined.
   ``The church of today is preparing itself for a new
Christianization, which is presented to you as a challenge,'' he
said in a speech at Santiago's airport, where he was greeted by
Spanish King Juan Carlos.
   Of particular concern to the church as it approaches its 2,000th
birthday is the dramatic slide in the practice of religion in
traditionally Roman Catholic European countries.
   Both in Europe and the United States, John Paul has condemned
what he considers First World ills: consumerism and ``secular''
attitudes promoting premarital sex and divorce.
   This weekend's celebrations include a papal address to a youth
rally at a mountain outside Santiago today, and a Mass on Sunday.
About 160 bishops are attending the celebrations, which were
preceded by a week of cultural and religious meetings for youth
leaders.
   The events have drawn young people from countries including
communist-ruled Cuba, Bulgaria and Soviet Lithuania. Most are being
housed in tents, turning the city of 85,000 and its environs into a
giant campground.
   Many of those participating in the Youth Day followed part of the
old pilgrimage route this week. Police said Friday that a French
priest had died of a heart attack while cycling along the route to
Santiago for the papal visit.
   After his visit to Santiago, the pope is to address Catholics in
the northern cities of Oviedo and Covadonga.
   The pope may speak about the shift away from church practice in
the 11 years since Catholicism was dropped as the state religion,
which it was under dictator Francisco Franco.
   Spain now has a limited abortion law and another giving the state
effective control over subsidies to and curricula of religious
schools. Both took effect in 1985, following visits by John Paul in
1982 and 1984.
   A security force of about 5,000 Civil Guards and police are on
hand for the pontiff's visit.

   The mighty Mississippi once carried cargo and cotton and damsels
and dandies up and down the lazy river. Now Iowans are betting these
waters will deliver them another precious commodity _ greenbacks.
   Iowa, known more for hogs than high rollers, is moving to revive
riverboat gambling, hoping the romance of the past will generate
riches for the future _ and it's not alone.
   Across America's heartland, several states are planning or
considering gambling ventures to try to bring dollars, jobs and
tourists into struggling industrial cities and small towns hit hard
this decade by factory closings, the farm depression and the exodus
of jobs and people.
   ``If we were still doing well and had not turned into the great
Rust Belt, you would not see this great influx of gambling in the
guise of economic development,'' said state Sen. Denny Jacobs, a key
supporter of riverboat gambling in Illinois. ``It's a nice stopgap
until we can readjust ourselves and get back on two solid feet.''
   Soon there will be wagers in the land of Wild Bill Hickok, the
gold rush town of Deadwood, S.D. There's gambling talk, too, in
Indiana, Missouri and Wisconsin.
   That's not to suggest there aren't skeptics and critics. Some
argue the stakes are too low to be an economic salvation, the sites
too ho-hum or bleak for tourism.
   Others fear games of chance will erode the American Gothic ethic.
   ``When gambling comes in, all of the other social crimes
increase,'' said Owen Primavera, spokesman for the Iowa Alliance
Against Casino Gambling. ``It increases loan sharking. It increases
drug traffic ... (and) prostitution.''
   Supporters insist they intend to create family entertainment.
   ``Those traditional Midwest heartland values are ... still going
to be there,'' said Larry Reed, executive vice president of the
Davenport Chamber of Commerce in Iowa.
   The only change, proponents say, is the Midwest will being doing
more to strut its stuff.
   ``The Mississippi is well known worldwide,'' said Don Rinehart,
executive vice president of the River City Chamber of Commerce in
Iowa. ``(It's) a gold mine in our backyard and we haven't taken
advantage of it.''
   ``It's all right to be homespun,'' Jacobs said. ``That's part of
the charm of the Midwest. But it may be time we get a little more
sophisticated.''
   And gambling seems a logical step with the increasing popularity
of bingo, lotteries and horse and dog tracks. In North Dakota, for
example, a record $205 million was wagered on games of chance last
year, including pull tabs, blackjack and bingo.
   More than 30 states have lotteries and more than 40 have
parimutuel betting, said William Thompson, a University of
Nevada-Las Vegas management and public administration professor and
co-author of a book on casinos.
   There's more to come:
   _ In Deadwood, S.D., there will be poker, blackjack and slot
machines, probably in October. Voters this spring approved gambling.
City proceeds will go to historic preservation in this once
rip-roaring Black Hills town where Hickok's last poker game ended
with a bullet in his head.
   ``What we're really doing is returning to our past and saying
that's really our future,'' said Bill Walsh, co-owner of a local
hotel.
   _ In Gary, Ind., a struggling steel capital on Lake Michigan,
voters will be asked in a non-binding November referendum whether
they want resort hotels with casino gambling. Supporters of casino
gambling in Lorain, Ohio, say they are not giving up despite failing
to get enough signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. In
1988, Detroit rejected casinos for the third time in 12 years.
   _ In Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri, some lawmakers want to
mimic Iowa and put riverboats and other floating casinos on parts of
the Great Lakes, the Mississippi and other waterways.
   The Illinois House in June rejected such a plan but a task force
has since been formed to study the issue so lawmakers can reconsider
it in the fall.
   Many Illinois officials are eager to put paddlewheelers in the
water before Iowa, which doesn't start riverboat gambling until
April 1991. Iowa requires county referendums before gambling can
begin in each local area.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has proposed creating a regional agency
to monitor riverboat gambling on the states' boundary waters.
   The lure of big tourist bucks is particularly appealing to
Mississippi River towns in both states, which have lost thousands of
manufacturing jobs in the last decade.
   Iowa has estimated gambling on its rivers and lakes could
generate $1.7 billion in spinoffs from tourism and new business.
   There's concern, though, riverboats could cut into the bingo and
racing profits.
   Further, Reed said, ``At some point, you reach a saturation
point. If Iowa has it, Illinois and Wisconsin ... the impact of it
for any individual state is going to be diluted.''
   Some experts say Iowa's riverboat project already is in trouble
because of a $5 limit per bet, $200 cap on nightly losses and 20
percent casino revenue tax that will make it harder to reap a profit.
   Iowa ``has produced an unworkable bill that will probably result
in naught,'' Daniel Lee, senior analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said in a report.
   He added in a telephone interview: ``They're going to throw a
party no one will go to.''
   Especially, some say, if it's far away.
   ``People from around the country are not going to travel to Iowa
to spend $5 on riverboat gambling,'' said Professor Thompson.
``Everything that is good about it lends itself to being small ...
(But) if it's small it's not going to add much to the economy.''
   But local folks insist they're not expecting miracles.
   ``I don't think anybody has touted riverboat gambling as the
answer to their economic woes,'' Rinehart said. ``It's like chicken
soup. It can't hurt and it looks like it could help. ... It's just
another piece of ammunition to lure people.''
   That's also what Deadwood hopes to do.
   ``There's no other way we could think of to raise money,'' said
Melodee Nelson, head of the Deadwood You Bet Committee. ``Deadwood
is sitting 45 miles from a major airport, 15 miles from the
interstate. No industry is going to come to Deadwood.''
   But big cities that have industry and are looking for gambling to
reverse their fortunes also face obstacles, said John Dombrink,
associate social ecology professor at the University of
California-Irvine and Thompson's co-author.
   ``It's kind of Pollyannish to think a blue-collar industrial city
is somehow tailor-made for ... a tourist industry,'' he said.
```Tourism is not like a nose job, where one day you can wave a
wand. ... It might take a long time for people's perceptions to
change.''
   But some in Gary, Ind., believe the scenic lakefront and
proximity to Chicago will make the city an ideal casino site,
despite its problems with shuttered stores, a bleak downtown and a
shrinking workforce.
   ``I think it's Gary's last shot at an economic development
project that will deliver in the magnitude the steel mills once
delivered on,'' said state Rep. Earline Rogers, a supporter.
``Nothing else we've looked at will revitalize Gary in the same
manner. If casino gambling can't do it, nothing can.''

   Only a few countries in the Communist world have
benefited from Mikhail Gorbachev's reform movement. The norm still
is old-fashioned Stalinist doctrine and lack of economic and
political freedom. Here is a report by an Associated Press
correspondent who has reported widely on developments in the
Communist bloc.

<TEXT>
   Despite momentous reforms in the Soviet
Union, Poland, and Hungary, the march toward democracy and personal
freedom has made little, if any progress elsewhere in the vast
Communist world in the four years since President Mikhail Gorbachev
took power in the Kremlin.
   The Soviet reforms, however, and the increasingly obvious
failures of state-controlled economies to match Western technology
and consumer plenty have encouraged people under Communist rule to
demand change.
   The responses of their governments range from tinkering with the
economy while leaving political reform alone to outright repression.
Huge security networks still are deployed to crush or at least curb
free speech as aging leaders from Havana to East Berlin, Prague,
Sofia and Bucharest cling to power.
   The most vivid display of old-style Communist determination to
stay in power at any cost has come in China.
   Before the eyes of a world, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
pro-democracy demonstrators were felled by military tanks and
gunfire early in June.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, more people have been arrested and
dozens executed since.
   Romania and Cuba are other examples where little has changed
since Gorbachev emerged on the world scene. In fact, conditions may
actually have deteriorated.
   ``While in other Socialist countries, they are taking steps
toward a more open society, in Romania it's going exactly
backwards,'' said Paula Tscherne, who monitors human rights for the
Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation.
   Food in shops is scarcer and rationing of bread and other staples
more widespread the longer Nicolae Ceausescu presides over the land
once known as the breadbasket of southeastern Europe.
   Senior Communists and well-known writers demanding change face
house arrest, jail or mental hospitals; less prominent dissenters
disappear without a trace.
   In Cuba, Fidel Castro, like Ceausescu, harangues Soviet-style
reform as a return to capitalism.
   In an unexplained move attributed by some analysts to internal
power struggles, the nation's top general was recently executed
after being convicted of drug trafficking; three dissidents face up
to four years in jail after reportedly telling foreigners that
confessions at the trial were extracted by torture.
   In rigid East Germany, desperation over the lack of political and
economic reform is driving hundreds of thousands to apply to
emigrate West.
   Thousands more who can't stand the years of waiting for legal
permission to go are escaping in the biggest human flow westward
since the Communists built the Berlin Wall in 1961.
   ``We're just second-class citizens here, or worse,'' one East
German told Western reporters.
   ``My parents said, `go, we'd go too if we were younger,''' said
an East Berlin woman in her early 20s, one of hundreds fleeing
across Hungary's newly porous border with Austria. Pointing to other
youths who did the same, she added, ``We all work in professions
where you actually make money in East Germany. But there's nothing
to spend it on.''
   Other Communist governments that have rejected genuine reforms
vacillate between concessions and repression.
   Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, whose Communists traditionally have
paid much heed to Moscow, have lent strong verbal support to
Gorbachev's perestroika, or restructuring, and claimed to be
implementing their own versions.
   In both countries, however, reform seems skin-deep, limited to
some new freedom in the state-controlled arts and changes billed as
improvements in running stagnating state economies.
   ``Certain surface, let's say, official improvements have been
made,'' said Jana Starek of the International Helsinki Federation.
``Unfortunately, nothing has changed as far as strictly political
cases, cases of religious belief and independent civil organizations
are concerned.''
   In Czechoslovakia, which has perhaps the strongest democratic
traditions of any Soviet bloc nation, sporadic anti-government
protests and petitions for reform have yielded nothing but more
harassment and jail for dissidents and their supporters.
   In Bulgaria, organized dissident groups have emerged for
virtually the first time under Communist rule. But activists have
quickly found the limits of glasnost, Bulgarian-style, suffering
police harassment, imprisonment or forced emigration.
   Bulgaria's ethnic Turks are fleeing by the hundreds of thousands
to Turkey after at least nine people died in May protests against an
assimilation campaign and authorities began deporting dozens of
ethnic Turkish activists.
   In Yugoslavia, still freer in spirit than the Soviet bloc with
which it broke in 1948, ethnic tension is also mounting, fueled by
economic chaos resulting from a decentralized political system and
state mismanagement of agriculture and industry.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been jailed since they
protested last spring against constitutional changes they say curbed
their autonomy in Yugoslavia.
   While Europe's Communist nations are embroiled in upheaval,
Vietnam, a nation ravaged by turmoil for decades, seems calmly to be
implementing its version of perestroika, known as ``doi moi.''
   According to a recent report in the authoritative British weekly
The Economist, ``doi moi'' has not halted the flow of boat people
risking their lives to escape Communist Vietnam. But it has raised
economic production _ and hopes _ without yet firing political
unrest.
   In Europe, steeped in traditions of individual liberty, the
lifting of the rigid clamp of totalitarianism seems fraught with
more danger.
   The restructuring of a vast, diverse country such as the Soviet
Union seems unable to proceed without the upheaval seen in the
Baltic republics, the Caucasus and in Siberian and Ukrainian miners'
strikes.
   Fear of such turbulence bolsters Communist governments that have
so far rejected change. In Czechoslovakia, for example, living
standards are still relatively high and workers living for four
decades by the East bloc motto ``we pretend to work, and they
pretend to pay us'' are afraid reform will send artificially low
prices soaring and put them out of their cozy jobs.
   Popular pressure for change could mount if Poland or Hungary
proves that smaller, more developed and more ethnically homogenous
nations than the Soviet Union can achieve democratic reform without
major upheaval.
   Younger Communists also may prove more willing to countenance
change than the older leaders in power now: East Germany's Erich
Honecker, 76; Czechoslovakia's Gustav Husak, 75; Bulgaria's Todor
Zhivkov, 77; Ceausescu, 71; and Castro, younger at 62 but at the top
since 1959.
   When it does come, however, change may not be as sudden as it has
been in the past breathtaking months in the Soviet Union, Poland and
Hungary.
   Interim Communist leaders may preside over a period of more
gradual reform before relinquishing or sharing power, argues one
Western analyst speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's not like a trigger that will suddenly produce Poszgays
(Imre Poszgay is Hungary's most reform-minded Communist) or
Gorbachevs in East Germany,'' he added.
   ``Precisely because they have held out for such a long time and
their people see that change can be painful, these nations might
need another tinkering period before they start on their own.''

<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday began releasing
more than 1,000 prisoners who had been held without charge since
1986 on suspicion of supporting rebel groups.
   The minister for internal affairs, Ibrahim Mukiibi, announced the
release Friday. He said the 1,086 political detainees would be
transported to their home areas.
   The prisoners were captured during fighting between government
troops and the rebel Uganda People's Democratic Army in 1986.
   They are the third group of prisoners to be released since the
rebels signed a peace accord with the government in June 1988.
   On June 20, 1988, 1,671 prisoners were released, and in October
950 more were freed.
   The latest release would leave an estimated 1,730 political
prisoners still in Uganda's prisons.
   Human rights groups have singled out the government of President
Yoweri Museveni for holding the detainees without charge or trial.

   It was Nov. 10, 1938 in Wittenberg, Germany,
and 11-year-old Richard Wiener sat in his aunt's apartment among the
broken glass, china and furniture left behind the night before by a
rampaging Nazi mob.
   Only one friend dared visit the apartment to warn Wiener it was
too dangerous to return to a school where he was the only Jewish
student. The schoolmate, Werner Lindemann, had parents who didn't
like Hitler and he was the only gentile at the school who refused to
wear the uniform of Hitler's youth organization.
   That November and the months that followed summon painful
memories for the 62-year-old Wiener, but one pleasant recollection
has unexpectedly returned.
   After 50 years, Richard Wiener and Werner Lindemann have found
each other.
   Wiener, now a patent attorney in Washington, and Lindemann, a
retired physician living near Wittenberg in East Germany, correspond
regularly, and Wiener is considering a personal visit.
   Playing the central role in their reunion was last fall's 50th
anniversary of ``Kristallnacht'' _ the night of the broken glass _
when Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues were destroyed in
Germany and Austria.
   Wiener agreed last November to relive his experience in a special
service at his synagogue, Temple Sinai in Washington. While
preparing for the event, Wiener opened his mailbox one day to find a
letter from East Germany.
   The note from Lindemann was short. The East German said he felt
compelled to write because of the anniversary. Wiener still isn't
sure how Lindemann found his address.
   ``His next letter was very lengthy,'' Wiener said. ``He told me
everything since school. To me, it meant a lot. I have a great need
to feel connected to my past.''
   ``Dear Richard,'' Lindemann wrote last January. ``Those were
stormy times. I'm happy you still speak of Wittenberg as your home.
Many Germans fall silent when they think about the persecution of
the Jews. ... I have felt that since childhood the Nazis were evil,
but my eyes were not opened until 1945. Until then, I knew nothing
of the concentration camps, nothing of the killing which took place
daily...
   ``You had such a difficult childhood. Unimaginable.''
   Last month, Lindemann pleaded: ``Please come as soon as possible.
It would make me so happy.''
   The letters sent Wiener's thoughts rolling back in time, and he
recalled that his friend's visit after Crystal Night wasn't the only
time Lindemann risked his safety for his Jewish friend.
   ``Werner and I would occasionally meet in the park after dark,
where he would tell me about school. It was dangerous for him, but
it meant a lot to me. He was my one connection to the community.
Otherwise, we were outcasts,'' Wiener said.
   Wiener said he wants to visit his hometown, the site of the
Protestant Reformation, where only a dozen Jewish families lived
when Wiener's family owned a shoe factory there. But Wiener
admitted, ``I don't know if I could handle it.''
   ``I've had a lot of therapy, which is why I have a fairly normal
life. I had to do a lot of work to deal with the leftovers of my
childhood. When you go to survivors' groups, you see a lot of sad
faces.''
   Wiener has traveled to West Germany on legal business but never
tried to cross the border into East Germany.
   ``I felt my past was lost. When people said, `Why don't you go
back,' my answer would be, `I don't know anybody there anymore. They
would all be strangers,''' he said.
   Wiener left Germany by boat in February 1939, one of the lucky
children allowed to go without his parents on a special
``Kindertransport'' to England. His mother _ and his father, who was
sent to a concentration camp for several months _ made their way to
the United States later, before the Nazis closed the gates to Jewish
emigration.
   In his letters, Lindemann went into great detail on his own life:
drafted at 15 into the Germany Army, six months in a French prisoner
of war camp, a stint as a teacher, a career as a government doctor,
a kidney illness that has left him with a decent government pension.
   Lindemann has found another link to Wiener's past: Wolfgang
Senst, Wiener's best childhood friend before he went along with peer
pressure and joined the Hitler youth group.
   ``Wolfgang is now working for the Wittenberg Institute for
Research into Persecution of the Jews,'' Wiener said, relaying
information from Lindemann. ``Werner said he didn't give him my
address because he didn't know if it was okay with me. I will write
him back and say I want to get in touch.''

   Talk about disposable income. On Saturday,
sanitation workers found yet another bundle of money in the garbage,
the latest in a rash of trashed cash.
   Workers sorting garbage at a trash-processing center in Nara
prefecture in western Japan found $7,000 in a briefcase, a local
police official said on condition of anonymity.
   No identification was found on the briefcase, and police do not
know how the money got into the garbage.
   On Thursday, garbage collectors found $8,700 in a pile of trash
in a residential section of Tokyo, police said.
   Authorities said they did not know who left that money either.
   In April, more than $1.4 million was discovered in a bamboo grove
south of Tokyo.
   A businessman, Kazuyasu Noguchi, said he made the money from
trading rare postage stamps and hid it to avoid a tax investigation.
The money was returned to him.

   Japan, a crowded country with no tradition of
welcoming immigrants, has since the early 1980s granted safe harbor
to all Vietnamese boat people. But now it finds itself overwhelmed.
   ``We are considering whether we should change our policy and
introduce screening,'' said Toshio Tsunozaki, director of the
Foreign Ministry's human rights and refugee division. ``But of
course the biggest problem that arises from screening is what to do
with the screened-out.''
   Unlike other countries, Japan has no screening process to
distinguish between those fleeing Vietnam for political reasons and
those who simply want a chance for economic security.
   Vietnam says it will not accept those forced to return home.
   The boat people, turned away from the shores of their already
inundated Southeast Asian neighbors, have begun to navigate a
perilous route 1,900 miles across the East China Sea to southern
Japan.
   But with 1,422 refugees so far this year, compared to 219 during
all of 1988, Japan says it can no longer handle the flow.
   The country's only refugee reception center, at Omura in Nagasaki
prefecture, already was at double its capacity with 415 refugees
when 137 more arrived in the nearby Goto Islands on Monday.
   ``It is impossible to receive any more,'' said Hisao Nishino,
deputy director of the Omura Refugee Reception Center.
   ``It's just too much, and the government should do something
about it right now,'' he said.
   In the latest arrival, a coast guard ship carrying 188 boat
people was to arrive in Naha on the southern Japanese island of
Okinawa on Sunday morning, officials said.
   Hong Kong, flooded with about 52,000 Indochinese refugees, is
trying to persuade economic refugees to return home. About 150 have
gone voluntarily, and the British colony is considering forcible
repatriation if the bottleneck continues.
   Japan is affluent, but unlike immigrant nations such as the
United States, Australia and Canada, it is very crowded and not
accustomed to accepting immigrants.
   ``The Indochinese are the first people to be accepted
systematically into Japan,'' said Chikako Saito, of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Tokyo. ``Japan has
geographical limitations, but as a member of the international
community, it realizes it must share the burden.''
   The U.N. agency estimates 2 million people have fled Indochina
since 1975.
   Most of the recent arrivals here braved bands of pirates who are
believed to have killed several hundred boat people in the South
China Sea this year.
   Pho Van Son, 34, the leader of a group of 151 who left northern
Vietnam on a 60-ton boat, said he decided to aim for Japan after he
heard on short-wave radio that Japan accepts refugees.
   The 20-day journey, calling at Chinese ports for food and
anchoring at small islands for shelter from stormy weather, was
difficult, he said. Also difficult, he said, was the discrimination
at home because of his Chinese blood.
   ``Now,'' Son said after two days at Omura, ``all the difficulty
has passed.''
   He and his companions want to resettle in Japan. A poor farmer
from Hong Gai, Son says he doesn't know what he will do here but
expects the Japanese will find jobs for him and his family.
   ``Most of the refugees arriving here now don't know much about
Japan,'' said Saito. ``They were headed anywhere. They just wanted
to get out of Vietnam.''
   At the camp, the refugees wear clean T-shirts, shorts and sandals
and look surprisingly healthy. They take Japanese and English
classes, eat Japanese food and write letters to relatives, some of
whom fled Vietnam ahead of them and have settled in such places as
the United States and Australia.
   Their 9-by-12-foot rooms, with floors covered in tatami mats, are
crowded with up to six people. Laundry is strung across the rooms
and graffitti is scrawled on many of the walls.
   Above a framed picture of the American oil tanker that rescued
them in the South China Sea, Loi Nguyen Hong, 44, and his son, Chau
Nguyen Hong, 18, have written ``This American ship saved us from
death.''
   On another wall is written ``liberty.'' Nearby, the word
``communism'' is crossed out with red paint.
   Hong displayed a photo album with pictures of his brother, a
Vietnamese translator, and sister-in-law who live in Amarillo,
Texas. Hong hopes his brother can sponsor him and his son to
resettle in the United States.
   Hong's friend, Hung Nguyen, 32, planned to present a petition to
the staff asking for the refugees from southern Vietnam to be
segregated from the northern people.
   ``We risked our lives to escape communism and to get here, and we
don't want to live in the same place as them,'' said Nguyen, who
used to teach English in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Nguyen bears no ill will toward the northern Vietnamese, but
thinks he must make clear he is a political refugee to win
resettlement in the United States, where already about 800,000
Indochinese refugees have settled.
   Japan has resettled 6,257 Vietnamese since the early 1980s. In
June it pledged to accept 1,000 more over the next three years, but
that plan would be already out of date if most of the 1,400-plus who
have arrived this year were to remain in Japan.
   In 1986 Japan said it was willing to take a total of 10,000
refugees from Indochina.

<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski today
nominated Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister
in a move that will end the Communist Party's 45-year grip on
government power.
   ``The president thinks that the formation of such a government
will be conducive to expeditiously overcoming economic difficulties
... and satisfying the needs and aspirations of Polish society,''
the official news agency said.
   Moments earlier, the PAP news agency announced that Jaruzelski
had accepted the resignation of communist Prime Minister Czeslaw
Kiszczak, who was unable to form a government in the face of
opposition from the Solidarity labor movement.
   PAP said Jaruzelski would soon forward the nomination of
Mazowiecki, a former political prisoner with close ties to
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, to the speaker of the Sejm, the lower
house of parliament.
   Mazowiecki, 62, said Friday he was prepared to accept the
premiership. He was reported by an associate to be resting today
outside of Warsaw.
   The Sejm must now elect Mazowiecki. A parliamentary majority put
together by Solidarity and two minor parties _ the United Peasant
Party and the Democratic Party _ assures Mazowiecki's election.
   Even with a non-communist coalition in charge of the government,
the Communists will continue to wield great influence. As president,
Jaruzelski oversees military and foreign policy. Party members fill
the government and courts.
   Solidarity, mindful of the Soviet Union's strategic concerns, has
said it will let the Communist Party retain control of the
ministries of defense and interior, which oversee the army and
police.
   Mazowiecki was described by PAP as a ``longtime Catholic activist
and former Sejm deputy,'' one of the leading activists of Solidarity
and the editor of its weekly newspaper, Tygodnik Solidarnosc.
   ``In the present situation, the president sees a need to create a
government enjoying the necessary support of parliamentary floor
groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between
Poland's political and social forces,'' PAP said.
   The announcement came as the communist Central Committee was
meeting in Warsaw and Walesa was meeting with union leadership in
Gdansk.
   A presidential spokesman said there was ``some division'' within
the committee concerning the historic change but that members were
expected to back the plan. The policy-making body's approval
appeared necessary for the changes to work because the party
controls the powerful bureaucracies that run Poland.
   Pope John Paul II, traveling in Spain, today praised the recent
developments, calling them ``very important, a step forward.'' The
Polish-born pope is an old friend of Mazowiecki.
   On Friday, the powerful Warsaw branch of the Communist Party
argued for a non-political ``government of experts'' _ an apparent
last-minute bid to keep the government from falling under
Solidarity's control.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Friday that
President Bush would have no comment on the selection of a new prime
minister until the parliamentary process is completed. Bush was not
considering expanding the $119 million economic aid package he has
announced for Poland, Fitzwater said.
   Walesa opened a meeting today at Solidarity national headquarters
in Gdansk, where some union members were wary about the communist's
reaction to the expected government changeover.
   ``The PZPR (party) of course will defend itself. It will begin to
start provocations. For the party, the greater disorder that there
is, the better, because we are appealing for calm,'' said Alojzy
Pietrzyk, a Solidarity official from the southern coal fields of
Jastrzebie.
   Mazowiecki's nomination caps a dramatic comeback for the veteran
activist, who spent a year in jail during Jaruzelski's martial law
crackdown of 1981.
   As prime minister, he would lead a country with an economy
crippled by a $39 billion foreign debt, food shortages and
widespread public discontent.
   He would be given several weeks to assemble a Cabinet and present
it to the Sejm for a vote.
   A Solidarity-led government would be of historic significance
because it would be the first government in the Soviet bloc not
under the control of the communists since Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin consolidated control of Eastern Europe in the late 1940s.
   The Soviet government daily Izvestia said Friday it is clear that
Poland is headed for its first non-communist government in decades.
   Perhaps to reassure Soviets there would be some continuity,
Izvestia also ran excerpts from an interview Walesa gave to West
German TV in which he said Poland would remain in the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   Mazowiecki, a Catholic journalist trained as a lawyer, was at
Walesa's side when nationwide strikes last year served as the
catalyst for the government's decision to open talks with the union,
legalize it and allow opposition participation in lections.
   Those elections resulted in Solidarity's victory in virtually
every race its candidates entered.
   Mazowiecki was editor of a Catholic monthly from 1958 until 1981
when he founded Tygodnik Solidarnosc. It was banned under martial
law but resurrected this year after Solidarity was legalized.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are studying the
activities and finances of Lucille Bloch in search of evidence that
could be used in the case being developed against her husband, spy
suspect Felix Bloch, sources say.
   Mrs. Bloch has taken a leave of absence from her job as executive
director of the American Austrian Foundation, a group dedicated to
improving U.S.-Austrian relations. Bloch was the No. 2 diplomat at
the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to 1986.
   Sources familiar with the case say Mrs. Bloch is not suspected of
any wrongdoing or of being an accomplice. But in the hunt for any
motive or evidence of espionage by Bloch, investigators are looking
for signs of unexplained wealth or unusual trips which often
accompany spy cases, said the sources, who spoke on condition they
not be identified.
   Bloch, 54, has not been charged with any crime, but was placed on
paid leave by the State Department in June.
   About two weeks ago, Mrs. Bloch asked the foundation, which
receives money from the Austrian foreign ministry, for a leave of
absence for an indefinite period, said Thomas McGrath, a New York
attorney who serves as the group's secretary.
   Mrs. Bloch made the decision on her own, and was not prodded by
officials of the tax-deductible foundation, he said.
   Several of Mrs. Bloch's friends described her as distraught over
the investigation of her husband.
   While Bloch has remained at the couple's apartment in Washington,
Mrs. Bloch has stayed with relatives in New York, according to her
friends. Her office in Washington, a room she rents from another
consultant, is staffed by a secretary. Mrs. Bloch could not be
reached for comment.
   She told a newspaper in Vienna last month, ``We are all very
affected and in these difficult times we stand behind him.''
   Mrs. Bloch, whom McGrath said was a spectacular and ``very
hard-working'' employee, was hired as the foundation's executive
director in 1988, according to forms on file with the New York
secretary of state's office in Albany, N.Y. She was paid $24,375
last year.
   The foundation was set up in 1984 ``to promote, develop and
support cultural, scientific, scholarly and intellectual relations''
between the United States and Austria, its brochure says.
   A host of famous people are associated with the group including
director Billy Wilder, a trustee; former Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and David Rockefeller, honorary trustees, and conductor
Leonard Bernstein, an advisory council member.
   Although McGrath said the foundation has no official relationship
with the Austrian government, records show the group received a
$39,370 grant from the Austrian Foreign Ministry in 1988.
   The Austrian foreign minister, Alois Mock, is a good friend of
the Blochs' from their graduate school days in the 1950s. They met
at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in
Bologna, Italy.
   Last June, Mrs. Bloch stayed at Mock's home in Vienna and
attended a dinner party there, a guest told The Washington Post. And
last year, Mrs. Bloch's foundation hosted a $1,653 luncheon for
Mock, records show.
   Altogether in 1988, the foundation collected $167,414, of which
$120,982 came from corporate and other business grants.
   Philipp Hoyos, a political minister at the Austrian Embassy, said
his country channelled some ``seed money'' to the foundation when it
was established. Since then, the government has helped the
foundation with its projects, he said.
   Despite the foundation's good intentions, Hoyos said, the group
has not had as much success in fund-raising as some thought
initially.
   McGrath said he hoped the foundation would not be unfairly
tarnished by the Bloch affair, but acknowledged the group might be
put in a ``defensive posture'' because of the publicity.

   A farm town that consists of two bars, a
grain elevator, a church, baseball field and 70 people can now boast
it's the smallest place Johnny Cash ever played.
   Cash took the stage in the alfalfa field behind the County Line
Bar on Friday night before nearly 5,000 people, just about all of
them from out of town.
   ``Twenty years ago, they had Woodstock. Welcome to Cornstalk,''
the singer kwown for such hits as ``I Walk the Line'' and ``A Boy
Named Sue'' told the mass of fans, many sitting in lawn chairs and
sporting caps emblazoned with feed company logos.
   Mike Kampsen, 33, organized the concert in part to please his
father, Herman, a longtime Cash fan who sings with a local band
called Country Cruisin'.
   The elder Kampsen, a 65-year-old farmer, got to sing a couple of
songs with the Man in Black.
   ``I've liked him since, it seems like when I was a kid,'' Herman
Kampsen said. ``I guess I like him because he was a poor man at one
time. He sings songs about poor people. Like us.''
   Cash's wife, June Carter Cash, opened the show at 8 p.m., and
Cash took the stage an hour later. Daughter Cindy Cash and Carter
sisters Helen and Anita also performed.
   Cash, a severe cold draining his voice, struggled through
versions of ``Folsom Prison Blues,'' ``Ring of Fire,'' ``Orange
Blossom Special'' and other old favorites, plus a series of gospel
songs during his 75-minute performance.
   ``I've been getting fan mail from Europe from people asking
`Where's Regal? We can't find it on the map,''' Cash said. And he
said he and his family had been looking forward to the Regal show
more than any other concert date on this year's schedule.
   Cash's manager, Lou Robin, confirmed that Regal, about 100 miles
northwest of Minneapolis, was the smallest town the singer ever
played.
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' said Pat Beirer of Regal.
   Kaye Stein of Kimball said she brought her husband, Paul, who had
never been to a concert before. She called Cash ``the most human of
all the country-western singers.''
   Mike Kampsen said earlier he needed to sell 3,500 tickets at $20
to $30 each to break even on the show. Diane Hoffenkamp, who handled
concert publicity, said 4,800 tickets were sold.
   Kampsen borrowed money from a bank to make the up-front payment
to Cash, but wouldn't say how much he paid the singer.
   ``The banker thought I was kind of nuts, but he gave me the money
anyway,'' he said.
   Dave Johnson and about 40 others came from Fargo, N.D., on a bus
provided by a local radio station.
   ``We're just a bunch of country hicks who like Johnny Cash,''
Johnson said. ``About a week ago, we heard about it and said `Gee,
we ought to go, we're done with harvest.' But we didn't know where
it was. We had a 1970 atlas and we couldn't find Regal.''

   Jim Bakker created the celebrity-filled
world he had always wanted at the PTL ministry, but lost it by
surrounding himself with advisers who fed his need to be the star of
the show, a new book says.
   Bakker, who was driven from the now-defunct PTL ministry more
than two years ago in the midst of a sex-and-money scandal, goes on
trial Monday on federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Jury selection
begins Monday; opening arguments are expected a week later.
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, another television evangelist, took over
the PTL ministry in March 1987 as a caretaker under an agreement
with Bakker. But Falwell put the ministry under bankruptcy
protection three months later after uncovering a spreading web of
alleged financial irregularities and millions of dollars in unpaid
bills.
   Bakker ``survived at PTL by creating a universe where right and
wrong were relative; he wrote the rules, and if he needed to break
one, he found reason to rewrite or ignore it,'' Charles Shepard, a
Charlotte Observer reporter, writes in his new book. ``Falwell
brought to PTL a set of absolute standards _ a crucible Bakker could
not survive.''
   Shepard's coverage of PTL from 1984 to 1987 led to Bakker's
resignation and a Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper. His book,
``Forgiven _ The Rise and Fall of Jim Bakker and The PTL Ministry,''
is scheduled to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press in
mid-September.
   The book portrays Bakker as a boyish charmer whose classmates in
his hometown of Muskegon, Mich., believed was destined for a career
in show business.
   He enrolled in Bible school in Minneapolis, but dropped out after
less than two years when he married his wife, Tammy, and decided to
become a traveling evangelist.
   A chance to do a Christian children's television show led the
Bakkers to Pat Robertson's fledgling Christian Broadcasting Network
and, eventually, to Charlotte in 1974, where Bakker used his gift
for fund-raising to turn a failing television station and a
storefront studio into a satellite network and the Heritage USA
theme park in neary Fort Mill, S.C.
   As PTL grew, Bakker surrounded himself with aides willing to tell
him what he wanted to hear, ministry insiders told Shepard.
Executives who worried about Bakker's spontaneous on-camera
decisions to finance projects, or questioned the funding for giant
building projects at Heritage USA, suddenly found themselves out of
favor, if not out of a job.
   Contractors for the water park at Heritage USA ran into the PTL
philosophy when they asked why the ministry hadn't done a study to
determine what size the park should be and how much admission to
charge.
   ``They were told not to press the subject; Bakker got his
inspiration from God, and that was sufficient cause for PTL to move
ahead,'' Shephard wrote. ``PTL seemed confident that the audience
for Bakker's TV program, the stream of visitors to Heritage USA, and
the lifetime partners would generate the necessary traffic.''
   Lifetime partners were investors in the park.
   Two of Bakker's former aides, brothers James and David Taggart,
have been convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million in ministry
funds they diverted to their own uses, including Cartier jewelry,
designer clothes and a Manhattan apartment. Scheduled for sentencing
Friday, they each face maximum terms of 25 years in prison and $1
million in fines.
   Richard M. Dortch, Bakker's top assistant at PTL, pleaded guilty
earlier this month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud. He has
agreed to testify against his former boss as part of a plea bargain,
said Bill Diehl, Dortch's attorney.
   The Taggarts will consider testifying against Bakker, said their
attorney, Ben Cotten.
   The book details some of the transactions that form the basis of
the charges, saying Bakker and Dortch arranged bonuses for
themselves to cover such personal expenses as the Bakkers' three
homes.
   Prosecutors allege that Bakker pocketed some of the $158 million
that poured into PTL from 1984 to 1987 under various ``lifetime
partnership'' programs. In eight of the 11 programs, contributors
were promised free lodging at Heritage USA in exchange for a
one-time donation of $1,000 or more.
   Instead of using all of the money to build hotels and other
facilities at Heritage USA to serve the partners, the indictment
said, the PTL executives spent more than $4 million on themselves
and used some of it for operating expenses.
   Jim and Tammy Bakker got nearly $3.5 million in bonuses from 1984
through 1987 and Dortch got $550,000 in bonuses while withholding
informaton about PTL's worsening financial problems from its board
of directors, the indictment charged. Mrs. Bakker was not charged.
   Bakker, who was listed among those interviewed for the book, has
denied the charges against him but has declined to speak further
with reporters.
   Bakker resigned in March 1987 after being informed by The
Charlotte Observer that the newspaper was ready to publish a story
of a sexual liaison between former New York church secretary Jessica
Hahn and Bakker in Florida in 1980.

<HEAD>Chinese Defense Minister Reappears After Reports of His Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's defense minister appeared on national
television Saturday despite reports that he was arrested in a power
struggle with the President Yang Shangkun.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping has been reported to be ill with
cancer, and Chinese sources say his poor condition has touched off a
power struggle between Defense Minister Qin Jiwei and Yang. Deng
turns 85 on Tuesday.
   The sources had said troops loyal to Yang led Qin from his
Beijing home on Wednesday after the two argued about which of them
should be promoted to first vice chairman of the powerful Central
Military Commission.
   Some sources said Qin had been placed under house arrest, but the
television appearance seemed to rule that out.
   The position of first vice chairman was held by former Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang until he was stripped of all power in June
during a purge resulting from the pro-democracy protests.
   Yang led the crackdown that crushed the protests, while Qin was
believed to oppose it.
   Qin, 75, was shown briefly Saturday in a news report on the
funeral of Fu Zhong, a legislator and former colonel-general. The
report did not identify him by name, but a later report by the
official Xinhua News Agency listed him among the top officials
attending.
   Some Chinese sources say Yang, 81, and Qin are jockeying for
control of the army. The first vice chairman of the Military
Commission ranks second only to Deng, who is chairman.
   Yang now holds the separate, lower posts of permanent vice
president and secretary general of the commission.
   Qin has been defense minister since April 1988. However, the
Military Commission, rather than the Defense Ministry, long has been
the real decision-maker in military affairs.
   A Western diplomat said, however, the struggle goes even deeper.
   ``The general consensus here is that it's the top post, Deng's
position, that is at stake,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   The Defense Ministry denied to foreign reporters Friday that Qin
was arrested or ousted as defense minister. However, it did not
specifically deny he was detained by troops on Yang's orders.
   A source in Hong Kong said Yang met Friday with top military
commanders to discuss his appointment as first vice chairman but
that the commanders did not express support.
   The source said Deng's health is deteriorating rapidly. Military
commanders who visited him this week found he could not speak, the
source said. He said his information came from the wife of one
commander and secretary of another.
   The Western diplomat said regional military commanders were
opposing Yang's moves because of his extensive family connections in
the military.
   Yang belongs to one of the strongest military families in China.
His younger brother, Yang Baibing, is director of the army's General
Political Department. His son-in-law, Chi Haotian, runs the
headquarters of the army's General Staff.
   But the Chinese source in Hong Kong said Yang had obtained the
support of some elderly retired conservatives and Vice President
Wang Zhen.
   In another development Saturday, a source at the Australian
Embassy said it had sheltered for more than two months a folk singer
who was active in the pro-democracy movement.
   The singer, 33-year-old Hou Dejian, returned to his home in
Beijing on Wednesday, and official television showed him chatting
with reporters the next day about the military assault on Beijing
pro-democracy protesters on June 3-4.
   Hou, who helped negotiate safe passage of protesters out of
Tiananmen Square, gave the official version of the crackdown in his
comments.
   ``I didn't see that anyone was shot. There was no such thing as
tanks crushing (people),'' he said.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed when
government troops pushed toward the square to sweep out protesters.
   The Australian embassy source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Hou appoved of the conditions of his release to
Chinese authorities.
   The source suggested Chinese authorities ``leaned on him'' to
make his statements on television.

<HEAD>US Bars Cuban Pianist From New York Latin Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department confirmed Saturday it has
rejected a visa request from a top Cuban pianist and his band to
play at a Latin arts festival in New York, a decision termed
``shortsighted, outdated and whimsical'' by the show's producer.
   The pianist, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, and his band, Grupo Proyecto,
were scheduled to appear with jazz great Dizzy Gillespie in an
open-air concert in Central Park on Monday, a free event which
traditionally highlights the annual Festival Latino.
   Gillespie has called Rubalcaba ``the greatest pianist I've heard
in the last 10 years'' and had sought him for the New York show.
   However, the State Department turned down the visa request under
terms of a 1985 proclamation by then-President Reagan ``which found
unrestricted entry of Cuban government employees to be detrimental
to the interests of the United States,'' according to spokeswoman
Sondra McCarty.
   Almost all Cuban artists are paid by their government.
   New York producer Joseph Papp, whose Public Threatre organizes
the Latin arts festival, called the department's decision
``shortsighted, outdated and whimsical. ... It is counterproductive
and ends up as an attack against artists whose presence poses no
threat to national security.''
   Papp noted that three Cuban filmmakers were granted visas to
participate in the same festival. In a letter to Assistant Secretary
of State Bernard Aronson, he wrote, ``When you seem to have no
problem granting visas to three Cuban fimmakers and deny eight
musicians entry, the rationale seems strained.''
   Ms. McCarty could not explain the apparent discrepancy in the way
the requests were handled, other than to say ``waivers are
occasionally granted. However, we determined that waivers were not
appropriate in the case of Grupo Proyecto.''
   Rubalcaba and Gillespie met when the trumpeter played at Cuba's
Jazz Plaza festival in 1985. The American jazz artist invited the
pianist to perform with him in the film ``A Night in Havana,'' which
documented Gillespie's visit to Cuba.

<HEAD>Despite Caution, U.S. Spearheading Relief Effort for Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the Bush administration is reacting with
caution to Poland's decision to form a non-communist government,
efforts are ongoing to provide its faltering economy with nearly $1
billion of relief.
   ``The State Department doesn't dance in the streets, I'm sorry,''
said department spokesman Richard Boucher, reflecting the restrained
official U.S. reaction to a week of momentous events.
   Despite the nomination Saturday of Solidarity trade union
activist Tadeuz Mazowiecki to be Poland's first non-communist prime
minister in more than four decades, U.S. officials said Warsaw
should expect no further increases in direct U.S. aid.
   ``We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as
appropriate and as we can,'' presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters at the summer White House in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   Behind the austere facade, however, the United States is pushing
a multinational effort to provide Poland with nearly $1 billion in
extra cash this year by pressuring Western banks and governments to
reschedule the $39 billion debt it owes.
   The multilateral steps also include World Bank decisions, with
U.S. impetus, ``to move forward with two economically viable project
loans, one on industrial development and one on agricultural
development, which total $325 million,'' said Boucher.
   That effort doesn't begin to approach the $10 billion in Western
help that Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa sought in a meeting with
President Bush last month in Poland. But it is a start.
   Bush told Walesa then that he could provide only $119 million in
direct U.S. aid. Capitol Hill sources this week predicted Congress
will approve the $119 million but is unlikely to increase it.
   ``The fact is that bilateral aid is not what the Poles need. It
is splashy and cheers them on, but they really need multilateral
aid, help on their debt,'' said an aide to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   Rostenkowski has been one of the most ardent congressional
advocates of helping Poland and has advised Bush to take the
multilateral road.
   ``There is a very real limit on the amount of aid that the United
States can provide'' because of its own budget deficits, said the
Rostenskowski aide, who spoke on condition he not be further
identified.
   Bush's $119 million aid package is tailored to accelerating the
collapse of socialism in Poland. It earmarks $100 million over three
years to create and run a Polish-American Enterprise Fund that will
channel low-cost loans to Poles trying to start capitalist
enterprises.
   The package also includes 16,000 tons of food this year and an
additional $50 million worth in 1990, as well as $15 million to
clean up air and water pollution in Krakow, the ancient Polish
capital.
   While the United States maintains that its own financial problems
preclude additional help for Poland, political considerations also
are behind the restrained reaction to the events there this week.
   ``It's too early at this point to know how they (Poland's
leaders) are going to make it work, let alone how it will work,''
said Fitzwater.
   U.S. conservatives were uncomfortable with Walesa's assurances to
Moscow that Communists will retain sensitive cabinet posts
controlling the armed forces and the police under the Solidarity-led
government and the Poland will not leave the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
military alliance.
   Key among them is Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who as the
ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has
the potential power to hamper any aid package.
   Helms opposes spending more money on Poland until it breaks with
the Warsaw Pact or dismantles its communist system, said an aide to
him.
   ``A great deal of glasnost, as far as the Soviet Union is
concerned, is for the West to subsidize the failure of the communist
system,'' said the aide, Tom Boney. ``We certainly want to wait
until there has been a divorce from communism before we commit U.S.
taxpayer dollars.''

<HEAD>Former Cop Gets 10 Years for Civil Rights Violation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police officer who forced a woman to
perform a sex act by threatening to have her put in jail was
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   State District Judge Norman Lanford gave the maximum term Friday
to Frederick Hoy Abbott, 42, for violating the civil rights of a
27-year-old widow he stopped on a highway last year on a possible
drinking offense.
   The sentenced followed widespread public outcry this month when
another former officer was initially given probation in a similar
incident.
   Abbott planned to appeal.
   Lanford said a probationary sentence would have infuriated some
people while a prison term likely would anger others.
   ``Politically, there's no right solution,'' Lanford said. ``I'm
going to do what a judge is paid to do.''
   Earlier this month, another former Houston officer, James Cebula,
29, was granted 10-year probation by a jury that convicted him of
raping an intoxicated woman he purportedly had arrested.
   The probation was widely criticized, and state District Judge
Lupe Salinas subsequently imposed a lengthy list of probationary
conditions, including a 120-day jail stay.
   Character witnesses and Abbott's lawyer, William McQuillen, had
asked Lanford not to imprison Abbott. McQuillen said Abbott's ``bad
side'' had been exorcised when he was fired over the case.
   Abbott stopped the victim at 2:30 a.m. on Feb. 9, 1988, soon
after she left a bar.
   The woman testified Abbott told her she would be taken to jail
where she would risk being abused by lesbian prisoners. She said
Abbott asked her what she might be willing to do to avoid arrest.
   When she asked if he was soliciting money, Abbott named the
specific sex act she could perform to avert a trip to jail.
   ``He kept harping on her,'' prosecutor Don Smyth said. ``He kept
driving around and telling her: `You're going to go to jail. There
are a lot of mean women there.'''
   Smyth said the woman began submitting but balked again when
Abbott began undressing. Smyth said Abbott then forced her to comply.

<HEAD>Pentagon Pushing to Cut Down on Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is quietly moving ahead with a
plan to wean bureaucrats, battleships and bombers from unwieldy
stacks of printed paperwork and convert them to compact,
cost-effective computer disks.
   The effort comes in response to a weighty problem: a modern Navy
warship carries 15 to 25 tons of operating, maintenance and repair
manuals; the B-1B bomber has generated 1 million pages of how-to
documentation.
   The Pentagon says the campaign could reduce the lifetime cost of
major weapons by up to 20 percent by converting masses of printed
technical information into computerized databases.
   The cost for technical data delivered with military hardware
ranges from 10 percent to 30 percent of the total weapon system
price tag. Add to that the millions of dollars that must be spent,
year after year, to keep the manuals up to date.
   To spearhead the conversion of printed data to electronic form,
the Defense Department in September 1985 launched a program called
Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support, or CALS.
   Bruce Lepisto, deputy director of the Pentagon's CALS Policy
Office, said each of the military services has selected particular
weapons to lead the way in carrying out the computerization effort.
   For the Air Force, he said, these lead systems are the Advanced
Tactical Fighter and the B-2 Stealth bomber; for the Navy, the A-12
attack aircraft and SSN-21 Seawolf class attack submarine; and for
the Army, the LHX helicopter and M1-A2 tank.
   Lepisto acknowledged that there had been some problem weaning
military personnel as well as defense contractors from reliance on
traditional paper documents.
   ``We're talking about a major cultural change here,'' he said.
``Some people are overly anxious and want to rush in. And some
people feel that better is the enemy of good enough. What we're
implementing is a new way of doing business. And certainly there are
going to be people that want to go either faster or slower.''
   Paul N. Pechersky, co-chairman of the CALS Industry Steering
Group, representing hundreds of defense contractors, said, ``We're
still in the very early stages. This is a massive undertaking. From
my own personal perspective, I think we're doing very well.''
   ``The first several years have been devoted to trying to get our
act together _ to decide what we want to do and how we want to do
it. And more importantly, to try and get agreement on some of the
early digital (information) exchange standards that have to be put
in place,'' he said.
   Pechersky, corporate director of management information systems
for E-Systems Inc. in Dallas, said the program is ``evolutionary,
not revolutionary. We'll see various implementations of CALS well
into the year 2000.''
   The CALS program involves development of standardized text and
image formats so that electronic data can be readily exchanged
between a wide variety of different computer systems within the
military and at defense contractors.
   The Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, a publishing industry
newsletter based in Media, Pa., has forecast that CALS eventually
will have a major impact spreading far beyond the defense industry.
   Peter Dyson, associate editor of the newsletter, observed that
``the Defense Department handles so much printing and so much
electronic information that they are the classic 800-pound gorilla.
Whatever they do sets a standard.''
   ``Every aspect of the publishing industry is coming to grips with
this electronic dissemination of information,'' he said. ``And
they're sort of mucking around, not quite knowing how to do it,
because it's still a difficult technology.
   ``What the Defense Department has done is simply issued a fiat,
`This is how you shall do it.' Having said so, they're going to make
it so. Large other chunks of the industry are going to go that way
simply because the vendors of electronic systems will have already
written the software to do it for DoD,'' Dyson said.

   Better late than never, some say.
   Thirteen years after the United States bicentennial, Coventry is
burying its time capsule containing mementos from 1976.
   Town Council President James J. Kiley plans to bury a time
capsule Monday containing such items as a list of the winners of a
bicentennial fire-hydrant painting contest and a copy of The
Providence Journal-Bulletin from 1976.
   The idea of a time capsule had been discussed since the country's
bicentennial, but the plan was only pulled together this summer.
   Kiley decided the time was ripe, since Aug. 21 is the 248th
anniversary of the town's incorporation.
   The plastic capsule, about 10 inches in diameter, also holds
artifacts from Coventry's founding, including the Coventry flag and
greetings from people in the town's namesake in England.

<TEXT>
   Leona Helmsley may consider herself the queen of
hotels, but she's discovered her sovereignty is not recognized in
the court of law.
   For six weeks, prosecution witnesses at her trial on a 47-count
federal indictment have portrayed Mrs. Helmsley as an abusive boss
who evaded taxes by charging personal expenses to her business,
extorted kickbacks from liquor suppliers and didn't pay her bills.
   Even her lawyer conceded she was ``demanding'' and ``abrasive.''
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69 _ who with her husband, Harry, heads a $5
billion real estate empire _ has said not a word publicly about the
stories of greed and arrogance presented by the prosecution, which
rested its case Tuesday after presenting 44 witnesses and thousands
of pages of documents.
   Through it all, Mrs. Helmsley has done her best to remain remote
and regal. Her head held high, she listened, occasionally jotted
notes and whispered comments to her lawyers.
   Though always fashionably dressed, Mrs. Helmsley has not flaunted
her wealth. She wore tailored suits and simple jewelry like a single
strand of pearls and a gold wedding band.
   Well-trained in courtroom procedure, she often was the first to
rise when the jury entered the room. She would look directly at the
jurors and give them a friendly nod.
   How or if Mrs. Helmsley's courtroom demeanor will affect the
jurors remains to be seen.
   The jurors heard from contractors about their battles to get paid
for renovation work at Mrs. Helmsley's Connecticut estate, Dunnellen
Hall.
   She disputed many bills, negotiated lesser payments and
ultimately had much of the cost, $3.1 million, paid for by
Helmsley-owned businesses, testimony has shown.
   The jurors also will consider a document that claims she charged
more than $320,000 in personal purchases to the Park Lane Hotel.
   These charges ranged from $32 for insect repellent, a $58 ``Itty
Bitty Book Light'' and $60 in undergarments to nearly $3,000 for
cuff links and tens of thousands of dollars in designer clothing.
   The jury also has heard three liquor vendors testify they were
forced by Mrs. Helmsley's top aide, Frank Turco, to pay hefty
kickbacks to keep their accounts at Helmsley hotels.
   In testimony July 25, a former Helmsley executive, Milton
Meckler, said Turco once held up several envelopes and said, ``This
is cash. This is what Mrs. Helmsley wants.''
   But the jurors won't hear Mrs. Helmsley's version of events. Her
lead lawyer, Gerald Feffer, says she will not take the stand. Her
two co-defendants, Turco and another former aide, Joseph Licari,
also will not testify.
   The defense will wrap up the trial next week with testimony from
two audit experts who claim the Helmsleys, rather than evading
$681,000 in taxes, actually are owed refunds.
   Her lawyers say she overpaid taxes for 1983, 1984 and 1985
because she did not properly depreciate a tax-shelter investment.
U.S. District Judge John M. Walker Jr. said Friday that waiting
until the trial was nearly over to make the claim ``smacks of a
desperate need,'' but it will be allowed.
   A key part of the defense is that the Helmsleys used Dunnellen
Hall for business purposes.
   Harry Helmsley, 80, also was charged but was found incompetent to
stand trial.
   Mrs. Helmsley has surrounded herself with lawyers and family
members during breaks in testimony. Security employees escort her to
and from her limousine at the beginning and end of each day.
   She lunches in the courthouse cafeteria. At the beginning of the
trial, she ate the cafeteria food but now is brought sandwiches from
an outside deli.
   While avoiding contact with reporters, she sometimes stops to
chat with the courtroom artists who draw scenes for television and
newspaper reports.
   ``I'll kill myself if I look like that,'' she once joked, as she
looked over an artist's shoulder.
   The judge imposed a gag order preventing lawyers and defendants
from discussing the case with the media and Mrs. Helmsley does not
answer questions from reporters on any subject.
   When an advertising company dropped the Helmsley Hotels account
during the trial, Mrs. Helmsley was asked for comment. She zipped
her lips.
   Mrs. Helmsley's imperious armor has shown some cracks. She became
teary-eyed on several occasions when the death of her son from a
previous marriage came up in testimony.
   She joined in the laughter when Internal Revenue Service agent
John Dennehy read from a document that she had charged a $21 yearly
membership fee for a crossword puzzle club to one of her luxury
hotels.
   And once, she gave a big smile of relief _ when the government
rested.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is unable to enforce
sanctions banning imports of gold and other products from
state-owned enterprises in South Africa because the State Department
has not identified the banned items, congressional watchdogs said
Saturday.
   Without a list of specific products to work from, the U.S.
Customs Service has been largely ineffective in enforcing the import
ban passed by Congress in 1986, the General Accounting Office said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who requested the GAO study,
said it pointed to a ``shocking lapse by top Reagan administration
officials, who failed to apply elementary enforcement procedures in
carrying out the anti-apartheid law.''
   The legislation, which was approved over former President Ronald
Reagan's veto, banned imports of a variety of goods from South
Africa, including products of so-called parastatals _ entities owned
or controlled by the South African government.
   ``The State Department issued a list of South African government
agencies and state-owned corporations that it designated as
parastatals but did not identify the products produced, marketed or
exported by them,'' the GAO said.
   ``Because products associated with parastatals have not been
identified, Customs cannot use trade data, which is kept on a
product-by-product basis, to obtain leads on illegal imports from
parastatals,'' it added.
   While direct U.S. imports of South African gold ceased in 1987,
the bullion could still be entering the United States illegally by
transshipment through Britain and Switzerland, which market much of
South Africa's gold, according to the GAO.
   Between January 1987 and March 1989 British exports of gold to
the United States totaled $175 million and Swiss gold exports to
this country came to $164 million, the watchdogs said.
   ``Because it was not widely known in Customs that gold was under
the parastatal sanction, it could not use data on trade flows to
obtain leads on illegal trade and could not identify possible
transshipment of South African gold to the United States through
third countries,'' the report said.
   As the result of its inquiry, GAO officials said the Customs
agency is now investigating whether some gold from Switzerland and
the United Kingdom is of South African origin and is entering the
United States illegally.

   The civil rights coalition Martin Luther King Jr.
put together more than three decades ago was having a foot-stompin'
good time in Ebenezer Baptist Church last week.
   Marchers from the movement's high time swayed and clapped to
gospel music. Movement royalty _ King's widow, sister and three of
his children _ were on hand for festivities that lasted until
midnight.
   But one person was noticeably absent: Dexter Scott King.
   He called himself ``the son of a son of a movement'' when he
became president of his father's memorial center, but left the
center in a huff four months later amid a reported power struggle
with his mother, Coretta Scott King.
   King, 28, the youngest son, has kept a low profile since his
resignation Aug. 4 from the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change. Neigher he nor his mother responded to
repeated requests for interviews.
   The King Center's directors emerged from a six-hour meeting
Wednesday with a new job for King, but they have not announced what
it is. King has given no indication whether he will accept the job.
   The directors have said the center's presidency will remain
vacant and they consider the matter basically resolved.
   As the Southern Christian Leadership Conference convened here
last week, there were several who identified with Dexter King's
position: that of a young leader who wants his ideas heard in a
movement where the old guard is reluctant to surrender control.
   Among them was U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a leader in the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the 1960s. Lewis,
49, said such power struggles were a problem nearly 30 years ago.
   ``The sit-ins and the Freedom Rides in SNCC were also a revolt
against the old leadership,'' he said. ``What made it different in
that period was we had been provided a role, and a place at the
table.
   ``You cannot take the dream ... to participate, put it in a
bottle and put a cap on it. We should open the doors, make young
people feel welcome.''
   ``One thing about Martin Luther King Jr. _ he welcomed the
involvement of young people,'' Lewis said. ``He praised the vigor
they could bring to a struggle.''
   Civil rights leaders, many of whom have acted as surrogate
fathers to King's children, said they are concerned about Dexter
King's welfare.
   ``I do plan to talk to him,'' said SCLC President Joseph Lowery,
a member of the King Center's board of directors and a longtime King
family friend. ``I think some mistakes were made on both sides.
   ``I think he's amenable to working it out. He loves the center
and I'm sure he wants to be involved in the vital work the center
does.''
   But another King aide, Hosea Williams, said, ``He ain't going
back in there.'' Williams said King left because the center's
leaders, by giving him the role of ``president-in-training,'' showed
they were unwilling to give him power to change things.
   ``They killed the boy's spirit. He sees now how costly it is, how
tough it is to be a true leader,'' Williams said.
   ``They talking about training. What kind of training does he
need?'' Williams asked. ``Old age is the inability to accept change.
And that is just the problem that Dexter ran into.''
   The Rev. Tony Minor, 30, could readily identify with what Dexter
King experienced.
   Minor, the SCLC's youngest chapter president, pulled together a
conference chapter in Cleveland, Ohio, that, after eight months, has
150 members _ mostly people under 35.
   A graduate of Martin Luther King's alma mater, Morehouse College,
Minor spent five years as an aide for Lowery and Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young, learning how to move his ministry into the community
and listening to stories about the movement days.
   Minor said the SCLC has made room at the top for youth before,
and he doesn't mind waiting for his day in the sun.
   ``The challenge is for younger leaders to respect and support
veterans who have been around,'' he said. ``Those veterans should,
in turn, adopt the young leaders, teach them, support them.''
   But Williams said, ``Young leaders must not back up or submit to
old leaders like me.''
   ``They've just got to come up and push old leaders on out of the
way,'' he said. ``Old leaders must realize ... we should voluntarily
allow the young leaders to take over and meet today's challenge.
   ``If we don't do that, then what we have suffered for will
perish.''

<TEXT>
   Syracuse University will select two
students each year from Lockerbie, Scotland, for scholarships to the
school in memory of the 35 Syracuse students who died in a plane
crash near the village in December.
   The first students to receive the one-year full scholarships will
arrive at Syracuse in the fall, Samuel Gorovitz, dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences, said Friday.
   The Lockerbie Scholars program will honor the memory of the 35
Syracuse students and the 11 Lockerbie residents who were among the
270 people killed in the Dec. 21, 1988, crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
Investigators blame a terrorist bomb for the crash of the Boeing 747.
   Two Lockerbie officials _ Drew Blake, principal of Lockerbie
Academy, and Ken Macleod, a regional educational official in
Scotland _ were in Syracuse for the announcement.
   Lockerbie Academy has 800 students ages 12 through 18. One of its
students was killed when Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie. Another
student lost his whole family in the tragedy.
   Students entering their last year at the academy will be eligible
for the scholar program, Blake said. The students will attend
Syracuse for one academic year and then return to enter a university
in Scotland, he said.

   Police used whips and dogs to
disperse hundreds of blacks, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
during mass protests Saturday at two whites-only beaches.
   Tutu was carried shoulder-high onto the first beach targeted by
the demonstrators and later appealed to protesters at the other
beach to leave when he saw them being beaten with whips by police.
   ``We have proved these are God's beaches,'' he said.
   The Black Sash civil rights group said several protesters
sustained open wounds from the whips. The group said its monitors at
the second beach ``watched with horror'' as officers charged
families eating picnic lunches and used a helicopter to blow sand on
them.
   About 15 journalists covering the first protest, at The Strand
beach east of Cape Town, were detained for two hours.
   Nearer to the city, a black constable was killed by a group of
youths, police said.
   According to reports that local newspapers received from a human
rights lawyer, four black civilians also were injured and about 35
people arrested in clashes that broke out when protesters were
stopped from boarding buses to the beach. Those reports could not be
confirmed.
   Learning that The Strand had been sealed off with roadblocks,
several hundred blacks went to Bloubergstrand, a segregated beach
just north of Cape Town.
   Tutu, who had strolled along The Strand beach before he and
fellow demonstrators were dispersed, arrived at Bloubergstrand to
see police whipping protesters.
   Tutu climbed onto the back of a pick-up truck and successfully
persuaded the protesters to withdrew.
   John Allen, Tutu's press aide, said some white onlookers yelled
insults at the archbishop.
   Police also arrested at least 25 anti-apartheid demonstrators in
Durban and Johannesburg, and banned a major rally that had been
called for Sunday in Johannesburg to declare that outlawed
opposition groups were back in operation.
   Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt warned organizers of the
escalating nationwide campaign of defiance that ``lawlessness and
anarchy will not be tolerated.''
   Leaders of the campaign announced several days ago that blacks
would have a picnic Saturday on the segregated white beach at The
Strand.
   Late Friday, police and soldiers cordoned off a three-mile
stretch of whites-only beachfront and erected signs saying the beach
was closed because of a police dog-training exercise. Roadblocks
were erected, and some blacks arriving in buses to join the protest
were turned back.
   But Tutu and about 300 other protesters reached the beach area,
and the archbishop was carried onto the sand on the shoulders of
some of the crowd before they were dispersed by police equipped with
whips and guard dogs.
   Some of the group then went to a neighboring town, Gordon's Bay,
where Tutu, leader of South Africa's Anglican Church, held an
impromptu news conference.
   ``It is incredible that the government is prepared to use arms on
people who wish to have a picnic,'' he said. ``Instead of getting
rid of beach apartheid, they protect it with policemen, dogs and
guns.''
   The detained journalists, many of them representing U.S. and
British news organizations, were allowed to go free after film and
videotapes were confiscated. Police said the journalists had failed
to obey an order to leave the area.
   In the port city of Durban, 16 activists were arrested as they
stood outside a beachfront hotel protesting the presence of an
international all-star rugby team. The team's five-match tour to
South Africa has been approved by international rugby officials, but
militants have depicted the visit as a breach of the sports boycott
imposed to protest apartheid.
   Police said nine people were arrested in downtown Johannesburg
after scores of blacks chanted in the streets during a protest
against the arrest Friday of anti-apartheid activist Mohammed Valli
Moosa. Several demonstrators carried placards with the initials of
the United Democratic Front, which was banned last year.
   Organizers of the defiance campaign had planned several rallies
on Sunday to proclaim that the anti-apartheid coalition had
``unbanned'' itself. One rally has been banned and similar action
was expected against the others.
   The campaign began Aug. 3, when blacks sought treatment at white
hospitals, and has spread as the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections
approach. The state radio Saturday said police must ``respond
imaginatively'' in order to counter civil disobedience without
triggering violence.

<TEXT>
   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah on
Saturday accused the United States, France and Pope John Paul II of
favoring Lebanese Christians over Moslems and hinted that new
attacks may be mounted on U.S. targets.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, Syria's main Lebanese ally, ordered
a general mobilization in his 200,000-member Druse community to
prepare for a major battle against the Christians, Moslem sources
said.
   Police said two people were killed and nine wounded in clashes
between Syrian troops and Christian forces along Beirut's
Christian-Moslem dividing line and three other fronts in the central
Lebanese mountains and in north Lebanon.
   The new casualties raised the overall toll to 781 killed and
2,118 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between Gen. Michel
Aoun's mainly Christian army units and Syrian troops backed by
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.
   Spradic exchanges have broken a general lull prevailing since the
U.N. Security Council appealed Tuesday for a cease-fire.
   In its statement published by Beirut newspapers, Hezbollah, or
Party of God, accused France, Washington and the pope of favoring
Lebanese Christians in the 14-year-old civil war with Moslems.
   ``The French naval buildup in the Mediterranean, the Pope's
fanatic and biased stands, and America's moves at the (U.N.)
Security Council are part of the arrogant campaign aimed at taming
the Moslems,'' it said.
   ``This campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the
crusaders' invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of
martyrdom that forced the (U.S.) Marines and the French to retreat
in 1983,'' it said.
   That was a reference to the twin suicide truck bomb attacks on
Oct. 23, 1983, against the U.S. Marine base and the headquarters of
French paratroopers in Beirut. The bombings killed 241 American
servicemen and 58 French soldiers and led to withdrawal of an
international peace force.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for underground
extremists holding 16 foreign hostages, including eight Americans,
in Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In a separate interview with the Central News Agency newsletter,
an unidentified Hezbollah official was quoted as saying Israel
should immediately release an influential Moslem Shiite cleric
abducted by Israeli commandos last month. The kidnapping prompted
one group to announce it had killed an American hostage, Marine Lt.
Col. William Higgins, in retaliation.
   France dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch, the destroyer
Cassard, and the destroyer Duquesne to the Mediterranean in recent
days while its envoy, Alain Decaux, discussed the crisis with
Lebanese officials.
   Aoun, who serves as army commander and leader of a Christian
Cabinet, was quoted Saturday as saying he would like to see French
forces get involved.
   ``I would like a French military intervention, but I don't want
to compromise France with a Lebanese request. Up until now, we have
exhausted much of our human and material resources, and we need help
to continue the resistance,'' Aoun was quoted in an interview in the
Paris weekly Journal du Dimanche.
   Aoun's 20,000 troops are outnumbered by Syrian's 40,000 soldiers
and its allies. The Syrian soldiers came under terms of a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   French officials say the movement of their forces in the
Mediterranean was designed to help evacuate the estimated 7,000
French citizens if necessary. They say Paris has no intention of
intervening militarily.
   One source close to the Jumblatt's group said his militia's
military police toured a Druse enclave in the Chouf mountains in
recent days ``instructing all physically fit men aged 16-40 to
report to party offices.'' The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Jumblatt also has been critical of the French naval buildup. He
said at a news conference Saturday: ``France still supports the
Maronites.''
   He was referring to Paris' strong links to the Christians before
Lebanon's independence in 1943.
   ``If they insist (on intervening), then let the whole of Lebanon
and the whole of the Middle Eest go up in flames,'' he said.
   The pope has expressed outrage at the recent fighting in Lebanon
and last week said he felt an ``imperative'' to visit the country.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Drops Hard-line Rivals From New Cabinet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani defied half
the lawmakers in parliament on Saturday by nominating a Cabinet that
would remove his hard-line rivals from power and replace them with
allies.
   The attempt to oust rivals who probably would oppose his
political and economic policies raised criticism in parliament,
which must approve all 22 ministers in the new Cabinet individually.
   Rafsanjani is viewed as a pragmatist, seeking more private
investment and links with the West to obtain the technology and
financing to rebuild the economy shattered by eight years of war
with Iraq.
   Three major hard-liners not included in the new Cabinet are Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi, the interior minister; Hussein Musavi, the prime
minister; and Mohammad Rey-Shahri, the minister of intelligence.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, Oil Minister Gholemreza
Aqazadeh and Minister of Islamic Guidance Mohammad Khatami will all
keep their posts, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said in
a reported monitored in Nicosia.
   Mohtashemi is a middle-ranking cleric who was appointed interior
minister in October 1985 after serving as ambassador to Syria from
1981. He is considered the head of the hard-line faction in Iran.
   Earlier Saturday, the Tehran Times, a government-supervised
newspaper close to Rafsanjani, said Mohtashemi would be ousted,
prompting 138 deputies in the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, to
sign a petition demanding he be kept on.
   In the petition, the deputies acknowledged the men were rivals,
but said: ``The presence of powerful personalities in the future
Cabinet is inevitable.''
   The deputies urged Rafsanjani to appoint Mohtashemi, noting the
``sensitivity of the arrogant world'' _ the United States _ to the
issue.
   The petition was read in parliament Saturday and carried by
Iranian news agency.
   Rafsanjani warned during his inauguration speech Thursday that a
fight was brewing over his appointments, but said he wanted to
eliminate political infighting to concentrate on overhauling the
economy and feeding Iran's poor.
   The new president was elected in a landslide July 28.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, the main Iranian opposition group, said in
a telex to The Associated Press that Saturday's parliamentary
session was chaotic.
   The Baghdad-based group said Rafsanjani rushed the nominations to
parliament when he heard the petition was being written.
   Rafsanjani, a middle-ranking cleric, emerged as Iran's strongman
after the June 3 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, architect of
the 1979 Islamic revolution. Rafsanjani's ideological rivals support
a centralized economy and believe confronting the West feeds the
revolution's Islamic fervor.
   Mohtashemi and his allies have spearheaded efforts to export the
revolution through extremist groups such as Hezbollah, or Party of
God, in Lebanon.
   The strength of Rafsanjani's government, especially its ability
to rebuff the hard-line faction, ultimately will decide the shape
and speed of new economic and foreign policy initiatives. The fight
will determine whether Iran will sign a peace treaty with Iraq and
pressure pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon to release 16 Western
hostages, including eight Americans.
   The key position in the battle, the interior minister, controls
Iran's police forces; its revolutionary committees, which enforce
Islamic laws; and Iran's 24 provincial governors, many of them his
appointees.
   Rafsanjani would replace Mohtashemi with Abdullah Nouri, a
leading figure in Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the most fervent
branch of the military.
   Nouri is a Majlis deputy for the central city of Isfahan and
chairman of the Planning and Budget Committee. He was Khomeini's
representative with the Revolutionary Guards, with powers to appoint
and dismiss its commanders.
   Also a middle-ranking cleric, he was named by Khomeini in April
1989 to the committee that amended the 1979 constitution.
   Rey-Shahri, the intelligence minister, will be succeeded by his
deputy, middle-ranking cleric Ali Fallahian, the Iranian news agency
said.
   Fallahian has been a key official in the security apparatus,
particularly in the campaign against the Mujahedeen Khalq.
   Both nominees are considered Rafsanjani allies.
   Constitutional changes approved by the voters July 28 eliminated
the post of prime minister, concentrating executive power in the
presidency.

   Israeli forces shot and killed two Palestinians
on Saturday, and the United States asked Israel to investigate the
shooting death of a Palestinian-American boy whose body was found in
the West Bank.
   Also Saturday, a committee representing lawyers who appear in
military courts said it will end on Monday a month-long strike even
though it did not achieve its goal: better treatment of Palestinian
defendants.
   The army confirmed two Palestinians were killed by soldiers
Saturday, but it denied it was involved in the death of the
Palestinian-American.
   The deaths raised to 537 the number of Palestinians who have been
killed in their uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip since it began in December 1987. Thirty-eight
Israelis have also died.
   Arab reports said an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed
Saturday by Israeli security agents in a market in Bethlehem. They
said Palestinians began stoning a patrol when men dressed in plain
clothes with cameras around their necks pulled out guns and opened
fire.
   Radi Mahmoud Salah was fatally wounded in the chest and four
Arabs were shot and wounded, Arab reports said.
   The market, located near the Church of the Nativity, is
frequented by tourists. The church marked the spot where Jesus is
believed to be born.
   An army spokesman said a patrol opened fire after it was attacked
with stones and bottles and confirmed one Palestinian was killed and
four wounded.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Shaaban Ahmad Seksek, 50, was fatally
wounded by army gunfire in the town of Rafah during a clash between
stone-throwing protesters and soldiers, the army spokesman said.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Consulate said the United States has
asked Israel to investigate the death of Amjad Husain Jibreen, a
15-year-old Palestinian- American who was born in Colorado.
   The spokesman, Gil Sherman, said Jibreen's family reported him
missing Thursday after he failed to return from prayer services in
el-Bireh, a town in the West Bank. Sherman said consular officials
visited the family and asked the military for information on his
death but had received no conclusive answers.
   Jibreen's cousin, Ayman, said the teen-ager was involved in a
demonstration against Israeli troops after prayer services and fled
to the hills surrounding el-Bireh to avoid arrest.
   He said Amjad's body was discovered Saturday moring by a shepherd
in the hills near el-Bireh and was quickly buried before funeral
arrangements could be made. The army routinely takes the bodies of
Palestinians shot in protests to examine the circumstances of death.
   Jibreen said he saw the body after it was discovered and that it
appeared that his cousin was shot at close range. ``There were burns
on his body, some of his teeth were knocked out, and there was a
bullet in his chest,'' he said.
   He said the family contacted the army Thursday, a day after
Jibreen failed to return home, and were told the military ``had no
information on him.''
   ``But Friday afternoon they said he had been arrested,'' Jibreen
said. ``Now they are telling us they have never heard of him.''
Jibreen said he believes his cousin was shot by the army shortly
after his arrest.
   Amjad Jibreen moved to his mother's home town of el-Bireh in
1983. His father, Wathak, lives in Miami.
   The 220-member Arab Lawyers Committee said Saturday that it will
end its strike despite having achieved few gains. The committee is
composed of Palestinian lawyers, but it has four Israeli members.
   ``I think we have achieved nothing,'' said committee member Ahmad
Sayad.
   Commitee leader Bahij Tamami said, ``Our purpose was to protest
and tell the word that there is no justice in Israeli courts.''
   He said the committee had demanded the army promptly report
arrests or detentions to families, translate charge sheets from
Hebrew to Arabic and provide better treatment of prisoners. The
lawyers committee also held a two-month strike beginning in January,
and said it produced few results.
   During the strikes Palestinians either represented themselves or
sought the counsel of the few lawyers who are not members of the
committee.
   Many major cases were delayed until the end of the strike.
   The army says 9,136 Palestinians are currently in Israeli jails
for uprising-related offenses.

   President Bush said Saturday the
United States is prepared to coordinate ``as expeditiously as
possible'' the extradition of suspected Colombian drug dealers after
the assassination Friday of a leading Colombian presidential
candidate near Bogota.
   ``We in the United States should not forget that others are
paying very high costs for the unchecked rampage of the
international criminals trafficking in cocaine and undermining the
lives of law-abiding citizens,'' Bush said in a statement issued
from Kennebunkport where he is vacationing.
   Colombia's President Virgilio Barco said Friday night he was
reinstating under state-of-emergency powers an extradition treaty
between the United States and his country that was voided on a
technicality in April 1988 by the Colombian Supreme Court.
   Barco announced the measure after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a
leading candidate to succeed Barco as Colombia's president, was shot
just before he was scheduled to give a campaign speech in Soacha,
about 20 miles south of Bogota.
   At least 10 others were wounded in the shotgun attack, which
police blamed on drug lords. Hours earlier, a provincial police
chief who had led a campaign against drug lords was shot by five
gunmen less than 200 yards from his home.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement saying the
United States is appalled by what it called the ``latest round of
vicious attacks by the Colombian drug cartels against innocent
Colombians.''
   ``These brazen attacks against Colombian judges, law enforcement
officials and politicians dramatically demonstrate that unwavering
international cooperation is essential if we are to win the war
against the narcotics Mafias,'' the statement said.
   Bush called Barco's reinstatement of the extradition treaty a
``courageous move'' and said he welcomed it in the fight against
``narcotraffickers.''
   ``The U.S. is ready to coordinate the extradition of these
criminals as expeditiously as possible,'' Bush said. ``I have
instructed the departments of State and Justice to begin working on
this immediately.''
   Bush also said he is ``considering alternative ways to do more
for the Andean countries'' in the national drug strategy he is
scheduled to announce on Sept. 5.
   ``I am ready to meet with President Barco at the earliest
convenient moment to consider a coordinated approach to this
problem,'' he said. ``Colombia must know that we stand by its
efforts to move aggressively against these criminals who seek to
destroy both our societies.''
   Bush did not specify the alternatives under consideration for
helping Colombia. But his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft
said they include providing ``some help to shore up their efforts
against, really, what are private armies inside their country.''
   ``As you can see, the whole of the Colombian government is under
attack now by the drug cartels,'' Scowcroft said in an interview on
CNN's Evans and Novak program.

   Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in
Azerbaijan on Saturday to demand that Communist authorities free
jailed members of an independent group and accept its political
demands.
   Nazim Ragimov, a journalist and interpreter, said 600,000
protesters jammed Lenin Square in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan
province. Aidin Amirbekov, a member of the group, the Azerbijani
People's Front, said 200,000 attended.
   There were no immediate reports on the rally in state-run media.
   Ragimov, speaking by telephone from Baku, a city of 1.7 million
on the Caspian Sea, said People's Front officials reported to the
crowd on talks they held with Azerbaijan's Communist Party chief,
Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov.
   Ragimov quoted the group's leaders as saying Vezirov only
accepted one of the People's Front demands during talks that ended
Friday.
   The journalist said the party chief agreed to back efforts to
disband a special committee created by Moscow in February to
administer Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region of Azerbaijan.
   The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh has inflamed relations between
Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has controlled the district since 1923.
   The People's Front claims that far from being neutral,
Moscow-based authorities are pro-Armenian and that the committee
they created has led to a loss of Azerbaijani sovereignty.
   People's Front leaders said Vezirov rejected their other demands,
including annulment of the results of this spring's legislative
elections and the freeing of People's Front militants such as Naimat
Panakhov and Fuat Agayev who were detained during mass political
rallies in Baku late last year.
   Ragimov said People's Front members and supporters will meet
again Sept. 2 and declare a general strike if their demands have not
been granted.
   A protest strike called Monday by the grassroots group over the
same issues led to the walkout of about 1 percent of Baku's 1
million workers, according to journalists at Azerbaijan's state-run
Azerinform news agency.

<HEAD>Gandhi Sees Bigger World Role for India</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said Saturday
that India must play a bigger role in world affairs with the
superpowers shifting from Cold War politics to more dialogue.
   In an interview with The Associated Press and United News of
India, Gandhi also said he feared a hasty withdrawal of Indian
peacekeeping troops from Sri Lanka could lead to partition of the
island between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority.
   He said he expected his own national elections, due no later than
January, to be held ``more or less on schedule.'' While he declined
to be more specific, he indicated early elections were unlikely.
   ``I feel India must play a bigger role and will play a bigger
role, and the global equations are changing. People are coming out
of their old mindsets,'' the Indian leader said during the interview.
   ``That's where countries like India can play a much bigger role,
like we have done in the non-aligned (movement), like we have done
in disarmament _ really bringing the opposition poles together,
getting nations to think more in terms of one world, not our bloc
and their bloc.''
   Gandhi has maintained his country's strong ties with the Soviet
Union that date back to the days of his grandfather, Jawaharlal
Nehru, India's first prime minister, and his mother and predecessor,
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. But he also has broadened ties with
the United States, especially in trade and technology.
   India is the world's second-most populous nation with 880 million
people. China has 1.2 billion people.
   During the interview, Gandhi said the withdrawal of the 40,000
Indian soldiers from Sri Lanka still was under discussion with the
Colombo government, which has demanded a speedy pullout.
   ``What's worrying us is that if we come (back) without something
else taking our place and things get out of control, it will lead to
the division of Sri Lanka,'' he said.
   He said India has asked Sri Lanka, whose armed forces barely
total 40,000, how it proposes to deal with security after an Indian
withdrawal. ``Just moving out and leaving a vacuum is not really a
solution,'' he said.
   India, spurred by the sympathies of its own Tamil minority for
Tamil secessionists in Sri Lanka, sponsored a 1987 peace accord to
end a separatist revolt in the north and east of the small Indian
Ocean island.
   The largest Tamil rebel group rejected the plan, and Indian
soldiers sent to enforce it were soon bogged down in a guerrilla war
against the same Tamil militants India once supported.
   Gandhi, who turns 45 on Sunday, looked relaxed and confident
during the interview as he sat in the private cabin of the Indian
air force Boeing 737 that carried him and his entourage on a two-day
tour of south India.
   The trip, which was a campaign tour in everything but name, was
taking him across Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh states to make 13
speeches in 28 hours.
   During the interview, he repeatedly blasted the political
opposition, especially the fractious alliance called the Janata Dal,
or National Front. Its president, Viswanath Pratap Singh, was once
Gandhi's finance minister and later his defense minister.
   In jam-packed sports stadiums, Gandhi told crowds that the
opposition sought to divide the country along lines of religion and
caste and oppress women and poor people.
   In the interview, Gandhi predicted his party would do ``very
well'' in the upcoming national elections. But he would not estimate
how many seats it would win.
   His victory in December 1984 gave his party an unprecendented 415
of the 544 seats in the policy-setting lower house of Parliament.
   A poll published in the Aug. 31 issue of India Today, a respected
national news magazine, projected Congress would win 314 seats in
the next elections.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Esther Rolle has made a name for
herself on stage and on television's ``Maude'' and ``Good Times,''
but she says the lot of the black actor has improved little since
she started in show business in 1942.
   ``No matter what age I am or what age they require, I generally
have to be fat and gray,'' said Miss Rolle, 55, who played the maid
Florida on ``Maude.'' ``They can't see an attractive, mature black
grandmother. She has to be gray and decrepit, generally. But a white
grandmother can be her age.''
   Miss Rolle, in Winston-Salem recently for the National Black
Theatre Festival, said the best hope for black actors is the small
but growing number of black producers. Whites, she said, just don't
think of casting blacks in mainstream roles.
   ``How long have you watched ``Magnum, P.I.,''' she asked.
``Magnum's got women chasing him every day.'' But Roger Mosley, the
black actor who played Magnum's sidekick, she said, ``is at least as
attractive, but you seldom see him with a woman.''

   A woman who was hit in the arm by a stray
bullet while dining in a 31st-floor apartment says she's uneasy the
police haven't got a clue to where the shot came from.
   ``I understand the police are terribly busy, and there's a lot of
crime going on,'' Gail Downward said last week. ``But someone out
there has a gun ... that they are shooting randomly.''
   Ms. Downward was eating in a friend's top-floor apartment on chic
Rittenhouse Square on Aug. 3 when she was hit.
   ``I had just taken a bite of grilled tuna when I heard a crack,''
she said. ``I had the fork in my hand, and when I tried to put it
back on the plate, I realized my arm was not working properly.
   ``I looked down and saw a hole in my forearm about the size of a
dime,'' she said. ``There was no blood, just a hole. I felt like I
was part of a Salvador Dali painting.''
   Police said the bullet went through a screen, a window, and a
Venetian blind before it struck Ms. Downward in the right forearm.
It was traveling on a level trajectory, which perplexes
investigators because there aren't any buildings nearby where a
gunman could have fired a level shot into the window.
   ``We have no idea where this bullet came from,'' said Capt.
Richard Kirchner. ``If you look out, the only thing in that area
that's really tall is the Arco burn-off tower'' two miles away.
   There weren't any shooting reports that coincided with the
incident, Kirchner said.
   Ms. Downward said police initially thought the bullet came from a
high-powered rifle, but later said it may have from another kind of
gun. Doctors haven't removed the slug for fear of causing more
damage to her arm.
   ``If the doctors ever decide to remove the bullet, we can run
ballistics on it,'' Kirchner said. ``Then, one day, a gun could turn
up and we could match it.''

   Hundreds of East Germans escaped into
Austria from Hungary on Saturday by storming a border gate that had
been opened for a picnic celebrating European unity, officials said.
   The East Germans pushed through the gate as it was being opened
and as Hungarian border guards were preparing to stamp the papers of
participants in the event, the Austrian Press Agency.
   Police said only that hundreds of East Germans who were not
supposed to participate in the event pushed through the gate that is
normally closed.
   The Press Agency said up to 300 East Germans pushed through
initially, and a total of 500 crossed into Austria during the day
while the gate remained open.
   In Budapest, the Hungarian Interior Ministry said the border
guards could only have stopped the East Germans from crossing by
using weapons, said the state news agency MTI. However, ``they
decided not to use weapons or force,'' MTI said in a brief dispatch.
   The event called for participants to cross the border into
Austria, return with Austrian guests, and then picnic in a formerly
restricted Hungarian zone. The restrictions were lifted Aug. 1.
   The event was sponsored by Hungary's foremost Communist reformer,
Imre Pozsgay, and Otto von Hapsburg, a West German member of the
European Parliament and one-time heir to the former Austro-Hungarian
monarchy. He is a leader of the Austrian branch of the Pan-Europa
movement, a private group promoting European unity.
   Hungary, one of the most liberal countries in the East bloc, in
May began dismantling the barbed wire fencing and electrical warning
devices on its border with Austria.
   At least 1,600 East Germans are estimated to have crossed
illegally into Austria from Hungary since then. Once in Austria,
they seek documents from the West German Embassy in Vienna for
travel to West Germany.
   According to West German law, all East Germans have a right to
West German passports.
   Some refugees say they are seeking political freedom, and others
are fleeing poor economic conditions in their Communist homeland.
   West German diplomats have been issuing West German passports to
East Germans in Budapest, Hungary, and witnesses said many of the
East Germans who fled Saturday already held West German passports.
   About 300 East Germans have sought refuge at West German
diplomatic missions in East Berlin; Budapest; and Prague,
Czechoslovakia.
   West Germany closed its embassy and consulate in Budapest on
Monday, citing the inability of its diplomats to deal with the
stream of East Germans wanting to flee to the West and seeking
asylum on West German diplomatic property.
   The West German mission in East Berlin was closed two weeks ago
after 131 East Germans seeking guarantees that they can go to West
Germany sought refuge there.
   Another 500 East Germans are living in a tent city set up in
Budapest, and opposition figures estimate that several hundred more
have overstayed their visas and gone underground.

   Heavy rain unleashed
mudslides that buried a car, temporarily trapped eight others and
caused flooding that chased 55 tourists from their rented cabin,
park officials said Saturday.
   The mudslides took place about 8 p.m. Friday on a stretch of road
below slopes denuded by the huge forest fires that swept the park in
the summer of 1988.
   One car was buried, but its occupants escaped uninjured, said
park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   Eight vehicles were stranded for about 2{ hours in Gibbon Canyon
after 13 mudslides took place, the spokeswoman said. They were on a
stretch of road 15 to 25 miles inside the park from the west
entrance that was hit by mudslides earlier this month.
   Thunderstorms that dumped up to 4 inches of rain on the park sent
water 3 feet deep through a cluster of cabins in the Mammoth area
near the north entrance, forcing evacuation of 55 guests, Ms.
Anzelmo said.
   No one was injured in either incident.
   Workers expected to have the road cleared by Sunday, but
considered keeping it closed to traffic as a precaution, the
spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
   Representatives from Sudan's new
military government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army on
Saturday night began talks aimed at ending their 6-year-old civil
war.
   The talks are the first between the rebels and the government of
Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, who seized power in a June 30 coup.
   Representatives of both sides spoke with reporters before
beginning the closed-door talks.
   Col. Mohamed Amin Khalifa, leader of the Sudanese government
delegation, said his team came to talks aiming to ``to arrive at a
final and mutually acceptable settlement through sincere and
constructive dialogue.''
   Lam Akol, who headed the rebel delegation, said the guerrillas
had ``come here to hear with an open mind the proposals by the
government to solve the problem in Sudan.''
   Akol is a member of the rebel high command.
   The talks come five days after a speech by rebel leader John
Garang in which he threatened to use a popular uprising to overthrow
the new military government unless it stepped down and opened the
way for a direct election.
   Garang also demanded the release of political prisoners and the
lifting of a ban on political parties that el-Bashir imposed after
the coup.
   Following the speech, Khalifa was quoted as saying Garang's
statement would not affect the peace talks and underlining the
government's resolve not to ``pursue a course of action and
reaction.''
   After seizing power, El-Bashir said one of his first priorities
would be to find a peaceful solution to the civil war.
   But he scrapped a tentative peace accord signed in November by
the rebels.
   Sudan's northern government is Arab-leaning and Moslem
donminated; the rebels come from the predominantly Christian and
ethnically African south. The guerrillas took up arms in 1983
seeking greater autonomy and economic and administrative reforms for
the south.
   Hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese have died during the
war, primarily of famine.

   Helicopter pilot Tim Graves says he feared
prison guards would kill him when two inmates' wives commandeered
his chopper and forced him to land at the Arkansas Valley
Correctional Facility.
   ``Imagine what it feels like to be flying, and all at once you
have two pistols on your head, and they tell you that you're going
to land at a prison ... your biggest fear is being shot by the
prison guards,'' Graves told reporters Friday.
   ``You don't know if they're going to let you get out of there
alive. You figure once you land they're going to kill you,'' Graves
said.
   Authorities said Patricia Gonzales, 41, and Rebecca Brown, 26,
ordered Graves to pluck their husbands from the prison yard. The
four later transferred to a van and drove as far as Holdrege, Neb.,
about 400 miles away, where they were captured after a shootout with
authorities.
   Bob Pence, head of the Denver FBI office, said Graves is not a
suspect in the escape attempt. Graves said he filled in on the
flight for another pilot who canceled the night before.
   The FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration interviewed
Graves for three hours for any information he might have about who
was involved in the escape and where the foursome was headed, Pence
said.
   Pence said the women could be charged with air piracy, a federal
crime.
   The women had reserved a 1969 Bell 206-A helicopter from
Helicopter Airways Inc. at Centennial Airport in suburban Denver,
telling company officials they wanted to take photographs of real
estate. The women were picket up at La Junta.
   ``They pulled out the guns after we were in the air for 10
minutes, and they said, `You're going to land in that prison,'''
Graves said.
   After plucking Ralph Brown, 30, and cellmate Freddie Gonzales,
21, from the prison yard, Graves flew the helicopter out and landed
about 30 miles north of Ordway, near an abandoned farmhouse along
Colorado Highway 71.
   The escapees tied Graves up and put him face down in a shed, with
a handkerchief protecting his face from the dirt, Lincoln County
Sheriff LeRoy Yowell said.
   It took Graves about half an hour to cut himself free with a
pocket knife, Yowell said. Searchers in another helicopter spotted
him waving the handkerchief at them.
   Graves had been flying for Helicopter Airways for about three
months after a five-year Army stint.
   Vic Meisinger, president of Helicopter Airways, said a woman
identifying herself as Julie Quinn contacted him Aug. 10 about
renting the helicopter to take her and another woman to see real
estate near La Junta. Meisinger said he scheduled to pick up the
women on Wednesday, but he scrapped the flight because of bad
weather and rescheduled it for Friday morning.
   Graves said he was awakened at 6 a.m. to fill in for another
pilot who canceled the night before.

   Prisoners at the Arkansas Valley
Correctional Facility cheered when a helicopter swooped over the
prison's baseball diamond and plucked up two inmates.
   Since then, the medium-security prison has been buzzing with talk
of the short-lived escape and surprise at the unlikely pair of
inmates that tried it.
   ``They're talking about it _ `Just like the movies,' `It was
cool,''' said inmate Phillip D. Gonzales, serving a life sentence
for the murder of a Denver police officer.
   ``Most of these guys are happy to see (prison officials) get
beat. They're happy to see someone leave, escape, whatever. It added
a little drama.''
   Cellmates Ralph Brown and Freddie Gonzales, no relation to
Phillip, sprinted and dove into the chopper when it came down into
the prison yard Friday morning. There were few inmates in the yard
at the time.
   The men and their wives, who authorities say had hijacked the
helicopter, later transferred to a van and drove as far as Nebraska,
where they were captured Friday evening in a shootout with police.
One fugitive was slightly wounded.
   Gonzales; his wife, Patricia Gonzales, 41; Brown; and his wife,
Rebecca, 26; were being held Saturday in Nebraska. Ms. Gonzales was
described as a onetime prison volunteer who met Gonzales during the
course of her service and married him by proxy.
   Prison Superintendent Jim Brittain, who watched the escape from
the bulletproof-glass window of his office, said he was surprised
Brown and Gonzales would have attempted it.
   ``When I looked at their time and their crime, I have a difficult
time understanding what's going on,'' said Brittain. He said he
``would expect that from a much more desperado-type of inmate. The
one guy (Brown) was serving 12 years and the other guy (Gonzales)
four years.''
   The escapees were described as an unlikely duo _ a 21-year-old
with only one major crime on his record and a 30-year-old with a
dozen years of serious offenses.
   Gonzales had minor brushes with the law in Fort Morgan until an
armed robbery last year sent him to Ordway. He would have been
eligible for parole in two years.
   In the robbery at a 7-Eleven store, he panicked before he got the
money and took only a sandwich, authorities said. While awaiting
sentencing in Morgan County Jail, he tried unsuccessfully to escape.
   Brown had been in and out of prison for a dozen years on
convictions including sexual assault, theft and forgery. He also
admitted to heavy cocaine use before being sent back to prison for a
third time last year. He would not have been eligible for parole
until 1996.
   Despite the festive mood at the prison Friday, some inmates
worried they will suffer from tighter security measures in the wake
of the escape.
   ``It was fun to hear and know it did happen, (but) it is just
going to make things tougher in the institution,'' said Phillip
Aversano, serving 10 years for theft and walking away from a halfway
house.
   ``That's the way is usually works. Somebody screws up. It makes
it tougher for everyone.''

   Two Colorado prison inmates and their
wives, captured in a shootout after the women hijacked a helicopter
for a daring breakout, will likely face charges in two states and
federal courts, officials said Saturday.
   Investigators into Friday's escape from the medium-security
Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility near Ordway, Colo., said one
of the women involved met her husband while working as a prison
volunteer and married him by proxy.
   The escapees, Freddie Gonzales, 21, and Ralph Brown, 30, and
their wives, Patricia Gonzales, 41, and Rebecca Brown, 26,
surrendered Friday evening after a nine-minute gun battle in this
small south-central Nebraska town 400 miles from the prison.
   ``This will be the talk of the town for a few days, but then
things'll get back to normal,'' said Ford Hubbard, night manager of
the Dale Hotel.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Hubbard, who watched the gunfight
and capture from the roof of his six-story hotel. ``It was like
watching a TV movie. I know that other people were watching from
their windows, too. We haven't had anything like this in town for
years.''
   Colorado Department of Corrections chief Walter Kautzky said the
foursome likely will face federal charges of air piracy, Nebraska
charges, and then extradition proceedings for likely charges in
Colorado.
   Three of the four were being held in separate jails Saturday.
Brown underwent surgery for a bullet wound to the finger and was
being held at Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney.
   Authorities in Colorado say the women comandeered the helicopter
after hiring it from Helicopter Airways Inc. of Denver. The FBI says
the helicopter pilot, Tim Graves, is not a suspect in the escape.
   After the escape, the four abandoned the 1969 Bell 206-A
helicopter and transferred to the rented van. Graves, who was tied
up and left in a shed, managed to cut himself free with a pocket
knife and was found by searchers.
   ``They pulled out the guns after we were in the air for 10
minutes, and they said, `You're going to land in that prison,'''
Graves said later.
   Graves said his biggest fear was that he would be shot by prison
guards; prison officials said Friday that the guards held their fire
during the escape in part because of fear for the pilot's safety.
   Kautzky said Ms. Gonzales worked as a volunteer at the Arkansas
Valley prison in Ordway and at the Fremont Correctional Facility in
Canon City, where she met her husband, Freddie, before he was moved
to Ordway. She was also working on a degree from Regis College in
Denver, he said.
   ``Under Colorado law, you can get married by proxy and that's
apparently what they did,'' he said.
   He did not know when there were married, or what her duties as a
volunteer were. The Regis College switchboard operator says no one
is available this weekend to provide information about students or
confirm Gonzales was enrolled.
   Gonzales' father, Fred, said his son married Patricia three
months ago.
   The elder Gonzales, of Fort Morgan, said Ms. Gonzales visited his
son every Friday and Saturday at the Arkansas Valley prison.
   ``I hope they did catch him because I don't want him to get in
any trouble. God, he's the only son I've got,'' the father said as
he watched news of his son's capture on television Friday night.
   Holdrege police officers and Phelps County sheriff's deputies
fired on the van during the chase that covered roughly an
eight-square block area of this town of 5,600.
   The four were set to be arraigned Monday, although Phelps County
Attorney Glenn Clark said Saturday he is still pondering charges.
They federal and Colorado charges, he said, would come ``only after
were through with them'' in Nebraska.
   He added that he was strongly considering filing attempted murder
charges for the shooting at police Sgt. Tom Rust, who had bullets
lodged in the air cleaner and the dashboard of his car.
   ``That one in the dashboard was only inches from going all the
way through, and it would have gone all the way through Rust,''
Clark said.
   Rust used his police car to ram the van twice. That action is
credited with slowing the vehicle moments before Police Chief Ken
Jackson, positioned near his pickup truck, placed four shots through
the windshield of the suspects' van.
   ``I think they were surprised to see me there,'' said Jackson, a
veteran of the Lancaster County Sheriff's Department in Lincoln.
   Jackson's nine-member force recently received approval for the
purchase of two semi-automatic weapons. ``We definitely could have
ended this a lot sooner with one of those,'' Jackson said.
   ``But people criticized my background in Lincoln, a city of
200,000, and said we'd never need them in Holdrege,'' Jackson said.
``You know the old saying ... never say never,'' he added with a
grin.
   Gonzales was serving a four-year sentence for robbery and would
have been eligible for parole in September 1991. Brown was sentenced
for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check
charge; his parole eligibility date was October 1996.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Drench Delaware and Many Areas Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled across much of the nation on Saturday,
dumping flood-level rains in Delaware and whipping up winds and
small hail in Wyoming.
   Thunderstorms were scattered over the East Coast, the Gulf Coast,
the Mississippi Valley and the central Rockies.
   Early morning rains left around 8 inches of rain, flooding
sections of Delaware's southeast corner. Most of the flooding
occurred in the area between Frankford, Selbyville and Roxanna in
Sussex County. Seven small bridges were washed out and a number of
roads were rendered impassable.
   Showers extended across south central New York, eastern
Pennsylvania and central New Jersey.
   In Wyoming, a thunderstorm generated winds gusting to 59 mph.
Thunderstorms produced small hail in the Big Horn Mountains in the
north central part of the state.
   Scattered thunderstorms also fell over eastern sections of the
Carolinas, southeast Georgia, parts of Florida and along much of the
Gulf Coast from northwest Florida to southeast Texas. Streets were
flooded in Wilmington, N.C.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across eastern Minnesota and
eastern Iowa and from central Missouri to northeast Oklahoma.
   Skies were clear across much of California and the desert
Southwest and from most of Texas to southwest Kansas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 100 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif. The morning low in the lower 48 states was 36
degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Sunday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Mississippi Valley;
numerous showers and storms over southeastern New England, and
across Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and east central Illinois; and widely
scattered storms and showers over the Rockies and the southern
Plains.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s from northern New
England to the Great Lakes region, the upper Mississippi Valley and
North Dakota; in the 60s near Lake Superior; in the 70s in the
Rockies and along the Pacific Coast; in the 90s in portions of the
south Atlantic Coast states, Florida and the Gulf Coast and in
Oklahoma and Arkansas; in the 90s to near 100 degrees in Texas and
the inland valleys of California; between 100 and 105 degrees in the
desert Southwest; and in the 80s elsewhere across the nation.

   Drug lords declared they would keep
killing government officials following the assassination of leading
presidential hopeful Luis Carlos Galan. Tens of thousands of
mourners on Saturday flocked to Galan's coffin.
   ``Now the fight is with blood,'' said the Medellin Cartel in a
brief communique broadcast by the RCN radio network and printed by
the Bogota daily La Prensa.
   The cartel, the world's largest cocaine ring, is believed
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United
States.
   ``We do want peace. We have screamed for it, but we will not beg
for it,'' the statement said. It was signed ``The Extraditables,'' a
reference to the traffickers likely to be extradited to the United
States.
   The statement did not specifically claim responsibility for
Galan's death but said the group would keep killing officials.
Police blamed the drug lords, who had offered a $500,000 reward for
his death and had tried to kill him Aug. 5 in Medillin.
   Galan was shot and killed Friday in Soache, 12 miles from Bogota,
as he prepared to address 10,000 people at a campaign rally.
   In the attack by at least seven gunmen, local councilman Julio
Cesar Penalosa was killed and at least six others wounded. The
gunmen escaped. Police said Saturday they had detained three
suspects but did not name them.
   Hours earlier, drug lords shot and killed a provincial police
chief, Franklin Quintero.
   Responding to the killings, President Virgilio Barco on Friday
announced a harsh crackdown. He said in a nationwide television and
radio address he would use his powers under the nation's state of
siege to re-establish a treaty with the United States to extradite
suspected traffickers.
   The state of emergency was declared in 1984 because of drug
trafficking and guerrilla activity.
   The Supreme Court threw out the extradition treaty in April 1988
on a technicality.
   President Bush said Saturday the United States is prepared to
coordinate ``as expeditiously as possible'' the extradition of
suspected Colombian drug dealers.
   ``We in the United States should not forget that others are
paying very high costs for the unchecked rampage of the
international criminals trafficking in cocaine and undermining the
lives of law-abiding citizens,'' Bush said in a statement issued
from Kennebunkport, Maine, where he is vacationing.
   Barco consistently has refused to negotiate with the drug lords,
who have never made their demands known.
   In his speech, he cautioned Colombians they should be prepared
``to experience more pain and sufferings'' in what he called the
``war against the nation'' unleashed by drug rings.
   The government sent an elite police command to the drug-bastion
city of Medellin, and the army was placed under alert. This means
the army can be called any time into action anywhere in the country.
   Galan, 46, presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, was
leading by wide margins in opinion polls for planned presidential
elections in May 1990.
   A journalist who later became a politician, Galan favored
extraditing drug traffickers, saying it was instrumental to their
defeat.
   Aware of threats against him, Galan wore a bullet-proof vest
while attending public meetings.The vest shielded him from three
bullets but a fourth killed him, according to a forensic report.
   As news of Galan's death spread through the country, crowds
estimated at hundreds of thousands came out on the streets shouting
``justice, justice,'' and demanding action against the drug cartels.
   Galan's body was carried to the national capital building in
Bogota accompanied by tens of thousands of mourners, many with tears
in ther eyes. Barco and his top ministers appeared to pay their
respects to the candidate's family.
   ``Galan lives in the hearts of 30 million Colombians,'' some
shouted. ``Death sentence for drug traffickers,'' others said.
   The government has decreed a three-day mourning period for Galan,
who will be buried Sunday.
   Quintero, 46, police commander for Antioquia province where
Medellin is located, recently had given up his official bodyguards
and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges.
   He directed the local campaign against cocaine trafficking and
led raids that resulted in the seizure of tons of the drug and the
arrest of several dealers.
   At his funeral Saturday, Police General Director Gen. Miguel
Gomez Padilla pledged: ``We will wipe out from our soil, now and
forever, the infamous criminals involved in the stigmatizing drug
trafficking activities.''

   A federal appeals court Saturday stayed the
execution of William Andrews just three days before he was to die by
lethal injection for three 1974 torture-killings dubbed the ``hi-fi
murders.''
   A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
issued the stay for Andrews, the nation's longest-standing death
inmate, after failed appeals in federal and state courts and the
state Board of Pardons' rejection of his plea for clemency on Friday.
   Defense attorney Robert Anderson said Andrews had been informed
shortly after the order was issued at about 10 a.m.
   ``He was very grateful and was very relieved. He still considers
this matter very solemnly,'' Anderson said.
   The three-judge panel, which had convened here for a hearing
later Saturday, issued the stay based on Andrews' latest writ of
habeas corpus despite a federal magistrate's Thursday recommendation
that procedural rules barred the U.S. District Court from hearing it.
   The document did not include a reason for the stay, but said a
more detailed order would follow later. The order was signed by
Judge Monroe McKay on behalf of fellow judges Stephen Anderson and
Bobby Baldock.
   Special state prosecutor Robert Wallace, who had gone to the
federal courthouse to get the order, declined to discuss it except
to say, ``I have some thoughts, but I really don't want to make a
comment at this time.''
   Andrews, 34, of Jonesboro, La., has been on death row for nearly
15 years for the slayings of two women and a man during a robbery of
the Hi-Fi Shop in Ogden. Five people were forced to drink liquid
drain cleaner and were then shot; two of them survived.
   His co-defendant, Pierre Dale Selby, admitted he shot the victims
after Andrews left the store. Selby was executed in August 1987.
   In his writ, Andrews had argued that his rights were violated at
trial by inadequate defense counsel, that a judge's failed to
instruct the jury it could find him guilty of a lesser offense, and
that a mistrial should have been declared when a juror found a note
in a restaurant during a lunch break saying, ``Hang the niggers.''
The juror gave it to the judge; its origin was never determined.
   The jury was all white; both defendants were black.
   On Friday, the state pardons board had announced its 2-1 decision
to deny Andrews' request for life imprisonment instead of the death
penalty.
   Board Chairman H.L. Haun said he and panelist Edward Kimball
decided that although Selby shot the victims, Andrews' help in
forcing them to drink liquid Drano and his knowledge they would be
killed made commutation impossible.

<TEXT>
   When the list of Solidarity candidates was
posted for Poland's historic elections for parliament two months ago
the name of one top Solidarity adviser was missing.
   Tadeusz Mazowiecki, among Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's closest
advisers since the independent union was founded in August 1980, had
declined an offer to run.
   Now Mazowiecki, a lawyer and journalist, is poised to become
Poland's first non-Communist prime minister since World War II after
his nomination by Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski on
Saturday.
   During the election campaign his associates wondered why
Mazowiecki had turned down a political career in favor of editing
Tygodnik Solidarnosc, the Solidarity weekly.
   And now the question is why, after his apparent reluctance to
enter the political arena, was Mazowiecki Walesa's choice?
   Walesa proposed two additional names to Jaruzelski on Thursday _
historian Bronislaw Geremek, the Solidarity floor leader in
parliament, and legislator Jacek Kuron, a free union activist for 25
years.
   Walesa described the choice as ``a terrible dilemma.''
   Walesa said Saturday that Kuron ``deserved it for his struggle''
but was not acceptable to Communist leaders because of his years of
aggressive opposition.
   ``Bronislaw is the best among us, it is true. ... He deserved
it,'' Walesa said, but it was critical that Geremek continue to lead
Solidarity's parliamentary delegation.
   ``Thus having a general look at the whole arrangment, I decided
that such a solution is best for Poland,'' Walesa said of
Mazowiecki's selection.
   Mazowiecki understands the two other pillars of power in Poland _
the Roman Catholic church and Communist Party. He founded the
influential Club of Catholic Intelligentsia in 1957 and served in
parliament during the 1960s in a Communist-sanctioned delegation
under the church's protection.
   Jacek Ambroziak, a lawyer who works with Mazowiecki at the
Solidarity newspaper, said the nominee is an experienced negotiator
who listens to a range of views and shuns hasty decisions.
   ``He is very close to Lech Walesa but he will be his own man,''
Ambroziak said.
   Walesa's choice was unexpected by some Solidarity leaders.
   ``I am very surprised because Mazowiecki was against this idea of
a Soidarity-led government at this time,'' said Zbigniew Bujak, head
of the union's Warsaw region.
   In a July 14 editorial in his newspaper, Mazowiecki warned
against a hasty move by the Solidarity to take responsibility for
the government and its economic problems.
   ``What will be good tomorrow may be fatal today,'' he wrote.
   Shortly after the 1980 shipyard strike broke out, which was to
lead to the creation of Solidarity, Mazowiecki and Geremek rushed to
the port city of Gdansk to deliver an appeal signed by more than 60
intellectuals urging authorities to find a non-violent solution. The
two men became advisers to the strikers.
   Mazowiecki was jailed during the December 1981 martial-law
crackdown on Solidarity.
   Released after a year, Mazowiecki became Walesa's assistant. He
participated in negotiations this spring with communist authorities
that led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status.
   Mazowiecki's links to the Catholic church are even longer. After
World War II and the Communist takeover he engaged in the struggle
to preserve the church's independence. He established the
intellectuals club and then founded Link, a Catholic monthly that is
still being published.
   He is a personal friend of Polish-born Pope John Paul II, and
after meeting with Jaruzelski on Friday he was received by Polish
Primate Jozef Glemp, with whom he prayed.
   Although he served in parliament from 1961 to 1970 as part of the
church-linked delegation, his decision not to run for parliament
this year seems to have worked in his favor.
   ``Mazowiecki is out of the parliamentary club so he is not
engaged in parliamentary intitiatives,'' said Bogdan Lis, a
Solidarity senator.
   Mazowiecki's dealings with Communist legislators while he was in
parliament may have made him more acceptable to party officials.
   Mazowiecki is expected to attend a meeting Sunday of the leaders
of the Solidarity union and its parliamentary delegation to plan
forming a government.

<HEAD>Sheriff Suspends Two, Newspaper Report Chronicles Corruption Cover-ups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cook County's sheriff on Saturday pressed for the
firing of two of his officers as a newspaper reported allegations
that the department had suppressed investigations of mob murders and
internal corruption for years.
   The two officers, who are accused of robbing a drug dealer, were
suspended Friday after reporters sought comment from Sheriff James
O'Grady for an article on the alleged corruption published in early
Sunday edition of the Chicago Tribune.
   The report said sheriff's officers have concealed evidence,
thwarted efforts to interview witnesses and hidden their own
relationships with suspects and victims in murder investigations
dating back 15 years.
   Telephone calls from The Associated Press to the sheriff's
department for comment on the Tribune's report went unanswered
Saturday.
   On Friday, Sheriff's Police Lt. William H. Martin, 55, a 22-year
veteran of the department, was suspended for his alleged
participation in the 1986 robbery of a suburban drug dealer.
   Deputy Larry Geanes, 39, a six-year employee of the Court
Services department, also was suspended for alleged involvement in
the scheme.
   O'Grady will press the county State's Attorney's office to file
criminal charges against the men and will go before a merit board to
seek their dismissal, spokesman William Currie said Saturday.
   A telephone call to a residence with the listing of L. Geanes in
south suburban Calumet City went unanswered Saturday. At the Martin
residence, a man who identified himself as William Martin's father
said the officer was not available for comment.
   The sheriff's department, with headquarters in Chicago, runs the
county jail and has a 500-member police force to cover the 177
square miles of unicorporated Cook County and forest preserve land.
   According to the Tribune, no one has been convicted of an
organized crime murder in Cook County in more than two decades. The
sheriff's department has run the investigations of most of the
estimated 70 organized crime murders in the Chicago area in the last
25 years.
   The case in which the two men have been suspended began to
unravel Feb. 2, 1987, after Dwayne Henderson, a street-level drug
dealer and police informant, was shot twice in the head. His body
was dumped in an isolated area.
   For 1{ years, high-ranking sheriff's officials prevented
investigators from aggressively pursuing the case, the paper said,
quoting unidentified sources. The allegations include accusations
that Henderson, along with sheriff's officers and jail guards, set
up a robbery and extortion ring that preyed on suburban drug
dealers, the newspaper said.
   Rather than expose allegations that fellow officers and jail
guards were suspects in the case, high-ranking sheriff's officers
hid evidence and sanitized files, the Tribune said, citing
interviews and department records.
   O'Grady, elected sheriff in 1986, said he first heard of the
cover-up allegations in the middle of 1988. By O'Grady's account,
some high-ranking officers gave investigators the impression they
should ``tread slowly'' in efforts to solve the murder.
   ``I was so concerned about the investigation that I let the FBI
know about it,'' O'Grady said. ``I wasn't happy about the case then,
and I'm still not happy about the case's status.''
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified drug dealer as saying that
four or five men who identified themselves as sheriff's police
swarmed around him one night and took his money and drugs.
   Many of the cover-ups alleged in the article took place during
the administration of Richard Elrod, county sheriff from 1970
through 1986. Elrod, who had little to do with day-to-day
operations, told the newspaper he knew nothing of the corruption
alleged in the article.
   ``I had no inkling,'' said Elrod, now a Cook County Circuit Court
judge.

   WARSAW, Poland _ President Wojciech Jaruzelski on Saturday
nominated Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister,
paving the way for a historic break in the Communist monopoly on
leadership in the East bloc.
   A statement released by the official news agency said the
president decided the new Solidarity-led coalition government was
necessary to help solve Poland's crippling economic problems and end
widespread public discontent.
   ``The president thinks that the formation of such a government
will be conducive to expeditiously overcoming economic difficulties
... and satisfying the needs and aspirations of Polish society,''
the PAP news agency said.
   Mazowiecki must be approved by the Sejm, or lower house of the
National Assembly. The Sejm speaker will receive the nomination
Monday, and the assembly will meet Wednesday. Approval is virtually
assured because Solidarity and its coalition partners, two minor
parties, have a majority in the body.
   The new government will be the first in the Soviet bloc not led
by Communists since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin consolidated
communist control in the late 1940s.
   ``I am terrified,'' Mazowiecki said in an interview on Polish
state television. But ``I think ... we can do a lot, that we can
release the forces in ourselves. I think that it will not be easy,
but it is possible.''
   A jubilant Lech Walesa said: ``It is an incredible success for
our struggle. But now let us see it in practice. ... This is just
the beginning.''
   Speaking in a telephone interview from his Gdansk home, Walesa,
who has led Solidarity since it was founded in 1980, said he now
feels free to leave the world of politics to others and to devote
himself entirely to union affairs.
   Once approved, Mazowiecki will have several weeks to form his
Cabinet, which will include Solidarity, Communists and non-Comunists.
   Mindful of the Soviet Union's strategic concerns, Solidarity has
said it will let the Communist Party retain control of the
ministries of defense and interior, which oversee the army and
police. In addition, local governments and the court system will
remain controlled by party members.
   Solidarity also has promised that the change will not endanger
Poland's participation in the Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   The Soviet Union, while expressing concern last week, has said it
considers the formation of a government an internal Polish affair.
   Mazowiecki's nomination marks a once-inconceivable victory for
the the East bloc's first free trade union, which was banned by
Jaruzelski after the 1981 martial-law crackdown. Mazowiecki himself
was imprisoned for one year.
   Solidarity, whose success in June parliament elections pressured
the government into the unprecedented action, immediately promised
Mazowiecki its ``full support.''
   ``This should produce a major breakthrough in Polish public life
by doing away with the present policy of `nomenklatura,''' the
system in which only party members are appointed to most senior jobs
in government and the economy, the movement said in a statement.
   However, some union leaders expressed apprehension about
Solidarity assuming responsibility for governing so quickly after
its April 17 legalization.
   ``I thought it would be healthier for us to have these things
happening a little bit later, because in the meantime we would gain
a certain experience,'' said union spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
''I think it is very risky.''
   Saturday's government announcement came as the Communist Party
met in Warsaw and Walesa met union members in Gdansk. Mazowiecki was
said by associates to be resting outside of Warsaw.
   Mazowiecki's appointment is a stunning triumph for Walesa, the
Solidarity founder who put together the plan for a Solidarity-led
coalition government with the help of minor parties once affiliated
with the Communists.
   The government statement called Mazowiecki a ``longtime Catholic
activist and former Sejm deputy'' as well as ``one of the leading
activists'' of Solidarity and editor of its weekly newspaper,
Tygodnik Solidarnosc.
   ``In the present situation, the president sees a need to create a
government enjoyin the necessary support of parliamentary floor
groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between
Poland's political and social forces,'' the statement said.
   An earlier PAP communique announced Jaruzelski's acceptance of
Communist Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak's resignation. Kiszczak,
approved as prime minister by the Sejm on Aug. 2, wanted to put
together a ``grand coalition'' led by the communists but with
participation of Solidarity.
   Instead, Walesa assembled his own parliamentary majority with the
minor Peasant and Democratic parties and asked Jaruzelski Thursday
to allow formation of a Solidarity-led government.
   In June legislative elections, Solidarity won nearly all seats
for which it was allowed to run under an accord that also resulted
in the labor movement's legalization. With that hold in the
government, the opposition was able to build its parliamentary
coalition to challenge the Communists.
   Walesa, opening the union's meeting at Solidarity national
headquarters, praised his adviser Bronislaw Geremek, who had been
among Solidarity's three candidates for prime minister, and said
Geremek would continue to function as his political adviser.
   Some union members were wary about the communist party's reaction
to the expected government changeover.
   ``The (party) of course will defend itself. It will begin to
start provocations. For the party, the greater disorder that there
is, the better, because we are appealing for calm,'' said Alojzy
Pietryk, head of Solidarity for the southern coal fields of
Jastrzebie.
   Pope John Paul II, an old friend of Mazowiecki's, smiled broadly
when asked Saturday if he was satisfied with developments in his
homeland.
   ``More or less,'' he said.
   East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia were restrained in
their coverage of the developments. In Romania, the most vehement
opponent of recent East bloc reforms, the Polish developments were
not even reported in the media.

   Fourteen rockets hit Kabul today,
injuring 18 people on the 70th anniversary of the nation's
independence from Britain.
   Foreign Minister Mohammad Nabi Amani, who gave the casualty
figure, said the 14 rockets struck mainly residential areas across
the city.
   Saturday is normally the first day of the working week in Moslem
Afghanistan, with bazaars bustling and thousands of people on the
streets of Kabul.
   But because of the independence holiday and rumors that
U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Soviet-supported
government were planning massive rocket attacks on the city, streets
were almost empty.
   The government did not mark the anniversary with a ceremony,
despite reports that President Najib would appear at an official
function.
   Kabul has been hit almost daily by rocket attacks since late June
and the guerrillas have claimed responsibility for some attacks.
   No one claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack.
   The rebels say they aim for military targets, but unofficial
estimates say 98 percent of the rockets have hit non-military
targets including schools, homes, crowded bus stops and bazaars.
   One rocket today went through the roof of the home of a family in
Karte Parwann, just blocks from the British High Commission, which
was closed before the Feb. 15 withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.
   It went through two floors, landing in the living room and
showering shrapnel on a woman who suffered injuries to the back and
right arm.
   Young boys and girls wailed hysterically and the brother of the
injured woman said the United States was responsible for the deaths
of innocent Afghans.
   ``They're killing us. Why are they killing us?'' he asked,
refusing to give his name.
   U.N. sources say 335 people were killed and more than 900 injured
in rocket attacks and a car bombing between June 25 and Aug. 12.
Virtually all were civilians.
   The Afghan government on Thursday accused the United States of
supplying the rebels with new, more deadly rockets that explode in
the air and shower small warheads over a wide area.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the rockets,
which he did not identify, had U.S. markings.
   A promised trip Friday to see pieces of the new missiles was
canceled. Deputy spokesman Naquib Sameer said the Kabul garrison
commander had destroyed the pieces because they were too dangerous.
   U.S. officials have promised new arms shipments to the mujahedeen
but have not revealed the types of weapons. Published reports say
they include cluster bombs and Spanish 120mm mortars to crater
airport runways.
   The government's commemoration of King Amanullah's treaty with
Britain in 1919 giving Afghanistan its independence was almost
non-existent. Red, black and green Afghan flags hung limply on
flagpoles in the afternoon heat and tanks were positioned at major
intersections for the first time in more than a month.
   Afghanistan gained its independence at the end of the third
Anglo-Afghan war, at a time when this rugged land-locked country was
a buffer between the two superpowers of the day, czarist Russia and
England. Najib has compared the struggle in the nation's 11-year-old
civil war with the fight by Amanullah to liberate the country.

   The nomination Saturday of Solidarity's
Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister brought cheer to customers in a
long line at a gasoline station.
   ``I am really happy. We wanted Mazowiecki from the beginning. I
trust Solidarity and Mazowiecki is an honest Catholic,'' said a
station attendent.
   ``Can't you tell I work for Solidarity? It is great! I have been
happy since the union was founded in 1980,'' said a man waiting in
his car.
   He said he was employed by Solidarity as a driver in Gdansk, the
birthplace of the free union. There was a Solidarity pennant in the
car window.
   The next man in line was an auto mechanic from Leningrad in the
Soviet Union.
   ``What do you think of a Solidarity prime minister,'' he was
asked in Polish.
   ``I don't understand,'' he replied in Russian.
   ``What do you think of a Soilidarity prime minister,'' he was
asked in Russian.
   ``It is very good, it is progress,'' he said, pointing to a
Solidarity button stuck to the dashboard.
   ``Do you keep that button there when you are in the Soviet
Union?'' he was asked.
   ``Well, no,'' he replied with a grin.
   Others in this city, where the Soviet bloc's first independent
union was established in 1980, were pleased that Communist President
Wojciech Jaruzelski had nominated the first non-Communist to head a
Polish government in four decades.
   ``It is very good news because we can hope that finally something
will get better. It is still bad, but now all those Communist Party
monopolies will disappear,'' said a surveyor.
   A high school student said, ``It takes me by surprise. The only
thing that we expected is that the prime minister could not be from
the Communist Party because society could not have accepted that.''
   Some people expressed surprise at the choice of Mazowiecki. They
said they thought Solidarity leader Lech Walesa would have selected
Bronislaw Geremek, the leader of the union's parliamentary
delegation.
   ``It is good the prime minister is from Solidarity, but I
expected Geremek because he is better known in society,'' said an
engineer.
   And there were those who had not heard of the momentous decision.
   ``I've been listening to music all night,'' said a taxi driver
waiting in the gasoline line.

   A fire destroyed a plastics recycling plant
Saturday, forced the evacuation of 600 people and threatened to
trigger an explosion at a chemical storage center before being
brought under control.
   Thirty-nine firefighters suffered minor injuries, including smoke
inhalation and inhalation of ammonium hydroxide fumes, said city
emergency management spokesman Michael Mayo.
   An explosion at the nearby Unocal-Amsco storage and distribution
center, which is filled with flammable chemicals, would have caused
widespread destruction, said city Fire Superintendent Richard
Greenberg.
   Had it not been for a new sprinkler system at the center, ``there
would be no Carteret,'' Greenberg said.
   The fire at the S&amp;A Plastics Recycling plant, whose owners had
been cited for improperly storing flammable material, broke out at
5:20 a.m. and was declared under control four hours later, Mayo said.
   Firefighters kept watch over the plant's smoldering remains
throughout the day.
   The fire also extensively damaged the neighboring H.F. Butler
steel works, Mayo said.
   About 600 residents were evacuated from homes in a 20-block area
for fear of an explosion at the chemical plant, Mayo said. They were
allowed to return around 2 p.m.
   Cartaret, an industrial city of nearly 21,000 people, is six
miles south of Newark, where a fire at a scrap metal and recycling
company Aug. 7 damaged a stretch of Interstate 78.
   Plastic drums of ammonium hydroxide stored at the Unocal center
melted and spilled the chemical. Booms were thrown across a nearby
creek to keep contaminated water from flowing into the Arthur Kill
waterway.
   About 200 firefighters battled the blaze. A Coast Guard boat in
the Arthur Kill pumped water from the waterway to the firefighters.
   The sprinkler system at the Unocal plant wasn't completely
installed, but firefighters were able to hook pipes up to a pumper
truck and spray the plant to cool it, Greenberg said.
   Greenberg said he cited S&amp;A Plastics in 1987 for storing
flammable and combustible material outside the building. He said he
fined the business $1,200, but cut the penalty in half after the
violation was addressed.
   Saturday's fire started outside the building in the same place
where S&amp;A had been cited for storing plastics and cardboard boxes,
Greenberg said.
   State and county environmental officials didn't find evidence of
toxic materials at the scene, Mayo said, although the acrid smell of
burning plastic wafted through the town.

   What would you swap for a 1953 Mickey Mantle
original? The Marriott Corp. paid $110,000 for one Saturday as the
Topps Company emptied its archives and put 35 years worth of rare
cards, proofs and pictures on the auction block.
   ``Collection fever is at an all-time high. There was tremendous
stuff in our files which had never been seen,'' Topps spokesman
Norman Liss said, explaining the company's decision to hold the
auction.
   The No. 1-priced lot involved No. 7 in Yankees pinstripes, an
original 1953 painting of Mantle used to create his cards for that
season. The Marriott Corp. had a winning bid of $110,000, said Liss.
The painting had been expected to bring $50,000.
   The artwork for Willie Mays from that year went for $80,000 to
Marriott, while the Jackie Robinson painting brought $71,000 from an
unidentified bidder.
   ``What we really wanted was Mantle and Mays together. Our
must-buys were Mantle and Mays,'' said Roger Conner of Marriott. The
hotel chain intends to show the paintings around the country for a
year, then resell then and donate the proceeds to charity, Conner
said.
   Paintings of Whitey Ford ($32,000), Bob Feller ($30,000) and Roy
Campanella ($15,000) were sold to the Rarities Group of Marlboro,
Mass., a collectibles company. Liss said 1953 was the only year
Topps used portraits instead of photos for its cards.
   ``I really wanted to buy them all, but we wound up as underbidder
on a lot of them. It's tough to bid against Marriott,'' said John
Rue, Rarities sports memorabilia buyer.
   He did take home a nice consolation prize: an autographed Mickey
Mantle jersey presented to the Yankees star when his number was
retired. The price: $30,000.
   The two-day sale marks the 51st anniversary of Topps, the
Brooklyn company that helped make the bubble-gum card an American
institution. The auction was intended to clear about 75 percent of
the company's archival holdings and collect an estimated $1 million.
   Unique lots up for auction include other original artwork and
pictures used to create the cards; uncut sheets of baseball cards
containing 60 to 120 cards; and several collector's item cards with
wrong team or player names.
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, famed for his frequent changes
of managers, is responsible for several of the collector's items.
Unreleased Yankees team cards with managers Billy Martin (1980) and
Dick Howser (1981) were up for bid; both managers were driven from
the dugout by the boss before the season started.
   In addition, there is correspondence between Topps and recent
Hall of Fame inductees Johnny Bench and Carl Yastrzemski about their
cards, and Topps card contracts signed by Mays and Mantle.
   Strips of 60 cards went for anywhere from $250 to $2,750 in early
bidding among an unusual auction crowd which opted for T-shirts and
baseball caps rather than suits or ties. Several in the crowd
chomped hot dogs during the bidding, which was done in a Manhattan
gym.
   ``This is my first one of these,'' said Dom Fallucci of
Manhattan, a card collector who was stunned by the escalating prices.
   ``I bid on one card, and then it went to $500, then $600. I put
my hand back in my pocket,'' Fallucci said. He left the auction with
``the donut hole _ zero. I got a bagel and coffee down the street,
that's it.''
   Topps has agreed to donate part of its earnings to three
charities: the Children's Museum of New York, the Special Olympics
and the Baseball Alumni Team.
   The auction was scheduled to continue Sunday, football and
basketball card memorabilia going on the block along with pen and
ink drawings from the Bazooka Joe cartoons and original artwork from
``E.T.,'' ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones'' cards.

   Historic change and daunting challenges in Poland
were bannered in the Western press Saturday but given decidedly less
coverage in the East bloc. A grinning Pope John Paul II called the
developments ``a step forward.''
   ``All that has been done is very important,'' the pontiff,
visiting Spain, said of the nomination of his friend, Solidarity
activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, as prime minister. ``It's not easy.''
   Britain's Foreign Office also welcomed the nomination. ``We trust
that this development will help Poland's progress towards democracy
and result in a government which reflects the wishes and hopes of
the Polish people,'' a statement said.
   Coverage in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria was
restrained. In Romania, where the government has been hostile to
liberalization in Poland, the events were not reported at all.
   Many Soviet newspapers carried a report from the official Tass
news agency quoting Polish Communist leaders as complaining about
the ``confrontational actions of the leaders of the opposition.''
   One of the few commentaries to appear in Soviet papers was in
Moskovskaya Pravda, where East European specialist Mikhail Tretyakov
stressed the dangers of letting Poland's government crisis drag on.
   ``The prolonging of the process of forming the government does
not further social consolidation, the establishment of order and the
removal of the country from its state of crisis,'' Tretyakov wrote.
   Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency took a more positive vein:
``Government crisis enters calmer waters,'' it said. Reports in the
Hungarian news media also were supportive.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency carried factual reports but
no commentary on the developments in Poland.
   Poland was the lead story in most French papers Saturday, with
the pointed exception of the Communist Party's L'Humanite, which put
its report on page 10.
   An editorial in the leftist Liberation newspaper said ``the
choice of a prime minister from Solidarity's ranks is beyond any
possible contest one of the most important events since Yalta. But
the road leading Poland to democracy remains long.''
   Le Figaro, in a front-page editorial, said a Solidarity-led
government ``will have only a short honeymoon.''
   Some Italian newspapers played up the role of the Catholic
church. ``Close Follower of the Pope Will be Premier in Warsaw,''
said the headline in the Communist Party daily L'Unita.
   In a front-page commentary in Corriere Della Sera of Milan,
Arrigo Levi said the ``rules of behavior'' under Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev were now more evident.
   ``But much remains unknown: do these rules really apply for all
the countries of Eastern Europe. Not only for Hungary, but also for
Czechoslovakia ... And for East Germany? In reality, we don't
know,'' Levi said.
   Britain's conservative Daily Telegraph said gradual change was
``the only way peacefully to overcome the huge economic and
political problems Poland faces.''
   The Scotsman newspaper of Edinburgh said: ``Democratic the
government might be ... but the Communist Party still provides the
bureaucracy that oils the state as well as the local government
machines.
   In Egypt, the government-owned Al-Gomhouriya reported a
``historic political coup in Poland,'' and the conservative,
English-language Saudi Gazette hailed ``a milestone of enormous
significance.''
   A front-page commentary in Vienna's respected conservative daily
Die Presse said ``the situation is unstable and unpredictable, in
the Soviet Union as well as in East Germany.
   ``Cold and stormy autumn days could quickly follow the hot
summer,'' it said.
   The U.S. government reacted cautiously to the developments in
Warsaw.
   ``We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as
appropriate and as we can,'' presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters at the summer White House in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   Asked about the State Department's cautious reaction, spokesman
Richard Boucher said, ``The State Department doesn't dance in the
streets, I'm sorry.''
   In Chicago, Polish immigrants celebrated the news of the
appontment of a Solidarity activist. But they were wary of the
intentions of Communist authorities.
   ``From what we know of the Communists, they don't give up power
without a struggle,'' said Marian Prusek of the Polish community on
the city's northwest side.

   President Bush stripped to his
trousers and dove into the chilly Atlantic on a family dare Saturday
after presenting his speedboat for a Coast Guard safety inspection.
   Bush, here for a 2{-week vacation, netted $11 for the plunge and
minute-long swim _ funds scraped together and presented to him by
two grandchildren.
   Later, the president's motorcade got stuck in bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the way home from a golf match and Bush hopped out to
kiss a bride in a horse-drawn carriage.
   The president made the unexpected dive from his dock after his
28-foot speedboat, ``Fidelity,'' underwent its annual safety check.
After receiving a safety inspection sticker for the boat, Bush made
a short public service announcement filmed by the Coast Guard.
   ``Life jackets save lives. It's best to know before you go,'' he
said.
   At that point, Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush, 42, dared his
father to jump into the drink, a small cove off the Atlantic that
laps against Bush's 11-acre compound at Walker's Point.
   ``How'd you like to be on prime time television?'' Bush asked
8-year-old twins Jenna and Barbara, George W. Bush's daughters.
   ``Better make sure you get a life jacket,'' suggested one member
of the nine-member Coast Guard Auxiliary team that inspected Bush's
boat.
   ``Don't need a life jacket,'' Bush said, plunging into the water
bare-chested.
   Bush pocketed $11 from Jenna and Barbara and then told reporters:
``You can't report it unless you put something in the pot.''
   When a photographer offered $20 if he'd jump in again, Bush asked
``seriously?'' and began unzipping a jacket he had donned upon
exiting the water.
   However, he didn't repeat the stunt.
   Bush said the water temperature had to be over 60 degrees _
chilly by swimming standards _ but the president said it was ``a
good signal for the bluefish coming in.''
   The safety inspection, which is not compulsory for boat owners,
includes a check of life jackets, boat horn, navigation lights and
safety equipment such as flares.
   In advance of the inspection, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said: ``If he flunks, there's a lot of people gonna
flunk.''
   Bush wore a life jacket for the public safety ad but seldom is
seen wearing one on his frequent boat outings.
   Still dripping wet from his impromptu swim, Bush posed with
members of the Coast Guard team and with Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner on his dock.
   Later, Bush's motorcade got caught in traffic at a checkpoint
where cars are stopped before they can drive past the Bush home, and
the president came upon a carriage carrying newlyweds Dorothy and
Ernest Sola, of Saugus, Mass.
   Bush, looking a bit tired after 18 holes of gold, got out to
greet the delighted couple and kiss the bride. As the couple exited
the checkpoint, a presidential aide caught up with them and gave
them two decks of cards and a key ring bearing the presidential
seal, saying the gifts were from Barbara Bush.

   Pop singer Melanie, who appeared at the
Woodstock rock festival here 20 years ago, gave a repeat performance
Saturday for about 10,000 people who came to commemorate the epic
event.
   ``Twice in one lifetime, what more could you want?'' Melanie, 42,
asked the audience during her 45-minute appearance at the farm once
owned by the late Max Yasgur.
   The crowd had been waiting all week for a performance by a
musician who appeared at the original Aug. 15-17, 1969, Woodstock
Music and Art Festival, which drew more than 400,000 young people.
   Sporadic showers sent thousands scurrying for cover, and some
left. Rain turned the original Woodstock into a muddy mess, but
concertgoers two decades ago endured it to hear and see their idols.
   Melanie, whose full name is Melanie Safka, sang from a makeshift
stage Saturday. She appeared the night before at a show billed as a
Woodstock reunion concert being held at a Catskill Mountains hotel.
   But the last of the three-day ``Remember Woodstock'' concerts at
the resort, which featured such Woodstock veterans as John Sebastian
and Johnny Winter, was canceled Saturday after drawing less than 400
people in two days.
   ``I think she (Melanie) wanted to be here because the vibes are
here,'' said Will Hoppey, who was helping coordinate this weekend's
entertainment at the original Woodstock site.
   ``This is where it's happening,'' he said.
   Until Melanie's performance, the closest thing at the original
site to a 1969 performer was Al Hendrix, father of late guitarist
Jimi Hendrix. Al Hendrix appeared Friday and signed autographs,
Hoppey said.
   An estimated 20,000 people converged on the site Friday night.
The celebration has attracted old hippies, their younger
counterparts, college kids and the curious.
   ``I'm fascinated by it,'' Walt Helhowski of West Milford, N.J.,
said as he videotaped the event. Helhowski, 55, and his wife had
planned a camping vacation at Swan Lake months ago, unaware of its
close proximity to Woodstock.
   Tess Tenbus, 32, who grew up 15 miles away, was selling copies of
newspaper articles detailing the events of 20 years ago. One copy, a
front-page blowup of the Aug. 17, 1969, Daily News of New York was a
reminder of what could happen if the rains continue.
   ``Hippies Mired in Sea of Mud,'' read the tabloid's headline.
   One thing different from the original concert, other than its
size, was the overall lack of garbage.
   ``Everyone is picking up their trash,'' said Tenbus.

   A car loaded with fireworks accidently
exploded Saturday in a supermarket parking lot, killing eight people
and injuring 27 others, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.
   Early reports said the explosion was a car bomb set off by Basque
terrorists, but the ministry spokesman, Agustin Valladolid, said
late Saturday that the car was filled with fireworks to be exploded
at a wedding celebration.
   ``We don't know what sparked the blast,'' Valladolid said by
telephone.
   The explosion sent shrapnel flying and killed two people in the
car, which had been on its way to a wedding, Valladolid said. All of
those who died, including a 7-year-old girl and her mother, were
Spaniards, he said.
   It was not known if any foreigners were among the wounded.
   Earlier, a paramilitary Civil Guard spokesman erroneously said
the explosion was a car bomb attack by the Basque separatist group
ETA, which seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region.
   Valladolid said the confusion arose because two men called two
local newspapers just before the blast and announced that ETA would
set off bombs in Alicante.
   The store is located in San Juan, a suburb of Alicante. Alicante
is a major Mediterranean summer resort.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, speaking
after a rock-music performance, warned some 400,000 young people
Saturday about pitfalls of materialistic life.
   ``Living in the permissiveness of the modern world ... it is easy
and attractive to breathe this contaminated mentality and to succumb
to the passing desire,'' the pontiff told youths from 55 countries.
They gathered on Mount Gozo outside Santiago for the 4th
Vatican-sponsored World Youth Day.
   As the 69-year-old pontiff watched, young dancers and singers
performed numbers to show that greed, selfishness and the pursuit of
comfort could be unattractive.
   Many people in the crowd kept time with the music, waving banners
and scarves. They applauded the performance by a singer in a gold
lame jacket who represented selfishness.
   The pope's appearance and the performances were a highlight of
the pontiff's three-day visit to Spain. He arrived Saturday and will
visit the mining region of Asturias and the mountain shrine of
Covadonga.
   On the flight from Rome to Spain John Paul spoke with reporters
about the nomination of Solidarity journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki for
prime minister of Poland.
   Mazowiecki, a personal friend of the pontiff, is expected to
organize Poland's first non-communist-led governmen in more than 40
years and the pope was asked if he was satisfied with developments
in his homeland.
   ``All that has been done is very important, a step forward,'' he
said.
   He also indicated he might go to war-ravaged Lebanon on a mission
of peace.
   John Paul said he had not received a response from Lebanese
authorities to his recent statement that he would like to visit
Lebanon but added: ``We can say a certain interest has been shown.''
   He did not elaborate but his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, said the
interest had come from various foreign ministries.
   Last week the pontiff expressed outrage at the fighting between
Lebanese Christian and Syrian-led forces and said he felt it
``imperative'' to visit the country.
   John Paul's third visit to Spain is part of an effort by the
Vatican to stem the tide of secularization. Spain's Catholic leaders
also seek the pope's assistance in reversing the decline in church
attendance in this country, which once was a bastion of the faith.
   The pope, in his remarks to the young people, denounced hedonism,
drug abuse, divorce, abortion and artificial birth control saying
they were ``in clear contrast with the law of God.''
   Marisa Schaefer, 25, of Milwaukee, said she came to Mount Gozo
``to hear what the pope had to say to young people. ... I think it's
excellent that young people show they're behind the holy father.''
   Earlier in the day, John Paul donned a traditional brown cape and
holding a pilgrim's staff, he walked along the final 300 feet of the
Way of St. James.
   Legend has it that the body of St. James washed ashore in Galicia
in northwestern Spain in a stone boat and the remains were
discovered in a tomb near Santiago in the 9th century.

<DATELINE>TANGIER, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes
celebrated his 70th birthday Saturday, welcoming nearly 1,000 guests
to Tangier's ``party of the century.''
   Resplendent in a Forbes clan kilt, Forbes stood in a receiving
line shaking hands with each of his guests, many of whom were flown
to Morocco from the United States for the weekend.
   A fleet of buses brought the guests from their Tangier hotels to
the Mendoub Chateau, Forbes' residence, and they lined up to go
through security checks and draw lots for their assignments to one
of six tents.
   At one time the line of guests extended for about 150 yards and
it took some 40 minutes to pass through the gates.
   Hundreds of Moroccan dancers and singers entertained the guests
waiting in line.
   Officials of the monarchy of King Hassan II cooperated in
organizing security and the city's main street was closed to all but
party traffic for hours before the festivities began.
   Uniformed armed guards and plainclothes men were on duty early at
the 15-acre garden of the chateau.
   The chateau, purchased in 1971 from a former royal governor of
Tangier, is on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean and the Straits
of Gibraltar. The midsummer haze on Saturday veiled the view of the
European mainland.
   Most of the guests, whose names constitute a list of the wealthy
and famous in America, were flown here in three jet planes,
including a supersonic Concorde, from New York on Friday.
   Forbes took more than 100 American and European reporters and
photographers around the garden Saturday for a last-minute view of
the arrangements, including six elaborately furnished tents set up
for tasty Moroccan specialties, belly-dancing and fireworks, and
dancing until dawn.
   While walking through the grounds, reporters asked Forbes how he
could give such a lavish party, estimated to cost more than $3
million, amid the poverty of Morocco.
   ``You don't defend it,'' Forbes replied. ``We probably all do
things in our lives that are not essential. I don't feel guilty
about it. I feel grateful we can do it.''
   His four sons and his daughter, Moira, posed for photographers
with their father. Theoretically, the children were the hosts of the
evening, but Forbes said, ``You can't really describe it as a
surprise party. My children are giving me the party, and I'm paying
for it.''
   He said he had no clear idea how much it would all cost because
``the bills are not all in.'' But he said the most costly item was
the three jets to fly most of the guests to Morocco.
   ``The catering costs considerably less than it would in the
West,'' he said. Catering manager Abdelkrim Timsamani said the total
catering bill would come to less than $750,000.
   A total of 100 sheep, 600 chickens and 1,500 eggs went into the
dishes prepared for the guests.
   With four exceptions, the guests had to draw lots to determine
who sat in which tent. Forbes assigned himself the largest tent with
the other exceptions _ the two sons of King Hassan II and actress
Elizabeth Taylor.
   Miss Taylor appeared briefly with Forbes at the end of the press
viewing. She has been a frequent companion since his 39-year
marriage ended in divorce in 1985.
   Her hair freshly done in a windswept coiffure, she smiled and
waved at photographers and, in response to their request, kissed
Forbes three times.
   The guest list included such world figures as former President
Jimmy Carter, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, real estate
magnate Donald Trump, publishers Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell and
Katherine Graham, television personalities Walter Cronkite and
Barbara Walters and former kings Constantine of Greece and Simeon of
Bulgaria.
   Miss Taylor and Forbes spent much of Friday buying jewelry and
colorful Moroccan kaftans. Forbes said his greatest birthday wish
was ``to live to be around to have many more of the things she gave
me.''
   ``The greatest of those is her passion for men,'' he added.

   A TWA jetliner with 114 passengers aboard lost
hydraulic power Saturday shortly after takeoff, and its pilot had to
lower the landing gear by hand when it returned to Lambert Airport,
an airline official said.
   In other incidents, a Northwest Airlines jumbo jet experienced a
loss of oil pressure after leaving Honolulu and another Northwest
aircraft lost power in one of two engines en route to Chicago,
officials said.
   All three planes landed safely, as did an American Airlines jet
that was diverted to Boston after losing one of its hydraulic
systems.
   In St. Louis, Flight 203 to San Diego made a safe landing about
30 minutes after its 9:40 a.m. takeoff, said TWA spokesman Don
Morrison. The pilot of the Boeing 737 reported a loss in hydraulic
power to the main landing gear, Morrison said.
   ``He manually lowered the gear, and landed routinely,'' Morrison
said.
   The 114 passengers were placed on other flights. The airplane was
back in service about 3{ hours later after workers replaced the
hydraulic line, Morrison said.
   On Friday, a TWA jet returned safely to Lambert after one of its
engines failed. A piece of the engine fell through the roof of an
auto-body shop, narrowly missing the store's manager.
   A Northwest Airlines Boeing 747 returned to Honolulu after it
started losing oil pressure in an engine shortly after taking off on
a flight to Osaka, Japan, an airline spokesman said.
   The flight, which had 400 passengers and 14 crew members aboard,
returned at 8:25 a.m., Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said by
telephone from Minneapolis, where the airline is based.
   A Northwest Boeing 757 flying from Detroit to Chicago landed at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after one of its two engines
shut down, Gibbons said. Fifty-six passengers and crew were aboard
the plane.
   An American Airlines Boeing 727 flying from Providence, R.I., to
Raleigh, N.C., with 83 passengers and a crew of seven aboard was
diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston after the
hydraulic system that controlled the plane's landing gear failed,
officials said.
   The pilot was able to switch to a backup system, and the plane
landed safely shortly after 2 p.m.
   The loss of the hydraulic system was caused by a valve
malfunction, said airlines spokeswoman Mary O'Neill.
   On July 19, a United Airlines DC-10 lost its hydraulic system and
its pilot was unable to use the landing gear when he brought the
plane down in Sioux City, Iowa. Flight 232 touched down, cartwheeled
and burst into flames, killing 111 of the 296 people aboard.

<HEAD>Unexploded World War II Bomb Leads to Closing of Leningrad Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Summer Garden park of Leningrad, lovingly laid
out by Czar Peter the Great more than two centuries ago, has been
temporarily closed because a World War II bomb has been found on its
grounds, Tass said Saturday.
   The undetonated German bomb was dropped during the 900-day siege
of Leningrad in 1941-44, the official news agency reported Saturday.
The bomb lies several yards under the park's Central Alley, and was
found during a search for the remains of a Nazi bomber, it said.
   The Germans shelled Leningrad with more than 100,000
high-explosive and incendiary bombs during the siege, Tass said.
Some failed to detonate immediately, and chances of an explosion
increase as the metal corrodes, according to Tass.
   The bomb in the Summer Garden cannot be removed, but will have to
be detonated where it lies, Tass said. Ninety statues and five
sculptures will be removed from the park, holes bored around the
bomb and liquid nitrogen pumped into the ground to freeze the metal
and contain the blast, Tass said.
   Sand and cement will also be piled atop the ground to contain the
force of the blast, Tass said. It said the bomb would be detonated
Aug. 27, and that for the moment the Summer Garden has been closed
to visitors and cordoned off by police.
   Peter the Great laid out the Summer Garden in 1706-12, soon after
he founded the new imperial capital, which he named St. Petersburg.
   The city was renamed Leningrad after the revolution that brought
the Communists to power in Russia in 1917.

<TEXT>
   A congressman from President Corazon
Aquino's coalition called for U.S. military bases in the Philippines
to be phased out during a nine-year period.
   The lawmaker, Rep. Jose de Venecia, also said Washington should
help this country prepare for the economic impact of closing the
bases during that time.
   The congressman called his plan a ``middle-ground approach''
designed to satisfy growing Filipino demands for the bases to be
closed while giving the Americans time to relocate the strategically
important installations elsewhere in the Pacific.
   De Venecia outlined the idea in a resolution submitted Wednesday
to this country's House of Representatives. A copy of the resolution
was released Saturday.
   Under the proposal, the United States would pay the Philippines
about $750 million a year for nine years. Part of the payment would
go toward construction of a munitions factory for the Philippine
military and a $150 million debt reduction plan.
   De Venecia also proposed that the United States make a separate,
one-time payment of $750 million for converting the facilities for
use by civilians.
   The United States maintains Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller facilities under an agreement that expires in
1991. The two countries are to begin talks this year on extending
the agreement.
   Mrs. Aquino refuses to say whether she will support an extension.
Any agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate, where opposition to the bases is strong amid growing
resentment of the American presence.
   In October, the United States agreed to pay $962 million over two
years to keep the bases here until 1991.
   De Venecia says his proposal is in line with a growing global
trend towards demilitarization.
   ``The withdrawal of the U.S. military facilities from the
Philippines would thus be a part, a vital part, of a univeral
process of adjustments to the requirements and challenges of the new
century,'' his resolution said.

   Rep. Mickey Leland was eulogized Saturday as a
martyr for the cause of world hunger, and mourners were urged to
honor his memory by carrying on his work.
   ``Mickey is gone, but his values and his work will live after him
in our memory and in our commitment,'' House Speaker Thomas Foley
said at a funeral Mass at St. Anne's Catholic Church.
   ``We can all do something by which to remember Mickey and to
honor his life and work,'' the Washington Democrat said. ``We can
commit ourselves to reward and serve those values and commitments
that marked Mickey's life and led to Mickey's death.'' Foley said.
   Leland, 44, was killed with 15 others Aug. 7 when their plane
crashed in Ethiopia while carrying them to a camp for Sudanese
refugees. A private burial is planned for the six-term Texas
Democrat when his remains are returned to Houston, probably some
time this week, according to family friends.
   Hundreds of people crowded under the ornately carved arches of
the central Houston church Saturday and hundreds more gathered
outside as politicians and clergymen praised Leland's work on behalf
of the starving in Africa and elsewhere.
   Leland's wife, Alison, and other family members attended the
service, along with numerous dignitaries. The Mass followed Friday's
memorial service, which drew 5,000 people.
   Bishop Joseph Fiorenza of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston read a
message delivered through the Vatican Embassy in Washington.
   Pope John Paul II, the message said, ``is well aware of
Representative Leland's great humanitarian effort to relieve the
starvation of the Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia. His holiness is
likewise grateful that his admirable concern helped to bring the
plight of these unfortunate people to the world's attention.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke forcefully during a service that
mixed the elements of a traditional Roman Catholic Mass with
jubilant gospel singing and the jazzy strains of a saxophone and
electric bass.
   There were shouts of ``Amen!'' and bursts of applause throughout
the Mass, and the crowd once roared to its feet when Jackson asked
them to applaud the late congressman.
   ``Mickey is not in that box,'' he said, motioning toward an empty
coffin, ``just as Jesus was not in that tomb.
   ``And because Mickey is not in that box and because Jesus is not
in that tomb, death has not freed us of the burden of Mickey's
mission,'' Jackson said. ``The challenge that we have today ... is
for those of us who remain to protect the integrity of Mickey's
mission.''
   Jakcson eulogized Leland again in Cincinnati at a ``family
reunion'' of blacks from Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and
Michigan. The event was one of five held across the country over the
weekend to emphasize unity among blacks.
   Jackson told a crowd estimated at 125,000 that Leland went back
to Ethiopia ``again and again and again, until God called him home,.
Mickey Leland died feeding the hungry and rebuilding bridges between
Africa and America.''
   In Houston, Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., said Leland was a
``beloved member'' of a small family _ the Congressional Black
Caucus _ and spoke solemnly of its loss.
   ``Along with Mickey we lived in a world of words. Where words
have great significance, where words have great power, where words
even have the implications of life and death,'' Dellums said.
   ``Yet, at this moment, words are so incredibly inadequate to
communicate to all of you here this incredible loss for an
extraordinary member of our family.''
   Fiorenza, a longtime friend of Leland's, said: ``He was driven to
do this (work) at tremendous personal sacrifice and personal risk,
but he was driven by their suffering and motivated by an
extraordinary compassion.
   ``This great city has lost an illustrious son. But what is more
important, every Houstonian, especially the poor, has lost a good
friend.''

<HEAD>Pakistani Foreign Minister Meets With Syrians, Discusses Hostage
Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan's foreign minister met with
Syrian officials Saturday to discuss the plight of Western hostages
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists, diplomatic sources said.
   The Pakistani official, Yaqoub Khan, met with President Hafez
Assad after a closed-door session with his Syrian counterpart,
Farouk Sharaa, the official Syrian News Agency reported. It gave no
details.
   But diplomatic sources said Khan, who flew in earlier Saturday
from Tehran, briefed Sharaa on the results of his talks in Iran on
the hostage issue.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sharaa told
Khan about efforts Syria had exerted on behalf of the hostages.
Syria has 40,000 troops in Moslem regions of Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Khan was expected to fly to Washington to discuss with President
Bush the results of his efforts.
   In Tehran, the English-language daily Tehran Times called on
Washington Saturday to take practical steps, ``rather than talk on
bettering ties with Iran.''
   While Khan was in Tehran, Iran's new president, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, was quoted by the official media as saying his country
would work for the release of Western hostages if the United States
adopts more a friendly stance toward the Islamic republic.
   Rafsanjani also told Khan that the United States should pressure
Israel to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, who was abducted July
28 from his home in south Lebanon by an Israeli commando unit.
   Obeid is the local leader of Hezbollah in south Lebanon.
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is Iran's proxy force in Lebanon. It is
believed to be an umbrella for extremists holding the foreign
hostages.
   A group calling itself The Oppressed on Earth Organization has
claimed that it hanged an U.S. Marine, Lt. Col William R. Higgins,
in retaliation for Obeid's abduction. U.S. sources say Higgins may
have been killed earlier.
   Eight Americans are among the 16 hostages that remain in
captivity. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1983.

   A Havana-bound train derailed on a bridge in
eastern Cuba Saturday, killing at least 15 people and injuring 219,
the official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said.
   The locomotive and four of the 10 cars plunged off the bridge
over the Jaibo River and fell nearly 75 feet, the report said.
   The accident took place at midday between the towns of Guantanamo
and San Luis, about 550 miles east of Havana, Prensa Latina said.
The train was about an hour out of Guantanamo when the accident
occurred, it said.
   The report gave no details of the accident, but it noted that the
accident came only 15 days after two passenger trains collided,
killing 33 and injuring 100.

   The minister said it was a traditional
Christian marriage but the wedding at a brothel east of here took
the prostitutes by surprise.
   Minister George Flint, who owns a wedding chapel and presided
over the ceremony in the Mustang Ranch's parlor, said the couple
asked a friend to find ``someplace unique'' for the wedding and led
them to it blindfolded.
   Friday night's ceremony marked the third marriage for Ronald
Scopinich, 44, and the eighth for Valerie Dodge, 47, both of
Redmond, Wash.
   ``It was a traditional Christian marriage and there were no naked
hookers,'' said Flint. ``What's the big deal?''
   Brothel owner Joe Conforte was the ring bearer and gave the bride
away. It was the first wedding at the brothel a few miles northeast
of Reno, Conforte said.
   ``I think the girls were really surprised that someone would get
married here,'' said a maid at the Mustang Ranch who asked not to be
identified. ``The girls stood around and watched it for a while but
then had to get back to work.''
   Under Nevada law, brothels can operate on a county option basis
and several rural counties do allow and license the houses of
prostitution. Brothels are not legal in Reno and Las Vegas.

<HEAD>Army Mistakes Civil Patrolmen for Guerrillas, Kills Nine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army troops searching for a band of leftist
guerrillas mistakenly opened fire on a civilian defense patrol,
killing nine people and wounding three, newspapers reported Saturday.
   The civil patrol, made up of 70 peasants, had been looking for
the same guerrillas in an area near San Cristobal Verapaz, 170 miles
north of Guatemala City, when soldiers began firing Thursday, the
newspaper reports quoted the survivors as saying.
   Defense Minister Hector Gramajo said ``apparently it was an
error.''
   ``The army is trying to get to the bottom of this matter,'' Gen.
Gramajo said.
   About 800,000 villagers organized into civil patrols by the army
rotate shifts watching for guerrillas and at times go into the
mountains to search for them.
   Villagers and human rights groups complain that the duty

   Tens of thousands of peasants were killed and more than 100,000
others fled the country in the late 1970s and early 1980s during an
army campaign to eliminate the rebel movement, which has been
fighting 29 years against military and military-backed governments.
   The rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, believed to
have fewer than 2,000 combatants, conduct sporadic attacks in the
western Guatemala.

<HEAD>51 Killed in Ethnic Violence, West German Workers Advised to Leave</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least 51 people were killed in Sri
Lanka's ethnic warfare in a two-day period, and the West Germany
Embassy advised West Germany citizens working in some areas to leave
the country.
   Military officials said Saturday that 37 of those killed since
Thursday were slain in central and southern Sri Lanka in attacks
involving Sinhalese extremists.
   Most of the other killings occurred in northern Sri Lanka, where
separatists in the Tamil minority have been battling for six years
for their own homeland.
   West Germany has been providing funds for six agriculture and
rural development projects in central Sri Lanka, and a West German
Embassy spokeswoman said the government has advised German workers
at those projects to return home.
   Anna Otto-Hallensleben said she did not have the number of
Germans told to leave the country but the ``six projects represent
around one-fifth of the number of West German projects funded in Sri
Lanka.
   ``The agencies feel if the workers cannot perform satisfactorily
they should return ... but they will come back if the situation
improves.''
   West Germany is the first country to advise its nationals to
leave Sri Lanka since the ethnic conflict intensified in recent
weeks. Earlier this month, the United States said Americans should
avoid unnecessary travel to Sri Lanka.
   It is estimated that the Tamil revolt has claimed 11,000 lives,
mainly in northeastern Sri Lanka, since 1983.
   India brokered a peace agreement in 1987 that called on the Tamil
guerrillas to stop fighting in exchange for limited autonomy in the
northeast. India sent more than 40,000 troopers to enforce the
cease-fire.
   But the largest Tamil guerrilla group rejected the plan. Militant
Sinhalese claimed the accord granted too many concession to the
Tamils and began a violent campaign against the Sinhalese-dominated
government.
   Sinhalese militants of the People's Liberation Front are blamed
for 4,000 killings in central and southern Sri Lanka since June 1987
when the first Indian troops arrived.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
population of 16 million and accuse the Buddhist Sinhalese majority
of discrimination.

   An estimated 10,000 people marched through
Dublin to the British Embassy Saturday demanding the withdrawal of
British troops from Northern Ireland.
   About 500 police stood guard at barriers in front of the embassy
and the marchers stopped there for a rally.
   Among those in the front of the march was Gerry Adams, leader of
Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army.
   Police blocked the marchers 100 yards from the embassy and also
worked to prevent trouble between the anti-British demonstrators and
about 30,000 people who were in the area for a nearby concert of the
rock group Simple Minds.
   No violence was reported.
   Adams told the rally, ``The last 20 years of British military
occupation in the north is the tip of the iceberg of repression and
British military and political failure.''
   Britain sent troops into Northern Ireland, a British province, in
1969 to try to stop sectarian fighting between Roman Catholic and
Protestant extremists.
   Guerrillas of the mainly Catholic Irish Republican Army are
fighting to unite the province, where Protestants outnumber
Catholics 3-2, with predominantly Catholic Ireland.

   Police arrested 11 demonstrators
Saturday and confiscated clubs, knives and shackles to prevent
violence at a rally marking the second anniversary of the death of
Nazi Rudolf Hess.
   About 300 right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis gathered to mark
the Aug. 17, 1987, death of Hess, a deputy to Adolf Hitler, who
killed himself at Spandau prison in Berlin at age 93.
   Hess had spent more than four decades in prison and never
repented his crimes after conviction at the Nuremberg trials in 1947.
   The late Nazi is buried in a cemetery in this Bavarian town near
the border with Czechoslovakia, and his gravesite was presumed to be
the rallying point for right-wing extremists.
   But police sealed off the area and arrested 11 men carrying
illegal weapons or wearing Nazi-like uniforms, a police spokesman
said. The others were allowed to rally.
   Social Democratic Party politicians held a counter-rally on
Friday night, and party parliamentarian Ludwig Stiegler told about
500 participants that ``right-wing extremists have no rights to
demonstrate.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities from four European
nations Saturday boarded an offshore rock 'n' roll radio station in
international waters on the North Sea and forced it to close, Dutch
television reported.
   The crackdown on Radio Caroline followed complaints that the
privately owned station disrupted ship-to-shore radio communications
on one of Europe's busiest shipping lanes, according to the
television report.
   Radio Caroline, an English-language rock station broadcasting
mainly for British and Dutch listeners, was one of three stations
using the Ross Revenge transmitter ship anchored in international
waters off the Dutch coast, the report said.
   Dutch, British, French and Belgian authorities went aboard the
ship Saturday while Radio Caroline was on the air and impounded
record players and transmission equipment, the report said.
   Radio Caroline was using the offshore transmitter to avoid
restrictive media controls in Britain and the Netherlands.
   Under maritime law, authorities do not normally have the right to
board ships in international waters. The television report said
authorities regarded it as legal to board the Ross Revenge because
the ship wasn't flying a flag and could therefore be considered
stateless.
   Included in the report was a fragment of Radio Caroline's last
broadcast, with an unidentified disc jockey saying ``It's the
saddest day of my life ... Radio Caroline, we love you too much to
leave you forever.''

   Seventy-nine skydiving women joined in a

had snapped the previous mark.
   ``It's raining maniac women,'' Dave Simons of Stormville said as
the women parachuted down Friday afternoon near the Orange County
Airport nearly 50 miles northwest of New York City.
   The first group took to the air in three Caribou planes, and
broke the previous record of 60 women set in Deland, Fla., in 1986,
by linking and holding the chain for 20.23 seconds.
   Three hours and 20 minutes later, all 73 plus six others went up
again and linked for 13.11 seconds, setting the new record for the
number of women forming a chain.
   Videotapes of the feats will be sent to the Federale
Aereonautique Internationale in Paris, an international
record-sanctioning body, for finalization of the records.
   ``My goal in life is achieved. I've made everyone happy,'' said
organizer Sandra Williams, who lost a parachute in one of the jumps
and had to use her reserve.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Saturday appealed to
thousands of blacks gathered at a ``family reunion'' to register to
vote and to help fight drug abuse.
   Jackson, who arrived here after addressing a funeral mass for
Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, in Houston, spoke to an estimated
125,000 people, most of them blacks, from Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio at Sawyer Point Park Center.
   Jackson encouraged everyone in the crowd to register to vote,
adding that blacks have died for the right to cast ballots. ``If you
stand here today unregistered to vote, you're throwing a rock at
their tombstones,'' said the former Democratic presidential
candidate.
   He also made a plea for those in the crowd to enlist in the war
against drugs.
   ``Our families are being destroyed by drugs,'' he said. ``You
cannot reconcile family with drugs.''
   A Saturday morning parade downtown preceded the afternoon
gathering.
   The turnout for the gathering was more than double the 50,000
expected, organizers said.
   The ``reunion,'' one of five held across the country to emphasize
unity among blacks, offered advice on overcoming problems faced by
black families and attempted to strengthen ties beyond the immediate
family.
   ``What we have here is a vast wealth of acquired knowledge from
our elders,'' said Ben Jordan, a 23-year-old college student who
heard Jackson's speech. ``We have people here that can teach and
it's a crime that anyone should miss it.''
   The reunion, to conclude Sunday, is the fourth of five such
events across the nation this summer. Earlier reunions took place in
Atlanta, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. The last is scheduled in
Washington for next month.

<HEAD>Arafat Says U.S.-PLO Dialogue Deadlocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Saturday that
the 8-month-old dialogue with the United States is deadlocked and
the stalemate could fuel the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Arafat told a news conference that the Bush adminstration insists
that the Palestinians accept Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
election plan for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``They want us to accept the Shamir plan, which is nothing but a
plot aimed at ending'' the 20-month-old uprising in the territories,
Arafat said.
   The lack of progress in the U.S.-PLO talks could result in the
uprising becoming a ``nationwide rebellion ... and we may take
another step after the rebellion,'' he said without elaboration.
   Shamir's plan calls for the Palestininans to elect
representatives who then would negotiate with Israel some form of
limited autonomy for the territories. But Israel will not deal with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, saying it is a terrorist
organization.
   The PLO has rejected the plan, claiming it is designed to abolish
Palestinian aspirations for a homeland.
   It also has said any elections in the territories should be held
after Israel withdraws and under international supervision.
   In December, the United States ended a 13-year ban on dealings
with the PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, was then
authorized to open talks with the organization, and the two sides
held a fourth round Monday.
   Arafat was in Baghdad for a meeting Friday with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and Jordan's King Hussein on the conflict in Lebanon
between Lebanese Christians and Syrian-led forces. There were
unconfirmed reports that the three leaders agreed to press for an
emergency Arab summit to discuss Lebanon.
   Arafat called on the Arabs to send a peacekeeping force to stop
what he called the ``slaughter and crimes against the Lebanese.''
   He said Syria is responsible for the latest round of violence in
Lebanon, which erupted in March and has claimed more than 780 lives.
Syria has supported anti-Arafat Palestinian groups.
   Arafat was asked if he expected any foreign intervention in
Lebanon and replied, ``There is a vacuum now in Lebanon and if they
(the Arabs) don't fill it, others will.''

<TEXT>
   A minor earthquake rumbled through
northwest Alabama and a Tennessee town Saturday evening, shaking
houses and rattling nerves, authorities said.
   ``It sounded like a big explosion and then the ground shook for
two or three seconds,'' police officer Donald Coon said in the
northwest Alabama city of Muscle Shoals, which is five miles
southeast of Florence. ``You could feel it coming.''
   The quake, which occurred at 7:03 p.m. and was centered 15 miles
south of Florence, measured 3.9 on the Richter scale, said Wavery
Person, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information
Service in Golden, Colo.
   Earthquakes in the area are infrequent, Person said.
   Coon said people within a 15-mile radius of Muscle Shoals
reported feeling the quake. The tremor was also felt in Iron City,
Tenn., just north of the Alabama line, said Joanna Kennemer of the
Tennessee Highway Patrol.
   No injuries were reported, but police officials said they were
inundated with telephone calls from worried residents.
   Coon said that after the quake hit, the phone began ``tearing off
the wall.''
   ``People said it shook their house and their windows real bad,''
he said.
   The quake cracked bricks on a house and caused a crack in the
basement of another home in Colbert County, which includes Muscle
Shoals, said county emergency coordinator Eddy Hicks.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage, and a quake of 4 on the scale can cause moderate damage.

<TEXT>
   A longtime NAACP leader won re-election
Saturday to head the civil rights group's Alabama chapter, making
him the only state president to win office after a felony
conviction, officials said.
   Thomas Reed, who is appealing a 1988 federal extortion
conviction, said his winning another two-year term indicates the
National Association for the Advancemennt of Colored People is
``ungodly proud'' of his leadership.
   ``Just a month ago I was re-elected to the national board of
directors, and I think that's the litmus test,'' Reed said. ``Of
course, this test in Alabama was a true demonstration of the
people's choice.''
   Reed turned back a bid by the Rev. William Battle, head of the
NAACP's Metro-Birmingham Chapter. Battle ran on a platform of
bringing unity to the state chapters and of increasing membership.
   ``We have a lot of inactive branches,'' Battle said. ``Alabama is
at the bottom of all of the states as it relates to membership.''
   Battle was defeated by an 81-35 vote of NAACP delegates at the
Alabama state convention. Battle estimated there are about 7,000
members in the Alabama chapter.
   Jim Williams, a national spokesman for the NAACP in Baltimore,
said earlier this week that Reed's victory would make him the only
sitting state president to be re-elected after a felony conviction.
   Reed, 61, was convicted of of accepting $10,000 cash and between
$5,000 and $10,000 in restaurant equipment to win early parole for a
state prisoner. He was given a four-year prison sentence but has
been free on bond pending his appeal.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is considering
Reed's appeal. His attorneys say Reed, who predicts he will be
vindicated, should get a new trial because a jury heard about his
attempts to remove the Confederate flag from the Alabama Capitol.
   Reed has been state NAACP president for 19 years, with one
two-year break in service. Before Reed's re-election, the delegates
to the convention rejected a resolution by NAACP divisions in five
counties calling for him not to seek re-election.
   Reed also served as a state representative from Tuskegee with the
Alabama Legisature.

   A tropical depression that formed off the coast of
Africa posed no danger to land Saturday as it pushed its way across
the far eastern Atlantic Ocean, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of the disturbance was located near
19.1 degrees north latitude and 34.5 degrees west longitude, or
about 600 miles northwest of the Cape Verde Islands off Africa.
   The tropical system carried winds of 35 mph as it moved
west-northwest at about 15 to 20 mph.
   Little change in strength or motion was expected in the next 12
to 24 hours, said forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   Tropical depressions become named storms if their sustained winds
reach 39 mph, and hurricanes if the winds increase to 74 mph.
   The depressions watched by forecasters is the seventh of the
Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Four
strengthened enough to become named storms and two of those became
hurricanes.
   If the newest depression becomes the fifth named storm, it will
be called Tropical Storm Erin.

   Zoos, exhibits and reptile breeders all over the
United States and Canada are bidding for a 20-foot python found
under a home after reportedly having slithered around the
neighborhood for years.
   The animal catcher who helped bag the 250-pound snake said Friday
his prize catch won't necessarily go to the highest bidder.
   ``We want to put it where it will receive the best treatment,''
said Todd Hardwick, owner of Pesky Critters Relocation in suburban
Miami, who noted the snake will probably go for about $1,000.
   Hardwick wouldn't name the bidders, but he said they include four
or five of the biggest zoos in the country. The snake now resides in
a special box built to contain its bone-crushing strength.
   On Thursday, Hardwick and three other men wrestled the snake from
underneath a Fort Lauderdale home. Residents say they've seen the
snake gobble down raccoons ``like marshmallows'' in a nearby park.
   Hardwick believes the snake is the largest ever captured in South
Florida, where many exotic pets are illegally released into the wild.
   The reticulate python, a native of southeastern Asia and
Indonesia, can grow to more than 30 feet. Though not venomous, the
snake coils around its prey to stop the breathing and blood flow of
its victims.

   Nothing in his 23 years as an air traffic
controller for the Federal Aviation Adminstration prepared Terry
Dobson for what he experienced July 19 when he and seven others
helped guide a United Airlines DC-10 to an emergency landing in
Sioux City, Iowa, last month.
   ``I don't know how you can ever train for a situation of this
magnitude,'' said Dobson, 47, the air traffic manager at Sioux
Gateway Airport.
   ``When you witness something like that, the emotions and so on
that you go through ... you'll never forget,'' he said.
   Cool heads prevailed in the control tower but tensions grew as
seven air traffic control personnel guided Flight 232 after it lost
its hydraulic control, he said.
   ``The tension had run very high and, of course, the tower became
very quiet'' as the disabled plane dove toward the airport, Dobson
said at a Friday news conference during which the FAA released the
tape recording of the conversation between the Sioux City control
tower and Flight 232.
   ``I think it kind of turned to jubilation from the standpoint
that it appeared to us that Capt. Haynes and his crew had got the
airplane to the airport,'' he said.
   Dobson said that when the plane made a crash-landing, ``I think
most of the folks up there (in the tower) were just thanking the
good Lord that that airplane made it to the airport where all the
emergency help was.''
   Of the 296 people aboard the DC-10, 111 were killed when the
plane en route from Denver to Chicago and Philadelphia crashed and
burst into a ball of fire.
   ``I know there's some tension that built right away at the point
where the crew came over to us and told us about their hydraulic
problems,'' said Mark Zielezinski, area supervisor in the Sioux City
tower.
   ``The more people on board to help coordinate things and keep
things smooth in the tower was going to be to our advantage,'' said
Zielezinski, 36, who has worked as an air traffic controller for 11
years.
   Immediately after the landing ``there was not a controller in
that tower who was not back doing his job and doing it very
professionally,'' said Dobson.
   ``At no time was there ever a sign that anyone failed to do their
job,'' he said.
   One week after the DC-10 crash, Dobson and his colleagues were
faced with another emergency landing when a twin-engine turbo-prop
plane owned by Northwest Airlines lost its left engine.
   ``In light of what had happened one week to the day previous to
that, the folks in the tower cab ... the adrenalin pumped a little
harder. But they (the controllers) had a job to do and it was done
very professionally and it had a happier ending.''
   The plane landed safely.
   Since then, tensions in the Sioux City control tower have
subsided, Dobson said. ``We're getting pretty well back to normal.
What is normal after something like that happens?''

<TEXT>
   Exxon released plans Friday for winter
operations in Prince William Sound and said ``capabilities'' to
carry out more oil-spill cleanup work will be available in the
spring.
   Exxon has cleaned more shoreline miles than it anticipated last
spring when its plan for cleanup of the March 24 oil spill in the
sound was announced, Otto Harrison, Exxon's general manager in
Valdez, said at a news conference.
   He said Exxon is prepared over the winter to respond to problems
and will continue scientific studies.
   Weather permitting, the company plans to put key scientific
personnel on heavily affected beaches every two weeks during the
winter so that remaining effects of oil spilled from the Exxon
Valdez can be examined. The ship struck a reef in Prince William
Sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil.
   Harrison said the level of resumed operations in the spring is
unclear. The company has been under pressure from the state to make
an unequivocal commitment that crews will be on the job again in
1990, but Exxon has said only that it will abide by reasonable
requests from the Coast Guard.
   ``I don't know what its going to look like in 1990,'' Harrison
said. ``I honestly don't know what it will look like in the spring.
I think the capabilities to do things will be here, but I don't know
what we'll have to do.'' Scientific studies over the winter will
``help us to understand what we can realistically expect to find
here next spring.''
   Gov. Steve Cowper called Exxon's winter plan inadequate. The
company made ``a major effort to clean oil from the surface of
beaches affected by the spill, but winter efforts should be
strengthened,'' he said.
   ``There's still a lot of oil below the surface, there's a lot of
oil on the beaches and there's a lot of oil in the water,'' the
governor said. ``We think that oil ought to be cleaned up as best as
it can.''
   Alaska Commissioner of Environmental Conservation Dennis Kelso
described the winter plan as ``a blizzard of numbers. You can
calculate numbers all day long, but that doesn't get the beaches any
cleaner.''
   The state's proposals include continued treatment of shorelines
after Exxon's pullout, most of which will occur by mid-September.
Small, well-equipped crews could work in sheltered areas until the
onset of severe weather, state officials said.
   Exxon's spill response has involved more than 13,000 people, more
than 3,000 of them beach clean-up workers.
   Exxon plans to keep about 300 employees in Alaska during the
winter, but the organization's headquarters will be moved from
Valdez to Anchorage. Six Exxon community liaison offices and seven
claims offices will remain open over the winter. Demobilization
began Friday.
   ``The first five of 1,700 container loads are on their way to
Anchorage,'' Harrison said. ``We're in the process of moving surplus
material out of the yard right now.''
   Harrison said Alaska's largest city is the only place with enough
warehouse space for work such as the cleaning and repair of
oil-containment boom.
   Exxon's objective is to leave shorelines ``environmentally
stable,'' but its ability to finish the job could be hampered by
weather and if the Coast Guard does not approve use of the chemical
compound COREXIT 9580.
   Critics of the compound say too little is known about its
effects. Harrison said Exxon on Thursday again sought the Coast
Guard's permission to use the substance on heavily oiled beaches.
   As of Tuesday, more than 900 miles or shoreline along Prince
Willaim Sound and the Gulf of Alaska had been treated, he said.
According to Exxon, 80 miles along the sound and 80 miles of gulf
shores still require treatment.
   State officials have said many of the treated beaches remain
badly contaminated and need more work.
   Harrison said three ``major vessels'' assigned to the spill will
be withdrawn by Nov. 1. Oil-containment boom will be kept on hand in
case fish hatcheries in the sound need protection, he said. Other
aircraft and vessels will be stationed elsewhere in Alaska.

   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission report
released Friday criticized Seabrook nuclear plant operators for
delaying a shutdown, despite the urging of NRC officials, when a
valve failed during low-power testing.
   Plant operators reacted in an ``unacceptable'' way to the
equipment failure, although the malfunction was not a significant
safety lapse, the NRC reported. It said pre-test staff training
apparently was inadequate.
   The commission's staff also rejected a motion by Seabrook
opponents to reopen hearings on the plant's low-power license
because of the June 22 testing incident.
   The Massachusetts attorney general's office, the New England
Coalition on Nuclear Pollution and the Seacoast Anti-Pollution
League have asked that the license be suspended and authorization
for a full-power license be withheld until a hearing can be held.
   Massachusetts has opposed the plant on behalf of state
communities within 10 miles of the plant's safety zone.
   The plant stopped the tests when a steam valve malfunctioned in a
non-nuclear part of the plant.
   The NRC said control room operators failed to follow procedures,
waiting nearly five minutes after the part failed to shut down the
plant, although an NRC inspection team present urged them to do so.
   The NRC, in a report issued by its regional office in King of
Prussia, Pa., said the equipment failure and delayed shutdown ``did
not significantly challenge the plant margin to safety. However, the
operational practice exhibited by the personnel in the control room
was unacceptable.''
   The report said the operating staff otherwise performed well and
it called control room supervisors ``highly competent individuals.''
   In an 81-page report sent to the NRC by Seabrook top executive
Edward Brown in July, plant officials admitted they initially
underestimated the seriousness of the incident.
   Brown said in a statement Friday that his earlier report was
consistent with the NRC's findings. He reiterated that plant
officials accept full responsibility for ``unacceptable and
inappropriate personnel performance.''
   He said the plant management has taken ``major corrective
actions'' since the incident. One Seabrook executive was fired,
other employees were reprimanded and some others were given new
assignments after the incident.
   The NRC reported that the valve apparently was not given a final
test before the low power trials began.
   The NRC scheduled two hearings to discuss the findings: a public
meeting Sept. 6 at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, and a
closed enforcement conference Sept. 7 at the NRC office in King of
Prussia to determine whether Seabrook operators violated commission
regulations.
   The staff opinion rejected opponents' contention that stopping
the low-power tests was equivalent to starting a proceeding to
suspend the license, and said halting testing did not involve a
fundamental flaw in Seabrook's operational training or its low-power
testing program.
   The opinion was signed by Edwin Reis, deputy assistant general
counsel of the NRC's reactor licensing branch in Rockville, Md.

<TEXT>
   The Utah Supreme Court late Friday denied
two appeals from the nation's longest-standing death row inmate, who
faces execution on Tuesday for his role in the 1974 torture-slayings
of three people.
   William Andrews' petition to the state's high court, which
included claims that he had a biased, all-white jury, and was
victimized by false testimony, was rejected by five justices as
without merit.
   Earlier Friday, the state Board of Pardons refused on a vote of
2-1 to commute his sentence to life in prison, and U.S. District
Judge David Sam denied Andrews' request for a stay of execution.
   The high court also ruled against Andrews' appeal of the pardons
board's denial of clemency.
   Barring a stay of execution from one of several still pending
appeals in federal court, Andrews, 34, will die by injection Tuesday
morning, shortly after midnight. For nearly 15 years he has been on
death row.
   His co-defendant, Pierre Dale Selby, was executed in August 1987.
   Andrews and Selby, both airmen at Hill Air Force Base, were
convicted of killing two women and a man during the robbery at the
Ogden Hi-Fi Shop. One woman was raped by Selby before he shot the
five victims in the head.
   Earlier Friday, pardons board Chairman H.L. Haun said he and
panel member Edward Kimball decided that although Selby fired the
shots that killed the three and wounded two others, Andrews' help in
forcing the victims to drink a liquid drain cleaner and his
knowledge they would be killed made the death sentence appropriate.
   The aggravating circumstances of the crime known as the ``Hi-Fi
murders'' far outweighed any mitigating factors, Haun said.
   Haun said Andrews and Selby forced their bound victims to drink
the drain cleaner and when they did not die ``quickly enough''
decided to kill them.
   ``Mr. Andrews waited outside (the store) while this took place,
but he left his loaded pistol for Mr. Selby to use,'' he said. ``Mr.
Andrews knew of Mr. Selby's intent and shared in it.''
   Two men survived, including Orren Walker, whose son was one of
those killed. Walker testified at Andrews' and Selby's commutation
hearings and was present Friday.
   Defense attorneys were expected to appeal Sam's decision to the
10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where they already have a
pending appeal of his rejection of Andrews' companion civil rights
appeal.
   A third 10th Circuit judge arrived Friday to complete the panel
needed for a hearing on the appeals set for 2 p.m. Saturday, said
court clerk Bob Hoecker in Denver.
   In the appeals, Andrews contends his constitutional rights were
violated by being forced to accept as a public defender an
inexperienced attorney, and a judge's failure to instruct the jury
it could convict Andrews of second-degree murder.
   The appeals also raised again the argument that a mistrial should
have been declared for Selby and Andrews when a juror found a note
bearing the words, ``Hang the niggers.''

   Herbert Lee Richardson, put to death Friday
for the 1977 pipe-bomb slaying of an 11-year-old girl, never saw
Alabama's electric chair in an execution that avoided the foulup of
the state's last one.
   State Prison Commissioner Morris Thigpen said that Richardson had
requested he be blindfolded from the time he left the holding cell
adjacent to the execution room at 11:57 p.m. Thursday.
   ``He never saw the execution chamber,'' Thigpen said in a news
conference after the post-midnight execution.
   Thigpen also witnessed Alabama's last execution July 14, when it
took two surges of electricity to execute Horace Franklin Dunkins
Jr. because the electric chair was wired wrong and the first surge
failed to kill him.
   Thigpen kept an open telephone line from the prison to Gov. Guy
Hunt's office in case of a last minute stay.
   Richardson, 43, was pronounced dead at 12:14 a.m., six minutes
after the switch was thrown, said state Department of Corrections
spokeswoman Debbie Herbert.
   He was convicted in the death of 11-year-old Rena Mae Callins of
Dothan, whose body was blown apart on the porch of her home when she
picked up a pipe bomb and it detonated. Richardson, whose
relationship with the girl's aunt recently had broken up, said he
only meant to scare the family.
   The execution was carried out after the U.S. Supreme Court
followed the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and U.S.
District Judge Robert Varner in Montgomery in refusing Richardson's
request for a stay Thursday. Gov. Guy Hunt earlier refused to grant
clemency.
   Richardson, blindfolded and dressed in his prison whites, was
strapped in the yellow chair while he listened to Holman Prison
Warden Charlie Jones read the death warrant.
   ``I have no ill feeling and hold nothing against anyone,''
Richardson said in a final statement after the death warrant was
read.
   Richardson was executed with 1,800-volt charge of electricity and
doctors pronounced him dead.
   Richardson was the 159th person to be electrocuted in Alabama's
chair. He was the sixth inmate put to death in the state since the
U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976.
   In disposing of his personal effects, Richardson wrote a detailed
list Thursday of items to be left to ``my beloved wife,'' whom he
married in a prison ceremony last week, and to fellow death row
inmate Earl Jerome McGahee, who had an adjacent cell.
   Among the items Richardson gave to his wife were a 19-inch color
television, 13 packs of cigarettes, 55 matchbooks, a Bible, legal
transcripts from his trial, a broken hairbrush, $4.42 from his
prison account and a Bible.
   Thigpen said that Richardson's body would be taken to the state
forensics laboratory in Mobile for an autopsy. He said Richardson
would be buried on the Holman Prison grounds.
   ``When the body is not claimed by family, that's the procedure,''
Thigpen said. ``She (Mrs. Richardson) had indicated that she did not
have the means to take care of a private funeral.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's nothing for which Uncle Sam can take a bow,
but the gentleman's tendency to complicate once-simple matters has
helped spur an innovative, creative, opportunistic industry.
   Oddly, the spurring was done not through any great enterprise or
financial infusion by the old codger, but by bludgeoning existing
businesses with such onerous paperwork burdens they had to do
something or die.
   As a result, employee leasing is swiftly becoming one of those
phenomena they call a wave of the future. It had 5,000 employees six
years ago. Today, it has at least 500,000. By 1992, it probably will
reach 4 million.
   Its fast growth can be attributed partly to the busy governmental
bureaucracy, to the complicated regulations emanating from
Washington and state offices that drive small-business people to
distraction, if not madness.
   Faced with this reality, some businesses ``fire'' their
employees. The discharged workers stay in place; they join a leasing
company. The leasing company pays them. Their old company pays the
leaser.
   In return, the leasing company processes the payroll, signs the
checks, reconciles the checking account, handles the IFCA, FUTA and
SUTA taxes and the W-2 forms, figures the insurance claims, deals
with Sec. 125 benefits deductions and Section 89 and COBRA
compliance and administration...
   These details have been known to drive little companies out of
business. They are the talk of any conference of small-business
people. The small-business press anguishes over them, the common
complaint being that fulfillment of all the requirements leaves no
time for running a business.
   In this way did Uncle Sam, quite inadvertently, provide
inspiration and support to the leasing industry. In effect, he
created a new area of demand that demanded the abilities of a
specialist, which is the employee leaser.
   Altogether, there are about 500 employee leasing companies in the
United States, half of them in the populous states of California,
Florida, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.
   Most are very small. The largest, Action Staffing, Inc., of
Tampa, Fla., has 400 clients and 11,000 employees in 23 states. Some
have cooperative arrangements. Those in the National Staff Network,
Encino, Calif. involve 30,000 leased workers. Typical of emerging
industries, franchising is a factor.
   David Miller, Action chairman, looks for growth not just from
frustrated business people who want to rid themselves of paperwork
but from what he views as a trend to greater entrepreneurship.
   ``There's been a direct correlation between our growth and the
phenomenal increase of small business during the 1980s,'' he says.
The early 1980s recession drove many people to try their hand at
business. More recently, he says, corporate downsizing, with
resulting layoffs, has spurred activity.
   While the industry views the four million businesses of fewer
than 50 workers as its prime market, it might eventually target
larger companies also.
   ``There are administrative nightmares for larger companies too,''
says Miller, whose customers have included divisions of GTE, Ramada
and Greyhound. Among the nightmares are regulations and compliance
that differ state to state.
   Those federal regulations, however, are the big factor. For
example, COBRA, the Consolidated Omininbus Budget Reconciliation Act
that says terminated workers may continue their health insurance;
and IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which
creates new legal obligations for employers.
   One of the very toughest is Section 89 of the 1989 tax act, which
compels corporations to prove they are conferring benefits equally
on all employees. Ask a small-business person about that one and
you'll receive more than a bland response. Some prefer to pay the
penalties rather than fill out forms.
   It often takes a specialist _ more accurately, a firm of many
specialists in different areas _ to handle such burdens. Small
business especially, and some big ones too, say they have better
things to do with time and manpower.
   Such as surviving.

<HEAD>Gay Atlantans Emerging as Political Force</HEAD>

   Atlanta has long been a magnet for homosexuals in
the Southeast who felt they'd never be accepted in smaller towns.
   ``It's a little island of enlightenment in a sea of bigotry,''
said Gil Robinson, a lobbyist for several Atlanta gay groups.
   They've never been forced to take to the streets to fight for
equality here, but with an estimated 300,000 homosexuals in the
metropolitan area, the gay community has become a well-organized,
potent political force. Nowhere has that been more apparent than in
the race to succeed Mayor Andrew Young.
   ``I think gay and lesbian people here are becoming a real
political power, probably getting close to New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles,'' said Richard Swanson, administrator of the
Atlanta Gay Center.
   Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax and former Mayor
Maynard Jackson, the two leading Democratic candidates in the Oct. 3
election until Lomax dropped out this month, vigorously campaigned
in the gay community.
   Both had detailed platforms on gay issues, promising to seek
funds for housing for people with AIDS, to appoint gay men and
lesbians to city posts and to establish police task forces to combat
unprovoked assaults on homosexuals.
   The city's gay population has never before been courted so
openly, said Jeffrey Laymon, executive secretary of the Metropolitan
Atlanta Council of Gay and Lesbian Organizations. ``We do have the
numbers now. The political situation has changed. They have to pay
attention.''
   Even those who oppose affirmative-action programs inclusion of
homosexuals agree that Atlanta's gay population has developed some
muscle.
   ``I think it's anti-family and it's anti-God,'' said Nancy
Schaefer, chairwoman of Citizens for Public Awareness, which has
fought to repeal a city ordinance amendment giving gay residents
protection from discrimination. Atlanta has become a ``haven'' for
homosexuals, she said.
   Unlike San Francisco or New York, the rise of gay power here came
not with a surge of militancy, but rather gradually. Gay activism
surfaced in America in the early 1970s and by the time Atlanta's
homosexual population reached significant numbers much of the work
had already been done.
   ``By 1980, attitudes about equality had already changed or
moderated across the country,'' Swanson said. ``There probably
wasn't a great need to get out and march. We're able to achieve much
more with a lower-key approach.''
   He cited Atlanta's status as a center of the civil rights
movement and its Southern gentility for the lack of confrontation
over gay issues.``A lot of gay and lesbian people tend to be from
the smaller towns in the South. They still have a lot of that
traditional Southern mentality.''
   Midtown Atlanta, a hodgepodge of high-rise office towers,
comfortable neighborhoods, nightclubs and shopping centers, is the
center of gay life. But it's a lifestyle that has been quietly woven
into the city's society.
   ``We're invisible,'' said Marie Murray of the Greater Atlanta
Political Awareness Committee, GAPAC. ``We don't just care about gay
issues. We're interested in all of the issues that everybody else
is.''
   Still, many gay activists say their greatest victory was the 1986
addition of sexual orientation to an anti-discrimination ordinance.
It has survived one repeal effort; CPA is trying again to have the
amendment thrown out.
   Mrs. Schaefer said she does not believe a sexual preference group
should be considered a minority, particularly in affirmative action
programs. She does believe that heightened gay political power bodes
ill for the city.
   ``It concerns me where the city is heading. When the morals of
the city start falling apart, we will suffer the consequences,'' she
said, adding that the suburbs will become conservative in reaction
to gay clout within the city.
   Many gay men and lesbians own prosperous businesses _ with money
to contribute to politicians _ and are active in one or more of the
dozens of gay and lesbian organizations that rate politics high on
their agenda.
   Jackson campaign spokesman Angelo Fuster said the gay population
is ``very important'' in building a successful coalition with
Atlanta's black majority to win a citywide election. And many
politicians no longer fear a backlash if they openly support gay
issues. ``Although there is a lot of homophobia, it has lessened
considerably,'' he said.
   Lomax recently reached out for the gay vote with a proposal to
include gay-owned businesses in a study of Fulton County's
affirmative action program.
   Les Hough, a specialist in Southern politics at Georgia State
University, said the proposal shows the role gay voters _ especially
white ones _ play in predominantly black Atlanta. ``By appealing to
the margins, to the single-issue groups, you can solidify your white
support,'' he said.
   ``In a close race, it can make a big difference.''
   The prominence of gay issues in Atlanta shows the differences
between city and country in Georgia, where no gubernatorial
candidates mention gay rights as an important platform plank, he
said. ``Anyone who had ambitions of statewide office in Georgia ...
would downplay gay rights issues in any race.''
   Swanson said gay men and lesbians have simply become part of the
fabric of Atlanta, coming of age along with the fast-growing city.
``A high percentage of the gay people in Atlanta now have 15-plus
years of being involved in the community. All that is paying off
now.''

<HEAD>Confusing Week For Wall Streeters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of economic strength are keeping the stock
market in a state of unease and leaving the much-awaited new record
high for the Dow Jones industrial average out of reach.
   The forecast throughout Wall Street in July was that the Federal
Reserve would move more aggressively to ease credit conditions to
head off a possible recession.
   Revised forecasts now point to the likelihood that the Federal
Reserve will not relax its credit policy and that interest rates,
which have fallen substantially, could stabilize.
   July statistics on industrial production, homebuilding and retail
sales released recently suggested a modest revival in economic
activity. Although the upward blips in the data were not
extraordinary they were enough to wipe out the two previous months
of declines, analysts said.
   Views of an economic revival were further substantiated on Friday
with the release of July consumer price inflation. The Labor
Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent, but excluding
the two most volatile components _ food and energy _ the index was
up 0.4 percent.
   The report produced mixed reaction among economists as to whether
the numbers meant inflation is building or receding and helped add
to the market's confusion.
   ``We do not think the inflation picture is worsening,'' said
economist Cynthia Latta of DRI-McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass.,
forecasting company. ``We believe the situation has stabilized and
probably will improve some.''
   But economist James Solloway of Argus Research Corp., said taken
together the latest reports do not suggest an easing of inflationary
pressures.
   ``The inflation number is not all that good. We could well see
the overall inflation rate heading higher,'' he said.
   The market began the week on a cautious note. Sellers weren't
aggressive and buyers refrained from participating, reflecting
investor indecision about which way the market would go.
   Their unease was compounded by the failure of the Dow Jones
industrial average to decisively pierce its all-time high of
2,722.42 reached Aug. 25, 1987, despite flirting with a record
breaking rise earlier this month.
   Less than two months after the 1987 peak, the market tumbled in
the worst panic of history.
   ``In the backs of their minds was the 1987 stock market crash,''
said Richard McCabe, manager of market analysis at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. ``They're not going to get caught in the same scenario as 1987.''
   With the market drifting early in the week but refusing to move
down too dramatically, many participants remained sidelined, unable
to find what they considered bargains.
   Volume was light in contrast to the previous week's activity in
which about 1 billion shares traded hands in the busiest week in
more than a year. Volume on the Big Board averaged 148.84 million
shares a day, down from 200.81 million a day in the previous week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up to 2,687.97, a
gain of 3.98 points on the week. The average had climbed 30.54
points in the previous week.
   The New York stock Exchange composite index advanced 0.37 to
192.64; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
inched .51 lower to 461.97, and the American Stock Exchange Market
value index declined 1.46 to 379.18.
   While improved economic growth would usually be good for stock
prices, analysts said investors remained captives of the bond
market. Interest rates were foremost in the minds of bondholders,
who bid prices down much of the week.
   ``What the data shows is that the Federal Reserve has gone as far
as it's going to go for the time being - the next two to four
weeks,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president, First Albany
Corp. ``There's too much life left in this economy so the Fed won't
lower interest rates.''

<HEAD>How Safe Is A Bond After A Takeover? New Service May Tell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate bonds are supposed to be a relatively
safe investment, but how secure are they if the company that issued
them is hit by a hostile takeover?
   That's the kind of information a credit-rating company hopes to
make available to investors though a new service.
   Last month, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. began ranking the protection
industrial bonds provide in the face of a takeover or corporate
restructuring. These threats, called ``event risks'' in bond
parlance, can cause bond prices to plunge.
   S&amp;P is evaluating the protective language in a bond's indenture,
or the written agreement between a bond issuer and bond holder. It
is the first such ranking by a major credit rating service.
   The danger to bond prices from corporate upheaval was pointed out
graphically earlier this year when RJR Nabisco Inc. was taken over
by the leveraged buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   RJR's bonds, once rated as high-grade investments, plummeted to
the junk-bond category due to the huge amount of debt the food and
tobacco company acquired through the takeover. Their price soon
dropped through the floor.
   S&amp;P's ranking of the ``protective covenants'' contained in bond
indentures judges how well a bond will maintain value in the face of
a sudden and dramatic decline in its rating.
   The rating agency devised a scale of E-1 to E-5, with bonds rated
E-1 providing the most event-risk protection and those rated E-5
providing insignificant or no protection.
   A common type of protection, sometimes called a ``super put,''
requires the issuer to redeem a bond at face value, which is called
a put, or raise the bond's interest rate if a credit-damaging event
occurs.
   S&amp;P cautions that its ratings are not a judgment on the
likelihood that a company is a candidate for a takeover or
restructuring. The event risk rating is separate from S&amp;P's ratings
of corporate creditworthiness.
   So far, S&amp;P has ranked about 25 bonds for their event-risk
protection, said Gail I. Hessol, a managing director at the ratings
agency, which is a division of McGraw-Hill Inc. For bondholders,
what it's found isn't encouraging.
   Of the 25, only one received the top ranking, and the event-risk
protection in many wasn't found to be worth much, S&amp;P said.
   The rating agency was particularly unimpressed with a common
feature of covenants that triggers the protection if at least 30
percent of a company's stock is repurchased by management within a
12-month period.
   S&amp;P says the 30 percent repurchase threshold is too high, giving
the company the latitude to significantly weaken credit quality by
taking on more debt to buy back stock.
   The bond offering that received the top ranking was issued by
Enron Corp., a Houston energy concern. It promises to increase the
interest rate if the issue is downgraded for any reason by S&amp;P or
Moody's Investors Service Inc., the other major credit-rating
company.
   S&amp;P says the reaction to its new service has been extremely
favorable.
   ``My phone did not stop ringing for a month,'' Ms. Hessol said
last week. ``We think there was a hunger for information on this
subject.''
   But not everyone was pleased.
   ``There were a small number of (bond) issuers who felt we were
putting them in play or implying they were takeover targets by
virtue of the fact we were evaluating their bond indentures and
weren't very impressed with the value of the protection,'' she said.
   But ``once issuers understood what we were doing and what we were
not doing, most of them were comfortable.''
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., in a recent commentary on the
S&amp;P rankings, said it was surprised at the agency's low opinion of
the protection provided by the super puts.
   But it welcomed the ratings, saying they ``should provide more
and better information for use by industrial bond investors.''
   Moody's says it has no plans for a similar ranking of event-risk
protection.
   Moody's already includes a judgment of protective language in
credit ratings if it believes the bond issuer is a candidate for a
ratings-damaging event, said Michael Mulvaney, a Moody's senior
analyst.
   In addition, Moody's ratings are adjusted downward if it believes
a company is vulnerable to event risk.
   ``In cases where we find indentures that have significant
protection, we may assign a slightly higher rating,'' Mulvaney said.

<HEAD>Government Wins and Loses In Latest Insider Trading Drama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another chapter in the Ivan Boesky insider
trading epic is history, leaving a new entry on the government's
felons list but a bad taste in many mouths over the heavy-handed
behavior of federal prosecutors.
   Robert Freeman, a leading Wall Street strategist who bet huge
sums of money on speculative takeover stocks for himself and his
venerable employer Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., agreed this past week to
quit and plead guilty to one felony fraud count for insider trading
in Beatrice Cos. shares more than three years ago.
   At the same time, the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which has
orchestrated an aggressive prosecution of Wall Street corruption
stemming from the Boesky scandal, announced without explanation that
it was abandoning a probe of two other prominent traders arrested
with Freeman in February 1987.
   Those arrests, executed with extraordinary publicity by then-U.S.
attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, stunned an industry unaccustomed to
police raids, search warrants and handcuffs.
   It has since become a splotch on the prosecution career of
Giuliani, who is running for New York mayor based partly on his
record of convictions in securities cases and other white collar
frauds.
   A few months after the Freeman trio was indicted, prosecutors
dropped the charges because a judge wouldn't give them more pretrial
preparation time. Giuliani said he would bring new charges soon but
never did, leaving the three no opportunity to exonerate themselves.
   Giuliani and his successor, Benito Romano, have said the
government may have acted prematurely in the Freeman trio arrest and
prosecution, but have offered no apologies.
   The government's behavior in that case reflects what many defense
lawyers have called a display of sloppiness and arrogance that has
needlessly ruined careers and reputations in the government's
anti-fraud crusade.
   Perhaps more important, it suggested the weakness of evidence
against Freeman and co-defendants, Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. trader
Richard B. Wigton and former Kidder trader Timothy L. Tabor.
   The case was based largely on the confessions of Martin A.
Siegel, a former mergers specialist with Kidder who was implicated
in fraud by Boesky, the notorious speculator now serving a federal
prison term for insider trading.
   Defense lawyers have said the case against Freeman boiled down to
his word against Siegel's over whether the pair conspired to use
inside information in the trading of Beatrice stock.
   So it remains unclear why Freeman, after maintaining innocence
and with an apparently strong defense, chose to strike a deal and
plead guilty this past week.
   Freeman said in a resignation statement that he wanted to spare
his family the publicity of a trial and that he already had
subjected them, his employer and himself to an ordeal.
   But some lawyers have suggested he was motivated more by guilty
verdicts in two other cases that also stemmed indirectly from the
Boesky scandal, verdicts that showed the evident willingness of
juries to treat defendants in securities crimes harshly.
   In June, a federal jury found stock speculator Paul Bilzerian
guilty of securities fraud in four failed takeover attempts. Last
month, six securities professionals, including a friend of
Freeman's, were found guilty of fraud and the much more serious
charge of racketeering, which carries enormous penalties.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Government statistics suggested the economy isn't as weak as
previously believed, nor is it growing rapidly enough to accelerate
inflation. The June trade deficit narrowed to a 4{-year low and
consumer prices rose only 0.2 percent in July.
   _The Securities and Exchange Commission tightened its control by
adopting rules aimed at quelling penny-stock scams peddled to
unwitting investors over the telephone. President Bush, meanwhile,
nominated a key adviser on the thrift crisis, Richard Breeden, to
become the new SEC chairman.
   _The oil industry faced a new onslaught of litigation over the
March 24 Exxon Corp. tanker spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
The Alaskan government contended all oil companies operating in
Alaska were negligent in their joint responsibility to prevent
spills.
   _It was a bad week for Eastern airlines strikers but a good one
for air passengers and UAL Corp. shareholders. Eastern showed signs
of strengthening its operations despite the prolonged walkout;
several major airlines extended a round of fare discounting into the
fall; and investor Marvin Davis's efforts to buy UAL for more than
$6 billion drove its stock to record levels.

<HEAD>Rally Brings Speculators Back To Copper Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-week rally in copper futures prices has speculators
anticipating a run at record highs for the third year in a row as
the market shifts into its seasonal period of peak demand.
   Spot prices would have to rise more than 40 cents to surpass the
all-time high of $1.6475 a pound set last December on New York's
Commodity Exchange but this is a market with a proven ability to
outdo itself. The previous record high of $1.46 a pound was set in
December 1987.
   ``The market is looking at all the factors and saying the
possibility is here for something serious to take place,'' said
Craig Sloane, a metal-markets analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Copper for spot delivery on the Comex settled Friday at $1.2465 a
pound compared with $1.1735 a week earlier and $1.13 the week before
that, representing a two-week gain of about 10 percent.
   Prices climbed as high as $1.2680 on Thursday but declined Friday
following news of Cyprus Minerals Co.'s plan to restart a damaged
copper smelter in Arizona within the next two weeks.
   Most other commodity markets showed little change in the past
week.
   Copper's rise is rooted in persistent supply tightness caused by
labor strife at mines in Canada and Peru _ two of the largest
producer nations _ and by equipment failures, sabotage and
transportation problems in some of the South American and African
countries that contribute heavily to the world supply.
   Prices fell sharply earlier this year and had been trading in a
range between $1.05 and $1.15 since mid-May. The current steep
ascent began on Aug. 9, the first of seven straight days of rising
prices, when it appeared Peruvian miners were ready to strike. The
strike began on Monday and has not been settled.
   Another supportive factor is the expectation of increased demand,
which typically occurs in the fall and winter as makers of copper
wire and machine parts replenish their supplies.
   Finally, copper prices are responding to recent economic data
indicating the economy is stronger than many experts had expected.
The stronger the economy, the stronger the demand for copper as a
component of new offices and homes.

   A man you've never met, touting a company
you've never heard of tries to sell you a stock you never wanted.
   Sometimes it's an honest broker pushing a low-priced but
high-risk legitimate stock, but often the call is from a
``boiler-room'' bank of telephones staffed by smooth-talking sales
people preying on the anxieties or greed of unsophisticated buyers.
   ``A high pressure salesman might say if you don't buy now, you're
going to miss the boat,'' says Robert Ferri of the National
Association of Securities Dealers. ``The only boat you're going to
miss is the Titanic.''
   The NASD oversees over-the-counter stocks and the brokers who
deal in them.
   A rising tide of fraud involving penny stocks _ inexpensive but
risky securities that usually aren't traded on any stock exchanges _
has worried securities regulators and industry officials across the
country.
   Penny stocks in themselves aren't illegal. But the North American
Securities Administrators Association, a Washington-based
organization of state investment regulators, calls the fraudulent
sale of these securities the biggest threat facing the average
investor.
   Three weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in
Chicago with an alleged $10 million penny stock scam in which the
companies' share prices were artificially raised before being sold
at large profits.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil
complaint that the companies were only shams created to peddle
stock. One company's stock, first offered at 15 cents per share in
1985, rose to a high of $6 per share through announcements of bogus
mergers and other scams that drew in millions of dollars from
investors around the country.
   In Florida earlier this year, state authorities moved to revoke
the license of a Denver-based penny stock brokerage, which allegedly
bilked thousands of investors including an 80-year-old woman who
lost about $30,000.
   Penny stock fraud is ``the fraud du jour,'' says Lawrence H.
Fuchs, Florida's deputy comptroller.
   ``Nationally the problem has become epidemic,'' said John B.
Hiatt, director of the New Mexico Securities Division.
   While his state doesn't have a lot of wealthy investors, ``a
disproportionate number of customer complaints about broker dealers
in our state derive from the penny stock market,'' he said.
   ``I would say it's rapidly coming to the forefront of our
activities,'' said Irwin Fisk, chief investigator for the California
Division of Corporations in Southern California.
   In the 23 years he's been on the job Fisk said his division had
seen about six penny stock fraud cases. ``We've got that many or
more pending right now, most in the last few months.''
   Officials say the very nature of penny stocks makes them prone to
scam artists.
   Trading for a few cents up to a few dollars, penny stocks usually
are issued by new companies ranging from energy developers to makers
of would-be wonderdrugs. They often have an untested or unevent
earnings history.
   Because most penny stocks are not listed nationally, information
about them is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult to
dispute.
   ``Information is power and you don't have it with penny stocks,''
said Ferri, the NASD spokesman.
   He said unscupulous brokers offering stocks in unsolicited
telephone calls known as ``cold calling'' might be pushing
legitimate stocks but not for the price at which they are actually
trading. The stocks aren't usually carried in newspaper stock
listings and buyers have no way of knowing their real price.
   Another scam consists of constantly selling stock, buying it back
and selling it again at increasingly higher prices, like a pyramid
scheme, until the last buyers are left holding stocks that are only
worth a fraction of the price they paid.
   The SEC has created a penny stock task force and recently
approved rules that will make it impossible for unscrupulous brokers
to conduct penny stock sales with new customers over the phone.
   The new rule, effective Jan. 1, requires buyers to approve the
first three transactions with a new broker in writing and requires
the broker to determine the buyer's financial status and the
suitability of the stock purchase.
   Sarah B. Ackerson, an SEC attorney assigned to the task force,
said the agency still is compiling nationwide statistics about penny
stock fraud.
   But she noted that in the first half of the fiscal year that will
end Sept. 30, the SEC received 2,462 complaints about penny stock
fraud compared with 1,510 for all of last year.
   Regulators and industry officials caution investors to be wary
when considering penny stocks, especially when offered through
solicited phone calls.
   ``Hang up on them,'' advises Florida's Fuchs. ``Investigate a
company thoroughly before you commit money.''
   ``I would ask for a prospectus before I bought anything,'' said
California's Fisk.
   ``Consumers have to do their homework,'' said NASD's Ferri, who
advised checking up on whether the broker is reputable.
   ``The front line in this war is the consumer and too often people
get victimized because they don't let common sense rule the moment.''

   William Herbert Hunt, one of two former billionaire
sons of wildcat oilman H.L. Hunt who is under protection from
creditors, has filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court that
would pay less than half of the $300 million in back taxes the
government claims he owes.
   Meanwhile a Peruvian mining company filed a plan with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Dallas saying it would settle for $90 million of
the $132 million it lost on Hunt's failed silver speculation.
   The filings were on Thursday.
   The Internal Revenue Service, Hunt's largest creditor, previously
has said it would settle for about $150 million, but Hunt's most
recent plan would pay the IRS $120 million _ half from the proceeds
of a liquidating trust and half from earnings after he emerges from
bankruptcy.
   All competing plans in the bankruptcy case envision selling off
Hunt's assets, estimated at between $80 million and $125 million.
The differences come in how the pie is split.
   Hunt's plan would give unsecured creditors 37 percent, or roughly
$30 million, of the liquidating trust.
   ``This plan gives the unsecured creditors the biggest pot,'' Hunt
attorney Stephen McCartin told The Dallas Morning News. ``The only
issue is whether the IRS will agree to the plan.''
   Minpeco SA, which won a $132 million judgment against Hunt and
two of his brothers because of their silver dealings, filed its own
plan Thursday, saying it would settle for $75 million to be paid
over six years, plus an additional $15 million from Hunt's share of
the proceeds from the trust.
   Minpeco also would pay Hunt a 3 percent management fee for acting
as an adviser in the liquidation of his assets.
   The filing is the latest result of a split in what had once been
an informal creditors committee of Minpeco, the IRS and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The IRS and Manufacturers Hanover, however, dispute Minpeco's
preferential claim on the assets of Herbert or Nelson Bunker Hunt,
who also has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   Because Minpeco already has been paid about $80 million by other
silver defendants, the IRS and the bank claim the other damages
Minpeco is owed are largely punitive damages, interest and attorneys
fees and are subordinate to the claims of unsecured creditors.
   Bunker Hunt, meanwhile, has until Aug. 31 to file a
reorganization plan acceptable to creditors. After than, the
creditors may be allowed to file their own plan.
   The Hunts filed for personal bankruptcy last year after Minpeco
won a lawsuit claiming it had lost money because of the brothers'
attempt to corner the silver market.
   At the time of the filing, Herbert and his wife, Nancy, said they
had assets of about $196.38 million and debts of $887 million,
including the $300 million IRS claim.
   Bunker and his wife, Caroline, said they had assets of $258.83
million to cover $1.2 billion in debts, including $600 million to
the IRS.
