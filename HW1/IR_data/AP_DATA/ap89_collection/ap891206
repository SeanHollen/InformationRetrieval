<HEAD>A Nightmare Come True _ Massacre in a College Classroom</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Canada-Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a nightmare come true Wednesday afternoon
_ a crowded classroom at the University of Montreal engineering
building and a rifleman in hunting clothes picking out his victims
before firing.
   By the time the gunman killed himself, he had shot 14 women to
death and wounded 12 others. Six women were shot to death in the
first classroom he entered and a seventh in another room. Then the
man prowled the halls, killing three women in the cafeteria and
four more women in the corridor of the third floor, where he then
shot himself.
   Witnesses described the scene in the first classroom, at the
beginning of the massacre:
   ``I was doing a presentation in front of the class and suddenly
a guy came in with what I think was a semi-automatic rifle,''
engineering student Eric Chavarie said.
   ``He told us to stop everything.
   ``And then when we looked at him we thought it was a joke, but
he fired a shot in the air and separated us into two groups, the
guys in one corner and the girls in (another) corner.
   ``When that was done, he asked the guys to leave. He left the
girls in there.
   ``We got outside in the hallway and for a couple of minutes he
stayed in there and after, when we got out, he leveled his gun at a
group of people who were there and he shot three or four shots.''
   Pierre Robert, 25, a student in the classroom, said, ``He told
the guys to move to one side and the girls to the other. Nobody
moved. We thought it was a joke. It was our last hour of the term.
We practically laughed.
   ``I thought it was a blank,'' said Robert, who was close to a
classropm wall at which the gunman fired. ``I didn't see anything
on the wall. But it made a very loud noise.
   ``When he came in he was really calm but after the first shot
his voice became nervous.''
   Professor Yvon Bouchard, who taught the mechanical engineering
course, was sitting at his desk listening to the student
presentation when the gunman entered.
   ``I didn't see him walk in. When I saw him, he was two or three
feet from the students presenting their project,'' Bouchard said.
   ``Then he asked all the men to go one one side of the room and
the women on the other.
   ``Nobody moved. We thought it was a joke.
   ``It doesn't make sense.''
   Student Luc Gauthier, 24, left the classroom about 5 p.m.
   The gunman entered, carrying an object that looked like a rifle
in a trash bag.
   ``I went to the bathroom and when I came back, people were
running out, screaming, `There's a crazy guy in there! He's shot
people!,' Gauthier said.
   ``I went to get my things and saw there was blood in front of
the photocopy machine.
   ``Someone told me the first person he shot when he came out of
the classroom was a girl in front of the photocopy machine.''
   Francois Bordeleau, a student who ran from the first to the
second floor, said he dragged people by the collar to keep them
from going downstairs to see the gunman.
   Student Vanthona Ouy, 22, tore the sleeve on his coat as he fled
the building.
   ``I saw death up close and I shook. I dropped everything and
ran,'' he said.
   Student Serge Bacon said: ``I was in the stairwell and someone
came up the stairs shouting, `Watch out! Watch out! He's coming!' I
thought he was joking.''
   Yannick Lacoste, a student who had just left the school library
when she heard about five consecutive gunshots in the hallways,
said, ``People were yelling, `Someone is firing!' and students were
running through the halls.
   ``I hurried to the door. I was very nervous. You don't know if
the shots are aimed at you.''

<TEXT>
   A truck bomb containing a half-ton of
dynamite exploded outside secret police headquarters during the
morning rush hour Wednesday, killing at least 35 people and
wounding hundreds.
   The bomb, presumably the work of drug gangs, was the most
powerful to strike the capital since Colombia's cocaine traffickers
began a wave of terror after the government declared war on them 16
weeks ago. President Virgilio Barco told Colombians they face an
escalation in drug-related violence.
   Late Wednesday, three bombs exploded in Medellin, the hub of a
major cocaine-trafficking cartel, a police spokesman told The
Associated Press by telephone from the city. He said they went off
at an electronics shop, a Morman temple and an evangelical church
without injuring anyone.
   Police also deactivated a car bomb a block from the offices of
dozens of judges in Bogota on Wednesday afternoon, the national
police said.
   Barco said late Wednesday in a nationally televised speech that
drug traffickers had begun a new wave of terrorism intended to stop
extradition of suspects to the United States and to destroy
Colombian democracy.
   ``We must not, we will not ever fall before the drug
traffickers,'' Barco said in the speech broadcast by radio and
television from Tokyo, where he was on a state visit. ``The stable
democracy that we have built with great effort and defended for
more than a century is in danger.''
   The Bogota blast, which tore open a crater 20 feet deep and
destroyed or heavily damaged a score of buildings, occurred less
than 24 hours after government investigators said a bomb caused the
crash of a Colombian jetliner last month that killed 107 people.
   No one claimed responsibility directly for Wednesday's
explosion, but Gen. Faruk Yanine, Bogota police chief, said it was
undoubtedly the work of drug traffickers.
   A statement from the so-called Extraditables delivered to
newspapers and radio stations in Medellin, said: ``We will stop the
war only when the Senate understands the people must be our judge.''
   The reference was to a bill that would permit a national
referendum on extraditing drug trafficking suspects wanted in the
United States. The House of Representatives approved it Tuesday
night.
   Barco's government opposes the measure, contending the drug
barons would step up terrorism before a referendum to frighten
voters into rejecting extradition.
   In his comments, Barco blamed traffickers for the bombing of the
jetliner last month, for Tuesday's assassination of a judge in
Medellin, and for the bombing of the secret police headquarters. He
said the three attacks represent ``a vile assault'' by the
traffickers.
   ``These incidents show that what these criminals are capable of
as they make sure that the referendum results are in their favor,''
Barco said, who was scheduled to return from Japan on Friday.
   In their statement, the Extraditables said: ``The president
should not fear what the congress decides, because the congress is
the voice of the people, and the voice of the people is the voice
of God.''
   Minister of Government Carlos Lemos Simmonds told reporters
after the bombing: ``The slaughter that we warned of when the House
approved extradition in the plebiscite has started.'' He is acting
president while Barco is on the state visit.
   The Bogota bomb went off at 7:30 a.m. in an area crowded with
people bound for work on foot and in cars.
   So powerful was the explosion that it broke windows in a
building across the street from the U.S. Embassy seven miles away.
Caracol quoted sources with explosives experts at the scene as
saying the truck was packed with 1,100 pounds of dynamite.
   Reports on the number of dead and wounded varied, and rescuers
were pulling bodies from the rubble of buildings hours after the
blast.
   Health Minister Eduardo Diaz said in an interview with Caracol
that at least 35 people were killed, 250 seriously wounded and 750
treated for cuts, abrasions, shock and shock. Unconfirmed reports
gave higher death tolls.
   However, the television news program ``24 Hours'' reported the
death toll rose to 40 late Wednesday. Police said they were unable
to confirm that report.
   The explosion blew the facade off the secret police headquarters
and destroyed virtually all its walls and windows. Also heavily
damaged were an office building for federal judges across the
street and the national transit police headquarters a block away.
   Half a dozen stores across the street from secret police
headquarters were reduced to smoking rubble and about 60 cars were
destroyed.
   Visa renewal is one function of the secret police, or Department
of Administrative Security. Many foreigners usually are there on
any given weekday, but it was not known whether foreigners were
among the dead and wounded.
   This is a busy season because many foreigners go home for
Christmas, and cannot do so without reports of clean police records.
   Minutes after the explosion, detectives at secret police
headquarters scrambled up ladders and, from the remains of cells,
pulled two stunned prisoners awaiting extradition to the United
States. The prisoners were taken away in an armored vehicle.
   Lemos said on Caracol the bombing illustrated the futility of
trying to negotiate with the drug gangs. He said the government
would not lessen its resolve to crush them.
   In their statement about the second bomb in Bogota, the national
police said the device was hidden in a subcompact Renault parked in
front of a government building where dozens of judges have their
offices. The police did not say how much dynamite was in the car.
   Barco began the war on traffickers hours after they assassinated
a leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, on Aug.
16 during a campaign speech in Bogota.
   He also reinstated extradition of suspects to the United States,
which was suspended by Supreme Court rulings in 1987 and 1988. Nine
have been sent to the United States the past three months.
   An Avianca Airlines passenger jet exploded in the air Nov. 27
and all 107 people aboard were killed. The government Tuesday said
a bomb caused the explosion.
   Not counting the plane crash victims or the victims of
Wednesday's truck bomb, 29 people have been killed and 238 wounded
by 201 bombs since Galan's assassination.

<HEAD>Officials Say Military Growth To Continue Despite Global Peace Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's defense budget, already judged the third
largest in the world, will continue to grow even as the superpowers
talk about cutting back on military spending, officials say.
   In a region so far immune to dramatic improvements in relations
like those occurring in Europe, Japan has at best cool relations
with the Soviet Union as the two countries are deadlocked over an
old territorial dispute. And the United States is pressing Tokyo to
increase its budgetary support for U.S. forces based in Japan.
   Japan's military budget, always controversial in light of a
constitution that bans war, has grown steadily through the 1980s to
increase the country's ability to fend off Soviet attack.
   ``It is separate from (superpower) arms reductions from that
point of view. So our own efforts for improving our self-defense
are not expected to change at the moment,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe told a news conference Tuesday.
   He was asked if the outcome of the superpower summit in Malta,
which gave new impetus to arms negotiations between the United
States and Soviet Union, would reduce Japan's military spending.
The United States is starting to plan for defense cuts, and U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says the Soviets have reduced
military spending.
   Japanese newspapers reported today that Seiki Nishihiro, vice
minister of the Defense Agency, had cautioned the public against
thinking that the superpower summit could result in a cutback in
this country's defense budget.
   And an anonymous Foreign Ministry official was quoted in the
Yomiuri Shimbun daily as saying, ``The Asian situation is
completely different from that of Europe, and still remains
unstable. Japan needs to develop a minimum defense strength for
deterrence.''
   Last week, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that the defense
budget would grow a hefty 6 percent in the fiscal year that begins
in April, to about $27.8 billion, or roughly 1 percent of gross
national product.
   The U.S. defense budget is more than 10 times as large and
consumes 6 percent of gross national product.
   Japan's defense spending has grown rapidly in dollar terms due
to the yen's almost doubling in value since 1985, and now is judged
third-biggest in the world or slightly ahead of Britain, France and
West Germany.
   Much of the defense buildup took place in close coordination
with the United States, which by treaty is obliged to help defend
Japan. The two countries' navies and air forces collaborate on
defense planning, and the Japanese have been building up potent air
and anti-submarine forces.
   Unlike Central Europe, with its fairly clear divide between two
superpower camps on the ground, the Far East is a vast area in
which control of the sea is a more important factor, and there are
more contenders: the Soviets, China, the U.S.-Japan alliance, and
powerful smaller countries like Vietnam and the Koreas.
   The Asian countries, however, have bitter memories of Japanese
invasions, and have protested Tokyo's increases in military
spending.
   After World War II, U.S. occupation authorities imposed a
constutition that bans the use of military force, and the armed
forces have an ambiguous status. Their existence is justified as
strictly for self-defense, and Japan has not acquired hardware that
would enable distant military adventures, such as long-range
bombers or aircraft carriers.
   But some Americans have called for Japan to increase defense
efforts even more to relieve the U.S. military outlay.
   President Bush recently signed a bill calling on Japan to pay
all the costs of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan.
Japan now pays about 45 percent of the support, or about $2.8
billion a year.
   The Japanese government has not yet commented on the new call
from Washington.

<HEAD>Literature Laureate Says He'll Be Happy When It's Over</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela, in
town to collect his Nobel Prize for literature, says he'll be glad
when all the fuss is over and he can start working again.
   ``Since the announcement of the prize I haven't led any life at
all. I've just been answering questions all the time,'' he told a
news conference Tuesday.
   Cela, 73, has published 70 novels, travelogues, essays and books
of poetry. His 1942 book ``The Family of Pascual Duarte'' was the
most popular work of Spanish fiction since Cervantes' Don Quixote.
   Though claiming to be disturbed by the unceasing attention since
the prize was announced Oct. 18, Cela said he was coming to receive
the Nobel ``with gratitude and emotion.''
   ``But I'm looking forward to being able to sit at my desk and
start working again,'' he said.
   Cela will be given his award by Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf on
Sunday, and a check for the equivalent of $469,000.
   The writer dismissed the idea he would now ``rest on his
laurels'' after receiving one of the world's most coveted literary
awards. ``I can't imagine a retrospective future,'' he said.
   Asked who inspired him the most, Cela said, ``I was inspired by
all Spanish authors before me. Literature is part of a culture.''
   He said he best enjoyed reading medieval Spanish poets. He also
mentioned the late Ernest Hemingway as an influence.
   ``Hemingway was my friend. We went to a lot of bullfights
together. He was a great author and a great friend,'' Cela said.
   Cela drew on his experiences in the Spanish Civil War for many
of his stories, which often showed the violent and gruesome side of
life.

<HEAD>Up To Four Million of Ethiopians Said To Face Possible Starvation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crop failure in civil war-plagued Ethiopia
threatens up to four million people with a famine worse than the
mass starvation of five years ago, the 24-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development says.
   ``The situation in the coming months risks being more serious
than in 1984-85,'' when 1 million Ethiopians starved to death, said
Joe Wheeler, president of the Paris-based organization's Committee
for Aid and Development.
   Food shortages stemming from crop failure are aggravated by
difficulties in distributing emergency aid across combat zones in
northern Ethiopia, Wheeler said Tuesday after the committee's
annual meeting on world development aid.
   The committee called on the world community to help get aid
through to hard-to-reach regions.
   Wheeler said several regions controlled by forces opposed to
Ethiopia's government are no longer producing enough food to feed
their populations.
   The Marxist government must overcome its traditional reluctance
to open up contact to rebel-held areas if the civilian population
is to have any chance of surviving 1990, Wheeler said.
   ``It's often possible to persuade governments to permit certain
actions for humanitarian reasons,'' he said. ``It's essential to
get food across the lines.'' Wheeler said similar problems had been
overcome in neighboring Sudan.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's
members include all NATO nations, Japan, and neutral countries such
as Austria, Finland and Switzerland.

<HEAD>NEA, Urban Schools Seek Input Into National Education Goals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the nation's governors try to meet a
self-imposed deadline for developing national education goals,
leaders of education groups are moving to have some impact on the
finished product.
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
proposed Tuesday that federally financed preschool programs for
poor youngsters integrate nutrition, prenatal care and health
screening.
   Early childhood education should be the primary focus of the
nation, Geiger said in an interview two days before Thursday's
meeting of the Education Task Force of the National Governors'
Association,
   And while preschool was included in its recommendations, a
second education group, the Council of the Great City Schools, said
the first priority should be to improve urban schools.
   The council said 30.4 percent of all poor children in the United
States are enrolled in only 50 urban school systems and the teacher
shortage in urban schools is 2{ times greater than the national
average.
   Geiger and council leaders _ President Larry Zenke and Director
Samuel Husk _ will present their ideas on national performance
goals for education at the task force meeting. The governors' group
has been working since the idea was approved in September at the
education summit between governors and President Bush.
   All 50 governors will convene in late February to put on the
finishing touches.
   In a Dec. 1 letter to the task force co-chairmen, Geiger
suggested the goals ``be both ambitious and specific: ambitious
enough to demonstrate that America's leaders understand the depth
of the problems schools face, specific enough to enable Americans
to hold government accountable.''
   Husk said the council's board of directors decided in early
November to strongly recommend that national goals contain specific
targets, outcomes and measures from each area; interim goals to be
met along the way; program and funding strategies at all levels and
plans for incentives and accountability.
   The Council of the Great City Schools is an organization of 45
urban school districts that concentrates on the concerns of city
schools.
   ``Urban educators have proven their ability to improve our
schools with limited resources, however, the time has come for
governments, businesses and our communities to provide the monetary
resources to support efforts to fulfill our commitment to quality
education for all children,'' Husk said.
   ``No child should be allowed to fall through the cracks,''
Geiger said. ``Every child should arrive at school physically,
intellectually, emotionally and socially able to learn.''
   Head Start has been touted as the most successful preschool
program financed by the federal government. About 1,300 Head Start
programs operate around the country, providing education and health
and nutrition services to about 20 percent of the impoverished
preschoolers who are eligible.
   Bush recently signed a law to increase spending for the Head
Start program this fiscal year by $147 million to $1.6 billion.
   But the NEA estimated about $6.3 billion is needed to serve all
eligible children ages 3 through 5.
   Both the NEA and council offered similar proposals they want
incorporated into the national performance goals. For example, both
called for safe, disciplined and drug-free schools. The council
also suggested there should be specific steps to be taken by
distillers, tobacco and firearms manufacturers to reduce youth
access to their products.
   The groups also called for a reduction in the dropout rate.
   The NEA proposed providing a fully qualified teacher for every
classroom, with salaries and benefits competitive with other fields
that require comparable skills, preparation and responsibility.
   The council suggested the goals target specific number or
percentages of teachers needed by 2000 to better reflect the racial
characteristics of students.

   Detectives are trying to track down the
joker who stole 1,980 ``Batman'' bicycles.
   The bandits took the bikes, worth $90,000, from the Schaefer
Brothers Distribution trucking company last weekend, said Detective
Larry Thompson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
   ``The only thing we know for sure is they cut the locks off the
chain-link gates and went in there with some tractors and stole the
bikes,'' Thompson said Tuesday. ``We have very little to work with
right now.''
   Investigators believe the thieves first stole two big-rig

<HEAD>Analysts: Farmers Will Be in the Market for New Machinery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A relatively high level of cash income is
expected to put more farmers in the 1990 market for new machinery
and other capital improvements, Agriculture Department analysts say.
   Net cash income is expected to be in the range of $52 billion to
$54 billion this year, down from a record $59.9 billion in 1988
because of higher production expenses and lower government payments.
   In 1990, according to projections announced at the department's
recent outlook conference, net cash income _ the difference between
cash gross income and cash expenses _ may be in the range of $52
billion to $57 billion.
   Stan G. Daberkow of the department's Economic Research Service
said that with 1990 net cash income looking brighter and interest
rates to remain near current levels, capital spending next year
could rise 4 percent to 5 percent.
   ``Prospects for increased planted acreage and an aging farm
machinery stock may also positively influence capital spending by
farmers,'' he said.
   A seven-year slump for the farm machinery industry ended in 1986.
   ``Unit sales of new farm tractors and other large pieces of farm
equipment increased in 1987 and 1988 and are likely to show further
gains in 1989 and 1990,'' Daberkow said. ``Sales of new
over-40-horsepower tractors may reach 64,000 units, up from an
estimated 62,000 in 1989.''
   Daberkow said combines did not substantially rebound until this
year because some farmers had to postpone capital spending because
of the 1988 drought. Even so, self-propelled combine sales, which
are closely related to harvest prospects, ``began to rise
significantly'' from 1988 levels by April of this year.
   The retooling of U.S. agriculture is long overdue. Between 1980
and 1986, he said, capital expenditures dropped by nearly 60
percent.
   ``Rising real interest rates, declining commodity prices,
curtailed agricultural exports, reluctance to take on additional
debt, falling land values, reduced planted cropland and a binge of
capital spending in the 1970s led to very conservative levels of
capital spending in the 1980s,'' Daberkow said.
   Tractors and other farm machinery usually make up about 60
percent of all capital expenditures, with buildings and land
improvements accounting for 25 percent to 30 percent, and cars and
trucks the remainder.
   Sales of large new tractors were one of the hardest hit
categories during the early and mid-1980s, with the number of units
sold plummeting 75 percent.
   Daberkow said farmers may spend between $118 billion and $121
billion next year on total agricultural supplies, or inputs, which
would be down 1 percent to 2 percent from this year. That would be
due in part to lower feed costs.

   The Agriculture Department says China has been
authorized to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat
at subsidized prices.
   Acting Undersecretary John B. Campbell said Tuesday that the
wheat will be available to China under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and
is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have averaged from around $10 per ton, to more
than $40 per ton of wheat, or in the range of 27 cents to about
$1.10 per bushel.
   Campbell said 10,000 tons remained in the previous EEP
allocation for China announced Feb. 27. That allocation was for 2
million tons.
   China was the largest foreign buyer of U.S. wheat in the 1988-89
wheat marketing year that ended May 31 with orders for nearly 8.1
million tons, all of it under the EEP program. Sales for 1989-90
total about 4.7 million tons, most of it without subsidies.
   China is also the world's largest wheat producer this year with
an output estimated at 91 million tons. That compares with the
Soviet Union's harvest of 89 million tons this year and the U.S.
production of about 56 million tons.

   Imports of lambs and sheep rose sharply this
year and are expected to continue rising in 1990, according to
Agriculture Department livestock analysts.
   Imports during the first eight months of 1989 totaled 106,676
head, up from only 24,775 in the same period last year, the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   Traditionally, Canada supplies most of the lamb imports, but
this year large shipments have been received from New Zealand for
U.S. feedlots.
   ``With the investment in the facilities and the initial outlook
for lamb prices to be marginally above present levels, lambs should
continue to be imported next year,'' the agency said in an outlook
report.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Scandal Hits Donations to Voter Registration Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two liberal voter registration groups that
took money from Charles J. Keating, a central figure in the savings
and loan scandal, have seen contributions dry up, officials of the
organizations say.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., one of five senators under
investigation by the Senate ethics committee, played a role in
soliciting money from Keating for both groups, said Murray Flander,
his spokesman.
   One group, The Forum Institute, will suspend operations Jan. 1
because the links to Keating have prompted so much turmoil, William
Jeffress, the group's lawyer, said Tuesday.
   ``Given all the proceedings, given the involvement of Cranston,
and Keating, the board thinks it's best they suspend operations on
Jan. 1,'' Jeffress said.
   The other group, the Center for Participation in Democracy,
based in Los Angeles, is not ``actively soliciting resources,''
according to Cruz Reynoso, chairman of the board. The center's
future will be discussed at the next board meeting, Reynoso said.
   Reynoso, a former California Supreme Court justice and also a
member of the Forum Institute's board, said the bad publicity
surrounding Keating has ``made it very difficult to raise money.''
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported today that federal law
enforcement authorities are investigating whether both groups
violated their tax-exempt status by instructing employees to
register more Democrats than Republicans.
   Cranston denied that in an interview with the Times, saying
voter registration drives were ``carefully done in accordance with
legal requirements.''
   Keating, a Phoenix millionaire who headed the American
Continental Corp. and its subsidiary, the Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, contributed $325,000 over two years to the institute,
Jeffress said.
   Keating also gave $400,000 to the center, a group set up by
Cranston's son, Kim, with his father's help, to register new voters
in Western states.
   The Lincoln failure, the subject of numerous federal and state
investigations, is expected to cost taxpayers $2.5 billion, the
largest single thrift collapse.
   The Forum Institute was created in 1981 by Robert Stein, a
philanthropist and paid consultant to the Democratic Party until
October. Cranston and Stein frequently worked in tandem to raise
money for voter registration, an issue in which both men were
interested, Flander said.
   Flander said Cranston, who has a personal passion for
registering new voters, traveled around the country raising money
for his cause, including money from Keating.
   ``As far as Alan is concerned, this is a good cause,'' Flander
said, adding that Cranston first met Keating either in 1985 or 1986.
   Cranston sought money from Keating for the Forum Institute, the
Center for Participation in Democracy and USA Votes, a project of
Stein's company, New Dimension Resources Inc., Flander said.
   New Dimension paid for more than a dozen trips for Cranston to
travel around the country raising money for voter registration
drives in 1988, according to Cranston's financial disclosure forms.
   Stein refused in two telephone conversations to answer any
questions about his involvement with Cranston or Keating. He said
he wanted the controversy to subside before he talked about his
projects.
   The non-profit, tax-exempt Forum Institute is an organization
that ``gives grants to groups that encourage voter participation
and public education,'' according to records filed by with the
Internal Revenue Service.
   The Forum Institute raised $2.1 million in 1988, about $300,000
more than the previous year, the group's IRS records show. Among
the grants the institute handed out were a total of roughly
$305,000 in 1987 and 1988 to the Center for Participation in
Democracy.
   The Forum Institute also gave about $800,000 to the Organizing
Institute of Pacific Grove, Calif., a group that trained registrars
for the center.
   Other forum grants went for a variety of projects, ranging from
clear air to youth activities.
   Cranston, along with Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., Donald
Riegle, D-Mich., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz., are
under investigation by the Senate ethics committee for accepting
campaign contributions from Keating while at the same time
intervening with federal regulators seeking to curb Lincoln's
lending practices. The senators have denied they did anything
illegal.

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush Plugs Salvation Army Bell Ringers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush, giving a plug for the Salvation
Army as several local shopping malls shut it out this holiday
season, said all shopping centers should welcome the annual bell
ringers.
   ``It just wouldn't be Christmas without that bell ringing,'' the
first lady said Tuesday as she dropped $10 into the Salvation Army
kettle inside the entrance to the upscale Mazza Gallerie mall.
   She decided to lend her support when she read a newspaper story
about a large number of local shopping malls that are excluding the
annual solicitation on the grounds that they bar all groups from
soliciting.
   ``I am a great fan of the Salvation Army, so I wanted to come
out and tell you what great work I think you do,'' Mrs. Bush told
Salvation Army volunteer Evelyn Barnes and Col. Jack Waters,
commander of the regional Salvation Army division.
   Waters said about a third of the shopping malls in the
Washington metropolitan area bar the annual holiday solicitation by
the bell ringers _ about double the rate of refusals in other parts
of the country.
   He said more than 125,000 people came to the local Salvation
Army for assistance last year, and this year already has seen more
requests.
   Mrs. Bush said all shopping malls should allow the Salvation
Army to set up its kettles during the Christmas season. Asked what
message she would give to those who refuse, she said she had none
but wanted only to praise the ones that do cooperate.
   ``I'm saying this mall is a great mall,'' she told reporters.
   ``I can't possibly think of Christmas without the Salvation
Army. I can't think of disasters without the Salvation Army,'' she
said referring to the organization's work for victims of natural
disasters. ``I can't think of the needy without the Salvation
Army.''
   The organization said that last year it raised $600,000 in its
kettles throughout the capital region, and about $100,00 of that
will be lost due to malls that are barring the kettles this year.
   After stopping at the Salvation Army kettle, Mrs. Bush did some
Christmas shopping in Neiman-Marcus department store.
   She bought toys and clothes for her grandchildren, said her
press secretary, Anna Perez.

<HEAD>Soviet Support for Najibullah Blocked Political Headway at Malta
Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union will continue supporting the
pro-Moscow leader of Afghanistan despite President Bush's
insistence at the Malta summit that President Najibullah's ouster
would hasten settlement of the war in that country, according to
U.S. officials.
   Bush described Najibullah as ``unacceptable'' to U.S.-backed
Moslem guerrillas, but Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
he was a national figure who was gaining popularity in the country,
the officials said Tuesday.
   Bush and Gorbachev were unable to break new ground at their
superpower summit to end the conflict between government and Moslem
forces in Afghanistan even though the last Soviet troops departed
in February.
   The dispute, which surfaced in an exchange between Bush and
Gorbachev on the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky on Sunday, stood in
sharp contrast to the mostly positive results of the shipboard
meeting.
   A parallel disagreement over Central America was disclosed by
Bush and Gorbachev at a windup news conference Sunday.
   ``I can't say there are no differences between us,'' Bush told
reporters without making any direct reference to the war in
Afghanistan.
   He stressed their differences over Soviet arms supplies to
leftist rebels in El Salvador. Bush insists anti-aircraft missiles
and other weapons were being delivered by Cuba and Nicaragua, but
Gorbachev said he did not know how the arms got to the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front that is at war with the Salvadoran
government, U.S. officials told The Associated Press at the summit
meeting.
   Regional conflicts have proved to be the most resistant to
U.S.-Soviet reconciliation. By contrast, Bush and Gorbachev set as
targets arms control accords to limit nuclear, conventional and
chemical weapons.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, the head of the U.S.-backed Afghan
resistance, met with Bush at the White House before the Malta
summit and said he wanted high-altitude anti-aircraft weapons to
use against Soviet bombers.
   He also expressed hope that Bush would tell Gorbachev to drop
Soviet support for the ``puppet regime and the communist
government'' in the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   ``Unfortunately, the free world thinks that the Russians have
withdrawn completely from Afghanistan,'' Mojaddedi said. ``Still,
the Russians are bombing our people, the mujahedeen, from their own
territory.''
   The Soviet Red Army rolled into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
back a Marxist government against Moslem guerrillas in a war that
had broken out a year earlier.
   The last of the Soviet troops were withdrawn in February, but
U.S. intelligence sources claim Moscow has increased U.S. aid to
Najibullah's government to $300 million to $400 million a month.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, at his meeting in Jackson
Hole, Wyo., in September with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, complained about the arms shipments.
   The Soviets responded that the United States, by sending the
guerrillas a reported $500 million in arms annually via Pakistan,
was violating the Geneva accords signed last year that secured the
Red Army withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   U.S. humanitarian aid to the rebels and refugees in Afghanistan
and Pakistan amounts to $130 million a year. U.S. officials decline
to acknowledge on the record that any American arms are being sent
to the insurgents.
   At the summit, Bush told Gorbachev the Marxist president must
relinquish power before there could be a political settlement of
the war. The president told Gorbachev that Najibullah ``has to
go,'' said the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In another troubled area, the Middle East, the summit talks
produced no apparent discord.
   U.S. officials said Gorbachev appealed for a warmer American
stance toward Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, and said he had ``gone out on a limb'' to
seek peace with Israel.
   Bush urged Gorbachev to understand Israel's concerns over the
PLO. Although the two leaders reached no agreement, Bush concluded
the Soviets were making a ``positive contribution'' to efforts to
resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute and the war in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   National and state officials of both major
political parties deny a study group's charge that they pumped
money exempt from federal regulation into last year's presidential
campaign.
   In a report issued Tuesday, the Center for Responsive Politics
said Republican and Democratic parties in nine battleground states
received $28.5 million in so-called ``soft money'' donations not
covered by federal limits.
   Included in the total were contributions of more than $7.5
million from the Democratic National Committee and more than $2
million from the Republican National Committee.
   ``Anyone can see there was wholesale erosion of our campaign
finance laws during last year's presidential campaign,'' said Ellen
Miller, executive director of the center, a bipartisan group that
studies campaign finance.
   But the parties say the center is taking a one-sided view of
campaign spending.
   Leslie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Republican National
Committee, said the report ``really ignores the fact that ... we
operate on two levels, under federal laws and under state laws.''
   Ginny Terzano, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said: ``They sort of want to federalize the process,
which is not going to be realistic. When you put money into state
parties, that's a state issue and the state has to deal with that,
and they don't want federal involvement.''
   Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle, contacted in Dallas, said,
``Those folks in Washington, D.C., are looking through the wrong
end of the telescope, and I don't know if a microscope would help.''
   Slagle said the Democratic party in Texas, which has not been
carried by a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976, is more
interested in protecting its state and local candidates from a
Republican sweep than in promoting a presidential candidate.
   Slagle's Republican counterpart, Fred Meyer, said his party uses
contributions that are exempt from federal limits for research,
recruitment and training of candidates and for administrative
functions.
   But Ms. Miller said the group found ``obvious patterns of
questionable soft money giving. No wonder voters have so little
confidence in our politicians when they are sabotaging our laws
like this.''
   Ms. Miller said the group concluded soft money was used toward
the presidential race because 11 individuals and eight businesses
each contributed more than $100,000 in the nine states and 42
percent of the money came from out-of-state sources including the
two national political parties. Also, much of the money was given
in key presidential states and about a third of the money was given
in the last four weeks.
   Although corporations and labor unions are barred from
contributing directly to campaigns for federal office, and
individual contributions are limited, they may make unlimited
contributions in most states for state and local campaigns, party
building and voter drives.
   This is called ``soft money'' and is not supposed to be used in
campaigns for federal office. The center wants such contributions
brought under federal control.
   The study covered 7,098 contributions by individuals,
corporations, unincorporated businesses, trade associations and the
Democratic and Republican national committees to state parties in
California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania,
North Carolina, Texas and Washington.
   Individuals gave $9.2 million to Republican state parties and
$1.8 million to Democratic state parties. Corporations gave nearly
$6.5 million, almost of a third of it to the Republican parties.
   Soft money contributions to Republican parties from all sources
came to $16.7 million and to $11.8 million for Democratic parties,
according to the study. Republicans received more than Democrats in
all states except Texas and Pennsylvania.
   California had the largest infusion of soft money, $5.8 million
to the Republican party and $4.4 million to the Democrats.
   Other state totals were: Florida, $4.7 million; Illinois, $4.4
million; Texas, $3.2 million; Colorado, $2.1 million; Missouri,
$1.5 million; Washington just under $1 million; Pennsylvania
$883,000 and North Carolina $345,286.
   ``The bottom line is we do not go above the law or Federal
Election Commission regulations when we are putting money into
states for various races,'' Ms. Terzano said. ``We put our money
into the state, and we use it and the money is directed according
to FEC regulations.''

<HEAD>OMB Details Where Hundreds of Billions of Tax Dollars in Jeopardy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top managers of federal agencies believe tens
of billions of tax dollars are jeopardized by waste, fraud and
shoddy practices, according to an inventory of ``high-risk
programs'' compiled by the Office of Management and Budget.
   The list is a department-by-department blueprint of costly flaws
in the way the federal government conducts the people's business.
It was made public Tuesday by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   He noted that warnings about the Department of Housing and Urban
Development went unheeded until flaws grew into an estimated $6
billion crisis and praised budget director Richard Darman for
trying to identify ``programs which could become our next HUDs.''
   ``He's really bringing some of these things to light ... so that
we'll know if there are any more of those HUD situations out
there,'' Glenn said.
   OMB confirmed it gave the list to Glenn. Spokeswoman Barbara
Clay said the administration plans to work closely with Glenn to
develop ``management systems and internal controls sufficient to
deal with the high risks identified on the list.''
   The list detailed problems with more than 70 programs. Among
them:
   _The Department of Defense pays for goods it doesn't receive and
can't account for, or adequately trace, $56.5 billion worth of
government property that's in the hands of government contractors.
   _There's a $58.5 billion difference between the amount of money
the Social Security Administration records say has been received
from workers and the amount indicated by Internal Revenue Service
records.
   _At the Patent and Trademark Office, 1.89 million documents are
missing or misfiled.
   Glenn has been holding a series of hearings on government
efficiency.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, told
Glenn's committee last month that ``inadequate financial controls''
resulted in the loss of $4 billion at the Department of Veterans
Affairs, more than $10 billion in military sales and loans to
foreign governments and $12 billion dollars at the Commodity Credit
Corp.
   ``All of the major agencies have serious problems,'' Comptroller
General Charles Boucher told the committee. ``Unfortunately, time
and time again we find situations where agencies and auditors have
identified problems, yet the corrective actions taken, if any, are
ineffective and the problems remain uncorrected for years.''
   In October, Darman told the committee the list of risky areas
was being put together with the intention of devoting ``significant
attention to correcting these vulnerabilities over time.''
   ``I have instructed OMB budget staff to give priority to
providing resources to needed corrections,'' Darman testified.
   He also said the problems encountered at HUD ``are not unique.''
   Darman said he asked federal managers to report weaknesses that
might lead to waste and fraud, and their reports showed ``HUD
wasn't the worst. It was in the middle of the pack, which leads one
to worry about any number of other big problems out there.''
   The 27-page list covers the well-publicized problems at HUD and
at the Energy Department's nuclear plants and highlights numerous
others.
   The list criticizes the financial controls set up for the
Superfund environmental cleanup program. The Environmental
Protection Agency doesn't log some ``accounts receivable'' until
payments come in, and the EPA's inspector general found $8 million
of such accounts in one regional office, the report said.
   The Treasury Department reported the IRS has failed to collect
more than $63 billion worth of delinquent taxes.
   The list also noted Department of Veterans Affairs compensation
and pension programs have made $53 million in overpayments. Benefit
decisions ``have not always been appropriate or correct,'' the
document said.

<HEAD>Hearings `Just the Beginning' of S&amp;L Probe: Gonzalez</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee
says hearings that led to the resignation of savings and loan
regulator M. Danny Wall are ``just the beginning'' of his
investigation of the S&amp;L crisis.
   Wall resigned just two weeks after the committee completed 50
hours of hearings focusing on the regulator's handling of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Lincoln is expected to become the nation's biggest S&amp;L failure,
expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.
   ``This is just the beginning,'' Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said in a telephone interview Tuesday from his home in San Antonio.
``We started with Lincoln because it's the prototype ... of
everything that went wrong.''
   Gonzalez said he may conduct more hearings on Lincoln and the
panel later would explore other S&amp;L failures, including Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver, Colo.
   The Silverado case is politically sensitive because President
Bush's son, Neil Bush, served on Silverado's board of directors.
   Gonzalez said the committee will concentrate on the
constitutional question of how in 1988 Wall's agency, without
specific congressional authorization, was able to commit the
government to spending $40 billion on S&amp;L rescues. The panel also
will explore whether the FBI should have more vigorously pursued
shady S&amp;L executives.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater avoided questions about
whether the president or his top aides wanted Wall to quit.
   ``He resigned and it will be accepted,'' he said.
   Under legislation enacted in August, the director of the thrift
office serves a five-year term and must be confirmed by the Senate,
which returns from holiday recess next month.
   According to an industry source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Treasury officials who oversee Wall's agency favor
appointing an experienced regulator to succeed Wall. Early
speculation is centered on several officials who have worked for
either the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
   Neither Wall nor his immediate predecessor, Edwin Gray, had
regulatory experience. Wall had served as staff director of the
Senate Banking Committee under Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah. Gray was a
former public relations executive and press secretary to Ronald
Reagan's 1980 campaign.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a member of the House Banking Committee,
said the new thrift regulator ``has to be able to stand up to
powerful interests within the industry, on Capitol Hill and,
frankly, within the administration. ... He's got to be able to
inspire public confidence.''
   ``You need someone who does not come out of the political
environment as Wall did. Rather, you need a tough, experienced
regulator who has a long history in banking regulation and knows
the ins and outs of the industry,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., also a banking panel member.
   Wall, in a news conference announcing his resignation Monday,
defended his record and said Gonzalez resorted to ``corruption of
the truth and abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play.''
   Gonzalez dismissed Wall's complaint Tuesday.
   ``Down here in Texas ... we know that when a skunk is frightened
and retreating _ that is when he is spraying the hardest.''
   The committee chairman also rejected complaints his intense
criticism of Wall had made it all but impossible for the
administration to find someone else willing step into the cross
fire.
   ``Watergate didn't deter people from running for the
presidency,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin in
Washington was preparing to hear arguments Thursday in a lawsuit
challenging the federal takeover of Lincoln.
   Among the witnesses subpoenaed are Charles H. Keating Jr.,
chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent company.
Leonard Bickwit, an attorney for American Continental, declined
Tuesday to indicate whether Keating would testify or assert his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Keating is the subject of a federal grand jury probe in Los
Angeles and the target of a $1.1 billion federal fraud and
racketeering suit.
   Among the 11 individual defendants in the fraud suit is
Keating's brother, William J. Keating, a former two-term Republican
member of Congress who is chief executive officer of the Detroit
Newspaper Agency and chairman of the board of directors of The
Associated Press.
   William Keating is not accused of fraud or racketeering, but is
named in three of 15 counts and is accused of negligence and breach
of fiduciary duty.
   William Keating, who served on the American Continental board,
has said he attended only two board meetings. His lawyer, Chester
Kamin, has said he was seeking to have William Keating's name
removed from the government's suit.
   William Keating on Tuesday declined to comment on the suit,
saying, ``As long as this matter is in litigation, I'm not really
able to discuss that.''

   Sweden's attorney general has decided
against prosecuting a magazine for defamation after it quoted the
wife of former Swedish tennis great Bjorn Borg as saying, ``Swedes
are stupid nobodies.''
   The remark attributed to Loredana Borg, a former Italian rock
singer who married Borg in September, appeared on the advertising
billboard of the celebrity and gossip weekly Svensk Damtidning.
   Attorney General Hans Stark received a complaint from an
unidentified person who said that the headline violated the law
forbidding ``agitation against an ethnic group.''
   Stark told the TT news agency on Tuesday he was dismissing the
complaint.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer is receiving an
honorary degree Thursday from the University of South Florida,
which is sending a delegation thousands of miles to hand him the
award.
   The group headed to Moscow on Tuesday to award Hammer a
doctorate of humane letters.
   ``This is the first time an American citizen has received a
degree from an American university in the Soviet Union,'' said Bob
Clodius, president of the National Association of University and
Land Grant Colleges in Washington.
   University of South Florida President Francis Borkowski said the
award recognizes Hammer's humanitarian, cultural and philanthropic
contributions.
   ``Armand Hammer has been perhaps the single most influential
American in the Soviet Union,'' Borkowski said. ``He has
contributed to glasnost and perestroika. That's why we are giving
him the degree in the Soviet Union.''
   Hammer, the 91-year-old chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
has been an unofficial business envoy to the Soviet Union since
1921. He has used his influence to allow U.S. doctors and rescue
teams to travel to the Soviet Union to aid in the Chernobyl nuclear
accident and the Armenian earthquake.

   Congress' oldest member offered
the secret of a long life as he marked his birthday: a good diet
and exercise.
   ``If a person follows that, then they will have a chance to live
a happier life and help humanity,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Thurmond, who turned 87 Tuesday, said he watches his diet and
exercises 50 minutes each morning, doing calisthenics, lifting
weights and riding a stationary cycle.
   He said he also tries to keep an optimistic outlook on life.
   He came to this city just northwest of Charleston with U.S.
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to announce a $32 million
emergency grant for repairs to highways damaged by Hurricane Hugo.

   Wu'er Kaixi and Li Lu, exiled Chinese student
leaders, accepted a $30,000 human rights award but lamented that
two of their allies in the spring uprising at Tiananmen Square were
still in China.
   Rock star Sting presented the 1989 Reebok Human Rights Award to
China's crushed student democracy movement, represented by Wu'er
and Li during a ceremony Tuesday.
   ``It is very frightening to me that I live and my children live
in a world where governments routinely discard basic human decency
and violate human rights,'' Sting said at the presentation.
   Wu'er sent a message to friends still in China, saying, ``Take
care of yourselves when the cold of midnight hits you.''
   A videotape interview with another student leader, Chai Ling,
was flashed on a screen.
   ``She was my best friend in Tiananmen Square,'' Li said. ``Chai
Ling was the heart of the democracy movement.''
   Organizers placed two empty chairs on the stage for Chai, whose
name is on a wanted list and Wang Dan, a student leader now in jail.

   John De Lorean is back in the car business.
   Nationwide, 404 Toys ``R'' Us stores are selling a pint-size
version of the De Lorean car featured in the movie ``Back to the
Future Part II'' under a licensing agreement between Universal City
Studios Inc. and the former Detroit automaker. De Lorean said he
would get about 5 percent of the toy car's sales.
   ``By the time I give up on them, it will be `Back to the Future
Part 71,''' De Lorean said Tuesday in a telephone interview from
New York City.
   In the original movie and the sequel, stars Christopher Lloyd
and Michael J. Fox use a modified De Lorean to travel through time.
   The original De Lorean _ a gull-winged door, stainless-steel
body sports car _ was produced in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from
1981 until October 1982, when the British government shut down the
plant after 9,000 cars were made.
   That month, De Lorean was arrested on a drug trafficking charge
in Los Angeles, for which he was acquitted. He has been in and out
of court since then in divorce and bankruptcy proceedings.

   Bill Cosby and the rest of NBC's Thursday
night lineup helped the network win the ratings sweeps for November.
   November is one of four months in which the size of a network's
audience is used to determine an affiliate's advertising rates.
   NBC placed six shows, its Thursday programs plus ``The Golden
Girls'' from Saturday, in last week's top 10, according to the A.C.
Nielsen Co.
   NBC's average prime-time rating for the week was 15.4. ABC's was
13.2 and CBS' 11.6. Each rating point represents the percentage of
the nation's 92.1 million households tuned to a show.
   NBC leads for the season with 15.0 to ABC's 13.4 and CBS' 12.3.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was first, followed by NBC's ``Cheers''
and a Thursday night preview of its comedy series ``Ann Jillian,''
which is slated for Sunday nights. ABC's ``Roseanne'' was fourth.
Others in top 10: NBC's ``Dear John,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,''
CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes''
and ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' tied.
   The NBC Monday night movie, ``Little White Lies,'' starring Miss
Jillian and Tim Matheson, was 17th for the week. ABC's ``Hallmark
Hall of Fame'' presentation of ``The Shell Seekers,'' starring
Angela Lansbury, tied for 22nd with NBC's ``Night Court.''
   The lowest-rated network show was ABC's ``Living Dolls.''
   Among the evening news shows, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was
first for the ninth straight week, including two ties with CBS. Its
lead over the second place news show is the largest since the ABC
news show began in 1952. ABC was first last week with 11.5, CBS had
10.3 and NBC 10.2.

   The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press will
increase the price of their daily papers to 25 cents from 15 cents
and 20 cents, respectively, the newspapers announced Tuesday.
   The increases had been anticipated since the newspapers began a
partial merger Nov. 27. Advertisers also will begin paying higher
rates Sunday because of the joint operating agreement.
   The newspapers are merging business, advertising, production and
circulation operations to cut costs while keeping separate news and
editorial departments.
   The Free Press remains a morning newspaper weekdays. The News
will have one morning edition available for street sales only and
three editions for afternoon home delivery. There will be joint
weekend editions under the masthead of The Detroit News and Free
Press.
   The price for the Sunday edition will go up to $1 from 75 cents
this Sunday.
   Robert J. Hall, publisher and chairman of the Free Press, said
he hopes the newspapers, the ninth- and 10th-largest in the
country, will maintain their circulation.
   Home subscription rates will remain unchanged at least through
December, said William J. Keating, president and chief executive
officer of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which handles business and
publishing matters for the newspapers.
   Wednesday's edition of the Free Press said the DNA had begun
telling advertisers of its new rates, but company officials
declined to disclose the size of the increase.
   The JOA, first requested in 1986, was approved by then-Attorney
General Edwin Meese in 1988 but stalled by court challenges from a
coalition of readers and advertisers. Legal delays ended Nov. 13,
when the U.S. Supreme Court's 4-4 tie on an appeal let stand lower
court rulings upholding the agreement.

   Federal health officials say laboratory
findings that very high doses of the anti-AIDS drug AZT cause
tumors in aging laboratory rodents should cause little concern for
people with AIDS.
   Dr. James Mason, the top health official at the Department of
Health and Human Services, said that while the results are
significant, they do not show AZT causes cancer in humans.
   ``The Public Health Service still strongly recommends that AIDS
patients ... continue their zidovudine (AZT) therapy under
consultation with their physicians,'' Mason said Tuesday.
   Dan Hoth, director of the AIDS division at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted in the study
conducted by the maker of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome Co., the rodents
received much higher doses of AZT for a much longer time than AIDS
patients do.
   ``We know that AZT prolongs life in humans (with AIDS),'' he
said. ``When you compare that known benefit of AZT to the
theoretical risk of tumors, the only right thing to do is to
continue using AZT.''
   AZT is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration that attacks the AIDS virus directly. It was
approved in March 1987.
   More than 40,000 AIDS patients take AZT in the United States. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   Burroughs Wellcome Co. sent notice to physicians informing them
of the study's findings that some of the rats and mice that
received very high doses of AZT for most of their normal life spans
developed vaginal tumors at the end of their lives.
   The results, the company said, ``are of limited predictive value
for humans.''
   Though the results raise the possibility of a carcinogenic
potential in general, they should not be interpreted as applying
only to the vagina or to women, said company spokeswoman Kathy
Bartlett.
   The company said in its study that high doses of AZT were given
to 360 female rats and mice for about 22 months, almost their
entire normal life span. The test rodents were divided into three
groups and each given different doses of the drug.
   Of the 120 receiving the highest dose, seven developed cancerous
vaginal tumors and two had benign vaginal tumors, Burroughs
Wellcome said. One benign tumor was found in the group receiving
the middle dose while no treatment-related tumors were seen at the
lowest dose, the company said.
   The company said no treatment-related tumors were observed in an
equal number of male rodents.
   ``Tumors in rodents were observed on laboratory examination
toward the end of their life-span, and only in animals which had
received very high doses of zidovudine,'' said the company, based
in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   Burroughs Wellcome's studies were part of routine tests that are
carried out on new drugs and take about three years to conduct, the
company said.

   From engaging Mikhail Gorbachev in the stormy
Med to taking Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to the ballpark or
picking up the phone for a chat with the pope, President Bush's
brand of diplomacy is personal and non-stop.
   Bush has traveled to 14 countries as president. And, according
to White House statisticians, he has held 105 separate one-on-one
meetings with presidents, prime ministers and kings.
   Just home from his meeting with the Soviet leader at Malta and
with NATO allies in Brussels, Bush is getting ready to embark on
yet another foreign trip _ a meeting next week with French
President Francois Mitterrand on the Caribbean island of St. Martin.
   True to Bush's whirlwind style, he'll squeeze that trip into one
day, leaving Washington early in the morning and returning late at
night.
   Those leaders Bush can't get around to meeting this year he'll
just have to phone _ or meet next year.
   So far on the 1990 calendar there's a drug summit in Latin
America in February, an expected trip to Australia and one to
Africa being considered. A 23-nation summit in Vienna to sign an
arms treaty has been proposed by Bush, and at some point there's
bound to be a Moscow summit.
   Bush conducts diplomacy like he plays golf: he rushes from one
event to the next. When he isn't personally entertaining them, he's
reaching out to touch world leaders by phone.
   In the days before his waterlogged summit with Gorbachev, Bush
met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and called the other 13 NATO allies
by phone, according to press spokesman Bob Hall. He also called the
leaders of Japan, Korea and Israel to discuss the summit.
   To discuss the issue of U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon,
Bush made a transatlantic phone call to Pope John Paul II last
summer. Bush met the pope during a visit to Italy in May.
   Bush works quickly to try to establish a personal rapport with
world leaders. He took Mrs. Thatcher for a ride in a golf cart,
escorted Mitterrand through the woods and over the rocks at his
oceanfront home in Maine and took a somewhat bewildered Mubarak by
presidential helicopter to a Baltimore Orioles baseball game.
   He has invited Mrs. Thatcher, Prince Charles and Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md.
   He persuaded Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter and his wife
to visit him in Kennebunkport, Maine, on their honeymoon visit to
the United States.
   And he showed off the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum to
Jordan's King Hussein.
   ``He has used the personal touch much more than most past
presidents,'' said deputy press secretary Alixe Glen.
   Even though the summit with Gorbachev was curtailed and
logistics disrupted by a fierce storm, the two met long enough for
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to declare: ``There's a
potential for real chemistry here between these two leaders.''
   Of his meeting with Gorbachev, Bush said: ``The emotional part
of it is hard to describe for me because I'm not the most
articulate emotionalist. But I just can't have asked for a better
ambiance, a better feel from the meetings, even though the
differences are acute in some areas.''
   Gennadi Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, paid Bush an indirect
compliment, suggesting he was far better prepared than former
President Reagan. Gerasimov joked that Bush had left his ``thick
reference book somewhere else, I guess on another ship.''
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who
specializes in the presidency, said Bush's ability to establish
personal relationships with world leaders ``turns out to be
extremely useful.''
   ``The agenda of the world is involving the American president
very deeply and probably will for the rest of Bush's term,'' Hess
said.
   Anyway, Hess added, even though Bush claimed he wanted to be the
education president, ``what he really wanted to be all along was
the `international-affairs president.'''

<HEAD>$1 Billion Construction Contract Narrowed To Three Groups of Firms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three teams of firms remain in the running for
a $1 billion contract to manage engineering and construction of the
$5.9 billion supercollider, say industry and congressional
officials.
   Officials said a final decision on the contractor would be made
next year. The award would be the largest single contract involved
in building the super collider, a 53-mile underground ring where
scientists would test theories about the building blocks of the
universe by smashing together atomic particles.
   The offices of Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, and Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, announced the three finalist teams late Tuesday and said
they had been chosen from a field of 14 competitors.
   ``The fact that these invitations have already been made
indicates that the SSC program is right on schedule,'' said Barton,
whose district includes the superconducting supercollider site.
   Officials representing some of the firms involved confirmed
their selection late Tuesday, and said their companies had learned
of the decision from the Energy Department. Confirmation from DOE
was not immediately available.
   The finalist teams were identified as: Fluor-Daniel, the
construction arm of Fluor Corp. of Irvine, Calif., and ICF Kaiser
Engineers Inc. of Oakland, Calif.; Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and
Douglas Inc. of New York City, MK Ferguson Co. of Cleveland, a
subsidiary of Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, and CRSS of
Houston; and a joint venture of Daniel, Mann, Johnson and
Mendenhall of Los Angeles and Bechtel National Inc. of San
Francisco.
   Jess Hawley, a spokesman for Morrison Knudsen, said University
Research Associates, a management and operations entity working on
behalf of the Energy Department, would employ the chosen contractor.
   Congress this year appropriated $225 million to begin initial
construction of the SSC.

   The number of reported cases of a sometimes
fatal blood disorder linked to the nutritional supplement
L-tryptophan is up to 720, federal health officials say.
   While the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
continues to investigate cases reported by state health
departments, the Food and Drug Administration is testing samples of
the substance and making sure it remains off store shelves and
stopped in U.S. ports.
   As of Tuesday, 720 cases from 48 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico had been reported to the CDC. One death
has been reported and others are being investigated.
   Only Alaska and South Dakota have reported no cases.
   The CDC has established a link between the nutritional
supplement and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is marked by
severe muscle and joint pain, swelling of the arms and legs, skin
rash and sometimes fever.
   L-tryptophan, an amino acid, is found naturally in many foods.
Some people take supplements of L-tryptophan to treat
sleeplessness, depression, premenstrual syndrome, stress and other
problems.
   The Food and Drug Administration said it has been detaining all
L-tryptophan shipments, including bulk supplies of the supplement,
at U.S. ports as a follow-up to its Nov. 17 request for a
nationwide recall of L-tryptophan tablets, capsules and caplets.
   The investigation has not established whether L-tryptophan
itself or some contaminant introduced during manufacture or
distribution is causing the syndrome. The FDA said it has collected
several hundred products and has begun to analyze them for possible
evidence of chemical or microbial contamination.
   FDA investigators recently visited L-tryptophan manufacturing
plants in Japan, a leading supplier of the supplement to U.S.
manufacturers. Japanese officials have been cooperating with
American investigators, the FDA said.
   The CDC's initial analysis of data on 85 cases shows most of
those who developed the syndrome were women taking between 1 and 2
grams per day of L-tryptophan, the FDA said. The daily intake of
the supplement ranged from 150 milligrams to 18 grams.

judicial complex.
   Ms. Casolo had made a sworn deposition to military Judge
Guillermo Romero in a closed, four-hour session. If convicted, she
faces 20 years in prison.
   ``I'm being taken to the women's prison. It's a place I've taken
many delegations, a place where I've interviewed many prisoners. I
guess now I'll be on the other side,'' she told reporters as she
left the judge's chambers.
   Romero avoided reporters and there was no indication when the
case would go to trial.
   A native of Thomaston, Conn. and a former Seattle resident, Ms.
Casolo has represented Christian Educational Seminars in El
Salvador for nearly five years. The San Antonio-based organization
arranges fact-finding tours for Americans, including congressmen.
   She denies collaborating with leftist guerrillas, who have been
fighting a 10-year-old war against a succession of U.S.-backed
governments and last month turned the capital into a combat zone
with their largest offensive ever.
   Ms. Casolo says she knows nothing of the more than 20,000 rounds
of assault rifle ammunition, explosives and detonator caps police
say they found buried behind her house on Nov. 25. She rented the
house three months ago, she says, and has been traveling much of
the time since then.
   Members of the military and the rightist administration of
President Alfredo Cristiani have accused clergy and church workers
of sympathizing with and even aiding the rebels.
   During last month's offensive, six Jesuit priests were murdered
during a nighttime curfew by men said by a witness to have been in
uniform. Elements connected to the military are widely believed to
be responsible.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who came to help in
Ms. Casolo's defense, says deportation is probably the easiest way
out for her. But Ms. Casolo says she wants to face the charges.
   ``The accusations against me are false,'' she told reporters
Tuesday. ``This is a first step and the rest will be decided by the
long judicial process here.
   ``Let us prove our innocence publicly. We're not going to go
behind the scenes,'' she said.
   Wearing a white blouse and beige skirt, she appeared tired but
in good spirits when she talked with reporters before and after
meeting with the judge. Ms. Casolo had spent 10 days under arrest
at National Police headquarters, where she said she spent evenings
singing hymns and reading the Bible with other prisoners and talked
about scripture with her wardens.
   ``I have faith in all the people who have written me letters, in
their prayers,'' Ms. Casolo said before being driven off to prison.
   ``I can't say I have faith in the system to find me innocent.
But I believe my innocence will shine through.''
   Clark, who left the country on Tuesday, said he would return to
help with the trial. He said he believed her chances for acquittal
were good.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said charging Ms. Casolo was a
mistake and vowed to continue his efforts to win her release.
   ``I believe the prosecutors in the Casolo case have made a
terrible mistake _ a regrettable mistake,'' Dodd said in a
statement late Tuesday. ``But this is only one step in a judicial
process, and I believe the truth will out. As long as it takes, I
will continue to work for Jennifer Casolo's release.''
   Dodd is chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

<TEXT>
   Despite a country in chaos, East German
leaders have managed to make more diplomatic breakthroughs with
West Germany in the last two days than in the last two decades.
   A planned summit, the establishment of a hard currency fund for
tourists, and agreements on trade, transportation and the
environment all have defied the turbulence at the top.
   The accomplishments testify both to the stubborn resolve of
those Communists still in power to keep the country working, and to
West Germany's decision to act quickly while East Germany is
overwhelmed by events.
   Two East German Communist leaderships have fallen in less than
two months, so one might expect the wheels of government and
diplomacy to have slowed.
   But in East Germany's case, the tumult has actually accelerated
an orderly effort to close gaps and work together on projects of
mutual interest.
   Under the terms of an agreement reached between the two Germanys
on Tuesday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will visit East
Germany on Dec. 19.
   Kohl will meet Communist Premier Hans Modrow in Dresden, rather
than in the capital of East Berlin, to avoid de facto recognition
of the sovereignty of East Germany.
   The West German leader's refusal to travel to East Berlin was a
condition that Erich Honecker, who led East Germany for 18 years
until his mid-October ouster, found unacceptable.
   Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, met with Modrow on
Tuesday in talks that made progress in a broad array of issues
concerning both states.
   Seiters and Modrow issued a joint account of their talks,
describing them as productive and businesslike and ticking off an
impressive list of accomplishments.
   The thorniest issue settled was providing East German tourists
with convertible currency for trips to the West.
   West Germany has traditionally offered 100-mark gifts, about
$54, of ``welcome money'' to East German arrivals once each year
because East Germany only would convert the equivalent of $8 a day
for travelers.
   Seiters announced that the West German budget for welcome money
next year, $405 million, was being handed over to East Berlin to
contribute to a hard-currency pool for tourists.
   Modrow explained that under the agreement, East German adults
will be entitled to receive up to $108 per year in hard currency,
and parents can receive another 100 West German marks for each
child under 14.
   East Germany, in turn, has agreed to drop a mandatory exchange
rule that required West Germans visiting the Communist state to
convert to East German marks (at an unfavorable rate) at least
$13.50 for each day they were in the country.
   West Germans also will no longer need visas to enter East
Germany after Jan. 1, when the new currency exchange system also
takes effect.
   The governments further agreed to study transit improvements
between their states and Bonn promised to help East Germany upgrade
its outmoded and overwhelmed telephone network.
   Agreements were reached on joint efforts to improve
environmental protection in East Germany _ one of Europe's most
polluted nations. Expanded rail links between the countries also is
to be explored.
   Modrow also said East Germany would boost its trade with West
Germany by $16.2 million next year.
   Kohl told reporters in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday that he
planned to follow through on his intent to visit East Germany
before Christmas despite the resignation Sunday of Communist Party
chief Egon Krenz, the full party Politburo and the 163-member
Central Committee.
   ``I will meet with Premier Modrow and whoever is elected party
leader at the special congress,'' he said at a press conference
following the gathering of NATO leaders.
   A special party congress is set for Dec. 15-17 at which a new
leadership is to be named. In the interim, a 25-person panel is
running party affairs, and Modrow as government leader is empowered
to handle diplomatic affairs.
   The Communists face widespread opposition both from grass-roots
movements that want a share of power and from several small parties
that used to vote with the Communists as a bloc but now are
exercising relative independence.
   Kohl has unveiled a 10-point plan for improving ties with East
Germany that aims at eventual reunification, and he drew some
support for the endeavor from President Bush at the NATO meeting.
   West Germany may be intensifying its contacts with East Germany
in the absence of a clear party leadership in belief that the
government structure, which includes 11 non-Communist ministers, is
more capable than the Communist hierarchy of entering into
agreements that the public will support.
   Modrow is a member of the Communist Party, but has long
advocated democratic changes and enjoys more support among East
Germans than any other party figure.

   While changes in the Earth's climate threaten
to encourage the spread of diseases like rabies, the changes may
also damage the human body's ability to fight them, health
officials are warning.
   A conference on ``Global Atmospheric Change and Public Health''
was told Tuesday that potential problems stem both from the
increase in ultraviolet radiation, as the protective ozone layer in
the stratosphere is damaged, and from climate warming, which many
scientists believe is occurring in a so-called Greenhouse effect.
   Ultraviolet radiation, already known to cause skin cancer, also
has a major effect in reducing the response of the human immune
system, said Dr. Raymond Daynes of the University of Utah.
   At the same time the immune system damage is being threatened,
warming of the climate could lead to the spread of diseases
currently limited by the climate, said Dr. Robert E. Shope of the
Yale University School of Medicine.

<HEAD>Measure Signed by Bush Protects Nevada Wilderness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More land in Nevada would be protected from
development, timber harvesting and mineral exploration under
legislation that has been signed into law by President Bush.
   The measure, signed Tuesday, creates 733,400 acres of protected
wilderness in Nevada and opens another 2.4 million acres to
multiple use under the management of the Agriculture Department.
   The legislation puts a total of 2 percent of the state's land
under wilderness protection, preventing development and such uses
as timber harvesting, mineral exploration or intrusion by campers
in vehicles.
   However, the legislation protects existing grazing rights for
ranchers on the wilderness land, and low-level military flights
over four of the new wilderness areas, a White House spokesman said.

<HEAD>Safety Panel: School Bleachers at Risk of Collapsing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Certain indoor school bleachers are at risk of
collapsing because of poor maintenance and improper operation,
school officials are being told.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission warned school
administrators nationwide Tuesday that bleachers should be
routinely inspected and maintained at least twice a year.
   In addition, only trained personnel, not students, should be
used to operate the bleachers, the commission said in a statement.
   The commission said recent collapses of school gymnasium
bleachers prompted the warning, which involves manual, telescoping
bleachers made from 1966 to 1979 by Michigan-based Interkal and
sold under the trade names ``Brunswick,'' ``Vecta'' and
``Interkal.''
   The commission said 16 collapses since 1978 have produced back,
arm, leg and ankle injuries.

   President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday
declared a state of national emergency throughout the Philippines.
   Mrs. Aquino issued the proclamation on the sixth day of the most
serious armed bid to topple her nearly 4-year-old government.
   ``Upon my directive, appropriate emergency measures shall
henceforth be strictly carried out by the duly authorized head of
the concerned agency of the government,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   It was unclear what specific additional powers Mrs. Aquino would
be able to wield under the emergency declaration.
   On Monday, assistant Press Secretary Lourdes Sytangco said Mrs.
Aquino had turned down recommendations from some Cabinet members
that she declare a state of emergency to cope with the military
uprising.
   The announcement came as an estimated 400 rebel soldiers
continued to hold Manila's financial district and another 400 held
a military base on Cebu Island.
   Earlier in the day, the rebels and government forces had agreed
to a temporary cease-fire that allowed hundreds of Americans and
other foreigners to be evacuated from the embattled Makati
financial district.

<HEAD>Bishops, Catholic Politicians Lock Horns Over Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The link between faith and politics is being tested as the
threat of ecclesiastical sanctions hangs over Roman Catholic
officials targeted in a special appeal by the nation's bishops to
restrict legalized abortion.
   A California legislator banned from Communion for advocating
abortion rights held a narrow lead in a special election Tuesday.
But Catholic politicians everywhere are feeling the heat of an
aggressive church hierarchy that has banned dissent on abortion
among its 53-million members.
   ``I'm not as interested in getting re-elected as I am getting
into heaven,'' said state Sen. John Amari of Birmingham, Ala.
   Some Catholic lawmakers, noting the struggles of their
predecessors such as Al Smith and John F. Kennedy against
historical prejudices that they were surrogates for the Vatican,
say the bishops are out of line.
   ``The church has control over my moral life. It doesn't have
control over my political life,'' said Assembly Speaker-elect
Joseph Doria in New Jersey.
   With the U.S. Supreme Court opening the way for the states to
impose restrictions on abortion in its ruling in a Missouri case,
the bishops last month plunged into the debate by calling abortion
``the fundamental human rights issue.''
   They also said Catholic legislators have a special moral
responsibility to work to curtail abortion.
   The bishops did not take a stand on whether penalties should be
imposed, but several Catholic leaders said the church should
discuss the possibility and action has been taken in some dioceses.
   Lucy Killea, who clung to a 1,500-vote lead today in a special
election for the California Senate, was barred by San Diego Bishop
Leo T. Maher from receiving Communion because of her abortion
rights commercials.
   ``The bishop had an incredible impact on this race,'' said
Killea's GOP opponent, Assemblywoman Carol Bentley. ``In one
letter, he created an instant international celebrity and a
martyr.''
   Montana's bishops have asked Catholic politicians not to
publicly contradict the church on abortion, and two officials who
spoke at an abortion rights rally have been called on the carpet.
   In Providence, R.I., the diocesan newspaper told politicians
they had to sign a declaration supporting a constitutional
amendment against abortion if they wanted to advertise holiday
greetings.
   Many Catholic politicians are wondering if the sword of church
sanctions would fall on their heads.
   ``People have been waiting to see if the church is going to come
along with a sledgehammer to get Catholic politicians in line,''
said J. Alan Davitt, a lobbyist for the Catholic Church in Albany,
N.Y.
   As have many leaders of the abortion rights movement, the
bishops said the Supreme Court ruling permitting legislative action
strips the credibility of the ``I'm personally opposed, but ...'
reasoning.
   Philadelphia Archbishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua said neither
politicians nor the public can have a ``double conscience'' on
abortion.
   But many Catholic politicians still adhere to the policy
articulated in 1984 by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in defense of Vice
Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro: that public morality is a
matter of prudential political judgment.
   ``I personally oppose abortion, but before I commit to anything
I'm going to do a survey,'' said state Rep. Edward Sandoval of New
Mexico.
   Some said the bishops' hard-line stand will influence the public
policy debate on abortion.
   ``A lot of my constituents are Catholics. They are influenced by
what the bishops say _ as they should be and as I should be,'' said
state Sen. Mike Egan of Atlanta.
   But many predicted the prelates' stand would backfire.
   ``It's a complete misreading of America and our representative
form of government,'' said state Rep. Margarita Prentiss, a Seattle
Democrat and abortion rights advocate. ``Representatives are not
elected to represent their religious faith, they are elected to
represent their constituents.''
   But the prelates were unanimous in their defense of the right of
the church to enter into the debate, and even for individual
bishops to administer sanctions.
   ``The question of church-state relationship and separation is a
long and complex one. It is noxious to apply that principle if the
intent is to isolate the church from public discussion in regard to
public policy,'' said Archbishop John R. Roach of the Archdiocese
of St. Paul and Minneapolis.
   Some politicians agreed.
   ``When we talk about the First Amendment, we forget the first
part, free exercise of religion,'' said state Senate President Pro
Tempore David Roberti of California. ``With the Catholic Church,
people generally emphasize the separation of church and state and
not the free exercise of religion. There is the right of even
bishops and clergy to have free speech.''

<TEXT>
   A rocketry scientist convicted of
trying to ship sophisticated U.S. missile technology to Egypt has
been sentenced to 46 months in prison.
   Abdelkader Helmy, 41, also was fined $358,690 and ordered to
forfeit about a half-million dollars, all part of what prosecutors
said were $1 million in payments dispensed to Helmy by Egyptian
intelligence operatives via Swiss banks.
   ``This is not a cloak-and-dagger espionage case,'' U.S. District
Judge Raul Ramirez said at Tuesday's sentencing. ``This was a case,
to put it bluntly, of greed. ... He thought he would make a lot of
money and thought he would make a favor befall the sovereign nation
of Egypt.''
   Ramirez also credited Helmy for the 18 months he spent in jail
awaiting trial.
   The Egyptian-born U.S. citizen pleaded guilty in June to one
count of illegally exporting about 420 pounds of a carbon-based
material used in the construction of nose cones, rocket nozzles and
other weapons-related machinery. Eleven counts, including money
laundering and conspiracy, were dropped in return for the plea and
his promise to cooperate with prosecutors.
   ``I would like you to consider me as a human being,'' Helmy told
the judge, ``and human beings make mistakes. The United States is
my country and I never intended to hurt it.''
   The material, called carbon-carbon, had been developed in the
United States. It has a low visibility to radar and is heat
resistant. It is used extensively in Stealth aircraft, missiles and
rockets.
   Carbon-carbon is on the federal government's restricted list,
and its export requires a special license.
   An associate of Helmy's, 47-year-old James Huffman of Lexington,
Ohio, was sentenced to 41 months in prison and fined $7,500.
   Ramirez said Huffman, who worked as a representative of the
Hollister-based Teledyne Corp., reportedly used his expertise as a
20-year veteran marketing specialist to help Helmy in the exporting
scheme.
   Ramirez characterized the export scheme as a ``large, complex,
intricate conspiracy'' developed by the Egyptians with financial
backing from Iraq to get sensitive weapons-grade rocket materials.
   He said that had the conspiracy succeeded and the technology and
materials reached the Middle East, Egypt and Iraq had planned to
split the fruits of the scheme.
   An attorney for Helmy, Marcus S. Topel, had claimed his client
was recruited by Egypt's then-defense minister, Lt. Gen.
Abdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala.
   U.S. prosectors said two Egyptian nationals also have been
charged in the case. They are Ahmed Hussam Al-Din Khairat, an
Egyptian army officer who allegedly supervised the export scheme
from a headquarters in Austria, and Fuad Algamal, an Egyptian
colonel. Both are fugitives.
   The federal grand jury indictment also linked two other
Egyptians to the plot _ assistant military attache Abd Elrahin
Elgohary and Egyptian Col. Mohamed Abdalla Mohamed. Both men, who
had been based in Washington, D.C., claimed diplomatic immunity and
were not charged.
   Helmy was a top propulsion scientist at Aerojet General Corp.
near Sacramento.
   Helmy and Huffman were arrested in 1988 after U.S. Customs
agents seized a load of carbon material and other goods from an
aircraft waiting to take off for Egypt from Baltimore-Washington
Airport.

   The Soviet Union has warned West Germany not to
take advantage of the political upheaval in the East bloc by
pushing too quickly for reunification with East Germany.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany met with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze, on Tuesday to discuss a topic that was once
considered taboo between East and West.
   Afterward, the official Tass news agency quoted Shevardnadze as
recalling the Soviets' experience with a strong Germany during
World War II. It said he told Genscher that ``propaganda about a
federation of the two Germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in the
current circumstances.''
   ``An attempt to use difficulties in the reconstruction process
in socialist countries for one-sided, selfish goals, without taking
into account the long-term general European interests, can threaten
the accumulated positive developments, stability and peace on the
continent,'' Shevardnadze said.
   At the weekend superpower summit in Malta, Gorbachev cautioned
President Bush that a swift push toward reunification could create
tensions.
   Genscher told a news conference he assured Gorbachev that both
Germanys ``will keep in mind their responsibility for the security
of the whole of Europe.''
   Shevardnadze told Genscher, ``The current developments touch on
deep-rooted interests of the Soviet Union, the countries of the
Warsaw Pact and finally all Europeans.
   ``The Soviet people well remember history and the tragic lesson
of the Second World War,'' he said.
   Gorbachev in recent weeks has tempered his previous clear
opposition to reunification of West with East Germany, where public
unrest has toppled two governments in six weeks and acclerated
reform to a break-neck pace.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently outlined a detailed
plan for reunification.
   While objecting to any immediate call for reunification,
Gorbachev has indicated a willingness to let history decide.
   Tass said Monday that, ``Despite the acuteness of the problem,
the Soviet Union is prepared to discuss it in the spirit of new
thinking, presupposing respect for the stand of the other.''
   But according to Tass, Shevardnadze's side of the discussion
that resulted was strongly worded. He said some of the 10 points in
Kohl's reunification plan sounded like orders to East Germany,
``demanding irreversible changes in its political and economic
system.''
   A separate Tass report on Gorbachev's comment to Genscher was
far milder. Gorbachev said that under the present circumstances of
rapid change in Europe and improving relations between East and
West, ``it is especially important to support international
stability and to strengthen security,'' Tass reported.
   ``This suggests self-restraint, responsibility and deliberation
in actions from all states, and loyal cooperation on the basis of
generally accepted principles,'' Tass added, paraphrasing Gorbachev.
   Genscher told reporters that he assured Gorbachev, ``There is
not going to be a separate German course.''
   He said German rapprochement will occur only within general
European rapprochement, and ``we will do everything to create
stable, cooperative structures'' to ensure the security of Europe.
   Genscher refused to discuss Gorbachev's response.
   Tass also said that Genscher and Shevardnadze shared their
desires to reach agreements on the reduction of strategic offensive
weapons and conventional armed forces, and on a ban on chemical
weapons.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Mormons Who Exercise, Don't Smoke Live Longer Than Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eight-year study of 10,000 Mormons
suggests that people who exercise regularly and don't smoke live
longer, healthier lives.
   Dr. James Enstrom, who studied the habits of religiously active
Mormons in California, said his research shows those who follow the
church's teachings against using tobacco and who exercise and get
seven to eight hours sleep a night are far healthier than people in
the general white population.
   ``We knew from previous studies of Mormon death records that
this population has an unusually low cancer mortality rate that is
only partially explained by their lack of smoking,'' said Enstrom,
of the University of California, Los Angeles. ``The current study
allowed us to follow a large group of active Mormons over a long
period of time and to examine subgroups adhering to specific health
habits.''
   The study examined three general health habits: never smoking
cigarettes, regular physical exercise and regular sleep.
   The males involved in the study were all high priests, the
highest lay position in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. The women were wives of high priests.
   That particular group was selected, Enstrom said, because its
members would be more likely than other Mormons to strictly adhere
to church doctrine banning alcohol, tobacco and caffeine use.
   The study found that middle-age high priests who didn't smoke
and who exercised and slept well had 34 percent the rate of cancer
mortality as middled-aged white men in the United States. The high
priests also had only 14 percent the rate of cardiovascular disease
mortality and 22 percent the rate of overall mortality, Enstrom said
   Middle-age wives of high priests who followed the same health
habits had only a 55 percent rate of cancer death compared to
middle-aged white women, Enstrom said. They had a 34 percent rate
of cardiovascular disease mortality and a 47 percent rate of
overall mortality.
   Further, a 25-year-old high priest can expect to live to age 85,
compared with a life expectancy of 74 for 25-year-old white males,
Enstrom said.
   A 25-year-old high priest wife has a life expectancy of 86
years, compared with 80 for other white 25-year-old females,
Enstrom said.
   The results of the survey, conducted at the UCLA School of
Public Health, were to be published in the December issue of the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

   A teen-ager charged in the slaying of actress
Rebecca Schaeffer was ordered to stand trial for murder after
testimony from witnesses that included chilling, graphic accounts
of her killing.
   Municipal Judge David Horwitz ordered the trial after a daylong
preliminary hearing Tuesday into the death of the young woman who
starred in the old television series ``My Sister Sam.''
   Robert John Bardo, 19, of Tucson, Ariz., appeared groggy as he
came and went from the courtroom. Public defender Stephen Galindo
said he believed his client was on medication.
   The judge upheld a special circumstances charge _ lying in wait
_ that would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty if Bardo
is convicted of first-degree murder. Bardo will be arraigned Dec.
11.
   Prosecutors allege Bardo was the gunman who walked up to Miss
Schaeffer's apartment house on July 18 and opened fire when she
came to the door. The 21-year-old actress was struck once in the
chest and died.
   Among the witnesses was Miss Schaeffer's next-door neighbor,
actress Lynne Marta, who revealed that the intercoms in the
apartment house were broken when Miss Schaeffer responded to the
door buzzer by opening the security door.
   She said the young woman could not have talked to the person at
the door to find out who was there.
   ``I heard her pass my door,'' Ms. Marta said. ``In what seemed
like a second there was a blast that sounded like a cannon. The
door shook. The wall shook and the cat went up in the air. I fell
down on the floor.''
   Asked what happened next, the witness, in tears, said: ``I heard
Rebecca's first scream. I got to the phone and dialed 911. ...
Rebecca was moaning and wailing by the time I got to the door.
   ``I opened the little window hatch in the door and there was a
smell I will never forget as long as I live. It was the smell of
gunfire and it was quiet except for this little moaning.''
   Ms. Marta said she stepped into the hallway and called Miss
Schaeffer's name, but no response came. She said she stayed there
until paramedics arrived.
   Other witnesses told how Bardo spent three hours before the
attack clutching Miss Schaeffer's picture to his chest and stalking
her neighborhood in search of her apartment.
   Bardo had gotten her address from a private detective agency, a
witness said.
   In quick succession, five witnesses identified Bardo as the
young man who stalked Miss Schaeffer and was seen running away from
her house moments after gunshots and a scream shattered the calm of
the quiet neighborhood about 10:30 a.m.

   Winter tightened its grip today as temperatures continued to
plunge in the North, and snow was predicted in the northern
mountains of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah and in eastern parts of the
Lake Superior snowbelt.
   New England expected colder, windier weather today. Lows of
between 10 and 15 are expected tonight in northeastern New York and
northern Vermont.
   Snow advisories were posted today in the mountains of northern
and central Colorado, northern Wyoming _ where up to eight inches
of snow are possible _ and northern Utah, where up to a half-foot
of snow is predicted by this morning.
   The Great Lakes area expects partly cloudy, blustery weather and
lower temperatures today.
   A high-pressure front is expected to spawn sunshine and colder
temperatures in Wisconsin, the National Weather Service says.
   A cold front Tuesday night spread snow across the central
Rockies. Showers along the front extended from northern California
and southern Oregon to South Dakota and Nebraska. Snow fell in the
higher elevations, while light rain and drizzle prevailed in lower
altitudes.
   Clouds covered much of the Northeast Tuesday, with snow showers
in the Great Lakes region. Freezing rain pelted parts of the upper
Ohio Valley, and an advisory for freezing drizzle was issued for
most of western Pennsylvania.
   In the South Tuesday, sunny and dry weather prevailed. While
high temperatures hovered in the 20s in the Northeast states, the
mercury rose into the upper 60s and 70s across the south-central
states.
   Record temperatures were reported at Lincoln and Grand Island,
Neb., where 50-year-old records were bested with readings of 69.
   Temperatures warmed into the 70s in southern Arizona and crept
into the 70s and 80s Tuesday afternoon in Southern California.
   Tuesday's high temperature for the nation was 90 degrees at
Woodland Hills, Calif.

<HEAD>Cell Defect Found in Parkinson's Disease Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say they have detected a blood-cell
defect in people with Parkinson's disease, a link that could help
identify victims before symptoms appear.
   Such timely identification could open the door for earlier
treatment of the disease that afflicts 400,000 Americans.
   The findings, published Tuesday in the Annals of Neurology, are
the product of federally funded research by Dr. William Davis
Parker Jr., Dr. Sally J. Boyson and Janice K. Parks of the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.
   Parkinson's is a neurological condition characterized by
gradually worsening tremors, muscle rigidity and weakness _
symptoms blamed on the disappearance of key brain cells.
   The scientists reported finding what appears to be an enzyme
deficiency inside blood cells of Parkinson's patients, suggesting
the disease affects more than just the brain cells it kills.
   In normal cells, the enzyme is used to neutralize so-called free
radicals, the byproducts of oxidation. Free radicals have been
shown, in previous research, to be capable of killing the same
brain cells destroyed in Parkinson's disease.
   Scientists cautioned that the new conclusions offer no immediate
help for people with Parkinson's.
   But the rewards of nailing down the origins of Parkinson's would
be enormous.
   ``It sounds really exciting to me,'' said Dr. Stanley Fahn of
New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
   ``We've got to be cautious,'' added Fahn, who last month
co-authored the results of nationwide trials on the promising
anti-Parkinson's drug deprenyl.
   ``It certainly is a new direction. No one has ever found a
defect like this before,'' he said.

   Bread and pastries were recalled from
stores in six states after discovery of a broken light bulb in a
flour bin at a Memphis bakery.
   Continental Baking Co. officials said items covered by the
recall Tuesday were sent to stores throughout Arkansas, northern
Mississippi, northwest Alabama, southern Missouri, western
Tennessee and southeast Kentucky.
   The recall covers the Memphis bakery's full production for
Sunday and includes items with freshness dates of Dec. 10 and 11.
   Stores receiving the products were advised to pull them from
their shelves, and consumers were urged to return any purchased
items for refunds, said Patrick Farrell, a Continental spokesman
from St. Louis.
   No incidents were reported of glass being found in the recalled
bread and pastries, Farrell said.
   Farrell and bakery manager Chuck Ashworth said the recall was
issued after a broken light bulb was found in a storage bin which
held some 40,000 pounds of flour.
   Company officials did not know how the light bulb got in it.

<HEAD>More Active Volcanoes Found on Triton; Neptune Has 1,500 mph Winds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to four more active ice volcanoes on
Neptune's moon Triton were discovered in snapshots taken by Voyager
2, which found the planet itself is swept by 1,500 mph winds _ the
fastest yet seen in the solar system.
   Because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly
five of the geyser-like volcanoes erupting on only a portion of
Triton, ``chances are that there are a dozen of these things going
off globally'' at any time, said Torrence Johnson, a planetary
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   Confirmation of the first active volcano was announced Oct. 2
after scientists analyzed photos Voyager 2 snapped during its Aug.
24-25 flight past Neptune and Triton.
   Detection of more such volcanoes _ which spew nitrogen ice and
gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind _ was announced Tuesday
during a news conference at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Triton is only the third world in the solar system known to have
active volcanism. The others are Earth and Jupiter's moon Io, which
has sulfur-spewing volcanoes. Scientists suspect there are
volcanoes on cloud-shrouded Venus.
   Neptune's jet-stream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas
past the north edge of the planet's Earth-size, hurricane-like
Great Dark Spot at nearly 1,500 mph, Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone told reporters. That's about the speed of sound in
Neptune's atmosphere.
   ``These are the fastest we've observed,'' easily exceeding the
previous record winds of 1,100 mph in Saturn's jet stream, Stone
said. ``These almost may be supersonic winds ... a wind which is
Mach 1.''
   The speed of sound on Earth is about 700 mph, depending on
temperature and altitude. It's much faster on planets with colder
atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in Earth's air.
   The clouds racing in Neptune's winds could be seen in a movie
made by computer from still photographs taken by Voyager. Also
shown at Tuesday's news conference was another computer movie
clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on Triton,
Neptune's largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar
system.
   The plumes rise like columns, each forming a cloud that drifts
back and forth as it is blown downwind. A shadow cast by one cloud
also is visible.
   The movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three
more plumes, Johnson said.
   When Voyager swept past Triton early Aug. 25, scientists saw
streaks on dark material deposited on the moon's surface by what
they believed were active nitrogen-ice volcanoes.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced it
was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic
analysis of the photos.
   But the images were so fuzzy ``you had to take our word for
it,'' Johnson said.
   So NASA used a computer to overlap still photos taken from
different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly. The
resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes.
   The causes of Triton's nitrogen ice volcanoes and Neptune's high
winds are mysterious.
   Stone described one theory on the volcanoes: Darker material
settles on the moon's surface, then is covered by transparent
nitrogen ice. Sunlight penetrates the ice, and warms the darker
material beneath. But the heat cannot escape through the ice, so
some of the buried ice melts into gas, causing pressure to build
until the gas erupts upward through cracks, carrying ice and dark
material with it.
   Neptune gets 900 times less sunlight than Earth. Scientists are
perplexed about how the internal heat left over from Neptune's
formation is enough to drive 700-mph winds in the Great Dark Spot,
not to mention the 1,500-mph jet stream winds blowing between 15
and 20 degrees south latitude, Stone said.
   Part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in
the planet's atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is
needed to power high winds, he said.
   Voyager 2's Neptune-Triton exploration capped a 12-year mission
in which it flew past Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The spacecraft
discovered six moons at Neptune, bringing the total to eight, and
found several rings of debris orbiting the planet, which is 30
times farther from the sun than Earth.

<HEAD>Maryland Escrow Agent Dubbed `Robin HUD' Pleads Innocent in Housing
Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATTY REINERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman dubbed ``Robin HUD'' for her claims she
purchased cars and housing for the needy with stolen federal
housing money has pleaded innocent to embezzlement charges.
   Former escrow agent Marilyn Harrell pleaded innocent in U.S.
District Court Tuesday to charges she embezzled millions of dollars
from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Her attorney, public defender Anthony Gallagher, said the
innocent pleas mean ``a total denial of all allegations in the
indictment.'' He refused to comment further.
   Harrell, 46, did not make any statement during or after her
arraignment. She remains free on her own recognizance pending a
trial next month.
   She is accused of embezzling $5.6 million from HUD, making false
statements to the federal government and making false statements in
connection with a loan application. She is one of a dozen escrow
agents suspected of keeping more than $10 million they were
supposed to transfer to HUD.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has said the case
represents perhaps the largest single theft of government funds
ever charged against an individual.
   Harrell testified before Congress last summer during six months
of hearings into allegations of fraud, mismanagement and political
favoritism at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   She admitted stealing millions and buying 20 homes and nearly 40
automobiles for the needy before anyone noticed, earning her the
``Robin HUD'' nickname.
   Several top officials in HUD's Washington field office, to which
Harrell reported, were fired because of her case and other
allegations of mismanagement.
   Two weeks after Harrell testified, HUD seized her house in
Temple Hills, a Maryland suburb of Washington. The agency also
confiscated several other properties Harrell said she purchased
with HUD money to help charities and homeless families. Harrell is
living with her mother in Fort Washington, also a Washington suburb.
   As an escrow agent, Harrell collected money from the sales of
property that had been foreclosed on by the Federal Housing
Administration. The properties originally had been purchased with
HUD-guaranteed loans.
   Agents such as Harrell earn small commissions for handling the
foreclosures and turn over sales proceeds to the government.
Harrell told Congress that in 1985 she used sales proceeds to cover
a $37,000 shortfall in her business.
   She said that when several months passed without an inquiry from
HUD, she concluded the department was so poorly run that it was
unable to track the millions of dollars in payments due from escrow
agents.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two missiles were fired at the
home of the Spanish ambassador, causing some damage but no
injuries, police said. It was the fourth attack against Spanish
targets in six weeks.
   Two windows of the 18th-century building at The Hague's stately
Embassy Row were shattered by what appeared to be rocket-propelled
grenades, according to police spokesman Nico Laterveer.
   But the grenades apparently failed to explode, said Laterveer,
adding that the damage to the residence's interior was ``minimal.''
He did not know whether Ambassador Manuel Maria Sassot Canadas was
present at the time of the attack.
   The residence is about 25 yards from the Spanish Embassy.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Earlier reports indicated heavier damage. An explosion heard at
the time of the attack was believed to have been caused by the
firing mechanism of the grenades, Laterveer said.
   Dutch army explosives experts were carefully searching a gray
Mazda van parked in front of the building, from which the missiles
could have been fired, Laterveer said.
   ``Immediately after the explosion, a small fire broke out in
that car,'' Laterveer told reporters here.
   Minutes after the incident, police cordoned off the area near
the American and British embassies.
   On Oct. 24, a bomb destroyed the car of the Spanish consul in
Rotterdam. Three days later, two blasts damaged the trade mission
and the labor bureau here. One person was slightly injured in the
latter incident.
   Last month, the Basque terrorist organization ETA claimed
responsibility for those attacks. A statement in a Spanish
newspaper said they were in retaliation for the Netherlands' 1980
refusal to grant entry to three ETA members, who were subsequently
jailed in Spain.
   But today, Laterveer said that that claim had been ``assigned a
low priority'' by Dutch police, noting that the ETA seldom ventured
outside Spain.
   ``We have no idea who the perpetrators are,'' Laterveer said.

<HEAD>Volcanic Eruption That Gave Rise to Atlantis Legend Dated by NASA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A volcano that inspired the legend of the
lost civilization of Atlantis triggered summer frost, crop failure
and famine a half a world away, scientists said.
   The link enabled NASA scientists to date one of the most
powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history.
   Ancient Chinese annals tell how the climate was disrupted about
3,600 years ago after what scientists now know was the eruption of
Santorini volcano, which destroyed much of the Aegean island of
Thera, near what became Greece.
   The eruption was dated to 1600 B.C., give or take 30 years, by
researchers headed by astronomer Kevin Pang of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Pang presented the findings Tuesday during an American Geophysical
Union meeting.
   ``Not only are we able to get a date for this eruption _ if
people agree on the same century that's pretty good _ but we now
actually have eyewitness accounts of what happened (to the weather
thousands of miles away in China) after the Thera-Santorini
eruption,'' Pang said.
   NASA said effects of Santorini's blast were felt around the
world, and Thera's destruction is believed to be the source of
Plato's story of Atlantis, which tells of an island civilization
submerged by the sea after being shaken by earthquakes.
   ``Recent archaeological studies suggest that `Atlantis' may have
been Minoan centers on Crete, destroyed by tidal waves from the
Thera-Santorini eruption,'' Pang said.
   U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Bob Tilling called Pang's
study ``kind of neat. He has another line of evidence linking
climatic effects to that eruption. ... We need to get a better idea
of how often these large eruptions take place and whether there is
any pattern to them. That gives us a much better basis to forecast
possible future eruptions.''
   Pang said Santorini's eruption packed the punch of ``2 million
Hiroshima atomic bombs going off at the same time. Santorini was
roughly 100 times more powerful than Krakatau (Indonesia, 1883).
Mount St. Helens is a little bitty volcano compared with this.''
   Pang and NASA called the Thera-Santorini explosion the most
powerful volcano eruption in recorded history. Tilling said he was
unsure of the latest estimates, but ``it is clearly one of the
largest.''
   The volcano spewed sunlight-blocking debris and acid aerosols,
chilling Earth's climate to cause disturbances noted in historical
accounts of the reign of King Jie, the last king of the Xia
dynasty, which is China's earliest recorded dynasty.
   ``At the time of King Jie, the sun was dimmed,'' the annals say.
``Three suns appeared (due to ice crystals in the atmosphere
refracting the sun's image). ... Winter and summer came
irregularly. ... Frosts formed in the sixth month (July on the
Chinese calendar). ... The five cereals withered. ... Therefore
famine occurred. ... There was heavy rainfall and communities were
destroyed.''
   Cold wet summers also were observed following massive eruptions
of Indonesia's Tambora in 1815, Iceland's Laki in 1783 and another
Iceland volcano in 208 B.C., Pang said.
   After finding references to Santorini's climatic effects in the
Xia dynasty histories, Pang and his colleagues dated those
references using Shang Dynasty ``oracle bones'' _ genealogies
inscribed on tortoise shells and ox shoulder blades _ and Western
Zhou royal genealogies.
   The genealogies previously were dated by linking astronomical
events to the reigns of certain kings. In one case, Pang found a
historical account of a day that dawned twice that must have been
April 21, 899 B.C., when dawn was interrupted by a solar eclipse.
   Pang said previous studies used volcano-caused excesses of
sulfuric acid in ice cores from Greenland to estimate Thera erupted
happened between 1670 B.C. and 1620 B.C., compared with his date
range of 1630 B.C. to 1570 B.C. Stunted growth rings in Irish oak
trees and North American pines put it between 1613 B.C. and 1631
B.C.
   ``Some date it as late as the 14th century B.C. and some date it
as early as the 18th century B.C.,'' he said. ``Now all the methods
are converging on the late 17th century B.C.''
   Pang conducted the study with physicist Santosh Srivastava and
computer scientist Robert Keston of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and
Hung-hsiang Chou, an Asian languages professor at the University of
California, Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Battle Over Election of Georgia Judges Headed for Justice Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state attorney general plans to turn
documents over to the U.S. Justice Department for its investigation
of whether Georgia racially discriminates in the way it elects
judges.
   Attorney General Michael Bowers' decision came Tuesday, a day
after a three-judge federal panel in Savannah released a decision
ordering a federal review of 48 judgeships for racial
discrimination.
   Bowers has until Jan. 1 to submit information to federal
officials, who then would have 60 days to file objections to any of
the judgeships.
   Six of the state's 137 Superior Court judges are black. The
state's population is almost 30 percent black.
   The panel _ consisting of two U.S. District Court judges and one
federal appeals judge _ said Superior Court judges may complete
their terms but may not seek re-election until the state obtains
clearance of their posts.
   The panel also said the state may not fill five new judgeships
created this year until the Justice Department approves them.
   All 53 of the judgeships are scheduled to be filled by state
elections in 1990.
   At an Atlanta news conference, Bowers said he would comply with
the federal order but he wasn't ruling out the possibility of a
state appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The federal court ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the American
Civil Liberties Union; state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, a Fulton County
Democrat; and others who contend the state's judicial election laws
are discriminatory.
   Laughlin McDonald, an ACLU attorney handling the case, said he
was surprised the state did not maintain its hard-line defense.
   ``I'm glad they are going to submit the information to the
Justice Department,'' McDonald said. ``They should have done it a
long time ago.''
   The lawsuit contends 48 judgeships created since Nov. 1, 1964,
violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act because they were not
``pre-cleared'' by the Justice Department as the law requires. The
Justice Department did clear 29 other judgeships, finding no
discrimination.
   Superior Court judges are elected circuitwide by majority vote
to designated seats. The circuit sometimes covers several counties.
   Brooks wants judges to be elected in district elections, but
Bowers said such a practice would be the ``antithesis'' of
representative government because judges hear cases from all over a
circuit, not just an elected district.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II says the ecological crisis
is becoming a threat to world peace and can only be solved by
overcoming greed, consumerism and indifference to life.
   In his annual message for the Roman Catholic Church's World Day
of Peace, the pope said Tuesday that the destruction of the
environment is actually a moral issue.
   The pope said he wasn't asking that the modern world return to a
``paradise lost'' but for moderation, discipline and the spirit of
sacrifice.
   Threats to world peace, he said, come not only from the arms
race, regional conflicts and social injustice but also ``the
plundering of natural resources and by a progressive decline in the
quality of life.
   ``The sense of precariousness and insecurity that such a
situation engenders is a seabed for collective selfishness,
disregard for others and dishonesty,'' John Paul said in the
message, which is sent to world leaders.
   The pope chooses a different topic each year for the New Year's
message and used it to present some of his widest views to date on
the environment. Last year, he examined threats to peace from
ethnic disputes.
   John Paul spared neither industrialized nor developing societies
from criticism.
   ``It is manifestly unjust that a privileged few should continue
to accumulate excess goods, squandering available resources, while
masses of people are living in conditions of misery at the very
lowest level of subsistence,'' the pope said.
   But he said ``countries in the process of industrialization are
not morally free to repeat the errors made in the past by others,
and recklessly continue to damage the environment through
industrial pollutants, radical deforestration or unlimited
exploitation of non-renewable resources.''
   John Paul did not name any individual country. At a news
conference to present the message, a Vatican official, Monsignor
Jorge Maria Mejia, noted that the church in Italy, the Philippines,
Brazil and Indonesia has spoken out against destruction of forests.
   The pope condemned genetic manipulation, the ``unscrupulous''
development of new forms of plant and animal life and
``unacceptable experimentation'' on the origins of human life.
   He lamented that laboratory tests continue on new offensive
weapons capable of altering the balance of nature despite
international agreements prohibiting chemical, bacteriological and
biological warfare.
   The seriousness of the ecological crisis, he said, ``lays bare
the depth of man's moral crisis. If an appreciation of the value of
the human person and of human life is lacking, we will also lose
interest in others and the earth itself.''

   The wake-up call everybody had been
waiting for finally came. Hundreds of foreigners grabbed their
luggage, walked out of their hotels and boarded buses today to
escape the crossfire of a coup attempt.
   ``We were just dying to get out, we were afraid that if they
(the rebels) became desperate, they would get us,'' said Michelle
Nadela, 21, of Reno, Texas.
   A truce between mutinous soldiers who held Manila's Makati
financial district, where many hotels catering to foreigners are
located, allowed hundreds to finally flee what had become the heart
of the 5-day-old revolt.
   When the cease-fire went into effect, they were told to pack
their bags and board government buses.
   ``It was slick, it was a superb operation,'' said Crosby Nash,
58, of Centreville, Md.
   Throughout the morning, buses ferried hundreds of guests from
the hotels to a duty-free shopping center 20 minutes away next to
the international airport. About 300 people immediately hopped
aboard the first available flights out of the country.
   Among the people shuttled from the financial district by the
Department of Tourism, including residents of Makati apartments,
were at least 241 Americans. Natives of more than 40 other
countries, including Japan, Britain, Israel and even Peru, were
among the 1,800 people rescued.
   Officials said at least four foreigners remained in the area.
   The evacuees were happy to have left behind some harrowing
experiences.
   Briton Danny Chevin said he heard gunfire and saw tracers
Tuesday night coming from the roof of the Intercontinental Hotel,
just above the room where he was staying.
   ``I thought that if they (government troops) started firing
back, it would come right at our windows,'' said Chevin, of London.
   Chevin said he recorded the firefight on videotape, and other
guests also went away with Makati mementos.
   Marion Auspitz of New York, for example, picked up a bullet
found next door to her room in the Manila Peninsula.
   And Fanny Dickins, a British resident of Hong Kong, took a
picture with a rebel leader before boarding the evacuation bus from
the Intercontinental.
   ``I found them all sympathetic, they were very nice and
extremely polite, all of them,'' she said of the rebels.
   Indeed, many of the foreigners had nothing but praise for the
mutineers who occupied the hotels.
   ``They were being very professional about everything, they
didn't want to hurt us,'' said Chevin.
   ``They did not treat us at any time as hostages,'' added Ron
Kay, 39, of Atlanta.
   Thomas Adkins of San Diego said rebels even served a breakfast
of bacon and eggs to some of the Nikko Manila Garden hotel guests
Saturday morning.
   The Manila Garden was the first hotel evacuated, with the
management using the public address system at dawn to inform guests
of the impending move.
   The Intercontinental came next, followed by the Peninsula, where
guests had slept in the lobby. Guests at the hotels said
electricity, telephone and water service all had deteriorated by
early Wednesday.
   At the duty-free center, the United States and several other
countries set up reception desks and the government provided
assistance for transportation and hotel bookings.
   ``It feels good,'' said Kay as he nursed a cold San Miguel beer
next to a reception desk set up by the U.S. Embassy. ``I'm happy to
be out.''

<HEAD>President Promises More Democratic Reforms After Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui today promised more
democratic reforms after the ruling Nationalist Party's setback in
Taiwan's first multiparty elections, acknowledging a decline in his
party's credibility.
   The Nationalists suffered their worst losses in 40 years in
power in Saturday's balloting. The party lost several key local
county executive posts and garnered 58 percent of the total vote,
down from 70 percent in 1986.
   ``It was a setback for our party as far as our original goal was
concerned,'' said Lee, who also chairs the Nationalist Party.
   ``The decision made by the voters was not a coincidence,'' Lee
told the party's decision-making Central Standing Committee, ``It
indicates the various reform measures undertaken by the government
in recent years had failed to meet the public's expectations.''
   Opposition supporters, meanwhile, ended four days of massive
demonstrations against alleged vote fraud after a recounting of
ballots began at the heavily guarded Tainan District Court in
southern Taiwan.
   During the election and raucous campaign, the opposition party
accused the Nationalists of widespread vote buying and ballot box
stuffing.
   Lee said the government had failed to solve such problems as
worsening crime, social morale and ``the authorities' declining
credibility.''
   ``We must learn our lesson from the setback. We must not
hesitate any more,'' Lee said. ``We are more sure of our way and
will take faster and more positive steps'' toward various political
and other reforms.
   Lee has pushed for the retirement of hundreds of elderly members
who dominate the Legislature. They were elected on the Chinese
mainland before the Nationalists fled Taiwan in 1949 and were
frozen in office to support the Nationalists' claim to be the sole
legitimate ruler of all of China.
   Few have accepted handsome government pensions and filed for
retirement.
   Earlier in Tainan, about 2,000 noisy protesters occupied a
section of a freeway and stopped traffic for an hour as recounts
were stalled by the slow transportation of ballot boxes from eight
villages, police and witnesses said.
   Huang Chin-cheng, chief prosecutor of the Tainan District Court,
said the count would take three days because the process was going
to be monitored by campaign officers of both the opposition and
Nationalist candidates for the county executive post.
   The Nationalist candidate was initially declared the winner.
   On Tuesday, about 10,000 opposition supporters, screaming for a
recount, clashed with police who cordoned off a square next to
county government offices. Several were injured.
   Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Huang
Hsin-chieh went to Tainan and asked for a recount. The government
initially refused, fearing all other losing candidates would follow
suit.

   A beleaguered President Corazon
Aquino declared a state of national emergency today and pleaded
with fellow Filipinos to defy the hundreds of mutinous soldiers who
``want to kill me.''
   The declaration came after a cease-fire between rebel and
loyalist troops enabled about 1,800 foreigners, hundreds of them
Americans, to be evacuated from Manila's financial district, scene
of heavy fighting since Saturday.
   The rebels, angered at U.S. military support for Mrs. Aquino,
had on Tuesday threatened to prevent some Americans from leaving.
Today, they issued a veiled threat against those who remain in the
country.
   After the evacuation, rebel and military representatives then
opened talks for a peaceful settlement of the crisis.
   Mrs. Aquino had previously vowed not to negotiate, demanding
that the rebels ``surrender or die.'' She had also overruled
recommendations from Cabinet members two days ago to declare a
state of emergency.
   ``You, my beloved countrymen, I depend on you,'' the obviously
strained and fatigued Mrs. Aquino said on natonal television before
declaring the emergency. She appealed for a show of ``people
power'' in the streets on Friday similar to the 1986 demonstrations
that helped put her in office.
   The plea came five days after thousands of mutineers launched
the strongest attempt yet to topple Mrs. Aquino's administration,
which has been widely criticized as indecisive and inept.
   It was unclear what specific powers Mrs. Aquino would be able to
wield under the emergency declaration. Press Secretary Adolfo
Azcuna said the government planned to take over utilities and
transport but not the media.
   Sen. John Osmena said most of the 23 senators endorsed the move
and he expected Congress to grant Mrs. Aquino sweeping powers.
   But opposition Rep. Salvador Britannico said it would discourage
foreign investment and tourism: ``The opposition believes that it
is a first step...toward the declaration of martial law.''
   Cabinet officials said the declaration was not tantamount to
martial law and that there would be no curtailment of civil
liberties.
   ``This is not martial law,'' said Labor Secretary Franklin
Drilon. ``There's no curfew, there's no suspension of the writ of
habeas corpus. Congress will continue. We will continue to enjoy
our rights. It only empowers government to check those who may not
be delivering basic services.''
   The announcement came as estimated 400 rebel soldiers continued
to hold the Makati financial district and a similar number of
mutineers held an air base on Cebu Island about 350 miles south of
Manila.
   Opposition sources claim the rebels also have the support of
other units that have not moved overtly against the government.
   The insurrection, the sixth in Mrs. Aquino's nearly 4-year-old
government, has claimed the lives of at least 77 people and left
more than 540 wounded.
   On national television tonight, the president attempted to
rekindle the now-dormant ``people power'' that toppled Ferdinand
Marcos and propelled her into office with a plea for people to take
to the streets on Friday.
   She said the rebels wanted to dismantle democracy and return the
nation to the dark days of martial law, which Marcos imposed from
1972 until 1981.
   ``I am telling you now that I put so much at stake for
democracy,'' the president said, speaking extemporaneously.
   ``I have lost my husband. ... It is very clear that these people
want to kill me, want to eliminate me so that they can rule our
land,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain in
1983 moments after returning from the United States to challenge
Marcos for leadership.
   The rebels have demanded that she resign in favor of a coalition
to pave the way for a referendum on a new form of government. The
have accused her of ignoring corruption, refusing to intiate social
and economic reforms, and failing to crush the Communist insurgency.
   Early today, buses began transporting foreigners trapped in
hotels and condominiums in Makati, which the insurgents seized on
Saturday.
   U.S. Embassy and Philippine authorities said at least 241
Americans were among the foreigners taken out safely.
   During the evacuation, military chief of Staff Gen. Renato de
Villa designated Brig. Gen. Arturo Enrile, superintendent of the
Philippine Military Academy, to negotiate with the rebels in the
financial district.
   Sporadic sniping resumed, however, when the evacuation was
completed.
   More than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and a
shopping area near the airport, where evacuees were taken until
arrangements could be made for them to leave the country.
   ``It was slick,'' said Crosby Nash, 58, of Centreville, Md., of
the evacuation. He had been stranded at the Manila Garden Hotel.
``It was a superb operation. I think there's certainly relief.''
   A rebel officer had said trapped Americans might not go free
because, in a gesture of support for Mrs. Aquino, whose term
expires in June 1992. U.S. warplanes providing air cover for
loyalist forces early in the revolt.
   But a statement issued today said the insurgents' executive
committee decided late Tuesday to free all the Americans because
``these American tourists are not our enemy.''
   Later today, however, a statement issued in the name of a rebel
leader, Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, declared the insurgents were in
a ``state of war.''
   ``We advise the U.S. government to prepare a plan for the
evacuation of its nationals as the impotent Aquino administration
may not be able to ensure their safety,'' said the statement
distributed to news organizations.
   ``We appeal to the American people to exert pressure on the
United States government to refrain from pursuing any policy or
action which may trigger a new Philippine-American War.''

<HEAD>Attorney: Florida Woman Vindicated When Rapist Sentenced in Georgia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The attorney for a Florida woman who lost a rape
case because the jury said she ``asked for it'' says the woman is
vindicated now that her accused attacker has been sentenced to life
in prison in Georgia.
   But attorney Alexander Siegel said Steven Lamar Lord, who
pleaded guilty Tuesday to raping and kidnapping a Decatur woman,
was trying a foolish ploy when he told the judge his plea would
prevent the victim from reliving her trauma in court.
   ``That's like Attila the Hun saying he was sorry for trampling a
few thousand extra people,'' Siegel said in a telephone interview
from his Fort Lauderdale home.
   Superior Court Judge Hilton Fuller of DeKalb County sentenced
Lord, 26, to life in prison for the rape and a concurrent 20-year
sentence for kidnapping the woman at a 24-hour banking machine in
Decatur. In Georgia, those sentenced to life are eligible to be
considered for parole after seven years.
   Court records show that Lord had reportedly told the victim:
``It's your fault. You're wearing a skirt.''
   Lord's attorney, public defender Bill Hankins, told Fuller that
Lord ``regrets very much what has happened to her.''
   Lord was acquitted of rape in October in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
At that time, the jury foreman, Roy Diamond, said jurors believed
the woman accusing him, who was wearing a white lace miniskirt
without underwear when she was attacked, had ``asked for it.''
   Although Diamond later said he meant she asked for sex and not
rape, the acquittal sparked a national controversy.
   Other jurors then said they were swayed by the woman's calm
demeanor in court compared with the emotional testimony of the
24-year-old Decatur woman who testified in the Florida trial that
Lord raped her at knifepoint.
   ``When the Georgia woman testified, my heart sank,'' said juror
Dean Medeiros. ``But when the other one testified, she didn't
appear to be shaken up. Basically, we didn't believe her story.''
   Betty Grant, president of the Georgia chapter of the National
Organization for Women, said Tuesday night she was ``delighted''
that Lord was finally sentenced.
   ``There's no remorseful awareness here. I hope his sentence
sticks because we know rape offenders do repeat the crime,'' she
said.
   Siegel contended that Lord's guilty plea came because he heard
the Decatur woman's testimony before his hearing in Georgia.
   ``He knew he didn't stand a chance,'' the attorney said.
   Siegel said he had not been able to reach his client with the
news of Lord's plea because her phone was out of order. He said,
though, that she would be ``very relieved.''

   The evangelist who introduced Jim Bakker
to Jessica Hahn was charged along with a former PTL minister with
lying to a special grand jury.
   The federal grand jury on Tuesday charged evangelist John Wesley
Fletcher with one count of perjury for his testimony about how
Bakker was introduced to Ms. Hahn.
   According to the indictment, on Sept. 24, 1987, he denied taking
Miss Hahn to a Clearwater Beach, Fla., hotel to have sex with
Bakker. But, the indictment said, on Sept. 20, 1988, he testified
that he agreed when Bakker asked him, ``Get me a woman.''
   Sam Johnson, a former minister at PTL's Heritage Village Church,
was charged with 12 counts of perjury for his testimony before the
special grand jury. Johnson's testimony focused on a $10,000 loan
he made to former PTL Executive Vice President Richard Dortch that
later went to Ms. Hahn.
   The payment was made Nov. 1, 1984, before the former church
secretary received $265,000 in PTL funds in exchange for her
silence about her 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker in a Florida
motel room.
   ``We don't expect any further PTL-related indictments from this
grand jury,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, who
prosecuted Bakker. He wouldn't elaborate.
   The indictments were issued about three hours after Dortch,
Bakker's former second in command at PTL, testified to the federal
grand jury.
   Dortch, who pleaded guilty in August to fraud and conspiracy for
his role in the PTL affair, had no comment as he left the
courthouse.
   Late Tuesday, Dortch's attorneys filed a motion asking U.S.
District Judge Robert Potter to reduce Dortch's sentence because of
his cooperation with prosecutors.
   Dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined
$200,000. His plea agreement enables the former Assemblies of God
official to remain free until federal authorities no longer require
his cooperation.
   According to prosecutors, Dortch had one of his assistants
deliver $10,000 in an envelope to former PTL board member Aimee
Cortese, who handed over the money to Miss Hahn during a meeting at
a church in New York City in November 1984.
   During his two appearances before the special PTL grand jury,
Johnson said Dortch had asked him for a $10,000 loan, but Johnson
told the panel he could not remember where he got the money,
according to the indictment.
   Johnson could not be reached for comment Tuesday. His secretary,
Pam Jewett, said he was taping a Christmas TV special in the
mountains.
   Fletcher's number wasn't listed in the Durham telephone
directory, so attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year term in a federal prison in
Minnesota after being convicted Oct. 5 of fraud and conspiracy.
Bakker is appealing the conviction, but a panel of the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals refused to free Bakker on bond while the
appeal was prepared.
   Bakker was accused of bilking followers who sent him $158
million for partnerships in the ministry entitling them to annual
lodging guarantees. Prosecutors said Bakker diverted $3.7 million
in PTL money to buy expensive homes, cars, jewelry and vacations.

<HEAD>Former Unwed Mother Fighting For High School Honor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM STRADER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been six years since Arlene Pfeiffer
Kerner cheered at a football game or attended classes, but there's
a piece of her high school days she hasn't let go.
   She's still fighting to be reinstated in the National Honor
Society. She was thrown out of the organization as a senior after
she gave birth while unmarried, allegedly for not upholding
membership criteria of character and leadership.
   Now 23 and married, her case finally has reached a federal
courtroom in Pittsburgh. The non-jury trial opened Tuesday with her
taking the stand, claiming discrimination by Marion Center Area
School District officials.
   Mrs. Kerner said she kept up the fight ``because I thought I was
right.''
   ``As far as I was concerned,'' she said, ``I still had the
character and leadership that was necessary for membership, whether
I was a married mother or an unwed mother.''
   Mrs. Kerner sued in early 1984 in U.S. District Court to regain
her membership in the National Honor Society. The school district
is about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh.
   Mrs. Kerner said teachers told her the two weeks of classes she
missed after having her baby affected her leadership abilities. The
faculty took the action after giving her the opportunity to resign,
an option she refused.
   Mrs. Kerner testified honor society faculty advisers at her
school told her their decision ``would have been different'' if she
had been married. She said school officials refused to answer when
she asked them if she'd have been dismissed had she obtained an
abortion.
   In his opening statement to U.S. District Judge Barron McCune,
attorney Jay Y. Rubin said the school district treated his client
differently than it would have treated a male honor student. Rubin
tried to call as a witness a former Marion Center student who had
been allowed to remain a member of the National Honor Society even
though he got a girl pregnant.
   But McCune would not allow the man to testify, saying that case
occurred two years after Mrs. Kerner had been dismissed. The judge
said Mrs. Kerner's lawsuit might have affected the board's decision.
   Martha H. Munsch, the attorney for Marion Center schools,
attempted to show membership in the National Honor Society was not
important to Mrs. Kerner. Ms. Munsch questioned Mrs. Kerner about
missing an honor society function in favor of cheerleading practice.
   She said dismissal from the society did not prevent Mrs. Kerner
from attending college or receiving scholarships. Mrs. Kerner
testified she enrolled in college but withdrew after one day
because her child took up too much time. She also said she never
applied for scholarships or financial aid.

   Thieves would smell something other than
the sweet, pine aroma of Christmas if they were to take a tree from
this city's park.
   Their olfactory senses would sniff the odious odor of skunk.
   After several trees in a park were stolen during the Christmas
season two years ago, public works employees last year began
spraying the remaining trees with a special mixture of skunk oil
and fox urine, public works Director Ralph Dannenberg said Tuesday.
   The commercial product has an odor very much like a skunk's and
can last on cloth and carpeting for weeks, if not months,
Dannenberg said. The mixture is extremely potent in an enclosed
area, he said.
   ``You can't even smell it going on the trees, but once you bring
it inside a heated room, it does start to stink,'' he said. ``We
sprayed it on a bush and brought it in the office to test it out
and got the thing back outside in a hurry.''
   Since the spraying began, the city has had no reports of tree
thefts from parks during the Christmas season, he said.
   A company in Fort Collins, Colo., Rocky Mountain Wildlife
Services, said this week that it has begun marketing such a spray
to cemeteries, cities, ski areas, landscape companies and private
landowners.

<TEXT>
   A truck bomb exploded during rush hour
today in downtown Bogota, killing at least 23 people and injuring
about 1,000 near a building housing Colombia's federal police
force, reports said.
   Several stores were destroyed, and police appealed for anyone in
the area with picks and shovels to help search through rubble for
survivors. Cries for help could be heard beneath some of the ruins,
according to radio reports.
   The explosion left a crater 15 feet deep and 30 feet across, and
it damaged or dstroyed 60 cars. A car located 10 feet from the
bomb's crater had the roof flattened, and a body was hanging from a
window.
   The owner of a hardware store cried out in agony when he saw the
bodies of his wife and daughter brought out of the rubble. Only his
little girl's patent leather shoes were visible beneath the bloody
sheet covering her.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell
on drug traffickers who have repeatedly bombed the nation's city's
in an effort to stop the government from extraditing suspected
traffickers to the United States.
   The explosion occurred less than 24 hours after the government
said a bomb placed aboard a Colombian airliner had caused it to
crash shortly after takeoff from Bogota last month, killing all 107
people aboard. Authorities believe the drug traffickers also may
have been responsibile for that bomb.
   Also today, a reputed Colombian drug dealer who is a nephew of
one of the nation's drug kingpins was reportedly arrested in
Switzerland.
   The truck, which was rigged with dynamite, exploded in front of
the headquarters of the Department of Administrative Security,
Colombia's federal investigations police, the radio reports said.
   The bomb damaged the headquarters and several nearby stores. The
blast occurred at 7:30 a.m., after the headquarters had opened for
the day.
   An hour later, firefighters still were trying to control fires
amid the remains of stores, and columns of smoke rose over the
downtown area.
   The Colombian radio networks RCN and Caracol were reporting from
the scene of the bombing and quoted police officials there on the
number of fatalities.
   In a live broadcast interview with Caracol, Health Minister
Eduardo Diaz said about 1,000 people had been treated hospitals for
bomb blast injuries.
   The police department, known as the DAS, is where many
foreigners usually line up at this time of year to get
authorization to leave the country for Christmas vacations.
However, it was not known immediately if any foreigners were among
the victims of the explosion. The foreigners must get clearance
from th DAS, which determines whether they face any criminal
charges in Colombia.
   The building is near a plaza that is normally filled with fruit
and candy vendors in the morning and scores of people walking to
work.
   The goverment of President Virgilio Barco declared war on the
nation's cocaine cartels after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading
presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader, was assassinated on
Aug. 18. As part of the crackdown, the government has been
extraditing drug suspects wanted on charges in the United States.
   The drug traffickers have responded with a nationwide bombing
campaign. More than 200 attacks have killed 29 people and wounded
238.
   Hours after the report on the plane bombing Tuesday, a judge
investigating drug traffickers was assassinated, the fourth judge
killed in 15 weeks.
   Judge Bernardo Jaramillo Uribe was shot and killed while
strolling through Medellin, the base of the South American
country's largest cocaine cartel.
   In June, Jaramillo ordered destroyed 770 pounds of cocaine and
five drug processing laboratories seized by police in Segovia, 175
miles northwest of Bogota. He also looking into the massacre of 43
people in Segovia on Nov. 11, 1988. The government blamed a
paramilitary assassination team financed by drug traffickers.
   Authorities investigating the plane crash said that a bomb had
been placed inside the passenger area of Avianca Flight 203 that
exploded Nov. 27.
   Colombians reacted with shock and fear to the official report of
the airplane bombing, which caused the highest death toll from a
single attack in the wave of terrorism.
   In Lugano, Switzerland, police said today that Severo ``Junior''
Escobar, reputedly one of Columbia's leading drug barons, has been
arrested in southern Switzerland.
   A police spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed
reports in the French-language Tribune de Geneve that the
30-year-old nephew of Colombian kingpin, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, 39,
was arrested Nov. 29.
   The elder Escobar is considered one of the top 12 Colombian drug
dealers sought in the United States and has been indicted five
times in Florida and Louisiana and Colorado on a variety of drug
charges.
   The spokesman declined to give further details.

<HEAD>Marcos Jr. Says U.S. Aid to Aquino Could Mean War</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Philippines, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military support for forces loyal to
Philippines President Corazon Aquino could bring on a civil war,
said the son of that country's former leader.
   ``If the American government brings in firepower to support the
Aquino government, America will be at war with us,'' Ferdinand
Marcos Jr., told columnist Cindy Adams in an interview published
today in the New York Post.
   The United States provided air cover last Friday for the
Philippine military against mutinous soldiers.
   ``The logical extreme if pushed to the limits is America lands
forces and involves itself in our battle. Let there be no mistake.
America will find itself at war with the Philippines,'' he said in
New York.
   ``This is our fight,'' Marcos said. ``The man in the street has
intense resentment towards U.S. airplanes overflying him. It could
push what is now still considered an uprising into full-scale civil
war.
   ``If America comes in to mediate, OK. But, if America tries to
intervene between one group and another _ and, remember, the rebels
are loyal to the United States _ our country will kill the
Americans and each other and violence will escalate,'' he said.
   Mutinereers last week launched the strongest attempt yet to
topple Mrs. Aquino's administration, which has been widely
criticized as indecisive and inept. Mrs. Aquino took over after
Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in 1986.
   Although the Bush administration has defended Aquino as the
Philippines' democratically elected leader, the son of the late
Marcos insisted on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' today that the
anti-Aquino faction could be described as pro-American. ``It's been
quite ironic that the United States has used its military might
against them,'' he said.
   ``It was a dangerous precedent to begin with, which I think was
a serious mistake in judgment on America's part,'' Marcos said.
   ``It will be evident in years to come. The wave of
anti-Americanism that has derived from that move may be felt for
years to come,'' he said.

<HEAD>American Jewish Group Told Solution to Convent Problem Near</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction is expected to begin next
year on an ecumenical center to house nuns now living in a
controversial convent outside the Auschwitz concentration camp,
American Jewish leaders said today.
   Robert K. Lifton, president of the American Jewish Congress, and
Henry Siegman, its executive director, said their discussions this
week with Roman Catholic primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp and the
Krakow archbishop, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, showed a firm
commitment to complete the center.
   ``The decision to proceed was irreversible,'' Siegman said at a
news conference held at the offices of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki after the delegation met with Mazowiecki.
   The group said it has designated a Polish citizen to act as its
permanent representative to maintain relations between Poland and
the Jewish community in the United States. They said he would be
the first ``permanent link'' between American Jews and Poles in
Poland since the outbreak of World War II.
   The delegation agreed with the Roman Catholic Church leaders to
help formulate ``programs that will educate Catholics about Jews on
the local parish level.''
   Lifton said the delegation from the New York-based American
Jewish Congress delegation came to Poland to acquaint itself with
the dramatic political changes in the country under its new
Solidarity-led government and to talk about relations between Jews
and Polish Catholics.
   Besides meeting Mazowiecki, Glemp and Macharski, they had talks
with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz.
   Polish-Jewish relations were strained this year when the Roman
Catholic Church indicated it would renege on a 1987 promise to move
the convent housing 14 Carmelite nuns from just outside the
Auschwitz fence to the proposed ecumenical center for prayer and
education.
   A small group of American Jews led by Rabbi Avi Weiss entered
the convent grounds as a protest and were removed by construction
workers. A subsequent sermon by Glemp was viewed by many Jews as
containing anti-Semitic language.
   But in recent months a Vatican statement upholding the agreement
to move the nuns and conciliatory talks between Glemp and Jewish
leaders in London appear to have repaired most of the damage from
the incidents. Lifton stressed the need to improve future relations
instead of dwelling on past injuries.
   Lifton and Siegman were critical of Weiss, and Siegman said his
actions had caused ``terrible damages to all of the objectives
close to the American Jewish community and the state of Israel, not
to mention the local Jewish community.''
   They said it was important for Poles to understand that Weiss
was acting only on his own account and was not representing ``any
important segment of the American Jewish community.''
   ``In a democratic society, people at the margin can never be
controlled in what they say or do. All you can do is make sure they
remain at the margins,'' said Siegman.
   The Jewish leaders gave the new Solidarity government high marks
for its commitment to fight anti-Semitism in Poland, where only a
few thousand Jews remain from a pre-war community of about 3.5
million, and its efforts to democratize Polish society and address
its economic problems.
   Poland's new leaders ``are clear about their desire to relegate
anti-Semitism to the margins of Polish society,'' said Siegman.
   ``We have to recognize the mistakes of the past, and the harm
and pain they have caused, learn from them, and then move
forward,'' said Lifton.

<HEAD>Mother: `Feeling Good' After Donating Liver Part to Baby Girl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was more painful than she expected, but the
woman who gave up part of her liver for her baby girl in the
nation's first living donor liver transplant says she would do it
again.
   ``I feel real good,'' Teresa Smith said Tuesday during her first
public appearance since she and her daughter, Alyssa, underwent
surgery Nov. 27.
   ``I don't feel like a `first,''' she said. ``I feel like any
parent who is looking out for the best interests of her child.''
   ``There was a little more pain than I expected,'' added Mrs.
Smith, 29. ``But this was our best option for Alyssa.''
   Alyssa suffered from biliary atresia, an often-fatal congenital
liver disorder.
   Alyssa remained in serious but stable condition at University of
Chicago Hospitals. ``She still has a lot of hurdles to cross,'' but
the piece of liver transplanted from her mother has shown no signs
of rejection, said Dr. Peter Whitington, director of pediatric
services at the hospital.
   Mrs. Smith told reporters she'd seen her 21-month-old daughter
several times since the weekend, when she had recovered enough to
visit Alyssa for the first time since the operation.
   Much of their time together has been spent sharing books and
getting Alyssa to play with her toys, said the fourth-grade teacher
from Schertz, Texas, near San Antonio.
   Mrs. Smith will be discharged before the weekend, said
Whitington.
   There is a 50 percent chance Alyssa will be released in time for
Christmas, although she will have to remain near the hospital for a
time, he said.
   ``The liver is still not functioning perfectly,'' Whitington
said. ``Right now, she's a little yellow. But all other functions
have pretty much fallen into place.''
   Another pioneering transplant patient, a woman who was given a
heart, liver and kidney, has been upgraded to serious condition and
taken off a ventilator three days after her historic surgery.
   Doctors said Cindy Martin, 26, of Archbald, Pa., was responding
well following the 21{-hour operation that began Saturday at
Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   The next living donor transplant candidate probably will arrive
in Chicago in January, Whitington said, and as many as eight of the
operations could be performed through February.
   The second child scheduled for the procedure probably will not
have the operation. Sixteen-month-old Sarina Jones of Millington,
Tenn., near Memphis, who arrived at the hospital Friday, is too ill
to be a good candidate for the operation, Whitington said.
   ``She is every bit as malnourished as an Ethiopian refugee,'' he
said. ``She's a worse physical candidate than she was'' when
doctors first examined her last Friday.
   If she recovers, doctors probably will use a cadaver liver if
one becomes available, Whitington said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Frees Lawyers Ordered to Testify</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered five Dallas and Tulsa
lawyers to jail because they refused to testify about the source of
fees they received in a 1987 drug case, but a federal appeals court
temporarily halted the order.
   A hearing before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
   The lawyers refused to testify Tuesday before a federal grand
jury about fees they received for defending methamphetamine makers
convicted on drug charges in federal court in Muskogee.
   U.S. District Judge James O. Ellison ordered the lawyers jailed
for contempt. Hours later, after an emergency session, the U.S.
Circuit Court in Denver stayed the contempt citations and ordered
the men freed on their own recognizance until an appeal could be
heard.
   The men claim fee information is a privileged communication
between attorney and client. Ellison disagreed.
   ``The attorney-client privilege shields only those
communications made for the purpose of securing legal advice,''
Ellison wrote in the court order. ``Matters involving the payment
of fees and the identity of clients are not generally privileged.''
   The federal government is investigating Dallas nightclub owner
James Coltharp's alleged connection to the methamphetamine lab in
Beggs, about 30 miles south of Tulsa. Federal prosecutors allege
Coltharp may have paid the attorneys' fees for the convicted lab
crew.
   The lawyers are Stanley Monroe and John Echols of Tulsa, and
Scott Anderson, James Walker and Tex McConathy of Dallas. None is
accused of any impropriety and none is the target of the grand jury
inquiry, U.S. Attorney Tony M. Graham said.
   In his court order, Ellison said the fact that the men are not
the target of the investigation means they cannot claim protection
under the Fifth Amendment.
   ``Nothing in the circumstances before this court demonstrates
that compliance with the subpoenas as to the payment of fees ...
would in any way convey the substance of any confidential
communication,'' Ellison wrote.

   The fate of a Hispanic policeman accused of
manslaughter in the shooting of a black motorcyclist was in the
hands of the jury today, almost 11 months after the killing sparked
three days of race riots.
   The multi-ethnic jury _ two blacks, one Hispanic and three
non-Hispanic whites _ began deliberations today after almost seven
weeks of jury selection and testimony closely followed by the
city's residents.
   Deliberations began at 9:50 a.m. after the jury received
last-minute instructions from Dade County Circuit Judge Joseph
Farina.
   Colombian-born Officer William Lozano, 31, faces two counts of
manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist, Clement Lloyd, 23,
and his passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24.
   Police and community relations officials have geared up for
possible renewed rioting if Lozano is acquitted. However, they said
the presence of two blacks on the jury _ along with extensive live
broadcasts of testimony and arguments _ may have defused tensions
in neighborhoods that have exploded four times this decade after
police violence against blacks.
   During final arguments, prosecutors said Lozano had no excuse
for shooting Lloyd as the bike sped up an Overtown street while
fleeing a squad car.
   ``It's real hard to believe a police officer could do something
so stupid,'' Chief Assistant State Attorney John Hogan said. ``That
this man, on January 16th, intentionally pulled the trigger and
wiped out two human beings.''
   Defense attorney Roy Black countered by accusing the state of
trying to make Lozano a scapegoat to ease racial tensions.
   ``He's sort of like a pawn caught up in forces beyond his
control,'' Black said.
   Black said defense testimony showed Lozano was about to be run
down by the motorcycle when he fired.
   ``This man discharged his gun for one reason only _ because he
thought he was going to be run over, because he thought he was
going to be killed.''
   If convicted, Lozano could be sentenced to a maximum 30 years on
each manslaughter count.
   Jurors heard from almost 60 witnesses after testimony began Nov.
15. The trial opened Oct. 23, but it took more than three weeks to
seat a jury.
   The shooting occurred on Martin Luther King's birthday as Miami
began a week of celebration leading up to the Super Bowl.
   Within an hour after the shooting, a mob gathered at the scene
in the predominantly black Overtown neighborhood and began pelting
officers with rocks and bottles.
   By the time the violence ended three days later, one looter had
been shot to death, 11 people were wounded by gunfire and 13
buildings were burned down in the Overtown and Liberty City
neighborhoods.
   It was the fourth such riot in Miami in the 1980s. The first
occurred in 1980 after an all-white jury in Tampa acquitted a group
of Metro-Dade policemen accused of beating black insurance
executive Arthur McDuffie to death.
   In 1982, a riot broke out when Miami officer Luis Alvarez
entered an Overtown video arcade and shot and killed Nevell
Johnson, who was black. Two years later, violence broke out again
when Alvarez was acquitted by an all-white jury.

<HEAD>Businessmen To Give $6 Million to High School for College Scholarships</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five businessmen say they are establishing
a $6 million college scholarship fund for graduates of the
200-student Winona Cotter High School, a private Roman Catholic
school.
   ``We wanted to motivate students to try to use more of the
potential we think they all have,'' said one of the businessmen,
Robert Kierlin, a Cotter graduate and president of Winona's
Fastenal Corp.
   ``One of my pet theories as I've gotten older is that no one
performs to 100 percent of their ability,'' Kierlin said. ``It
would be really great if some of the Cotter students got a better
chance to go to a little bit better college than they might
otherwise aspire to.''
   The businessmen also are giving $2 million for construction of
an indoor athletic facility for the school in southeastern
Minnesota. The gifts come one year after they gave more than $5
million for teachers' salaries and other expenses.
   The latest gift means that all current and future Cotter
students could receive money for part or all of their college
expenses.
   The scholarship fund was in part a reaction to a teacher's
observation that many of her students worked after school, said
Kierlin, who with four Fastenal founders arranged for the gift from
the proceeds of a recent stock sale.
   ``We believe in the work ethic, too, but not necessarily during
the school year,'' Kierlin said.

   Educators and philanthropy watchers said the gifts would be
remarkable for U.S. colleges, and is unheard of for a high school.
   ``Eight million dollars is extraordinary, astounding,'' said
Charles Pinto, high school consultant for the Archdiocese of
Chicago, which runs the largest private school system in the

   ``But what's important is that the money is not being given just
to the school, but to students,'' Pinto said.

   City Council has approved legislation to protect
the health and safety of more than 12,000 city workers who use
video display terminals.
   The bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law
of its kind in a major city, according to the New York City Video
Display Terminal Coalition of labor unions and occupational safety
and health groups.
   The bill, approved Tuesday, mandates that VDT operators at city
agencies be given a 15-minute break whenever they are required to
work at a terminal for more than two consecutive hours.
   Under the law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions _
including pregnancy _ would be allowed to obtain transfers. Some
studies have suggested prolonged VDT exposure increases risk of
miscarriage.
   The bill also mandates that lighting and furniture be adjusted
to prevent eye strain and repetitive strain injury to hands and
other parts of the body affected by prolonged VDT use.
   ``We hope New York City's legislation will set a national
precedent for protecting these workers not only from repetitive
strain injuries, but from eye strain, headaches, blurred vision,
and for pregnant women, from hazards that may lead to
miscarriage,'' said Diane Stein, coordinator of the VDT Coalition.

   A unmanned module docked with the Mir space
station today, bringing the cosmonauts a ``space motorcycle'' that
will allow them to work outside the station in greater safety and
comfort.
   Problems with a guidance system had prevented the 40-ton Kvant 2
module from docking as scheduled on Saturday, but the Tass dispatch
announcing today's docking did not say how that difficulty had been
overcome.
   One of two panels of a solar battery on board the Kvant 2 would
not open shortly after takeoff, but Tass said scientists solved
that problem later.
   The ``space motorcycle'' looks like a floating armchair and was
designed for use in repairing satellites and rescuing cosmonauts in
distress.
   The module also carries a shower and sink and an incubator in
which quail eggs are to be hatched to study the effects of
weightlessness on heredity.
   Cosmonauts Alexander S. Viktorenko, 42, and Alexander A.
Serebrov, 45, the latest Mir crew, have been aboard the space
station for three months.

   A Roman Catholic lay missionary accused of
involvement with Salvadoran guerrillas is back in the United States
after spending the weekend in custody.
   Scott Wright, 38, of San Antonio, was released Monday by
authorities in San Salvador on the condition that he leave the
country. He arrived in San Antonio on Tuesday.
   Wright said he was taken into custody with a Spanish priest and
three Salvadoran lay workers last Friday when uniformed police came
to the parish hall where they were working.
   ``They searched for two hours. They found nothing but some
papers and a few religious relics,'' he said. ``No one ever told us
why it was being searched or why we were being detained.''
   He and the priest were separated from the Salvadorans.
   ``Even handcuffed, blindfolded and made to stand like that for
hours, I believe we received preferential treatment,'' he said with
a wry smile.
   Wright, who spent most of the last three years in El Salvador,
said the Salvadoran government is increasing reprisals against
church workers because they witnessed the effects of recent bombing
in the capital city on civilians and because officials insist they
are aiding the enemy.
   ``The government basically has accused these parishes of
collaborating with the guerrillas. I think that's a false
accusation,'' Wright said. ``The church has opened its doors to
refugees, it has treated the wounded, it's continued to feed the
people, the children, that is its mission.''

<TEXT>
   A leading drug trafficker in Europe
whose uncle helps run the Medellin cartel in Colombia has been
arrested in a raid on a luxury hotel in southern Switzerland,
police said today.
   A police spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed
reports in the French-language Tribune de Geneve that Severo
``Junior'' Escobar, 30, was arrested Nov. 29. The spokesman refused
to give further details.
   A Justice Ministry spokeswoman, Ursula Riedel, said Swiss
authorities had not received any extradition requests for Escobar,
described by news reports as the top Colombian drug trafficker in
Europe and No. 6 in the international cocaine mafia hierarchy. He
is said to be the nephew of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the reputed head
of Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The elder Escobar is one of the top 12 Colombian drug dealers
sought in the United States and has been indicted five times in
Florida and Louisiana and Colorado on a variety of drug charges.
   The younger Escobar's father, also named Severo Sr., was
convicted of drug charges in the United States in 1984 and
sentenced to 30 years in prison.
   Police arrested the younger Escobar and four Colombian
companions in a raid on a luxury hotel in the Swiss-Italian border
town of Lugano, where the group had been staying for two months,
the Tribune de Geneve reported.
   The newspaper said police seized seven pounds of pure cocaine,
which the men allegedly had received as a sample prior to the
planned delivery of 440 pounds of the drug destined for the Swiss
and Italian markets.
   The arrests followed months of investigations in Switzerland,
Spain, the Netherlands and West Germany, the report said.
   The Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia said Escobar managed a
smuggling network that brought huge loads of cocaine to supply the
Swiss, German and Dutch markets. The Barcelona-based newspaper
described his capture as a major blow to the Medellin cartel's drug
trafficking network in Europe.

   The glamour is fading from the computer industry
at the close of the 1980s, tarnishing one of the most remarkable
success stories of American business.
   The computer industry has behaved more like the auto or steel
businesses this year, with numerous layoffs and other job
reductions. While sales continue to rise, the single-digit growth
is a comedown for an industry that was accustomed to bounding gains
early in the decade.
   The latest evidence came Tuesday, when International Business
Machines Corp., the world's biggest computer company, announced it
would cut 10,000 U.S. jobs without layoffs because of slow growth
in its home market.
   IBM and independent analysts cite several reasons, including an
economic slowdown and sluggish capital spending by American
companies.
   But one of the biggest factors is that computer makers have
worked their way out of sales. They have made machines so cheap and
powerful that customers no longer need to shell out millions of
dollars to get a job done. They can get by with spending a tenth or
a hundredth as much.
   There are some winners in this transformation: the makers of
personal computers and engineering ``workstations,'' such as Compaq
Computer Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc.
   The losers are companies that get most of their profit from
bigger, costlier computers, including IBM, Digital Equipment Corp.,
Unisys Corp., Control Data Corp., Amdahl Corp., Bull HN Information
Systems Inc., Wang Laboratories Inc. and Prime Computer Inc.
   All those companies have cut jobs this year, through layoffs or
voluntary resignations and retirements. Their machines can't match
personal computers for the combination of low price and high speed.
   Personal computers won't take over entirely. Big mainframe
computers remain irreplaceable for jobs such as controlling access
to vast reservoirs of data and handling complex computing jobs that
can't be split up among several smaller machines. Minicomputers,
which lie between mainframes and personal computers, also have a
valuable role in many corporations.
   But more and more, personal computers are doing jobs that once
were the exclusive reserve of bigger machines.
   ``The little guys are just creeping up everywhere and they're
stealing their way into niches all over the place,'' said Doug
Crook, a Dataquest Inc. analyst.
   All this is good for customers but bad for traditional computer
makers. IBM is a major factor in the personal computer market but
makes very thin profit margins in that business, in contrast to its
fat profits from its dominant market position in mainframe
computers.
   Digital Equipment is in a similar bind. This year, it introduced
a speedy computer workstation to compete with companies like Sun
Microsystems. The machine is so fast it threatens to cannibalize
Digital's own sales of its bread-and-butter Vax large-computer line.
   The danger to mainframes and minicomputers was obscured early in
the decade by the industry's overall growth. With expansion
slowing, the threat from personal computers is clearly delineated.
   IBM said Tuesday its business was stronger in Europe and Asia
than in the United States. One reason may be that personal
computers are not as popular abroad. Once PCs catch on abroad, they
may sap strength from those markets for bigger computers as they
did in this country, said Don Bellomy, an International Data Corp.
analyst.
   Bellomy's company is projecting an 8 percent increase in U.S.
sales of computers next year, about even with 7 percent this year
but far less than the 30 percent a year in 1982 through 1984.
   International Data projects the strongest growth in PCs and
workstations, 11 percent; and the weakest in mainframes, up less
than 1 percent.
   Cahners Publishing Co., which publishes several trade magazines,
is more pessimistic. It projects overall computer industry growth
of 2.7 percent this year and less than 2 percent in 1990.
   The scope of the difficulties is reflected in job figures.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer industry
employment in September was just under 420,000. While that is about
the same as the last few years, it is down sharply from 471,000 in
September 1984, the industry's last boom year.
   In its announcement Tuesday, IBM said that in addition to
cutting 10,000 jobs through retirement and separation incentives,
it would buy back $4 billion of its own stock.
   It also said it would set aside $2.3 billion from its pretax
profit to pay for the job cuts and related steps.

   The Supreme Court was urged today to permit
the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a Missouri woman
described as ``an unconscious shell.'' But a state lawyer said the
woman's parents have no constitutional right to order such action.
   William Colby, a lawyer representing the parents of Nancy
Cruzan, said if the permanently unconscious woman ``was lucid for a
moment and could come before this court,'' she would ask that a
tube in her stomach providing food and water be removed.
   ``Her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in
this case,'' Colby said. ``She would choose liberty.''
   But Assistant Attorney General Robert L. Presson of Missouri
said the parents have no constitutional right to precipitate their
daughter's death.
   ``In this extraordinary situation, the decision should be made
by a judicial body,'' Presson said, referring to a state court
ruling that the feeding tubes must be retained.
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the Bush administration's top
courtroom lawyer, supported Presson.
   Starr urged the court to give states ``wide latitude that
reflects reasonably the wishes'' of their citizens ``in this highly
sensitive and deeply vexing situation.''
   There is no constitutional right to choose to die in such cases
that overrides a state's determination to require continued food
and water for unconscious patients, Starr said.
   The justices, preparing for their first ``right-to-die''
decision, asked extensive questions of the lawyers.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked whether a lower court that
required the life-support treatment for Ms. Cruzan decided the case
based on ``the best interests of the patient?''
   ``I have been concerned because it's not clear what standard''
the lower court set, she said.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Colby, ``You presume there is a
liberty to die without clear and convincing evidence'' of the
patient's wishes.
   In his presentation to the justices, Colby said of Ms. Cruzan,
``She is an unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers for the
rest of her life.''
   Ms. Cruzan, 32, has been in what doctors call a persistent
vegetative state for almost seven years. Her parents, Joe and Joyce
Cruzan, are asing the court to let them order removal of a
surgically implanted tube providing her with food and water.
   The Missouri Supreme Court ruled doctors may not remove the tube.
   Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a Jan. 11, 1983, car
crash. She lies in a hospital bed, her body rigid, her hands and
feet constricted and bent into claw shapes. Doctors say she cannot
experience thoughts or emotions, and that her condition is
irreversible.
   But Ms. Cruzan can breathe on her own and has periods when her
eyes are open and move randomly.
   The surgically implanted tube could keep her alive for 30 years
or more, doctors say. Without it, she would soon die of starvation
or dehydration.
   Joe Cruzan, a sheet-metal worker, allowed doctors to implant the
tube four weeks after his daughter's accident. He said he was told
he could have it removed after a year if there were no improvement
in her condition.
   The right-to-die issue captured national headlines in 1976 when
the New Jersey Supreme Court allowed the family of Karen Ann
Quinlan to order removal of a respirator helping her breathe. Ms.
Quinlan, in a similar coma-like state, continued to be fed through
a tube and lived for nine more years.
   American courts since generally have permitted removal of
life-sustaining treatment for such patients, relying on a 1986
American Medical Association opinion that artificially supplied
nutrition and hydration are medical treatments.
   The AMA estimates 70 percent of Americans at some time will be
involved in a decision about whether to provide life-sustaining
medical care for themselves or family members.
   Forty-one states, including Missouri, have so-called living will
laws that allow people to pre-authorize the termination of
life-sustaining treatment. But Missouri's living-will law, which
does not allow for removal of feeding tubes, was not in effect when
Ms. Cruzan was injured.
   Her parents said she had told them she would not want to be kept
alive by artificial means if ever rendered incompetent.
   The Missouri Supreme Court said such statements fall well short
of the ``clear and convincing'' evidence needed to prove her real
intent.
   ``We choose to err on the side of life, respecting the rights of
incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a severely
diminished quality of life,'' the state court said.
   Even if the justices decide there is no constitutional right to
die, or that it cannot be exercised by a parent or guardian of an
incompetent person, states will remain free to let doctors remove
life-sustaining treatment from certain patients.
   But such a ruling might prompt lower courts to make it more
difficult for physicians and family members to terminate treatment.
   The Bush administration argues in a ``friend-of-the-court''
brief that even a competent adult does not have an unlimited right
to refuse food and water. Justice Department lawyers said states
have always prohibited attempted suicide, and noted some make it a
crime to help a suicide.
   The government said that even if a right to die exists, it does
not extend to an incompetent person and does not outweigh ``the
state's profound interest in preserving human life.''
   Anti-abortion groups also expressed support for the Missouri
court decision. It limits the privacy right that undergirds the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   Religious groups are split over the issue.
   The U.S. Catholic Conference and others say a victory for the
Cruzans could jeopardize the rights of the elderly or people with
severe handicaps.
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and others argue that
families should be free of unwarranted state intrusion when making
such decisions.
   The case is Cruzan vs. Missouri Department of Health, 88-1503.

   The Communist leadership will soon
present a new government that meets opposition demands for more
non-Communist members, the nation's top opposition leader said
today.
   Vaclav Havel said at a news conference that Communist Premier
Ladislav Adamec will present a list of names for the Cabinet to
leaders of the pro-democracy movement for approval before the list
is made public.
   He refused to disclose any details of the intense negotiations
to include more non-Communists, as demanded by the nation's
pro-democracy movement.
   Adamec told the state-run news agency CTK that he had accepted
from Civic Forum, the leading opposition group, a list of possible
Cabinet candidates.
   He said he will consult with other official political parties on
Thursday, then meet again with Civic Forum, probably on Friday, and
give them his proposals.
   It was not known whether either side had set special conditions
for the opposition to approve the Cabinet.
   The agreement on the new government represents the latest of
several dramatic concessions the Communists have made in the last
two months in the face of the growing pro-democracy movement. These
include a loosening of travel restrictions, the resignation of the
Communist leadership of Milos Jakes and the end of the Communists
constitutionally guaranteed hold on power.
   Havel spoke after holding his first talks with Communist Party
chief Karel Urbanek, who he said agreed with the opposition's
position that ``young, able people and experts who are not
discredited'' should be brought into the government.
   After his 75-minute meeting with Urbanek, Havel and other
opposition leaders met briefly with Adamec, who is trying to form a
new Cabinet after a coalition government he named Sunday ran into
fierce popular resistance.
   The opposition spurned that government because it brought in
just five non-Communists and left Communists in control of all key
ministries.
   The opposition has threatened a general strike on Monday if a
new federal government is not named by Sunday.
   Havel said Adamec will consult Thursday with representatives of
other, increasingly independent official parties on forming a new
government.
   The opposition will then learn the names of the new cabinet
Friday.
   Both the government and the opposition have refused to disclose
details of their negotiations. Opposition sources said the talks
envisage some form of power-sharing before the free elections the
opposition wants held by July.
   Havel, who only a month ago was a banned playwright reviled in
the official press, said Urbanek admitted during their
unprecedented meeting that his Communist Party faces ``deeply
rooted mistrust,'' and must change.
   But Urbanek told the opposition he has trouble convincing some
regional party leaders of this, Havel said. Havel said Urbanek
requested a second meeting Thursday with cameras from state-run
television present.
   The opposition leader did not say whether such a session would
take place, or whether it would be carried live on television.
   Urbanek also assured the opposition that the party's unpopular
paramilitary force, the People's Militia, has been completely
disarmed by the army and will probably be incorporated into the
armed forces.
   Urbanek also admitted that the Czechoslovak secret police ``has
lost all its purpose for internal matters,'' Havel said. He did not
elaborate.
   As the talks between Urbanek and Havel broke up, the Communist
Party chief could be heard telling actor Milan Knazko, an
opposition leader in Slovakia, ``the most important thing now is to
calm people's emotions so that we don't have a food rationing
system tomorrow.''
   This appeared to be a reference to the possibility of economic
chaos if the political crisis is not resolved soon.
   The opposition scored a victory Tuesday when a parliamentary
commission named Jakes and former Prague Communist boss Miroslav
Stepan as politically responsible for a police crackdown on
peaceful students Nov. 17.
   The commission recommended that both men be stripped of their
last political posts as parliamentary deputies.
   But the state-run news agency CTK quoted Jakes as saying today:
``I fully reject political responsibility for the events of Nov.
17, 1989, because the political decision was not to act against the
participants of the demonstration. Any other statement is not true
and is guided by political ambitions.''
   That crackdown spurred a week of enormous unrest that culminated
in the ouster of Jakes and some of his allies.
   The naming of politicians and police held responsible for the
crackdown was a chief demand of the striking students who started
Czechoslovakia's massive pro-democracy movement rolling just two
weeks ago.
   Also on Tuesday, a cabinet was named to rule the Czech region of
the country that left Communists in the minority for the first time
since 1948.
   This could serve as a model for a new federal government to
replace the 21-member federal Cabinet named on Sunday. That
government brought in just five non-Communists and left Communists
in control of all key ministries.
   The opposition has threatened a general strike on Monday if a
new federal government is not named by the weekend.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh overruled a
staff recommendation when he ordered a preliminary inquiry into
allegations of wrongdoing against former Housing Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr., a spokesman said today.
   The Justice Department's public integrity section recommended
against considering whether an independent counsel should
investigate the allegations of political favoritism and perjury
against Pierce, said spokesman David Runkel.
   ``That decision was reversed by the attorney general after his
further personal review,'' said Runkel, confirming an account in
The Washington Post.
   Runkel dismissed suggestions that Thornburgh ordered the
additional inquiry to avoid charges from Congress that he had
scuttled an investigation of a man with whom he sat in President
Reagan's Cabinet.
   ``He was concerned that the issues reviewed needed further
investigation,'' the spokesman said. ``He wasn't convinced by the
public integrity section's point of view.''
   Thornburgh's decision, made last Saturday, triggered a 60-day
preliminary inquiry to determine if he should seek court
appointment of an independent counsel, formerly known as a special
prosecutor, to conduct a full criminal investigation.
   Democratic congressmen alleged last month that Pierce awarded
Department of Housing and Urban Development grants on the basis of
political favoritism and lied under oath during congressional
hearings last spring.
   They cited testimony Pierce gave to the House Government
Operations employment and housing subcommittee that he did not have
``hands-on'' involvement in the award of HUD grants to politically
connected developers.
   The 19 lawmakers, all members of the House Judiciary Committee,
triggered procedures under the independent counsel law by
forwarding their allegations to Thornburgh.
   In response to the lawmakers' request, Thornburgh disclosed
Monday that he had ordered the preliminary inquiry.
   Pierce has denied any wrongdoing but twice refused to give
additional testimony to the House subcommittee, citing his
constitutional right against self-incrimination.
   Pierce's lawyers have contended that the lawmakers had not
provided the Justice Department with any ``specific and credible''
evidence that their client committed a crime.
   The public integrity section, applying that standard as outlined
in the independent counsel law, apparently agreed with that view.
   Earlier this week, Pierce's lawyers expressed confidence that
the preliminary inquiry would not result in the appointment of an
independent counsel.

   The Miami Herald on the Malta summit:
   President Bush's summation of his Malta meeting with Soviet
President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev was right on the mark. ``I
couldn't have asked,'' he said, ``for a better result from this
nonsummit summit.'' Nor could anyone.
   Their eight hours of talks did not resolve all the issues that
separate the United States and the Soviet Union. Nobody expected
them to.
   It was hoped, though, that the Malta talks would establish a
tone for future relations between the two leaders, articulate some
generalized expectations, and set forth specific areas on which
substantive formal agreements might be signed at their summit in
Washington next June.
   All three objectives were met in full.

   Orange County (Calif.) Register on Chinese student visas:
   (President Bush's) decision to veto a bill that would guarantee
visa extensions to 60,000 Chinese students in the United States was
a betrayal of our deepest values. ...
   The Chinese student leaders who pleaded publicy with President
Bush ... to sign this bill took a risk few Americans would
understand. Since the violent crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in Tienanmen Square, the Chinese government has monitored
news reports worldwide to identify dissenters. ...
   Leaders of the Tienanmen Square demonstrations still in China
are now being punished for their presumption. The luckiest have
only been run out of school, and face a life of slave labor. Many
have been arrested and tortured; some have been shot.
   The Chinese Immigration Act, passed overwhelmingly by Congress,
would have given the Chinese students nothing but time _ no money,
no special benefits, just a four-year visa extension. ...
   Perhaps during that time the freedom movement in China would
make enough progress that it would be safe to return. ...
   The president said the bill was unnecessary because he plans to
offer the same provisions through administrative rather than

claim they weren't influenced by the fact, but the Chinese
government was livid about the bill and threatened to cancel
student-exchange programs. ...
   By caving in to Beijing's whims, the administration sends a
message that the United States is so eager to restore relations on
cozy, pre-massacre terms that it will hold hostage these brave
students who represent the best hope that democracy may someday be
possible in mainland China. ...
   President Bush has demonstrated that his sympathies lie more
with China's dictators than with her freedom fighters. ... He

   Philadelphia Daily News on the auto industry:
   In case you've been wondering why the American automobile
industry has gone over the edge despite the best efforts of great
businessmen like Lee Iacocca, ... the Washington Post ...
pinpointed the reason.
   It's not the American autoworker, maligned over the past several
years as overpaid, unproductive and all kinds of other slanders.
Nope. American autoworkers are making cars so well there are lines
forming for them all over Japan, where automobile quality is almost
a cult.
   The trouble is somewhere else altogether. The trouble starts
with the very same people whining about unfair competition and
about those allegedly lax American workers. The trouble is the
imbeciles who run American automobile companies, the guys who beg
government bailouts and mourn the passing of the tailfin.
   Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi all have plants here. Those
plants are full of American workers making cars.
   Back home in Japan, people actually want those cars. Many of
them actually prefer those cars. So there are plans to ship at
least 163,000 cars to Japan annually in a couple of years. U.S.
workers are making Japanese cars to ship to Japanese buyers.
   That doesn't sound like the problem is U.S. workers.
   Sounds like the problem is U.S. managers. Too bad we can't
export them to Japan.

   Lawrence (Kan.) Journal-World on older workers:
   It's good to see that older workers are getting some of the
respect they deserve from employers.
   A survey released ... by the American Association of Retired
Persons shows that employers have raised their opinion of older
workers since the last AARP survey was taken four years ago.
   They were particularly impressed with the work ethic displayed
by older workers, their ability to handle pressure situations and
the experience they bring to the job.
   Older workers are often some of the most pleasant and useful
employees to be found in businesses. It's good to see that firms
are appreciating the jobs they do.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on postal delivery service:
   Anytime the U.S. Postal Service surveys customers or takes other
steps supposedly designed to improve service, we can't help but
fear that service is about to get worse or that another rate hike
is coming.
   Well, the U.S. Postal Service is at it again. And we're worried.
   More than a year ago, the Postal Service started what Sioux
Falls Postmaster Thomas Skolak has described in letters as a major
review of customers' needs for postal products and services.
   No rate hike is involved. But delivery service is likely to
change.
   Beginning next spring, some letters that may have reached their
destination in two days may take three days. Meanwhile, letters
that are only supposed to take one day or two days to deliver
should meet deadlines with greater regularity. ...
   Consider us cynical, if you want. But we're still uneasy. The
use of a survey smacks of a ploy to justify reduced delivery
standards.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Five Suspected Members of Right-Wing Hit Squad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today confirmed the
arrest of five suspected members of a rightist group that had
planned bombings and other terrorist acts.
   Human rights activists expressed concern that the arrests might
be part of an attempt to divert attention from recent allegations
of death squads within the ranks of the national police force.
   Max Coleman of the Human Rights Commission, a private group led
by anti-apartheid activists, said the government might try to
convey the impression that fanatical right-wingers, rather than
elements of the security forces, were the main culprits in a series
of unsolved attacks on government opponents.
   Police said the five men were arrested Tuesday in the
Johannesburg area and that they ranged in age from 28 to 40. Police
refused to disclose their names, saying that could jeopardize the
prospects for further arrests.
   They said a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives
was seized during the investigation.
   A police statement said the men were being held for questioning
about various bombings and other terrorists acts involving a
right-wing group but gave no further details.
   Local newspapers quoted unidentified police sources as saying
the men apparently belonged to a group that had broken away from
the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
 s the pear-shaped stringed instrument to promote Arabic
music around the world, and to bridge a culture gap. But he
believes that one of his biggest tasks in life is to instill a love
of Arabic music among youngsters who have been seduced by Western
rock and disco music and preserve a rich artistic heritage.
   ``It's a shame,'' he said in an interview. ``We have such great
music, but the younger generations never heed it.''
   Bashir, a native of Mosul in northern Iraq, said that for Arabs
to neglect their traditional music is to ignore an important aspect
of their cultural identity.
   ``Music is part of the cultural identity of any people. It's not
something you can borrow from others,'' he said. ``Music is not
just entertainment. It's a source of spiritual and moral
uplifting.''
   Bashir, 59, believes Arabic music is now in a state of crisis,
which he attributes to ``cultural backwardness.''
   As director of musical affairs at the Culture Ministry in
Baghdad, he has devoted 16 years to promoting Arabic music as part
of Iraq's educational system and culture.
   Bashire established a ballet and music school for children to
study and learn to play instruments and the Iraqi Institute of
Melody Studies for teen-agers.
   Three years ago, he formed the al-Bayariq ensemble, a 28-member
youth group, to develop young people's interest in authentic Arabic
music and to help preserve centuries-old songs that have begun to
disappear because of the ``ugly thrust'' of modern music. It is led
by his youngest son, Omer, 20.
   ``It's not just a source of pride, but an investment in our
cultural future,'' Bashir said. ``If we don't encourage young
people to play these instruments, our traditional music will die
and these instruments will only be found in museums.''
   Al-Bayariq brings together the oud, qanun, santur and joza, all
stringed instrumemnts, as well as the tablah, a small drum, and the
riqq, a frame drum with jingles akin to a tambourine.
   The oud is a six-stringed instrument, shaped like a lute. Bashir
believes the oud originated in Iraq. The instrument has been seen
on stone carvings dating back 2,000 years. From Arabia, the oud
made its way to Europe, possibly in the Moorish conquest of Spain,
and from it evolved the lute.
   The qanun is a zither-like instrument. The violin-like joza has
only one string that gives a strong, high pitch. It is played
resting on the leg rather than nestling under the chin. The santure
is something like a qanun, but its strings are played with sticks
rather than a bow.
   The instruments used by the ensemble are specially made for the
group by elderly craftsmen in a workshop set up by Bashir.
   The ensemble has performed in several foreign countries,
including France, and all over the Arab world. In Paris, the
youngsters performed at the Arab World Institute to standing
ovations.
   ``Now we've built a solid base, I hope these kids will stick to
their instruments, pioneering the way for others to follow,''
Bashir said.
   Arabic music has largely been ignored in the West because of its
complex melodies and ornamental flourishes that make it difficult
to grasp. But artists such as Bashir are increasingly bridging the
cultural gap.
   Critics hail him as a creative and supreme master of his
instrument, whose music springs from the authentic tradition of
Arabian music. Foreign critics say Bashir is notable for being able
to project the emotions of Arabic music, often lost to the
occidential ear, to non-Arabs.
   ``He stretches the understanding of music to the limit,'' one
European critic wrote. ``To listen to him takes as much
intellectual energy and attention as listening to the discourse of
a sage.''
   His playing is rooted in classical Arab forms but is largely
improvisational. Some critics have found it resembles progressive
jazz in many ways.
   Bashir has elevated the oud to solo instrument status after
centuries of having been used to accompany Arab singers. For one
thing, he added six more strings, pairing them with the others, to
produce a fuller sound and melodic flexibility.
   He discovered his gift for music when he was 6 years old while
listening to his mother singing lullabies to his younger brothers.
She also played several traditional instruments.
   ``She was my first idol. She breathed the love of music into
me,'' he said.
   His father made ouds and Bashir's brother also plays the
instrument.
   In his ministry office, crowded with musical instruments,
records and tapes, he spends two to three hours a day playing. No
one is allowed to interrupt him.
   ``All telephone calls and appointments have to be put off when
al-istath (the master) is playing, until he finishes his solo
performance in his office,'' said his secretary, Nizar Jawad, who
is also a lyricist and musician.

<HEAD>Administrator Gets 18 Months in Prison for University Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former University of Minnesota
administrator was sentenced today to 18 months in state prison for
stealing $186,000 from the university's Office of Minority and
Special Student Affairs.
   Luther Darville was convicted last month of three felony counts
of theft by swindle.
   He said all the missing money was doled out to needy athletes
and other students on instructions from his superiors, who
testified they had no knowledge of the payments.
   Hennepin County District Judge Patrick Fitzgerald sentenced him
to 18 months in prison on one count, 15 months on the second count
and one year and one day on the third count, to run concurrently,
said the judge's law clerk, John Conley. Darville will get credit
for time already served, nearly four months, Conley said.
   In addition, Fitzgerald sentenced Darville to six months at the
county workhouse for contempt of court, to be served after the
prison sentence.
   ``The position of trust that Mr. Darville had at the University
of Minnesota was violated,'' he said. ``The offenses were committed
with a high degree of planning over an extended and lengthy period
of time.''
   Prosecutor Pete Connors had sought a minimum sentence of 54
months, saying Darville had deceived the very students he was
supposed to be counseling and had made false allegations against
his colleagues.
   Defense attorney James Lawton argued for leniency, noting that
Darville has no previous criminal record and will be deported to
his native Bahamas.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer on the Exxon Valdez captain:
   Attorneys for Joseph J. Hazelwood, skipper of the ill-fated
Exxon Valdez, have come up with a criminal defense that is, well,
interesting.
   As a result of the tanker running aground March 24 in Alaska's
Prince William Sound, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil,
the captain faces three felony and three misdemeanor charges in
Anchorage.
   Here's his attorneys' pitch: Because Hazelwood radioed in to the
Coast Guard that his tanker was leaking oil, he had incriminated
himself, presumably without aid of counsel or having been advised
of his ``Miranda'' rights.
   Don't like that one? Try this one:
   Because of state and federal laws that grant immunity to people
who report oil spills, the fact that Hazelwood radioed the Coast
Guard that the tanker had run aground and was ``leaking some oil''
made him an oil-spill reporter, and therefore subject to immunity.
   Hazelwood a whistle-blower? On whom, himself?
   Come on!

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on garbage disposal and
racketeers:
   Do Americans want to depend on racketeers to take care of their
garbage?
   That's another element of the problem of solid waste disposal
that must be considered as landfills are being exhausted and the
volume of refuse mounts.
   Public hearings last month in Philadelphia revealed the East
Coast crime families that have long dominated the waste-disposal
industry in New York and New Jersey through intimidation and murder
already have branched out into Pennsylvania. They are expected to
look next at the Midwest _ and possibly the South.
   The threat is more alarming because it comes at a time when the
nation is approaching a crisis on solid waste disposal. The risk to
public safety is becoming increasingly clear, particularly as mob
muscle can be applied to achieve monopoly control of the industry.
   Profits in the industry can be enormous. Waste disposal is not a
field in which many businessmen are interested.
   States are fighting back through laws requiring background
investigations of waste haulers and landfill operations in an
effort to block mob control. However, a cooperative, inter-regional
response may be needed, as will some federal assistance.
   The gangster threat only further underlines the fact that an
effective, overall response to the solid waste problem must be
implemented _ and soon. Public health is at stake, and if a crunch
comes, the public must avoid the additional threat of being at the
mercy of the mob.

   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on TV news re-creations:
   Why all the fuss about television networks using dramatic
re-creations of news events?
   In July, ABC news touched off a furor by broadcasting a
dramatization, with actors, of American diplomat Felix Bloch's
supposed exchange of documents with a Soviet citizen. Critics said
the sequence blurred the line between reality and dramatics, a line
that television news should regard as holy.
   These folks take television news too seriously.
   They applauded NBC's decision ... to join ABC in promising not
to use such dramatizations. Their criticism turned to CBS, which
steadfastly refuses to change. More power to CBS, whose defiant
stance proclaims what the so-called critics refuse to admit: that
television news is entertainment pure and simple. ...
   Television spreads the image _ not the word _ better than any
other medium, and some images will never die. ...
   The boob tube can be incredibly amusing, transporting us from
Berlin to Las Vegas, taking us from Zsa Zsa Gabor to President
Bush, moving us from laughter to tears.
   While ABC and NBC continue their impossible quest for a news
program beyond the boundaries of entertainment, the rest of us can
turn to CBS, where television news is lauded for what it really is:
a nightly half-hour of informative escapism.

   Kenosha (Wis.) News on Japanese takeovers:
   For everybody worried about the Japanese ``takeover'' of America
_ first Columbia Pictures, then Rockefeller Center, next Mount
Rushmore? _ there's finally some reassuring news. One American is
fighting back.
   Well, wrestling back, anyway. He's Salevaa Atisnoe, a 490-pound
Samoan-American from Hawaii. Using the professional name Konishiki,
he has battled his way to the summit of Japanese sports, recently
winning Japan's most prestigious prize, the Emperor's Cup, and
establishing himself as the nation's premier sumo wrestler.
   The Japanese have greeted Konishiki's stunning victory with
apparent good cheer. He seems to have a natural appeal for his fans
_ perhaps because in sheer physical dimensions he bears a striking
resemblance to Rockefeller Center. In fact, the vast majority of
the crowd attending his championship match rooted for him
unashamedly.
   In commerce and culture, ours is a small world and getting
smaller, as the Japanese have obviously come to realize. Let's hope
we react with similar equanimity when the Tokyo Giants win the
National League East.

<HEAD>Transplant Patients' Cancer Rate To Be Studied</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers at the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
will conduct a five-year study of the rate at which some people who
receive transplanted organs develop cancer.
   In the process, the $5 million study _ funded by the National
Cancer Institute _ may provide clues to the relationship between
cancer and viruses and the way in which the body combats those
diseases, one official said Tuesday.
   ``It has broad implications for better understanding of
mechanisms that lead to the development of cancer,'' said Dr.
Theresa Whiteside, director of the institute's immunologic
monitoring and diagnostic laboratory and a professor of pathology
at the University of Pittsburgh.
   About 400 adults and children who have received transplants will
be recruited to participate in the study.
   Whiteside said one of the most significant aspects of the study
is that researchers will be able to study a large group of people,
some of whom they know will develop cancer.
   It will build on observations made in 1975 by Pittsburgh liver
transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl, who discovered when he was at
the University of Colorado that 2 to 3 percent of all transplant
recipients developed cancer.
   The most common malignancies diagnosed among those patients were
lymph node cancer, liver cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer
also common among AIDS patients.
   Starzl, along with Dr. Israel Penn, also found that the risk of
cancer after a transplant increased to 10 percent for patients
whose pre-transplant tests showed they did not have antibodies to
the Epstein Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis.
   About 80 percent of those patients become infected with the
virus after transplantation, and researchers believe there is some
correlation between that and the development of cancer,
particularly in the lymph nodes.
   Researchers also will try to determine why liver transplant
recipients whose previous liver was removed because of cancer often
develop the cancer again with the new organ.
   In such patients, the cancer does not show up in other parts of
the body.
   ``We are not even sure if it is the same cancer that returns to
the new liver or a new cancer that arises in the liver. Nothing is
known about this,'' she said.
   The return of cancer, Whiteside said, must have something to do
with a person's immune system after transplantation or the immune
defenses within the liver itself.
   Transplant patients get drugs to suppress their body's natural
defenses after surgery to prevent rejection of the new organs, and
the drugs also make the patients susceptible to other infections.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury today convicted a 24-year-old
man of operating a $2 million-a-week cocaine-distribution network
in the nation's capital, a verdict that mandates life imprisonment.
   Rayful Edmond III was found guilty of all seven counts against
him after more than four days of deliberations that capped a
12-week trial. Ten co-defendants were convicted of related charges.
   During the 20 minutes that the verdicts were read, the 11
defendants stood impassively before U.S. District Judge Charles
Richey, occasionally glancing down at the floor or shaking their
heads slowly as the guilty verdicts mounted. The jury returned an
innocent verdict on only one of the 23 counts in the indictment.
   Edmond, of Washington, stood stoically throughout the
proceeding, his hands folded in front of him and a serious
expression on his face.
   The charges against him included conspiracy to violate narcotics
laws, employing persons under 18 to possess and distribute cocaine,
traveling across state lines to sell drugs and using a telephone to
set up illegal drug deals.
   Convictions on those counts satisfy a definition of a continuing
criminal enterprise, a crime which carries a mandatory life
sentence.
   Edmond's co-defendants, who include an aunt, a sister, a brother
and several close friends, were found guilty of assisting him.
Prosecutors said at the trial that the drug ring accounted for up
to 30 percent of the District of Columbia's cocaine market.
   Richey did not immediately set a sentencing date.
   The verdicts ended a complex, courtroom drama in which
prosecutors depicted Edmond as the head of a vast and deadly drug
network that took in $2 million a week.
   The trial was unusual from the outset, when the judge ruled that
the names of jurors would be kept secret even from himself and
lawyers to protect them from possible reprisals.
   The home of one witness' mother was firebombed during the trial,
an informant was shot after being accidentally exposed by the
prosecution. The trial was conducted in a courtroom with a
bullet-proof plastic shield 1{ inches thick, and further protection
was provided by a metal detector set up for the trial outside the
courtroom in which the case was argued.
   At its peak last summer, prosecutors said, Edmond and his
cohorts moved up to 440 pounds of cocaine per week into Washington.
The city has experienced more than 400 homicides this year, most of
them attributed by police to drug activities.
   Edmond was described by prosecutors as a flashy entrepreneur who
lavished expensive gifts _ including luxury automobiles _ on
friends, family members and loyal lieutenants in his organization.
   Edmond's lawyers said the government had not proved its case
against him.
   In closing arguments last Thursday, defense attorney James
Robinson challenged the credibility of prosecution witnesses,
saying evidence against some of the co-defendants did not point to
Edmond as the leader of a drug enterprise.
   ``There was a lot of testimony from a lot of people who got
caught dealing drugs,'' Robinson said. ``The problem was ... making
a connection between that activity and Rayful Edmond III.''
   Edmond is charged with additional crimes _ including three
counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy counts _ and is
expected to face two more trials.

<TEXT>
   Seven months before New Hampshire cast the
ninth and deciding vote to ratify the U.S. Constitution in 1788,
the governor had 400 copies printed so voting delegates could read
it.
   All were thought to have been lost, until Michael Munroe,
president of the Newbury Historical Society, found one last spring
in papers in the vault in the old Town Hall. The vault was filled
with papers from the Legislature that the town had given to the
historical society.
   State Archivist Frank Mevers confirmed the document was one of
the copies printed by John Melcher at the direction of Gov. John
Sullivan.
   ``We're 100 percent sure this document was printed in December
of 1787,'' Mevers said. The types of paper, the handwriting, ink
and print all convinced him of the document's authenticity.
   Whether New Hampshire would ratify the Constitution was in doubt
in the months before the vote. Supporters, called federalists, said
a strong government was needed to provide stability and pull the
country out of economic recession.
   Opponents said the Constitution would lay the groundwork for the
kind of tyrannical central government they had fought in the
Revolution.
   After months of pro-Constitution lobbying, federalists won
ratification with a 57-47 vote in Concord on June 21, 1788.
   Mevers said the document's value isn't certain, and the only way
to determine that would be by auction. But Munroe said the
historical society in the town of about 1,000 residents plans to
keep it.
   ``We'd like to have it displayed,'' he said. ``We'd like to be
able to have people see it, but we don't have the facility to do
that.''
   He said it's possible the society could loan the document to the
state historical society museum.

<HEAD>Cold Fusion Defense May Affect Tenure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some faculty members at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology are upset that a physicist who publicly supported
researchers' claims of achieving cold fusion may win tenure, a
newspaper reported today.
   At MIT, where millions of dollars have been spent on research
into conventional fusion as a potential energy source, many
scientists challenged a report of cold fusion energy, but Peter L.
Hagelstein defended it.
   Cold fusion was envisioned as a source of limitless energy last
spring when Utah researcher B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann
of Great Britain said their experiment fused hydrogen atoms without
the high temperatures believed necessary for such a reaction.
   At a news conference April 14, Hagelstein theorized that a
previously unknown nuclear phenomenon was involved in cold fusion,
and MIT filed for a patent on potential applications of his ideas.
   But other MIT physicists scoffed at the idea, and chemists said
Hagelstein did not understand that a chemical, rather than
physical, reaction might have occurred. Other laboratories were
unable to reproduce the Utah results.
   The Boston Globe said it was told by unidentified sources at MIT
that tenure for Hagelstein, 34, has support in his department of
electrical engineering but that the way he got MIT into the cold
fusion controversy has become an issue.
   Critics said it was not so much his theory as the way it was
presented _ through the news media rather than submitting it to
review by scientists, the Globe said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police arrested four leftist radicals
Wednesday for throwing firebombs to protest the expansion of
Tokyo's international airport, officials said.
   Protesters hurled firebombs and bricks at riot police from four
50-foot towers erected at the site by the demonstrators. Police
eventually overpowered them with water cannons.
   Riot police lowered steel cages over the towers to prevent them
from hurling more projectiles.
   About 200 radical opponents of the airport rallied nearby to
protest the police action but did not clash with them, the official
said.
   Seven radicals have been arrested since Monday, when about 5,000
riot police began to remove one of 10 huts built illegally on the
site of the planned second runway of the New Tokyo International
Airport, 40 miles northeast of Tokyo, the Chiba Prefectural Police
said.
   Eight farmers own land on or near the planned expansion site,
refusing to yield it for construction of additional runways to ease
congestion.
   The airport handled 17.24 million passengers in 1988, 4 million
more than it was originally designed for, the airport authority
said.
   Forty-eight airlines from 37 countries use the $2.5 billion
airport, which opened in 1978 with just one runway.
   By next year, the government plans to build two more runways,
one of 8,250 feet and another of 10,560 feet.
   Anti-government radicals have been supporting the farmers in
their battle to keep their land from being taken from them for the
new runways.
   On Monday, Transport Minister Takami Eto became the first
government official to apologize for the state's failure to consult
adequately with farmers when the airport first was planned 23 years
ago.

   For Nigeria's foreign minister, it was not
a happy landing.
   As the private jet carrying Maj.-Gen. Ike Nwachukwu descended
over Lusaka International Airport on Nov. 16, the pilot broke the
news: the runway landing lights were off, the airport was dark and
there was no response from the control tower.
   The crew managed to call the airport fire station and made and
emergency landing, aided by the lights from four fire trucks.
   President Kenneth Kaunda set up a commission to investigate the
affair. The state-owned Times of Zambia reported on the inquiry in
its Wednesday editions.
   Nwachukwu was on an official mission to confer with African
heads of state in Lusaka.
   Chief Zambian protocol officer Mkhondo Lungu, testifying before
the commission, said he believed a thunderstorm may have knocked
out the runway lights, but he couldn't explain why no one was in
the control tower, or why only a junior official was ordered to
meet Nwachukwu.
   The inquiry was continuing.

   The Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has taken a heavy toll
in the past two years.
   Casualties on both sides have mounted as the ``intefadeh'' _
Arabic for uprising _ drags on without political solution.
   More than 820 people have died, according to a tally kept by The
Associated Press.
   They include 626 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians and 154 Palestinians slain by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have
died in the violence, including 11 soldiers.
   The Palestinian fatalities include 132 children, says the Israel
Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories.
   Thousands have been wounded.
   According to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which oversees
relief programs for Palestinian refugees, nearly 40,000
Palestinians have suffered injuries ranging from tear gas
inhalation to beatings and gunshot wounds. The army puts the
Palestinian injury total at 8,926.
   The army spokesman's office says 2,438 Israelis have been
wounded, including 1,635 soldiers.
   Sixty Palestinians have been deported and about 40,000 jailed in
the past two years. There are 9,142 in prison now, including 1,562
``administrative detainees'' held without charge or trial.
   Both sides have lost economically, too.
   Nahum Lev, chief economist at Bank Hapoalim, estimated Israel's
economic growth in 1989 was reduced by about one-half percent _
about $200 million _ because of business disruptions and trade
losses stemming from the uprising.
   The toll in the first year was about $600 million, Israeli
economists estimated.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the size of the gross
national product has shrunk by at least 25 percent, from about $1.5
billion in 1987 to about $1.125 billion now, Awartani estimated.
GNP is a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy.
   ``People are suffering,'' said Hisham Awartani, a leading
Palestinian economist. ``I'm not optimistic about 1990, either.''
   Lev believes the impact on Israel is decreasing because the
economy has more or less adjusted to new realities.
   He noted, for example, that many companies are hiring Israelis
to replace Palestinians, who often missed work because of strikes
or other uprising-related problems.
   ``The Israeli workers are more expensive, but they produce more
so output is rising,'' Lev said.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, agriculture, construction and
service industries are suffering, Awartani said. The only bright
spot is industry.
   ``Hundreds of factories have sprung up,'' he said. ``Some are
cottage industries, but many are real factories employing 20 or 30
people.''
   The Palestinian factories are finding a ready market because of
the uprising boycott of Israeli-made goods. But Awartani said the
fledgling industries will have to worry about quality and price
competition if they are going to survive.

on Gorbachev proposal.</HEAD>

   President Bush ruled out at the Malta summit a
proposal from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to restrict the
superpowers' navies, including removing nuclear weapons from
surface warships, the White House said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told Gorbachev
``it was unacceptable to us because the United States is a naval
power. We depend upon the seas for contact with all of our allies
and with other continents of the world.''
   ``The Soviet Union is a land-based power. But the navy is
crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our commitments around
the world, maintaining open sea lanes and commercial lanes around
the world,'' he said.
   ``It simply is so key and vital to our basic role in world
military affairs as well as commercial affairs that we cannot
consider that,'' the spokesman said, adding that ``I don't detect
any flexibility at this point'' on the issue.
   Gorbachev expressed concern at the weekend summit that his
country was surrounded by U.S. naval power, and even gave Bush a
KGB-produced map of U.S. installations to hammer home the point.
``He would like to see reductions in the naval forces,'' said
Fitzwater.
   ``He gave us the chart, the map. We made some jokes that we'd
fill in the blanks and that was about it,'' the White House
spokesman added.
   The White House also announced today that Bush is delegating
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to coordinate
U.S. support to Eastern Europe, including the recently passed $938
million in aid for Poland and Hungary.
   Bush met in the Oval Office today with former Italian Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi.
   Craxi, prime minister from 1983 to 1987 as head of the Italian
Socialist Party, said after the meeting that the Malta summit gave
``a further impulse'' to the changes taking place in Europe.
   Craxi was also visiting congressional leaders and receiving an
honorary degree from Catholic University.
   The White House denied on Tuesday that there was any difference
in attitudes toward the Soviets between Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle, who said in a newspaper interview that the Soviets were ``a
totalitarian government'' that had not ``changed much in foreign
policy.''
   Bush, in his first public comments since returning to the White
House from Europe on Monday, told a GOP fund-raising dinner Tuesday
night that the United States should help spur democratic changes
inside the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe despite persistent
differences over Soviet aid to leftist governments in Latin America.
   ``I look at Malta as a hopeful step in a new relationship,''
Bush said.
   He told the crowd of 600 at a $1,000-a-plate dinner for the
Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, ``We have some
differences obviously with ... past performance of the Soviet and
regrettably, I'm afraid, in the future.''
   ``But we're going to keep on working this. I was up front ...
about the destabilizing flow of arms into the region from nations
that are receiving Soviet support.''
   He acknowledged: ``When you go to a meeting of this nature,
there's trepidation. People wonder how it's going to come out.''
   ``We have an administration that is very closely aligned but I
think it probably not possible for people to speak literally with
one voice,'' said national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, adding
there was no difference in the ``substance'' of their views.
   Quayle told Knight-Ridder editors and reporters Tuesday that
``there's no good guy, bad guy strategy'' between himself and Bush.
   Some conservatives have expressed unhappiness over the summit,
saying that Bush gave the Soviets economic concessions without
securing a commitment to keep Moscow-made weapons out of Central
America.
   At the summit, Bush endorsed giving Moscow observer status at
the world's leading economic regulatory body and proposed June as a
target date for completing a trade agreement granting the Soviet
Union most-favored-nation status, which would result in an easing
of trade barriers.

   All foreign citizens trapped by rebel fighting
in Manila hotels, including some 280 Americans, have been bused to
safety, the White House said today.
   ``The U.S. Embassy is working to help these individuals with
their travel plans,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said the evacuations were completed without incident. ``All
Americans were reported safe and we have no reports of injuries,''
he said.
   ``I'm very encouraged about that,'' President Bush said earlier
when asked if all the Americans were safe.
   In Manila today, President Corazon Aquino declared a state of
national emergency, but it was unclear what additional powers her
government would wield with the declaration.
   Fitzwater declined to comment on the emergency declaration,
other than to say ``we will take a look at it and see if we have
any concerns.''
   State Department spokesman Mark Dillon said earlier today that
U.S. officials were trying to determine what the emergency
declaration specifically means.
   ``We're still getting reports on what the state of emergency
declaration includes,'' Dillon said, adding that there had not been
any additional requests for American assistance.
   On Tuesday, U.S. Embassy and Philippine authorities said 164
Americans were out safely, and that the evacuation appeared
complete.
   Consular officers met 30 buses at a reception center established
at a shopping center near the airport. Some 2,000 foreigners were
trapped for four days in hotels by the military coup attempt that
had killed at least 77 people.
   The U.S. response to the drama was decidedly low key Tuesday as
the administration sought to avoid language that could further
inflame tensions.
   The administration suggested the plight of the trapped
foreigners was not so much a hostage taking as it was the product
of the ongoing military revolt against Mrs. Aquino.
   To U.S. officials, the most disquieting aspect of the situation
were statements by some rebels that the Americans might not be
released to punish the Bush administration for its support for the
Aquino government.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there was no
indication that Americans had been singled out for mistreatment.
   Capt. Albert Yen, one of the insurgents, reflected the
sentiments of rebel hard-liners when he said, ``The intention is
not to release Americans.''
   ``U.S. meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of our
assault, so we hold them liable,'' Yen said. ``It is the
responsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationals
hostage.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said Tuesday Mrs.
Aquino had not requested additional U.S. military support.

<TEXT>
   We must remember that the rebellion is not against the
government or the democratic process alone. This is a struggle
waged against the very people who had installed this leadership
when we established democracy in our country. The people too are
the intended victim. Although the government is prepared to deal
with this fierce strategy decisively, our people must join us in
giving the enemy the final blow. ...
   They just want to grab power. They do not think whether they
will inflict suffering on the Filipino people. How many innocent
civilians were killed? They did not think that lives of Filipinos
matter. The constant preoccupation is finding ways wherein they can
rule and have power.
   We still remember what martial law was like. Those people we
suspect are involved in what is happening now to our country, these
same peole believe they are the only ones who have power. During
martial law, we didn't have a duly ratified constitution. We didn't
have press freedom. During those times, when somebody wrote or said
something against the government, they were arrested and sometimes
even killed. ...
   I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake for
democracy. I have lost my husband. In 1983, he was killed. Many of
us suffered and until now we have put our lives at stake.
   You know what happened last Friday when rockets were fired at
Malacanang. What did these people want? It is very clear that these
people want to kill me, to eliminate me, so that they can rule our
land. What they have forgotten is that power is not theirs to take.
They cannot just grab power by killing people. They have to
understnd that power belongs to you, my beloved countrymen. Why did
I become president? That was because you believed in me. And in
spite of all of the coup attempts, you have stuck by me. And I know
that I owe my being president to you.
   I did not think of being president. I just wanted to serve you,
I just wanted to restore democracy. I want to respect your rights.
I am only asking you to help me. You are my only source of strength
to continue our reforms in government. I also depend on you to see
for yourself what these people are doing to us. ...
   Show our enemies that we, the Filipino people, love our coutnry.
We do not want these killings. We reject these people whose only
concern is their own interest. You, my beloved countrymen, I depend
on you.

<HEAD>Alleged Test Buying Leads ETS to Cancel Thousands of Scores in India</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cheating in India has forced the Educational
Testing Service to reschedule a graduate test, cancel an English
proficiency test and wipe out the test scores of nearly 3,000
students.
   ETS spokesman Ray Nicosia said it was uncertain if the cheating
announced Wednesday was the largest-scale breach of standardized
test security ever. But such cases have rarely extended beyond a
single class, school or test center.
   Nicosia said ETS, based in Princeton, N.J., had received about
50 letters from Indian students and test center supervisors
indicating that students had been able to buy copies of the
standardized tests before the administration dates.
   ETS said it had learned that test materials had been improperly
obtained in advance by students for the Oct. 28 Test of English as
a Foreign Language. This prompted cancellation of exams at five
centers in the Bangalore area, affecting 620 students, according to
ETS.
   The language exam, taken annually by 500,000 students worldwide,
including 21,500 Indian students, is designed to evaluate English
proficiency in students whose native language is not English. It is
used for admission by 3,000 North American colleges and
universities.
   An investigation also found students were able to buy copies of
the Graduate Record Examination before taking last month's test.
   The test is taken primarily by college students to enter
graduate school. Most of the approximately 14,000 Indian students
who take the GRE each year are trying to gain admittance to U.S.
graduate schools.
   ETS, which administers standardized tests in 170 countries, said
it had canceled the scores of 2,744 of 4,280 test takers for the
GRE administered Oct. 14 at 17 of 27 Indian test centers.
   It said it was rescheduling the Dec. 9 GRE in India to next
month.
   An estimated 366,000 students worldwide take the GRE each year,
according to ETS.

   Insherah Shukri sat on the
dirt floor of a U.N.-supplied tent Wednesday, talking to relatives
and neighbors about her home of 25 years that was destroyed by the
Israeli army overnight.
   In Mrs. Shukri's case _ as for many of the 244 families whose
homes have been demolished by Israel in the two-year Palestinian
uprising _ the sins of a son were behind her troubles.
   Her youngest son, 26-year-old Ahmed, is accused of trying to
force a crowded Israeli bus over a cliff in September. Police say
Shukri also confessed to murdering an Israeli co-worker at a Tel
Aviv construction site and led police to the body.
   Israeli military officials maintain demolishing or sealing
houses is necessary to deter violence. International human rights
groups call it collective punishment that violates conventions on
the treatment of refugees.
   Mrs. Shukri, a 55-year-old widow, says it is unfair and
ineffective as a deterrent.
   ``I told them he doesn't own anything in the house. It's my
house. But they didn't care,'' she said.
   ``We lost everything. We lost our house. What else do we have to
lose?'' she asked.
   The Shukri family pitched the tent next to the ruins of the
six-room, two-story house they built in 1964. Living in the house
with Mrs. Shukri were her three daughters, two older sons and their
pregnant wives, and two granddaughters.
   Ahmed Shukri also lived there until his arrest in the bus
attack, which was thwarted by passengers after Shukri had stabbed
the driver.
   His eldest brother, Mahmoud, says his only regret is that Ahmed
did not succeed in plunging the bus off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem
highway.
   ``I think he did the right thing,'' said the 31-year-old
blacksmith. ``If he had succeeded in what he planned to do and died
a martyr, it would have been better.''
   Mahmoud said he hates the Israelis, who have occupied this West
Bank town of 25,000 since the 1967 Middle East War. He valued his
family's lost home at $120,000.
   The family says they will spend their days in the U.N.-donated
tent, furnished with a battered sofa from their house. During the
winter, they plan to sleep in neighbors' homes where some of their
other furniture is stored.
   Mrs. Shukri said she doesn't have the money to rent a house or
rebuild, but she added she accepted the loss.
   ``If we need a state, this is the price, even if we have to give
all our houses for Palestine,'' she said.
   The army demolished two other homes of suspected Palestinian
attackers Wednesday, both in the Gaza Strip's Jebaliya refugee
camp. One home in Gaza was sealed, raising the numbers of sealed
houses to 117 since the start of the uprising against Israeli rule
on Dec. 8, 1987.

   Two teen-agers were charged with murder
today after three bodies were found following an abduction that
involved an elderly couple checking on a neighbor, police said.
   Soldiers aboard a National Guard helicopter on Tuesday found the
bodies of Lester M. Haley, 87, and his 67-year-old wife, Nancy, in
a rural area about 10 miles east of Topeka, Douglas County District
Attorney Jim Flory said.
   A third body found early today in the same area was believed to
be that of Ida Dougherty, an elderly neighbor of the Haleys, police
said.
   A 19-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman were arrested
separately and booked on charges of murder, kidnapping, assault,
burglary and theft, police said. Authorities said they would
release the suspects' names and other information later.
   Police Lt. Bud Brooks said earlier that Haley and Verne Horne,
68, were checking Mrs. Dougherty's house Monday after seeing that a
newspaper had been left on the porch.
   They didn't find Mrs. Dougherty, but surprised a man with a gun
and were abducted, along with Mrs. Haley, who came to look for her
husband, Brooks said.
   He said the gunman dropped his captives off in a rural area, and
that Mrs. Horne got away unharmed, believing she was getting help
while the Haleys hid in woods. The bodies of the Haleys were found
in a field about two miles from where the gunman had dropped them
off, Flory said.

   The strain of a six-day coup attempt
showed upon the face of Corazon Aquino as she appealed Wednesday
for her people to stand behind her in the gravest crisis faced by
her 3{-year administration.
   Mrs. Aquino made the appeal in her first nationally televised
appearance since Sunday, when she told military mutineers to
``surrender or die.''
   But on Wednesday, it was a different ``Cory'' Aquino. Gone was
the steely, uncompromising firmness that marked not only the Sunday
speech but other addresses she has delivered during five previous
coup attempts.
   This time, her eyes were swollen and her face was drawn. She
stared plaintively into the camera like a woman who had been
betrayed.
   ``I did not think of being president,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``I
just wanted to serve you. I just wanted to restore democracy. I
want to respect your rights. I am only asking you to help me.''
   In previous crises, Mrs. Aquino delivered speeches in the crisp
monotone of a teacher lecturing an errant pupil. She prefers to
make speeches in English, an official language in the Philippines.
   On Wednesday, however, she spoke in Tagalog, a native language
better understood by ordinary Filipinos. Her choice of words and
the manner of speaking exuded more desperation than confidence.
   ``I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake for
democracy,'' she said, raising her arms slightly. ``I lost my
husband. ... Many of us suffered and until now we have put our
lives at stake.''
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain in 1983 as
he stepped from a jet after arriving in Manila from the United
States to challenge the late President Ferdinand Marcos for
leadership of the country.
   Ordinarily, Mrs. Aquino reads speeches carefully crafted by her
staff. This time, she appeared to.be speaking extemporaneuosly, and
from the heart.
   ``Why did I become president?'' Mrs. Aquino asked. ``That was
because you believed in me. And in spite of all of the coup
attempts, you have stuck by me. And I know that I owe my being
president to you.''

   A man wearing two gold chains around his
neck, several gold rings and a diamond ear stud asked for a
court-appointed attorney, but a judge denied the request and told
him to sell his jewelry.
   Terry L. Franklin, 20, appeared Tuesday in Wichita Municipal
Court on two misdemeanor marijuana possession charges and a count
of illegal gambling.
   Franklin told Judge Thomas Bush he was unemployed, had no assets
and could not afford an attorney.
   ``I just said, `If you want an attorney, sell your jewelry.'
This guy was dressed so nice and had all of this gold jewelry on
that I thought he ought to hire his own,'' Bush said.
   Franklin waived his right to an attorney, pleaded innocent to
the gambling count and guilty to the marijuana charges. He was
sentenced to 120 days in the Sedgwick County Jail and fined $400.
   When he was booked into jail, he turned in $1,100 in cash from
his pockets.

   A portrait of Queen Elizabeth II that
makes no attempt to hide her wrinkles, furrowed brow and gray hair
went on display Wednesday, and its creator said the monarch likes
it a lot.
   The painter, Richard Stone, said he realized some people might
be shocked by the life-size picture, which shows the queen in
profile wearing a crown, jewelry and robes for the annual state
opening of Parliament.
   ``No one should be offended because the queen is 63 after all
and she is still a fine-looking woman for her years,'' said Stone,
38, who has completed 15 other portraits of royal family members.
   ``She has seen the painting and she is delighted with it,''
Stone said.
   Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the portrait, unveiled
at the town hall in Colchester, 50 miles northeast of London. It
was commissioned to mark the 800th anniversary of the royal charter
granted to Colchester.
   The picture will hang permanently in the town hall after final
work on it is completed in the spring.
   The queen sat for the portrait in a series of 90-minute sessions
in a yellow drawing room at Buckingham Palace.

transferring control of the waterway to Panama.
   ``We think this was the correct course of action,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in replying to charges by members
of the political opposition in Panama.
   The treaties require that a Panamanian take charge as
administrator of the canal on Jan. 1, 1990, for the first time in
the 75-year history of the waterway. The treaties also stipulate
that it is up to the government of Panama to nominate a canal
administrator, then for the U.S. president to appoint him, subject
to Senate confirmation.
   But the United States refuses to recognize the government put in
power by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and has spurned its choice
for the post on a permanent basis.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. decision to name an acting administrator
reflects `the political realities of the situation'' and allows
``uninterrupted compliance with the treaty'' and continued
operation of the canal without introducing ``a new political figure
in here that would result in political turmoil.''
   Bush announced Tuesday he has asked the canal's deputy
administrator, Fernando Manfredo, to take over as acting
administrator.
   ``I have accepted because I consider it the only responsible
option under the circumstances,'' Manfredo said in a written
statement in Panama.
   Opposition leaders warned that Bush's action ``creates an
irregular situation not foreseen in the treaties.''
   ``We warn the United States that because of its irregularity
this situation disrupts the orderly process of nationalization of
the canal that we Panamanians claim as an irreversible process,''
said the statement from former opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara and his vice presidential running mates Ricardo
Arias and Guillermo Ford.
   The man recommended by the Panamanian government for the job,
Tomas Altamirano-Duque, director-president of Panama's biggest
newspaper and a former lawmaker for the Democratic Revolutionary
Party, published a letter in his newspaper last month saying
Manfredo would be guilty of treason if he accepted the position.
   Manfredo, commerce minister under the late Panamanian leader
Omar Torrijos, said in his statement, ``I am confident that when
emotions are cooled down all will agree that I did the right
thing.''
   There was no official government comment.
   The White House said a permanent appointment would be made ``at
such time as a legitimate Panamanian government exists and proposes
its candidate for administrator in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the treaty and applicable law.''
   ``As this step demonstrates, the U.S. is committed to meeting
the requirements of the Panama Canal Treaty even under current
circumstances in which no legitimate government authority exists in
Panama,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement.
   Manfredo would succeed Dennis McAuliffe, a former commander of
U.S. military forces in Panama who has been administrator of the
canal commission for a decade.
   The treaty also requires that an American be named deputy
administrator in 1990. The White House said that decision will be
made later by the board of directors of the canal commission.
   The transfer of power to Panama will be completed at the end of
the century, when Panama assumes full control of the canal.
   Bush announced last week he is banning Panamanian-flag vessels
from entering U.S. ports after Jan. 31. It is the latest step to
bring economic pressure on the Central American nation to force the
ouster of Noriega, wanted in the United States on drug racketeering
charges.

   The main rebel alliance in Burma has
set up a radio station at a jungle base close to the Thai frontier,
a rebel spokesman said Wednesday.
   The Voice of the Democratic Alliance of Burma began news
broadcasts in Burmese and English on Saturday, said spokesman Tu Ja
Manan.
   The station also broadcast in the languages of 10 ethnic groups
fighting the central government for greater autonomy and other
goals, he said.
   Maung Kyawhlaint, another rebel spokesman, said the broadcasts
could be heard clearly in the border area, but not in Bangkok
because of interference.
   The alliance was formed to unite Burma's ethnic and religious
rebel groups with students who joined them after the military
brutally crushed a pro-democracy uprising in September 1988.
   The rebels have fought the government for more than four decades.

<TEXT>
   A non-Communist took over as head of state
today for the first time in East Germany's history, and the
state-run media said it had received reports that demonstrators
were storming army installations.
   Manfred Gerlach, the leader of the non-Communist Liberal
Democrat Party, announced on national television that he was named
the new interim head of state and that he will serve until
Parliament elects a permanant president.
   His announcement came shortly after the official media said Egon
Krenz, the former Communist Party chief, had resigned as head of
state.
   The state-run news agency ADN announced it had indications that
people were storming army installations, and it appealed for the
pro-democracy movement to remain calm during the political crisis.
   ``In the last few hours, there have been growing indications of
stormings of facilities and installations of the National People's
Army,'' the government said in a statement distributed by ADN.
   It did not specify where the assaults were taking place, or say
how many people were involved. The government called for ``calm and
restraint.''
   On Tuesday, angry citizens began surrounding and in some cases
forcing their way into buildings housing the secret police in an
effort to stop the destruction of documents needed in prosecutions
of former Communist officials.
   The Liberal Democrats were long allied with the Communist Party
but have since said that they will no longer run in a Communist-led
bloc.
   Gerlach has been spearheading drives for reforms in East Germany
and has been taking on an increasingly prominent role since the
ouster of hard-line Communist Party leader Erich Honecker on Oct.
18.
   The political makeup of East Germany, which was founded in 1949,
is being shaped by the pro-democracy movement on a day-by-day basis.
   The country is now run by a 25-member committee of Communists
who took over when the Communist leadership resigned Sunday. A
special party congress will decide on a new party leadership Friday.
   A non-Communist has never before held the post of president in
East Germany. Under previous Communist governments, the post had
been largely ceremonial, but it was unclear whether it would have a
more important role in the current turmoil shaking the country.
Reflecting the political crisis in the country, Gerlach said he was
``not happy'' about taking on the new duties.
   Also today, the Defense Council, which commands the armed
forces, resigned. Krenz, who had led the council, came to power on
Oct. 18, but he was unpopular because of his ties to the previous
leadership. He has now lost all his posts.
   He resigned as Communist party chief on Sunday, along with the
ruling Politburo and the entire policy-making Central Commitee.
   The embattled Communists, who had planned to hold the emergency
congress on Dec. 15, will now hold it Friday and totally revamp the
party structure.
   Reform began in East Germany after Honecker was forced out
following 18 years in power. Since then, a popular uprising and
exodus of thousands of people to the West have forced the Communist
government to open East Germany's borders and the Berlin Wall to
allow citizens to travel freely.
   The Communist Party also has given up its guaranteed monopoly on
power.
   The swift and wholly unexpected changes have left what many
people in this country regard as a dangerous power vaccuum in East
Germany.
   The official ADN news agency said the emergency Communist Party
congress on Friday will propose a ``radical'' reformation of the
party into a ``modern socialist party committed to democratic
socialism.''
   There already has been widespread talk of renaming the Communist
Party, while the leadership itself has warned it faces a possible
breakup.
   ``The congress must make a final break with the Stalinist
system'' and put the party on an even footing with other political
forces, ADN said. It said the Communists want to elect a leadership
that will be able to ``guarantee its full authority as a party with
equal rights in the reform of society.''
   No reason was given today for Krenz's resignation as president.
The announcement came three days after he quit as Communist Party
chief because his ties to former party leaders made him
unacceptable to the reform movement.
   Krenz has been virtually without power since stepping down as
Communist Party general secretary on Sunday.
   His ties with past leaders had made him the target of growing
criticism, within the party and among opposition groups. He was
president since Oct. 24.

   Leftist guerrillas shot down a
military observation plane, and scattered fighting killed five
rebels and two government soldiers, the army said Wednesday.
   The O-2 observation plane was shot down by rebel rifle fire
Tuesday near the town of Ozatlan, 88 miles southeast of the
capital, killing the pilot, the army said.
   The rebel clandestine Radio Venceremos said the plane _ the
second downed in the past month _ was shot down as it was firing
rockets at rebel position.
   An A-37 jet fighter-bomber was similarly shot down by the rebels
Nov. 18 in the eastern province of San Miguel.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front broadcast said the
rebels have damaged 23 government aircraft during a new offensive
they launched Nov. 11, but the claim could not be independently
verified and military sources refused to confirm or deny it.
   Government planes recently have been forced to fly low and
suffer greater exposure to automatic weapons fire after the rebels
were supplied with Soviet-made SAM-7s and other surface-to-air
missiles.
   President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government accused
Nicaragua of supplying the Salvadoran guerrillas with the rockets
after several of them were found in two small aircraft that crashed
in El Salvador on Nov. 25.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government neither confirmed nor
denied the accusation and Cristiani suspended diplomatic relations
with Managua.
   Except for one bus that police said was set afire, the capital
remained free of violence Wednesday for the first time since the
offensive began.
   The army said fighting occurred overnight and early Wednesday
around Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of the capital, where three
rebels were killed, and on the slopes of El Rosario mountain, six
miles to the southwest, where two guerrillas and two soldiers were
killed.

   There's always a warm and boisterous crowd
upstairs at the Crossroads bar, but walk in on Thursday night's
gang and you'll be stunned by the lively silence.
   Clinking beer mugs, darts hitting a board and an occasional fist
on the table are the only sounds. The banter is carried on with
fluttering hands and a tap on the wrist by the dozens of deaf and
hearing impaired who make this Back Bay neighborhood bar their own
once a week.
   ``Deaf is a small world,'' Laurie Szynal, of Fall River, said
through a signing interpreter. ``Where else do you go to meet deaf
people and socialize?''
   The Thursday night gang at Crossroads has grown from a few
friends a few years ago to capacity crowds of 150 to 300 people
from all over New England who gather each Thursday in the
comfortable, collegiate atmosphere for conversation and camaraderie.
   Visitors to the city also stop by, including students from
Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., the nation's only
university for the hearing impaired.
   The regulars say it's their only alternative to deaf clubs,
which cater to older crowds with bingo games and bridge.
   One cold Thursday night in November, patrons gathered with an
interpreter around the end of the bar and told how important the
gathering is to the young deaf community. It's a time when everyone
in the bar speaks their language.
   Brent Jolley, one of the group's founder, now works behind the
bar on Thursday, giving signers an advantage any thirsty soul who
ever called to a barkeep can appreciate.
   ``I can take an order across the room and by the time you get to
the bar I can have it ready,'' Jolley said.
   When Sabrina Dennison, a 21-year-old from Portsmouth, N.H.,
tells her hearing friends she's going to a Boston bar, they think
of getting all dolled up to dance and flirt.
   ``That's not the point here,'' she said. ``It's to meet old
friends and deaf people. I just dress anyway I feel.''
   The group comes from all walks of life. Ron Harrison works with
the mentally retarded; Szynal is a graduate of Newbury College in
Brookline who is interested in fashion design; Jolley works for the
Legislature; Charlie Mokotoff teaches at Northeastern University in
Boston; Dennison is an actress.
   Hearing people are welcome, and if someone knows how to sign
they can ususally join any of the highly visible conversations.
   ``It's special here because the deaf and the hearing and the
hearing impaired all have a chance to mix,'' Harrison said.
   The jukebox occasionally kicks on when a hearing person drops in
a quarter; around the room the conversation goes on uninterrupted.
   Some hearing people who unwittingly stumble upon the group,
however, find it ``hard to understand deaf culture,'' said Joe
Cardillo, who is deaf.
   Some take offense, for example, when the deaf pound a table or
stamp on the floor, sending out vibrations to get the attention of
another deaf person.
   ``Hearing can call you and get your attention. Hearing thinks
the pounding is a stupid thing to do,'' Cardillo said. ``It's my
way. I have to do it that way to get people's attention.''
   Many hearing people learning to sign at nearby universities stop
by to find patient conversation partners, and maybe even learn a
few deaf jokes.
   ``You learn better here talking to deaf people because its more
natural,'' said Peter Hawker of Medford, who learned to sign to
communicate with his deaf brother. ``After they see you're someone
learning to sign, these guys will turn around, shake your hand and
invite you in.''
   Sign language's special syntax gives the deaf their own brand of
humor and a repertoire of jokes not easily related to the hearing
world.
   But the deaf have an advantage in a pastime as old as barrooms _
eavesdropping.
   ``Sure,'' Mokotoff said, jumping up on a chair and looking
across the room. ``Want to know what they're saying at that table
over there?''

   A truck bomb exploded during rush hour
today in downtown Bogota, and officials said at least 31 people
were killed and 950 injured near a building housing Colombia's
federal police force.
   Several stores were destroyed, and police appealed for anyone in
the area with picks and shovels to help search through rubble for
survivors. Cries for help could be heard beneath some of the ruins,
according to radio reports.
   The explosion, which heavily damaged the police building, left a
crater 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide and damaged or destroyed 60
cars.
   The roof of a car 10 feet from the crater was flattened, and a
body was hanging from the window.
   The owner of a hardware store cried out in agony when he saw the
bodies of his wife and daughter brought out of the rubble. Only his
little girl's patent leather shoes were visible beneath the bloody
sheet covering her.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell
on drug traffickers who have repeatedly bombed the nation's cities
in an effort to stop the government from extraditing suspected
traffickers to the United States.
   The explosion occurred less than 24 hours after the government
said a bomb placed aboard a Colombian airliner had caused it to
crash shortly after takeoff from Bogota last month, killing all 107
people aboard. Authorities believe the drug traffickers also may
have been responsibile for that bomb.
   Also today, a reputed Colombian drug dealer who is a nephew of
one of the nation's drug kingpins was reportedly arrested in
Switzerland.
   The truck, which was rigged with dynamite, exploded in front of
the headquarters of the Department of Administrative Security,
Colombia's federal investigations police.
   The bomb heavily damaged the headquarters, which contain the
offices of many federal judges. All the windows in the front of the
building were blown out and broken blocks of concrete hung from
many of the offices. The blast occurred at 7:30 a.m., after the
headquarters had opened for the day.
   Casualty reports changed almost by the minute, but bodies of
dead and injured people were spread over a five-square-block area.
   Health Minister Eduardo Diaz said in an interview with the radio
network Caracol that at least 31 people were killed. He said about
250 people were injured seriously and 700 treated for minor
injuries.
   The Colombian radio network RCN, quoting police sources and
checking with hospitals and clinics in the area, said 40 persons
had been killed.
   The police department, known as the DAS, is where many
foreigners usually line up at this time of year to get
authorization to leave the country for Christmas vacations. It was
not known immediately if any foreigners were hurt in the explosion.
The foreigners must get clearance from the DAS, which checks to see
whether they face any criminal charges in Colombia.
   The building is near a plaza that is normally filled with fruit
and candy vendors in the morning and scores of people walking to
work.
   The goverment of President Virgilio Barco declared war on the
nation's cocaine cartels after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading
presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader, was assassinated on
Aug. 18. As part of the crackdown, the government has been
extraditing drug suspects wanted on charges in the United States.
   The drug traffickers have responded with a nationwide bombing
campaign. More than 200 attacks have killed 29 people and wounded
238.
   Hours after the report on the plane bombing Tuesday, a judge
investigating drug traffickers was assassinated, the fourth judge
killed in 15 weeks.
   Judge Bernardo Jaramillo Uribe was shot to death while strolling
through Medellin, the base of the South American country's largest
cocaine cartel.
   Authorities investigating the plane crash said that a bomb had
been placed inside the passenger area of Avianca Flight 203 that
exploded Nov. 27.
   Colombians reacted with shock and fear to the report about the
plane bombing, which caused the highest death toll from a single
attack in the wave of terrorism.
   In Lugano, Switzerland, police said today that Severo ``Junior''
Escobar, reputedly one of Colombia's leading drug barons, had been
arrested in southern Switzerland.
   A police spokesman who declined to give his name confirmed
reports in the French-language Tribune de Geneve that the
30-year-old nephew of Colombian kingpin, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, 39,
was arrested Nov. 29.
   The elder Escobar is considered one of the top 12 Colombian drug
dealers sought in the United States.

<HEAD>FAA Says ``No'' to Private Albany Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE HENDRICKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to sell the Albany County Airport
to private bidders has been set back by the Federal Aviation
Administration, but proponents insist the deal is not dead.
   The negotiations to sell or lease the airport were viewed as the
possible beginning of a trend toward privatization of the nation's
municipal airports.
   James J. Coyne, the Democratic county executive who initiated
the proposal to sell the airport, said today that he felt misled by
the Reagan and Bush administrations after being told of the FAA's
disapproval.
   ``Here's an administration that has been very much a proponent,
at least verbally, concerning privatization,'' Coyne said.
   ``I feel we were misled by that administration.''
   Albany's airport and others run by cities and local governments
are increasingly beset with crowding and flight delays because
terminal expansion has failed to keep up with the growth in airline
travel. The last big airport to open was Dallas-Fort Worth's 15
years ago.
   Backers of private ownership say the profit motive would force
corporate operators to do a better job running airports than
governments do. Opponents contend private owners would raise the
fees they charge airlines, thus driving up ticket prices.
   The proposal is not dead. Coyne said he will work with
executives of British American Development Corp., of Latham, N.Y.,
and Lockheed Air Terminal Inc., of Burbank, Calif., as well as the
local bus authority, to explore ways to privatize the airport
without running into trouble with the FAA.
   ``I still feel the private sector is the best way to go,'' said
Coyne.
   FAA officials ruled earlier this week that airport revenue had
to be put back into the airport, rather than used for profits or to
repay debt raised to buy the airport.
   British American executives said the ruling was a setback, but
not a death blow to their bid.
   ``I think it has tremendous impact not only on the Albany County
Airport, but to every airport around the country,'' said Peter
Cornell, president of British American.
   ``If that stands up it is sending a signal all around the
country that we are not working toward privatization, but toward
nationalization of airports,'' Cornell said. ``Local governments
will just step away from running these airports and the federal
government will have to step in. I don't think that was the
intent.''
   One solution, Cornell said, would be to break the airport up
into segments, using revenues from operations not regulated by the
FAA, such as parking and car rentals, for profit and debt service,
while operating the airline segments separately under FAA
regulations.
   British American and Lockheed had combined to offer to buy the
airport for $30 million and run it for a profit. County officials
hoped to use the money to avoid raising taxes while financing
county operations.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the opposition, the 18-day
popular revolt that has brought their compatriots a heady dose of
freedom has been a harrowing round of endless meetings to make sure
the uprising stays on course.
   Vaclav Havel, the opposition's best-known leader, looked
exhausted Wednesday when he announced that a new government would
be formed with opposition approval later this week.
   Bustling around the opposition's new headquarters in a central
Prague gallery, grabbing sandwiches and coffee, the activists are
growing more weary with each day that brings them a real say in
Czechoslovakia's politics.
   Dissidents who once spent hours talking to reporters in their
apartments bustled in and out of a tactical session, pausing only
to smile and refusing to answer questions.
   Stanislaw Milota, a film director banned from his profession for
years, organized the opposition's own cameras to transmit Havel's
news conference.
   ``It will be good when this war is over,'' he sighed, the rings
under his eyes dark from lack of sleep.
   ``We are tired people here,'' said a weary John Bok, almost
frantic in his appeal for calm. ``We have been sleeping only one
and a half hours. So, be patient, please.''
   In the 18 astounding days that have propelled the Charter 77
dissidents who make up the core of Civic Forum from isolation to
daily negotiations with the Communists, tactics have changed almost
hourly.
   At its founding meeting Nov. 19, Civic Forum simply demanded the
ouster of five hard-line Communists associated with the crackdown
after 1968, two men linked to Nov. 17 police brutality, and an
investigation into that crackdown, threatening a general strike if
those demands were not met.
   When more than 100,000 people turned out in Prague to support
them the next day, the opposition found itself suddenly wielding
surprising force.
   On Nov. 21, there was a first meeting with Communist premier
Ladislav Adamec. At two marathon sessions Nov. 24 and Nov. 26, the
Communist Party ousted the leaders who had pursued hard-line
policies for 21 years.
   On Nov. 28, the day after the hugely successful general strike,
Adamec relinquished the Communists' 41-year hold on power, voted
out of the constitution the next day in parliament.
   All the time, the opposition was changing tactics, formulating
new demands intended to ensure that, this time, Czechoslovakia gets
real democracy, and not the Communist-led reforms crushed by a
Warsaw Pact invasion in 1968.
   Within days of Civic Forum's formation, Havel and other
dissidents who spent years in jail and isolation from society had
assembled a team of economists, lawyers and other advisers, many of
them experts who spent years in the wilderness after the crackdown
on the 1968 ``Prague Spring.''
   Changing roles swiftly from dissident playwright to political
negotiator, Havel has closeted himself with these advisers to
hammer out tactics.
   As the protest spread to workers, more representatives from the
factories were admitted to these sessions and addressed opposition
rallies.
   The composition of delegations visiting Adamec and other
officials also has changed to reflect new strands in the movement,
bringing in Slovak representatives, students, young people and
artists.
   ``It's really funny,'' said an opposition activist who did not
want to be identified. ``Everybody wants to meet with us now, to
prove how democratic they are and how they always favored reform.''
   The higher the stakes, the more the opposition has taken on the
attributes of any political organization dealing with a public avid
for news. Leaks are constantly sought, and rarely given; leading
figures who spoke publicly on any point days ago have clammed up.
   ``Please understand that we cannot answer any of the questions
you want to ask us,'' said spokesman Jiri Dienstbier after Havel
announced a new government would be formed this week. ``These are
crazy times, really crazy.''
   Another problem some activists face is that they still have jobs
amid their opposition activity.
   Dienstbier and fellow dissident Petr Uhl, for instance, swap
shifts as stokers at the same factory; their fellow workers can't
make up for them all the time.
   ``Last week, I had the wives of co-workers sending me notes as
we held our meetings, offering to work extra,'' Dienstbier said
with a chuckle.
   The success of what is half-jokingly known as the ``velvet
revolution'' _ for its smoothness _ depends on the ability of the
opposition to keep the ball rolling.
   On Tuesday, constitutional lawyers who had a blueprint for a
new, democratic constitution ready for months presented it on
behalf of Civic Forum to parliament.
   By Wednesday, the opposition had new demands to remove the
federal and Czech regional public prosecutors.
   Keeping the pressure up in this way involves the help of legions
of young people working as guards and secretaries, and running
errands.
   They bustle around the new opposition headquarters, hurriedly
relocated Tuesday to a downtown club from the nearby Laterna Magika

   ``I haven't seen the newspapers for days,'' he said smiling as
he plunged into another closed-door meeting.

<HEAD>Productivity Up Revised 2.5 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>

   American workers made modest productivity
gains in the third quarter but the lackluster manufacturing sector
posted its lowest output gain in three years and continued to slow
the overall economy, the government said Wednesday.
   And for the first time this year, the quarter-to-quarter hourly
wage gains made by workers outpaced the the growth in consumer
inflation, the Labor Department said.
   The department said overall productivity in the non-farm sector
of the economy increased at a revised annual rate of 2.5 percent in
the July-September period, more than double the anemic 1.1 percent
annual-rate gain in the second quarter.
   But in manufacturing, a sector weakened by slumping auto sales
and other problems, productivity increased at a revised annual rate
of just 1 percent after improving at an annual rate of 3.7 percent
in the April-June period.
   The poor manufacturing performance came as output rose just 1.2
percent and hours worked increased a weak 0.2 percent, reflecting
slackened demand for goods. The increase in output was the smallest
since a slight decline in the second quarter of 1986.
   Because of the poor productivity gain in manufacturing and a
significant increase in wages, unit labor costs, a key determinant
of future price inflation, rose at at an annual rate of 4.9 percent
after decreasing by 1 percent in the second quarter. It was the
largest increase in unit labor costs since the 1982 recession, the
department said.
   That increase will likely translate into either higher prices
for consumers for manufactured goods or lower profits for producers
_ or both _ and also makes it more difficult for U.S. manufacturers
to compete in overseas markets.
   ``We're getting more upward wage pressure in manufacturing and
with the weak productivity numbers, that pushes up costs,'' the
Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm.
   Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist for Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette, echoed the sentiments of most analysts in saying it was
unlikely the manufacturing sector would rebound until interest
rates drop further, which she said could come soon if November
employment data due Friday showed continued economic weakness.
   The overall 2.5 percent annual-rate productivity gain in the
non-farm sector came as output rose at a rate of 3.7 percent in the
July-September period while hours worked grew at a much slower
annual rate of 1.3 percent.
   For the overall non-farm sector, the data on unit labor costs
was more encouraging. Costs per good produced rose at a revised
annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter after rising at a
rapid 4.5 percent rate in the April-June period.
   The government said hourly compensation in the non-farm sector
grew at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the July-September period,
an increase that translated into a real earnings gain of 2.8
percent an hour when inflation is taken into account.
   The hourly compensation for manufacturing workers increased at
an annual rate of 5.9 percent. After inflation is factored into
that improvement, manufacturing workers received a real hourly
earnings boost of 3.5 percent at an annual rate in the third
quarter.
   For both the overall economy and the manufacturing sector it was
the first time this year that workers enjoyed an increase in real
hourly earnings _ wage gains minus the erosion of buying power
caused by inflation.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh overruled
staff prosecutors in ordering a preliminary inquiry into
allegations of political favoritism and perjury by former Housing
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce. Jr., Thornburgh's spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Thornburgh reversed the recommendation from the Justice
Department's public integrity section that there was an
insufficient basis to conduct a preliminary inquiry of the
allegations against Pierce, said spokesman David Runkel.
   The 60-day inquiry Thornburgh ordered will determine whether he
should seek court appointment of an independent counsel to conduct
a full criminal investigation of the former housing secretary.
   Runkel dismissed suggestions that Thornburgh had ordered the
preliminary inquiry to deflect charges from Democrats in Congress
that he was scuttling an investigation of a fellow Republican and
former Cabinet colleague in the Reagan administration.
   ``He was concerned that the issues reviewed needed further
investigation,'' Runkel said. ``He wasn't convinced by the public
integrity section's point of view.''
   The allegations that Pierce awarded Department of Housing and
Urban Development grants on the basis of political favoritism and
lied under oath during congressional hearings last spring were made
last month by 19 House Democrats.
   The lawmakers cited testimony that Pierce gave to the House
Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee that he
had not had ``hands on'' involvement in the award of HUD grants to
politically connected developers.
   The independent counsel process was triggered when the 19
Democrats, members of the House Judiciary Committee, forwarded
their allegations to Thornburgh on Nov. 2.
   In accordance with that procedure, Thornburgh disclosed Monday
his decision to conduct the preliminary inquiry.
   Pierce has denied any wrongdoing but has twice refused to give
additional testimony to the House subcommittee, citing his
constitutional right against self-incrimination.
   Pierce's lawyers have contended that the lawmakers did not
provide the Justice Department with any ``specific and credible''
evidence that their client had committed a crime.
   The public integrity section, applying that standard as outlined
in the independent counsel law, apparently agreed with that view.
   Earlier this week, Pierce's lawyers expressed confidence that
the preliminary inquiry would not result in the appointment of an
independent counsel.

<TEXT>
   Under irresistible pressure from the
rank-and-file to cleanse itself, East Germany's Communist Party is
moving at top speed against the previously iron-clad taboos of the
Stalin era.
   The latest indication came Wednesday when the official party
newspaper urged a full investigation into the deaths of thousands
of German Communists killed in Josef Stalin's purges in the 1930s
and 1940s.
   On Tuesday night, East Berlin saw its first-ever concert and the
opening of an exhibition commemorating victims of the Soviet
dictator's repression.
   An emergency party congress Friday is expected to recast the
Communists' internal structure with the aim of building a
democratically run party.
   Such a move would respond to calls in several East German
newspapers Wednesday for abolition of ``Stalinist structures'' in
the party, including such instruments of uncompromising rule from
the top as the Central Committee and Politburo.
   ``Why do we need a Politburo if we want to turn the SED (East
German Communist Party) into a democratic party?'' asked the
official party newspaper Neues Deutschland.
   New party structures must prevent ``corruption, abuse of
official position or arrogance of power,'' Berliner Zeitung
newspaper said.
   Before the special classical concert in East Berlin's opera,
author Christoph Hein told the audience, ``Today a swamp of
incredible dimensions is emerging. It will stop instilling fear
when it is reclaimed.''
   Introducing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, one speaker read a list
of victims of Stalinist repression in East Germany and paid tribute
to those killed during purges in the Soviet Union.
   Neues Deutschland, commenting on the death of thousands of
German Communists in Siberian labor camps between the world wars,
said: ``We have been silent too long about the fate of most of
them,'' and it asked how the official blind eye toward ``this sorry
chapter'' could be justified.
   East German party officials have already demanded access to
Soviet files allegedly listing the victims.
   Heinz Vosske, head of the party's central archives, suggested
that a plaque commemorating Communists killed in Stalin's time be
put up in East Berlin.
   Several leading intellectuals have been officially
rehabilitated, including the philosopher Ernst Bloch and physicist
Robert Havemann, a long-time dissident.
   The party was also considering the rehabilitation of two
journalists sacked for dissent in 1953, including a former chief
editor of Neues Deutschland.
   New Culture Minister Dietmar Keller, a Communist, recently said
the country is open for a range of opinions and the party will no
longer censor artists.
   At his first news conference, he appealed to exiled East German
cultural figures to resume ties with their native country despite
``the long shadows of history.''
   Officials have already announced that films banned in the 1960s
for questioning Stalinist policies will be be shown, some of them
for the first time.

<HEAD>Iran Says 900 Drug Smugglers Face Gallows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said Wednesday that 900 suspected
drug smugglers face the gallows in a year-old narcotics crackdown
in which more than 1,000 men and women already have been executed.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,
quoted a senior official as saying that 14,000 people, including
569 Afghans, had been arrested since March for major drug offenses.
   ``Nine hundred of these are liable for the death penalty,'' said
Kiyumars Abu, director-general of the Islamic Revolutionary
Committees' anti-narcotics division.
   Iran's anti-drug campaign could eventually dam up what has
become a major narcotics pipeline into Western Europe and the
United States.
   Human rights organizations have condemned the large number of
executions in the ruthless crackdown, begun a year ago.
   But a campaign that cuts the volume of heroin flooding into the
West could help President Hashemi Rafsanjani's efforts to end
Iran's isolation and restore relations with the West.
   It also would coincide with the U.S. war on drugs and possibly
help foster a dialogue betwen Tehran and Washington, which severed
relations with Iran in 1979.
   An anti-narcotics law passed Jan. 21 stipulates the death
penalty for anyone found with even small amounts of heroin or
opium, the base for heroin.
   Iranian authorities have hanged in a single day as many as 80
people convicted of smuggling by Iran's non-jury Islamic courts.
   The bodies are often left dangling from makeshift gallows or
overhead road bridges for the day as a warning.
   The news agency quoted Abu as saying authorities had broken up
more than 140 smuggling gangs since March and seized more than 21
tons of narcotics. Scores of the heavily armed smugglers have been
killed in battles with security forces, it said.
   More than 41,000 addicts have been arrested and sent to labor
camps for rehabilitation, Abu said, adding that 10,000 had remained
off drugs.
   Officials have estimated Iran has 1 million addicts. But the
total is believed to be double that because addiction has soared
since the 1979 Islamic revolution and during the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war.
   The Iranians are trying to coordinate their crackdown with
neighoring Pakistan and Afghanistan, where much of the heroin,
opium and hashish originates, and with Turkey.
   Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri signed an accord with Pakistan
last month to work together on anti-narcotics operations along the
border.
   Earlier this year, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan
declared war on the country's 40 drug mafias.
   But drug barons in Pakistan are deeply entrenched, and Western
drug enforcement officials say the lucrative smuggling operations
involve military and government officials.
   Stopping smuggling from neighboring Afghanistan to the northeast
is even more of a problem because of the civil war in that nation.
Moslem guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government
reportedly help bankroll their campaign by smuggling opium.
   Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan have largely replaced southeast
Asia as the key producer of heroin following a U.S. crackdown in
the East in the past decade.
   A recent U.S. State Department report on narcotics said that
``opium production and heroin trafficking are deeply entrenched''
in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   It said that between 200 and 400 tons of opium were produced in
Iran in 1987, 800 tons in Afghanistan and more than 200 tons in
Pakistan.
   The opium often is refined into heroin in secret laboratories in
Iran and smuggled into Turkey by truck.
   Other shipments are carried by mule trains through the mountains
of Kurdistan, which occupies southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran
and northern Iraq. Kurdish guerrillas are said to help and use
their profits to buy weapons for their separatist campaigns against
Iran, Iraq and Turkey.
   Nouri has assigned tens of thousands of security forces backed
by helicopter gunships to hunt down the drug smugglers.
   The smugglers are armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled
grenade launchers and anti-aircraft weapons and there have been
scores of pitched battles along the rugged eastern borders over the
last year.

   Here is the text of the five-point agreement
proposed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and conditionally
agreed to by Israel and Egypt:
   1. The United States understands that because Egypt and Israel
have been working hard on the peace process, there is agreement
that an Israeli delegation should conduct a dialogue with a
Palestinian delegation in Cairo.
   2. The United States understands that Egypt cannot substitute
itself for the Palestinians and Egypt will consult with
Palestinians on all aspects of that dialogue. Egypt will also
consult with Israel and the United States.
   3. The United States understands that Israel will attend the
dialogue only after a satisfactory list of Palestinians has been
worked out.
   4. The United States understands that the government of Israel
will come to the dialogue on the basis of the Israeli government's
May 14 initiative. The United States further understands that
Palestinians will come to the dialogue prepared to discuss
elections and the negotiating process in accordance with Israel's
initiative. The U.S. understands, therefore, that Palestinians
would be free to raise issues that relate to their opinions on how
to make elections and the negotiating process succeed.
   5. In order to facilitate this process, the U.S. proposes that
the foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt and the U.S. meet in
Washington within two weeks.
   (State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler made it clear
that because of Baker's upcoming eight-day trip to Europe and the
holiday season, the meeting referred to in the final point would
not take place within two weeks, but would be sought early next
year.)

   The United States repeatedly has called on Romania, the only

   While the Supreme Court weighs its first
``right-to-die'' decision, the Veterans Affairs Department is
drafting guidelines for dealing with those issues in its 276
medical centers and nursing homes.
   The VA currently follows the state laws such as the Missouri law
at the center of the case being reviewed by the high court. But the
department has determined that a state-by-state approach is
unworkable when both patients and doctors may transfer from
facility to facility nationwide.
   The issue has become especially critical to the VA because it
operates the nation's largest medical system and because of the age
of its clientele. Nearly half the 27 million veterans in this
country are older than 54.
   Unlike 32-year-old Nancy Cruzan, who other than her brain injury
was a healthy individual, VA patients often are old, terminally or
critically ill.
   VA actually began addressing such issues before 1983, when it
implemented a ``do-not-resuscitate'' policy on certain terminally
ill patients.
   Dr. Dorthy Rasinski, the VA physician and attorney in charge of
the ethics committee drafting the latest proposed guidelines, says
there is no conflict between the federal government arguing to
uphold the Missouri law while the VA is adopting nationwide
regulations.
   But ``there do appear to be some superficial inconsistencies,''
she acknowledged in an interview from her office at the Long Beach,
Calif., VA medical center, where she is assistant chief of staff
for education.
   On determining what a comatose patient would have wanted, the VA
is leaning toward putting the next of kin next in line, along with
the physicians, in making the decisions whether to withdraw
life-sustaining equipment, she said.
   In the Cruzan case, Ms. Cruzan's parents argued she had told
them that she would not want artificial means if ever rendered
incompetent. The Missouri Supreme Court said such statements fall
well short of the ``clear and convincing'' evidence needed to prove
her real intent.
   Rasinski said that the VA guidelines would not be so strict as
to require a ``clear and convincing'' proof _ which she interprets
as largely relying on written evidence.
   ``We would want something more than the unilateral recollection
of a single conversation,'' she said. Nurses, physicians, families
and friends would provide such evidence, she said.
   The VA realizes there are situations where the family member is
not in the best position to make the decision, she said, and there
are times when the physician has rejected a family member's
recommendation that life-support be withdrawn.
   She noted that in many cases a patient's wishes may be better
understood by someone else, such as in the case of AIDS patients
who have been alienated from their families because of
homosexuality. Also, she said, family members may be motivated by
the desire to collect survivors' benefits.
   But Rasinski says the centerpiece of the VA policy will be the
execution of a living-will document known as a ``durable power of
attorney,'' in which patients specify their representatives and
their wishes beforehand.
   At the Long Beach hospital, incoming patients are informed of
the California state law that provides for such living wills.
   The American Legion, a major veterans service organization, has
not addressed the issue.

   A Roman Catholic assemblywoman's opponent today conceded she
narrowly won a special California state Senate election that
attracted national attention after she was denied Communion because
of her abortion-rights ads.
   In North Dakota, voters rejected all eight proposals on their
ballot.
   With all 536 of the San Diego County precincts reporting,
four-term Democratic assemblywoman Lucy Killea led her Republican
opponent, freshman Assemblywoman Carol Bentley, by 1,528 votes.
   Although 2,500 to 3,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted
this afternoon, Bentley said at a news conference that she did not
think they would make a difference.
   Without those ballots, the totals were 60,012, or 51 percent,
for Killea, to Bentley's 58,484 votes, or 49 percent.
   Killea declined to say if Bishop Leo T. Maher's Communion ban
played a key role in the race.
   ``There's no way of really judging that,'' she said. ``I don't
know how you would figure it out other than get somebody to do some
polling and I'm not going to do that.''
   Bentley said the Communion ban and abortion issue were decisive
in the heavily Republican district.
   ``What this says is that my opponent's whole strategy was to
focus this race on abortion, so people wouldn't be looking at her
liberal voting record in the state Legislature,'' she said. ``The
bishop had an incredible impact on this race. In one letter, he
created an instant international celebrity and a martyr.''
   Kate Michelman, executive director in Washington, D.C., of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, called Killea's win ``a
stunning victory.''
   ``The bishop shot himself in the foot,'' said Michelman, who was
rasied as a Catholic. ``This is not the role for religion. They
should not be getting involved in politics. ... The voters there
really rose up against what the bishop was trying to do.''
   In Northern California, a four-year legal battle to boost
Hispanic representation on Watsonsville City Council ended with
Hispanics losing three of four seats they had sought. The election
was the first under a district-vote system. Council candidates
previously were elected at large.
   In deciding the most questions on a North Dakota ballot since
1919, voters soundly defeated proposals to raise the gasoline tax,
income tax and sales tax.
   With all precincts reporting, the closest margin was on the
proposal to raise the 5 percent sales tax by 1 percent. It lost 53
percent to 47 percent.
   Gov. George Sinner pondered budget cuts and a special
legislative session today after the proposed tax increases were
defeated.
   ``I've done my best to explain what we thought was at stake,''
said the Democratic governor, who had campaigned for the tax
increases. ``Now I have to do the best I can to make it work.''
   Tax opponents, led by Bismarck businessman Kent French,
celebrated.
   ``It's people power. The people of North Dakota have spoken
tonight,'' he said.
   More than 60 percent of voters also defeated a mandatory seat
belt law; a measure to legalize video gambling machines; and a
proposed health and sex education curriculum in public schools. The
seventh measure, a proposal to allow North Dakota legislators to
join the state Public Employees Retirement System, lost by 88
percent, the unofficial totals showed.
   And a constitutional amendment calling for reorganization of the
executive branch of state government lost by 71-29 percent.
   More than 230,000 North Dakotans _ 48 percent of eligible voters
_ thronged to the polls. Robert Valeu, deputy secretary of state,
said the turnout topped the record of 212,000 in a special ballot
in July 1939 that rejected a tax increase and liquor sales in
stores.
   In San Diego County's state Senate race, Killea is the first
U.S. public official to be denied Communion by the Roman Catholic
Church because of her support for abortion rights.
   Killea has said she will not change her stance on abortion.
   The special election was held to replace the incumbent, who was
made a municipal judge.
   Watsonville's election was originally scheduled for Nov. 7, but
was postponed after the Oct. 17 earthquake, which demolished more
than 300 homes in the farming community 95 miles south of San
Francisco.
   Housing and development, which were big issues before the quake,
took on even greater importance afterward.

<HEAD>French Court Rules Author Plagiarized `Gone with the Wind'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Regine Deforges plagiarized the classic
``Gone with the Wind'' for her best-seller ``The Blue Bicycle,'' a
court ruled Wednesday, ordering her and her publisher to pay
Margaret Mitchell's heirs $333,000 in damages and interest.
   The American Trust Co. Bank, which holds the world rights to
``Gone with the Wind,'' had sought $833,000 from Ms. Deforges and
her publisher, Editions Ramsay.
   Ramsay President Franck Spengler said the company and Ms.
Deforges would appeal. The novelist was in West Germany and
unavailable for comment, he said.
   ``We feel we're innocent,'' Spengler said in an interview.
   ``The books are both great novels but they are very different,
and so are their heroines. By nature, Lea is an optimist, and
Scarlett is more Anglo-Saxon, hard-driving, determined and
power-hungry.
   ``Let's put it this way: `The Blue Bicycle' is a historical
novel smattered with psychology and emotion while `Gone With the
Wind' is a pyschological novel cloaked with history,'' he said.
   In a judgment issued by Judge Nicole Antoine, the court
concluded ``The Blue Bicycle'' constituted an ``illicit
reproduction'' of ``Gone with the Wind.''
   ``Based on a comparative study of the two works, it is clear
that what Regine Deforges borrowed from Margaret Mitchell's work
and incorporated into `The Blue Bicycle' is perfectly identifiable
and relates to the most important elements of Ms. Mitchell's
novel,'' the statement said.
   The court said Ms. Deforges copied the ``general intrigue, plot
development and narrative progression, the physical and
psychological characteristics of the major figures, the
relationships between the characters, several secondary characters,
a large number of characteristic situations, the composition and
expression of numerous scenes and key dramatic moments'' of ``Gone
with the Wind.''
   There are similarities. ``The Blue Bicycle,'' which has sold
millions of copies since it was published in 1983 as the first part
of a trilogy, is set during the Nazi occupation of France.
   Its heroine, Lea Delmas, is the beautiful, headstrong daughter
of a southern vintner. Like Scarlett O'Hara, her carefree youth is
interrupted by the horrors of war.
   The opening scenes of garden parties, pretty dresses and
breathless suitors are reminiscent of the American South. And
France, like the United States in the Civil War, is divided.
Pro-Vichy Petainists condemn Charles de Gaulle's freedom fighters.
Collaborators and militia men hunt down Jews and resistance.
   Lea sides with the underground, roaming the Bordelais
countryside on her blue bicycle carrying secret messages.
   Like Scarlett, Lea wants the one man she cannot have. Laurent
d'Argilat has married the sweet, fragile and morally upright
Camille, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Melanie.
   Deforges' French-style Rhett Butler _ Francois Tavernier _ is a
swarthy, cigar-smoking rogue who miraculously turns up whenever Lea
needs him.
   The case has been long and complicated because there are few
precedents. French law forbids plagiarism, but it does allow
pastiche, a centuries-old literary form defined as a ``humorous''
take-off or remake of a recognizable original text.
   Ms. Mitchell's heirs saw nothing funny about ``The Blue
Bicycle,'' despite Ms. Deforges repeated assertions that her novel
was meant as a pastiche.
   ``I know what plagiarism is and it's a very bad thing,'' Ms.
Degorges said when the case went to court two years ago. ``From the
beginning `The Blue Bicycle' was intended to be a pastiche. I never
said it was supposed to be anything else.''
   The court rejected her argument, saying the differences between
the two works were ``undeniably secondary and inoperative given the
extent of their similarities.''

<HEAD>Safety Board Blames Crew For Not Securing Brakes In Montana Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board today
blamed the crew of a Montana Rail Link freight train for failing to
secure the brakes before a crash and chemical explosion that forced
evacuation of 2,000 people in subfreezing Helena last winter.
   The board also cited as contributing to the accident the
decision of an engineer to rearrange the train's locomotives while
leaving the cars unattended on a mountain grade; the effects of the
cold that reached a wind-chill factor of minus-70 degrees at the
time of the Feb. 2 crash; and inadequate training by the railroad
management.
   The board, voting 4-0, issued several recommendations to the
railroad, to Burlington Northern Railroad which owned the tracks,
the Federal Railraod Administration, the Association of American
Railroads and the city of Helena.
   The independent safety board determines probable cause of
accidents and makes recommendations for improving safety but has no
statutory or police authority.
   Cars from the train, which had been making its way up a long
mountain grade en route to Spokane, Wash., coasted backwards nine
miles into Helena and hit another train and a propane tank. Flames
from the propane explosion ignited one of the derailed cars, which
contained highly flammable chemical.
   The NTSB noted that the release of hazardous materials
contributed to the severity of the 4:48 a.m. crash, in which no one
was killed or seriously injured. Damage was estimated at $6
million, not including several private homes that suffered broken
windows and other damage.
   Board investigators said the crew of the train failed to
properly secure train brakes after disconnecting cars so they could
rearrange engines that were helping the train up the long grade
toward the Continental Divide.
   The decision to move the engines was made after the heater and
then the engine failed in the lead locomotive.

<HEAD>Egypt Gives Nod To Baker Proposal on Peace Talks</HEAD>

   Egypt has agreed to Secretary of State James
A. Baker's proposals for a direct dialogue between Israel and
Palestinian representatives provided certain conditions are met,
the State Department said today.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the Egyptian
reply a ``step forward'' for the peace process. She raised the
possibility of a meeting among the Israeli and Egyptian foreign
ministers and the U.S. secretary of state early next year to work
on additional steps.
   However, it appeared there were still roadblocks to the start of
any direct talks among all the parties.
   Egypt has been working as the intermediary between the PLO and
Baker in the effort to get a dialogue under way. Its response
follows weeks of contacts between Egyptian and U.S. officials.
   Ms. Tutwiler indicated that Egypt, as Israel had done earlier,
set forth certain conditions that must be met if it is to continue
participating in the peace process.
   One such condition, based on statements over the weekend by
Palestine Liberation Organization representatives, is that the PLO
participate in selecting the Palestinian delegation for the
dialogue with Israel.
   Earlier, Israel had accepted the Baker plan on the condition
that no PLO representative take part. Israel also is demanding that
the talks be limited to Prime Minister Yithak Shamir's plan for
elections in the occupied territories. The PLO favors a dialogue
only if it deals with broader issues.
   In Israel, an adviser to Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said
Israel was waiting to see the Egyptian response in writing. Ms.
Tutwiler said Baker telephoned Arens this morning to brief him on
the response.
   ``We have now received from the government of Egypt a positive
response to Secretary Baker's five-point framework,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   ``We will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to
a trilateral meeting in Washington as part of a process for
launching an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue,'' she said.
   The key element in a five-point Baker plan accepts Israel's view
that Israeli representatives will take part in the dialogue on the
basis of Shamir's election proposal.
   Under that proposal, the Palestinians would elect
representatives to open negotiations with Israel on limited
self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Baker plan also makes a concession to the Palestinian side
in stating that Palestinian representatives at the talks would be
free to ``raise issues that relate to their opinions on how to make
the elections and the negotiating process succeed.''
   This raises the possibility, although not explicitly, of a more
open agenda in the talks than that favored by the Israelis, who
want to avoid discussion of points which are of high priority to
the PLO, such as the establishment of a Palestinian state.

<HEAD>U.S. Explorer Says Ancient Tablets May Link Solomon to Peruvian Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American explorer said Wednesday he has
found ancient stone tablets in Peru's highland jungle that may
prove the area was the site of King Solomon's legendary gold mines.
   ``We have found something that is going to revolutionize the
archaeological interpretation of Peru's ancient civilizations,''
said Gene Savoy, an explorer and historian.
   Savoy, 62, is a member of the New York Explorers Club and is
credited with discovering 40 lost cities in Peru's remote tropical
rain forests in three decades of work.
   He said in an interview the tablets contain the first writing
found from the ancient civilizations of the Andes and that the
inscriptions are similar to Phoenician and Semitic hieroglyphs.
   Peru's pre-Colombian cultures, which culminated with the Incas,
were not known to have written languages.
   Savoy said he found three tablets, each weighing several tons
and measuring about 5 by 10 feet, in August in a cave near Gran
Vilaya, the immense ruins of the Chachapoyas Indian civilization
that he discovered in 1985.
   The Gran Vilaya ruins are 400 miles north of Lima and 9,000 feet
above sea level in a fog-shrouded region of the Andes that
Peruvians call the ``jungle's eyebrow.''
   Savoy displayed photos of the tablets, which he said remain in
the cave, and sketches of rubbings taken from the stones. He
pointed out the similarities between the stylized inscriptions and
samples of Phoenician hieroglyphs.
   The hieroglyphs on the tablets are similar to those used in King
Solomon's time and include one identical to the symbol that always
appeared on the ships he sent to the legendary land of Ophir, which
the Bible described as the source of his gold, Savoy said.
   ``When I first heard about the possible contact between Egypt
and Israel and the Americas, nobody was more skeptical than I
was,'' he said. ``I thought it was absolutely ridiculous. They've
been talking about this crazy stuff for years.
   ``But now we've got stone tablets and this cannot be denied.''
   Savoy, who has written books on his explorations in Peru, said
he has studied his findings since early September and is preparing
to publish them.
   ``The tablets were not brought here from another country like
Egypt. This is a Chachapoyas form of hieroglyphic writing,'' he
said, referring to the Indian empire that once dominated the jungle
region.
   ``We're talking about something very old. It's possible the
Andean cultures ... are much older than we realize, perhaps older
than what we know as the Old World,'' Savoy said.
   Savoy said he has found ancient stone roads leading down from
the misty heights of Gran Vilaya to the river tributaries that feed
into the Amazon.
   He said the Chachapoyas ``could have used the Amazon as a
highway to the sea. And there is no reason the Egyptians or Hebrews
couldn't have used the Amazon in reverse.''
   ``This is controversial, of course,'' he said. ``But it's all
there for the doubters to see.''
   Savoy was decorated by the Peruvian Senate last week for his
contributions to Peru. He lived from 1957 to 1970 in Peru and now
resides in Reno, Nev., where he directs the Andean Explorers
Foundation.
   In 1964, in what has been regarded as his most important
discovery, he located Vilcabamba, the last Inca city.
   He discovered Gran Vilaya in 1985, which he says was the capital
of the Chachapoyas culture. The civilization reached its zenith
between 800 and 1000 A.D. and later was conquered by the Incas.

   Vice President Dan Quayle has a ``strange''
attitude toward the Soviet Union and appeared to be standing still
in a fast-moving world, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, reacting to a Quayle interview in The
Washington Post on Tuesday, said the vice president resisted
adapting to the changes taking place in the Soviet Union.
   In the interview, Quayle said, ``You're still dealing with a
totalitarian government'' that wants to ``create instability'' in
other nations. ``I don't think they've changed much in foreign
policy,'' Quayle was quoted as saying.''
   Gerasimov said the Malta summit meeting between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had improved relations to
``a qualitatively new level.''
   Quayle, Gerasimov said, ``considers it to be a mistake to treat
the meeting as a sign of change in Soviet foreign policy.''
   Gerasimov said that despite the rapid changes taking place in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, Quayle ``remains devoted to
his own beliefs.''
   ``A politician, if he is a realistically minded one, has to
assess changes in the world, to react to the new challenges of the
time,'' Gerasimov said.
   ``The remarks by the vice president, compared to other speeches
_ by the American president, the American secretary of state, the
president's assistant on national security and others _ sounded
strange,'' Gerasimov said.
   He compared Quayle to Kozma Prutkov, a character in Russian
literature who was stubbornly resistant to change. ``Like Kozma
Prutkov, this noble knight is in the same position, sitting on a
stone while the world is changing.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday announced the
formation of a task force designed to find ways to overcome what he
called ``a crisis in Hispanic education.''
   Bush told Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos the panel should
try to come up with recommendations to reduce a historically high
Hispanic school dropout rate, promote adult literacy and send more
Hispanics to college.
   In a memo to Cavazos released by the White House, Bush said
Hispanic Americans ``are especially undereducated.''
   ``As Hispanics become the largest minority group in the United
States early in the next century, it becomes more and more
important to overcome the crisis in Hispanic education,'' he said.
   Bush said that between 9 percent and 11 percent of Hispanic
students drop out of high school each year, the highest dropout
rate of any major ethnic or racial group. Among Hispanics over age
25, ``an alarming'' 52 percent have not completed high school,
compared to 21 percent of non-Hispancis, Bush said.

<HEAD>House GOP Leader Says News Media Ignore Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said
Wednesday that ``television reporting on Congress takes second
place to reporting on the president'' and few newspapers provide
detailed reporting of House and Senate proceedings.
   Michel spoke at a National Press Club luncheon during a
symposium on ``The Press and a Divided Government,'' sponsored by
the Gerald R. Ford Library and the National Press Foundation.
   Former President Ford also discussed the subject of press
coverage of a government in which Republicans control the White
House and Democrats dominate in Congress.
   ``I don't think it's hard,'' Ford said. ``All you have to do is
be fair.''
   Michel said, ``To oversimplify the issue for the sake of debate,
let's say television, with its emphasis on the personal, has become
the major presidential news medium, and print, with its ability to
describe complex issues, has become the major congressional medium.
   ``For TV evening news, with its mass audience, television
reporting on Congress takes second place to reporting on the
president,'' he said.
   ``The only time network television gives the Congress a detailed
look is when scandal erupts or if some committee is holding
hearings on some currently hot topic,'' Michel said. ``The rest of
the time we could just as well be on the moon, so far as the mass
audience is concerned.''
   The Illinois Republican told his audience, ``Print journalism
offers a bit more opportunity to go into detail. But how many
American newspapers give Congress in-depth coverage? Not many.''
   ``Aggressive press coverage of strongly held, clashing values in
a divided government would be good for America,'' Michel said.
   ``But we don't have that kind of coverage. The press in general
does a good job reporting on the foibles and the gaffes and the
slips of a president. But it doesn't provide a mass audience with
the underlying realities of Democratic control of the House.''
   Michel said that recently he and Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.,
held a news conference on the issue of House reform and added,
``After we spoke, the first question _ and most of the rest _
concerned a then-prominent House scandal. Only one major newspaper
reported our proposals for reform.''
   ``I'm not saying scandals shouldn't be covered,'' Michel said.
``All I'm saying is that the dull, workaday routine of the House,
that affects 200 million Americans, deserves equal time.
   ``So today I offer the networks and the majority of our nation's
newspapers a challenge: prove that I'm wrong.''

   The leading spokesman for Palestinians was
barred Wednesday from entering the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the Arab uprising might
last another two years.
   Troops opened fire in the West Bank town of Nablus to disperse
demonstrators, wounding eight Palestinians, hospital officials
said. Six Arabs were shot by troops in stone-throwing clashes in
Gaza, they said.
   The army imposed a curfew that will confine Gaza's 750,000
residents to their homes beginning Thursday to head off possible
protests Friday, when the uprising enters its third year. A similar
curfew was expected for the West Bank.
   Soldiers also demolished three houses of Palestinians suspected
in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.
   Palestinian spokesman Faisal Husseini, who lives in the Arab
sector of Jerusalem annexed by Israel, was banned by the army from
entering the occupied territories for six months. He accused
authorities of trying to increase tension among Palestinians in the
occupied territories.
   The army orders said the travel ban against Husseini, 49, was
taken ``for the sake of ensuring public peace, the defense of the
area and the establishment of public order.''
   A military official said Husseini was involved in ``incitement
against the authorities, against the army.'' The official, who
insisted on anonymity, gave no details.
   Husseini, a pro-PLO activist, was released from prison in
January after being held for 18 months without charge or trial. But
he has since been invited to several meetings by Israeli officials
seeking his views on peace prospects.
   Husseini said in an interview that the army action ``was not
warranted.''
   He noted that his trips to the occupied territories have largely
dealt with settling disputes among various Palestinian factions.
   ``Apparently the occupiers are looking for more fights among the
people, possibly to justify their staying there,'' Husseini said.
   In Jerusalem, Rabin told a Parliament debate on the uprising
that while the army has not succeeded in quelling the revolt, he
believed Israel eventually would convince Palestinian activists
they can gain nothing by violence.
   ``I am convinced that we mustn't under any circumstances give in
to violence and must use every path to show those that deal in
violence they will pay a heavy and painful price,'' he said.
   However, Rabin also said in remarks to soldiers that were
broadcast on Israel radio that the rebellion may last ``another
year or two.''
   At least 626 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the rebellion; 155 Palestinians have been slain by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel; and
43 Israelis have died.
   In Nablus, six protest marches involving hundreds of people
erupted during a two-hour relaxation by the army of a curfew that
has been imposed since Friday, Palestinian reporters said.
   The protesters waved outlawed Palestinian flags and chanted they
would avenge the deaths of four members of a gang called the Black
Panthers who were killed by soldiers on Friday, Arab witnesses said.
   Eight people were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers in
the city's old market, or Casbah, and the nearby Balata refugee
camp, hospital officials said. One victim was a 14-year-old boy
shot in the back, the officials said.
   The army confirmed two injuries.
   Six Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes
with Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip, hospitals reported.
   Also in Gaza on Wednesday, several hundred Israeli settlers
staged demonstrations protesting the Israeli decision to begin
admitting 5,800 Palestinians from Egypt. The Palestinians ended up
on the Egyptian side of the border when Israel returned the Sinai
to Egypt under the 1979 Camp David peace accords.
   Datya Hershkowitz, a spokeswoman for the settlers, accused
Israel of admitting people ``trained as terrorists'' during their
years in Egypt and described it as ``a birthday present for the
uprising.''
   The first to be admitted were five men and several sons, who
will build houses and then bring the rest of their families.

<HEAD>Catholic Politicians Divide Over Bishops' Abortion Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The abortion issue increasingly is being felt by Catholic
politicians straddling the divide between constituent and
conscience as they struggle to mind their church and uphold their
oaths of office.
   ``When I made this decision, I knew the church wasn't going to
stand up and applaud,'' said New York Assemblyman Herman Farrell,
who first took a stand in favor of legalized abortions in 1974.
``I'm surprised that it took them so long to bring some of this
stuff up.''
   Some of ``this stuff'' includes a California legislator being
refused Communion, banishment from a Rhode Island church newspaper
for politicians who won't take an anti-abortion oath, a statement
from the bishop's conference last month that for Catholics there is
no choice.
   But the crackdown is a relief for many Catholic lawmakers who
resent colleagues who dissent from the church's teaching on
abortion.
   ``If prominent Catholic (politicians) in Congress were to
support the pro-life cause it would certainly prevail,'' said U.S.
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   ``They should have done this a long time ago,'' said state Rep.
Ed Bybee of Hawaii.
   Leaders of the 53 million-member church last month declared ``no
Catholic can responsibly take a `pro-choice' stand,'' and said
Catholic legislators have a special moral responsibility to work
for legislation limiting legalized abortion. This came soon after
the Supreme Court gave legislatures greater authority in regulating
abortions.
   In a special California state Senate election Tuesday, Lucy
Killea won a narrow victory despite being barred by San Diego
Bishop Leo T. Maher from receiving Communion because of her
pro-choice campaign commercials.
   Her opponent, freshman Assemblywoman Carol Bentley, conceded
Wednesday she had been defeated by 1,528 votes. Although 2,500 to
3,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted, Bentley said she
didn't think they would make a difference.
   ``It's a stunning victory, a real upset, and it's on the issue
of abortion that she won,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director
of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``The bishop shot himself in the foot,'' Michelman said. ``This
is not the role for religion. They should not be getting involved
in politics.''
   Montana's bishops have asked Catholic politicians not to
publicly contradict the church on abortion, and two officials who
spoke at an abortion rights rally have been called on the carpet.
And in Providence, R.I., the diocesan newspaper told politicians
they had to sign a pledge supporting a constitutional amendment
against abortion if they wanted to advertise holiday greetings.
   ``My religion will not interfere with what I perceive to be my
role in government,'' said state Sen. Vincent Fumo of Philadelphia.
``I did not take the oath as an ambassador for the Catholic
Church.''
   Utah State Rep. Frank Pignaelli of Salt Lake City said the
church's position that no abortions are justifiable puts officials
in a no-win situation.
   ``What position does a Catholic take. If a bill comes up that
prohibits abortion except if the mother's life is threatened and
you vote for it, you are perceived as taking a pro-abortion stance.
Catholic legislators have one hell of a decision before them,'' he
said.
   Minnesota state Sen. Gene Waldorf expressed skepticism over the
attacks on the bishops' stand.
   ``I never heard anything about separation of church and state
when the bishops were talking about the poor and the hungry. It's
only when they talk about abortion,'' Waldorf said.
   Still, many politicans said the bishops' strategy will backfire
if they rely on sanctions.
   ``I think they will be very effective in keeping Catholic
legislators away from the Communion rail. As political strategists,
they leave a great deal to be desired,'' said Idaho state Sen. Mike
Blackbird.
   Ecclesiastical sanctions have been used sparingly by the church,
and with mixed results. When Sister Mary Agnes Mansour took over as
head of the Michigan Department of Social Services, Detroit
Cardinal Edmund Casimir Szoka wanted her to resign or publicly
oppose abortion. She quit her religious order. But New York
Assemblyman John Dearie changed his vote on Medicaid funding of
abortions earlier this year after being told in 1986 that he would
no longer be able to speak at parish events he'd attended since he
was a child while he supported public funding of abortions.
   While the bishops are united in their belief the church has a
role in the public policy debate over abortion, they are divided on
the value of sanctions.
   ``For me, taking into account constitutional tradition, the best
approach is one of persuasion. ... One has to wonder if such
penalties in the long run would not be counterproductive,'' said
Bishop John D'Arcy of Ft. Wayne, Ind.
   In San Diego, Killea's opponent Bentley, said the bishop's
Communion ban ``had an incredible impact on this race. In one
letter, he created an instant international celebrity and a
martyr.''

of lung cancer. He was 68.
   Pritchard died Tuesday at Seton Medical Center.
   Pritchard was among Britain's highest-paid, busiest and most
distinguished conductors and was knighted in 1983 by Queen
Elizabeth II for his contribution to British musical life.
   His last public appearance in Britain was Sept. 16 when he
conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra on the popular last night of
the annual Promenade Concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
An announcer told concertgoers that Pritchard had not been well and
he sat while conducting.
   He was chief conductor of the BBC Symphony from 1982 until
October and of the Cologne Opera in West Germany from 1978 until
this summer.
   He had been musical director of the San Francisco Opera since
1986 and held the same post at Glyndebourne, the English opera
house, and the Theater de la Monnaie in Brussels.
   He was only 31 when he was invited to conduct at the Vienna
State Opera in 1952-53 and composer Benjamin Britten chose him to
condut his 1953 opera ``Gloriana'' for Queen Elizabeth II's
coronation.
   Pritchard conducted this season's new production of Mozart's
``Idomeneo,'' a work on which he was a leading authority. Illness
forced him to cancel this fall's performances of Puccini's ``Madame
Butterfly'' and Vivaldi's ``Orlando Furioso.'' His tenure was
supposed to have ended in 1990.
   Pritchard never married. Burial will be in Sussex, England, near
Glyndebourne.
   A memorial is set for Monday at San Francisco's Grace Cathedral.

   Next month, there will be no more tomorrows for
Fox Broadcasting's ``Beyond Tomorrow'' series. But there will be a
cartoon series, the only one on a broadcast network in prime time,
the company said Wednesday.
   Fox canceled its futurist newsmagazine series. It said its new
half-hour ``The Simpsons'' will join its Sunday schedule Jan. 14,
preceded by ``America's Most Wanted'' and followed by ``Married ...
With Children.''
   ``Totally Hidden Video,'' a comedy show now airing Sundays, will
be shifted to Saturday nights on Jan. 13 to make room for the
animated Simpsons series, skits of which first aired between
segments of Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show.''
   Fox Broadcasting says it serves 126 stations.

<HEAD>Government Says Utility Discriminated Against Nuclear Plant Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear power plant worker says he feels
vindicated by a ruling that a utility discriminated against him by
firing him after he voiced safety concerns about the project.
   The Labor Department ordered Arizona Public Service Co. to
rehire William David Simmons and give him back pay. The utility
operates and partly owns the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station,
50 miles west of Phoenix.
   Simmons, 33, was fired Oct. 12 after being accused of cheating
on a training test required by Palo Verde. However, the Labor
Department said the utility couldn't substantiate the allegations.
   Simmons ``did not cheat on the exam and has been subjected to
discrimination by the employer,'' the department wrote in a Nov. 7
letter to the utility and to Simmons' attorney, Stephen Kohn.
   Kohn said Simmons earned about $100,000 a year as a
radioactive-waste technician. Simmons hasn't been rehired and
remains unemployed, Kohn told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
   Simmons, who had worked at Palo Verde since 1982, said the
finding was a relief.
   ``They attempted to destroy me and my lifestyle, and now I feel
vindicated,'' he said.``I've never been known as a liar or a
cheater. This feels good, I can tell you that.''
   Don Andrews, a Palo Verde spokesman, said Wednesday he couldn't
comment on the Labor Department ruling because it was a ``personnel
matter and any actions of the case are still in progress.''
   Andrews declined to say whether the ruling would be appealed.
   However, Kohn said the utility had appealed it, and a Jan. 9
hearing on the matter has been scheduled before a Department of
Labor judge in Washington.
   A federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman said the
agency was aware of the case and would ask APS for its account of
the incident.
   According to the Labor Department investigator's report, Simmons
was disliked by management for complaining to plant operators and
regulators about his safety concerns.
   Complaints included potential problems with sodium hydroxide
that reportedly was leaking into the surrounding water table and
that employees weren't qualified to use respirators.
   Simmons originally was faulted because he didn't attend required
training classes, but the Labor Department said plant managers
never scheduled Simmons to attend the classes.
   Eventually, Simmons was required to take the exams without
attending the training classes, investigator William Whitfield
reported. During one of those exams, Palo Verde officials said four
instructors watched Simmons look at small, yellow notes.
   However, the utility was unable to prove that Simmons had used
the notes for a test ``considered to be so easy'' that no one could
think of a reason for cheating, Whitfield wrote.
   Simmons acknowledged he brought study notes into the exam with
him but said he didn't use them.

<HEAD>White House Says Contras Shouldn't Disband</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Contras ``have no alternative'' but to
stay together as a fighting force despite a regional peace accord
requiring the Nicaraguan rebels to disband this week, the White
House said Wednesday.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Nicaragua's
leftist government has failed to live up to terms of the pact under
which the Contras were to be voluntarily repatriated.
   Under the agreement signed in August by the presidents of
Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, the
Contras were to have disbanded by Tuesday, while the Nicaraguan
government was to make democratic reforms and promote safe
conditions for them to return home.
   The Contras do not intend to demobilize because ``the conditions
do not exist in Nicaragua'' for them to return, Contra spokesman
Bosco Matamoros said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said they will continue to receive non-lethal
assistance from the United States under a bipartisan congressional
agreement that granted them a total of $47 million to last until
February, when Nicaragua is to hold national elections.
   Although the United States has cut off military aid, the Contras
have continued skirmishing with government troops, with the
fighting going on even before Nicaragua announced early last month
that it was ending a 19-month-old informal cease-fire.
   The peace plan signed by the five presidents in August at Tela,
Honduras, called for demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5,
coupled with democratic reforms by Ortega's leftist government.
   The agreement also said Nicaragua would strengthen its internal
conditions for national reconciliation, which include elections
scheduled for Feb. 25, and would encourage repatriation of the
rebels.
   However, Fitzwater told reporters, ``The circumstances there do
not fulfill the conditions of demobilization as set forth in the
Tela accords.''
   ``Nicaragua was to provide the conditions that would be
conducive for voluntary repatriation. They have not met those
obligations. The Sandinistas have broken the cease-fire, have
sought to undermine the election process by harassing the
opposition.''
   Fitzwater also said Nicaragua had denied entry to observer teams
and congressional delegations that wanted to monitor election
preparations. While Nicaragua welcomed the observer mission headed
by former President Carter, the Sandinistas have not looked kindly
on some other would-be observers.
   Reps. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., were denied visas
last week. They were representing a 20-member commission named by
President Bush to observe election preparations. But the Sandinista
government said the group would not be admitted because it was not
independent.
   ``In view of this situation, the Contras have no alternative,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   Cease-fire negotiations were suspended Nov. 21 after the Contras
refused to go along with a Sandinista demand for a partial
withdrawal of rebel forces to base camps in Honduras.
   The Contras declined to go beyond a pledge not to infiltrate
more troops from base camps in Honduras.
   The Sandinistas contend 2,300 Contras have infiltrated from
Honduras into Nicaragua over recent weeks.
   Their operation from base camps along the Honduran border, where
some 6,000 rebels are encamped, has been a bone of contention
between Honduras and Nicaragua.
   The Contras blamed the Sandinistas for suspension of the talks,
saying the rebels were willing to continue efforts to work out an
agreement. Matamoros underscored that offer on Wednesday.
   But Sandinista representatives maintained it was the consensus
of all sides involved in the talks that were held in Washington
that negotiations were at an impasse.

   Lithuania's parliament Wednesday fell nine votes
short of changing the republic's constitution to legalize multiple
political parties, the first threat to the Communist Party's
constitutionally guaranteed supremacy in the Soviet Union.
   The 219-1 vote was shy of the 228 needed for the two-thirds
majority, but 84 deputies were absent and 30 abstained. The
parliament will vote again on the issue Thursday, said Eduardas
Potashinskas, an activist who watched a live television feed of the
session in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.
   Also on Wednesday, the Armenian legislature failed to draw a
quorum large enough to consider a similar constitutional change,
said activist Karen Shakhbazyan in Yerevan.
   In Moscow, green photocopied cards appeared Wednesday in subway
stations and main streets calling for a two-hour general strike
Monday to ask the Congress of People's Deputies to rescind the same
provision in the national constitution.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and five fellow members
of the Soviet legislature signed the appeal.
   Article 6, which became part of the basic law of the Soviet
Union with the Constitution drawn up by Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1977,
makes the Communist Party the ``leading and guiding force of Soviet
society.'' Eliminating it would help reduce the party's grip on on
all spheres of life.
   Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Hungary recently
dropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting special
status to their Communist parties.
   ``Democracy is impossible with the kind of government with a
constitution, that sets the inequality of parties, and the
inequality of people who are their members,'' Lithuanian deputy
Albertas Laurinchukas told his fellow deputies, according to
Potashinskas.
   Sakharov and his fellow deputies are calling for the general
strike Monday to pressure the national Congress into rescinding
Article 6 and voting on draft laws on land, property and business
enterprises. Congress starts its second semiannual session Tuesday.
   The government newspaper Izvestia refused to publish the
deputies' call for the general strike, said Sakharov's wife, Yelena
Bonner.
   ``It is of great importance that Article 6 of the Constitution
be abandoned,'' Sakharov was quoted as saying by the Soviet news
bulletin Interfax. ``We cannot afford to bob in the wake of changes
that are taking place in Eastern Europe.''
   In Czechoslovakia, the parliamentary action was preceded by a
similar symbolic strike. Czechoslovak strike organizers publicized
their plan through massive demonstrations, wall posters, and direct
organizing at factories.
   There has been little publicity in the Soviet Union on
Sakharov's suggestion thus far, so the Izvestia publication would
have been invaluable.
   Still, Bonner said, ``The whole country already knows about this
appeal.''
   She said documents calling for the strike were distributed at a
conference in Moscow on Dec. 2 attended by representatives of
Voters' Clubs from 60 cities around the Soviet Union. The appeal
also was announced at the conference of Russia's Front, she said.
   Shakhbazyan said he had seen no publicity on Sakharov's strike
call in Yerevan, located 1,100 miles south of Moscow.
   Sakharov was quoted by Interfax as saying that dropping the
provision from the Soviet Constitution ``is extremely important in
checking the crisis of confidence in the country.''
   He said that if the laws on property, land and business
enterprises are not considered at this session of the Congress,
they cannot be approved until the next session, six months away. At
the least, he said, the constitutional provisions standing in the
way of certain reforms should be changed.
   The Supreme Soviet working legislature is supposed to hammer out
new laws, but its parent body, the larger Congress, must approve
any changes in the Constitution. The Congress meets just twice a
year.
   The Supreme Soviet voted last month to place consideration of
Article 6 on the congressional agenda, but the proposal failed by a
narrow margin.
   The Congress is the centerpiece of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were elected in
March in the country's first competitive elections in more than 70
years.

   Leaders of the Chinese democracy movement
opened a five-day planning session Wednesday to blunt criticism
from the Chinese-American community that they are disorganized.
   ``Our goal is to overturn one-party rule by the Communist Party,
not to overthrow the Communist Party. We want to use peaceful,
non-violent measures,'' said Yan Jiaqi, chairman of the Front for a
Democratic China.
   The Front is an umbrella organization of the Chinese democracy
movement that has been criticized by Chinese students and residents
in the United States as lacking focus.
   ``We have delegates from England, Australia, Hong Kong, France
and the United States. They have all come to decide our future
work. It's a very important meeting,'' Yan said.
   Subjects on the agenda included how to separate personal
finances from money donated since the student uprising was crushed
by Chinese authorities in Baijing's Tiananmen Square in June.
   Wu'er Kaixi, one of the student leaders in Tiananmen Square now
on a one-year fellowship at Harvard, has in particular been
criticized by the Chinese-language press in the United States for
allegedly confusing his personal finances with the front's finances.
   Representatives from Chinese communities around the world were
to report in an effort to lay out a specific program for the
group's long-term operation.
   An afternoon, closed-door meeting Wednesday was to consider
relations with Taiwan.
   ``We cannot accept Taiwanese independence. Taiwan is part of
China. But we have to decide our policy towards Taiwan's
democratization and the changes taking place there,'' Yan said.
``We want to go to Taiwan and see the situation. We can't go from
the mainland.''
   Wan Runnan, founder and former president of a Peking-based
computer firm and general secretary of the FDC, has planned an
exploratory trip to Taiwan to speak with members of various
political groups, including the independent opposition party that
was formed in the last few years, Yang said.
   He said the FDC was not thinking about siding with any
particular group in Taiwan since FDC members include active members
of Taiwan's ruling party, the Kuomintang, as well as former members
of the Communist Party.
   Another item to be addressed was the FDC's policy toward Tibet.
   The Chinese government has claimed sovereignty there since the
13th century. Tibetans claim to have a different culture and say
they should be independent from Chinese rule.
   Yan met this week in Paris with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled
religious leader, to propose a solution for the problem. It
involved forming a federation so that Tibet's relationship with
China would be more like a state, Yan said.
   Yan, who said he offered the proposal on behalf of the FDC, said
the Dalai Lama offered no response.
   FDC leaders said they would present a position when their
meetings end Sunday.

<HEAD>Raid in Colombia Leads to $61.8 Million in Secret Bank Deposits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department froze $61.8 million
that a man accused of being a leading Colombian drug trafficker
kept in five nations by tracing financial records seized in a raid,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Wednesday.
   Authorities froze bank accounts kept for Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha in this country, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria and Britain
after Drug Enforcement Administration agents followed a paper trail
left by the records, Thornburgh said.
   The financial and property records were seized by Colombian
police during an October raid of a home owned by Rodriguez's nephew
and turned over to DEA, Thornburgh said.
   Rodriguez, one of the three leaders of Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel, is among the 12 Colombian drug traffickers most wanted by
the Justice Department.
   He faces drug-trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering charges
in Florida and New York.
   ``While Mr. Rodriguez Gocha remains at large, he has been shorn
of substantial assets provided by the illegal activiites with which
he is charged,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``This is not laundered money, this is part of Gacha's personal
financial net and we have taken that $61.8 million from Gacha and
his family as part of his personal assets,'' said DEA administrator
Jack Lawn.
   Lawn said the records showed that Rodriguez had given $81
million to be invested on his behalf by Mauricio Vives, a Colombian
associate who is at large.
   DEA was able to trace all but $20 million, which was transferred
into banks in Panama, Lawn said.
   Vives had invested Rodriguez's money in certificates of
deposits, high-yield stocks and other financial instruments that
were kept on deposit in the banks, Lawn said.
   ``What we were dealing with is a highly sophisticated
money-moving operation,'' Thornburgh said. ``These were not funds
that were being laundered, they had found a home.''
   The operation was first disclosed Nov. 7 in congressional
testimony by Terrence M. Burke, the acting deputy DEA
administrator. At the time, Burke declined to dislose the name of
the drug figure whose assets were frozen.
   Lawn said the records seized from the home of Alfonso Rodriguez
Munoz may enable DEA to trace the assets of other cartel figures.
   The attorney general credited unprecedented international
cooperation by Colombia and the other nations that helped DEA
quickly trace the funds and freeze bank accounts kept for Rodriguez
containing certificates of deposit, stocks and other financial
instruments.
   ``The timeliness of the asset information provided by the
government of Colombia, its completeness and the speed of
transmittal were examplary,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``Swift and decisive action, not bureaucratic delay, was the
order of the day,'' Thornburgh said.
   The attorney general declined to identify any of the banks where
Rodriguez kept his money. But Thornburgh said none of the financial
institutions was under investigation.
   Authorities in Luxembourg froze 10 accounts containing $39.4
million and obtained another $2 million that had been stashed over
the border in West German banks.
   Also frozen were accounts containing: $10.3 million in
Switzerland, $5.9 million in Austria, $4.2 million in Britain and
$2 million in this country, Thornburgh said.
   The Justice Department has initiated forfeiture proceedings for
the money kept in the U.S. accounts. Justice Department spokesman
David Runkel said he expected some the $2 million will be shared
with the Colombian government. The rest will go into the U.S.
Treasury.
   It was not clear how much of the money in foreign banks would be
forfeited. The Justice Department said the laws of the four other
nations would determine how authorities in those nations would
dispose of the money.

   A 3-year-old boy stabbed by an assailant who
killed his mother spent three days trapped next to her body in a
bathroom until help arrived, authorities said Wednesday.
   The boy, Christopher Hunt, was taken by his mother into the
bathroom in a vain attempt to escape her killer, police said.
   The child was stabbed five times before his mother, 20-year-old
Kimberly Hunt, herded him into the small room of their apartment.
The woman apparently was trying to lock the bathroom door when the
attacker shot her in the head, said Detective James Gildea.
   ``The mother fell against the door,'' and the boy was unable to
open it, said a police sergeant who identified himself only as E.
Adorjan.
   The woman's mother, former fiance and the apartment custodian
found the child next to her body Monday after she failed to report
to work at an insurance agency, authorities said.
   Police said they believe the attack took place Friday or
Saturday.
   Christopher was in good condition Wednesday at Children's
Memorial Hospital, said spokesman Dan McCarthy.
   ``The first thing he said was, `I'm hungry,''' said Estelle
Jarden, Ms. Hunt's mother.
   Though seriously wounded, Christopher helped police identify a
possible suspect, Gildea said.
   ``He said, `That's the man that hurt me and mommy,''' when shown
a photograph of one of his mother's friends, the detective said.
   Police are seeking the suspect, Adorjan said.

   Who could predict that little boys would go crazy
over Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or that little girls would fall
in love with Cabbage Patch dolls?
   Mark Kellerman gets paid to try.
   As senior toy buyer for one of the nation's largest retail
variety franchisers, Kellerman spends hours figuring out what toys
will be hits with kids and which ones will end up gathering dust
under the bed.
   His decisions _ based on visits to toy shows, scrutiny of
manufacturers' advertising spending and playing with the toys
himself _ help determine financial success for Ben Franklin variety
stores, where toys are big business.
   Ben Franklin, founded in the 1920s, operates 1,300 stores
nationwide.
   How can a 41-year-old balding, bearded businessman know what
kids want?
   ``You've got to be a child that's never really grown up, you've
got to love the product, you've got to love to play with it,''
Kellerman said Wednesday in an interview from his office in
suburban Carol Stream.
   He also relies on advice from his son, who was 12 when Kellerman
started in the business four years ago and now has inside
information on what older kids want.
   But Kellerman is the first to admit that getting inside the
mercurial mind of a child isn't easy.
   ``Why is Ninja Turtle popular and Master of the Universe, no one
wants anymore?'' he said.
   ``I will see probably 100 new toy lines each year. Which ones
will sell, which ones won't is probably anybody's guess.''
   Hits this Christmas include thimble-sized vehicles called Micro
Machines, Nintendo video games and Barbie, whose popularity is
grounded in tradition, Kellerman said.
   Toys based on television or comic-book cartoon characters, like
the Ninja turtles and Ghostbusters action figures, are frequently
big hits.
   Those based on movie characters _ like Batman _ often enjoy big
but short-lived success, he said.
   Kellerman said he looks for toys that will have more long-term
appeal.
   Due to the nature of the manufacturing business, products are
promoted to buyers long before they go on store shelves. The
American International Toy Fair in New York, where buyers go to get
ideas for what their stores will offer at Christmas, is held months
earlier, in February.
   ``That's the hardest part of the job _ looking at an item in
March, and trying to decide what a 7-year old will want in seven
months,'' Kellerman said.
   In the toy business, ``demand ends rather abruptly,'' he said.
   Take Cabbage Patch dolls.
   Five years ago, they were the status symbol of the sandbox set.
Stores couldn't keep them in stock. But they became passe as their
owners aged and financial problems plagued the manufacturer, Coleco
Industries, Kellerman said.
   But Hasbro Inc. took over the Cabbage Patch license and is
spending millions of dollars to revive them, he said, predicting:
``Cabbage Patch will make a comback next year.''
   Toy manufacturers love that kind of talk, and depend heavily on
buyers like Kellerman.
   ``Buyer reaction is critical not only in terms of placing
orders, but their input can change a product. They might make a
suggestion that could determine the success of a product,'' said
Jody Levin, spokeswoman for Toy Manufacturers of America, the
industry trade group in New York.
   ``Buyers are the first link with consumers,'' she said.
   Kellerman is one businessman who takes his work home. He has
several toys of his own, include a collection of radio-controlled
vehicles.
   ``There's some great concepts, great engineering on some of
these things,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Composer Sammy Fain, a two-time Academy Award
winner who wrote ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   Fain died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical Center, said Ken
Sunshine, a publicist for the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most enduring pop
hits of American music this century.
   His collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Paul Francis Webster, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg
and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing
You,'' ``Wedding Bells are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and
``Tender Is the Night'' among them.
   Fain won his Academy Awards for best song, in the title for the
1955 film ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' and in 1953 for
``Secret Love'' from the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.'' Fain was
nominated for Oscars nine times during his career.
   He was born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902. A
piano prodigy, he unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with lyricist Kahal for their first hit ``Nobody Knows What a
Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in musical films, then returned to
Broadway and wrote songs for the smash review ``Hellzapoppin'' in
1938.
   Two songs from another failed Fain musical that same year,
``I'll Be Seeing You,'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I'' later became
wartime classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Fain and Hilliard wrote all the songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice
In Wonderland,'' including the tune ``I'm Late.''
   Fain also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's
``Peter Pan.'' After winning his ``Secret Love'' Oscar, Fain
collaborated to write the theme songs for several movies besides
the second Academy Award winner ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing.''
   Those included ``A Certain Smile,'' ``April Love,'' ``The Gift
of Love'' and ``Tender Is the Night.''
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
his lifetime achievement of writing popular music.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>CBS Lures Angela Lansbury Back For Another Season</HEAD>

   The suspense is over. Angela Lansbury has
agreed to return for a seventh season in CBS's highest-rated
entertainment show ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   Miss Lansbury had not planned to return for the 1990-91 season,
but CBS reached an agreement for next season, Howard Stringer,
president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said Tuesday.
   ``Murder, She Wrote,'' in which Miss Lansbury plays mystery
novelist Jessica Fletcher who keeps happening upon murders, is CBS'
only hit entertainment show. Usually, Miss Lansbury's show and ``60
Minutes'' are the only CBS shows to make the 20 top shows in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   Her return is so important to CBS that the network has granted
her enormous concessions. The new agreement calls for Miss
Lansbury's production company to develop a series for next season
that she would not appear in.
   To get her to return for the current season, CBS financed the
establishment of her production company and said she only had to
appear in 13 episodes. She makes brief appearances in nine other
episodes, which are essentially pilots for other series.
   That contract also calls for her company to produce several TV
movies and 13 episodes of a half-hour series starring Miss Lansbury
after ``Murder, She Wrote'' ends its network run.
   Her husband, Peter Shaw, and son, David Shaw, run the production
company, Corymore Productions Inc. Another son, Anthony, is a
frequent director of ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   Miss Lansbury said in a recent interview that she wanted to quit
the show, but that CBS was anxious for her to return.
   Regarding her return for this season, she said, ``They made me a
wonderful offer. It was a very difficult decision. I really had
made up my mind to leave. It's very hard to walk away from success
and a loyal audience. They gave us an opportunity to set up a
production company to make a series, with or without me. They were
interested in any project I wanted to do.''
   Asked then if she would continue the show next season, she said,
``CBS would like to continue it indefinitely. I'm the fly in the
ointment. It takes a lot of courage to stand up to that. People
around me don't make it easy.''

   Left- and right-wing politicians battled
Wednesday over whether to ban two songs by pop stars about the
Palestinian uprising from state-run radio and television.
   Right-wing members of the Broadcast Authority's administrative
committee pushed through a ban of ``A Kid Alone,'' by Chava
Alberstein, and ``The Flood Can Come After Us'' by Nurit Galron,
arguing the songs were ``PLO-like and could damage the morale of
the state.''
   But after the 4-2 vote Tuesday, the ban was delayed for two
weeks pending an appeal by left-leaning members of the committee,
said Vered Lyon, spokeswoman for Education Minister Yitzhak Navon.
The Broadcast Authority is part of the Education Ministry.
   Shlomo Kor, deputy chairman of the administrative committee, is
leading the fight for a ban. ``This is not just music, these are
political views,'' he said.
   ``These songs are against our nation, why do we have to
broadcast them?'' added Kor, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak's
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   Aharon Harel, chairman of the committee, said the effort to ban
the songs ``marches the broadcast authority into the dark ages.''
Harel is, like Navon, a member of the left-leaning Labor Party.
   Ms. Lyon said Navon planned to hold a hearing on the songs in
two weeks and would bring the issuebefore the full Broadcast
Authority or the Parliament.
   Ms. Galron vowed to fight the ban, saying she believed it was
part of an effort to keep information about the uprising from the
public.
   ``In the beginning they tried to cover our eyes, now they are
trying to gag us,'' she told the daily Maariv.
   In ``The Flood Can Come After Us,'' already banned on Israel's
armed forces radio, Ms. Galron accuses Israelis of indifference to
the violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip:
   ``No, don't tell me about a little girl who lost an eye.
   ``It only makes me feel bad.
   ``I don't like hearing about people oppressed or tortured.
   ``I don't care what is happening in the territories.
   ``We will make love and live our lives. Tel Aviv is life.''
   Ms. Alberstein was overseas and unavailable for comment. Her
song ``A Kid Alone'' is a modern version of a traditional song
describing the oppression of the Jewish people.
   Alberstein sings the almost 1,000-year-old song in the original
Aramaic language and then adds in Hebrew:
   ``How long will the wave of violence continue,
   ``Chasing and chased, beating and beaten?
   ``When will this madness stop?''

   Nearly a year after a bomb blew apart Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland and killed 270 people, little has been
done to improve airport security worldwide, according to a report
published Wednesday.
   Paul Wilkinson, the author of the report and an expert on
international terrorism, said obsolete security measures cannot
detect modern plastic explosives used by terrorists.
   ``We are way behind in taking the necessary measures that will
help to prevent this kind of tragedy happening again,'' said
Wilkinson, a professor at Scotland's University of St. Andrews.
   ``Another Lockerbie could happen tomorrow,'' he said at a news
conference.
   Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
All 259 people aboard the New York-bound flight and 11 on the
ground were killed.
   Investigators have said a bomb containing powerful plastic
explosives was concealed in a radio-cassette player packed in a
suitcase in the Boeing 747's forward hold.
   The flight originated in Frankfurt and passengers and baggage
transferred to a larger plane at London's Heathrow Airport.
   A Department of Transport spokesman declined to comment on the
specific allegations in the report but said: ``Since Lockerbie, we
have taken a large number of security measures relating to both
aircraft and airports.''
   The spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the
measures include tightened security involving the handling of cabin
and hold baggage and cargo on U.S. airlines operating here and
tightened security and pass requirements at all airports.
   Wilkinson's report said airlines, airports and governments all
are responsible for improving airport security.
   It said more people have been killed in airport and airplane
bombings in the past five years than in hijackings over the past 50
years _ 1,059 compared with 638.
   ``Many passengers do not apparently realize that aviation
terrorism acts now vie with technical failure and pilot error as
major causes of fatalities in civil aviation,'' the report said.
   In the poor countries of Africa and Asia, security ``is no more
than cosmetic,'' with airports often lacking equipment and trained
staff, Wilkinson said.
   Even in wealthy countries such as the United States, airports
are ``full of major security loopholes,'' he said. Passengers are
poorly screened, if at all, and not all baggage is accompanied by
passengers, he said.
   He said sophisticated machines capable of detecting colorless,
odorless plastic explosives are being tested in the United States
and should be refined and installed at airports without delay.
   Wilkinson said the continuing lack of preventive measures was
demonstrated on Sept. 19 when a UTA French airliner exploded over
Niger's Tenere Desert, killing all 171 people on board.
   ``The disaster had all the hallmarks of an African Lockerbie,''
he said. Wilkinson said intelligence and police agencies have
failed to coordinate counterterrorism strategies, sometimes because
of rivalries.
   ``This has become all too evident in the welter of international
confusion and recrimination over the international hunt for the
Lockerbie bombers,'' he said.
   Scottish and West German police have denied published reports of
poor cooperation in their hunt for the bombers.
   Wilkinson said one major lesson from the Lockerbie crash is the
need to stay one step ahead of terrorists.
   ``When terrorists find it harder to plant bombs on aircraft they
are likely to turn to other tactics such as shooting them down with
surface-to-air missiles,'' he said.
   ``In an age of terrorism, when aviation will continue to be an
attractive target of high publicity value to the terrorist, we can
never afford to relax our vigilance.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi was quoted
Wednesday as saying he would give Gen. Michel Aoun, the rebellious
army commander he fired, two weeks to leave the presidential palace
peacefully.
   Leaders of the Nationalist Front, a loose alliance of
Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions, called for a general
strike Thursday to protest ``Aoun's attempts to partition Lebanon.''
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic like the general, said Moslem army
units under Gen. Emile Lahoud, the new commander, were preparing a
plan to invade the Christian enclave where Aoun is entrenched and
dislodge him if necessary.
   Soldiers loyal to Aoun fought Syrian-backed Moslem militias
Wednesday for a second day in Beirut and hills above the city.
Police reported one person killed and three wounded.
   The independent newspaper An-Nahar quoted Hrawi as saying in an
interview: ``I'm giving goodwill mediators a week or two to produce
fruitful results.''
   But he stressed that he will not ``compromise regarding unity of
the legal authorities.''
   ``The presidential palace in Baabda has become a symbol that
should not be given away to anyone,'' Hrawi said.
   He said: ``I and the government will soon rule from Baabda,'' an
eastern suburb.
   In another interview published by the Kuwaiti daily Al-Qabas,
Hrawi was quoted as saying: ``I prefer to reach the Baabda palace
carrying an olive branch, but otherwise it will be by the canon.''
   Both interviews were conducted at an army barracks in Ablah in
Syrian-controlled east Lebanon, where Hrawi has set up temporary
headquarters pending a settlement with Aoun.
   Aoun commands 20,000 soldiers deployed in the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave north and east of Beirut. Lahoud has won the
allegiance of the 22,000 Moslem soldiers based in regions policed
by Syria.
   Syria maintains 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate. The Syrians, who control 70 percent of
Lebanese territory, fought a six-month war with Aoun's troops
earlier this year.
   Aoun, named head of an interim military cabinet last year, has
rejected a peace plan approved by Lebananese parliament members in
October. He says it should have set a specific timetable for
withdrawal of Syrian forces and has refused to yield the
presidential palace.
   The parliamentary accord cleared the way for election of Rene
Mouawad as president, who was killed by a bomb after 17 days and
replaced by Hrawi.
   The Syrian-backed Hrawi, in a statement distributed by his
office, said Wednesday he was ``against partition and determined to
achieve national reconciliation.''
   ``We are determined to re-unify the nation,'' he said.
   ``I have instructed the new army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud,
to prepare himself for entering east Beirut,'' Hrawi said.
   In another development, three people were killed and five
wounded Tuesday when a masked man opened random fire with an
automatic rifle at pedestrians in the Palestinian refugee camp of
Ein el-Hilweh in south Lebanon, police said. The attacker escaped,
and his motives were unknown.

   The Finnish exchange student who was
moved to a new family in a different town to get him away from his
American girlfriend is back with her in the town he considers home,
but at the cost of his sponsorship.
   ``I really do like these people here _ they're so friendly
people,'' Iiro Lehtinen said Wednesday.
   The Education Foundation for Foreign Study transferred Lehtinen,
18, of Kiriviem, Finland, from his host family and school in
Farmington to South Portland, Maine, on Nov. 11.
   The foundation said he was spending too much time with his
girlfriend, Kelly LaPointe, and not enough with his host family.
   ``I really like her very much. She's ... I can't find the
words,'' said Lehtinen.
   On Tuesday, after much media attention and protests by the
teen-agers' parents, friends and the Finnish Embassy, the
foundation released him from the program so he could return to
Farmington.
   Lehtinen said he will remain in Farmington for the rest of the
school year with Lou and Rod Waldron, who offered to take him in.
   ``I've never seen Iiro smile so much in my life,'' LaPointe, 17,
said Wednesday. She and her parents drove to South Portland to pick
Lehtinen up Tuesday night. ``We were going to go in the morning,
but he said `come now.'''
   ``I'm glad it's over and I'm glad he's coming home. He considers
Farmington his American home,'' she said.
   Their forced separation had led to a walkout by about 100
Farmington high school pupils, about one-third of the student body,
and angered the couple's parents.
   ``It was a very big headache and I'm not sure exactly why,''
said Meg Holliday, the foundation's eastern regional director in
Cambridge, Mass.
   Lehtinen's parents likely will be reimbursed for the money they
gave the foundation to pay for his expenses. Holliday said the
financial details have not been worked out. Lehtinen will get
another type of visa under the Waldrons' sponsorship.
   Holliday said Lehtinen was taken off the program after officials
spoke with his parents in Finland and agreed that his goals had
become incompatible with the program's.
   Lehtinen's father had lobbied the Education Foundation's offices
in Finland in an effort to get his son returned to Farmington.
   Lehtinen said his father, architecht Kimmo Lehtinen, hopes to
visit him in Farmington, just down the street from the LaPointe
house, sometime before Christmas.
   State Rep. William Tsiros said he got the good news late Tuesday
from Holliday.
   Tsiros said an attache at the Finnish embassy in Washington had
been angered when she learned about the transfer earlier.
   ``She said she was going to call the Education Foundation
officials and was very irate at the whole situation,'' Tsiros said.
``I don't know what she said, but it worked. I got the call from
Meg Holliday a few hours later.''
   The relationship between LaPointe and Lehtinen began in
September. Foundation officials said Lehtinen was not told to break
up with LaPointe, but only to cool the relationship enough so he
could spend more time with his host family.
   Susan Jackson, the foundation's regional coordinator in Berwick,
Maine, said many aspects of an exchange experience, including the
student's temporary ``adoption'' by an American family, were
overlooked as the story of thwarted young love took on a life of
its own.
   ``I feel confident that the foundation made the right decision,
but unfortunately that has become secondary in the eyes of the
press to the marketability of a love story,'' she said.
   According to Jackson and Holliday, Lehtinen's original host
parents in Farmington, Mike and Diane Crowley, would not see much
of him for days at a time. They said he would leave early in the
morning for school and return late at night, more like a boarder
than a temporary family member.
   ``The families are volunteers and they expect and perhaps
deserve some interaction with the student they are harboring,''
Holliday said.

   The Supreme Court entered the wrenching
``right to die'' controversy Wednesday as lawyers clashed over
whether to permit the withdrawal of life-sustaining nutrition from
a 32-year-old comatose Missouri woman.
   William Colby, a lawyer for the parents of Nancy Cruzan, told
the justices that if the woman were ``lucid for a moment and could
come before this court,'' she would ``choose liberty'' and ask for
removal of the feeding tube. But, he said, the woman will never
recover.
   Assistant Attorney General Robert Presson of Missouri countered
that Ms. Cruzan's parents have no right to precipitate their
daughter's death _ particularly without ``clear and convincing
evidence'' she would choose to die.
   Letting her die ``goes against the state's interest in
preventing suicide,'' he said.
   The hour-long argument over legal doctrine came in the first
``right to die'' case the court has agreed to decide. No ruling is
expected for several months.
   The justices, who recently have been reluctant to expand
individual rights, gave no clear signals on the likely outcome of
the case as they peppered the lawyers with questions.
   The woman's parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, attended the
hour-long argument session with another daughter and two
granddaughters, and he later said, ``It certainly was a very
painful thing to sit through.''
   The parents want the high court to overturn a Missouri Supreme
Court ruling that bars removal of the feeding tube that is keeping
their daughter alive. The state court dismissed statements Ms.
Cruzan was said to have made about not wanting to remain alive in a
vegetative condition.
   An estimated 10,000 people in this country are being kept alive
in a similar manner.
   Colby said a surgically implanted tube bringing food and water
into the woman's stomach should be removed.
   Ms. Cruzan ``is an unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers
for the rest of her life,'' he said. ``All thought and ability to
react with the world around her is gone. She will never recover.''
   He said if Ms. Cruzan ``was lucid for a moment and could come
before this court,'' she would ask for removal of the feeding tube.
   ``Her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in
this case,'' the lawyer said. ``She would choose liberty.''
   However, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Colby, ``You presume
there is a liberty to die without clear and convincing evidence''
of the patient's wishes.
   On the other hand, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Missouri's
assistant attorney general whether he thought the Missouri Supreme
Court _ which barred removal of the feeding tube _ based its ruling
on ``the best interests of the patient?''
   ``I have been concerned because it's not clear to me what
standard the Missouri Supreme Court set,'' she said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia said if the court were to decide there is
a right for parents to decide between life and death for an
incompetent offspring wouldn't that ``lead inevitably to a right
for the state to decide'' as well?
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the Bush administration's top
courtroom lawyer, argued that states should be given ``wide
latitude to develop approaches that reflect, reasonably, the values
of the people ... in this highly sensitive and deeply vexing
situation.''
   A high court ruling is expected by July. Even if the justices
decide there is no constitutional right to die, or that it cannot
be exercised by a parent or guardian of an incompetent person,
states will remain free to let doctors remove life-sustaining
treatment from certain patients.
   But such a ruling might prompt lower courts to make it more
difficult for physicians and family members to terminate treatment.
   Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a car crash nearly
seven years ago and is in what doctors call a permanent vegetative
condition.
   Her body is rigid, her hands and feet constricted and bent into
claw shapes. She can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are
open and move randomly.
   Doctors say she could live for 30 years or more in her current
condition unless the feeding tube is removed.
   The right-to-die issue attracted national attention in 1976 when
the New Jersey Supreme Court allowed the family of Karen Ann
Quinlan to order removal of a respirator helping her breathe. Ms.
Quinlan, in a similar coma-like state, continued to be fed through
a tube and lived for nine more years.
   American courts since generally have permitted removal of
life-sustaining treatment for such patients.
   The American Medical Association estimates 70 percent of
Americans at some time will be involved in a decision about whether
to provide life-sustaining medical care for themselves or family
members.
   Forty-one states, including Missouri, have ``living will'' laws
that allow people to pre-authorize the termination of
life-sustaining treatment. Missouri's living-will law, which does
not allow for removal of feeding tubes, was not in effect when Ms.
Cruzan was injured.

   Swiss police said Wednesday they were
holding Severo ``Junior'' Escobar, said to be among the top
Colombian drug traffickers.
   He is a nephew of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, alleged head of the
Medellin cartel, the most powerful drug gang in Colombia.
   His father, also named Severo, was given a 30-year prison term
in the United States in 1984 on conviction of smuggling 2,200
pounds of cocaine into the country.
   A police official, who would not let his name be used, confirmed
reports that the 30-year-old Colombian was arrested Nov. 29, but
would not provide details.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Ursula Riedel said Swiss
authorities had yet to receive extradition requests for Escobar,
described in news reports as the top Colombian trafficker in Europe.
   Escobar and four Colombian companions were arrested in a midday
raid on a hotel in Lugano, on the Swiss-Italian border, where they
had spent two months, the French-language newspaper Tribune de
Geneve reported.
   It said police seized 6.6 pounds of pure cocaine, described as a
sample of a planned delivery of 440 pounds destined for the Swiss
and Italian markets.
   La Vanguardia, a Spanish newspaper published in Barcelona, said
Severo Escobar's network brought huge loads of cocaine from Spain
for other European markets. It described his capture as a major
blow to the Medellin cartel.
   The police raid followed seven months of investigations in
Switzerland, Spain, the Netherlands and West Germany, Tribune de
Geneve said. Police confirmed that 12 people were arrested in those
countries.
   According to Tribune de Geneve, police seized nearly 1,000
pounds of cocaine with a street value of up to $75 million
   Mario Calderon, another key suspect in the Colombian cocaine
trade, was among those arrested, the paper said. Police declined
comment.
   Calderon was captured in September in connection with the
seizure of 825 pounds of cocaine Sept. 20 in Stuttgart, West
Germany, the paper reported. It said two Swiss policemen posed as
truck drivers and drove the drugs from Hamburg, the arrival port,
to Stuttgart.
   Five people were arrested Oct. 5 in Yverdon, western
Switzerland, Tribune de Geneve said.
   It also reported the arrests Nov. 29 in Madrid of a member of
the Cali cartel, another Colombian drug gang, and a Colombian who
allegedly helped amass several tons of cocaine in Spain.
   A spokesman for the Lugano prosecutor's office said Swiss
authorities had applied for the extradition of two Colombians held
in Spain. He refused to give details.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston on Wednesday called on FBI
Director William Sessions to look for a government source for a
news story saying the bureau is investigating a voter registration
group operated by the senator's son.
   ``It makes my blood boil to see attempts to smear my son and
drag him into the mud,'' the California Democrat said in a
statement released at his office. He also urged an investigation of
a Republican-financed voter registration group.
   ``Leaks must not be tolerated among those who are responsible
for law enforcement,'' Cranston said. ``Leaks undermine our legal
system.''
   Cranston's statement came in response to a published report that
federal law enforcement authorities were investigating the Center
for Participation in Democracy, operated by Cranston's son, Kim.
   The investigation is aimed at determining whether the tax exempt
group sought to register more Democrats than Republicans, according
to the report which appeared in Wednesday editions of the New York
Times.
   Cranston said in his statement that his son ``has the highest
ethical standards I have ever known in anyone.''
   ``I know personally from Kim of the exquisite pains he took to
ensure that registration drives he was associated with were legal,
proper and bipartisan,'' said Cranston.
   Cranston and four other senators already were under fire for
intervening with federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln Savings
and Loan of California while receiving substantial campaign
contributions from Charles Keating Jr., who headed the institution.
Keating also contributed to Kim Cranston's voter group.
   Fred Reagan, a spokesman for the FBI in Los Angeles, refused to
comment on whether the bureau is conducting such an investigation.
   But documents released by the House Banking Committee, which
conducted hearings into the failure of Lincoln S&amp;L, show that
California officials turned over to the FBI material relating to
the voter registration groups.
   Richard Newsom, an examiner for the California Department of
Savings and Loan, provided the FBI office in Santa Ana, Calif.,
with copies of documents such as state forms declaring the Center
for Participation in Democracy a charitable trust.
   Meantime, Rob Giannangeli, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue
Service in Los Angeles, also said he could not comment on whether
there was an investigation of the voter registration groups.
   ``If in fact the FBI is investigating the Center for
Participation in Democracy, I suggest that it not limit is
investigations to groups alleged to be seeking to register
potential Democratic voters and that it look into
Republican-inspired registration groups as well,'' Cranston said.
   ``I also suggest the press likewise make its investigations
evenhanded and bipartisan,'' he added.
   He called for an investigation to determine ``what motivated Joe
Rodgers, who was chairman of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984, to
found Americans for Responsible Government, which in 1985 became
Vote America.'' He described the group as ``a Republican-supported
non-partisan voter registration organization.''
   ``How much money did he raise for Vote America or related
registration efforts? And from whom?'' Cranston asked.
   He also called for an inquiry into any connection between
``Republican-inspired registration drives'' and conservative groups
such as the Moral Majority, the American Coalition for Traditional
Values, the American Christian Voice Foundation, the American
Defense Foundation and the Responsible Government for America
Foundation.
   Cranston said his voter-registration efforts ``were motivated by
a simple principle: The health, indeed the very future, of our
democracy depends on the fullest possible voter participation by
all segments of our population.''

   Jury deliberations began Wednesday in the
manslaughter trial of a Hispanic policeman accused of firing on a
motorcycle and killing two black men, setting off three days of
racial violence.
   Rumors swept the city that Officer William Lozano had been found
innocent or was about to be found innocent, court officials said.
Dade County's highest-ranking state judge went on live television
to deny them.
   The jury, which got the case after almost seven weeks of
hearings and testimony, adjourned for the day at 6 p.m. after
deliberating for nine hours. Deliberations were to resume Thursday.
   Lozano, 31, faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of
motorcycle driver Clement Lloyd, 23, and his passenger Allan
Blanchard, 24.
   The rumors caused some downtown office workers to leave work
early, court officials said.
   In the unusual live television appearance, Dade Chief Circuit
Judge Gerald Wetherington called for calm.
   ``There is no reason for concern on the part of anybody in the
community,'' Wetherington said. ``There is no indication there will
be any verdict tonight.''
   The judge revealed that the trial judge, Circuit Judge Joseph
Farina, may seal any verdict and delay announcing it for an
undetermined time.
   Innocent verdicts for police officers accused of killing Miami
blacks have touched off violence twice before in this decade.
   But Mayor Xavier Suarez and other officials expressed hope that
the presence of two blacks on Lozano's jury would demonstrate the
process was fair, whatever the verdict.
   Prosecutors say Lozano fired unnecessarily when Lloyd on his
motorcycle fled a police car after a traffic violation. Lozano said
he fired in self-defense when Lloyd tried to run him down.
   Deliberations were delayed for almost an hour after prosecutors
discovered a typographical error in jury instructions given Tuesday.
   The written copy in the jury's hands omitted the word ``or''
between two prosecution theories _ that Lozano committed an
intentional act or was guilty of culpable neglgence. The written
copy made it appear prosecutors had to prove both, not just one,
said Chief Assistant State Attorney John Hogan.
   The judge, over the objections of defense attorneys Roy Black
and Mark Seiden, agreed to insert the word in the jury's written
instructions, then denied Seiden's motion for a mistrial. The judge
said the defense had the option of appeal in case of a conviction.
   The courtroom was sealed so the jurors could deliberate there
because the extensive evidence would not fit in the small jury
chamber.

<HEAD>Arabs Drop Bid for Recognition of PLO As a Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Arab nations on Wednesday withdrew their
bid to have the PLO recognized as the ``provisional government of
Palestine,'' which had prompted a U.S. threat to cut off
contributions to the world body.
   A face-saving compromise was played out on the floor of the
General Assembly to spare the sponsors the embarrassment of losing
a vote on the resolution.
   Assembly President Joseph Garba of Nigeria urged on Tuesday that
the resolution be withdrawn, and the Arab delegations met Wednesday
morning and agreed to ``respond positively'' to the appeal, the
Arabs announced.
   In the afternoon assembly session, Garba said ``consideration is
indeed postponed'' and banged his gavel, ending a two-week wrangle.
   In Washington, State Department officials said the Bush
administration was pleased with the outcome.
   Arab members expected success when they began the effort to have
the General Assembly recognize the Palestine Liberation
Organization as a non-voting member state.
   As a member of the 102-member Non-Aligned Movement, the PLO
appeared to have more than enough support in the 159-nation
assembly.
   Its representatives now sit at the side of the assembly chamber
as observers. The PLO sought elevation in rank to a non-voting
observer state, such as North and South Korea, Switzerland, San
Marino, Monaco and the Vatican.
   The State Department countered with a threat to halt U.S.
payments if the PLO's status was raised. The United States is
assessed $216 million annually, one-fourth of the U.N. budget.
   European nations began seeking a compromise and support for the
PLO waned.
   In the 22-member Arab group, Egypt and Morocco refused to
co-sponsor the resolution. The Soviet Union lobbied against it,
depriving the PLO of its usual Warsaw Pact support.
   Many Third World nations wondered whether recognizing the PLO as
a government was a principle worth the loss of U.S. funds.
   In November 1988, the PLO declared an independent state of
Palestine, to be located in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. It claims more than 80 nations have recogized the new state.
   The United States and many Western governments have not extended
recognition, on grounds the Palestinian state does not have
specific borders or a functioning government.

   The Peace Corps is heading to Eastern Europe for
the first time to help Hungary cope with rapid changes that are
creating a need for volunteer teachers, the agency's director said
Wednesday.
   The U.S. agency expects similar requests from other East bloc
countries, including Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, for instruction
on everything from health care to business administration, Director
Paul D. Coverdell said.
   Talks already are under way with Poland, he said.
   ``There's an enthusiasm that's almost unbridled about American
aid. It's almost euphoria,'' Coverdell said. ``There's an intense
desire to understand American institutions.''
   Coverdell said 65 Peace Corps volunteers will be sent to Hungary
to teach English. Poland has requested English teachers,
environmental instructors and help with small business
administration.
   Coverdell visited Poland and Hungary in October to discuss the
volunteer assistance. Peace Corps staff members will arrive in
Hungary in January, with volunteers expected in June after three
months' training in cultural affairs and language.
   Coverdell was in Denver to promote the agency's new World Wise
Schools program, which has former Peace Corps volunteers sharing
their knowledge with students about countries in which they've
lived.
   The Peace Corps, founded in 1961, relies on volunteers who spend
two years helping the people of other countries meet basic needs
for health care, food, shelter and education.
   Jim Flanigan, spokesman for the agency in Washington, said the
Peace Corps has 6,300 volunteers in 66 of the world's 170
countries, or about one-third.
   Coverdell said more than 2,000 people have signed up in recent
months for assignments in Eastern Europe.
   Volunteers in Hungary will have to subsist on $100 a month and
live the same Spartan lifestyle as Hungarians, Flanigan said.
   ``Once you get out of the facade of downtown Budapest, people
are living different lives,'' he said.
   Flanigan called the new assignments exciting and challenging.
And he said the Peace Corps does not fear ejection once in Eastern
Europe by any new governments that might be set up.
   ``We're on the crest of a wave,'' he said. ``It's important we
be there now and seize the moment.''
   Coverdell said East bloc countries are having a difficult time
adjusting to political reforms brought on by massive, pro-democracy
demonstrations in East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and
other countries.
   Problems that the Peace Corps can help with stem from a poor
infrastructure rather than a lack of knowledge, he said.
   ``The health delivery system infrastructure is suffering great
difficulty,'' Coverdell said.

   The Communist premier agreed
Wednesday to name a new Cabinet including members suggested by a
popular opposition that rejects the current government. He said he
would quit unless the crisis is resolved.
   Opposition leader Vaclav Havel said Premier Ladislav Adamec
agreed to deliver a list of ministers Friday. The two had a long,
tough negotiating session Tuesday and a brief meeting Wednesday.
   Adamec, confronted by mass disapproval when he chose a new
government Dec. 3, said on television after Havel's news conference
he would resign if the political crisis continued. The opposition
has threatened a general strike Monday if he does not have a new
government.
   CTK, the official news agency, said Adamec accepted a list of
possible candidates from Civic Forum, the non-Communist opposition
group Havel leads, and would consult with other official political
parties.
   It quoted him as saying he probably would meet with Civic Forum
again Friday. Adamec said on television he had talked with Civic
Forum and other groups, ``but I don't know if we will reach
agreement as far as changes are concerned.''
   His television address indicated there had been tough bargaining
with the opposition. He said it was difficult to persuade
professionals favored by the opposition to join the Cabinet in a
fluid political situation where the public mood ``changes from day
to day and hour to hour.''
   Unless the situation calms and the government wins public
confidence, Adamec said, he would have no choice but to step down.
   ``If the government does not have these conditions, I cannot
take any responsibility for what happens,'' he said. ``In this
case, there is only one honest solution for me: to ask the
president of the republic to let me resign.
   ``I feel sorry that, in the event I resign as premier, I won't
be able to help the society to overcome the crisis,'' he added. He
did not give a time frame for deciding whether to stay in office.
   A CTK dispatch said the Politburo of the Slovak republic's
Communist Party resigned in advance of a special Slovak party
congress scheduled for Dec. 17. The Czech republic,
Czechoslovakia's other region, has a new government with a
non-Communist majority.
   Havel said Communist Party chief Karel Urbanek, who held a
75-minute meeting with him Wednesday, agreed with the opposition
that ``young, able people and experts who are not discredited''
should be brought into the government.
   Opposition leaders want such an ``interim government'' to create
the legal base for parliamentary democracy and hold free elections
in July.
   Czechoslovakia has moved rapidly toward democracy since brutal
police repression of a student demonstration Nov. 17 started a mass
pro-democracy movement and anti-government protests.
   In two weeks, the Communists have relinquished their 41-year
monopoly on power, reversed 21 years of hard-line policy on the
Prague Spring reforms of 1968 by condemning the Soviet-led invasion
that crushed them, and said free elections are likely next year.
   Adamec named a new Cabinet last Sunday, but included only five
non-Communists and left Communists in charge of key ministries.
   At his news conference, Havel refused to disclose details of his
negotiations with Adamec. Opposition sources said some form of
power sharing was envisioned, but whether that would lead to a
government led by non-Communists, as in Poland, was not clear.
   On Tuesday, the first government with a non-Communist majority
chosen in Czechoslovakia in 41 years was named to lead the Czech
regional administration. Communists retained the leadership and
deputy leadership of the government, along with the interior
ministry and key economic posts.
   Jiri Dienstbier, Civic Forum spokesman, called the new Czech
government ``a step in the right direction.''
   In Washington, the State Department said the latest developments
give reformers in the Communist Party ``a chance to demonstrate
statesmanship by working with Civic Forum and the Czechoslovakian
people to lay the foundation for political reform and a transition
to true democracy.''
   The Urbanek-Havel meeting was the first between the Communist
Party chief and the opposition leader, who only a month ago was a
banned, dissident playwright reviled in the official press. Havel
said Urbanek admitted his party faces ``deeply rooted mistrust''
and must change.
   Urbanek also assured the opposition the party paramilitary
force, the People's Militia, had been disarmed by the army and
probably would be absorbed into the armed forces.
   The opposition also wants the secret police disbanded. Havel
said Urbanek acknowledged the secret police ``has lost all its
purpose for internal matters,'' but whether it would be dissolved
was not clear.
   As the session ended, Urbanek was heard telling actor Milan
Knazko, the opposition leader in Slovakia: ``The most important
thing now is to calm people's emotions so that we don't have a food
rationing system tomorrow.''
   That indicated the Communists want to resolve the political
crisis before it affects the economy and supplies of consumer
goods, which are fairly plentiful compared with the rest of Eastern
Europe.
   On Tuesday, the opposition won another victory when a
parliamentary commission investigating the brutality Nov. 17 named
ousted party chief Milos Jakes and former Prague party boss
Miroslav Stepan as ``politically responsible'' for it.
   Naming those responsible was among the main opposition demands.
On Wednesday, the opposition also demanded new public prosecutors
be chosen for both the federal system and Czech region.

   Third World loan losses at big New York banks
and souring real estate markets in the Northeast and Arizona pushed
commercial banking into the red last summer for the first time in
more than two years, the government said Wednesday.
   The nation's 12,824 banks lost $744 million in the
July-September quarter, off sharply from $7 billion in profits in
the second quarter and $7.3 billion in the first three months of
the year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.
   For the first nine months, banks earned $13.7 billion, almost $5
billion less than same period of 1988.
   The third-quarter loss was the first negative quarter since
banks lost $10.6 billion in the April-June period of 1987. That
loss was also caused by large banks writing off developing country
debt.
   Meanwhile, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman issued a new and
more pessimistic assessment of prospects for the insurance fund
backing bank deposits up to $100,000 per account, drawing criticism
from Congress.
   He said the fund will shrink between $250 million and $500
million this year to about $13.8 billion, posting the second loss
in its history. The fund declined by about $4 billion in 1988 when
bank failures hit a post-Depression record of 221. This year, bank
failures should top 200, but miss breaking last year's record, he
said.
   In September, Seidman had predicted his fund would break even or
post a slight loss. Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions, said the new
estimate shows the FDIC should be more aggressively regulating
commercial banks.
   Annunzio likened Seidman to outgoing savings and loan regulator
M. Danny Wall, who endured grueling criticism from Congress for
underestimating the scope of the S&amp;L crisis.
   ``Bill Seidman should have spent more time doing his job at the
FDIC instead of running around the country telling everyone what a
bad job Danny Wall was doing,'' Annunzio said in a prepared
statement.
   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Annunzio's charge was ``simply
not true,'' adding that Seidman's only public criticism of Wall has
been for the S&amp;L regulator's decision to shift the supervision of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif., from regional
examiners in San Francisco to examiners in Washington.
   Economist Robert Litan of the Brooking Institution, a Washington
think tank, said if banks' unrecognized losses are taken into
account the FDIC probably has reserves closer to $9 billion than to
$13 billion.
   Seidman has disputed that assessment, but, Litan noted, ``He's
moving closer to reality.''
   The FDIC chairman said he revised his assessment of the
insurance fund because of growing bank losses on real estate loans
for commercial development and condo projects. He urged banks to
exercise more caution in the area.
   Although bank profits overall likely will bounce back in the
final three months of 1989, the number of sour real estate loans
will continue to rise, he predicted.
   ``I don't want to Scrooge up Christmas ... but I'm afraid the
fourth quarter will show a continuation of the (real estate) trends
we see here,'' Seidman said.
   Over the last 12 months, real estate loan growth has accounted
for nearly two-thirds of all bank asset growth, and now comprises
almost one-fourth of all commercial bank assets.
   Delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sour
loans nationally, he said. In the Northeast, the percentage of
delinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year, he said.
   The states with the highest percentage of bad real estate loans
at the end of the third quarter were Arizona, 12.28 percent; Texas,
10.53 percent; Alaska, 10.40 percent; Oklahoma, 6.07 percent;
Louisiana, 5.81 percent; Massachussets, 4.76 percent; New Mexico,
4.24 percent; Connecticut, 3.85 percent; New York, 3.78 percent and
New Hampshire, 3.69 percent.
   However, the problems in the oil-producing states have been
long-standing and are improving. Markets in the Northeast continue
to deteriorate.
   The concentration of third-quarter losses shows the influence of
write-downs for developing country debt. Five of the nation's 10
largest banks accounted for $5.3 billion loss.
   Banks in four states loss money: New York, $5.7 billion;
Arizona, $333 million; Texas, $219 million, and Louisiana, $7
million. Banks in 46 states, Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia reported earnings.
   Private analysts predicted that several other large banks, most
notably Citicorp, could add to Third World debt loss reserves in
the next few quarters. They said banks' real estate portfolios
would continue to deteriorate and that bank loans for leveraged
buyout deals would begin to show up as losses.
   ``The real estate problem is serious and is dragging what were
once considered rather pristine regional banks down into the muck
with Texas institutions,'' said economist Paul Getman of the Wefa
Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.

   Mudar Badran, the new prime minister,
announced a Cabinet on Wednesday that does not include the
fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood Movement, the largest bloc in
Parliament.
   Badran named the 23-member Cabinet after three days of arguments
with Brotherhood leaders who demanded they be assigned six key
portfolios, including that of education, which is of particular
importance in the Arab world.
   Instead, Badran, 55, serving as prime minister for a third time
since 1976, chose six moderate Islamists with no ties to the
Brotherhood. Islamists are independent, very religious and advocate
Islamic influence in society but do not follow a particular party.
   Islamists were assigned the ministries of agriculture, justice,
religious affairs, planning and health. A sixth was made state
minister for parliamentary affairs.
   The Brotherhood said it should have one-fourth of the Cabinet
posts because its candidates won 25 seats last month in Jordan's
first parliamentary elections in 22 years. Independent Islamists
won nine seats in the 80-member chamber.
   Badran kept the defense portfolio for himself, and chose Marwan
Kassem and Salem Massade, deputy prime ministers, for foreign
affairs and interior respectively.
   Other appointments included Youssef Mubayideen as justice
minister, Mohammed Hamdan for education and Ziad Fareez to head the
Industry and Trade Ministry and Ibrahim Izz-Eddine as information
minister.
   Abdul Munem Abu Zant, a leading Brotherhood deputy, told The
Associated Press: ``We have a strong presence in Parliament and we
have the right to dictate our condition on the shape of the
government.''
   Other Brotherhood sources said the group had sought the
education, works, social development, labor, higher education and
information portfolios.
   That would have given the group, which advocates stricter
Islamic laws, control over ``the direction of future generations''
in the Western-oriented country, a political analyst commented.
   ``The most important ministry for the Islamic line is the
Education Ministry to safeguard this generation and the future ones
from the diminishing Islamic ideologies and social behavior in view
of pluralism of non-Islamic thought and ideologies,'' Abu Zant said.
   By law, the new Cabinet has to appear before Parliament for a
vote of confidence within 30 days. If approved by a simple majority
of 41 votes, the government will be installed. If not, King Hussein
will have to name a new prime minister.
   In all, there are 13 new faces in the government. Ten served in
previous governments and six held posts in the outgoing Cabinet of
Zeid Bin Shaker.
   Shaker resigned Monday in accordance with the constitution,
which requires the Cabinet that oversaw legislative elections bow
out once Parliament is installed.
   Badran's government includes six members of Palestinian origin,
down from seven in the previous, 24-member Cabinet of Zeid Bin
Shaker.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill Requiring Parental Consent For Teen Abortions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unmarried girls under age 18 would have to
get parental permission before obtaining an abortion in Michigan
under a bill passed Wednesday by the House despite the governor's
promise to veto it.
   Before passing the measure by a 65-39 vote, lawmakers rejected
nearly 50 amendments, including one to require boys to take some
responsibility for preventing teen-age pregnancy by wearing condoms.
   The Senate, which already has passed a similar measure, is
expected to take up the legislation before it breaks for the
holidays next week.
   That sets up a promised veto by Gov. James Blanchard, who has
pledged to strike down any measure restricting abortion rights.
   William Kandler, a spokesman for Blanchard, said the governor
wouldn't change his mind despite a survey by The Detroit News that
suggests Michigan residents favor a parental consent requirement by
a 3-1 margin.
   ``I'm hopeful the governor will think about parents and not his
own personal beliefs,'' said Barbara Listing, president of Right to
Life of Michigan.
   Margy Long, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Michigan,
said she was encouraged by at least 40 signatures collected on the
House floor asking the governor to veto the bill.
   That is more than enough to sustain a veto in the 109-member
House, although the anti-abortion side says it has enough votes for
an override in the Senate.
   The Legislature has overridden only one veto in the past 38
years, that in 1977 on a obscure administrative rules bill.
   The legislation allows a girl to petition a probate court to
have an abortion if she believes she can't tell her parents or if
her parents refuse to let her have an abortion.
   Only two substantive amendments were successful during the
lengthy floor debate.
   One would require schools to provide information about the law
and tell girls how they could seek a judge's permission for an
abortion.
   The other would allow a psychologist or psychiatrist who has
been treating the child to petition the court on her behalf if they
believe the girl would commit suicide if she couldn't obtain an
abortion without telling her parents.
   Opponents of the bill say it's merely intended to make it more
difficult for girls to get an abortion, because at least 70 percent
of pregnant minors in Michigan already bring at least one parent to
an abortion clinic with them.
   Rep. Maxine Berman said the bill might encourage girls in tragic
situations to resort to desperate measures.
   ``This bill is meant to put the squeeze on teen-agers with no
regard to the horrible alternatives they may seek,'' said Rep.
Maxine Berman. ``Can any of you live with yourself if a woman
resorts to a back-alley abortion, or to crack cocaine to induce
abortion, or to suicide? I don't want any more young people to
die.''
   ``We're talking about the very bedrock of our society, family,''
countered Rep. Michael Griffin, sponsor of the bill. ``We recognize
there are families in trouble, that's why we put the judicial
bypass in there.''

   President Francois Mitterrand of France
met with Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday and sounded a note of
caution later about German reunification.
   He flew to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital 465 miles south of
Moscow, for a six-hour working visit and talks with Gorbachev about
the political changes in Eastern Europe. The Soviet president
briefed Mitterrand on his two-day Malta summit with President Bush.
   Mitterrand later told a joint news conference West Germany must
be more firmly anchored to its European partners.
   ``The evolution of the East must lead the West toward its own
structures,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said he and the French president had a ``substantial
discussion'' on the future of Germany, which divided into two
nations after World War II.
   On Tuesday in Moscow, Gorbachev told the West German foreign
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the Soviet Union regards East
Germany as a ``faithful ally, important guarantor of peace and
stability in Europe.'' In Kiev, he said Mitterrand's visit had not
changed his view.
   The Soviet position has been that the existence of two Germanys
has helped stabilize Europe since the war.
   In restating it, Gorbachev said: ``Any artificial prodding and
pushing of this question (German reunification) could only make the
processes taking place more difficult.''
   He did not rule out the possibility of a unified German in the
future, but said the issue was ``not topical'' now.
   Mitterrand holds the revolving chairmanship of the 12-nation
European Community. He has voiced support for the possibility of a
united Germany, but on Wednesday seemed to say West Germany should
participate in moves the French leader champions for a more united
Western Europe.
   ``The most urgent question is to strengthen the European
Community,'' Mitterrand said. ``This will establish a new element
in the European reality.''
   He has pushed for a federal Europe that would tie the economies
of Common Market nations closer together through monetary union by
the mid-1990s, and eventually a single currency.
   Germany invaded both France and the Soviet Union in World War
II, and Mitterrand said current German rulers must consider the
opinions of other European nations on the reunification issue.
   It is premature now to think of redrawing boundaries, he said,
and appeared to give Gorbachev a pledge that France would seek
restraint from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on German
confederation.
   ``We should refrain from anything that would poison a quite
complex situation,'' he said. ``I have confidence in the German
leaders.''
   Mitterrand backed Gorbachev's proposal, made last Thursday, for
an all-European summit in 1990 to speed integration of the
Continent and eliminate East-West divisions.
   Gorbachev also said his meeting with Bush was a ``major world
event'' in an increasingly dynamic dialogue between East and West.
   As the leaders spoke, more than 1,000 Ukrainian nationalists
gathered outside on Lenin Square behind police barricades carrying
banners reading, ``Down with censorship'' and ``Free all political
prisoners.''
   A Soviet official said the meeting was held in Kiev because it
is an hour closer to Paris by plane.

   Charlton Heston played Moses again, parting
the waters of a fountain, and 25 high school bands blared show
tunes as thousands of culture lovers celebrated the Music Center's
25th anniversary Wednesday.
   ``Who is on the Lord's side, let him come to me!'' the bearded
Heston thundered from a podium, holding aloft the ``real stick'' he
used to part the Red Sea in the classic film ``The Ten
Commandments.''
   The masses packing the Music Center plaza cheered as walls of
water rose up on either side of the plaza's central sculpture.
   ``It worked,'' Heston said.
   The birthday celebration was held exactly 25 years after the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion opened on Dec. 6, 1964, with Zubin Mehta
conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Jascha Heifetz as the
soloist.
   The $34 million center was completed in April 1967 with openings
of the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre, giving a home to
performing arts in a city maligned by denizens of colder climes as
a cultural wasteland.
   The seven-acre center was built at the civic center with $20
million in private donations raised by Dorothy Buffum Chandler and
$14.5 million covered by a lease agreement with Los Angeles County.
   In contrast to the formal opening night years earlier, the
throng of noon revelers feasted on birthday cake and drank cartons
of milk under a brilliant 80-degree sky that Heston, in Moses tone,
took credit for.
   The round Mark Taper Forum was dressed like a birthday cake
complete with red candles sticking out of the roof. Visitors took
tours and the Mark Taper offered a free performance of Truman
Capote's ``A Christmas Memory.''
   The high school bands, led by a unit of the University of
Southern California band, played the title song from ``The Phantom
of the Opera'' and ``Seventy Six Trombones'' from ``The Music Man.''
   Actress Carol Channing, introduced to the strains of ``Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend,'' presented her ``diamond awards'' to
Peter Schabarum, president of the county Board of Supervisors, and
Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Center Theatre Group at
the Mark Taper.
   ``All good work is rewarded with diamonds,'' said Miss Channing.
   She recalled how she and the company of ``Hello Dolly'' broke
its original Broadway engagement to perform at the new Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion.
   ``It was one of the thrills of our lives,'' she said.
   The story triggered a memory for Carolyn Allen, a 10-year Music
Center employee in the crowd who had gone to that engagement of
``Hello Dolly.''
   ``I stood eight hours in line for a ticket. Then I sat on the
very top row of the balcony,'' she said, expressing disbelief it
had been so long ago.
   Construction began on the elegant, 3,197-seat Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion in March 1962, and was finished 2{ years later.
   The 742-seat Mark Taper opened on April 9, 1967, with ``The
Devils,'' starring Frank Langella and Ed Flanders. The 2,071-seat
Ahmanson opened three days later with Ingrid Bergman, Arthur Hill
and Colleen Dewhurst in ``More Stately Mansions.''
   In addition to the Philharmonic and Center Theater Group, which
develops experimental works at the Taper and classical dramas and
comedies at the Ahmanson, other companies are the Music Center
Opera, Joffrey Ballet LA-NY, Los Angeles Master Chorale and the
Music Center Education Division.

   ``The problem is already finished,'' said Brig. Gen. Arturo
Enrile, the head of the Philippine Military Academy who negotiated
all night with rebel leaders. ``We all agreed that if they returned
to the barracks ... it would be good.''
   The rebel decision to end their occupation of Makati came about
midnight, Enrile said.
   He said the government agreed to treat the rebels ``humanely,
justly and fairly,'' but added that they would ``suffer the
consequences'' for launching the sixth coup against Mrs. Aquino
since she came to power in February 1987.
   ``In other words, their political demands and other demands were
not entertained,'' Enrile told reporters early Thursday.

   The National Commission on AIDS said the
nation's health care system needs urgent repair to deal with the
crisis and underscored that point Wednesday by sending its report
to the White House eight months early.
   ``A series of problems have resulted in a health care system
singularly unresponsive to the needs of HIV infected people,'' the
commission said in its report to President Bush.
   The commission said that because infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, appeared initially in ``groups
often shunned by the larger society,'' including homosexuals, the
poor, minorities and intravenous drug users, the national response
to the AIDS epidemic has been slow.
   The commission cited a lack of training support for primary care
physicians to treat people with HIV infection and AIDS, and
financial disincentives for physicians to treat Medicaid and other
poor patients.
   ``The commission believes it is time to match rhetoric with
action,'' said the report by the panel created by Congress to
advise the president and Capitol Hill on AIDS issues.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, who as secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services sits as a non-voting member of the commission,
did not participate in writing the report and a spokesman for
Sullivan took issue with the report's criticism of national
leadership it says is lacking.
   Spokesman Jim Brown said Sullivan has expressed concern about
some of the same issues addressed by the commission's report.
However, Brown said, ``there has been leadership from this
department and there will continue to be.''
   Brown cited among the department's AIDS activities education
programs, drug research at the National Institutes of Health and
federal funding under Medicaid to treat people with AIDS.
   But the report said more needs to be done.
   ``It is essential that everyone be afforded early intervention
and access to care,'' the report said.
   The report estimated that direct medical care for people with
AIDS in 1991 will cost from $2.5 billion to $15.1 billion. It notes
the range is from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of total
health care spending in the nation, and adds, ``We simply must be
prepared to make these expenditures.''
   Dr. David Rogers, vice chairman of the commission, said these
costs are affordable. ``I think we've done a disservice to say
these are astronomical costs and that we can't handle them. Of
course we can,'' he said.
   The commission was required to draft its first annual report by
August 1990. But, in a letter to President Bush accompanying the
report, commissioners said testimony they heard at their public
hearings ``was so compelling we felt it is vital to write to you
now.'' Copies of the report were also given to leaders of the House
and Senate.
   Federal health officials say 112,241 cases of AIDS have been
reported in the United States since June 1981, and 66,493 of them
have died.
   More than 1 million Americans are believed to be infected with
HIV now, and the commission said that over the next four years,
AIDS is likely to claim 200,000 lives.
   ``The HIV epidemic is not just a New York City or a San
Francisco problem as some would like to believe,'' the report said.
   Though those cities continue to have a heavy load of AIDS cases,
by 1991, experts estimate that 80 percent of new AIDS cases will
come from outside those two cities, the report said.
   The epidemic is infecting a disproportionate number of blacks
and Hispanics and is expected to take an increasing toll on women
and children in coming years, the report said.
   While new drug treatments can prolong the lives of people with
HIV infection and AIDS, ``scientific breakthroughs mean little
unless the health care system can incorporate them and make them
accessible to people in need.''
   The commission cited a 1987 survey that showed nearly one
quarter of all AIDS patients have no form of insurance, private or
public.''
   Additionally, those on Medicaid run into barriers because low
reimbursement rates are a disincentive for physicians to treat
Medicaid patients, the report said.
   ``For example, a new patient intermediate office visit in New
York City is compensated by Blue Cross at $78, by Medicare at $80
and by Medicaid at $7,'' the report said.
   What's needed, the commission said, is ``frank recognition that
a crisis exists in many cities that will require extraordinary
measures to overcome.''
   The panel recommended creation of a ``flexible, patient-oriented
comprehensive system of care, closely linking hospital, ambulatory,
residential and home care.''
   The report also says the administration should consider creating
regional centers to provide back-up and consultation to primary
care physicians treating AIDS patients.
   It also calls for creation of units for treatment of HIV
patients who are also drug addicts. Commission members also
expressed ``surprise and disappointment'' that the White House
National Drug Control Strategy gives little attention to the
problem of AIDS spread by IV drug users sharing needles.

   A man bleeding from a head wound
stumbled across broken pavement, through smoke from fires started
by the most powerful bombk since a wave of terrorism by drug
traffickers began.
   He was too stunned to cry for help and rescue workers were too
busy with more serious cases to assist the victim, one of hundreds
injured in a bombing that claimed 35 lives Wednesday.
   The violence sometimes has overwhelmed the ability of this
nation to cope. Rescue workers were pushed beyond their capacities
this time, so the wounded man went unattended.
   There were more serious cases. The truck bomb outside the
headquarters of Colombia's secret police injured hundreds of people
and wreaked havoc in a five-block area.
   Police helicopters swooped down. While rescue workers ran with
stretchers to damaged buildings, some pedestrians strolled quietly
past blackened shells of cars twisted by the power of the blast.
The body of a passenger lay unnoticed, sticking out partly onto the
roadway.
   People ran behind ambulances or waited against hattered facades
of buildings for rescue workers to find their relatives in the
rubble.
   One man stood crying beside a heap of bent metal while firehoses
hissed and smoke climbed into the air. He was beside what was left
of a hardware store belonging to his 26-year-old daughter and his
son-and-law, who were in the building at the time of the blast.
   When firemen pulled out the remains of his daughter, burned and
mangled, the man raised his hands over his head.
   ``Patricia, my little girl, Patricia!'' he screamed. He repeated
the name, over and over.
   Moments later, a stretcher passed with the body of his
granddaughter. Her patent leather shoes extended from a bloody
sheet. His son-in-law's body came out next.
   Shock turned to anger for some onlookers.
   ``How could anyone think of negotiating with those monsters?''
one man said. Some Colombians have said negotiations with drug
traffickers are the only way to end such violence.

   Enrile said that the rebels began to leave their positions from
several high-rise buildings in the financial district of this
capital and should be out of the area by late morning. They were to
be taken to the Philippine Army's headquarters at Fort Bonafacio
about 12 blocks away.
   It was not clear if Enrile's announcement marked the end of the
coup, because rebels on Wednesday still held the Mactan Air Base in
Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila. At least 79 people have been
killed and 570 others wounded since Friday.
   The surrender came one day after about 1,800 foreigners,
including more than 200 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-held
luxury hotels in Makati and Mrs. Aquino declared a national state
of emergency to deal with the crisis.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin described as a
``great step forward'' on Wednesday the acceptance by Egypt of a
Middle East peace plan offered by U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Rabin said Baker and the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt
should meet quickly to determine the composition of a Palestinian
delegation for peace talks with Israel and the agenda of such talks.
   ``I bless it. ... I see the positive Egyptian response as a
great step forward, toward the implementation of the Israeli peace
plan,'' Rabin said, speaking on Israel Television.
   The State Department announced Wednesday it had received a
``positive'' response from Egypt. Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler raised the possibility of a trilateral meeting in
Washington early next year to work on details.
   ``We will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to
a trilateral meeting in Washington as part of the process for
launching an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue,'' she said.
   Baker's framework calls for a preliminary dialogue in Cairo,
Egypt, between delegations of Israel and the Palestinians so as to
advance the Israeli-offered plan of elections in the occupied West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   In other Middle East developments Wednesday:
   _Kurt Waldheim, president of Austria and former
secretary-general of the United Nations, ended a three-day official
visit to Tunisia after brief talks with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
on the prospects for peace in the Middle East. Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization is headquartered in Tunis.
   _President Hafez Assad repeated Syria's support for a
U.N.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace conference, despite U.S. and
Israeli efforts to arrange more limited negotiations. His comments
came in a meeting in Damascus with former U.S. Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance and former Undersecretary Richard Murphy, who are on a
study tour of the region.
   Rabin, of the left-leaning Labor Party, said of Egypt's
acceptance, ``The moment Egypt, in addition to Israel, gave a
positive reply, there is no obstacle, and we should not examine
their response as we won't agree to them examining our peace
initiative.
   ``The moment the answer is positive in principle, we should move
forward toward the meeting of three ministers who should determine
the composition of the Palestinian delegation and what will be on
the agenda.''
   His comments contradicted an earlier statement by Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yosef Amihud, who said Israel first wanted to
see a written version of the Egyptian response to examine it.
   The discrepancy could be explained by ideological differences
between Labor and the hard-line Likud bloc of Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Labor favors a territorial compromise with the Palestinians and
is ready to offer concessions. Likud views the occupied lands as an
integral part of Israel.
   Rabin, contrary to Likud's stand, indicated he did not oppose an
indirect PLO role in the process, saying:
   ``Today there are three partners to the move, Egypt, Israel and
the United States. Whomever one of them talks to, it's their
business.''
   Rabin expressed hope Likud would not torpedo the negotiations.
   Many problems remained unresolved even after Egypt's acceptance
of Baker's peace framework.
   Ms. Tutwiler indicated that Egypt specified some conditions, as
Israel had done earlier. She said that ``in their responses, both
Egypt and Israel have conveyed certain views and positions on this
process.''
   Israel accepted the Baker plan but sought U.S. guarantees the
PLO _ viewed by Israel as a terrorist group _ would play no role in
the peace process.
   It also wants the agenda limited to Israel's elections proposal,
which says negotiations would be held with elected representatives
on limited autonomy for 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   The PLO wants a broader agenda so Palestinian demands for
independent statehood can be raised. It also wants to take part in
selecting the Palestinian delegation for the dialogue with Israel,
and the Egyptian response also apparently contained such a
condition.

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino's ability
to survive politically is in doubt and may depend on how seriously
she takes the lessons of the coup attempt against her, a senior
Bush administration official said Wednesday.
   ``She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' said the
official, who briefed a small group of reporters on the condition
he not be named.
   It was the first time since the military rebellion began Friday
that the Bush administration had voiced concerns about the mutiny's
long-term effects on Aquino's future.
   The official spoke a little more than an hour before news came
from Manila that rebel troops holding a downtown district had
agreed to return to their barracks.
   The administration official, in an apparent attempt to send a
clear signal to Aquino, said the United States must now ``reassess
what all this means'' in terms of U.S. assistance to her government.
   He did not elaborate.
   But the official called the insurrection a ``serious'' attempt
to topple Mrs. Aquino and said she should regard it as such.
   He called on Mrs. Aquino to seek to ``eliminate the sources of
discontent which helped lead to the coup'' as she struggles to
reassert control.
   Asked if Aquino could survive politically if she succeeds
militarily in putting down the rebel forces, the official said:
   ``That's a tough one.
   ``There has been a lot of criticism of her from the army'' for
not giving military leaders more of a free hand in cracking down on
the leftist New People's Army and for ``ignoring the military,''
the official said.
   ``I don't know if it's justified or not. It is what they
believe,'' he went on, adding that the criticism is ``a symptom of
feelings. And, as a political leader, she has to deal with it.''
   It is elements of Aquino's own army that are rebelling against
her now. The U.S. official noted that the restiveness in the
military gave Col. Gregorio Honasan, a leader of the coup attempt,
far more support over the last week than he had when he led a
previous effort to oust Mrs. Aquino.
   Earlier, U.S. officials praised as ``careful and effective'' a
Philippine evacuation that freed 280 Americans and other foreigners
from the Manila hotels where they had been trapped by gunfire in
the six-day-old rebellion.
   ``We commend the Aquino government for organizing and carrying
out this operation,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler, applauding the ``careful and effective manner in which it
dealt with the situation in the Makati commercial district and the
efforts it took to safeguard American citizens and others who were
in the area.''
   The evacuation followed negotiations between the Aquino
government and the rebels ``into the early hours'' of Wednesday to
reach a cease-fire, she said, but declined to comment on restraint
shown by the rebels. U.S. officials had no contact with the rebels,
she said.
   ``It's unfortunate that the rebels caused this situation,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said. ``We are obviously not going to get out here in a
position and applaud the rebels. We are applauding the Aquino
government.''
   All those trapped in the hotel district were freed without
injury, she said, and were taken by bus to processing centers set
up by the U.S. Embassy to help them contact relatives and make
lodging and travel plans.
   ``While the situation has improved, we continue to urge American
citizens to exercise caution,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Aquino's declaration of a state of national emergency was
``totally, legally what she has done under their constitution,''
Ms. Tutwiler said, declining further comment on the Philippine
government's response to the week-old rebellion.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also declined
comment on the emergency declaration other than to say, ``We will
take a look at it and see if we have any concerns.''
   Some 2,000 foreigners had been trapped for four days in hotels
by the military coup attempt that had left at least 79 dead and 570
wounded since Friday.

   A service aboard the USS Arizona
Memorial highlights ceremonies Thursday to mark the 48th
anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which plunged
the United States into World War II.
   The sunken Arizona is the final resting place for 1,102 Navy men
and Marines killed in the early morning attack Dec. 7, 1941. The
memorial spans the hull of the battleship, which still flies the
U.S. flag. It is the only Navy ship not in commission that is
allowed to do so.
   The memorial service would include prayers, presentations of
wreaths, a 21-gun salute and the playing of echo taps.
   A moment of silence would be observed throughout the naval base
at 7:55 a.m., the exact moment of the Japanese attack.
   To end the minute of silence, F-15 jets from the Hawaii Air
National Guard will fly over the memorial in a ``missing man''
formation.
   Because of limited space aboard the memorial, attendance is by
invitation only, but numerous survivors of the attack and members
of various veterans and patriotic groups are expected to be on hand.
   The National Park Service, which manages the memorial and its
nearby visitor center, will hold a simultaneous observance on shore
for the general public.
   The park service planned special activities Thursday, including
lectures by survivors, special exhibits and footage of the attack.
The U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Band is to perform later in the day.
   A memorial ceremony is also scheduled at nearby Hickam Air Force
Base.

<HEAD>Chowchilla School Bus Kidnapper Denied Parole</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of three men who commandeered
a school bus and held the driver and 26 children underground in a
$5 million ransom plot was denied parole Wednesday for the sixth
time.
   The California Board of Prison Terms refused James Schoenfeld's
latest bid for freedom after a 2{-hour hearing at the prison where
he is serving a life sentence in the 1976 kidnapping.
   The denial was based on Schoenfield's crime, ``which was carried
out in an especially heinous, atrocious, cruel and callous manner
which exhibits a disregard for the life or suffering of another,''
said Phyllis Scott, a spokeswoman for the three-member board.
   Schoenfeld, 37, who was sentenced in 1978, will be eligible for
parole again in December 1990, Ms. Scott said.
   Schoenfeld, his brother, Richard, and Frederick Woods were
convicted of the July 15, 1976, abduction of the Chowchilla school
bus driver and 26 children headed home from summer school. The
children ranged in age from 5 to 14.
   The kidnappers placed the youngsters and bus driver in a moving
van buried at a rock quarry near Livermore, almost 100 miles west
of Chowchilla, which is 240 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   ``The prisoner and crime partners kidnapped at shotgun point 26
youngsters and their school bus driver and transported them 100
miles away to a buried van,'' Ms. Scott said.
   The youngsters and driver escaped after 17 hours in the
sweltering van, 28 hours after their abduction. The van was
equipped with a single air vent to allow the group to breath
underground.
   The Schoenfeld brothers and Woods were members of prominent San
Francisco Peninsula families and said in pre-sentencing reports
that they planned to seek $5 million ransom.
   They were thwarted in telephoning their ransom demands to
authorities in Chowchilla because the telephone lines were tied up
constantly by law enforcement officials and reporters the day after
the kidnapping.
   The board also denied parole based on a psychological evaluation
of Schoenfeld in September, Ms. Scott said. She would not provide
details of the evaluation.
   During the hearing, the panel commended Schoenfeld for his good
behavior and his excellent work record as a vocational drafting
clerk, Ms. Scott said.
   Richard Schoenfeld and Woods also received life terms and have
been denied parole periodically.

<HEAD>Cambodian Guerrillas Report Taking Two Key Towns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas fighting the Cambodian
government said they seized two key towns near the Thai border
Tuesday and Wednesday, killing dozens of soldiers and opening the
way for an attack on a military operations center.
   The report, if confirmed, would appear to represent the biggest
guerrilla victory over the Vietnamese-installed government since
communist Khmer Rouge rebels seized the rich gem-mining town of
Pailin further south on Oct. 22.
   The guerrillas said they captured Svay Chek on Tuesday night and
Treas on Wednesday morning. The towns in northwestern Battambang
province lie along Route 69, leading to the military operations
center at Sisophon, 16 miles south of Svay Chek.
   No immediate comment came from the government on the combat
report.
   Ek Sereywath, spokesman for Prince Norodom Sihanouk's guerrilla
forces, issued a statement saying 747 fighters of Sihanouk's group
and 300 from the Khmer People's National Liberation Front attacked
Treas and captured two Soviet-built T-54 tanks and one 122mm
artillery piece.
   He said resistance forces seized seven tons of ammunition.
   The resistance coalition consists of Sihanouk's forces, the
Khmer Rouge and the Liberation Front.
   About 3,000 Liberation Front guerrillas attacked Svay Chek, said
Gen. Dien Del, deputy commander of the Front's army. He said many
government soldiers died and that ``six to seven'' guerrillas were
killed and 30 wounded.
   ``We captured more than 1,000 weapons. We have been trying for
more than a month to take Svay Chek. This is a big victory for
us,'' said Dien Del, reached by telephone at the Thai border town
of Aranyaprathet.
   On Nov. 27, government forces repulsed the guerrillas from
positions around Svay Chek seized by the government the day before.
The official state radio said 50 guerrillas died in that attack.
   The guerrillas are fighting forces of the government that
Vietnam installed after invading Cambodia in late 1978 and ousting
a brutal Khmer Rouge regime.
   The guerrillas have made important advances in battlefields
bordering Thailand since late September, when Vietnam said it
withdrew the last of its troops. The guerrillas say they want to
force the government back to peace talks with more flexibility on
the issue of sharing power with the guerrillas.
   Ek said the guerrillas destroyed bridges to cut a section of
national highway running from the national capital, Phnom Penh, to
Siem Reap, the northwestern provincial capital 140 miles away.
   The highway is used to transport troops and supplies to
northwestern battlefields. The claim could not be independently
confirmed.

<HEAD>Former Regulator: Bush Son On Board Stalled Closure Of Troubled S&amp;L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials delayed closing a
troubled Colorado savings and loan largely because President Bush's
son was on its board, a former federal bank regulator charged in a
published report Wednesday.
   ``Neil Bush's presence was a material part of unconscionable
delays in taking over Silverado,'' James Moroney told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
   Moroney is a former staff analyst for the Topeka Federal Home
Loan Bank, which supervised Silverado Savings and Loan of Denver.
   The head of the Topeka bank at the time denied that Neil Bush's
presence was an influence.
   ``The economic substance of Silverado's loan portfolio was
comparable to a Ponzi scheme (a type of pyramid investment fraud),
and it couldn't have worked out,'' said Moroney, 42, a Kansas City
lawyer who left the Topeka bank after six months in 1986.
   ``It was insolvent back (in 1986). It was not a judgment call.
That place, clearly, was very insolvent,'' Moroney said.
   Neil Bush resigned from Silverado's board just after his father
won the Republican nomination in 1988 and only four months before
the S&amp;L's seizure.
   The Chronicle also reported that documents it obtained show top
federal regulators knew the thrift's financial situation was bad
enough to mandate restrictions on investments and insider deals at
least 14 months before it was closed Dec. 9, 1988.
   Moroney said he believes a big reason his district superiors,
including former Topeka bank president Kermit Mowbray, allowed
Silverado to continue was their knowledge that Neil Bush and
Republican Party fund raiser Larry Mizel, of MDC Holdings, were
involved with the institution.
   Mowbray, who retired the month that Silverado closed, denied
Moroney's allegations Tuesday, saying: ``Neil Bush being on that
board had no effect on our decisions.'' Mowbray, who said he never
met Bush, also denied knowing that Silverado was insolvent in 1986.
   In 1986, Moroney said he approached a fellow supervisor and
asked: ``Why are we putting up with this Silverado? We would not
permit that type of loan work-out for another institution.''
   ``And he looked at me, and said, `Well, you know who one of the
directors is.' And I said, `No.' And he said, `The vice president's
son. Neil Bush,''' Moroney told the Chronicle.
   However, he said he has no evidence that either Bush or Mizel
exerted direct pressure for ``the preferential treatment they
got.'' He said their presence was enough to cause Mowbray to take
an extraordinary interest in Silverado and to proceed cautiously in
the case.
   Bush, reached by telephone at his office in Denver, said, ``I'm
going to cooperate in any way I'm asked to. It would be
inappropriate for me to get into any details except with
authorities investigating Silverado.''
   In a news conference Wednesday in Washington, D.C., President
Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked whether the president
was concerned that Silverado's collapse might have have been partly
due to regulators who were ``fearful of Neil Bush's role.''
   Fitzwater replied, ``These matters are all under investigation
and consideration and we won't offer any comment on any aspect of
it. I might say, Neil's been off that board for a long time.''
   President Bush is scheduled to visit Denver on Friday.

   The military issued its first warning
Wednesday in the turmoil that has convulsed East Germany, and a
non-Communist took over as head of state to end a 40-year lock the
Communists held on the presidency.
   The government reported signs that angry citizens were storming
army installations, and military leaders pledged to repel any
attempts to seize weapons and munitions.
   Manfred Gerlach, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party,
replaced Egon Krenz as interim president, the first time a
non-Communist had become president since East Germany's founding in
1949. Gerlach's party recently broke off its long alliance with the
Communists after weeks of spearheading reforms.
   The Communists advanced their emergency session one week to
Friday to overhaul the party's structure.
   Shedding such ``Stalinist'' operations as the Central Committee
and ruling Politburo is one possibility. Breaking up the party is
another.
   In seven weeks, the country has faced a virtual revolution that
first ousted a hard-line leadership and then threw out senior
Communist Party chiefs. A 25-member committee of Communists now
runs the nation.
   The National Defense Council, in charge of the armed forces,
quit on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the leadership of the
once-dreaded secret police quit.
   The official ADN news agency reported late Wednesday the suicide
of an official caught two days earlier trying to leave a government
building with two suitcases stuffed with East German and West
German money.
   ADN did not give his name, but said he was connected to the case
of fugitive Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, the former top East
German foreign trade official accused of running a weapons-selling
ring.
   Early Thursday, West Berlin police spokesman Helmut Hinz
announced Schalck-Golodkowski was in a West Berlin prison after an
international manhunt. ADN said he had turned himself in to
authorities late Wednesday but did not elaborate.
   West Germany's ZDF television network reported
Schalck-Golodkowski planned to pay back $31 million to the East
German government from Swiss bank accounts. He is suspected of
having smuggled several times that amount from the country,
according to reports on East Germany's state television.
   Manfred Seidel, the No. 2 official in that scandal-plagued
office, was arrested on suspicion of having smuggled $110 million
out of the country.
   The Christian Democrats, a small party that recently broke with
the Communists, said growing financial scandals were making East
Germany look like a ``banana republic.''
   The government announced a partial amnesty Wednesday, following
hunger strikes spreading to penal institutions nationwide. It
applies to those sentenced to three years or less and excludes
prisoners convicted of ``rowdiness,'' a term once applied to
pro-democracy demonstrators but also sometimes used for more
serious offenders.
   The reform movement exploded here after hard-liner Erich
Honecker was ousted following 18 years as Communist Party chief.
Since then, a popular uprising and a flood of refugees to the West
forced the government to open East Germany's borders and the Berlin
Wall to let citizens travel freely.
   East Germans also have been promised open elections, but the
country's overall direction remains unclear.
   Pro-democracy opposition groups so far lack the coordination to
fill the power vaccum left by the Communists' hasty retreat.
   For days, reports surfaced of furious citizens barging into
secret police offices, including storming one building in the
southern city of Gera on Wednesday.
   A citizens committee pressing for reforms in Leipzig occupied
regional state security headquarters there on Monday, and an ADN
report suggested the activists still controlled the building.
   The assaults were meant to stop destruction of documents needed
in prosecuting former Communist officials.
   An investigative commission recommended criminal charges against
former secret police boss Erich Mielke, 81, for police attacks
against demonstrators in October that touched off the revolutionary
changes.
   The government, headed by reformist Premier Hans Modrow, said
late Wednesday ``indications'' emerged that people were storming
army installations.
   No details were given, but the government appealed for ``calm
and restraint.''
   The National People's Army leadership issued its own statement,
addressed to both soldiers and citizens, saying: ``Such intrusions
could cause danger for the security of the German Democratic
Republic.
   ``Illegal entry to weapons, munitions and fuel will be blocked.''
   Military leaders expressed ``concern for securing peace'' and
pledged to work with Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces to secure peace
in Central Europe.
   ``Only together can we preserve the sovereignty of the German
Democratic Republic and protect our country from anarchy and
chaos,'' they said.
   The government's appeal for calm was the top item on East
Germany's main TV news program, which said Lutheran Church leaders
joined the call.
   The program said ``the church has information making it
increasingly concerned about calls for revenge ... that the search
for the guilty has frightened many people.''
   In resigning, Krenz warned of ``anti-socialistic forces''
filling the nation and called for a joint effort to repel them.
   ``In this hour of greatest danger all those who love this
country must stand together out of patriotic duty.''
   Krenz quit as Communist Party chief on Sunday.
   Opposition leaders and members of his own party said he was too
tainted by scandals of the Honecker era to guide the nation out of
its economic and political crisis.
   Gerlach, looking somber, announced his appointment on TV, saying
he was ``not glad'' about taking on the duties.
   He will serve as president until Parliament picks a permanent
replacement. Speculation grew that another non-Communist would take
over permanently, although Gerlach ruled himself out.
   The presidency is a largely ceremonial but highly visible post.
The president routinely represents the country on foreign trips.

   Leftist guerrillas on Wednesday
released an American helicopter mechanic they had held prisoner
with his thumbs tied behind his back for 22 hours, the U.S. Embassy
confirmed.
   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN, had reported on their clandestine radio what they described
as the brief detention of a U.S. citizen. The insurgents identified
the man as Jack Cooper and said he was a U.S. military adviser.
   Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said the man's surname is not
Cooper, but declined to identify him, citing the privacy act. He
also said the man is not an adviser, describing him as a civilian
helicopter mechanic under contract to the 55 U.S. military advisers
based in El Salvador.
   The rebels said on Radio Venceremos they detained the American
late Tuesday at a guerrilla roadblock on the capital's western
edge, in the affluent Escalon neighborhood.
   Escalon has been the scene of sustained combat twice since Nov.
11, when the insurgents launched their largest offensive of the
10-year-old civil war. Both times, after invading the neighborhood
for several hours, they retreated up the San Salvador volcano that
looms over the capital's northwestern sector.
   The guerrillas said the man and a Salvadoran woman companion
were briefly questioned and released.
   Brown said the man was indeed detained in upper Escalon, but was
held from 7:30 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday. He said the
man's car was stolen and he was forced to stand for ``several
hours.'' His thumbs were tied behind his back while he was held, he
said.
   The rebels have reiterated repeatedly in recent months they do
not consider non-military U.S. personnel objectives in their war
against the government. Guerrillas occupied the houses of several
American families last week during an incursion into Escalon, but
called a truce to permit their evacuation.

   Manfred Gerlach quickly took up the call for
reforms as the once-monolithic East German power structure began to
crumble in October.
   On Wednesday, the Liberal Democratic Party chief became the
country's first non-Communist president.
   In the anything goes world of East German politics, the
61-year-old Gerlach was able to maneuver himself out from the
Communists' shadow into national prominence.
   The Communists for decades counted four smaller parties as their
allies, among them Gerlach's Liberal Democrats. The ``national
front'' that bound them together routinely picked up more than 99
percent of the vote in government-controlled elections.
   The system gave the country at least an outward semblance of
democracy despite the hard-line leadership. In reality, the
Communist Party ran the show and no one challenged it.
   That all changed on Oct. 7, as party chief Erich Honecker faced
huge street protests and heard a stern warning from visiting Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that ``he who is late is punished.''
   Less than two weeks later, the 77-year-old Honecker was out and
his protege Egon Krenz was in, this time with a vague promise of
free elections.
   Gerlach, a gray-haired, professorial-looking lawyer, quickly
took up the cause of free elections and other causes as well. He
demanded an end to Communist monopoly on power and greater openness
in society. He insisted that officials look into why tens of
thousands of people were fleeing the country.
   The three other parties _ Farmers Party, National Democrats, and
Christian Democrats _ quickly joined in the calls for reform, but
by then Gerlach was well out in front.
   That seeming overnight conversion isn't without its detractors.
   ``The four parties are acting as if they were seduced virgins
who are now trying to run away from the big, bad Communist Party,''
opposition leader Rainer Eppellmann said last month.
   Still, Gerlach's composure and outspokenness won him supporters,
as he appealed for greater tolerance and denounced anti-Semitism.
   Gerlach told Parliament on Nov. 17 that his party was breaking
from the Communist alliance and called for a ``true sharing of
power'' in free voting.
   But he also made it clear in a television interview that ``we
are a party socialists in a socialist system.''
   ``The task before us now is to define what socialism means and
how we can make it meet the needs of the people.''
   The insider-turned-outsider saw his main wish come true last
Friday when the Communist-dominated parliament scrapped the party's
leading role in society.
   Even within the fast-forward pace of change in East Europe, that
was record time _ with the results due in part to Gerlach.
   It has paid off. A public opinion poll conducted in East Germany
for West Germany's Stern magazine says the Liberal Democrats would
reach second place, behind the huge and sometimes unwieldy New
Forum movement, if free elections were held today.
   The Communists would be third, the poll said.
   Despite the success, a somber Gerlach said he was ``not happy''
about taking on the new duties as head of state.
   Gerlach indicated he wouldn't actively seek to hold on to the
job when the parliament fills the presidency on a permanent basis _
but it seemed certain that the equivalent of a ``draft'' would keep
him on as president.
   While the job's powers are limited, the East German president
does represent the country on foreign visits. Gerlach's stature and
demeanor are probably just what's needed abroad for a country that
his allies, the Christian Democrats, say is reaching ``banana
republic'' stage.
   Gerlach had already been serving as the country's vice
president, before Wednesday's vote. A Liberal Democrat since the
end of the war, Gerlach also served as mayor of Leipzig in the
1950s.
   In addition to Gerlach, the parliament also has a non-Communist
chief. Farmers Party chief Guenther Maleuda was elected speaker on
Nov. 13.

   A five-alarm fire broke out Wednesday on a
cruise ship moored for repairs near downtown Portland, injuring
five people before it was contained, the harbormaster said.
   About 450 people were on the 618-foot Bermuda Star moored at
Swan Island when the fire broke out shortly after 1 p.m. in an area
where welders were working, said Harbormaster Mell Pittmon.
   The fire was contained by 3 p.m., he said.
   The blaze quickly went to four alarms, and a fifth alarm was
issued about an hour later, fire officials said. At least 100
firefighters and 30 pieces of answered the alarm.
   Two crew members trapped in a lower deck were rescued from the
ship, and five crew members suffered smoke inhalation and were
taken to area hospitals, Pittmon said.
   The 14,208-ton ship arrived at the Port of Portland on Tuesday
to undergo $25 million worth of repairs.
   Those on board included 250 repair workers and 200 crew members,
Pittmon said.

<TEXT>
   Academy Award-winning composer Sammy Fain,
who wrote such enduring tunes as ``Love Is a Many Splendored
Thing,'' ``That Old Feeling'' and the wartime classic ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   The two-time Oscar recipient, who suffered a heart attack, was
at the UCLA Medical Center when he died, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most memorable pop
hits of American music this century.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``Let A Smile
Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Wedding Bells Are
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night''
among them.
   ```I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
said ASCAP President Morton Gould of the World War II song.
   ``It's hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He
was such a sweet person, such a gentle person,'' Gould said.
   Fain's collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis
Webster, Mitchell Parish, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg, and Alan and
Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said lyricist Parish in a telephone interview
from New York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets. Workmen, whatever
they were doing, would be singing strains of our songs. ... That
explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain was nominated for 10 Academy Awards during his long career.
He won for best song for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from
the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Known for a self-effacing style, Fain's modesty even extended to
Academy Award politics. When he had a little-heard 1976
Oscar-nominated song, ``A World That Never Was,'' from a
little-seen movie called ``Half a House,'' he said in a trade paper
advertisement: ``It would be nice if we had a commercial record,
but we don't. It would also be nice if we were in a widely seen
motion picture, but we don't have that, either.''
   To make up for those shortcomings, Fain provided a
``Dial-a-Song'' phone number so Academy voters could hear his song.
But the award went to ``Evergreen'' that year.
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902, Fain was
a piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until
teaming with lyricist Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows
What A Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash review
``Hellzapoppin'' in 1938.
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that same year, ``I'll Be
Seeing You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime
classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote all the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
lifetime achievement.
   He had been a member of the ASCAP board of directors for the
past 10 years.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Scattered Snow in Northeast, Midwest, West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow was scattered over sections of the Northeast, the Midwest
and the West on Wednesday, and high-temperature records up to 55
years old were broken or tied in California and Alabama.
   Scattered snow fell during the evening on parts of Maine, New
York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, the Dakotas,
Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.
   In the six hours ending at 7 p.m. EST, 2 inches of snow fell in
Great Falls and Havre, Mont.
   Southeast Colorado and northern New Mexico had snow during the
afternoon and evening.
   By 4 p.m. EST, 5 inches of snow had fallen in West Cliff, Colo.,
and 3 inches in Canon City, Colo. A snow advisory was up for
Colorado's Sangre de Cristo Mountains and northern mountains.
   Three inches had fallen in Chama, N.M., by 6 p.m. EST. Much of
the state was under a snow advisory.
   The forecast called for rain changing to snow in Oklahoma
Wednesday night through Thursday. Northwest Texas was expected to
get a wintry mix of snow, sleet and rain accompanied by lower
temperatures and gusty winds.
   Snow was also expected to fall in western Kansas.
   A winter storm watch for 4 or more inches of snow was posted for
North Carolina's northern mountains.
   Rain fell Wednesday on sections of Colorado, Ohio, Kentucky,
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York and southern New England.
   Rain and thunderstorms stretched from the upper Texas coast to
southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southwest and central
Alabama.
   In Southern California, high-wind advisories were posted through
Thursday for mountains, coastal areas below passes and canyons.
Motorists driving vehicles with high profiles were urged to be
cautious.
   The temperature hit 70 degrees in downtown Sacramento, Calif.,
where the record for the date of 69 had stood since 1979. Records
were also set in Mountain View, Calif. (71 degrees, 68 in 1979) and
Huntsville, Ala. (69, 68 in 1980). The mercury hit 68 degrees at
the Sacramento airport, tying a record set in 1934.
   The high temperature for the nation was 87 degrees in Borrego
Springs, Calif.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nationalistic fervor whipped up by
the government is turning the title fight Thursday between Sugar
Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran into a symbolic political clash.
   The fight comes at a low point in Panama-United States
relations, with the U.S. government continuing economic sanctions
in a bid to force the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
head of Panama's Defense Forces and de facto leader. A coup that
began with U.S. support was botched in October.
   ``For Panama, I am going to beat that loudmouth,'' Duran said in
a television advertisment, in which he also asks fans ``to be smart
and bet on me.''
   This capital city is expected to come to a standstill Thursday
night during the live television broadcast of the fight. Giant
screens are being put up in low-income neighborhoods to make it
easier for fans to watch and cheer Duran.
   A radio announcer warned Tuesday that the Defense Forces should
be alert because it would be the best time for an invasion by U.S.
forces.
   But many of the nearly 12,000 soldiers on U.S. bases in Panama
also will be watching the fight.
   ``You can imagine whom I'll be rooting for,'' a U.S. Army
officer said. ``Leonard.''
   The fight, at Las Vegas, has joined government officials and
opposition leaders in wishing that the durable Duran, known as
``Mano de Piedra'' or ``Hands of Stone,'' wins his fifth world
crown.
   A popular novelty item is a baseball hat with Duran's name and
four embroidered crowns.
   ``I am going to put the fifth one here,'' a fan told a
television interviewer, pointing to the center of his hat.
   The nationalistic fever was boosted this week by Duran when he
called sports officials to say that U.S officials had forbidden the
singing of the Panamanian national anthem before the fight.
   Sanctions forbid U.S. companies to deal commercially with
people, companies or agencies associated with Noriega, so
broadcasting rights became a controversial issue.
   A promoter not on the U.S. blacklist obtained the rights to the
Leonard-Duran bout, but U.S. officials told the company not to
relay it to the government station. The government station wanted
to make a deal, but the promoters were afraid of upsetting the U.S.
government and being added to the list associated with Noriega.
   Spokesmen for the government station refused to say if it
planned a delayed transmission.
   ``It is a pity, because this is a country with knowledgeable
boxing fans,'' said sports promoter Edmundo Vargas.
   However, the promotion company gave up its rights, and the U.S.
company, Top Rank, dealt directly with a private television channel
that will broadcast to Panama City and Colon, about 50 miles to the
north.
   Last week, Panamanians also got around U.S. restrictions by
sending a horse co-owned by a Noriega friend to Puerto Rico, where
it won the Caribbean Classic.
   ``There are no visa restrictions for horses,'' a foreign
diplomat said. ``And although everybody here knows who owns the
horse, apparently they sent it there as if it were owned by
somebody else.''
   Newspapers portrayed the victory of the Panamanian horse as a
win over the United States.

   Roman Catholic Assemblywoman Lucy Killea was narrowly elected to
California's Senate because the church made a ``martyr'' out of the
Democrat by denying her Communion for supporting abortion rights,
her GOP opponent said Wednesday.
   Killea disputed Assemblywoman Carol Bentley's analysis of
Tuesday's special election, saying her stance hurt her as much as
it helped.
   In North Dakota, Gov. George Sinner proposed $98 million in
spending cuts after voters Tuesday rejected three proposed tax
increases, two of which had already gone into effect after approval
by the Legislature.
   Five other referendums, including one requiring seat belt use
and another mandating a statewide sex education curriculum, and a
proposed constitutional amendment were also defeated.
   ``People were in the mood to vote `no,' and once they started
voting no, they just kept going,'' said state Rep. Tish Kelly of
Fargo.
   In Northern California, a four-year legal battle to boost
Hispanic representation on Watsonsville's city council ended with
Hispanics losing three of four seats they'd sought under a new
election system. Seven seats had been up for grabs.
   Killea's margin over Bentley in the San Diego County election
was razor thin. She got 61,860 ballots, or 50.97 percent of the
vote, to 59,496 for Bentley, or 49.03.
   Bentley, a freshman from La Mesa, said at a news conference that
Bishop Leo Maher ``had no choice'' but to deny Holy Communion to
Killea three weeks ago, making her the first U.S. elected official
to be so sanctioned.
   But, Bentley added, ``The bishop's action created an
international celebrity and martyr.''
   ``I don't see that,'' Killea said at her post-election news
conference. ``We got an awful lot of people who opposed me because
of the bishop's decision. I think it worked both ways. ... I don't
think we'll ever know.''
   Maher reiterated his displeasure with Killea, saying he made an
example of her because she had the responsibility as a Roman
Catholic elected official to follow church teachings in the public
arena.
   ``It is to be noted that no popular vote or public opinion can
change in any way the divine law that directs and guides
humankind,'' Maher said in a statement.
   Killea replaces an incumbent who resigned to become a municipal
judge.
   In North Dakota, 253,439 people, or 53 percent of those
eligible, cast ballots. The seven referendums were the most on a
ballot since 1919.
   About 60 percent of the voters rejected proposed increases in
income and motor fuel taxes, and a proposed raise in the sales tax
lost 53 percent to 47 percent.
   ``I am very disappointed, obviously, in the outcome,'' Sinner
said in proposing $34 million in cuts for elementary and secondary
education, $24 million for higher education and $21 million for
social services.
   Some attributed the defeat to years of drought and a decade of
economic hardship. ``North Dakota people are short of money and
hurting,'' said state Sen. Geraldine Meyer.
   The state Tax Department told merchants to immediately lower the
sales tax from 6 percent to 5 percent. State income taxes dropped
from 17 percent to 14 percent of a federal tax bill. The gas-tax
hike never took effect.
   In addition to the seat belt and sex education referendums,
voters rejected proposals to legalize video gambling and put state
lawmakers in the public employee retirement system.
   The defeated constitutional amendment would have limited the
number of state agencies under the governor's control to 14. More
than 100 now fall under gubernatorial jurisdiction.
   Watsonville's court-ordered election was the first under a
district-vote system. Council candidates previously were elected at
large.
   The election was originally scheduled for Nov. 7, but was
postponed after the Oct. 17 earthquake, which demolished more than
300 homes in the farming community 95 miles south of San Francisco.
   One Hispanic candidate blamed her defeat on the disaster. ``We
just didn't have the money, or whatever it took, to beat an
earthquake,'' community organizer Cruz Gomez said at a glum
post-election gathering.
   The only Hispanic to win a seat on the council was Oscar Rios,
the charismatic leader of a 19-month cannery strike.

<HEAD>American Medical Association Strengthens Pro-Choice Stand In Abortiton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association took a strong
pro-choice stand on abortion here Tuesday, saying ``the early
termination of pregnancy is a medical matter between the patient
and the physician.''
   The AMA's House of Delegates voted to reaffirm the association's
policy statement that abortion should be peformed only by a
licensed physician in conformance with state laws, and that no
physician should be required to perform an abortion in violation of
good medical judgment or his or her personal moral principles.
   The delegates then adopted, on a voice vote, the pro-choice
amendment offered by the California delegation. However, the ``no''
votes were nearly as strong as the affirmative votes.
   Delegates from some states argued that the amendment would run
counter to positions taken by their state associations.
   The delegates also consdered a proposed policy statement on
maternal-fetal conflict, but referred the matter to the Board of
Trustees for further study before the the next annual meeting in
June 1990.
   Physicians are wrangling with legal and moral issues arising
when a pregnant woman refuses medical treatment that would benefit
the health of her fetus.
   Also referred back to the trustees for further study was a
proposed patient bill of rights, which stated that patients should
have the right to basic and essential medical care.

   Rebel troops gave up their stronghold
in the Makati business district Thursday and returned to their
barracks, seven days after launching a coup attempt against
President Corazon Aquino.
   ``This is unconditional surrender,'' said Brig. Gen. Arturo
Enrile, head of the Philippine Military Academy who led
negotiations throughout the night with rebel leaders. ``The problem
is already finished.''
   However, rebels who marched the 1\ miles back to nearby Fort
Bonifacio were smiling, chanting ``No surrender, the fight goes
on!'' Soldiers at the army base there unfurled a white sheet at the
gate saying, ``Welcome Home.''
   Rebels still held Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles south of
Manila. However, local officials Thursday were trying to arrange
talks there to end the occupation at the last known rebel
stronghold.
   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 others
wounded since the coup began Friday.
   Mrs. Aquino, who faced the gravest crisis of her 3{-year-old
administration, expressed relief that the siege was over.
   ``I would also like to commend those who helped to bring about
this end to urban terrorism,'' she said in a written statement.
``We must now all join hands and consolidate our resources to
rebuild what has been destroyed.''
   Thursday's announcement came one day after 1,800 foreigners,
including about 250 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-held
luxury hotels in Makati and Mrs. Aquino declared a national state
of emergency.
   As the rebels left the skyscrapers and hotels, seized last
Saturday, the atmosphere seemed more one of victory than defeat.
   The mutineers, rifles, bazookas, machine guns and bandoleers of
ammunition slung over their shoulders, sang the theme song of their
Scout Ranger unit as they marched to Fort Bonifacio.
   ``We have won some victories,'' said rebel Capt. Danilo Lim.
``We have made a very strong statement.'' As the mutineers marched
past the exclusive Forbes Park neighborhood, where U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas Platt lives, some residents stood on the street and
cheered.
   ``I would like to say that the soldiers are voluntarily
returning to barracks,'' Lim told reporters as he left Makati. ``We
did not surrender.''
   Rebel spokesman Capt. Albert Yen said, ``We are willing to face
the consequences of our acts, but the fight must go on.''
   Scout ranger Cpl. Roy Bantung, another mutineer, said: ``We will
not surrender, even if it takes forever. The government must
change. Cory must change her policies.'' He was using President
Aquino's nickname.
   The government agreed the rebels will be treated ``humanely,
justly and fairly,'' Enrile said. But he added they would ``suffer
the consequences'' for launching the sixth coup attempt against
Mrs. Aquino since she came to power in February 1986.
   He did not elaborate. Most rebel officers in past coup attempts
have simply been confined to barracks, and many enlisted men were
sent back into the ranks. Some rebels have been charged but been
acquitted or given light sentences.
   Rebels agreed about midnight to give up, Enrile said. ``We all
agreed that if they returned to the barracks ... it would be good
for the nation as a whole.''
   He added that the rebels' political demands, which included the
resignation of Mrs. Aquino, ``were non-negotiable.''
   The rebels seized hotels and buildings in the financial area
Saturday on the second day of their coup attempt.
   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flw air cover for loyalist
forces, without firing on the rebels, and prevented insurgents from
continuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. They had seized the
base in the first hours of the coup.
   Rebel leaders said the uprising was codenamed ``Seven Days and
Seven Nights in December,'' and would involve a seven-stage
operation. The leaders said the takeover of the financial district
was the second stage.
   President Aquino early Wednesday evoked the ``people power''
revolution in appealing for support against mutinous soldiers bent
on overthrowing her government.
   ``I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake for
democracy; I have lost my husband,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a
nationally televised address, appearing tired.
   ``Why did I become president? It was because you believed in me,
and in spite of all of the coup attempts, you have stuck by me''
against enemies who want ``to kill me ... so that they can rule our
land,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain in 1983 as
he arrived from self-imposed exile in the United States to
challenge President Ferdinand E. Marcos. She took his place as the
opposition presidential candidate and was swept into office by a
popular uprising. Marcos went into exile in Hawaii.
   After her speech Wednesday, the government announced that Mrs.
Aquino had proclaimed a national state of emergency, giving her
broad powers to cope with the rebellion launched Friday by
thousands of soldiers.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
evacuation was managed without incident, and ``all Americans were
reported safe and we have no reports of injuries.''
   After the evacuation, rebel and army representatives began talks
on ending the rebellion. Sporadic sniping resumed, but the
cease-fire generally held through the day.
   It was unclear what new powers Mrs. Aquino would have. Cabinet
officials insisted personal liberties would not be curtailed, but
said special powers were needed to deal with the economic and
social crisis caused by the coup.
   Public confidence has been shaken far more than by any of the
five other coup attempts.
   Jose Fernandez, governor of the Central Bank, said Wednesday two
billion pesos ($91 million) had been withdrawn in runs on Manila
banks the past two days and many parts of the archipelago had cash
shortages because domestic air service had been suspended.
   Labor Secretary Franklin Drilon said: ``This is not martial law.
There's no curfew, there's no suspension of the writ of habeas
corpus. Congress will continue. We will continue to enjoy our
rights. It only empowers government to check those who may not be
delivering basic services.''
   Rep. Salvador Britannico, an opposition legislator, said the
emergency declaration would discourage foreign investment and was
``a first step ... toward the declaration of martial law.''
   Adolfo Azcuna, the government press secretary, said officials
planned to take control of utilities and transport. Josephina
Lichaoco, chairman of the National Telecommunications Commission,
said new media guidelines would be issued.
   Among other things, she said, they would forbid the broadcast of
``rebellious terrorist propaganda'' comments and interviews, and
``strategic information'' such as troop movements, weapons and
numbers of soldiers.
   In her television address, Mrs. Aquino urged Filipinos to fill
the streets Friday in the same demonstration of ``people power''
that forced the late President Marcos into exile.
   ``It is very clear that these people want to kill me, to
eliminate me, so that they can rule our land,'' she said.
   ``What they have forgotten is, power is not theirs to take. They
cannot just grab power by killing people. They have to understand,
power belongs to you, my beloved countrymen.''
   The rebels have demanded Mrs. Aquino resign in favor of a
coalition that would hold a referendum on a new government. They
accuse her of ignoring corruption, refusing to make social and
economic reform and failing to crush the Communist insurgency that
began a generation ago under Marcos.

   President Bush, seeking to disarm criticism
from the right, says the United States should help spur democratic
changes inside the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe despite
persistent differences over Soviet aid to leftist regimes in
Central America.
   Bush was expected to review the dramatic events unfolding in
Europe today in an Oval Office meeting with Bettino Craxi, the
secretary of the Italian Socialist Party.
   Meanwhile, the White House denied Tuesday there was any
difference in attitudes toward the Soviets between Bush and Vice
President Dan Quayle, who said in a newspaper interview that the
Soviets were ``a totalitarian government'' that had not ``changed
much in foreign policy.''
   Bush, in his first public comments since returning to the White
House from Europe on Monday, told a GOP fund-raising dinner Tuesday
night that ``there is no question that progress was made at Malta.''

   Japan's defense budget, already judged the
third-largest in the world, will continue to grow even as the
superpowers talk about cutting back on military spending, officials
say.
   In a region so far immune to dramatic improvements in relations
like those occurring in Europe, Japan has at best cool relations
with the Soviet Union as the two countries are deadlocked over an
old territorial dispute. And the United States is pressing Tokyo to
increase its budgetary support for U.S. forces based in Japan.
   Japan's military budget, always controversial in light of a
constitution that bans war, has grown steadily through the 1980s to
increase the country's ability to fend off Soviet attack.
   ``It is separate from (superpower) arms reductions from that
point of view. So our own efforts for improving our self-defense
are not expected to change at the moment,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe told a news conference Tuesday.

   The glamour is fading from the computer industry
at the close of the 1980s, tarnishing one of the most remarkable
success stories of American business.
   The computer industry has behaved more like the auto or steel
businesses this year, with numerous layoffs and other job
reductions. While sales continue to rise, the single-digit growth
is a comedown for an industry that was accustomed to bounding gains
early in the decade.
   The latest evidence came Tuesday, when International Business
Machines Corp., the world's biggest computer company, announced it
would cut 10,000 U.S. jobs without layoffs because of slow growth
in its home market.
   IBM and independent analysts cite several reasons, including an
economic slowdown and sluggish capital spending by American
companies.

   As the nation's governors try to meet a

leaders of education groups are moving to have some impact on the
finished product.
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
proposed Tuesday that federally financed preschool programs for
poor youngsters integrate nutrition, prenatal care and health
screening.
   Early childhood education should be the primary focus of the
nation, Geiger said in an interview two days before Thursday's

Association,
   And while preschool was included in its recommendations, a
second education group, the Council of the Great City Schools, said
the first priority should be to improve urban schools.

   Federal health officials say laboratory
findings that very high doses of the anti-AIDS drug AZT cause
tumors in aging laboratory rodents should cause little concern for
people with AIDS.
   Dr. James Mason, the top health official at the Department of
Health and Human Services, said that while the results are
significant, they do not show AZT causes cancer in humans.
   ``The Public Health Service still strongly recommends that AIDS
patients ... continue their zidovudine (AZT) therapy under
consultation with their physicians,'' Mason said Tuesday.
   Dan Hoth, director of the AIDS division at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted in the study
conducted by the maker of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome Co., the rodents
received much higher doses of AZT for a much longer time than AIDS
patients do.

   Delta Burke, whose weight gain has sent the
rumor mill and the tabloid press into a frenzy, deals forthrightly
with the issue in an episode of CBS' ``Designing Women'' on Monday.
   Her gain of about 30 pounds in the past two years has unleashed
a fury of phony reports that she has been suspended from the show,
that she's causing trouble on the set and that her six-month-old
marriage to ``Major Dad'' star Gerald McRaney is on the rocks.
   In Monday's episode, her character, Suzanne Sugarbaker, has to
face the fact that she's gotten fat when she is ridiculed at her
high school reunion.
   ``When all this started I was very hurt,'' said Burke. ``I
didn't do anything to deserve this. Why are they so cruel? I went
through a lot of emotions with this. You give yourself pep talks.
Elizabeth Taylor had to put up with this. Every star who's gained
weight has had to put up with this.''
   Burke, who is 33 and 5-foot-5, declines to say what her weight
is. ``It's nowhere near the 200 pounds they say it is,'' she said.
   Elizabeth Taylor was pilloried for getting fat. She finally went
on a well-publicized diet and wrote a book about it. Oprah Winfrey
went public with her diet on her talk show ``Oprah.''
   Winfrey lost 67 pounds and vowed she would not gain it back
because the tabloids would attack her if she did. She has put back
on 17 pounds, however, and devoted another show to the gain.
   John Travolta took off 35 pounds and is in a new hit movie,
``Look Who's Talking.''
   Gil Gerard said in TV Guide that his 75-pound weight gain cost
him $1 million in lost roles. He joined Overeaters Anonymous and
got his weight down to a muscular 200 pounds.
   Some stars, nevertheless, seem unaffected after putting on a few
pounds. Roseanne Barr has a hit show on ABC and says she prefers
being fat to being thin. Her co-star, John Goodman, doesn't lack
for choice roles in major movies. Raymond Burr stars regularly in a
hit series of ``Perry Mason'' movies on NBC.
   William Conrad even stars in a CBS show called ``Jake and the
Fat Man.'' Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson and Shelley Winters are
all getting good roles.
   Burke has not lost any roles, although the tabloids had stories
that she was given ultimatums to lose weight or be kicked off
``Designing Women.''
   ``Every story was a complete fabrication,'' said Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason, creator and co-executive producer of the
comedy series with her husband, Harry Thomason. ``It's like if you
gain weight you have no right to live in America. I wrote this
episode because I want to kick the tabloids right in the teeth. .. .
   ``It's embarrassing to me and all of us at `Designing Women'
that anyone would think we would fire someone for being
overweight.''
   Burke is not only under attack in the press, but some radio disc
jockeys regularly ridicule her. There's even a song that goes,
``Delta Dawn, how many pounds have you put on?''
   ``It's just gotten to the point of a crisis,'' Burke said in an
interview. ``There's been a lot of personal stuff about Mac and me.
I'm not used to personal stuff. Then they began attacking my
career. It's vicious. I've worked hard to build up a good
reputation and they're trashing it.
   ``They said I chased Annie Potts around the set. They said I was
hiding in my dressing room. They said I was suspended for two
weeks. They said CBS gave me ultimatums to lose weight. First they
attacked me, now they're attacking Mac. They said he was feeding
me. That he said I was too fat. That we're having trouble. That
he's kicking me out.''
   A few days after the interview McRaney, whom Burke describes as
``an old-fashioned romanticist,'' rented the ballroom at the
Biltmore Hotel to celebrate their six-month anniversary.
   Burke said she retreated when the press reports first began. ``I
backed off,'' she said. ``I didn't want to help them hurt me. I was
also getting frustrated playing Suzanne. I wanted to show another
side of her. I went to Linda and talked to her about doing a show
on the weight. She wrote this incredible script. Mac read it and
cried.''
   She got a standing ovation from the studio audience at the
taping.
   ``Doing that show was like a cleansing for me,'' she said.
``Obviously I am overweight. That's the only thing the tabloids got
right. It's hard to live your life when you're being scrutinized
and not approved of. You have to change. You back away and you're
not as trusting. I just want to work and live my life.''
   Burke, a former Miss Florida, said people have been telling her
she was fat since she was 16. ``I wasn't overweight,'' she said.
``I was just curvy. I just didn't have the stick figure that's
popular now.'' She said she has spent so much of her life taking
diet pills and going on fad diets that it has ``messed up my
metabolism.''
   ``A quick diet isn't going to help my problem now,'' she said.
``You just gain the weight back. I take a self-defense class every
Monday night and it's giving me more confidence and helping my
self-esteem. What I'm doing is changing my lifestyle. But first I
have to like me and accept me as I am. You can't be perfect in this
life, but you can change and grow and strive to be better.''

   A specialist on asserted apperances and
predictions of the Virgin Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917 sees
monumental religious implications in last week's meeting betweem
the Soviet president and the pope.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ``may have natural reasons for
it, but heaven has supernatural reasons,'' says the Rev. Robert J.
Fox, editor of the quarterly Fatima Family Messenger.
   In the Fatima apperances, Mary predicted Russia's conversion and
a period of world peace, Fox says, and on March 25, 1984, Pope John
Paul II consecrated the world and Russia to Mary's immaculate heart.
   ``Never have we seen such dramatic and rapid changes'' as those
that since have swept Eastern Europe, Fox says, attributing them to
Mary's ``intercecession with her divine son.'' Fox adds:
   ``Russia is going to be the leader of spirituality in the third
millenium.''

   Many religious leaders have charged persectuion
of churches in El Salvador following the murder of six Jesuit
priests and arrests or expulsion of numerous Lutheran and Episcopal
church workers there.
   Some church leaders also called for a halt to U.S. military aid
there. Top officials of nine U.S. religious bodies charged a
``deliberate and calcuated campaigin to intimidate and harass the
churchers.''
   Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning of the Episcopal Church
urged a complete reassessment of U.S. policy in Latin America from
``top to bottom.'' The United Methodist Board of Global Ministries
asked the U.S. government to cut off its ``supply of weapons'' that
are worsening a civil war.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles cited
threats against El Salvador bishops and other church workers on
government-controlled radio and an official's call for removal of

<HEAD>Papal Kiss Transformed Itinerant Musician to Concert Star</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK _ The moment is imbedded in the nation's memory: a
handicapped, young man playing the guitar with his feet and singing
for Pope John Paul II and millions watching on television.
   ``The day is filled with love,'' sang Tony Melendez in Los
Angeles on that September 1987 day. ``Today is like no other day
before. And you and I will never be the same.''
   Suddenly, the pope startled his phalanx of security guards and
climbed over barricades to embrace Melendez and bless with a kiss
the musical talents of the crying man who was once turned away from
the priesthood because he lacked arms with which to celebrate the
Eucharist.
   ``You are giving hope to all of us. My wish to you is to
continue giving this hope to all the people,'' the pope said.
   The kiss made Melendez an instant celebrity, and he went from an
itinerant musician who played for spare change on the streets of
beach towns in Southern California to a sought-after concert artist
and the author of a new book, ``A Gift of Hope'' written with Mel
White.
   ``I think the Lord has something, a mission for myself. I'm not
sure if it's just to give hope to people, like the pope said, to
make music, or maybe just to tell people you can do it: If Tony can
do it, you can do as much, maybe more,'' Melendez said.
   In an interview from his home in Chino, Calif., the 27-year-old
Melendez said his ministry is ``very subtle.
   ``There is no waving of Bibles, no altar calls. Just a guy with
a guitar _ sharing his life.''
   White, his co-author, said sucess has not affected Melendez.
   ``I've written 23 books, most of them about celebrities and Tony
is just the opposite,'' White said. ``He's not heroic. He's just a
simple guy who doesn't want anything to change.''
   He was born in a town in southwestern Nicaragua. His mother,
confusing her pregnancy with the flu, had taken a prescribed
capsule of thalidomide, later found to cause birth defects.
   To obtain medical care, his family emigrated in 1963 to Los
Angeles. Melendez applied at the end of his junior year in high
school to become a priest.
   The Vatican turned him down. Without a thumb and forefinger to
serve the Eucharist, he was told, he could not be a priest.
   But Melendez said his interest in ministry never wavered.
   ``More than just becoming a priest, I wanted to somehow
minister. Any kind of ministry I wanted to do.''
   He played guitar regularly at Mass at two churches, and was
invited to audition to play before the pope.
   Still, up to three weeks before his Sept. 15 date with the pope,
Melendez played with an open guitar case seeking change from
passers-by on the boardwalk at Laguna Beach.
   He recalls in his book that the moment the pope embraced him, a
voice inside him said, ``Yes, it was for this that I was born. It
was for this that I came into the world.''
   He now travels the world in concert tours, has sung at a World
Series and the Summer Olympics in Seoul, has one album out and
another planned for January, and a television movie on his life is
being developed.
   ``I really feel the Lord sending me places that maybe even
priests or nuns cannot go,'' Melendez said.
   A celebrity in his own right, he is able to share special
moments with others, especially those who can empathize with his
physical condition.
   At one concert, a women who could not hear, speak or talk put
her hand on his guitar and started strumming her belly in time to
the music.
   ``I'll never forget that. It was so moving,'' Melendez said.
   In his book, Melendez tells of going back for a concert at the
Universal Amphitheater _ the scene of his triumph with the pope _
and encountering a badly deformed young woman in a wheelchair.
   He said her eyes filled with tears as she struggled to tell him,
``Tony, because of you, we all have hope.''
   Melendez said he did not know what to say.
   ``I wanted to hold her in my absent arms and let my tears mingle
with hers. Instead, armless, I thanked her and walked away.''

<HEAD>Fund Success Formula: Growth Plus Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they plan their strategies for the 1990s,
mutual-fund investors might well find themselves in a quandary.
   Should they place their bets on aggressive stock funds, hoping
that the next decade will keep up the bull-market dramatics of the
'80s? Or should they take a more defensive approach, reasoning that
less ebullient times lie ahead?
   For the ordinary mortal not equipped with the power to foresee
the future, advisers say a compromise could be in order _ a fund
that pursues the dual objectives of growth and income.
   Funds in this category invest heavily in the stock market. But
they generally shy away from shooting for big winners in
speculative, high-risk issues.
   Rather, they tend to focus on established blue chips and other
staid stocks whose size and record suggests they are unlikely to
experience a sudden nosedive.
   In addition, many of those stocks offer more generous dividend
yields than can be found in younger companies, which keep most or
all of the money they make to plow back into the business for
growth.
   A healthy dividend yield theoretically provides support should
the stock market in general run into a prolonged period of weakness.
   Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? One brokerage house goes so far
in its current promotional literature as to bill growth-and-income
funds ``the best of both worlds.''
   ``Looking for long-term growth of capital AND income, without
excessive price volatility?'' it says. ``Growth and income funds
may be for you.''
   The skeptical reader might detect a whiff of exaggeration in any
claim of that sort. Normally, to get high dividend income, you have
to accept relatively modest prospects for capital gains, or vice
versa.
   As in any compromise, in other words, you expect to give up
something to get something in return. Lately, however, growth and
income funds have been defying that time-honored logic.
   According to the Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service,
which monitors the performance of more than 900 mutual funds,
growth and income funds averaged a total return _ capital gains
plus dividends _ of 125 percent from the end of 1983 through the
third quarter of 1989.
   That surpassed the 109.1 percent gain posted by long-term growth
funds; 98.2 percent for funds seeking maximum capital gains, and
97.3 percent investing in stocks mainly for income.
   Since they occurred over a span of nearly six years, it's hard
to dismiss these results as a temporary aberration. Managers of the
best growth and income funds must have been doing something right.
   Also, analysts say, they had help from market conditions. In the
latter half of the 1980s, there has been an extended vogue for the
kind of big-name stocks that growth and income funds like to own.
   Price indexes of utility stocks, another favorite holding,
recently have hit new highs. Perhaps most important of all, these
funds have thrived on a combination of rising stock prices and
falling interest rates _ trends that have not always coincided in
the past.
   Can they keep it up in the new decade? Most observers agree the
answer depends in large measure on whether investment fashions
change.
   From the mid-1970s until the summer of 1983, the atmosphere
favored low-dividend, rapid growth stocks. Sales of mutual funds
specializing in that sector of the market soared just as they were
approaching their peak.
   Were stocks to fall and interest rates rise in some future
period, growth and income funds could find themselves hit with a
double whammy.
   But for now, at least, they can boast that they have allowed
``singles-hitter'' investors to outscore their counterparts who
swing for the fences.

<HEAD>International Banks Commit Funds to Mexican Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's commercial bank creditors have
committed about 90 percent of a financing package for 1989-1992
covering about $48 billion of Mexican medium- and long-term debt,
according to an official announcement.
   The remaining commitments are expected by the end of this week,
Mexican finance undersecretary Angel Gurria and bank representative
William R. Rhodes said in a joint communique Tuesday.
   Rhodes is co-chairman of a 15-member bank committee that reached
a preliminary agreement with Mexico last July and recommended its
approval to Mexico's approximately 400 creditor banks.
   To date, 345 banks have committed to the package, the communique
said. Only two banks, with small exposure, have so far declined to
participate.
   ``We are getting positive responses from some banks that haven't
participated in the process for a number of years,'' Rhodes said.
   Banks' commitments to the three options in the package are
following the pattern anticipated by Rhodes at a press conference
Nov. 14. New money is running between 8 percent and 10 percent of
the total committed. The remainder is split about evenly between
repackaged debt in which either the principal or interest has been
reduced, the announcement said.
   The communique said the signing of the agreements is expected to
start before the end of December, assuming continuing rapid
progress in completing the complex legal documentation.
   The package covers nearly half of Mexico's total $107 billion
foreign debt, second in the developing world to the $120 billion
owed by Brazil.
   The package represents the first significant reduction in a
Third World government's debt to international commercial banks. It
is considered an important step in the Third World debt crisis that
began seven years ago when Mexico announced in August 1982 it was
unable to meet obligations.
   Since then Third World debt has grown to about $1.3 trillion.
   The agreement has also been seen as a test of the Bush
administration's policy for reducing Third World debt and as a
milestone for other countries waiting to renegotiate.
   Under the agreement the creditor banks have three options: a 35
percent reduction in principal, reduction of the interest rate on
loans to 6.25 percent from around 10 percent previously, or
providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what Mexico owes the
bank.

   Here is a history of job-cutting programs at
International Business Machines Corp. since 1986.
   September 1986: IBM announces retirement incentives that add
five years to the age and five years to the length of service of
eligible employees for purposes of calculating retirement benefits.
By the end of 1987, 15,000 employees accept the incentives,
including 13,000 in the United States.
   June 1988: IBM announces separation incentives aimed at
manufacturing and development employees in Tucson, Ariz., and Boca
Raton, Fla., and at headquarters employees across the United
States. About 7,000 U.S. employees accept.
   September 1989: IBM announces separation incentives to employees
in selected skill groups in Owego and Endicott, N.Y., Lexington,
Ky., and Manassas, Va. The company expects 600 to 1,000 to accept
by the end of 1989.
   December 1989: IBM announces it will offer separation incentives
aimed at cutting 10,000 U.S. employees, mainly in staff and support
functions. Employees who accept will receive one week's salary for
each six months of service, up to a maximum of 52 weeks of salary.
The company says most of the employees are expected to leave in the
first half of 1990.

<HEAD>Subscription TV Network Planned for Financial Professionals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subscription television network that will
carry training and information programs for investment
professionals is scheduled to debut in January, the developers of
the service announced.
   The Financial Satellite Network is being marketed to
stockbrokers, bankers, insurance agents and financial planners, and
22 clients with about 240 offices have already signed up, said John
Drossos, chairman and chief executive of the parent company of the
network, Drossos Financial Inc. of San Antonio, Texas.
   Starting Jan. 2, he said, the network will carry four hours of
programs that will be delivered every business day via satellite to
subscribers.
   The subscription cost is $545 a month per site. The network
operators will provide a satellite dish for each site and connect
the dish to all of the televisions in each office. There will be no
advertising on the network.
   Drossos said Tuesday the service is designed to keep brokers and
other financial professionals abreast of the latest market trends
and enhance their sales skills without having to leave the office
for seminars.
   The network will offer 15 rotating series of programs on topics
such as financial planning techniques, legal issues facing brokers
and telemarketing techniques as well as interviews with market
movers, discussions of the latest financial instruments and trading
strategies and motivational lectures.
   The material will be produced by the company, Drossos said. The
network will operate between 12:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. Eastern time
each weekday so employees can watch parts of the program on breaks
or lunch hours.
   Drossos declined to say how much had been invested in the launch
of the network, but said that he hopes to have 1,500 to 2,000
subscribers by the end of the first year.
   Tim Harrington, the president and chief operating officer of
Drossos Financial, said the breakeaven point is about 825
subscribers. He founded Westcott Communications, a satellite
network company that offers subscription networks for automobile
dealers and law enforcement personnel.
   One of the charter subscribers to Financial Satellite Network is
D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., a full-service brokerage in Great Falls, Mont.
   Gerry Meyer, a Davidson vice president, said the main attraction
of the network is that it will expose Davidson brokers to the
latest commentary from some of the country's top investment
professionals.
   ``When you are in Great Falls, Montana, you can't just jump in
cab to go listen to some of these people,'' he said.

   Along with East European freedom seekers, the
Berlin Wall is attracting American admakers.
   In the month since the historic opening of the border between
East and West Germany, admakers for Pepsi-Cola Co., American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and the fragrance marketer Quintessence
have filmed commercials at the wall.
   They said their ads, which will be running through ther holiday
season, are designed to celebrate the exhilaration and emotion of
newly won freedom.
   Pepsi-Cola, the soft drink arm of Pepsico Inc., said Tuesday its
commercial features a documentary-style montage of people
approaching the wall about 10 days after the border was opened in
early November.
   Its admakers tried to ``blend in with the news crews that were
there'' to capture genuine, unscripted moments that exemplified the
joys of freedom, said Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie.
   In the 30-second commercial that was scheduled to debut next
Tuesday night and run repeatedly on network television through Jan.
1, MacKenzie said a young woman is shown handing a flower to a
border guard and a group of young children use small hammers to
chip at the wall. No actors were used in the ad.
   ``In this season of giving, the gift of freedom is the greatest
gift of all,'' a narrator says. The Pepsi-Cola name appears at the
end of the spot but it makes no specific product pitch.
   Admakers for AT&amp;T interviewed people at the wall and near the
border crossing points in Berlin in which they recalled what they
did when the border was opened and how it made them feel.
   A number of those interviewed told how they called friends and
relatives with the news. Those interviews will be intercut with
interviews being shot now in the United States of people who have
relatives in East or West Germany.
   One-minute and 30-second versions of the ad will be made for use
on television starting Dec. 17, according to the admakers.
   ``The idea was that we can help people share their thoughts and
feelings,'' said David Robertson, division manager of advertising
for AT&amp;T in Basking Ridge, N.J.
   The Quintessence ad tells the story about an elderly East German
man crossing the border into West Berlin, evidently to be reunited
with his family and a grandson he may have never seen.
   As the man passes through a checkpoint, his grandson runs toward
him and they embrace. An East German border guard picks up a teddy
bear that the older man dropped and hands it to the youngster.
   The commercial was designed to acquaint people with the name of
the privately-held fragrance company, formerly Beecham Cosmetics,
whose brands include Jovan Musk and Adidas for Men, according to
President Joseph Aramanda.
   ``It is a holiday message that says peace on earth,'' he said.
   The commercial, filmed in late November in West Berlin, debuts
Dec. 12 on network television during a broadcast of CBS' ``Beauty &amp;
The Beast.''
   Victor Zast, senior vice president for marketing at the
Chicago-based Quintessence, said the ad included five West Germans
and 18 East Germans, who were offered the equivalent of $55 to
appear in the ad _ the same as East Germans were getting as a
welcoming gift from the West German government upon arriving in
that nation in the first days after the border was opened.
   ``Crowd control was something of a problem,'' Zast said. But he
said the admakers were ``blessed with a snowstorm'' the morning
they started shooting the ad _ a fitting start to a holiday
commercial.
   In another move marking changing East-West relations, Coca-Cola
Co. this week is airing a slightly altered version of its ``General
Assembly'' commercial for Coca-Cola Classic, which features more
than 1,000 young people from many nations singing a song in 16
languages.
   The song's message, ``Promise us tomorrow, and we'll build a
better world for you,'' marked the 1987 Reykjavik Summit between
former President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The version airing this week carries these words on the screen
at the end: ``Today, as barriers between people come down,
Coca-Cola celebrates the hope of a better tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Key Phone Records Contradict Government; Liv Ullman Testifies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers in the GAF Corp. stock
manipulation trial have introduced newly obtained telephone records
that appear to contradict pivotal government testimony about calls
discussing the alleged fraud.
   GAF attorney Arthur Liman called the records, which previously
were thought to be nonexistent, ``obviously very crucial,
extraordinary.''
   The new evidence indicates no calls were placed on long-distance
WATS lines from the Jefferies &amp; Co. brokerage to GAF or its vice
chairman, James T. Sherwin, during times in October 1986 when the
government alleges the manipulation was discussed.
   The defense rested its case Tuesday after actress Liv Ullman
testified on Sherwin's behalf as the final witness in the
seven-week criminal trial in Manhattan federal court.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin are charged with allegedly
trying to boost Union Carbide Corp.'s share price in 1986 shortly
before selling a large block of the stock after a failed takeover
bid. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and
conspiracy.
   The case is in its third trial after two mistrials earlier this
year.
   Jefferies &amp; Co. trading director James T. Melton has testified
he called Sherwin between 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Oct. 29, 30 and
31 in 1986 _ shortly after the Pacific Stock Exchange closed _ to
discuss actions taken those days to close the stock above $22 a
share, as allegedly ordered by Sherwin.
   Other calls to Sherwin to discuss the scheme allegedly were made
while he was at his doctor's office and at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   But American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. records introduced Monday
indicate that no calls were made during the half hour in question
on any of Jefferies &amp; Co.'s 15 WATS lines to GAF or Sherwin or to
the other offices.
   Liman said the records contradicted testimony by Melton and his
trading assistant, Maureen O'Connor, who said Melton called Sherwin
``within moments'' of the market's close.
   Defense lawyers said privately they believe the new information
shows that the calls to Sherwin never were made. No records of the
calls appeared on Jefferies &amp; Co.'s regular long-distance telephone
bills either.
   The defense called an AT&amp;T supervisor who retrieved the records
and a private investigator who analyzed them on the witness stand.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr. did not attempt to
rebut the testimony.
   The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize
profits after a failed takeover attempt by Wayne, N.J.-based GAF of
much larger Union Carbide. GAF, a specialty chemicals company, held
10 million shares of Union Carbide after the failed bid and sold 5
million in November 1986 for $23 a share.
   Ullman testified she has known Sherwin 10 years through work on
a refugee settlement organization, the International Rescue
Committee. Ullman is a vice president of the group and Sherwin is
chairman of its executive committee.
   ``I would say he is, from my heart, the most honorable, moral
man I have ever met,'' the Norwegian film star said under
questioning from Sherwin's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman.
   Ullman, who has appeared in such films as director Ingemar
Bergman's ``Cries and Whispers'' and ``Scenes From a Marriage,''
testified for about 10 minutes about her career, extensive human
rights work and association with Sherwin.
   Afterward, she talked briefly with Sherwin and kissed him on the
cheek before leaving the courthouse.
   Closing arguments in the trial were expected to last two days
and the case could go to the jury for deliberations Friday.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. has little to say about a
lawsuit that claims the company artificially depressed its stock
price last month by not quickly disclosing a Japanese patent
potentially worth billions of dollars.
   The class-action suit filed in Dallas federal court Monday
claimed the company misrepresented its financial prospects by not
disclosing that it had been granted the patent in Japan for the
basic computer chip.
   Industry analysts estimate that the patent, which was issued
Oct. 30, could generate $100 million to $300 million in annual
royalties from Japanese companies until it expires in November 2001.
   The lawsuit alleges that Texas Instruments knew about the
Japanese patent ruling as early as August and that the company
should have mentioned it in a third-quarter earnings report
released Oct. 20.
   Texas Instruments did not inform investors about the patent
until after a Japanese business newspaper reported the story Nov.
21.
   Because investors were not told of the prospects for the
Japanese patent, the earnings report contained
``misrepresentations'' about Texas Instruments' prospects of
increased revenues from royalties, according to the lawsuit.
   Texas Instruments spokesman Stan Victor said Monday that the
company ``is confident that it has fully complied with U.S.
disclosure requirements.'' Victor declined further comment.
   On Nov. 20, the day before the Japanese patent became public
knowledge, Texas Instruments announced plans to take a $55 million
write-down in fourth-quarter earnings and to lay off up to 1,500
domestic employees.
   Texas Instruments stock closed at $29 a share on Nov. 20 but
rose to $36 by the close of trading Nov. 22, following the patent
announcement.
   The suit was brought by an investor, Margot Broza of New York,
who had purchased five options to sell Texas Instruments stock in
November.
   She claims to represent all investors who sold Texas Instruments
stock or bought options on Texas Instruments stock between Oct. 20
and Nov. 22. More than 14 million Texas Instruments shares were
traded by thousands of investors during the period.
   The suit seeks compensatory damages resulting from the trading
of undervalued stock.
   Jerry Junkins, Texas Instruments president and chief executive
officer; Bill George, a TI executive vice president; and John
Toomay, a TI director, also were named as defendants.
   George purchased 1,000 Texas Instruments shares at $30 each on
Nov. 9 and Toomay purchased 500 shares at $31.50 apiece on Oct. 30.

<HEAD>Strategy Down Sharply in Early November After Backlash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Program trading activity dropped sharply in the
first two weeks of November after a backlash against the
controversial strategy, which is blamed by some for causing market
turmoil.
   New York Stock Exchange figures released Tuesday showed a steep
decline in index arbitrage, the main form of computerized program
trading, reflecting an exodus by large brokerages from the strategy
after it came under fire following the sharp stock market drop of
Oct. 13.
   Index arbitrage accounted for 38.7 percent of program trades
from Nov. 6-10 and 25.7 percent from Nov. 13-17, down from 53.8
percent in all of October, the Big Board said in its first weekly
reports on program trading.
   The NYSE is releasing the data as part of a series of moves to
control stock market volatility implemented after the sudden
190-point market decline on Friday the 13th and an 80-point rise
Oct. 24.
   The new figures also indicated a large jump in program trading
compared with the rest of the week during a sharp intraday decline
on Nov. 6, when the Dow Jones industrials average fell 30 points
from the previous day's close at 11:15 a.m.
   The Big Board said program trading accounted for 13.6 percent,
or 1.94 million shares, of 14.3 million shares traded from 11 a.m.
to 11:30 a.m.
   As part of its weekly report, the NYSE said it will profile
program trading activity for half-hour periods when the Dow drops
30 points from the previous day's close or moves 30 points in a
single direction.
   Since the NYSE does not break down program trading daily, it is
not possible to determine whether the amount of program trading in
the half-hour period on Nov. 6 exceeded program trading the rest of
the day.
   Overall in the first weekly report, program trading strategies
accounted for 6.7 million of an average daily NYSE volume of 148.8
million shares, or 4.5 percent. Buy programs totaled 3.0 million
shares and sell programs 3.7 million, the exchange said.
   For the second week, the trading totaled 7.9 percent of an
average daily volume of 147.7 million shares, or 11.6 million
shares a day. Buy programs accounted for 7.7 million shares and
sell programs for 3.9 million shares.
   The Big Board defines program trading as any order for the
simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks. Index arbitrage
involves rapid trading of stocks in New York and stock-index
futures in Chicago to profit from momentary price discrepancies
between the two markets.
   Critics say index arbitrage exaggerates market movements,
triggering waves of selling and sometimes buying. Defenders say the
strategy helps stabilize trading by linking the two markets,
pulling prices closer together.
   The new NYSE figures showed a drop in program trading from
October, when the strategies accounted for 9.7 percent of daily
NYSE volume of 182.4 million shares, or 17.7 million shares a day.
   The exchange began compiling program trading volume on a monthly
basis in August 1988. The lowest monthly total to date was 7.6
percent last April.
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which ceased index arbitrage for its own
account but continues it for customers, was the leader in the
trading, with 10.9 million shares for Nov. 6-10 and 23.2 million
shares Nov. 13-17. Salomon Brothers Inc. was a distant second with
4.9 million shares traded the first week and 4.5 million the second.

<HEAD>Sales Slump Continues; One Analysts Blames New Models</HEAD>

   A 9.3 percent decline in late-November sales of
North American-made cars and light trucks continues a downward
trend that one analyst says reflects boredom among consumers over
the new model lineup.
   The eight major automakers with U.S. assembly plants reported
Tuesday they sold vehicle at an average daily rate of 37,059 during
Nov. 21-30, compared with 40,843 a day on average during the same
time last year.
   Car sales were down 12.5 percent and light truck sales were off
3.8 percent.
   The slump during the 10-day period continues a decline that
began in early October, just as the 1990 model year got under way.
   ``There's not a lot of excitement left in the industry,'' said
auto analyst Paul Kleinaitis of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
``Everybody's got sort of the same cars.''
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., which
make up more than three-quarters of the North American-produced
auto market, reported their combined car and truck sales fell 14
percent during the period this year compared with last year.
   For the month of November, with imported cars and trucks counted
in, vehicle sales fell 11.9 percent, with car sales dropping 13.5
percent and light truck sales off 8.5 percent.
   Through the first 11 months of this year, domestic and import
car and truck sales were running 4.5 percent behind last year's
pace, with car sales down 5 percent and light truck sales off 3.2
percent.
   GM said sales of its North American-built cars fell 24 percent
and light truck sales declined 15.1 percent.
   ``Since about the first of October, we've had less traffic,''
said Frank DeBartolo, general sales manager of Celozzi-Ettleson
Chevrolet-Geo in Elmhurst, Ill. ``The last quarter has taken quite
a bite out of us.''
   Last summer, automakers were faced with swollen new-car
inventories, prompting them to lay on incentive packages to move
the vehicles out of showrooms. The incentives, coupled with news of
pending price increases when the 1990 models began rolling into
dealer lots in early October, forced some people to buy 1989 models
rather than 1990s.
   That resulted in some fourth-quarter sales being stolen by the
third quarter.
   ``What we're seeing now, however, is more than payback for the
pull-ahead,'' said Ford's sales Vice President Robert Rewey. ``Some
prospective buyers are deferring purchases due to uncertainty about
the economic outlook.
   ``More than anything else, that uncertainty is fueled by high
interest rates.''
   DeBartolo said he expected the 1990 sales slump to end in a
month or two, mainly because he sees no long-term economic downturn.
   ``As far as the economy goes, everything is stable,'' he said.
``There's nothing drastic that's going to happen.''
   GM's combined domestic car and truck sales were down 21.1
percent in late November this year compared with last year. For the
entire year, GM's car and truck sales were down 5.5 percent.
   Ford said its late-November vehicle sales were 6.1 percent
behind last year's pace, as car sales dropped 8.7 percent and light
truck sales fell 2.6 percent.
   Through November of this year, Ford's car and truck sales were
running 2.6 percent lower than during the first 11 months of last
year.
   Chrysler said its late-November car sales fell 15.7 percent but
its truck sales during the period rose 1.6 percent, combining for a
7 percent decrease. Year-to-date sales of Chrysler cars and light
trucks were running 6.4 percent below last year's pace.

<HEAD>Stocks Hit Another Record High, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at a
record high today for the 10th time in the last 11 trading days,
while the dollar rose marginally against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 160.12 points, or 0.43
percent, closing at 37,654.29. It had gained 190.30 points on
Tuesday in its current record-setting run, which paused only Friday.
   Today, the index dipped in early trading on selling to take
profits, but Daiwa Securities dealer Kazuyuki Suzuki said
investors' buying incentives were much stronger than their concerns
over the rapid increase in share prices.
   ``It seems the index just could not stop rising,'' he said,
adding that it probably will reach 38,000 by the year's end.
   On the first section, an estimated 1.2 billion shares changed
hands, down from Tuesday's 1.3 billion. Among gainers were
electrical, housing and chemical shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.75 yen, up 0.07
yen from Tuesday's close of 143.68 yen. It opened at 143.72 yen and
stayed in a narrow range between 143.65 yen and 143.76 yen. The
dollar now has climbed 0.85 yen in the last four days.
   ``The range is just getting narrower and narrower,'' Mitsui Bank
trader Yoshitsugu Hanada said, attributing this to a lack of fresh
market-affecting news.
   Spot trading totaled $3.1 billion, down from Tuesday's $4.1
billion.
   The dollar also moved little against the West German mark
despite traders' expectations that the U.S. currency would weaken
against the mark, Hanada said.
   ``It didn't work that way here because Japanese investors still
have strong demand for the dollar,'' he said.
   He added that recent currency rates were influenced more by
investors' supply and demand, rather than economic trends.
   Thus Friday's announcement of U.S. unemployment figures for
November will have little impact on the market, he said.

   The dollar was little changed in trendless
European trading early today. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the dollar was trading within a narrow range as
traders moved to the sidelines to await further signs of the health
of the U.S. economy.
   U.S. unemployment figures for November due to be released Friday
could provide a fresh view of the economy and shed light on the
future policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar edged up 0.07 Japanese yen to a closing 143.75
yen. Later, in London, it inched up further to 143.77 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
quotes, included: 1.7767 West German marks, down from 1.7790;
1.5927 Swiss francs, up from 1.5910; 6.0652 French francs, down
from 6.0675; 2.0034 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0100; 1,308.25
Italian lire, up from 1,307.00; and 1.1622 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1640.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5742 from $1.5715 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $401.10 a troy ounce,
down from $404 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $402.05.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $402.80, down from $403.50 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.15 to close at a bid $400.71.
   Silver fell sharply in London to a bid price of $5.54 a troy
ounce, down from $5.60 bid late Tuesday.

   Fast food is serious stuff to Don Smith,
the Taco Bell Distinguished Professor at Washington State
University. There are no easy A's in Burger Flipping 101 here.
   ``We are a business school,'' says Smith, who holds what is
believed to be the first university endowment paid for by a
fast-food chain. In his classes, students study market research and
motivational training, not milkshake theory or the physics of
french fries.
   Fast food is big business, Smith said, with $60 billion in
annual sales. And that is of more than academic interest to his
students.
   ``The number one thing that drives a student in our college is
career,'' he said. ``That may not be what academics like ... but
our kids come here so they can get out of here and improve their
state of living.''
   Graduates of Smith's program leave with five or six career
offers, he said, with salaries starting at $20,000 a year and
rising to more than $30,000 after three years.
   Of this year's 90 graduates from the university's hotel and
restaurant administration program, 18 entered the fast-service
industry.
   One such former student is Scott Fisher, a Taco Bell district
manager in the Seattle area.
   Fisher, who says he makes ``damn good money'' and drives a
Corvette, thinks more colleges should offer career training for the
fast-service industry.
   ``There's a lot of engineers coming out of colleges, but at two
years out of college I was making more than an engineer,'' said
Fisher, who supervises 120 employees at five restaurants that do a
combined $4 million worth of business annually.
   ``Where is a 24-year-old going to get that kind of chance?''
Smith asked. ``Fast food.''
   Taco Bell Corp. gave Washington State a $250,000 endowment this
year _ matched by a state grant _ to increase the number of trained
professionals in the industry and conduct academic research.
   Smith, 60, was chosen last month after the university advertised
the post nationally and reviewed about 40 applicants. He has a
master's degree in education from the University of Illinois and
has been teaching at Washington State's hotel and restaurant school
since 1986.
   Smith knows the fast-food business from bitter experience. His
attempt to open a taco restaurant in the 1960s was less than a
rousing success.
   ``I didn't know the farmers in DeKalb, Illinois, didn't like
tacos,'' he recalled with a laugh.
   He went on to a successful 13 years as managing partner of a
Chicago restaurant, Chateau Louise, and then became director of new
ventures for Kentucky Fried Chicken, served as president of the
Shakey's Pizza chain and moved on to become director of the School
of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management at Michigan State
University.
   He approaches every task with the energy and enthusiasm that
made him a successful high school football coach in the 1950s. Some
of the management skills he teaches students come straight from the
locker room.
   Successful fast-food managers must give their teen-age employees
self-confidence, just as a coach must do, Smith said.
   ``When you can enhance a teen-ager's self-esteem, they'll kill
themselves for you,'' he said. ``And by the way, money ranks fourth
in what motivates them.''
   While the workforce is young, Smith said the average age of
fast-service customers is rising.
   ``The customer is what counts, that middle-class American who is
time-poor, doesn't want to spend money for tipping, but wants good
quality food,'' he said.
   Smith's students don't learn cooking skills at school; their
courses focus more on managerial topics such as market research,
which he believes is a key to success in the restaurant business.
   ``Fast-fooders are consumer research-focused,'' he said.
``McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King, Taco Bell, Pizza
Hut _ they know more about where their customer's head is and where
it is going, and they're building their menus to suit those
customers.
   ``We've had a lot of skeptics about fast service, but you know,
what it amounts to is real simple _ the American public doesn't
listen, they vote with their pocketbooks. And fast food has grown
faster and continues to grow twice as fast as the entire industry.''

<HEAD>Canadian Pacific Intends to Spin Off Unit, Adopts Poison Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it intends to spin
off its real estate portfolio valued at more than $3 billion and
has adopted an anti-takeover defense.
   President William Stinson said Tuesday that the company knew of
no takeover threats but decided to adopt a ``poison pill'' as a
pre-emptive measure.
   Rumors circulated last summer about an impending takeover of the
Montreal-based conglomerate which has interests in numerous aspects
of the Canadian economy including transportation, energy, forest
products, telecommunications and real estate.
   Analysts say Canadian Pacific would be rich pickings for a
raider with an eye on dismantling it. Possible buyers mentioned in
rumors were the British conglomerate Hanson PLC and Montreal's Paul
Desmarais, president of cash-rich Power Corp.
   Canadian Pacific plans to spin off its Marathon Realty Co.,
turning it into a publicly traded company. Eighty percent of
Marathon will be distributed to Canadian Pacific shareholders and
the remaining 20 percent will be retained by Canadian Pacific,
which will help Marathon in developing the potential of its
property holdings.
   The distribution was approved in principle by Canadian Pacific's
board of directors on Tuesday. The plan will be implemented once it
is approved by shareholders and after certain other conditions are
met.
   Canadian Pacific said the book value of Marathon's assets is
about 2.1 Canadian dollars but internal estimates indicate its
current market value exceeds 4 billion Canadian dollars, or about
$3.43 billion.
   Meanwhile, the company also announced Tuesday that ``upon the
occurrence of certain triggering events'' stockholders will have
the right to acquire shares at 50 per cent of market value _ a move
that would significantly dilute stock value.
   The events include acquisition of 10 per cent or more of
ordinary shares, or of ordinary and preferred shares, by a buyer
who doesn't have approval from the board of directors.
   Canadian Pacific said the aim of the plan is to ensure
shareholders get the most for their stock under any takeover.
   Stinson, at a gathering of financial analysts in Toronto,
emphasized the posion pill is a pre-emptive measure and he is not
aware of ``any pending or threatened takeover bids for the company.
   ``I don't know of any action in the stock that would suggest an
impending takeover. It's been quiet of late,'' he said.
   Poison pills, used for the first time in Canada by Inco Ltd.
last fall but widely prevalent in the United States, are aimed at
discouraging hostile takeovers by burdening a company with debt or
triggering a dilution of stock.
   Canadian Pacific's poison pill must be approved at the company's
annual meeting next May.
   Canadian Pacific shares closed on the Toronto Stock Exchange on
Tuesday at 25.12 Canadian dollars, down 12 cents.

   The stock market was mixed in relatively subdued
early trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 2.35 points to

<HEAD>Eds: Top six grafs new from NABE news conference; picks up 5th graf

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy will continue to weaken next
year but there will be neither a recession nor any substantial
change in unemployment, the nation's top business economists
predicted today in a forecast their president said was the most
enthusiastic ever.
   The National Association of Business Economists said a survey of
its members found 62 percent expecting no recession for the next
three years.
   ``It's a sea-change,'' said James F. Smith, NABE president and
finance professor at the University of North Carolina. ``We never
ever had, not just a majority, but an overwhelming majority
forecasting growth over three years.''
   However, nearly 20 percent of the respondents said a recession
will occur either by the end of the year or during the first three
months of 1990, ending an unprecedented peacetime economic
expansion that began its eighth year this month.
   The new report was considerably more optimistic than last May's
survey, which found 63 percent of the economists expecting a
recession next year. Three months later, 37 percent of the
economists still forecast recession in 1990.
   Smith said the last time the NABE survey correctly forecast a
recession was in 1980, when it predicted the 1981-82 economic
downturn. But he added that since 1983, the economists have been
within one percentage point of forecasting the following year's
gross national product.
   In the November survey, the consensus among the 59 respondents
was that the gross national product _ the nation's total output of
goods and services _ would continue to grow slowly, dropping from
the 2.9 percent forecast for 1989 to 1.8 percent next year.
   The survey also showed an easing of inflation fears, with
predictions that the consumer price index will fall from 4.8
percent forecast for 1989 to 4.2 percent next year.
   At the same time, the economists expect interest rates would
continue to fall, with rates on three-month Treasury bills dropping
from 8.1 percent in 1989 to 7.1 percent in 1990. For 30-year
Treasury bonds, the expected estimate is 7.8 percent next year,
compared with 8.4 percent this year.
   The economy has slowed considerably this year as the Federal
Reserve boosted interest rates to restrain rising prices. But it
began in June to gradually let rates fall as inflationary pressures
moderated.
   The manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by Fed
actions, and the economists forecast continued weakness in
industrial production.
   But their report said ``the slower overall growth and weaker
industrial production is not expected to be reflected in higher
unemployment.''
   The survey suggested unemployment would rise only from 5.3
percent this year to 5.5 percent next year. That was down from the
5.8 percent predicted in their May survey and 5.7 percent in August.
   The housing industry, hurt by higher interest rates earlier this
year, is expected to improve modestly, with housing starts rising
from 1.4 million in 1989 to 1.45 million in 1990, the economists
said.
   But they foresee no relief for the automobile industry, a third
sector in the economic doldrums. Car and small truck sales, they
said, would drop from 15.1 million this year to 14.7 million in
1990.
   The NABE report also suggested changes in the expected
composition of the GNP in 1990.
   ``Consumer demand is expected to constitute a significantly
larger share of growth while investment, reflecting a deteriorating
outlook for corporate profits, is expected to weaken,'' it said.
   The NABE also said its forecasters predicted the nation's twin
deficits in merchandise trade and the federal budget would narrow,
but ``only very slowly.''
   ``For 1990, the trade imbalance should be about $100 billion
(down from $109 billion in 1989) and federal spending will exceed
revenue by $141 billion (after a reported $152 billion in fiscal
1989),'' it said.

<HEAD>Banks Lost $744 Million in Third Quarter This Year</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New material, editing to trim, throughout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's commercial banks lost $744
million in the third quarter this year, the first loss in more than
two years, the government said today.
   The bulk of the red ink was concentrated in several large banks
that set aside new reserves for expected losses on loans to Third
World nations, as well as in rising real estate loan problems in
the Northeast and Arizona, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman also said the insurance fund
protecting deposits at 12,824 U.S. banks likely will record the
second loss in its history this year. The fund declined by about $4
billion in 1988 and will shrink by an additional $250 million to
$500 million this year, he said.
   Bank failures, totaling 192 so far this year, likely will
approach but not exceed last year's record of 211, Seidman said.
Based on a fall in the number of problem banks from 1,394 at the
start of 1989 to 1,134 at the end of September, he predicted the
failure rate would decline next year.
   Seidman said banks should approach commercial and development
real estate lending more cautiously. Although bank profits overall
likely will bounce back in the final three months of 1989, the
number of sour real estate loans will continue to rise, he
predicted.
   ``I don't want to Scrooge up Christmas ... but I'm afraid the
fourth quarter will show a continuation of the (real estate) trends
we see here,'' Seidman said.
   The loss in the July-September period compares with profits of
$7 billion in the second quarter and $7.3 billion in the first
quarter. Last year banks earned a record profit of $25.2 billion.
   Commercial banks last recorded a loss in the second quarter of
1987. Red ink totaled $10.6 billion and was attributed to losses on
developing country lending.
   Some of the nation's largest banks again took writedowns in the
third quarter on their loans to developing countries. J.P. Morgan &amp;
Co. increased its loss reserves by $2 billion, Chase Manhattan
Corp. by $1.3 billion and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corp. by $950
million.
   Analysts attributed the writedowns to banks' recognition that
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's debt strategy will require
them to accept more losses.
   Brady's plan, launched in March, emphasizes debt reduction as
well as new lending to developing countries. However, critics of
the plan worry that banks will be reluctant to make new loans after
recognizing big losses.
   Commercial real estate lending problems, common in the Southwest
since the mid-1980s, are spreading elsewhere. In August, Moody's
Investor Service warned that involvement in real estate lending
makes large banks vulnerable to rising interest rates or a
recession.
   In a speech Tuesday, Seidman called real estate lending is ``an
emerging area of concern'' and said his agency was studying real
estate markets nationwide.
   ``Over the last 12 months, real estate loan growth has accounted
for nearly two-thirds of all bank asset growth, and now comprises
almost one-fourth of all commercial bank assets,'' Seidman told a
meeting of the National Council of Savings Institutions in New York.
   Delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sour
loans nationally, he said. In the Northeast, the percentage of
delinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year, he said.

<HEAD>Corn and Wheat Prices Grain on Expectation of Increased Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and futures were higher in early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices climbed as traders reacted to news that the
Agriculture Department has targeted China for 1 million metric tons
of wheat under the export bonus program.
   Prices also were expected to get a boost from continued dry
conditions in the winter wheat crop area.
   Follow-through buying by commercial houses gave corn prices some
support, said analyst Martyn Foreman of AgriVisor Service Inc. in
Bloomington, Ill.
   Foreman said traders also were encouraged by optimistic
pronouncements by negotiators attending the U.S.-Soviet grain talks.
   Despite opening higher, analysts say soybeans looked weak
because of a lack of export business, and news that Argentine
farmers are enjoying adequate soil moisture and are moving ahead
with soybean planting.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.06\ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.35 a bushel; oats were
\ cent to { cent higher with December at $1.44} a bushel; soybeans
were \ cent to 1{ cents higher with January at $5.76 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Light beef demand at the retail level was a drag on cattle
futures, as were lower cash prices.
   Hog futures were pressured by mixed pork product prices,
although support came from an announcement that the Commodity
Credit Corp has accepted offers in its latest weekly tender for
1.48 million pounds of bellies.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .18 cent higher with December
at 75.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .08
cent higher with January at 82.75 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent
to .15 cent lower with December at 51.12 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .02 cent lower to .45 cent higher with February at
55.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled higher and pork futures were mixed in
Tuesday's trading.

   Control Data Corp. President Lawrence
Perlman has been named to the additional position of chief
executive officer, the computer services company said Wednesday.
   Perlman succeeds Robert M. Price, who will remain chairman of
the board, Price said in a prepared statement. Perlman begins his
new duties Jan. 1.
   Price said Perlman has shown ``the kind of exceptional strategic
vision and managerial prowess that was essential in helping to turn
this company around ... and I have every confidence that he is the
right man to lead Control Data forward.''
   Perlman was named president and chief operating officer of
Control Data in December 1988. Previously, he had been president of
Control Data's disk drive operation. In that capacity, he
transformed what was an ailing division into a profitable
operation, Price said.
   In October, Control Data credited extensive restructuring for
third-quarter earnings of $9.8 million, compared with a $2.4
million earnings loss in the same 1988 period. For the first nine
months of this year, the company reported a loss of $484 million,
compared with earnings of $14.5 million for the 1988 period.
   A $497 million loss in the second quarter of this year was
forecast by the company in April when it shut down the ETA Systems
supercomputer subsidiary and cut 3,100 jobs. Closing the St.
Paul-based ETA cost Control Data around $335 million. The balance
of the charges came from shrinking the Cyber mainframe division,
paying severance to cover corporate staff layoffs and the company's
departure from the training and education business, the company
said then.

<HEAD>GM Temporarily Shutting Canadian Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors of Canada Ltd. said Wednesday it
was temporarily shutting down some Canadian assembly and component
plants in early January because of soft vehicle demand mostly in
the United States.
   About 17,700 workers would be affected, the company said.
   GM of Canada spokesman Nick Hall said by telephone the company's
two car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario, and its full-size van
plant in Scarborough, Ontario, would be closed for the week of Jan.
2.
   He also said the Ste. Therese, Quebec, car assembly plant would
be closed for two weeks beginning at the same time. Two component
plants will be shut down briefly this month.
   ``It's just a softening in the market,'' Hall said.
``Seventy-five (percent) to 80 percent of what we make goes to the
U.S.''
   U.S. car and light truck sales have taken a nosedive since Oct.
1.
   The two car assembly operations at Oshawa make the Chevrolet
Lumina coupe and sedan and the Buick Regal, and together employ
about 9,000 hourly workers. Hall declined to say how many unsold
cars were on dealer lots.
   The Ste. Therese plant employs about 3,200 hourly workers and
makes the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and the Chevrolet Celebrity
station wagon. The Scarborough van plant has about 2,300 hourly
employees and the two component plants employ about 3,200 people
together.
   Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly newsletter of the auto
industry, said that as of Oct. 31, 1989, the latest figures
available, U.S. dealers had a 67-day supply of Luminas and a
163-day supply of Regals.
   It also said inventory on the Celebrity station wagon stood at
88 days and dealers had a 66-day supply of Cieras on hand.
   The Ciera and Lumina inventories were among the lowest in their
segment, and Regal's was among the highest.

<HEAD>Say Renault-Volvo Merger Talks Stall, No Partnership Seen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merger negotiations have nearly collapsed between
the state-owned Renault automaker and Sweden's Volvo, and both
companies are seeking other possible partners.
   French Industry Minister Roger Fauroux disclosed the stalled
negotiations Tuesday, leaving the two automakers vulnerable in the
face of intensifying competition in Europe.
   ``No one should expect a large-scale operation or a global
linkup in the coming weeks,'' he told a news conference. ``That
would be an illusion.''
   The companies have been talking for several months on
collaboration that might eventually have led to a full merger of
their car and truck building activities.
   One possible outcome would have given Renault control of Volvo's
car activities while the Swedish group would have been given
responsibility for Renault's RVI truck division.
   Fauroux told reporters that although the talks have entered what
he called a less active phase, ``This does not mean that we cannot
arrive at a partial solution.'' He did not elaborate on what a
partial solution might mean.
   French auto industry analysts said it now appears that the two
groups have limited the scope of their negotiations to possible
technical or commercial cooperation. They said the Swedes
apparently balked over the idea of such a large chunk of Swedish
industry coming under the French national flag.
   Volvo and Renault already have a joint venture that manufactures
car engines, while Volvo acts as Renault's distributor in Sweden.

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it has closed its

   The plant in the Makati area near Manila's financial district _

   P&amp;G's general office in Manila was closed Friday.

was no damage to our property.''
   P&amp;G's main soap and detergent plant in Manila, in the Tondo area
about 15 miles from the financial district, continued to operate,
spokesmen said.
   Hayes said P&amp;G has about 1,200 employees at its Manila

   Chrysler Corp. wants to sell its
Gulfstream business aircraft and defense electronics operations to
cut costs and focus on the increasingly fierce car and truck
marketing fray, Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said Wednesday.
   ``We intend to go head to head with the Toyotas and Hondas of
the world as well as anybody else in the market,'' Iacocca said.
   Allen E. Paulson, chairman of Chrysler's Gulfstream Aerospace
unit, said he was resigning from Chrysler's board and taking a
leave of absence to consider bidding for some or all of the
operations of Gulfstream's parent company, Chrysler Technologies
Corp.
   Chrysler Technologies includes Gulfstream Aerospace, maker of
business aircraft including the Gulfstream IV jet; and Electrospace
Systems and Airborne Systems, makers of communications, control and
intelligence systems for planes, ships and ground installations.
   Chrysler said it intends to concentrate its resources on its
core car and truck operations and related financial business,
Chrysler Financial Corp.
   First Boston Corp. has been engaged to advise on the proposed
sale of Chrysler Technologies, though no timetable has been set,
the company said.
   ``The car and truck market is going to be fiercely competitive
in the years ahead,'' Iacocca said. ``The only way to succeed in
this kind of environment is to concentrate all our energies and
resources ....''
   Chrysler, the third-largest U.S. automaker behind General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Corp., reported 1988 revenue of $35.5 billion.

<HEAD>Witness Says Honeywell Also Sought Secret Budget Info from Pentagon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New material, editing throughout with testimony. Also moved
on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees in Honeywell Inc.'s Washington
area office were pressured by their supervisors in the late 1970s
and early 1980s to obtain secret budget documents from the
Pentagon, a federal court jury was told today.
   Retired Honeywell employee Frank Lozito testified that among
those he received documents from was former Boeing Co. worker
Richard Lee Fowler, who is on trial on charges of illegally
obtaining budget documents from the Pentagon.
   Folwer has pleaded innocent to 39 counts, including conspiracy,
illegal conveyance of classfied documents and mail fraud. Boeing
has pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents and has agreed
to pay a $5.2 million fine.
   Lozito said he was asked by his supervisor to get classified Air
Force budget documents and turned to Fowler, an old friend, for
help.
   ``Honeywell worked on a management-by-objective system,'' Lozito
said of his Minneapolis-based employer.
   Lozito said one of his objectives was to ``establish meaningful
contacts with the Air Force,'' and that meant getting classified
documents containing budget information the Pentagon used to plan
its spending.
   Such material could help defense contractors, such as Boeing and
Honeywell, in bidding for defense projects by giving them inside
information on what the Pentagon would want.
   Lozito said he got documents from Fowler five or 10 times a
year, from 1979 to early 1984.
   Fowler often passed him documents on the street outside Boeing's
Arlington, Va., office, Lozito said, adding that he copied the
documents and returned the originals to Fowler.
   Donna Fountain, a senior security administrator for Honeywell,
testified that in the early 1980s, she was ordered to keep a
separate log of classified documents that Lozito and others brought
into the Honeywell office.
   The log was kept in a separate case that was ``not available''
to Defense Investigative Service inspectors, who worked for the
Pentagon, she said.
   Ms. Fountain said the documents were kept in the personal safes
of the employees involved and were removed from Honeywell offices
before such inspections.
   ``I thought it was part of the old boy network, friends helping
friends,'' Ms. Fountain said. ``I believed it was quite widespread
in the industry.''
   Both Ms. Fountain and Lozito testified with guaranteed immunity
from prosecution by U.S. attorneys.
   Fowler's attorneys have said their client was hired specifically
to get the documents for Boeing, they were readily available to
defense contractors, rules covering their release were unclear and
charges were filed against him only after he refused to tell
Defense Investigative Services inspectors who gave him the
documents.
   Fowler worked for Boeing from 1979 until he was fired in 1986.
   Three former Boeing security employees testified Tuesday that
classified material was logged at the Seattle-based aerospace
company's office in the Washington suburb of Arlington.
   They said Pentagon inspectors never raised questions about the
documents listed in the logs.
   Deborah Null, who was a clerk at the Arlington office from 1978
to 1984, testified that inspectors reviewed Boeing's classified
record log twice a year and the log included specific references to
the documents Fowler is accused of obtaining illegally.
   Ms. Null also said that even though military rules required that
she have receipts from the Pentagon before entering the documents
in the log, DIS officials and Boeing employees including Fowler
said it was no problem if she didn't.

<TEXT>
   Oil company Saga Petroleum AS said Wednesday
that development planning for its $1 billion Midgard offshore field
has been shelved until buyers are found for its natural gas
reserves.
   Plans for Midgard, in the Haltenbanken province off mid-Norway,
hinged on selling enough natural gas to Sweden and eastern Norway
to justify building a $2.2 billion pipeline.
   Lengthy negotiations with Sweden on sales showed that the
pipeline would be unprofitable, said the Norwegian company in a
press release. Migard is one of several fields under consideration
at Haltenbanken.
   Midgard is owned by Saga; the Norwegian state oil company
Statoil AS; AS Norske Shell; Arco Norge AS; and Deminex Norge AS.

<HEAD>Iran To Invest 3.4 Billion Dollars In Petrochemicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's minister of economy and finance
said Wednesday the government has earmarked some $3.4 billion in
credits for petrochemical projects in the next five years.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported
Mohsen Nourbakhsh as saying that the investment is geared toward
self-sufficiency in petrochemicals. He said surplus production
would be exported.
   The large investments in petrochemicals are designed to cut an
annual $2 billion and to generate foreign exchange through exports.
   Speaking to a group of senior banking officials, Nourbakhsh said
the banks should invest in petrochemical, water and soil projects
in the five-year plan.
   The five-year development plan was launched in March, but after
his election in July, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
announced some major changes in the program.
   The changes are subject to approval by the 270-member
Parliament, or Majlis. Debate on the changes began in the Majlis
Wednesday.
   The Majlis is dominated by hardliners who oppose Rafsanjani's
pragmatic policies and his ambitious economic plans.

   Stock prices were most lower in moderate
afternoon trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 6.83 points to
2,734.85 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was down 3.41
points at noon.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by a 7 to 6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 756 issues down, 644 up and 538

   Big Board volume came to 106.45 million shares.
   Analysts said banking and technology stocks highlighted selling
activity.
   The government reported today that the nation's commercial banks
lost $744 million in the third quarter this year, due partly to
rising real estate loan problems.
   IBM led technology stocks lower after gains in the previous two
sessions. IBM stock rose Tuesday after the company announced a
major restructuring but traders said investors were selling the
stock amid uncertainty about the impact of the changes.
   Analysts also attributed the market's sluggishness to investor
caution ahead of Friday's unemployment report. Data suggesting a
further slowdown in economic growth likely would be positive for
the market, analysts said, because it would raise expectations that
the Federal Reserve would continue easing interest rates.
   ``There's a lack of direction. People don't know what to do,''
said Hildegarde Zagorski, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. ``They're sitting around waiting for Friday's report.''
   The market generally ignored a government report on
third-quarter productivity and the Fed's ``beige book'' summary of
economic conditions, dealers said.
   The Labor Department reported that productivity in the non-farm
sector of the economy improved at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in
the third quarter while hours worked grew at a slower 1.3 percent,
a sign of slackening demand for goods.
   The Fed report said the nation's economy was ``stable to
modestly expanding.''

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of investors rushed to beat
the Wednesday deadline for applying to buy shares in Britain's
water industry under the government's $8.2 billion privatization of
the business.
   There had been concern the sale would attract little interest
because of the British stock market's recent sluggishness. The
privatization also has been strongly opposed by critics who say
such a vital utility should remain in state hands for security
reasons and to protect consumers from rate hikes.
   But a line stretched for some 250 yards outside National
Westminster Bank in the City of London financial district as the 10
a.m. deadline approached.
   Geoff Taylor, privatization manager for Natwest, said the bank
had handled previous sell-offs of government industries and ``I
don't think we have ever had a queue as long as this.''
   Environment Minister Michael Howard said, ``It is a
reaffirmation of popular capitalism, and I am very pleased with
that. It is obviously a very enthusiastic response.''
   Some investors said their desire for profit outweighed any
opposition they had to the sell-off. On the unofficial ``gray''
market, the share price is trading at a 27 percent premium to the
government's offering price.
   ``I am not politically in favor of privatizing water, but if
it's going to happen I may as well have a bit of it,'' said
electrician Edward Sutton, who applied for 2,500 shares.
   The government has structured the 140 pence-a-share sale so that
investors put down 100 pence _ the equivalent of about $1.57 _ a
share and pay the rest in installments spanning 20 months.
   Schroders PLC, the investment firm advising the government in
its latest privatization, said the sale of the 10 English and Welsh
water authorities was ``well-subscribed.''
   The offer is expected to be oversubscribed, but Schroders said
exact information on the demand would not be available until later
in the week, because hundreds of thousands of application forms
were handed in at the last minute.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold off billions of dollars worth of state-owned companies in the
past decade.
   The government also is planning to sell Britain's electricity
industry by mid-1992, in what could be the biggest sale yet at an
estimated $31 billion.
   Most sales, of such companies as Jaguar PLC and British Airways
PLC, have been successful. However, the government's sale of its
remaining one-third stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC flopped
because it coincided with the October 1987 stock market crash.
   When the government announced the price of the 2.183 million
water shares last month, critics said the shares were priced too
cheaply to attract buyers.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in
active trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders
reacted to prospects of increased export activity.
   Wheat led the way in the rally, with buying spurred by news that
the U.S. Department of Agriculture has targeted China for 1 million
metric tons of wheat under the department's Export Enhancement
Program.
   Under EEP, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas
markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or
other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   ``There is speculation that the Soviet Union will be next'' to
benefit from the program, said analyst Ted Mao of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are trying to hammer out a new
long-term grain pact. The current grain pact will expire next year.
   Corn futures were higher due to speculative demand resulting
from the strong surge in wheat prices, Mao said.
   The same held true for soybeans, which also drew support from
slow farmer selling and reports of barge delays on the Mississippi
River.
   Analysts said prices were held back by a lack of export
business, and news that Argentine farmers are enjoying adequate
soil moisture and are moving ahead with soybean planting.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.08{ a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 2 cents higher with December at $2.35{ a bushel; oats were
} cents to 1\ cents lower with December at $1.43{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2} cents to 6\ cents higher with January at $5.79{ a

   Harrods, the huge London store, will

   The agreement with Harrods, along with a ``Voyage to 1939''

attract visitors to the ship and the next-door Spruce Goose, Howard
Hughes' huge old ``flying boat.''
   The Harrods outlet will be 900 square feet, less than 1 percent
the size of the department store in London's Knightsbridge section.
   Walt Disney Co. manages the Queen Mary and the Spruce Goose for

<HEAD>Saatchi Posts Big Loss For Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC, the world's largest
advertising and marketing services company, reported Wednesday it
lost 58.5 million pounds, or $92 million, for its fiscal year, due
to high costs and troubles with its consulting business.
   While the loss was larger than many analysts had expected, they
said that it resulted largely from management decisions to take
some unusual writedowns.
   The loss for the 12 months ended Sept. 30 contrasted with a net
profit of 75.1 million pounds, which is about $118 million, or 44.5
pence a share, in the previous year.
   Revenue totalled 973.5 million pounds, or $1.5 billion, up 13
percent from 862.2 million pounds a year earlier.
   Saatchi said its pre-tax profits sank 48 percent to 61.3 million
pounds, or $96 million, from 117 million pounds, or $184 million, a
year earlier.
   The company reported unusual costs of 39.5 million pounds, or
$62 million, to cover potential rental costs of surplus office
space and the cost of a reorganization and redundancies in the
communications division, which includes advertising agencies.
   It also had an extraordinary cost of 22 million pounds, or $35
million, arising from its consulting business.
   Communication revenue rose 7.6 percent to 725 million pounds, or
$1.1 billion, while consulting revenue rose 32 percent to 248.5
million pounds, or $390 million.
   ``The major problem this year has been costs rather than
revenues,'' Saatchi said.
   Saatchi has embarked on a number of changes in recent months,
refocusing its business strategy away from consulting and adding
several senior personnel. In October, Robert Louis-Dreyfus was
appointed chief executive of the group.
   Emma Hill, who follows the advertising agency business for
Wertheim &amp; Co. in New York, said, ``The significance of this report
is that the new CEO seems to be cleaning house and forcing a hard
look at the business.''
   The company reportedly is having difficulty in getting the price
it wants for its consulting businesses, which it bought for about
250 million pounds, or $393 million. Saatchi hopes to raise up to
350 million pounds, or about $550 million, from the sales. It has
already sold three consulting businesses _ Gamma, MDK and Cleveland
Consulting Associates _ for $25 million.
   It said in Wednesday's earnings announcement that it has also
agreed to sell its interest in Information Consulting Group to
McKinsey &amp; Co. for $12 million.
   James Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities USA
in New York, said Saatchi had invested about $30 million in that
operation, which was created about a year ago by a group that
included some top-ranking executives from Arthur Andersen and other
accounting firms.
   He said the operation had been a drain on Saatchi's earnings.
   Saatchi noted that its remaining consulting operations ``have
strong brand names'' and said it ``is not prepared to give up these
valuable assets for less than their market value.''
   The company didn't break out quarterly or half-year results. It
isn't required to under British law.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's largest bank announced Wednesday
it plans to open a branch in Buffalo to serve companies taking
advantage of the new U.S.-Canada free trade agreement.
   The Royal Bank of Canada would become the first Canadian bank
with a branch in Buffalo, and James M. Walker, general manager of
its U.S. operations, said it would be the first Canadian bank
branch anywhere in the United States aimed specifically at taking
advantage of the free trade pact.
   Buffalo, astride the main routes between Canada's industrial
heartland near Toronto and the eastern United States, was the
obvious place to locate such a venture, Walker said at a news
conference.
   ``It is a natural gateway for business interests on both sides
of the border,'' he said. ``And clearly, it is a pivotal point for
the largest volume of two-way trade between any two trading
partners anywhere in the world.''
   The Royal Bank of Canada, with assets of about $97 billion in
U.S. dollars, is the largest bank in Canada and the fifth largest
in North America. Its nine existing U.S. offices serve primarily
large multinational companies, but the new branch will focus on
smaller firms as well, Walker said.
   The new branch is expected to open in February after receiving
approval from the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, he said.
   The bank will provide corporate clients with loans, currency
exchange, letters of credit, help with international mergers and
acquisitions and advice on exploiting Canadian markets, Walker
said. He said there are no plans to expand into retail banking.

   The federal government should promote the
study of foreign languages and countries by establishing an agency
to address American shortcomings in the field, 165 business and
teaching groups said Wednesday.
   The groups, organized as the Coalition for the Advancement of
Languages and International Studies, said the United States is the
only major power that does not require its diplomats to know a
foreign language.
   The United States also is among a few countries in which a
student can graduate from college without studying a foreign
language, the coalition said.
   Davydd Greenwood, who heads the Center for International Studies
at Cornell University, said 40 percent of 99 U.S. companies he
surveyed believed a lack of competence in foreign languages had
hurt profitability. Two-thirds foresaw the need of more competence
to succeed in the future.
   The coalition also called for:
   _More U.S. government support for international exchanges of
students and professionals.
   _New language requirements and performance standards to be set
by state and local authorities, which have the major voice in U.S.
education.
   _Collaboration between business and schools on increasing
Americans' knowledge of the rest of the world.
   Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
said many universities have dropped language requirements over the
past 20 years.
   Stanley N. Katz, president of the American Council of Learned
Societies, said he drafted a bill for the Congress suggesting a
choice between a government-funded ``National Endowment for
International Education and Competence'' and a private corporation
with a government charter.

   Stock prices ended lower in listless trading
today as investors remained cautious ahead of the government's
unemployment report.
   ``There's a lack of direction. People don't know what to do,''
said Hildegarde Zagorski, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. ``They're sitting around waiting for Friday's report.''
   Data suggesting a further slowdown in economic growth likely
would be positive for the market, analysts said, because it would
raise expectations that the Federal Reserve would continue easing
interest rates.
   A government report on third-quarter productivity and the Fed's
``beige book'' summary of economic conditions, was generally
neutral for the stock market, dealers said.
   The Labor Department reported that productivity in the non-farm
sector of the economy improved at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in
the third quarter while hours worked grew at a slower 1.3 percent,
a sign of slackening demand for goods.
   However, the bond market, which had been stagnant in recent
sessions, reacted negatively to the Fed report, which said the
nation's economy was ``stable to modestly expanding.'' Dealers said
weakness in the credit market helped weaken stock prices after
midday.
   Banking stocks highlighted selling activity after the government
reported that the nation's commercial banks lost $744 million in
the third quarter due partly to rising real estate loan problems.
   Weakness in IBM stock led technology issues lower after gains in
the previous two sessions. Dealers said investors were selling the
stock amid uncertainty about the impact of a massive restructuring
announced Tuesday.

   A sharp spike upward in heating oil prices
helped carry energy futures higher on Wednesday.
   The contract for January delivery of wholesale No.2 heating oil,
which had been down as much as .70 cent in early trading, rose .41
cent to close at 64.46 cents per gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Other contract months posted even larger gains, continuing the
week's upward trend. The January heating oil contract gained 0.26
cent on Tuesday.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which gained 0.32
cent on Tuesday, climbed another .33 cent to finish at 53.17 cents.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade
of U.S. crude oil, rose 13 cents to close at $20.47 per 42-gallon
barrel. The contract had gained 9 cents on Tuesday. Longer-term
contracts posted slightly smaller gains.
   Chris McCormack, a vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., noted that heating oil ``continued to be a driving factor
behind higher prices.'' Unseasonably cold weather in many parts of
the country has increased the demand for fuel.
   McCormack noted, however, the December typically is a weak month
for heating oil contracts. Buying begins in November in
anticipation of cold weather but usually abates until winter really
sets in, usually in January, he said.
   McCormack also said bullishness in the European energy market
spilled over into U.S. trading and helped feed the optimism over
higher prices.

   The dollar declined against most major foreign
currencies in worldwide trading Wednesday as dealers kept their
buying interest focused on West German marks.
   Gold prices edged slightly higher in the United States after
turning in a mixed performance overseas.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
ended at $404.90 a troy ounce, up $1.40 from late Tuesday. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at
$404.60 as of 4 p.m. EST, up $1.10 from Tuesday's late bid.
   Currency dealers received an incentive to sell dollars from
reports that a U.S. Treasury official said the dollar's recent
decline against the mark was not alarming, said Thomas Palladino,
an assistant vice president in the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's New
York office.
   The remark attributed to David Mulford, Treasury undersecretary,
was interpreted to mean the U.S. government would not intervene
aggressively in foreign exchange markets to stem the dollar's slide
against the mark.
   ``It seems everybody is looking for a lower dollar,'' Palladino
said. ``It's more of a mark-driven market than a dollar-driven
market.''
   Some dealers said the strength of the West German economy
justified the rise in the mark's value.
   Demand for marks has surged as the borders between East and West
Germany have crumbled. The assumption is that liberalizations in
East Germany and elsewhere in Eastern Europe could make the West
German economy boom, possibly leading to higher interest rates in
that country.
   Higher West German interest rates would tend to increase returns
on mark-denominated investments.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising to a close
of 143.75 Japanese yen from 143.68 yen on Tuesday. In London late
Wednesday, the dollar traded at 143.85 yen. Later in New York, the
dollar was quoted at 144.025 yen, up from 143.70 yen late Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5765 late Wednesday from
Tuesday's $1.5715. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.5765
from $1.5700.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.7660 West German marks, down from
1.7775; 1.5890 Swiss francs, down from 1.5915; 6.0325 French
francs, down from 6.0670; 1,303.25 Italian lire, down from
1,309.00; and 1.16115 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1630.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Tuesday's late
rates included: 1.7648 West German marks, down from 1.7790; 1.5875
Swiss francs, down from 1.5910; 6.0315 French francs, down from
6.0675; 2.0010 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0100; 1,301.15 Italian
lire, down from 1,307.00; and 1.1602 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1640.
   Precious metals prices were mixed and gold lost ground on
several world markets as dealers sold to collect profits amassed
during the recent surge in gold prices.
   Gold bullion prices dropped in London, the major market, but
were higher in Zurich, ranging between $400 and $405 a troy ounce.
Gold closed in London at a bid of $402.25 a troy ounce, down from
$404. The closing price in Zurich was $403.75, up from $403.50.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $400.95 an ounce,
down from $402.95.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.56 a troy
ounce, down from $5.60. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery closed at $5.555 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.533.

<HEAD>Expectations of Increased Exports Send Grains, Soybeans Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in active trading
Wednesday as traders reacted to prospects of increased export
activity.
   In other markets, sugar prices surged, energy futures were
higher, precious metals were firm, and livestock and pork futures
were mixed.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.08{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2\
cents higher with December at $2.36 a bushel; oats were } cents to
1\ cents lower with December at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were 2\
cents to 5} cents higher with January at $5.79\ a bushel.
   Wheat led the rally on the Chicago Board of Trade, with buying
spurred by news that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has
targeted China for 1 million metric tons of wheat under the
department's Export Enhancement Program.
   Under EEP, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities at
reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas
markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or
other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   ``There is speculation that the Soviet Union will be next'' to
benefit from the program, said analyst Ted Mao of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are trying to hammer out a new
long-term grain pact. The current grain pact will expire next year.
   Corn futures were higher due to speculative demand resulting
from the strong surge in wheat prices, Mao said.
   The same held true for soybeans, which also drew support from
slow farmer selling and reports of barge delays on the Mississippi
River.
   Analysts said prices were held back by a lack of export
business, and news that Argentine farmers are enjoying adequate
soil moisture and are moving ahead with soybean planting.
   Sugar futures climbed dramatically on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange as traders reacted to news that a Brazilian judge
has banned the import of methanol to alleviate a shortage in fuel
alcohol.
   The ban could divert sugar cane earmarked for export to the
domestic fuel-alcohol industry, analysts said.
   Brazil's 4 million automobiles operate on a mixture of methanol,
ethanol _ sugar-based alcohol _ and gasoline.
   Brazil is committed to export about 640,000 metric tons of
sugar, and by importing methanol, sugar cane was freed for foreign
markets. That could now change, analysts said.
   Sugar was .31 cent to .77 cent higher with January at 14 cents a
pound.
   Gold and silver futures were higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar eased against foreign currencies.
   Underpinning precious metals is the belief interest rates are
easing and the unstable situation in eastern Europe remains
unstable, said analyst Betty Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   She noted that the December gold contract, which will cease
trading on Dec. 27, held above the $400-an-ounce mark, an
indication of market strength.
   Gold was $1.20 to $1.40 higher with December at $404.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.2. cents higher with December at
$5.555 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helped
along by the strength in heating oil prices.
   Chris McCormack, a vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said unseasonably cold weather in many parts of the country
has increased the demand for fuel.
   McCormack also said bullishness in the European energy market
spilled over into U.S. trading and helped feed the optimism over
higher prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 10 cents to 13 cents
higher with January at $20.47 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent to
.57 cent higher with January at 64.46 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .33 cent to .57 cent higher with January at 53.17
cents a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Live cattle were .18 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December
at 75.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .10
cent higher with January at 82.92 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with December at 51.32 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .33 cent lower to 1.20 cents higher with
February at 56.45 cents a pound.

   Stock prices fell in listless trading Wednesday,
reflecting investor caution ahead of the government's unemployment
report later this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slid 4.91 points to
finish at 2,736.77, the first time since early November that it has
fallen in two consecutive sessions.
   Declining issues narrowly outpaced advancers in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 767 issues
down, 714 up and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.85 million
shares, down from 154.64 million in the previous session.
   The market struggled through a lackluster session with banking
and technology stocks taking the brunt of the selling activity.
   Wall Street analysts attributed the market's sluggishness to
investor caution ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected
to provide a clearer picture about the outlook for interest rates.
   ``We still haven't gotten off the dime with regard to what we're
doing and where we're going. Interest rates remain a mystery and
what the Fed is going to do,'' said Thomas Walsh, head of equity
trading for Nikko Securities International.
   ``People are sitting here waiting for canned book numbers and
employment numbers. Each day it's a new excuse not to invest,'' he
said.
   If the data points to slower employment growth, it would confirm
mounting evidence of a slowdown in economic growth. That would
raise prospects the Federal Reserve would continue easing interest
rates to stimulate growth, which would help corporate earnings,
analysts said.
   A government report on third-quarter productivity and the
Federal Reserve's ``Beige Book'' summary of economic conditions was
generally neutral for the market.
   The Labor Department reported productivity in the non-farm
sector of the economy improved at an annual rate of 2.5 percent,
while hours worked grew at a slower 1.3 percent, a sign of
slackening demand for goods.
   However, the bond market, which had been stagnant in recent
sessions, reacted negatively to the Fed report, which said the
nation's economy was generally ``stable to modestly expanding.''
Traders said weakness in the credit market helped depress stock
prices.
   Despite the caution, most analysts said the stock market showed
signs it is working its way into a yearend rally.
   ``The averages are moving up relieving the oversold conditions
that developed in October,'' said Richard McCabe, manager of market
analysis for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 176.42 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market slipped $4.164 billion, or 0.12
percent, in value from Tuesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
declined 0.37 to 192.82.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, IBM lost 1 to 98| as
investors sold stock amid uncertainty about the impact of a massive
restructuring announced Tuesday, dealers said.
   Banking stocks also weakened after a government report that
showed the nation's commercial banks lost $744 million in the third
quarter due partly to rising real estate loan problems. First
Interstate Bancorp, the most active NYSE stock, fell 1\ to 52,
BankAmerica lost 1] to 26 and NCNB declined 2{ to 42].
   McGraw Hill, not among the most actives, declined 2 to 61{ after
the company announced a restructuring that involves eliminating
1,000 jobs and taking fourth-quarter pretax charges of $220 million.
   Chevron, meanwhile, gained 1\ to 72, Deere &amp; Co. advanced | to
57{ and AT&amp;T was unchanged at 43|.
   Among broader averages, Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell
1.00 to 398.71, and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 1.03 to
348.55.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market went
down 1.88 to 456.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 375.83, up 0.95.

   Publishing and information services giant
McGraw-Hill Inc. said Wednesday it was eliminating more than 1,000
jobs, or 7 percent of its fulltime positions, and taking a big
charge in a restructuring to cut costs.
   The company said it would take one-time pretax charges of $220
million, or $152 million after taxes, in the fourth quarter for
writing down the value of assets, closing its General Books unit
and setting up a reserve for employee severance payments.
   Analysts said the job cuts were overdue and that the writedowns
fit a pattern of recent refiguring of asset values in the
publishing business.
   But investors sent McGraw-Hill's stock down following the
announcement, in apparent disappointment at the company's
projection of earnings for 1990 despite the charges being taken
this year.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, McGraw-Hill closed down $2 a
share at $61.50.
   The company did not specify where the job eliminations would be,
but indicated many would be corporate positions rather than in
operating units, which include Business Week magazine and Standard
&amp; Poor's debt rating service.
   ``The effort to improve productivity and make the organization
leaner is a step in the right direction,'' said Peter Appert, media
analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. But he said the
company should do more.
   ``Operating margins in some of their units are low by industry
standards,'' Appert said, citing TV station operations and some
information services units.
   He said the stock market's negative reaction to the announcement
would do nothing to improve the company's position as a frequent
subject of takeover speculation.
   Bruce Thorp, media analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, called the announcement ``one of the more decisive
things'' McGraw-Hill has done. ``They have done a lot of fiddling
with operations in the past,'' he said.
   But he said Chairman Joseph L. Dionne's statement that next
year's earnings excluding non-recurring gains would be within a
range of $3.50 to $4 a share surprised analysts who follow
publishing companies.
   ``It's a sign that business isn't really good,'' he said,
referring to McGraw-Hill and the overall industry.
   ``The outlook was a lot worse than anybody expected,'' said Bert
Boksen, who follows McGraw-Hill for Raymond James &amp; Asscoaites in
St. Petersburg, Fla. ``It indicates a softer than expected outlook
for the school publishing business and a general slowing of the
economy.''
   Several publishing companeies recently have taken writedowns,
including Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. and Paramount
Communications Inc.,which owns Simon &amp; Schuster. Time Warner Inc.
recently agreed to sell its Scott Foresman &amp; Co. for less than it
paid for the unit three years ago and expects to take a pretax
charge of $175 million on the deal.
   McGraw-Hill said the charges include a $145 million asset
writedown, including the shutdown of General Books and writedowns
at the Data Resources economic forecasting unit. The company
declined to provide figures on the size of the book unit, which
sells general interest books.
   It also said it would establish a $75 million reserve for
severance payments connected with the staff cuts.
   The company said it planned to scrap its current internal
structure of three operating companies _ publishing, financial
services and information services _ and have all operations report
to one of two new corporate executive vice presidents reporting to
Dionne.
   One new executive vice president is Harold W. McGraw III,
great-grandson of the company's founder and now in charge of
overseeing the financial services, Business Week, broadcasting,
aerospace and defense groups. He had been head of financial
services.
   The other, Walter D. Serwatka, will be responsible for the
construction, education, professional publishing, legal and
computers and communications groups. He had headed information
services.
   ``Adopting this streamlined corporate structure eliminates an
entire layer of staffing and related expenses associated with the
three operating companies,'' Dionne said in a statement.
   The rest of the jobs being eliminated will result from the
previously-disclosed plans to automate delivery of the F.W. Dodge
Group reports on the construction industry and from corporate staff
reductions, spokesman Stewart Trisler said.
   McGraw-Hill currently employs about 13,700 people, meaning the
reductions would amount to a 7 percent cut in staffing.
   The company earned $54.97 million, or $1.13 a share, on revenue
of $507.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1988. It earned $185.5
million, or $3.83 a share, on revenue of $1.82 billion for all of
1988.

<TEXT>
   The nation's unprecedented peacetime economic
expansion, now in its eighth year, will last at least three more
years, the nation's top business economists said Wednesday.
   At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board reported current
economic activity ranging from stable to expanding modestly.
Consumer spending varies around the country, it said, but prices
range from flat to increasing modestly.
   The National Association of Business Economists said the latest
survey of its members found 62 percent expecting no recession for
the next three years.
   That expectation is ``a sea change,'' according to James F.
Smith, the organization's president and financial professor at the
University of North Carolina.
   Commenting that economists rarely agree on anything, Smith said,
``We never, ever had not just a majority, but an overwhelming
majority, forecasting growth over three years.''
   But nearly 20 percent of the 59 business economists surveyed
said they felt a recession could occur before next April.
   The economy has slowed considerably since the Federal Reserve
began boosting interest rates to restrain rising prices. As
inflationary pressures moderated, however, the central bank has
gradually let rates fall.
   The Fed, in its latest survey of the economy, said that the
Federal Reserve districts that reported on prices generally noted
flat to modest increases, ``with several mentioning the continuing
escalation of medical insurance costs.''
   Most of its districts ``describe economic activity as stable to
modestly expanding. ... Consumer spending has varied'' and
``strength has been mostly confined to nondurable items, while
sales of autos and other durables have generally been weak.''
   The central bank said that most districts reported softening in
manufacturing and that while construction is strong or improving in
the West and Midwest, it is sluggish elsewhere. Agriculture has
improved in much of the country, it said.
   The survey by the 12 district banks is compiled by the Fed every
six weeks to prepare for meetings of the Federal Open Market
Committee, the bank's monetary policy-setting arm. The material was
gathered prior to Nov. 28. The committee is scheduled to meet Dec.
18.
   A senior Fed official, speaking to reporters after the survey
was released, said that while the automobile and housing industries
were weak, he believed the overall economy would be kept out of a
recession by strength in other areas.
   The Fed official, who spoke on the condition that his name not
be used, said continued growth in U.S. exports and strength in
sales of consumer goods other than autos should be enough to keep
the economy moving forward in the coming year.
   Asked whether the Fed should ease interest rates further to
fight weakness in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as autos and
housing, the Fed official said, ``I think we need further evidence
from those sectors to see whether they were responding to our past
actions'' before making any further moves to ease credit.
   The business economists' forecast was considerably more
optimistic than recent surves by the organization. Last May, for
instance, 63 percent of the economists said they expected a
recession next year. Three months later, 37 percent still forecast
a recession in 1990.
   But the economists predicted that the gross national product _
the nation's total output of goods and services _ will continue to
grow slowly, dropping from the 2.9 percent forecast for 1989 to 1.8
percent next year.
   Smith said that since 1983, the economists have been within one
percentage point of forecasting the following year's gross national
product.
   At the same time, the economists predicted further easing of
both inflation and interest rates. They said the consumer price
index will fall from the 4.8 percent forecast for 1989 to 4.2
percent next year.
   But their report said that ``the slower overall growth and
weaker industrial production is not expected to be reflected in
higher unemployment.'' It said unemployment would rise only from
5.3 percent this year to 5.5 percent next year.
   While they forecast improvements in the housing industry, they
saw no relief for the automobile industry next year. Both
industries have been adversely affected by the Fed's interest rate
policies.
   And the forecasters predicted the nation's twin deficits in
merchandise trade and the federal budget would narrow, but ``only
very slowly.''
   ``For 1990, the trade imbalance should be about $100 billion,''
which would be down from $109 billion in 1989, ``and federal
spending will exceed revenue by $141 billion'' after a reported
$152 billion deficit in fiscal 1989, they said.

   Allegheny International Inc. said Wednesday a
federal judge has approved a $6.25 million settlement of
shareholders' lawsuits from 1986 that accused some officers and
directors of violating securities laws.
   The settlement of derivative and class-action lawsuits will be
funded by the officers and directors' liability insurance of
Allegheny International. The Pittsburgh-based small appliance
manufacturer will not be required to spend any of its own money to
satisfy claims.
   Under terms of the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge
Gustave Diamond, the company will receive $1 million. Decatur
Income Fund Inc. will receive $337,428 to settle its claim, and all
legal expenses and legal fees will be deducted from the gross
amount.
   The rest of the fund will be divided among investors who bought
Allegheny International common stock, preferred stock and
subordinated debentures between Aug. 1, 1985, and April 18, 1986.
   Class members are eligible to receive compensation if they have
not excluded themselves from the class and file timely proofs of
claims.
   Unsecured creditors, meanwhile, have filed a competing
reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the financially
troubled company.
   The plan marks the first time any group other than the company
has filed a reorganization plan since Allegheny International lost
its exclusive right to do so in June.
   Allegheny International has operated under Chapter 11 of U.S.
bankruptcy laws for almost two years. During that time, the company
proposed nine reorganization plans, the latest of which was
submitted last week.
   The proposal does not specify whether assets should be sold,
although the unsecured creditors previously have called for the
sale of the company's flagship Oster-Sunbeam small appliance unit.
   Like the company's most recent proposal, the creditors' plan
would repay most of Allegheny International's $740 million in debts
with new stock. Its plan would issue virtually no cash to anyone
other than trade creditors, however, while the company's plan would
distribute $200 million in cash, most of it to bank lenders.
   Those lenders would get only notes and stock under the unsecured
creditors' proposal.
   Unsecured creditors would become the company's majority
stockholders and gain the right to name most directors. Most
creditors would get between 48 and 75.5 shares of common stock in
the reorganized company for each $1,000 they are owed.
   Current shareholders would get only 1.5 percent of the
reorganized company's shares, the same as envisioned in the
company's plan.

<HEAD>Shell Announces $1.1 Billion Oil Development in Gulf of Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. unveiled a plan Wednesday to build
the deepest-water oil and natural gas production platform in the
world at a cost of about $1.1 billion.
   The company said it was soliciting bids to build and install a
tension leg platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2,860 feet of water,
which is more than half a mile deep. Shell said it would be a world
water-depth record.
   The tension leg platform, which employs a relatively new type of
technology, will be in the Gulf about 255 miles southeast of
Houston.
   Last month, a tension leg platform built by Conoco Inc. in the
Gulf in 1,760 feet of water was declared operational. It is the
world's deepest oil and natural gas production platform in
operation.
   Houston-based Shell, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch
Shell in The Netherlands, said the cost of the ``Auger'' project,
estimated at $1.1 billion, will include fabrication and
installation of the platform, development drilling, complete
production facilities and pipelines.
   ``The Auger TLP (tension leg platform) represents another giant
step toward narrowing the gap between the industry's ability to
explore and its ability to produce,'' said Frank H. Richardson,
president of Shell Oil. ``This project exemplifies Shell's
continuing commitment to develop the technology necessary to
produce our nation's frontier oil and gas reserves.''
   Shell said the platform will be the first Gulf of Mexico tension
leg platform to support a drilling rig and complete production
facilities.
   Initial development will begin about mid-1990, and the drilling
rig and production facilities will be installed in 1993. The rig
will have 32 well slots.
   The facility will be able to drill 15,000 to 20,000 feet
sub-sea, Shell officials said.
   Production is expected to begin in 1993 and will increase to a
projected peak rate of 40,000 barrels of oil per day in 1995, and
150 million cubic feet of gas per day in the year 2001.
   A tension platform rig floats at the surface of the water and is
connected to a foundation template on the sea floor by tubular
steel tendons. The buoyancy of the platform creates an upward force
that puts the tendons in tension, eliminating vertical motion and
holding the platform in place.

<HEAD>Federal Officials Broaden Probe of S&amp;L Owner Dixon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have broadened their
investigation into the dealings of former Vernon Savings and Loan
Association owner Don D. Dixon, his attorney said Wednesday, the
same day the last of seven former officers of the thrift was
convicted of soliciting kickbacks.
   Attorney William M. Ravkind said he received a second letter
Wednesday notifying him Dixon is the target of a federal
investigation.
   Ravkind would not say what areas the Dallas Bank Fraud Task
Force was investigating, nor what a previous target letter had
outlined. Prosecutors would not comment on the investigation.
   Ravkind said he expected Dixon eventually would be indicted. ``I
don't have any way of knowing where this investigation is headed,
(but) I don't think they'll bring anything until they've completed
the entire investigation,'' he said.
   Dixon currently faces no criminal charges, although he is the
lead defendant in a $540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in
1987. Ravkind said that suit is on hold pending the outcome of any
criminal investigation.
   Earlier Wednesday, former Vernon Chairman Woody F. Lemons was
convicted of soliciting $221,000 in kickbacks from Vernon
transactions in 1985 and 1986.
   Lemons is the seventh, and highest ranking, former Vernon
official either to plead guilty to or be convicted of crimes
stemming from their actions at the thrift, which was seized by
federal regulators in 1987 in a then-record bailout.
   Lemons' conviction wraps all current outstanding cases connected
to Vernon, which frequently is cited as an example of some of the
industry's worst abuses.
   He was convicted on 13 charges accusing him of soliciting a
$9,000 kickback from a Plano loan broker in 1985 and receiving
$212,000 from the broker in 1986.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Maloney set sentencing for Jan.
18. Lemons, who remained free on bond, could be sentenced to up to
65 years in jail and fined as much as $500,000.
   Prosecutor Robert Hauberg said the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force
is continuing to investigate Vernon and other thrifts for possible
charges.

<HEAD>Sears' Entrance In Travel Industry Stirs Mixed Emotions Among Competitors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. plans to offer vacation
packages next year to its retail customers, a step that has caused
mixed reaction among travel industry professionals.
   Sears plans to test-market the vacation packages next fall with
a mailing to its charge-card customers in a few major metropolitan
areas yet to be selected, Sears spokeswoman Kathy Gucfa said
Wednesday.
   The packages would likely include air and hotel accommodations
to about 20 destinations including Walt Disney World in Orlando,
Fla., the Caribbean and Mexico, Miss Gucfa said.
   ``We are constantly on the alert to meet the needs of our
customers,'' said Mary Jean Houde, another Sears spokeswoman. ``We
consider travel a growth industry.''
   Voit Gilmore, president of the American Society of Travel
Agents, said that Sears might stimulate business for its
competitors by popularizing certain destinations and boosting
overall demand.
   Travel agents aren't likely to view Sears as a big threat,
Gilmore said. ``The travel market has so much growth potential that
the entry of Sears would not frighten a good professional travel
agent anywhere,'' he said.
   Others said they weren't sure Sears knows the territory.
   ``Personal service is the thing,'' said Cliff Johnson, Midwest
chapter president of ASTA. ``You've got to know the product.''
   ``In an free enterprise service we welcome anyone to come in,
but you can't sell a $3,000 travel product like a pair of shoes or
jeans,'' said Johnson, who is also the president of Johnson Travel
Service, in Oak Park, Ill.
   Joanne Del Debbio, Chicago-area manager of Horizon Travel &amp;
Tours Inc., was blunt in her assessment.
   ``Sears should stick to dry goods...and let travel agents sell
travel,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The cost of living rose 6.5
percent in November, indicating inflation is heating up at a time
the government had promised it would be stamped out.
   The monthly hike was the second-lowest this year, but it was
higher than the 5.6 percent tallied in October, reversing a trend
that had been downward since July.
   President Carlos Menem, who took office on July 8, pledged that
a 54 percent devaluation and massive hikes in public service rates
he implemented on July 9 would result in inflation of only 2
percent in December.
   The cost of living so far this year has soared by 3,486 percent,
including a hyperinflationary 197 percent in July. For the 12-month
period through November, it rose by 3,731 percent.
   With Argentina's currency, the austral, trading on the black
market at about 33 percent below its official value, newspapers in
the capital Buenos Aires speculated Wednesday that another
devaluation was imminent.
   The government has denied it is considering a devaluation.

<HEAD>Buffett Strikes Again, Buying Stock in Paper Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL ARABAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warren E. Buffett extended his
stock-picking prowess to Champion International Corp. on Wednesday
as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought 300,000 shares of preferred
stock for $300 million.
   Berkshire bought a new series of convertible stock that gives
the Omaha, Neb.-based company about 8 percent of shareholders'
voting rights in Champion, a paper products company with $5.1
billion in sales last year.
   Berkshire will have voting rights with the preferred stock
``because that's how it's negotiated,'' said Champion spokesman
Robert W. Turner.
   ``We are delighted to place this issue with a long-term investor
who has such an outstanding reputation,'' said Andrew C. Sigler,
Champion's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Buffett is famous for buying stock in companies that turn out to
be good long-term investments. His picks include Salomon Brothers
Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Gillette Co. and Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   ``The big thing about Buffett is he's in for the long term,''
Turner said, ``and that has been what our chairman, Andy Sigler,
has been saying for years and years _ that to be competitive
worldwide you must make capital investments over the long term.''
   Stamford-based Champion makes paper primarily for copiers,
magazines, catalogs and newspapers. The company owns 6.4 million
acres of timberland in the U.S. and also makes plywood and lumber.
   It is a leader in an industry that has enjoyed record profits in
the last few years. But some analysts have predicted a 6-month to
two-year downturn in the industry because of overcapacity and a
corresponding drop in prices.
   For the three quarters ended Sept. 30, Champion had net income
of $329.4 million on sales of $3.896 billion, down from a profit of
$336.5 million on sales of $3.814 billion in the first three
quarters of 1988.
   Berkshire had a profit of $285.7 million on sales of $2 billion
last year.
   Champion issued the shares at $1,000 each, with each share
guaranteed a dividend of 9.25 percent, or $92.50 per year, Turner
said.
   The stock is convertible to common stock, which can reap higher
profits but is riskier because it is not guaranteed a dividend.
   ``The board of directors has the authority from time to time to
issue preference stock, as opposed to common stock,'' Turner said.
``We have not done that very much but it's being done on a
series-by-series basis.''
   He said each preferred share carries about 26.3 votes, or a
total 7.5 million votes, on all issues submitted to shareholders.
That gives Berkshire about 8 percent of the voting rights, based on
91 million to 92 million shares of outstanding common stock.
   Berkshire agreed to limit its ownership in Champion to 18
percent for the next 10 years unless Champion's board approves an
increase. Berkshire also agreed to certain restrictions on
reselling the shares.

<HEAD>Employee Buyout Plan Presented to Flight Attendants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of UAL Corp. presented their revised
proposal for an employee buyout of the parent of United Airlines to
leaders of the Association of Flight Attendants on Wednesday,
officials said.
   The presentation of the new buyout offer came at what was to be
the opening session of a new round of contract negotiations between
flight attendants and United.
   United's flight attendants have been working without a contract
for two years. The airline's management has been seeking salary and
work rule consessions from the attendants, union officials said.
   Patricia Friend, outgoing president of United's flight
attendants union, refused to comment on Wednesday's talks, only to
confirm that a revised employee buyout plan had been presented.
   Joe Hopkins, a UAL spokesman, also refused to comment on the
talks.
   Analysts believe the management buyout plan will value the
company at $210 to $240 a share, or a total of $4.75 billion to
$5.42 billion.
   It is believed officials of the Chicago-based company are
seeking ironclad commitments from lenders and the company's three
major unions before publicly announcing any buyout offer.
   The previous buyout effort, led by United's management, pilots
and British Airways PLC, failed in October when lenders refused to
finance it.
   The lenders cited the strong opposition of the Machinists union,
which represents about 25,000 of UAL's 70,000 employees.
   Officials of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots
Association and the Machinists union have refused to comment on the
latest buyout proposal.
   Meanwhile, the New York investment group Coniston Partners has
threatened to oust 13 of UAL's 15 directors and create a
five-member board dominated by the group if the current board fails
to sell or restructure UAL.
   This week Coniston announced it had increased its stake in the
company to 11.8 percent, up from 9.7 percent. UAL stock closed
Wednesday at $176.50 a share, down $5.75, in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.

   The possible emergence of a third major outside
investor in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. could be a thorn in running
the troubled investment firm but Chairman Peter Cohen doesn't have
much choice, analysts said Wednesday.
   ``He's got to go somewhere to get some more capital and when you
need more equity capital you've got to pay the price,'' said
securities industry analyst Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical
Services.
   Revlon Inc. Chairman Ronald O. Perelman reportedly is
negotiating to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Shearson
in exchange for a large stake in the brokerage firm. At the same
time, the brokerage reportedly is preparing to raise up to $1
billion through a new securities offering.
   Perelman would invest $250 million in exchange for a stake in
the company of about 9.9 percent, The New York Times reported in
Thursday editions.
   On Wednesday, the Times reported that Perelman would be able to
obtain about 20 percent of Shearson's stock, or 17.5 million
shares, if he exercised all of his stock options under the deal as
originally proposed. The Times said in Thursday editions that the
planned transaction was altered to make it less complex, according
to the unidentified sources it cited.
   Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neil and Revlon spokesman Jim
Conroy declined to comment on the report in Wednesday's Times.
   Any such deal would provide needed capital for Shearson, which
is 61 percent owned by American Express Co. About 13 percent of
Shearson's stock is owned by Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Japan,
with the rest publicly traded.
   But Long said that further dividing the ownership of Shearson
among three large outsiders could prove to be a headache for
executives under pressure to turn around the firm's slumping
profits.
   A number of Wall Street observers have been waiting for Perelman
to make a move. He had been divesting some operations and amassing
a warchest of hundreds of millions of dollars for some time.
   Perelman was rebuffed two years ago in an effort to buy a block
of stock in Salomon Brothers Inc. and some say he still wants to
obtain a position of authority at a brokerage firm.
   Shearson also was said to be considering other deals, such as
obtaining more capital from American Express in exchange for
selling certain of the brokerage's assets, the Times said. The
Times said as many as seven investors had expressed interest in
buying into the firm.
   On Oct. 30, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it was mulling a
possible credit rating downgrade for Shearson's bonds and
commercial paper, due to the firm's Shearson's exposure in
debt-financed takeovers and a general slowdown in the securities
industry. Shearson has been trying to raise capital to prevent such
a move, which would raise its borrowing costs.
   A general slump in brokerage activity also has led Shearson to
realign its top management and begin a round of 800 layoffs in an
attempt to increase profitability and cut costs.
   American Express has long said it wants to cut its Shearson
holding to less than 50 percent to limit its exposure to the
vagaries of Shearson's earnings.
   Any deal involving the sale of Shearson shares could be slowed
or blocked by Nippon Life, which holds two seats on Shearson's
board and is its largest shareholder. The deal with Perelman would
make him the second-largest Shearson shareholder other than
American Express.
