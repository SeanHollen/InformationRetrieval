<HEAD>Bridges Pleads Innocent To Attempted Murder Charge</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead to reflect that Bridges' role in the shooting has
not been established.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Todd Bridges, a star in the NBC comedy
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' pleaded innocent Friday to attempted murder
charges stemming from an incident in which he allegedly shot a
roommate.
   Bridges shot Kenneth Clay as many as eight times in a Feb. 2
argument that stemmed from Clay having borrowed Bridges' BMW
automobile, according to testimony in the case.
   Another man, Harvey Duckett, 30, who was with Bridges during the
episode, also faces the attempted murder charge. But Duckett, who
has pleaded no contest, is testifying in the case in exchange for
leniency from prosecutors.
   Bridges, 23, was bound over to Superior Court last week by
Municipal Judge David Horwitz, who also refused to reduce Bridges'
$2 million bail.
   On Friday, Superior Court Judge David Horowitz scheduled a
pretrial hearing, trial setting and bail motions for April 14.
   In addition to his role as Gary Coleman's protective older
brother on ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' Bridges has appeared in ABC's
``Fish'' and has been on various installment of ``Circus of the
Stars.''
   During a preliminary hearing earlier this month, Bridges'
attorney, Johnnie Cochran argued for a reduction in charges,
contending Bridges was too drugged to premeditate attempted
first-degree murder. Witnesses testified that the actor ingested
rock cocaine at least four times on the day of the shooting.
   Clay described Bridges as ``based out'' from freebasing or
smoking cocaine. ``It was the worst I seen him. He looked like his
eyes were about to jump out of his head,'' Clay testified.

<HEAD>Contra Aid Plan Expected To Pass Congress, Despite Opposition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   House and Senate leaders predict smooth
sailing for a new policy toward Central America containing $45
million for Nicaraguan guerrillas even though some conservatives in
Congress say they will try to change it.
   Nicaragua's leftist government said it didn't like the U.S.
program either.
   In Managua, Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Alejandro Bendana
called the plan ``confusing and unclear'' and said it goes against
a regional pact that calls for dismantling the rebel force by
mid-May.
   ``Humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a
contradiction in terms,'' Bendana said.
   The new policy was announced at a White House news conference
Friday by President Bush and leaders of Congress and was hailed as
a bipartisan approach to foreign policy.
   In contrast to the bitter fights of the past decade over Central
America, Bush said Congress and the White House ``will be speaking
with one voice'' on the region.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III conceded the collapse of
the Reagan administration's effort to oust the leftist Sandinista
government of Nicaragua with a military victory by the Contra
rebels.
   ``We all have to admit that the policy basically failed to some
extent because we were not united,'' Baker said. ``We had an
executive branch going in one direction and a legislative branch
going in another.''
   ``Does it mean an end to the war? Let's hope so,'' Baker said.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros lauded the plan as a ``very
significant step'' that will keep their fighters alive while
diplomatic peace efforts are pursued.
   The agreement commits the administration to support Central
American peace efforts and provides for continuation of non-lethal
aid for the Contras for clothing, food, shelter and medical
supplies at the rate of $4.5 million a month through February 1990,
the date set for elections in Nicaragua.
   Moreover, the accord provides funds for the first time for the
voluntary resettlement of the Contras within Nicaragua to rejoin
political life there.
   Amid all the talk of bipartisanship, there was some grumbling.
An aide to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said conservative Senate
Republicans were particularly angry over the part of the accord
dealing with relocation of the Contras.
   ``Using the word relocation is a code word for sellout,'' said
the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Once you use that
word, it signifies that we're bailing out of this.''
   The aide said Helms planned to demand a vote on separate
legislation that would provide $75 million in ``non-lethal'' aid to
the rebels, including items like radios, gasoline and helicopter
parts that could not be bought under the administration's proposal.
   The $45 million outlay is expected to be approved by Congress
soon after it returns from its Easter break next month.
   The current appropriation of $27.1 million in humanitarian aid
expires next Friday. Congress halted military funding for the
Contras in February 1988.
   Baker said there were no plans to request further military aid.
But he added ``There is no bar or prohibition to that in this
agreement in the event that conditions should deteriorate
substantially.''
   The deal marks the first major element of Bush's emerging
foreign policy. It was the result of weeks of negotiation between
Baker and Congress. Many of the details were not spelled out in a
broadly worded two-page statement but were part of a ``gentlemen's
agreement.''
   Although it was not mentioned, a key ingredient was a promise by
Baker that would allow any of four congressional committees to cut
off the Contras' aid after November if it believed the presence of
the rebels was harming regional peace efforts, according to sources.
   Moreover, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the
administration had agreed that the Contras would not engage in
``military action for any offensive purpose.'' It was understood
that violations would result in an automatic end to the aid.
   Bush said a peace agreement signed by the leaders of Nicaragua,
Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala calls for ``a free,
open political process in which all groups can participate. The
playing field must be level.
   ``The burden of proof is on the Sandinista government to comply
with the promises that it has made since 1979,'' Bush said. ``And
if they comply, we have an opportunity to start a new day in
Central America.''
   The new accord was signed by Bush, Wright, House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill.; Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine; Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.; and House
Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   ``With regard to Nicaragua,'' the agreement said, ``the United
States is united in its goals: democratization, an end to
subversion and destabilization of its neighbors, an end to Soviet
bloc military ties that threaten U.S. and regional security.''
   While the Contra funding is expected to win congressional
approval, Dole said, ``Not every Republican senator is enthusiastic
about this program.'' Mitchell said the vote would not be unanimous
among Democrats either.
   But Wright said the program ``will deserve and will receive a
support of the majority in the Congress.''

   They led snake-dancing students in huge protests 20
years ago, but today Japan's radical leftists encounter the blank
stare of indifference in a land blessed with affluence greater than
anyone had dreamed.
   Although they got headlines with threatening to disrupt the
summer Olympics in Seoul and Emperor Hirohito's funeral, the
radicals clearly have lost the widespread support of those days
when student unrest swept campuses around the world.
   A former radical looked back on the zeal of his college days
with fondness, but said they are gone for good. The former member
of the Kakurokyo, or Revolutionary Workers Association, now is a
photographer for a conservative weekly news magazine.
   ``When we were college students, Marxism was a fad,'' he said,
asking that his name not be used. ``Students these days don't have
any philosophy.''
   He said affluence was the main reason radicalism has lost its
appeal, but revulsion over the bloody acts of ultra-left groups
also keeps their ranks small.
   Even housewives and businessmen sympathized with some protests a
generation ago, but the radical left sent itself into rapid decline
with events in 1972 that shocked the nation: the Japanese Red Army
attack at Israel's Lod Airport that killed 28 people and wounded
dozens, and the United Red Army slaughter of 14 members for alleged
ideological deviations.
   Police actions and internecine violence have left many of the
best-known radical groups defunct, weakened or based outside Japan.
   National police officials still fear the Japanese Red Army, but
say its membership has dwindled to about 20. It is based in Lebanon
and said to be run by Fusako Shigenobu, who once worked in a soy
sauce factory.
   Authorities believe the group is more capable of carrying out
terrorist operations abroad and cite its alleged involvement in an
explosion outside a U.S. military club in Naples last April. It
threatened to disrupt Hirohito's funeral in Feb. 24, but did not do
so.
   Another well-known terrorist group, the Red Army Faction formed
in 1969, is based in North Korea and has virtually no organization
left in Japan.
   Takuji Otsu, the lawyer for an admitted hijacker, said:
``Students today have the same amount of dissatisfaction with the
government, but they have a stronger sense of futility.''
   Otsu's client Yasuhiro Shibata, a 35-year-old member of the Red
Army Faction, is being tried on charges that include forgery,
hostage-taking and grand theft.
   Japan had no laws on hijacking in 1970, when Shibata _ then 16 _
and eight others used samurai swords and a bomb to hijack a Japan
Air Lines flight to North Korea.
   He was arrested last year in Japan after 15 years in Pyongyang,
capital of North Korea, and three years in which his movements are
unclear. His accomplices remain in Pyongyang, and one is believed
to have died.
   Involvement of a high school student in the hijacking stunned a
people already unsettled by demonstrations against the education
system, Vietnam War and a mutual security agreement with the United
States.
   Shibata still supports revolution but said he returned to Japan
to establish an economic and social foundation for a ``new kind of
political movement.''
   His lawyer said in an interview: ``It would be meaningless for
them to profess violence in today's society. I think they have
realized ... that they must do something more in tune with the
times.''
   According to Otsu, his client will not explain what kind of new
movement the radicals plan beyond saying it would ``try to solve
specific problems'' and would not recruit in the colleges.
   Kaoru Tsunoda, a junior at Japan Women's University in Tokyo,
said the leftist movement ``just doesn't have much to do with me. I
think making friends and creating a foundation for my own life is
what's important.''
   Miss Tsunoda said she had begun trying to keep up on politics,
but largely because she thinks it will help her chances for a good
job after graduation.
   A recent survey by the government Management and Coordination
Agency found young Japanese tend to be socially conservative,
apolitical and most interested in ``getting rich.''
   Even in the early 1970s, most abandoned activism after
graduation to avoid rejection by prospective employers.
   The most active radical group, the Chukaku-ha, is a direct
descendant of a faction-ridden movement of college students whose
violent revolt disrupted campuses in March 1969.
   Strikes affected more than half the 377 universities that year
and police arrested 10,000 students. They confiscated 12,000 wooden
staves, 4,000 iron bars and 4,000 firebombs.
   By 1985, arrests of radical leftists had fallen to about 100.
   In a report on 1988, the National Police Agency estimated the
number of radical leftists and anarchists in Japan at about 35,000,
compared with 53,500 in 1969, with the number of activists much
lower.
   Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction, has 3,000-5,000 members, and
several hundred radicals claim allegiance to the Kakurokyo
(Revolutionary Workers Association) and the Senki-ha, or Battle
Flag Faction.
   All three oppose the mainstream Japan Communist Party, which
they say is Stalinist and anti-revolutionary. The party denounces
them as Trotskyite adventurers.
   Dozens of deaths have been reported in factional fights between
the Chukaku-ha and the Kakumaru-ha, or Revolutionary Marxist
Faction, which supports the Communist Party.

<HEAD>Canadian Youth Fatally Shot At Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old Canadian youth was fatally
shot by a U.S. Border Patrol agent after illegally entering the
United States and brandishing what appeared to be a revolver,
authorities said Friday.
   The ``gun'' Jason Haring pointed at the patrol agent Thursday
night was actually a replica, they said.
   Border Patrolman Dale A. Rude shot Haring about 400 yards east
of the border station run by the U.S. Customs Service in Roosville
in northwest Montana, authorities said.
   Det. Lt. Don Bernall of the Lincoln County Sheriff's office said
the shooting occurred about 7 p.m. Thursday, after Haring had
crossed into the United States.
   Haring, from Kanata, Ontario, walked away from a youth detention
center in Bellville, Ontario, on March 11, authorities said.
   A trucker alerted officers at the station that Haring had been
hitchhiking and officers saw the boy get out of a car on the
Canadian side of the border, walk north along the highway and then
cut to the east, said Deputy Lincoln County Attorney Scott Spencer.
   Rude went up a hill to a vantage point often used by officers,
Spencer said. Rude spotted Haring through binoculars, then
confronted him about 80 feet over the border and told him to stop,
he said.
   Spencer said Rude told him Haring then turned, pulled what
appeared to be a pistol and pointed it at him. Rude said he fired
one shot from his 12-gauge shotgun at the youth from a distance of
12 to 15 feet, Spencer said.
   Haring died at the scene, shot in the right shoulder and chest,
officials said.
   Lincoln County Attorney Susan Loehn said Friday afternoon that
the fake gun Haring brandished looked surprisingly real. ``It has
so much detail that it's not what I think of as a toy gun,'' she
said.
   The county is still investigating the shooting and will decide,
after a coroner's inquest, whether to prosecute Rude, she said.
   The coroner's jury will make a recommendation on whether the
shooting was justifiable, Loehn said, adding she won't make any
decision on the matter until the inquest is completed.
   Jurors viewed Haring's body Friday, and an autopsy was conducted
Friday in Missoula, Loehn said. The inquest will not be held until
results are returned from the state crime laboratory, she said.

<HEAD>Lockheed Faces $1.5 Million Fine for Safety Violations at Stealth
Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of the stealth fighter is facing a
$1.5 million fine for more than 400 alleged violations of
worker-safety laws at the California plant where it assembled the
radar-evading plane.
   The fine against a division of the Lockheed Corp. was proposed
Friday by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which
also announced it was launching a ``wall-to-wall'' inspection of
the Burbank plant because of the alleged violations found during a
four-month review of the stealth project.
   Under OSHA procedures, Lockheed has 15 working days to contest
the proposed fine. Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said the company
had no immediate comment and likely would not comment until its
management had an opportunity to review the citations.
   OSHA cited 251 instances in which it said Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems Co. willfully failed to record illnesses and injuries to
employees and 88 alleged willful violations of federal regulations
requiring employers to inform workers about the potential dangers
of chemicals they work with and instruct them on proper safeguards.
   In addition, the company was cited for another 99 violations of
various OSHA standards, including alleged mislabeling or failure to
label chemical containers and alleged failure to include health
warnings on information the company was required to provide to its
workers.
   Other alleged violations included failing to list suspected
carcinogens on safety sheets provided to workers, overexposing
workers to asbestos and failure to provide workers with gloves
impervious to a hazardous chemical used on the fighter.
   The proposed fine follows an OSHA inspection based on numerous
complaints from workers at the plant, which employs about 14,000
people.
   In October, a month after the inspection began, John C.
Brizendine, the president of the division, said: ``We have seen
nothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentally
unsafe or pose a health hazard, provided proper procedures are
followed.''
   A month later the government for the first time publicly
acknowledged the existence of the stealth fighter, a single-seat,
dual-engine jet that resembles a bat and is formally designated the
F-117A.
   The Defense Department has ordered 59 stealth fighters; 52 had
been delivered as of the November showing.
   Seventy-five employees at the plant have a suit pending against
Lockheed and companies that make and supply the chemicals used to
help the fighter avoid radar detection. More than 100 workers have
filed workers compensation claims alleging they suffer from
injuries caused by the chemicals.
   The suit and the claims allege composite materials used in the
fighter and chemicals used to mill and clean those materials cause
rashes, nausea, dizziness, memory loss and concentration problems.
   OSHA spokesman Frank Kane said the fine represented the
ninth-largest in the agency's 17-year history and the largest ever
levied in California. The record fine was $5.1 million against two
companies involved in an April 1987 Bridgeport, Conn., building
collapse.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. official in charge of foreign
disaster relief is calling on nations around the world to ``put the
cash down'' and help avert a repetition of the massive starvation
that afflicted Sudan last year.
   Julia Taft, director of the State Department's Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance, said Friday that unless a U.N.-sponsored
emergency relief program succeeds, hundreds of thousands could be
lost.
   The United Nations estimated that more than 250,000 Sudanese
died of starvation last year because food deliveries were impeded
by the civil war between the Sudanese government and the Sudanese
Liberation People's Liberation Army.
   Ms. Taft discussed the U.S. role in Operation Lifeline, the
U.N.-sponsored effort designed to deliver more than 100,000 tons of
food to more than 1 million people next month. Project participants
say it is the largest effort of its kind in a developing nation.
   ``It's a race against time,'' Ms. Taft said, adding that unless
the Sudanese government, the rebels, the United Nations and the
donor nations pull together over the next few weeks ``we will see a
repeat of last year's horror.''
   April has been designated as a ``month of tranquility'' in
Sudan's civil conflict.
   ``Everybody wants peace, but peace will be a hollow victory if
the people for whom peace is the goal are not alive because we
can't deliver the food in time to save them,'' Ms. Taft said.
   The food is to be delivered by train, truck, barge and air to
remote areas in the south before seasonal rains and floods make
transport routes impassable.
   The cost of the U.N. project is $132 million, $55 million of
which still must be raised.
   Ms. Taft said the United States has arranged to provide some $30
million of that amount, and is trying to arrange for an additional
$10 million to pay for a ``food swap'' that would trade some foods
available in Sudan for others that certain segments of the society
need.
   The $30 million is in addition to some $72 million in various
forms of aid the United States has pledged to Sudan since last
February, Ms. Taft said.
   But the United States is concerned, because many nations that
have pledged to help the U.N. relief program with foodstuffs now
need to come forward with cash in order to adapt to the emergency,
month-long relief effort, Ms. Taft said.
   ``We will deliver. But we're quite concerned that the other
donors were not forthcoming. ... For some reason, we're out there
in front and we would like to expand the participation of other
donors in this urgent effort,'' she said. ``We hope the consciences
of these donors will find this opportunity to save lives and put
the cash down.''
   She said she hoped nations such as Japan and Saudi Arabia could
assist the effort. She noted that the Soviet Union was not at a
recent conference in Khartoum on the relief effort ``but they might
well be asked (to contribute). Since their own disaster, they know
the importance of an international effort.''
   She said it was up to the United Nations to formally make such a
request.
   Ms. Taft said she feared that because the crisis had not had the
media coverage of the 1984 famine in Ethiopia, or even the December
Soviet earthquake in Armenia, the international community was not
aware of the severity of the tragedy, even though many nations are
usually more than willing to help.
   ``Some disasters get such broad international coverage, the
whole world feels as though they had come to the aid of mankind,''
Ms. Taft said.
   Ms. Taft, who will be in the region with a congressional
delegation next week, said the traditional donor nations, such as
the British, Dutch, Canadians and Italians, are all being asked to
provide additional funding.

<HEAD>Government Will Fight Effort To Have Reagan Testify for North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will try to block Oliver
North's effort to get former President Reagan to testify as leadoff
witness for the defense at the Iran-Contra trial next week.
   The government has a court motion pending to quash the subpoena
for Reagan and ``we will pursue that matter,'' David Runkel, an
aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said Friday.
   The defense sought a court order seeking the former president's
appearance next Friday following testimony in the past month at
North's trial that Reagan was deeply involved in helping the
Contras.
   The judge in the North case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, is expected to schedule a hearing for next week to consider
the defense request.
   Reagan and then-Vice President George Bush got subpoenas from
North on Dec. 30 to testify at his trial but sought through the
Justice Department to have them quashed. Gesell dismissed Bush's
subpoena, but held Reagan's open, pending trial developments.
   ``The importance of Mr. Reagan's testimony to the defense of
this case is clear both from the record in the trial to date and
from'' a filing in January by North, defense attorney Brendan
Sullivan said in a court filing.
   North's lawyers argued Jan. 23 that concerns about privileges
for confidential communications and state secrets must yield to a
demonstrated need for testimony.
   Subpoenas for the appearances of Reagan and Bush ``raise
profound constitutional concerns,'' Thornburgh argued in January.
   The concerns are in connection with ``executive privilege ...
but also regarding the authority of the courts to compel
appearances by a former or sitting president,'' Thornburgh said at
the time.
   ``The spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjected
to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the
way they deal with the president now and in the future,''
Thornburgh said.
   Reagan told the Tower commission investigating the Iran-Contra
arms and money affair in January 1987 that he did not know his
National Security Council staff _ including North _ was helping the
Contras.
   According to testimony at North's trial, Reagan, based on NSC
staff recommendations:
   _Secretly approved slipping $110 million worth of extra aid to
Honduras as an enticement for supporting the Contras.
   _Telephoned the president of Honduras to gain release of an arms
shipment that had been seized by the Honduran military while en
route to the Contras.
   _Apparently approved airdropping intelligence and recoilless
rifles to the Contras to destroy ships carrying arms to Nicaragua.
   The activities in question came in 1985 when Congress had banned
U.S. military aid to the Contras.
   Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane testified that
when Reagan learned of a Contra contribution from a foreign
country, the president said ``we shouldn't share that with
Congress.''
   ``He did not say to lie about it,'' McFarlane said of Reagan.
``He just said do not share that information.''
   North faces 12 criminal charges, including six alleging he lied
to Congress about his activities on behalf of the Contras.

<TEXT>
   When former President Reagan took office in
1981, his policy of financing the Contra rebels in their war
against Nicaragua's Sandinista government became one of the most
divisive foreign policy questions facing Congress. Here is a
year-to-year chronology of the ups and downs of that policy:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1981 _ As part of classified intelligence bill, Congress
approves $19 million for rebels in covert military aid to be
managed by CIA.
   1982 _ Second infusion of $19 million, again part of classified
bill, is approved. Restrictive provisions are added to prevent
money from being used to overthrow Sandinista government. There are
reports that CIA has used additional $10 million from its
contingency fund.
   1983 _ House votes to end Contra aid, but later compromise
approves $24 million for rebels. Money is appropriated openly, and
CIA is barred from using any of its contingency fund to supplement
new aid.
   1984 _ Congress votes to cut off aid after reports surface in
April that CIA has supervised mining of Nicaraguan ports. At end of
year, lawmakers vote to set aside $14 million for Contras, to be
released after Feb. 28, 1985, if Congress approves in separate vote
at that time. Congress adds restrictions, saying CIA and Pentagon
may not use money to support paramilitary operations in Nicaragua
unless specifically authorized by Congress.
   1985 _ Senate votes to release the $14 million, but House votes
against resolution. That summer, Congress approves $27 million for
Contras but restricts use to ``humanitarian'' aid. Money is
directed to be used as leverage to promote peace negotiations.
Defense Department and CIA are barred from any role in distributing
money.
   1986 _ In fall, Congress approves $100 million _ largest single
appropriation for rebels _ bulk of it for military aid.
Restrictions on CIA's role are lifted, except that agency remains
barred from using its contingency fund.
   1987 _ In March, House passes moratorium on Contra aid in effort
to hold up final $40 million of aid bill approved in 1986, but
measure dies in Senate. At end of fiscal year, on Sept. 30,
Congress begins series of stopgap funding measures that include
money for ``non-lethal'' aid totaling another $20 million.
   1988 _ House on Feb. 3 kills Reagan's request for $36 million in
rebel aid, and later it rejects Democratic alternative of $30
million. Rebels reach negotiated truce with Sandinistas on March
23, and Congress votes to provide $48 million. Peace talks break
down in June and U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton is expelled from
Nicaragua a month later, although truce remains in effect. A $47.1
million aid proposal fails to win congressional approval that
summer.
   1989 _ President Bush announces $4.5-million-per-month,
bipartisan plan that provides for continuation of non-lethal
humanitarian aid to Contras through February 1990, date set for
elections in Nicaragua. Agreement offers money that rebels can use
to resettle in their homeland.

<HEAD>Cheney Says Welch Didn't Speak Officially on MX, Midgetman Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Larry Welch D.
Welch drew the wrath of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney for
reportedly discussing with members of Congress how to update the
U.S. nuclear deterrent.
   Cheney said Friday that Welch wasn't speaking for the
department, had no right do so and would be rebuked for doing it.
   ``General Welch was free-lancing,'' Cheney told reporters,
saying no decisions on the issue had been reached.
   ``I think it's inappropriate for a uniformed officer to be in a
position where he is, in fact, negotiating an arrangement,'' Cheney
said. ``I will make known to him my displeasure. He was not
speaking for the department.'
   A spokesman for Welch, who is the Air Force's top military
officer, said Welch had no comment.
   Cheney said ``all of our options are open'' when it comes to the
future of the land-based nuclear missile force.
   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration before
it, is trying to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missile
to America's arsenal.
   The Pentagon has told Congress it would like to buy 50 more of
the 10-warhead MX missiles and place them on rail-car launchers.
Congressional Democrats, however, would prefer to see the
development of a small, single-warhead Midgetman missile that could
be deployed on a truck launcher.
   Welch and Navy Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, have been searching in recent days for a
compromise.
   According to some members of Congress, Welch has suggested a
compromise in which 50 MX missiles already deployed in silos would
be shifted to rail launchers _ instead of purchasing new missiles _
while the number of Midgetman missiles to be built would be scaled
back from 500 to 300.
   But Cheney said no decision had been made.
   ``To say that a compromise is near, I think, would be
premature,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney declined to discuss cutting the Pentagon's budget, as
President Bush has instructed, saying he needed more time to review
programs.
   He did say that as a general priority he would rather reduce the
size of the armed forces instead of returning to the days of a
``hollow'' military without adequate ammunition or spare parts.
   In another development Friday, acting Air Force Secretary James
F. McGovern said he will step down later this spring to seek a job
in the private sector.
   McGovern has served as the undersecretary, or No. 2, man, in the
Air Force's hierarchy since November 1986 and as the acting
secretary since last December.
   An associate of former Sen. John Tower, McGovern had been widely
expected to take on the Air Force post on a permanent basis had
Tower been confirmed as the secretary of defense.
   Tower's nomination was rejected two weeks ago by the Senate and
President Bush replaced him with Cheney.
   ``In a meeting I had with Defense Secretary Cheney earlier this
week, I indicated that I was inclined to return to the private
sector so that I could finally give my two daughters the attention
they deserve and to pursue several other professional interests,''
McGovern said in a prepared statement.
   An aide said McGovern is planning to leave in May. The aide, who
asked not to be named, insisted that the controversy involving
Welch had played no role in McGovern's decision.

<HEAD>Air Force Studies B-1B Structure in Wake of B-1B Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force says it has changed maintenance
procedures for the B-1B's fuel system and is studying whether
structural changes should be made to the aircraft in the wake of a
crash last November.
   But the service on Friday denied it had found any design or
maintenance problems that contributed to the Nov. 8 accident near
Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
   An internal Air Force report, first disclosed by WBNS-TV in
Columbus, Ohio, raised questions about the fuel system's design,
according to officials Friday who spoke on condition they not be
named.
   Whatever the exact cause, ``a B-1 design deficiency allowed the
fuel in the overwing fairing to migrate into the compartment
containing the environmental system precooler, which reaches
temperatures sufficient to provide ignition,'' the internal
document said.
   The internal document elaborated on the findings of an accident
report the Air Force made public in February on the Texas crash.
   The public report concluded the B-1B crashed because a fire in
the left wing knocked out two of the plane's four engines and
burned out critical control equipment. All four crewmen parachuted
to safety.
   The public report also said the fire apparently had been fed by
a ruptured fuel line in the portion of the wing that runs above the
left engines, but added the crash impact had ``destroyed evidence
necessary to further isolate the cause of the fire and the exact
location of the fuel leak.''
   The crew received no warning of a fire ``due to lack of a fire
detection system'' in that section of the plane, the internal
report says.
   When they did realize the plane was on fire, they ``had no means
to shut off fuel flow ... or suppress the fire'' in that area, says
the document.
   The Air Force, in its statement Friday, acknowledged the
internal report had spawned a new study that could lead to
structural changes.
   ``The B-1B program office is also assessing engineering
proposals to design a fuel isolation and fire detection capability
for the overwing fairing areas,'' the Air Force said.
   Addressing questions about the internal document, the public
statement said, ``It is a longstanding Air Force policy not to
discuss details of these accident investigation reports.''
   ``But no serious problems in the fuel lines were identified
during the course of the investigation or at any other time.
Additionally, no maintenance inadequacies were identified,'' the
statement said. ``However, the Air Force is aggressively
implementing precautionary measures to prevent any possibility of a
recurrence. These actions include inspections of key areas and the
addition of some maintenance procedures.''

<TEXT>
   Police had to climb a roof and shout
down a chimney to read a burglary suspect his rights after the man
got stuck while allegedly trying to enter a doctor's office.
   James Edward Burgess, 31, was out of the chimney and in jail
Friday on a commercial burglary charge.
   ``I thought it was comical that someone could be so stupid,''
said Dr. George Foster who was awakened at home to let police into
his office.
   Rescuers said they used a truck and rope to hoist Burgess to
safety Thursday.
   ``There were three or four fire trucks out here, the cherry
picker _ it looked like the Florida state fair,'' said Foster.
   ``All I could see were his feet dangling,'' added the
44-year-old gynecologist and obstetrician. ``And unless he was
after birth control pills for his girlfriend, there's absolutely
nothing for him to take.''
   The 180-pound suspect was lodged about midway down the chimney.
Officer Wade Kollar stood on the rooftop of a single-story
structure to advise him of his right to remain silent, according to
police reports.
   ``We wore out all of the Christmas jokes,'' said Fire Department
Lt. Rob Edwards.
   After an alarm was triggered, an officer scaled the building and
discovered the suspect, police spokesman George Pinckney said.
   Edwards said the burglar apparently slipped, fell down the chute
and got caught with one arm pinned at his side.

<HEAD>Bush Nominates Taft as NATO Ambassador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William H. Taft IV, acting defense secretary
for the first two months of the Bush administration, is President
Bush's nominee as the U.S. representative to NATO.
   In making the announcement Friday, Bush also said he would
nominate former Republican Sen. Chic Hecht of Nevada to be
ambassador to the Bahamas. Both nominations, as well as several
others announced by the White House, require Senate confirmation.
   At the same time Bush took the unusual step of withdrawing his
earlier nomination of Pentagon official Richard L. Armitage as
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
The president picked Richard H. Solomon for the post instead.
   Bush said Armitage would remain at the Pentagon ``in a senior
position which will be announced at a later date.''
   Administration sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
have said that Cheney has asked Armitage to stay on, possibly as
secretary of the Navy.
   Hecht served one term in the Senate but was defeated in a
re-election bid last year by Democrat Richard H. Bryan, a former
Nevada governor. Hecht would succeed Carol Boyd Hallett.
   Taft, 43, oversaw daily Pentagon operations as acting defense
secretary during the confirmation process for John Tower.
   The great-grandson of the nation's 27th president, Taft has been
deputy defense secretary since 1984, serving under defense
secretaries Caspar Weinberger and Frank Carlucci.
   Taft would have ambassadorial status and would succeed Alton
Keel as the permanent U.S. representative to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   Solomon would succeed Gaston Sigur Jr. He has been director of
the State Department's policy and planning staff since 1986.
   A former political science professor at the University of
Michigan, Solomon also was a senior staff member on the National
Security Administration in the Nixon administration. From 1976 to
1986, he was the head of the Rand Corp.'s political science
department.
   In other personnel announcements, the White House said Bush
would nominate:
   _Charles E. Redman, who has served as assistant secretary of
state for public affairs and its chief spokesman since 1986, to be
ambassador to Sweden. He would succeed Gregory J. Newell.
   _Joseph B. Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real estate
executive, to be ambassador to Switzerland. He would succeed Philip
D. Winn.
   _Paul Matthews Cleveland, a former ambassador to New Zealand and
to Western Samoa, to be ambassador to Malaysia. He would succeed
John Cameron Monjo.
   _John J. Maresca, deputy assistant defense secretary for
European and NATO policy, as chief of the U.S. delegation to the
recently opened East-West talks in Geneva intended to reduce
tensions in Western Europe.
   _Edward Nokonan Ney to be ambassador to Canada. Since 1986, he
has been vice chairman of Paine Webber Group Inc. and was a member
of the Grace Commission, which studied waste and inefficiencies in
government. He would succeed Thomas Michael Tolliver Niles.

<TEXT>
   Maybe the singers at the Metropolitan Opera were
especially ``up'' for their performances Friday night because they
were being videotaped. Whatever the reason, the season's first
performance of ``Die Walkure'' was glorious.
   In the first act, tenor Gary Lakes as Siegmund, soprano Jessye
Norman as Sieglinde and bass Matti Salminen as her husband,
Hunding, all displayed rich, even lush voices.
   Wotan, leader of the gods, comes into the picture in Act 2. He
was sung by James Morris, whose voice is brighter than many basses
who sing Wotan. His wife, Fricka, was sung by Christa Ludwig in a
way that sounded more like explaining than laying down the law.
   Hildegard Behrens, as Wotan's warrior daughter, Brunnhilde, was
girlishly exuberant at first. Later, when she has less to be
exuberant about, she maintained an attractive girlish quality in
her singing.
   A variety of vocal shadings kept the singing interesting. Miss
Norman particularly had many colors and textures in her singing.
   Morris, Salminen and Miss Norman were singing their parts at the
Met for the first time.
   All of the Valkyries sang well. The orchestra played beautifully
under the baton of James Levine. Orchestral interludes were
lovingly presented. Their tempo seemed slow at first but it was
never slack.
   Another performance of ``Die Walkure'' this season will be taped
also, and the other three of Wagner's ``Ring Cycle'' operas will be
videotaped next season. The four will be televised by PBS in June
1990.

<HEAD>Sentencing Of Gang Members Doesn't End Drug Problem, Prosecutors
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUSTIN BURKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said they scored a big victory when
nine members of what was once the city's largest drug ring received
lengthy federal prison terms, but they added that the fight is far
from over.
   ``It's a continuing problem, and I'm not going to say we've
turned the corner yet,'' said U.S. Attorney Roy C. Hayes, who
prosecuted the case. ``But we've made a significant dent.''
   U.S. District Judge Richard F. Suhrheinrich gave the maximum
prison term to eight of the nine Chambers Brothers gang members
sentenced Friday. The members were convicted Oct. 28 following a
six-week trial.
   ``There are crimes against civilization for which there is no
excuse ... and this is one them,'' Suhrheinrich said. ``How can we
have any regard for people who are destroying future generations?''
   So far, no drug gang has succeeded in replacing the Chambers
Brothers, although many are vying for the role, Hayes said.
   ``I'm hoping that the era of big drug gangs in Detroit has ended
with this trial,'' Hayes said. ``What we've shown is that a big,
powerful and violent drug gang can be put out of business.''
   There is no shortage of drug suspects, according to police
statistics. Drug-related arrests in Detroit increased 123 percent
in the 12 months ending Nov. 30, 1988, compared with the same
12-month period the previous year, police spokesman Christopher
Buck said.
   Buck said the increase does not mean the drug problem in Detroit
has worsened. The rise in drug arrests from 4,102 in 1986-87 to
9,520 in 1987-88 was due primarily to an anti-crack offensive that
helped reduce overall crime, he said.
   Suhrheinrich said he imposed the maximum sentence possible in
most cases because of the seriousness of the crack threat in
Detroit.
   ``It (crack) is indeed doing to our poor people what no person
could do. It is enslaving them,'' Suhrheinrich said before
sentencing. ``It's doing what Hitler could never do to us.''
   Larry Chambers, 39, the reputed leader of the gang, was
sentenced to life in prison and a $250,000 fine for operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Billy Joe Chambers, 26, was sentenced to more than 45 years and
a $500,000 fine for conspiracy and operating a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   Otis Chambers was sentenced to more than 27 years and a $350,000
fine for conspiracy and Willie Chambers was sentenced to more than
21 years and a $350,000 fine for conspiracy and tax evasion.
   Also convicted of conspiracy and sentenced Friday were gang
members Eric L. Wilkins, more than 33 years in prison; Elaine
Coleman Lucas, 10 years; Belinda Lumpkin, 25 years, Jerry Gant, 30
years, and Marshall Glenn, 30 years.
   Only Lucas received less than the maximum sentence because of
her minor role in the ring, the judge said.
   The Chambers Brothers gang was notorious for its corporatelike
structure, according to witnesses' testimony. The ring supplied
cocaine to as many as half of Detroit's estimated 1,000 crack
houses from 1982 until 1988, prosecutors said.
   Hayes said the stiff sentences will send an important message to
would-be drug dealers battling to fill the void created by breakup
of the Chambers gang.
   Police alone can't stem the tide of drugs in Detroit,
Suhrheinrich said in an often emotional 20-minute pre-sentencing
speech.
   ``Where is the community? Where is the press? Where is the
mayor? Where is the governor? Where is the president?''
Suhrheinrich said. ``Until we in the United States demand and are
allowed to walk down streets without drug dealers putting us in
fear, then we will never improve our institutions.''

   In issuing its notice on Friday, the IRS agreed to lower the
standards for wholesaler distributors ad some retailers to qualify
for an exemption from the 15.1-cent-a-gallon tax for sales to
farmers, fishermen and others who buy diesel for off-road use.
   For example, one new standard will allow distributors to
automatically qualify for an exemption if at least 70 percent of

   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here Thursday, is the

   A union spokeswoman said the Education Department on Feb. 21
distributed to employees a notice that the testing program would

compliance with an executive order issued by then-President Reagan
requiring them to draft drug-testing programs, routinely give

   The favorites for a big-screen comeback were E.T., the space
creature who rocketed to fame in 1982, and Katharine Hepburn, who
made her film debut in 1932.
   In a questionnaire filled out by more than 15,000 readers, E.T.

   Wade Boggs says the last thing he wanted was for
his wife to find out about his four-year affair with Margo Adams
and he didn't break it off for a long time because Adams threatened
to make his life a ``living hell.''
   In an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters on ``20-20'' Friday
night, the Boston Red Sox third baseman said he worried that Adams
would blackmail him with photographs she had taken of them.
   ``I was between a rock and a hard place,'' Boggs said. ``She had
so many pictures of me ... that I felt that if I make her mad,
she's gonna do something.
   ``And one thing she told me was ... `If you ever break up with
me, I'll make your life living hell.' And this is as close to hell
as you can get, I guess.''
   Boggs, a five-time American League batting champion, broke off
his affair with Adams last year. She is now suing him for wages
allegedly lost during their time together.
   Asked why she didn't leave her husband when she learned of the

   New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor,
whose drug problem drew a one-month suspension last year, failed a
breath test and was arrested when a trooper found him asleep in his
car on the side of a highway.
   ``This was the first alcohol he has consumed in the last five
months and he got ill,'' said Steve Rosner, an agent who handles
Taylor's endorsements. ``He had a little bit of a family quarrel
and that led to him having a drink or two.''
   He said Taylor had parked early Friday along the side of the
Garden State Parkway.
   State police Sgt. Robert Kenyon declined to say whet level of
alcohol Taylor's test showed. ``He failed. They gave him a summons
for driving while intoxicated,'' said Kenyon.
   But Rosner said that according to the citation Taylor was given,
he did not exceed the 0.10 percent blood alcohol level considered
legally drunk under New Jersey law.
   Taylor, who entered a drug treatment program in 1986, was
released on his own recognizance, police said. His car was
impounded.

construction site in central India overturned, killing at least 16
workers and injuring 17, a news report said today.
   The Press Trust of India said the accident occurred Friday near
the Bango dam site in Madhya Pradesh state, 580 miles southeast of
New Delhi.
   The injured were taken to Bilaspur, 95 miles from the
construction site, the news agency said. It quoted officials as
saying most were in stable condition.

   A satellite circled Earth on a
missile-hunting assignment today as part of research into a
spaced-based defense system after passing its first tracking test
within hours of soaring into orbit.
   The 3-ton Delta Star payload rocketed into space Friday to begin
a monthslong mission during which it is to aim its sensors at
several ground-based missile and space launches.
   The research could help perfect the technology for detecting and
destroying enemy missiles within minutes after they leave their
launch pads.
   The satellite passed its first trial within two hours after
liftoff when it successfully tracked the thrusting second stage of
its own Delta booster rocket after separation and during its fiery
destruction in the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
   ``We watched that burn with the sensors. We not only got the
second stage burning, but we also got the re-entry and breakup,''
said Air Force Col. Michael Rendine, program manager for the
Strategic Defense Initiative Office. ``We had a perfect ride into
space, and the spacecraft is operating just like we expected it
to.''
   Researchers especially want to gather rocket exhaust data
against the background of the North Pole region, an area through
which attacking Soviet missiles would travel.
   ``We'll observe a large number of booster rockets as well as
characterize a number of backgrounds, such as the aurora borealis
(northern lights),'' said Michael Griffin, director of technology
for the Strategic Defense Initiative Office. ``We have to know what
rockets look like from space when they are launched from the ground
against various environmental backgrounds.''
   Rendine said the Delta Star experiment is part of the research
being done for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars,
program to develop a space-based missile defense system.
   The satellite carried laser radar, seven video imaging cameras,
and an infrared imager. A Laser Illumination Detection System was
designed to spot ground-based laser firings, a capability that
would permit future satellites to take evasive action.
   Using a 48-jet thruster aiming system, Delta Star has the
capability to maneuver into position to spot the blazing plume of
missiles and rockets to be launched over the next several months
from Cape Canaveral; Wallops Island, Va.; White Sands, N.M.; Poker
Flats, Alaska; Barking Sands, Hawaii, and perhaps from Soviet
launch sites.
   Besides quickly locating a rocket plume, researchers want the
sensors to gather information to help distinguish various
backgrounds such as land, ocean, horizon, space, atmospheric
effects and the aurora borealis.
   As envisioned by former President Reagan who proposed it in
1983, the Stars Wars defense shield would include several hundred
large orbiting platforms equipped with rockets and hundreds of
supporting surveillance and tracking satellites.
   But the program, on which $16 billion has been spent so far, has
met with increasing resistance from a budget-minded Congress, and
officials have spoken in recent months of a modified or scaled-down
system. President Bush has said he supports it, but his
administration is reviewing other strategic systems as well.
   Vice President Dan Quayle earlier this week endorsed a new
version of the program known as ``brilliant pebbles,'' citing its
small size, comparatively low cost and fast schedule for
development.
   The ``brilliant pebbles'' technology would involve thousands of
small satellites that could home in on enemy missiles and destroy
them by colliding with them.

<HEAD>Stunned Agency Reverses Permission Granted to Import 400,000 Guns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department's bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms has ordered the Customs Service to halt
shipments of more than 400,000 military-style assault weapons at
the nation's borders, a newspaper reported.
   Bureau officials, stunned that hundreds of thousands of weapons
such as the AK-47 had already been approved for import, in effect
is rescinding that approval, the Los Angeles Times reported in its
Saturday editions.
   The action goes beyond steps taken earlier in March when the
Bush administration announced a temporary ban on issuing of new
permits for five types assault weapon, including the AK-47, the
weapon used earlier this year in a massacre of schoolchildren in
Stockton, Calif.
   William T. Drake, a top official at ATF, acknowledged in an
interview with the Times that the move would be controversial. But
he said an internal audit detailing the vast extent of imports
already authorized had persuaded the agency to take the emergency
action.
   The bureau declined to disclose how many weapons have been
approved for import, but an unidentified Customs Service source
cited by the Times said the number is more than 400,000.
   The weapons were not affected by the moratorium, which only
blocked approval of new applications for weapons imports. When the
action was taken, new applications to import 110,000 assault
weapons were pending.
   The moratorium will be lifted only if importers can prove that
the weapons are used generally for sporting purposes.
   About 70,000 assault rifles have been imported into the United
STates in the last three years, according to the agency.
   The ATF order was transmitted orally Thursday and made formal in
a directive issued by Drake on Friday.

<TEXT>
   An island in the Firth of Forth
that may have inspired Robert Louis Stevenson's ``Treasure Island''
has been purchased by admirers of its resident seabirds.
   The Royal Society for the Preservation of Birds said Friday it
had purchased 12-acre Fidra island for $3,200 from the Northern
Lighthouse Board, whose former employees include Stevenson's father.
   ``Robert Louis Stevenson was brought up in Edinburgh, and his
family spent holidays for many years at North Berwick,'' said Iain
Illingworth, the society's reserves manager for east Scotland.
   Fidra, 15 miles east of Edinburgh and a half-mile off shore in
the river Forth, has a 56-foot high lighthouse and ruins of a
12th-century chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas.
   ``I don't think there is any very hard evidence, but it is
believed that it is the inspiration for `Treasure Island,'''
Illingworth said.
   The treeless island's 50-foot cliffs are ``a very important site
for nesting seabirds, and it's important that it be allowed to
carry on,'' said Illingworth. Among the residents are puffins,
kittiwakes, razorbills, guillemots, fulmars and shags.
   More than 200 eider duck nests were found on the island last
year, he said.
   ``It's only sort of 15 miles from Edinburgh, yet it's a jewel in
the Firth of Forth. Because it is very little visited and it has
these cliffs, it's an excellent place for birds to breed,''
Illingworth said.

   For the past month, Andrea Gail Cervantes has made
her family crack their eggs at the top, not in the middle.
   That's so they can fill them with confetti, decorate them and
smash the eggs _ called cascarones _ on the heads of friends and
relatives, a tradition in the Cervantes family and many other
Mexican-American families for generations.
   The Spanish word for eggshell is cascaron, and for many
Mexican-American families they are an essential part of Easter
celebrations.
   ``It's a tradition Mexicans are reared on,'' said Ms. Cervantes'
mother, also named Andrea.
   For some families, it's a yearlong project.
   Judith Zaffirini, a state senator from Laredo has been saving
eggshells since last Easter.
   ``We collect year-round. We never stop,'' said Mrs. Zaffirini,
who has a 7-year-old son. ``I keep them in the cabinets in the
kitchen. At Christmas, that's when we really collect a lot of
cascarones because I make a lot of sweets.
   ``But this year we have fewer Easter eggs because my husband
used to eat two eggs for breakfast, now he only has one.''
   Last year, the Zaffirini family collected more than 100 dozen
eggshells.
   The craft of filling the eggs with confetti and covering the
shells with tissue paper can be a profitable business, especially
this time of year.
   Jesse Moreno, special activities coordinator for El Mercado (The
Market) in downtown San Antonio, said some vendors sell the eggs
all year.
   San Antonio residents not only purchase cascarones for Easter
celebrations, they also stockpile them for Fiesta, a weeklong,
citywide celebration of parades and parties that follow Easter.
   Vendors along the Texas border with Mexico sell cascarones by
the bag, with customers able to get 100 for about $1.50.
   Stories of cascarones' origination vary, but all seem to tie it
to Europe.
   A 1980 brochure published by the Conservation Society in San
Antonio said perfume-filled eggshells were used in Italy during the
Renaissance. According to that account, Carlotta, wife of
Maximillian, an Austrian duke who established an empire in Mexico
for Napoleon III, brought them with her to Mexico.
   Moreno said perfume-filled cascarones were brought to Italy from
China by Marco Polo. They eventually made their way into Spain and
then to Mexico. Somewhere along the line, the perfume was replaced
with confetti, he said.
   The empty eggshell is said to symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus
Christ. The colorful confetti is a reminder of the joy of the
Christian belief in Christ's resurrection.
   The cascarones are the center of many celebrations such as
birthdays, weddings and even Christmas, but are most important at
Easter.
   Families often color and fill the shells together.
   Like hard-boiled Easter eggs, cascarones are placed in baskets
or hidden. But often, the eggs are carried to a picnic spot in a
park where children and adults try to sneak up and smash the eggs
on each others' heads.
   ``I sit down with the kids and we paint and decorate them. It's
a lot of fun and we can share a moment or two and do things
together,'' said Eddie Lucio, a state representative from
Brownsville, who says he also made cascarones as a youngster.
   ``We do get together and set out some ground rules, and rule No.
1 is not to get mad. Rule No. 2 is not to hurt anybody and rule No.
3 is to clean up the mess,'' Lucio said.

<HEAD>Adams' First Full Day Back Home Is A Quiet One</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Randall Dale Adams attended a quiet family
gathering and toured his hometown during his first full day back
since his release from prison.
   But the man who spent 12 years behind bars in Texas for a crime
he says he didn't commit appeared less concerned about the future
than about adjusting to the life he left in 1977 _ when he was
sentenced to death.
   ``To be able to dress like a human being again _ that adds to
your self-confidence,'' Adams said Friday at a relative's home
south of Columbus. ``To be able to go out among people and not be
an inmate, a convict, that improves (your outlook).''
   Adams' case had garnered wide attention after ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' a documentary, raised doubts about his guilt in the
shooting death of Dallas officer Robert Wood.
   He came within three days of execution in 1980 for the murder
before his sentence was commuted to life in prison.
   At the family gathering, Adams told Columbus television station
WBNS that he received a card containing a check from an anonymous
source in the mail Friday. He didn't reveal the amount of the check.
   Adams, 40, who worked as a clerk in the prison maintenance
office and earned an associate degree in general studies while
imprisoned, said he has no immediate job plans. Columbus Mayor Dana
Rinehart has offered him unspecified employment with the city.
   He was greeted by yellow ribbons and rousing cheers when he
returned Thursday to Columbus.
   On March 1, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had ordered a
new trial for him, saying a witness had lied and a prosecutor
suppressed evidence. And on Thursday, the Dallas County, Texas,
district attorney dropped the case against him, citing a lack of
evidence.
   Adams spent much of his day out of the public eye.
   All was quiet at the blue and white trailer home on the city's
west side where Adams' mother, Mildred, has lived since she sold
her house in suburban Grove City to help pay her son's legal bills.
   Mrs. Adams said her son embarked on a tour of the city early in
the morning with filmmaker Errol Morris, who directed ``The Thin
Blue Line.''
   In Texas, a juror said she was convinced she had erred in
declaring Adams guilty.
   ``If he had gone to the death chamber and all this had come out
later, that would have been a horrible thing to have on my
conscience,'' said Bette Jane Fain, the jury forewoman at Adams'
1977 trial.

   UNITA guerrillas claim to have shot down
a Soviet-built transport plane supplying government troops in
southern Angola.
   A statement monitored in Lisbon from the rebel's stronghold in
Jamba, Angola, said the Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft was struck Friday
by UNITA anti-aircraft fire and crashed near Menongue. The
statement, which said government forces are massing in the south,
did not elaborate.
   There was no immediate comment from the government.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has been fighting a civil war against the Angolan government
since shortly after the country gained independence from Portugal
in 1975.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi rejects a U.S.-sponsored peace
agreement signed last December in which 50,000 Cuban troops
supporting the Marxist-orientated government have began leaving
Angola.
   Under the terms of the agreement, South Africa pledges to halt
military aid to UNITA and withdraw from neighboring Namibia, which
South African troops used as a base for raids into Angola in
support of Savimbi.
   The United States continues to assist the rebels, while the
Soviet Union supplies government forces.

   A U.S. Air Force plane mistakenly dropped a dummy
bomb on a dairy pasture last week during bombing drills, the
Defense Facilities Administration office said today.
   The March 16 mishap occurred when an F-16 fighter jet dropped a
25-pound non-explosive bomb during bombing practice drills, said
Masayuki Sato of the Defense Facilities Administration office.
   The bomb landed 40 feet from a dormitory for farm workers but no
damage was reported, he said.
   Sato said the U.S. Air Force reported the accident was due to
human error, not mechanical failure, and apologized. The U.S.
military declined to identify the pilot.
   F-16 fighter planes routinely engage in bombing drills at a
practice range 25 miles north of Misawa Air Base, 350 miles
northwest of Tokyo.
   Kyodo News Service said the mishap occurred near a proposed
nuclear fuel reprocessing center, which local residents have
protested as dangerous because it is too close to the military base.
   The area of the proposed plant, to be partially opened in 1991,
is within the area where the U.S. Air Force makes 42,000 flights a
year, the project's contractors were quoted as telling Kyodo.

<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old boy whose footprints led
to the edge of a 500-foot-deep, abandoned mine shaft was found dead
Friday night after searchers built a road to the site and then
shored up the unstable opening, authorities said.
   ``At 10:41 p.m., the body was brought up out of the shaft,''
said Gilpin County dispatcher Dodie Shaw.
   She said the body of the child, identified as Michael Mills, was
recovered from a depth of about 200 feet.
   Authorities said the toddler's babysitter was watching the boy
Friday afternoon, then went inside for a moment to answer the
telephone. When she returned, about 2:45 p.m., the boy was gone.
   Searchers followed the boy's tracks from his home to the mine
shaft about 100 yards away.
   ``The little footprints in the snow went up to the shaft. There
were no other tracks. They did see the slide marks that went down''
into the mouth of the shaft, said Gilpin County Sheriff Rosetta
Anderle.
   Search of the abandoned mine shaft was delayed several hours as
a 200-yard road had to be cut to the hilly site.
   Then heavy timbers were placed across the unstable shaft opening
and a network of chains and cables rigged for reinforcement.
   A boom truck with a cable winch was brought to the shaft opening
and a cage with two rescue workers lowered into the shaft about 10
p.m.
   ``I want to keep all the hope I can,'' said Town Marshal Elmo
Gatlin earlier when asked of the little boy's chances.
   About 40 rescue workers took part in the search under the bright
glare of floodlights in mild weather Friday night.
   Taylor said loose rock and gravel around the mine shaft opening
made it difficult to move the boom truck to the opening and allow
rescuers to be lowered into the mine in a cage.
   Authorities said there were probably 5,000 abandoned mine shafts
in the Central City area, many of them uncovered.
   Taylor said the mine shaft was inside this historic mining
town's city limits but in a residential area away from the
commercial district.

<HEAD>Steinberg Gets Maximum Sentence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joel Steinberg, convicted of killing his
illegally adopted daughter, has been sentenced to the maximum 8 1-3
to 25 years in prison after being described as callous, selfish and
manipulative.
   The disbarred attorney slumped in resignation upon hearing state
Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax issue the sentence for his
manslaughter conviction in the November 1987 death of 6-year-old
Lisa.
   The defendant had spent nearly 20 minutes protesting his
innocence, saying he was guilty only of an ``error in judgment''
for not immediately getting medical help for the child when she
fell unconscious.
   Near tears and almost pleading, Steinberg told Rothwax that he
never hit Lisa and said she received ``constant love.''
   ``Those children were not locked in a house of horror,''
Steinberg said of Lisa and the baby boy he called Mitchell, also
illegally adopted.
   But Assistant District Attorney John McCusker told the court
Lisa's death was a result of Steinberg's ``life of violence,
selfishness and self-gratification at the expense of other people.''
   ``Mr. Steinberg has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing
Elisabeth,'' McCusker said.
   ``I understand the meaning of remorse,'' said Steinberg, who had
not testified at the trial. ``I have remorse about losing my life.
   ``I feel that pain every day. It's my loss. I'm the victim.''
   Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's battered former live-in companion
and the key prosecution witness against him, watched the sentencing
on television at the Manhattan office of her lawyer, Betty
Levinson. She heard Steinberg say Lisa was fine when he left her
with Ms. Nussbaum, 46, and went to dinner with a friend.
   ``He just got up there and lied and she's furious,'' Ms.
Levinson said of Ms. Nussbaum's reaction. ``He was weaving together
this totally untrue and fantastic rendition of what happened.''
   Steinberg, 47, said Lisa received ``constant nurturing, constant
caring, constant love'' and described their life in a Greenwich
Village townhouse where Mark Twain once lived as ``joyous, superb,
delightful.''
   Steinberg denied hitting the child, but said, ``I don't deny
that during the course of administering CPR, OK, I could have
caused some'' injury.
   He dispassionately discussed the technical aspects of Lisa's
bruises more as a lawyer, rather than a defendant.
   Steinberg suddenly stopped and told Rothwax, ``Your honor is
laughing.''
   ``I'm not laughing,'' the judge. ``I'm just astonished.''
   At several points during Steinberg's discussion of Lisa, her
natural mother Michele Launders, and Graceann Smigiel, the boy's
maternal grandmother, wept.
   Steinberg smiled, chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers
offered lengthy presentencing motions, all of which were denied by
Rothwax.
   In a brief preamble to the sentence, Rothwax said Steinberg's
``extraordinary narcissism and self-involvement, his extreme need
to control ... led him to become the instrument of Lisa's death.''
   The judge also fined Steinberg $5,000 and recommended against
parole.
   Steinberg has been held without bail since his arrest Nov. 2,
1987. So he will eligible for parole in seven years, having already
served 16 months of the 8 1-3-year minimum sentence.
   Even without parole, New York's general practice would allow
Steinberg to serve only two-thirds of his maximum _ 16 years and
eight months in this case _ since he can earn one-third of his
sentence off for good behavior.
   Rothwax received hundreds of letters _ from adoptive parents,
childless couples and people abused as children _ urging him to
give Steinberg the maximum term.
   Perry Reich, a attorney for Steinberg, said a notice of appeal
was filed Friday, adding, ``We're very optimistic. It is fair to
say this was just round one.''

   A woman with leprosy gave birth outside
the gates of a Red Cross hospital that had hours earlier turned her
away, an official said today.
   Col. Krishan Gulati said a doctor at the Family Welfare and
Children's Hospital in suburban New Delhi refused Wednesday to
admit the 27-year-old woman for fear her open wounds would infect
its only operating room.
   Gulati, head of the local chapter of the Red Cross Society, said
the woman later that day delivered a girl just outside the hospital.
   Residents of a nearby leper colony demonstrated outside the
hospital Friday to demand action against the doctor who refused to
admit the woman. Gulati said the hospital will no longer refuse
such patients.
   The couple lives near the hospital in Seemapuri, a New Delhi
suburb and the largest leprosy colony in northern India. About
5,000 lepers live there.
   Gulati said the young mother was eventually admitted to a ward
in the 50-bed hospital and discharged Friday.

   The calm waters of Prince William Sound
have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in U.S.
history, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid
chunks of ice, officials said.
   The spill of some 270,000 barrels _ or 11.3 million gallons _
occurred early Friday when the 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez went
hard aground on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles outside Valdez, the
northermost ice-free port in the United States.
   Coast Guard spokesman Ed Wieliczkiewicz said the use of
chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil
failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up
the oil.
   He said Exxon officials plan to pump the oil remaining aboard
the Exxon Valdez onto the Exxon Baton Rouge, another tanker.
   Early Friday the Exxon Valdez was losing 20,000 gallons of oil
per hour, but the flow slowed to a trickle later.
   An oil slick snaked about five miles from the ship as wind and
tide pushed the crude oil into the sound and away from shore.
   ``This is the largest oil spill in U.S. history and it
unfortunately took place in an enclosed water body with numerous
islands, channels, bays and fiords,'' said Richard Golob, publisher
of the Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said the ship was ``impaled on the reef.'' He
said the vessel steered from its course to avoid chunks of ice and
did not return to its normal traffic lane.
   Dan Lawn, an engineer for the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, said the captain could not steer the Exxon Valdez
back on course in time to avoid a collision.
   Lawn likened the ship's situation to ``trying to park a Cadillac
in a Volkswagen spot.''
   Divers were to check the ship's hull and their findings were to
be used in making plans for the removal of crude oil still aboard
the vessel.
   ``A spill of this size in such a complex environment promises to
be a cleanup nightmare,'' said Golob, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
consultant whose firm has studied oil spills and environmental
disasters for 15 years.
   In Washington, Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein
said efforts had begun to evacuate waterfowl, sea otters and other
wildlife from the danger area.
   The Exxon Valdez had loaded 1.2 million barrels of oil at the
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. marine terminal at Valdez and was en
route to Long Beach, Calif., when it crunched onto the reef. The
ship marks the second aniversary of its maiden voyage today.
   The terminal was closed early Friday to tanker traffic as
officials tried to deal with the mammoth spill. The flow in the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline also was reduced to 800,000 barrels daily
from 1.2 million barrels.
   Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan said that, at the reduced rate,
the marine terminal's capacity would allow nine days of operation
before the line would have to be shut down.
   Valdez, a town of about 3,000 year-round residents that grows to
more than 4,000 with a summer influx of fishing industry workers
and travelers, is a picturesque community about 125 miles east of
Anchorage.
   It relies on the fishing, oil and tourism industries. The sound
is considered a playground for kayakers, sport fishermen and
tourists.
   Jason Wells, executive director of the Valdez Fisheries
Development Association, said he believed the oil slick would cause
little damage unless wind pushes it back toward Valdez. The fishing
industry is between seasons.
   Wells said the black cod fishery is scheduled to begin April 1,
but the region's major herring fishery is not expected to get under
way until mid-April.
   But the spill likely will draw increasing fire from
environmentalists sensitive about the trans-Alaska pipeline and
efforts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
development.
   ``It's of concern for two reasons: one is the size of the spill
and that this is such a sensitive, very productive area,'' said
Lisa Speer, senior staff scientist with the Natural Resources
Defense Council in New York.
   Valdez City Manager Doug Griffin said the 800-mile trans-Alaska
pipeline which carries oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez and the
marine terminal have an enviable environmental record. But he added:
   ``Living in Valdez, we've always worried that sometime something
like this could happen.''
   Previously, the largest U.S. tanker spill was the Dec. 15, 1976,
grounding of the Argo Merchant tanker off the Nantucket shoals off
Massachusetts, in which 7.6 million gallons of oil spilled, Golob
said.
   The largest tanker spill in history was in the July 19, 1979,
collision off Tobago of the supertankers Atlantic Empress and
Aegean Captain, in which 300,000 tons _ more than 80 million
gallons _ of oil was lost.

   Following is a list of record oil spills from ships. In
shipping, oil normally is measured by ton. Generally, the amount of
tons can be multiplied by seven to estimate the number of barrels
spilled; each barrel contains 42 gallons. However, the exact number
of barrels in a ton varies according to the type of oil:

   The rock groups Midnight Oil, INXS and
Icehouse gave a concert to 200,000 people that raised $80,000 to
help stop pollution of this city's famed beaches.
   The Turn Back The Tide concert Friday at Bondi Beach also
included Americans Joe Walsh and Christopher Cross and the
Australian bands Rose Tatoo and the Divynls.
   Untreated sewage and high levels of pollution have recently been
detected off several Sydney beaches. Viruses capable of causing
meningitis and myocarditis and fish with high mercury levels have
been discovered off Bondi.
   ``The politicians will learn that they will lose elections if
they continue to pollute the ocean,'' concert organizer Richard
Clugston said.
   Rock singer John Farnham told the crowd he had met with New
South Wales state environmental minister Tim Moore and members of
the Water Board, and ``they told us that the sewage they pumped
into the sea was diluted one part in ten. They expect us to swim in
that ?''
   Sydney disc jockey Jonathon Coleman described the concert as
``Australia's Woodstock against poo (pollution).''

   A powerful bomb strapped on an abandoned
bicycle exploded today in a crowded Indian market, killing at least
one person and injuring six, authorities in the northern state of
Punjab said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but police
blamed Sikh extremists pressing their 7-year campaign for a
separate homeland.
   Police said the bomb went off at a busy intersection in Katra
Jailmal Singh, one of the main markets in the city's old, walled
section. The market also is near the Golden Temple, the Sikhs'
holiest shrine.
   The explosion, heard two miles away, caused widespread damage to
shops and cars, police said.
   Sikhs, whose faith is rooted both in Hinduism and Islam,
outnumber Hindus in Punjab, a rich farming state bordering
Pakistan. But they comprise only 2 percent of the nationwide
population of 880 million. Hindus make up 82 percent of the
country's populace.
   Militant Sikhs launched their separatist campaign in 1982, and
the death toll has escalated each year.
   In 1988, at least 2,400 people were killed by Sikh extremists in
Punjab. At least 457 people have died so far this year.

<HEAD>Lower Court Asked to Reconsider Airline's Request on Pilots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals panel in Florida has ordered a
lower court to reconsider Eastern Airlines' request that pilots be
ordered back to work as a strike against the carrier enters its
fourth week.
   In another development, the trustee of the New York bankruptcy
court hearing the Eastern case, Harry Jones, said Friday he was
conducting a careful search for a bankruptcy examiner.
   The Miami Herald reported in today's editions that Jones said he
was looking for someone U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R.
Lifland ``knows and trusts'' to mediate disputes among Eastern's
management and unions, investigate the airline's sale of Eastern
assets to parent Texas Air Corp. and report back to the judge and
Jones.
   Also Friday, Lifland extended his order that other airlines
honor agreements on ticket, baggage and cargo transfers Eastern
badly needs to keep its few remaining flights in operation; he
barred striking Machinists from picketing on the sidewalk in front
of Eastern's terminal at Boston's Logan International Airport; and
flight attendants at Eastern's sister carrier Continental Airlines
ended a four-day strike that had little apparent effect.
   The developments came on the 21st day of the strike by Eastern's
8,500-member machinists union, which has been honored by most of
the airline's pilots and flight attendants.
   Of Eastern's prestrike daily roster of 1,040 flights, about 10
percent are still running _ all on the airline's Northeast shuttle
and Latin American routes.
   In Tallahassee, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told U.S.
District Judge Edward Davis in Miami to hold new hearings to
determine whether the walkout by Eastern's 3,600 pilots is a
sympathy strike, as the pilots claim _ or a de facto pilots strike
seeking its own aims, as Eastern management contends.
   Eastern had asked the appeals court to overturn Davis' earlier
ruling permitting the Air Line Pilots Association to honor the
machinists' pickets under the Railway Labor Act of 1926.
   ``A claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext to
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the
Railway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.
   The ruling called on Davis to report back to the appeals court
after his hearings on the issue.
   A statement issued by Eastern said that if Davis finds the
pilots union has stayed off the job primarily to pursue its own
bargaining objectives, ``the court would be expected to order them
back to work.''
   The pilots said they were satisfied with the ruling.
   ``The appeals court denied Eastern's request for an immediate
injunction and the lawful pilots sympathy strike shall continue,''
an a pilots' union statement said.
   After cutting fares on its Northeast shuttle service linking
Boston, New York and Washington to as low as $12 to combat the
strike, Eastern on Friday raised ticket prices on those runs to
their original $99 daily and $69 weekend fares.
   In New York, Lifland granted a two-week extension to an order
that competitors honor interline agreements, after Eastern
attorneys said the carrier's few remaining services would be
crippled without cooperation from other airlines.
   Lifland's order barring Eastern machinists' picketing on a
150-yard-long sidewalk in front of Eastern's terminal at Logan
International Airport followed the airline's complaint that
Machinists were trespassing on private property.
   But Lifland also said his court could not _ and would not _ bar
picketing altogether. He said he only wanted to ensure the strikers
remained in authorized areas.
   In Houston, Texas, spokeswoman Myra Clayton of the Union of
Flight Attendants said the union notifed Continental flight
attendants to return to work.
   No flights were disrupted or canceled because of the walkout,
Continental said. The airline claimed only 200 light attendants
took part in the walkout, while the union claimed more than 1,200
of their members struck.
   The 6,000-member union called the walkout Monday to protest what
it said were substandard wages and working conditions.

   Trumpeter Warren Gale has played ``Zip a
Dee Doo Dah'' at least 33,000 times, which adds up to about a
thousand times for each year he worked at Disneyland before
retiring.
   Main Street USA has been Gale's stage, but it's time to slow
down, he said.
   With a bad back, bad feet and a little extra weight, Gale, 68,
said ``marching up and down that street is getting harder every
day.''
   Gale has been part of the ``World Famous Disneyland Band'' since
1955, when Disneyland's Magic Kingdom opened in Orange County. Gale
retired Friday.
   He was one of only a few original employees at the park. And one
of the more accomplished, amusement park officials said.
   ``Warren is one of the finest trumpet players in the world,''
said Dave Warble, Disneyland's head conductor for the past six
years. ``When he plays a solo _ and this is every day, every set _
everyone stops and listens. He has a style uniquely his own; it
can't be duplicated. He is so correct musically and artistically,
we just sit there in awe of him.
   ``He's the E.F. Hutton of the trumpet,'' Warble said. ``When he
plays, people listen.''

   Even with a will, there's no way to inherit
University of Nebraska football season tickets without benefit of
marriage.
   A new university policy permits transfer of season tickets to
spouses or, in the event of death, to surviving spouses.
   The previous policy had allowed season tickets to be passed on
to sons, daughters or other relatives.
   ``The season ticket renewal policy was changed after a long and
careful study of the administration problems caused by the old
policy,'' said Athletic Director Bob Devaney.
   ``We've had plenty of complaints from loyal alums and loyal fans
who were never able to procure season tickets because they were
being handed from generation to generation.
   ``There are too many good people who have been stuck buying
tickets game-by-game and have been waiting a long time to get
season tickets without much hope because there weren't any season
tickets being freed up,'' he said.

   The Marin County Humane Society wants
every pet owner to make sure their dog or cat has a chip on its
shoulder.
   The Society plans to implant microchips into the animals to
serve as electronic nameplates for instant identification.
   Starting in a few weeks, lost, stolen or strayed pets which are
turned in to the county animal shelter will be injected into the
shoulder with a $40 rice grain-sized chip imprinted with the
critter's 10-digit I.D. number.
   With the wave of an electronic wand, Rover's or Fluffy's
numbered codes for names, addresses and telephone numbers show up
on a screen, and the animal is as good as headed home.
   Mary Wright of the society said the scanning device will be run
over the chip which will be imbedded in the animal's shoulder ``and
it makes a little beep _ just like at the check stand. It's very
high tech.''
   Some 2,500 stray pets, mostly dogs and cats, are destroyed each
year at the Marin shelter, and the new system could save at least
some of them, said Wright.

   Pro-choice activists called the leader of an anti-abortion group
``Ayatollah Terry'' as he and his supporters led demonstrations
around the country in a Holy Week campaign that resulted in several
hundred arrests.
   Nearly 300 people were arrested Friday in Philadelphia and
Albany, N.Y. In Long Beach, Calif., police refused to arrest any of
the 350 Operation Rescue protesters at a sit-in outside a medical
building although they defied an order to disperse. Police made no
arrests because the building was closed, said Police Chief Lawrence
Binkley.
   In Philadelphia, 180 people were arrested following
demonstrations at two clinics. The protests came three days after a
federal judge barred all such disruptive demonstrations by abortion
opponents at clinics.
   The demonstrators gathered in rain and gusting winds outside
Planned Parenthood and the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center for
Women, chanting and singing. Only protesters at Planned Parenthood
were arrested.
   Members of abortion-rights groups said they decided to show up
also to press their side.
   ``We knew in advance and we got organized,'' said Marcy McCook,
a worker at Planned Parenthood. ``People are afraid they're going
to lose their rights.''
   Pam Rizzo, president of Northeast Pro-Life, said people ``who
didn't want to see babies die'' showed up to demonstrate, but Good
Friday also gave people added incentive to protest.
   The clinics were opened after minor delays.
   One of the larger gatherings was in Long Beach, where those
opposed to legalized abortion held Bibles and photos of aborted
fetuses and sang hymns.
   More than 400 pro-choice activists, including actress Morgan
Fairchild and comedian Elayne Boosler, toted signs and chanted
slogans like ``Read 'em their rights and take them away.''
   Randall Terry, leader of the Binghamton, N.Y.-based Operation
Rescue, was reluctant to answer reporter's questions as pro-choice
demonstrators surrounded him yelling ``Ayatollah Terry.''
   ``I'm not talking because this is not a war of words, it's a war
against butchering babies,'' Terry said.
   ``They say you don't have a permit to be here, but the Bible is
the best permit you can have,'' Terry told his followers.
   Following the Long Beach protest, the administrative offices of
Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles received a bomb threat, prompting
an evacuation and police search that found no evidence of any
explosive device, said executive director Joan Babbott.
   In New York, anti-abortion protesters in Albany and Syracuse
were carted to jail in wheelchairs and converted passenger buses.
   In Albany, police said more than 115 people were arrested in a
demonstration that began shortly after dawn at the downtown office
of Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood.
   While the Albany demonstrators refused to say whether they were
part of Operation Rescue, some sported ``O.R.'' armbands and
Operation Rescue sweatshirts.
   With banners and signs that read, ``Abortion, The Ultimate Child
Abuse,'' ``Baby Humans Slaughtered Here'' and ``Hitler Would be
Proud of Planned Parenthood,'' the protesters sang religious songs,
prayed and picketed. Some sat and locked arms.
   Most of those arrested went limp, forcing police officers to
carry or drag them into waiting vans and a large bus.
   In Syracuse, police used wheelchairs to haul away 56 protesters
who packed inside the Planned Parenthood Center while about 100 of
their fellow demonstrators picketed outside in a cold drizzle.

   A 2-year-old boy wandered away from
his home in this historic silver mining town and fell to his death
in a nearby abandoned mine shaft, authorities said.
   Gilpin County Coroner Dick Allen said the child, identified as
Michael Mills, apparently was killed instantly from massive head
injuries.
   John Rittenhouse, search coordinator for the Gilpin County
Search and Rescue Team, said the boy's body was found Friday night
about 150 to 200 feet down the shaft, lodged among timbers and
rocks. He said the shaft went far below that point.
   Central City, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains about 30
miles west of Denver, was a silver mining boom town from the
mid-1800s till the turn of the century.
   Authorities said probably 5,000 abandoned mine shafts are in the
area, many of them uncovered.
   The boy had been playing in his yard with his older sister, whom
Rittenhouse described as being in her 20s.
   ``There was a phone call and when she came back out he was gone.
We were called out about 2:45 p.m. ... We followed his tracks up to
an abandoned mine shaft that's maybe 100 yards behind his house and
found an area that something apparently had slid down into the mine
shaft,'' Rittenhouse said.
   The mine rescue unit was then called out and an access road had
to be bulldozed about 100 yards up a hill to the shaft site, he
said.
   A special boom truck rigged with cable winch and an enclosed
cage was brought to the mouth of the shaft.
   Two men were lowered in the cage about 10 p.m.
   ``We got down about 50 feet with the cage and the shaft narrowed
to the point the cage wouldn't go any furthur,'' Rittenhouse said.
``At that point we pulled it up and hooked a smaller ore bucket to
our boom truck and lowered it down with two men in it. We were able
to get down to the boy.''
   The boy's body was found about 10:40 p.m., Rittenhouse said.
   About 30 rescue workers participated in the search under the
bright glare of floodlights in mild weather.

   The Coast Guard and Navy have called off
their search for a 52-foot sport fishing yacht with 10 people on
board, and authorities said they have not ruled out a possible hoax.
   Coast Guard radio operators monitored a distress call about 9:30
p.m. Thursday in which the caller said the boat was foundering in
heavy seas 5 miles off of Virginia Beach.
   Two minutes later, a second and final transmission from the boat
Blue Goose stated that the vessel was sinking and all aboard had
donned life vests and were entering the water. Coast Guard attempts
to call the vessel got no response.
   ``We completely scoured the area, covered it countless times,''
said Lt. j.g. Carlyle A. Blomme, commander of the Coast Guard
cutter Point Huron.
   The 20-hour search was suspended Friday evening.
   ``We didn't find anything; no coolers, no nothing, just lots of
fog,'' Blomme said. ``Due to the lack of evidence, we can't rule
out a hoax. But when lives are concerned, we have to search.''
   Norfolk's regional office of the Federal Communications
Commission was ``watching the case to determine whether this is a
possible hoax,'' said J.J. Freeman, the FCC's engineer in charge.
``We're already in contact with the Coast Guard. They must treat
every call as a bonified emergency.''
   Broadcast of a fraudulent mayday is a federal offense and
carries a maximum penalty of a $100,000 fine and one year in
prison, according to federal officials.
   Three Coast Guard cutters, a helicopter and two Navy ships
searched for the vessel Friday in seas that rose to 10 to 12 feet
and in dense fog that sometimes produced zero visibility.
   Vessels criss-crossed an 85-square-mile area, parts of it three
and four times, Coast Guard Lt. Walter T. Hunnings said.
   The Coast Guard also ran computer checks on all registered
vessels with the name Blue Goose. But of the 35 or so with that
name on the Atlantic Coast, none matched the length and make of the
craft described in the distress call.

<HEAD>Sudanese Emergency Relief Effort To Begin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An emergency relief effort to help
the hundreds of thousands of people facing starvation in southern
Sudan can begin now that rebels have pledged their support, a U.N.
official said today.
   Richard S. Reid, regional director of the U.N. Children's Fund
for the Middle East and North Africa, said ``Operation Lifeline''
will be ``the biggest emergency relief operation of its kind in the
world.''
   U.N. officials announced Thursday at the United Nations that the
rebels agreed to back the aid program, marking a breakthrough in
protracted negotiations with the Sudan government and the
insurgents to protect relief workers from rebel attacks.
   Reid said today that rebel leaders ``are now impatient'' for the
relief effort to begin. He said they ``strongly and emphatically''
support it.
   ``It is time for the United Nations and the relief donor
governments and agencies to start the relief action, to couple
words with deeds,'' Reid said.
   He said he hoped ``to show results not later than April 1.''
   In Washington on Friday, the U.S. official in charge of foreign
disaster relief called on nations around the world to ``put the
cash down'' and help southern Sudan.
   Julia Taft, director of the State Department's Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance, said unless the U.N.-sponsored emergency
relief program succeeds, hundreds of thousands of Sudanese could
die.
   She said the relief program will cost an estimated $132 million,
with $55 million of that amount still to be raised.
   Reid flew Friday from Amman, Jordan, to Addis Ababa, where he
met officials of the Sudan People's Liberation Army. They have
fought a six-year civil war to gain more autonomy for the mostly
Christian and animist south from the mainly Moslem north, which
controls the government.
   The United Nations earlier urged the rebels to accept a
six-month ceasefire offered by the government, but they rejected
the proposal.
   As an alternative, the United Nations proposed both sides in the
civil war agree to safeguard ``emergency (relief) corridors'' for
at least one month.
   Under the plan, the United Nations with donor governments and
agencies plans to transport about 100,000 metric tons of food,
medicine and other relief supplies to southern Sudan before heavy
summer rains begin in May.
   A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 pounds.
   The supplies are to be transported through eight corridors on
barges, trucks, railroads and airplanes. They will move from
Sudan's capital, Khartoum, and from neighboring Ethiopia, Uganda
and Kenya.
   Reid said the relief must be delivered before the rainy season
``if we are to avoid the catastrophe of last year, in which an
estimated 250,000 people died.''
   The rainy season makes surface transport virtually impossible
and air transport difficult between May and November.
   Reid said the Sudanese government and the rebels would assist in
distributing the aid.
   He said the relief operation will be about the same size as a
major drought relief drive in Ethiopia in 1987-88. But he said the
Sudan effort will be carried out in a shorter time.

<TEXT>
   Christian army units fought all-night
artillery and rocket battles with Syrian army gunners and allied
Druse militiamen in the Beirut area. Police today reported six
people killed and 31 wounded.
   The new casualties raised the toll to 87 people killed and 284
wounded since March 8, when clashes broke out between Gen. Michel
Aoun's Christian troops and militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party. Syrian troops earlier this
week joined Jumblatt's forces in battles.
   Aoun also leads a Christian Cabinet that rivals a Moslem
government for control of this divided nation, which has endured 14
years of civil war.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said the new casualties were civilians. The spokesman said
no Christian soldiers were injured, and he knew nothing of any
casualties on the other side.
   The independent daily newspaper An-Nahar, published in
Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut, said Aoun's gunners, operating
U.S.-designed 155mm howitzers, scored direct hits on Syrian army
positions in seven towns and villages around Beirut. It gave no
casualty figures.
   Syrian army gunners pounded Christian towns northeast of Beirut
with 107mm Soviet-designed Grad rockets from multi-barrelled
launchers deployed along mountains south and east of the capital.
   The barrage several times reached as high as 80 rounds a minute
before the artillery duel tapered off into sporadic exchanges at
daybreak, the police spokesman said.
   Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon, keeps 40,000 troops in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the civil war.
   Flashes from artillery explosions cut the darkness as the thuds
of bombardment shook Beirut and surrounding areas.
   The clashes have followed a pattern of massive nighttime
shelling followed by daytime lulls, apparently to give people a
chance to buy food and other supplies.
   Denise Khater, an executive secretary in the Christian suburb of
Baabda, said:``It was raining rockets at Baabda. Several times I
thought the building would collapse on the basement where we were
hiding.''
   Bank employee Elie Badran said Christian east Beirut's densely
populated Ashrafiyeh district also came under ferocious bombardment
overnight but that most people had taken refuge in basements and
bomb shelters before dusk.
   ``We've installed a television set in the basement of our
building. We also have beds, mattresses and blankets in addition to
a variety of medicines, first aid equipment and water supply,'' he
said.
   The artillery duel escalated sharply Friday evening after Aoun
rejected a truce with the Syrian and Jumblatt's forces and vowed to
drive the Syrian army out of Lebanon even if the fighting destroys
Beirut.
   The confrontation broke out earlier this month after Aoun
decided to blockade illegal militia-run ports along Lebanon's
coast. The militias have been skimming tax revenues the government
would otherwise collect there.

   A woman who claims she shot her
82-year-old mother eight times in the head and neck in a
``homicidal compulsion'' induced by the drug Halcion has filed a
$21 million federal lawsuit against Upjohn Corp.
   Ilo Marie Grundberg says she was suffering a severe case of
``Halcion intoxication'' when she shot and killed Mildred Coats on
June 19, 1988, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District
Court on Friday.
   Grundberg, who once shared a home with her mother in the
southern Utah city of Hurricane, faced a second-degree murder
charge until a judge dismissed the case, ruling the killing was the
result of her addiction to the prescription drug used in treating
insomnia.
   Grundberg is joined in the lawsuit by her daughter, Janice Gray,
who both now live in Yucaipa, Calif. Gray represents Coats' estate.
   The lawsuit contends that Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Mich., knew or
should have known that Halcion, known generically as triazolam,
could cause intoxication in the user even when properly prescribed
and used ``according to the advice and directions supplied by the
defendant.''
   Among the possible reactions, the lawsuit claims, are ``severe
depression, hallucinations, psychosis, organic brain damage,
bizarre and profoundly disturbed behavior, amnesia'' and other side
effects which, ``if not promptly discovered and treated, can lead
to personal injury and death to the user and others in contact with
the user.''
   Upjohn spokeswoman Nancy Heitzman declined to discuss the
lawsuit Friday, saying company policy prohibited comment on pending
litigation.
   Grundberg, 57, admitted that on the night of her mother's death,
she slipped a birthday card into the sleeping woman's hand _ the
next day was her 83rd birthday _ then shot her with a .22-caliber
revolver.
   She then wrote a confession saying she loved her mother, but
killed her to spare her from what she described as troubled
financial times ahead. She then called police.
   An investigation, however, revealed the women were well off
financially and that Coats had signed over all her assets to
Grundberg. Police said they had no motive for the shooting.

<HEAD>Two People a Day Died in Drug-Related Slayings, Stats Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two people a day were killed last year in
drug-related slayings in the nation's largest city, making up
almost 37 percent of the record 1,896 homicides, police said.
   In addition, the epidemic of crack, a powerful form of cocaine,
was responsible for 1988's record rate of aggravated assaults,
larceny and motor vehicle thefts, police said.
   ``I think we have to attribute a significant portion of all
these increases to crack,'' said Assistant Chief Raymond Kelly of
the department's Office of Management Analysis and Planning. ``It's
sweeping the country. It's been here since 1986, that's when the
figures started going up dramatically.''
   Officials had acknowledged in December that 1988 was the city's
most murderous year, topping the old record of 1,826 people set in
1981.
   The figures were released Friday.
   In 1988, 36.8 percent of all the homicides committed in the city
were drug related, Kelly said. ``And those are only the ones we are
definitely sure of. I'm sure there's more.''
   Homicides and non-negligent manslaughters topped the list of
crimes against people, increasing 13.4 percent in a year from 1,672
to 1,896.
   The only decline in crime came in the number of reported rapes,
which dropped 2.7 percent from 3,507 in 1987 to 3,412 in 1988.
   Department statisticians do not view that as a significant
decrease because ``generally speaking rape (cases) are
underreported,'' Kelly said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe will curtail a
visit to Pakistan for fear of fueling more Moslem protests over
Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' British officials
said today.
   Plans for Howe to visit Afghan rebel leaders in the border town
of Peshawar have been scrapped, British officials said. He will
leave Sunday and remain in the capital, Islamabad, for two days
before going to India on a four-day visit.
   Howe added a stop in Madras, India, for the time that he was to
spend in Pakistan.
   ``There is no point in precipitating demonstrations (in
Pakistan),'' said a British official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Howe is also due to stop for talks in Bahrain and Qatar en route
home.
   The foreign secretary is the most senior British official to
visit an Islamic country since Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini urged
Moslems to kill Rushdie, A native of Bombay and now a naturalized
British citizen. Many Moslems believe Rushdie's novel blasphemes
their religion.
   Khomeini's Feb. 14 death sentence prompted Britain and Iran to
cut diplomatic ties and chilled relations between Western and
Islamic countries. It also sent Rushdie into hiding.
   Moslems around the world have protested the novel. Some of the
most serious demonstrations have broken out in Pakistan and India,
where at least 19 people have died.
   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, elected last year, has
accused Islamic fundamentalist opponents of using ``The Satanic
Verses'' issue as a cover to foment protests against her government.
   British officials say the visit to Pakistan was planned to
express support for Pakistan's recent democratic elections and for
the help Pakistan gives Afghan rebels.
   Howe has scheduled meetings with Ms. Bhutto in Islamabad and
with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in New Delhi.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phone-sex is safe sex, says a group that
promotes education about AIDS.
   ``In the age of AIDS, we need to make sure people have access to
forms of sexual expression which are completely safe,'' said
Benjamin Schatz of the National Gay Rights Advocates. ``We can't
allow conservative moralizing to take precedence over people's
lives.''
   Schatz's group has prepared a brief for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation to be filed today with the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The court is reviewing a Federal Communications Commission
proposal to ban obscene or ``indecent'' commercial messages in
telephone calls on interstate lines or in the District of Columbia.
The calls are carried, for a fee, on numbers beginning with 900
prefixes.
   ``There is direct evidence that some people consciously use
`dial-a-porn' as a form of `safe sex' instead of engaging in sexual
contact involving the exchange of bodily fluids,'' the foundation
said in the papers.
   Records of the foundation's safe-sex workshops with homosexual
men reveal that participants named ``phone sex'' as a safe-sex
substitute in every recorded session.
   Schatz acknowledged that telephone sex does not always prevent
unsafe sex, and can even encourage it, but said the beneficial
effects outweigh any justification for a ban.
   ``It would be naive to say that this is something everybody
responds to in a socially responsible manner,'' he said. ``But
watching television can encourage unsafe sex, and that's no reason
to ban television.''
   The AIDS foundation, a non-profit educational and service
organization, argued in its Supreme Court brief that even obscene
phone messages that might otherwise be banned should be
constitutionally protected ``to the extent that they may divert
some individuals from life-threatening behavior.''
   ``Look at gay newspapers. You will find pages of ads for phone
sex lines, where years ago the ads would have been for
bathhouses,'' Schatz said Friday.
   The bathhouses, which have been shut down in San Francisco, were
viewed by health officials as major sources of transmission of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in anonymous sexual contacts
between male homosexuals.
   AIDS, an affliction in which a virus attacks the body's immune
system, leaves victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers. It is most often transmitted through sexual contact,
mostly between homosexual males.
   The brief argued that telephone sex not only serves as an
alternative to sexual contacts that can transmit AIDS, but also can
serve as a form of education to make safe sex more attractive.
   A study presented by U.S. public health researchers at a recent
international conference on AIDS in Stockholm found that ``sexually
explicit materials presenting safer sex behavior in an
affirmatively erotic manner was the most sucessful means of
motivating persons to change from high-risk to low- or no-risk
behavior,'' said the brief, signed by Schatz and lead attorney
Leonard Graff.
   Heterosexual as well as homosexual phone mssages should be
allowed because both groups can get AIDS from sexual contacts,
Schatz said.
   He said the foundation has no objection to regulation of
``dial-a-porn,'' such as blocking of the service by individual
households or restrictions on access to children.

Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio talk-show listeners from black and white
audiences are getting a chance to sound off together on special
programs aimed at easing racial tensions before Chicago's upcoming
mayoral election.
   WBBM-AM, a 50,000-watt station with a 75 percent white audience,
plans to join with WGCI-AM, a 5,000-watt station with a mostly
black audience, to broadcast a four-hour call-in talk show April 3,
on the eve of the election.
   ``Chicago is a very segregated city, and in many cases,
Chicago's radio stations are also segregated,'' said Chris Berry,
executive editor of WBBM, the all-news AM station that came up with
the idea.
   ``Race has been part of the campaign, in that we have had some
white and some black candidates running,'' he added Friday. ``It
looked to us as though voting would probably go along racial
lines.''
   The candidates are Democratic front-runner Richard M. Daley,
Republican Edward Vrdolyak, and Alderman Timothy Evans, a Democrat
running on a third-party slate. Daley and Vrdolyak are white. Evans
is black.
   Voting in the Feb. 28 mayoral primary was divided largely along
racial lines when Daley defeated Mayor Eugene Sawyer for the
Democratic nomination, becoming the first white candidate to defeat
a black incumbent mayor in a major U.S. city.
   Chicago's voting-age population is about 49 percent white, 42
percent black, 7 percent Hispanic and the remainder Asian and other
groups.
   After the WBBM-WGCI plan was announced two weeks ago, two other
stations joined for a similar program that aired Wednesday.
   Black-oriented WVON-AM teamed with public station WBEZ-FM for a
morning show on politics, social life and race, and agreed to do it
again the day after the election.
   ``I don't think we got into anything all that controversial,''
WBEZ announcer Ken Davis said of Wednesday's program. ``We were all
on our best behavior.''
   WBEZ's audience is 92 percent white and WVON's is 89 percent
black, according to the Chicago Tribune, and their combined show
reached an estimated 450,000 listeners.
   For the election-eve show produced by WBBM-WGCI, the candidates
themselves have been invited. Daley is expected to send a
representative, and Vrdolyak and Evans are expected to participate,
Berry said.
   Also, about 50 business and community leaders are being invited
to sit in as a studio audience and be potential participants, Berry
said.
   ``This is an opportunity for our listeners and their listeners
to talk with people they might not normally have the opportunity to
talk with and to discuss the issues facing this city,'' Berry added.
   Darlene Black, marketing director for WGCI, said: ``It's a
landmark thing to happen for two stations who are normally
competitors to come together for a common cause, but that's really
our main goal.''
   Ms. Black said the mayoral race ``has come down in some areas to
a black-white issue, and that's one of the things we're trying to
eliminate.''
   No estimate was available on WGCI's usual number of listeners,
but WBBM has a usual evening audience of 387,000 adults in the 18
counties surrounding Chicago, said spokeswoman Barbara DiGuido.

   The FBI has recovered art objects worth $3.5
million that were from stolen from museums in five states.
   The pieces, ranging from a $2 million, 14th-century Chinese vase
to 16 antique pocketwatches worth $150,000, were displayed Friday.
   The 25 works were taken between Jan. 12 and Feb. 25 from museums
in Syracuse and Albany, N.Y., Boston, Baltimore, Detroit and
Columbus, Ohio.
   Most of the works were taken when the museums were open to the
public, said James Fox, head of the FBI's New York office.
   A five-count federal indictment charged George A. Athanasotos,
34, and Ronald Corteselli, 28, both of New York City, with
transporting the antiques across state lines and selling them.
   They pleaded innocent Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Kathleen
Roberts, who ordered them held without bail.
   Athanasotos also was charged with interstate transportation of a
$50,000 silver Tiffany pitcher stolen from the Detroit Institute of
Art on Jan. 12.

<TEXT>
   The heads of Egypt, Jordan and the PLO
met today to coordinate a Middle East peace strategy in preparation
for April and May talks in Washington between regional leaders and
President Bush.
   Today's meeting in this Suez Canal city brought together
Jordan's King Hussein, Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt for their
second summit in five months. They last met at Aqaba, Jordan, on
Oct. 22.
   The three are key players in the Arab drive to initiate peace
talks with Israel, primarily with U.S. help.
   Egyptian officials said the meeting came amid ``encouraging
developments'' that may augur well for the peace process.
   One development, said the officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity, was Wednesday's meeting in Tunisia between U.S. and PLO
representatives. No breakthrough was announced there, but the
parties began to discuss substantive issues for the first time
since the dialogue began last December.
   The officials also cited remarks by Bush in a Washington Times
interview Friday in which he praised the dialogue with the PLO and
said he would try to convince Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
next month that ``something good might come'' from this.
   Shamir has refused to speak to the PLO, saying it is a terrorist
group.
   Bush is to meet in Washington with Mubarak on April 3, Shamir on
April 6 and King Hussein on May 2.
   The Egyptian officials said their summit was primarily intended
to build an Arab consensus on ways of advancing peace efforts. They
said the ideas would be taken up with Bush.
   They said a major aim is to persuade the United States and
Israel to back a proposed international conference as an umbrella
for Arab-Israeli negotiations. Inter-Arab consultations will
continue next week, with talks between Mubarak and King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia. Fahd is to arrive in Cairo on Monday for a four-day
official visit.

   The government has banned men from working
in women's health clubs ``in order to protect morality and women's
modesty,'' the ruling party's newspaper reported today.
   ``The practice of men helping women slim down contradicts our
educational course in building the new society and our traditional
values,'' the Baath party paper, Al-Thawra, quoted an Interior
Ministry spokesman as saying.
   The ministry, which ordered the ban, told women's clubs to fire
their male staff immediately, the report said.
   The government last year banned men from working in women's
hairdressing salons for similar reasons.
   Iraq is an Islamic country, but women are officially equal with
men and enjoy more social freedom than in many other Moslem nations.

   Lawmakers hurled microphones, files and
wooden desks at each other today in a free-for-all in a southern
state legislature, a news agency said. At least eight members were
reported injured.
   Members of the governing and opposition parties fought for more
than 15 minutes in the state assembly in Madras, Press Trust of
India reported.
   The news agency said the fight started when Chief Minister
Muthuvel Karunanidhi, the highest official in Tamil Nadu state,
rose to present the budget and an opposition member tried to snatch
papers in his hand. The chief minister's supporters ran to his aid,
PTI said.
   Other lawmakers picked up their desks and threw them at one
another and shouted ``unprintable words,'' PTI said.
   Karunanidhi sustained bruises on his arms and broke his glasses
during the melee, which occurred on the first day of the new
session.
   PTI said seven other members, including Jayalalitha Jayaram,
leader of the opposition All India Anna Dravid Munnetra Kazagham
Party, were hospitalized.
   Members of the opposition party and the governing Dravida
Munnetra Kazagham Party threw microphones, budget files and
sand-filled paper weights, hitting fans, lights and a chandelier in
the assembly hall, PTI said. The chairman adjourned the session
after security men failed to restore order, it said.
   Later, 28 members of the opposition party, including Ms.
Jayaram, were suspended from the house until Friday, PTI said.
   Ms. Jayaram claimed that governing party legislators ``tried to
crack my skull and kill me on the spot,'' according to PTI.
   Karunanidhi, who claimed he was slapped on the face by an
opposition lawmaker, said his supporters simply acted to defend
him, PTI said.

   Radical students set several policemen
afire when they hurled firebombs and rocks in a riot today after
forming a new student alliance to try to oust President Roh
Tae-woo's embattled government.
   Police officials had no figures on injuries after 800 students
fought riot police at Yonsei University in Seoul. No arrests were
reported.
   A rival pro-government rally at Seoul Municipal Stadium today
attracted 40,000 people who urged Roh to suppress leftist groups,
according to Yonhap state news agency. The rally was organized by
conservative groups representing people who fled communist North
Korea after World War II.
   Most Koreans do not support radical students, who before the
riot denounced Roh and called for a joint struggle by students,
workers and farmers to topple the government. Student leaders
criticized the United States for backing Roh.
   ``Unite and overthrow the Roh Tae-woo regime,'' masked students
chanted as they pelted police with firebombs that exploded in
bursts of blazing gasoline and flying glass.
   Student representatives from 37 universities and colleges in
Seoul met at Yonsei to inaugurate the ``Student Struggle
Headquarters for the Overthrow of the Roh Regime.'' Similar groups
will be formed in other parts of the nation, student leaders said.
   About 4,000 riot police surrounded the sprawling campus in
eastern Seoul, firing tear gas and hurling rocks at the attacking
students. Police in armored vans fired salvos of choking tear gas,
and troopers made several charges to drive the students back during
about 90 minutes of fighting.
   During their rally, the radical leaders also denounced Roh for
his March 20 decision to postpone indefinitely a promised
referendum on his performance. Speakers said the action of Roh, an
elected president, proved he was not committed to genuine
democracy, and they called him a military dictator.
   Roh cited the threat of radical protests when he called off the
referendum.
   Speakers also demanded the immediate withdrawal of the 43,000
U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   The radical students and allied dissident groups have little
public support, and most South Koreans reject their militancy.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed two
Palestinian protesters today, and authorities discovered the bodies
of two Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel, according to
Israeli and Arab reports.
   At least 29 Palestinians were wounded or injured in the
bloodiest confrontations this week with Israeli soldiers in the
occupied territories.
   The four deaths raised to 411 the number of Palestinians who
have been killed in the 15-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.
Eighteen Israelis also have died in the rebellion.
   Ashraf Abu Jazar, 17, died on the operating table at Nasser
Hospital in Khan Yunis after being shot in the abdomen during a
protest during which Palestinians threw stones at soldiers in
Rafah, the Arab reports said.
   The other Palestinian killed today was Adli Erbea, 22, who was
reported shot through the heart during a similar riot in Khan Yunis.
   The wounded included a 27-year-old woman struck by a bullet in
the right leg and a 12-year-old boy hit in the left thigh, Arab
hospital officials said.
   Also wounded seriously was an 18-year-old Palestinian from
Tarkumiya near the West Bank town of Hebron. He was rushed to Ahli
Hospital in Hebron with a plastic bullet wound in the chest, the
reports said.
   Witnesses said the clash in Tarkumiya came as more than 500
Palestinians marched to a cemetery carrying an outlawed Palestinian
flag and wreaths of carnations to commemorate the death a year ago
of two 18-year-old Palestinians in the town during a clash with
Israeli troops.
   Two protesters masked with kaffiyeh headdresses carried a large
white banner that said, ``We will avenge their deaths,'' and signed
in Arabic by the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, the
witnesses said.
   The beaten and stabbed body of Jamal Abdel Hamid el Nadi was
found behind a girls' school in Gaza City's Rimal Quarter.
   Israel radio quoted Palestinian sources in Gaza as saying he was
slain because he was suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   The radio said the second dead man, Subhi Hamdan Elsoufi, 21,
whose body was discovered burned and beaten in Rafah, also was a
suspected collaborator.
   The army said both men were killed for criminal reasons and
declined to elaborate. Since the start of the uprising, Arabs have
killed more than 60 Palestinians they accuse of helping Israeli
authorities.

<HEAD>Customs Officials Ordered To Halt Previously OK'd Assault Rifle Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs officials have been ordered to
halt previously approved shipments of more than 400,000
military-style assault weapons at the nation's borders, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms had already approved the weapons shipments, but quickly
rescinded that approval Friday, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   The order follows the Bush administration's announcement earlier
this month that it was issuing a temporary ban on new permits
allowing the importation of five types of assault weapons into the
United States.
   Among those banned was the AK-47, the weapon used earlier this
year in a massacre of schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif.
   William T. Drake, a top official at ATF, acknowledged in an
interview with the Times that the move to ban previously approved
weapons shipments would be controversial. But he said an internal
audit detailing the vast extent of imports already authorized had
persuaded the agency to take the emergency action.
   When the moratorium on new permits was announced earlier this
month federal officials indicated they had no control over permits
already approved.
   However, Drake said his agency believes it was granted that
power under the 1968 Gun Control Act, which empowered the AFT to
grant licenses authorizing gun imports.
   ``What God giveth, God can taketh away,'' he said.
   The bureau declined to disclose how many weapons have been
approved for import, but an unidentified customs source told the
Times the number was 420,000.
   According to the ATF, 70,000 assault rifles have been imported
into the U.S. in the last three years.

   A fiber-optic cable used by AT&amp;T for
trans-Atlantic phone calls failed early today, but service was
restored via satellite, the company reported.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the branch of the TAT-8 cable to
Britain failed about 12:50 a.m. EST.
   The cable splits into two branches as it approaches Europe, with
one going to Britain and the other to France. The French link
failed last Tuesday, and the traffic it normally carries had been
rerouted onto the British leg.
   Linnen said AT&amp;T phone service to Europe was disrupted in the
early morning hours, but was restored by mid-morning via the
Intelsat communications satellite.
   The fiber-optic cable can handle up to 40,000 phone calls
simultaneously, Linnen said. He said AT&amp;T knew the general location
of the failure but did not immediately know the reason.
   ``You have to send a cable ship out and they have to go out
where the fault is, and they just pull it up on board,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Police used tear gas and truncheons
today to disperse thousands of stone-throwing ethnic Albanians
protesting constitutional changes that limit their autonomy in
southern Kosovo province, reports said.
   In the third straight day of demonstrations, up to 4,000
protesters clashed with police armed with machine guns and rifles
on the outskirts of Urosevac, 15 miles south of Pristina, the state
Tanjug news agency reported.
   Earlier today, about 300 Albanians hurled rocks at riot police
and troops gathered around army transport trucks in downtown
Urosevac.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries in either
protest.
   Albanians are protesting the provincial Parliament's approval
Thursday of constitutional amendments giving leaders from the
neighoring republic of Serbia more power in Kosovo.
   The amendments go into effect Tuesday after approval by the
Parliament in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics.
They give Serbia more power over police and judicial authorities
and allow the republic to pass amendments affecting Kosovo without
approval of the provincial parliament.
   Leaders of mainly Christian Serbia said they needed more control
over Kosovo to protect the Serbian minority from the mainly Moslem
ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of Kosovo.
   The vote by the provincial legislature prompted protest rallies
Thursday and Friday by up to 10,000 people. The protests have
violated a ban on all public gatherings ordered last month.
   At least 10 policemen have been injured and more that 100
demonstrators arrested since protests began Thursday. Most arrested
protesters were immediately convicted of ``petty crime'' and
sentenced to between 30 and 60 days in jail, the government's
Tanjug news agency said.
   Twenty-five ethnic Albanian miners and 40 factory workers were
also sentenced to 60 days in prison for defying a recently
introduced ``compulsory work order'' to prevent a proposed general
strike, the news agency said.

<TEXT>
   Widespread poaching has reduced the
African elephant population by more than one-third during the
1980s, from 1.2 million to less than 800,000, a conservation group
said.
   The Kalahari Conservation Society said in its monthly newletter
that Botswana was the only African country to report a substantial
increase in its elephant population during from 1981 to 1987.
   The number of elephants in Botswana rose from 20,000 to 51,000
during the seven years, the newsletter said.
   Overall, the African elephant population fell from 1.2 million
in 1981 to 764,000 by 1987, the group said. The decline was
attributed almost completely to the poaching of elephants for their
valuable ivory tusks, the newsletter said.
   The Botswana-based conservation society said the figures came
from the African Elephant Conservation Coordinating Group, which
was assisted by the Swiss-based Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species.

   Authorities rounded up 200 drug addicts
in the Iranian capital Saturday and said the addicts will be sent
to labor camps in southeast Iran, state-run Tehran radio reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted an unidentified police
official as saying the addicts will build barricades in
Sistan-Baluchistan province intended to prevent narcotics smugglers
from entering Iran.
   The addicts will be kept in the camps from six months to a year
and will be compensated for their labor, the official was quoted as
saying. He gave no details.
   More than 350 drug smugglers have been executed and several
thousand addicts rounded up under a new anti-narcotics law that
took effect Jan. 21.
   The new law carries the death sentence for possession of even
small quantities of drugs and gives addicts six months to kick the
habit or face jail terms.
   Iran's official media estimate there are 1 million drug addicts
in Iran, which has a population of 50 million. Unofficial estimates
put the figure at 2 million.

   Tales to enchant children with titles such
as ``The White Pigeon'' or ``Locusts in The City'' line the shelves
of Middle Eastern classrooms and homes.
   Behind their shiny covers and bright pictures lie subtle
messages of nationhood, homeland and a people's yearning _ the
messages of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   These books and others published by Dar Al-Fata Al-Arabi, the
Arab Youth House, repeatedly drive home the proclaimed PLO
philosophy on what young Palestinians should be taught: ``Hope,
ambition and persistence for independence ... during the struggle
against Zionism and imperialism.''
   The chairman of the Cairo-based publishing house, Nabil Shaath,
is an aide to PLO chief Yasser Arafat and a member of the Palestine
National Council. He and 19 other wealthy Palestinians started Dar
Al-Fata in 1974 with $100,000.
   But Hasna Mekdashi, the company's executive manager, denies the
organization still influences Dar Al-Fata. The house was guided by
the PLO's educational planning department at first, she said, but
it is now independent. ``Our themes are really about universal
values,'' Mrs. Mekdashi said, noting that many of the little books
have been translated into English and other languages.
   Nevertheless, the message remains.
   In ``The White Pigeon'' by Syrian writer Zakaria Tamer, Little
Pigeon ventures out of the nest to discover the world, gets lost
but eventually makes her way home.
   After chiding her daughter for leaving, Mama Pigeon recalls that
she did the same thing as a chick but that her love of home guided
her back. She marvels, in a commentary on the Palestinian diaspora:
``All those who are lost and far away from their homes will be
guided back to them by their love for their homes.''
   And the message changes with PLO policy shifts.
   Although the PLO recently has taken a conciliatory posture in
its conflict with Israel and says it wants a political solution to
the Middle East crisis, early Dar Al-Fata publications had a
militant flavor to them.
   ``The Home,'' a brightly colored 1974 pamphlet, depicts the
dwellings of birds, animals and fish.
   Then, beside a picture of a tank with a Star of David on its
side, it says the residence of the Palestinian is occupied by the
enemy. Next is a rifle dominating an orange-colored page, and
author Tamer concludes: ``How will the Palestinian regain his home?
With arms alone.''
   The publication was distributed at the United Nations when
Arafat spoke to the General Assembly in 1975, Mrs. Mekdashi said.
   Shaath said in an interview that the booklet was written 15
years ago but said if it were written today, ``We would say by arms
and persuasion.''
   He laughed. ``Now I would say more persuasion than arms.''
   Shaath planned Dar Al-Fata soon after a dispute between
Palestinians in Jordan and King Hussein deteriorated into war in
September 1970. Hussein's army drove out Arafat and the PLO's
guerrilla forces.
   Soon, the publishing house had another experience with Arab
schisms. It had to move its headquarters from Beirut to Cairo in
1976 when civil war broke out, although its main printing
facilities remain in the battered Lebanese capital.
   Of the house's 260 books and posters, 12 are translated into
English, four into Swedish and a few into French, Spanish and
German. The translated works serve mainly ethnic Arab communities
in the United States, Britain, France and Australia, giving them a
taste of their ancestors' culture.
   The publishing house has not shirked from criticizing Arab
divisions and rhetoric.
   Plant-devouring insects swarm into a town in ``Locusts in the
City.'' Instead of attending to the business of eliminating the
pests, residents spend their time talking about the problem and
making eloquent speeches critical of the insects. The book
concludes: ``When the locusts occupied the city, they did not leave
it. They are still eating the grass, the ears of wheat and the
leaves of the trees.''
   In ``The House of White Paper,'' Dar Al-Fata shows Palestinian
children the benefits of cooperation. Five pencils draw a house in
an idyllic setting, with a dog, cat and crows, but a donkey
intrudes and takes over the house. Pencils, paper, animals and
crows confer and decide to attack.
   ``The pencils rained down blows on the donkey, the cat bit the
donkey, the dog bit the donkey, and the crows pecked at the
donkey,'' the book says.
   ``Though (the donkey) brayed and kicked out violently, he was
forced after a while to flee.''

   A man was arrested Saturday after he
allegedly pushed his cousin through the window of a moving train
while they were on their way to work, police said.
   Ryan Smith, 18, of Jersey City, was pronounced dead at St.
Mary's Hospital in Hoboken at 11:50 p.m. Friday, about an hour
after he was rescued from the tracks, officials said.
   His cousin, Eddie Lee Warren, 20, who lived in the same
apartment building as Smith, was charged with manslaughter, said
Port Authority police Lt. James McGovern.
   Smith, Warren and three other men boarded the Manhattan-bound
train in Jersey City and were on their way to work in Weehawken,
where they were employed by Wells Fargo Guard Service, McGovern
said.
   ``There was some horseplay and some fooling around and some
violent contact on the train,'' he said. ``As a result of that, the
victim was ejected'' through a window which had fallen out of its
frame.
   The train was traveling at 12 mph when an emergency brake was
pulled. Passengers brought Smith back onto the train, which took
him to the Hoboken station where he was met by an ambulance. The
train apparently did not run over him, McGovern said.
   Smith's only visible injury was a cut on his forehead and the
cause of death was unknown, said Ed Capparucci, a hospital
spokesman. An autopsy was planned.

<HEAD>India Terminates Trade Treaties With Nepal, Officials Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   India has ended trade and transit
agreements with Nepal despite a proposal by the Himalayan kingdom
for negotiations on new treaties, Nepalese officials say.
   The Indo-Nepalese trade treaty expired a year ago and India
terminated its provisions Thursday night, according to a notice
given Nepalese officials by the Indian government.
   A separate transit agreement expired Thursday even though
Nepalese authorities had asked India to continue adhering to its
provisions until a new arrangement was signed, a spokesman of
Nepal's Foreign Office said Friday.
   Nepal also has proposed immediate negotiations on a new treaty.
   But India had been insisting that both the trade and transit
treaties be linked in a single new treaty, the official said.
   Nepal's foreign minister, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, was to
travel to New Delhi on Sunday for talks on resolving the matter.
   Nepalese officials said that, according to the Indian
government's notice, 13 of the 15 customs check points along the
nations' 1,090-mile border have been closed because of the
treaties' termination.
   The officials also said that under the transit treaty, India had
provided free access for the overland transportation of goods
imported and exported by Nepal. Now, they said, the Indian
government has imposed customs duty on all goods exported to India
from Nepal.
   The officials said Nepal had not changed its customs rates for
trade with India.

<TEXT>
   A United Airlines jumbo jet bound for
San Francisco with 357 people aboard returned to Manila today after
a piece of one wing peeled off over the Pacific Ocean.
   The Boeing 747 landed safely at Manila's airport, and no serious
injuries were reported to the passengers or crew of Flight 820.
   Last month, the cargo door of a United Boeing 747 blew off after
the craft left Honolulu, ripping a huge hole in the side of the
fuselage. Nine people died when they were sucked out of the hole.
   In today's accident, passenger Jonathan Miller of Torrance,
Calif., said the plane began to vibrate after a 10-by-3-foot hole
appeared in the right wing between the fuselage and the nearest
flaps.
   ``First, I felt a bump, then the plane began vibrating,'' said
Miller, who was seated near the wing. ``I saw a foot of the
starboard wing peel off and then other pieces followed. You can
clearly see through the hole.''
   Rob Doughty, a United spokesman in Chicago, said a 3-by-5-foot
portion of a fiberglass panel fell off the wing. But he said there
were other panels beneath it and that the accident did not leave a
hole in the wing.
   ``It's not a hole at all,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration
in Washington, said in an interview that the panel ``was strictly
there for streamlining.'' He said it was ``not structurally
significant'' and that there was ``no compromise to the structural
integrity of the airplane.''
   Doughty did not know how high the plane was flying when the
accident occurred, but Miller, a 50-year-old aircraft products
engineer, said it was probably about 35,000 feet above the Pacific
Ocean at the time.
   Witnesses who saw the plane after it returned to Ninoy Aquino
International Airport said the torn portion was just above the
flaps near the fuselage. Security forces kept reporters away from
the aircraft.
   Rudy Flores, the airport's supervising air traffic controller,
said the crew discovered a fiberglass section of the wing had torn
off about 30 minutes after the plane took off from Manila.
   Doughty said the Boeing 747-100 was delivered to United in Nov.
28, 1970. He refused to speculate on the cause of the accident, but
he said the age of the plane probably played no role.
   ``It's too early to tell what the problem is, and to jump to the
conclusion that it was age of the airplane at his point is
irrelevant,'' he said.
   Flores said the pilot informed the airport's tower the damage
was considered minor and emergency assistance would not be needed.
   Miller said there was ``very mild panic'' inside the plane when
the passengers learned about the torn wing section. He said one
passenger suffered an apparent heart attack.
   ``Nobody was hurt,'' Flores said in a telephone interview. ``But
because of the damage, the flight has been canceled.''
   Dr. Edgardo Francisco, the airport doctor, said one passenger
showed symptoms of a heart attack but recovered after taking
sedatives.
   The plane left Manila airport at 10:11 a.m. for an intermediate
stop in Tokyo en route to San Francisco, Flores said. Basso said
the plane's 340 passengers and 17 crew members were safe and would
be flown on later flights.
   In April a crew member was killed and 61 passengers were injured
when a section of fuselage ripped off a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines
Boeing 737.
   That accident over Hawaii and other recent structural failures
have focused public attention on the age of America's airplane
fleet, currently estimated to average about 12.7 years. The U.S.
aviation industry is studying ways to keep America's aging aircraft
aloft and avoid structural failure in the future.

   Here is a look at the new Congress of People's
Deputies that Soviets will elect Sunday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   COMPOSITION=
   The Congress will have 2,250 members, elected in three different
blocs of 750 members:
   _ Deputies chosen from the Communist Party, its affiliates,
trade unions and professional and social organizations have been
elected during the past two weeks. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
was chosen as one of 100 deputies representing the Communist Party.
   _ Voters will elect deputies from geographical districts of
equal population throughout the country.
   _ Deputies will be elected representing the 15 constituent
Soviet republics and autonomous territories and regions that are
official homelands of more than 100 ethnic groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CAMPAIGN AND BALLOTING=
   In most districts, the elections are the first multicandidate
races in memory. Campaigning began Dec. 26. Meetings of at least
500 people were empowered to nominate candidates, and the nominees
were placed before an electoral commission that decided which
candidates would go on the ballot.
   Candidates were allowed up to 10 people on their campaign staff
and permitted to campaign in the state-run media.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DUTIES OF THE CONGRESS=
   The congress will meet once a year. Once it is constituted, its
duties will include:
   _ Electing the Soviet president, who will assume more power. The
president will be in charge of general administration of the
country and will lead the Defense Council, make proposals to the
Supreme Soviet, negotiate with foreign countries and sign treaties
and laws.
   _ Electing about 400 of its members to the country's actual
working legislature, the Supreme Soviet, which will meet for two
four-month terms each year.
   _ Making changes in the Soviet Constitution.
   _ Reviewing the president's choices for premier and the chairman
of the Supreme Court.

   Here is a glance at the major issues in the
campaign for the Soviet Union's new Congress of People's Deputies,
which ends with nationwide elections on Sunday:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ECONOMY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Candidates list improving the economy and providing better food
supplies and consumer goods as top priorities. Store shelves are
emptier than they have been in years. The government has
acknowledged a large budget deficit and the existence of inflation.
   Candidates' approaches range from support for President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to calls by maverick Boris N. Yeltsin for radical cuts
in the number and powers of government ministries and the
elimination of special privileges for top Communist Party and state
officials. Many candidates have applauded Gorbachev's announcement
that military expenditures will be cut to shift attention to the
consumer economy.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ETHNIC GROUPS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Races in the Baltic republics and some other areas dominated by
non-Slavic ethnic groups have become contests between ethnic groups
or between the local Communist Party and the grassroots People's
Fronts that stress greater autonomy.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ECOLOGY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Dangerously polluted air and water, and food that is overtreated
with chemical fertilizers and pesticides have been cited by many
candidates throughout the country as a top concern. Some candidates
have called for all of the country's nuclear power plants to be
shut down, but many have made no firm proposals.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ELECTORAL PROCESS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The election process, pushed through the Supreme Soviet by
Gorbachev in December, has been criticized by other reformers as
undemocratic and subject to abuse. Human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov, passed up as a candidate for one of 20 seats alloted to
the Academy of Sciences, criticized the process that allows any
electoral commission to narrow the list of candidates nominated for
any seat.
   Yeltsin has criticized the provision that gives the Communist
Party, its affiliates, and other social, professional and trade
union organizations one-third of the membership in the new
Congress. He also has criticized the party for providing a list of
only 100 candidates for its 100 seats.
   Yeltsin has demanded that all posts be directly elected by the
people, including the country's president.

<HEAD>Haughey Likely To Offer Ireland As Summit Venue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey is likely
to offer Ireland as a venue for the next superpower summit when he
meets Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on April 2, government
sources said today.
   The first meeting between the two leaders, which Gorbachev
requested, will be held at Shannon International Airport in western
Ireland during a refueling stop on the Soviet president's flight to
Cuba.
   Haughey met with President Bush during a St. Patrick's Day visit
to Washington, and the announcement of Gorbachev's visit to Dublin
fueled speculation Haughey might offer Ireland for the first
Bush-Gorbachev summit.
   Asked to comment on the possibility, a government source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ``An offer to use Ireland is
in the cards.''
   Last year, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was asked
during a visit to Ireland about the possibility of holding a summit
in Ireland. He replied that Ireland, because of its military
neutrality, would be a very ``receptive location'' if it were
offered.
   Haughey will assume the rotating presidency of the 12-nation
European Economic Community in January. Sources said that may be
the reason Gorbachev requested a meeting with the Irish leader.
   Gorbachev has been cultivating closer ties with Western Europe.
He and his wife, Raisa, will visit Britain from April 5-7 on their
way home from Cuba. He is also scheduled to visit West Germany in
mid-June and France July 4-6.
   Haughey said in a statement his brief talks with Gorbachev would
focus on international and bilateral issues including the
development of the ``excellent relationship between Ireland and the
Soviet Union.''
   Gorbachev's stopover at Shannon will be the first official visit
to Ireland by a Soviet leader, said the Department of Foreign
Affairs.

<HEAD>Jackson Urging Renewed Hostage Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson is sounding an Easter
season call for renewed humanitarian efforts to gain freedom for
American hostages held in Lebanon, saying that ``we should go on
the offensive, the moral offensive.''
   ``Renewed effort and hope must replace futility,'' Jackson said.
``It's time now to roll the stone away.''
   Nine Americans are held hostage in Lebanon, as are six men from
other foreign nations. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on
March 16, 1985.
   ``We are concerned about all of those who are held captive,
whether they are Lebanese or French or British of American,''
Jackson said in an interview on the hostage situation. ``We are
concerned that a whole nation is held captive to these continued
shellings and bombings.
   ``In a sense, Terry and the others are prisoners of war.''
   Anderson had covered Jackson's 1984 mission to Syria which led
to the release of a Navy lieutenant whose plane was shot down
during a U.S. raid over Lebanon. The Navy man was held for a month,
then released to Jackson. Anderson himself was seized by gunmen in
Beirut little more than 15 months later.
   Jackson said it is important that the Lebanese Moslems holding
U.S. hostages know that Americans are concerned about the
rebuilding of that country, about children in refugee camps, about
bombing and shelling.
   ``We are concerned about that,'' he said. ``So was Terry.''
   ``We should not take the position that Lebanon is a no man's
land cursed with eternal and perpetual war,'' the black civil
rights and political leader, twice a Democratic presidential
candidate, said in the interview. He said the United States should
make clear that it is prepared to help rebuild and restore Lebanon,
just as Europe was rebuilt after World War II.
   He advanced no new proposals for hostage release efforts, but
urged a return to some that have been tried before, saying that the
arms-for-hostage deal with Iran had undone humanitarian efforts
that might otherwise have made headway.
   Two Americans were released during the Reagan administration's
arms-for-hostages dealings with Iran.
   Jackson said that at the time, the administration complained
that ``citizen-to-citizen appeals would get in the way of
government operations. Then it turned out that government
operations meant straight swaps of hostages for arms and money.
   ``We want to put the focus again back on the captured as well as
on our concern about the basic agony of the captors,'' he said.
   Jackson said he is seeking sponsors and support for an effort to
reach the captors of American and other hostages through
advertisements and announcements in newspapers and on radio and
television in the area.
   ``We have no way of knowing the impact, but we do know that they
are read,'' he said.
   Jackson said he would make the radio and TV tapes and would sign
the advertisements.
   ``In Lebanon, the captors are basically nameless and faceless,''
Jackson said. ``Therefore the appeal has to be a broad-based appeal
to the religious and political leaders, and to others who care.''
   Jackson said he has talked with religious leaders from Lebanon
during the past few weeks and will continue those appeals. ``We
should not leave our friends in an out-of-sight, out-of-mind
position,'' he said.
   He also suggested that the United States should seek action on
its offer to pay reparations to the families of 290 people killed
when an Iran Air jetliner was shot down by mistake by a U.S.
warship in the Persian Gulf last summer. That has been stalled
because the Tehran government has not proposed a system for direct
payment to the families.
   Jackson said he would be prepared to return to the Middle East
in the cause of the hostages if he had leads and contacts that
would indicate it would help.
   ``Whenever I make these approaches, I always do so with respect
for our government and whatever plans it may have,'' Jackson said.
``But I still think that within the law, citizens have the right
and the obligation, citizen to citizen, church to church, to also
make appeals and approaches.
   ``Sometimes there's less hostility to citizens.''

   Thousands of people attended a rally today for
Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Communist Party member who has
criticized the privileges of the party's elite in his campaign for
a seat on the new congress.
   Soviets vote Sunday to fill 1,500 seats in the 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies, a new chamber created last year in
broad electoral reforms championed by President Mikhail Gorbachev.
It will be the first contested election in the Soviet Union in more
than 70 years.
   About 10,000 people, chanting slogans and waving posters,
attended the peaceful, outdoor rally today in a large parking lot
next to Lenin Stadium.
   The demonstrators, echoing a central theme of Yeltsin's election
campaign, demanded an end to privileges for the Communist Party
elite, such as special food stores and chauffeured limousines.
   ``Do away with special privileges for politicians and
bureaucrats,'' said a typical placard that one demonstrator held
aloft on a ski pole. ``Servants of the people should have to stand
in line,'' said another.
   About 5,000 people streamed into the parking lot under partly
cloudy skies before the noon rally, and the crowd swelled to more
than 10,000 an hour later, forcing police to hold people back from
a roped off area.
   Hundreds of police lined the entrance to the parking lot outside
of the former Olympic stadium, and scores of officers waited in
dozens of buses parked nearby. Around a bend in the road, hidden by
trees, 50 military trucks packed with soldiers stood by in the
event the rally got out of control.
   ``This is what it must have been like in 1917,'' said a Yeltsin
supporter, referring to the year of the communist revolution. ``I
have not seen anything like it in my lifetime.''
   Rally organizers, from three Moscow political action groups,
obtained permission for the three-hour rally after convincing
authorities it would be better than having an illegal demonstration
such as the one Sunday in downtown Moscow in which thousands of
Yeltsin supporters gathered and marched.
   Yeltsin is running against Yevgeny Brakov, director of the ZIL
auto factory that supplies limousines for the Kremlin leadership,
for the right to represent all of Moscow in the new congress.
   The 58-year-old Yelstin was ousted as head of the Moscow
Communist Party Gorbachev in November 1987. Yeltsin and his
supporters have accused the party of trying to discredit him with
critical articles in the official media.
   Brakov, 51, is running a low-key campaign on the issue of ending
chronic Soviet food shortages. ``I am for a speedy decision on the
food problem, development of food and processing industries,'' he
said in an article written for the newspaper Economic Gazette.
   Yeltsin supporters at the rally said they believed their
candidate, who did not appear at the rally, would win the votes of
5 million of Moscow's 6.5 million eligible voters.
   About 190 million of the 280 million Soviets are eligible to
vote Sunday, according to the Central Election Commission. Soviets
over 18 years old are eligible to cast ballots, except those
certified as insane. Voting is not mandatory, and ballots will be
secret, the official news agency Tass said.
   Voting precincts ranging in size from 20 to 3,000 people will be
set up throughout the Soviet Union, including at polar research and
mountain stations as well as on navy ships at sea, Tass said today.
   The 750 seats in the new assembly that will not be contested in
the election were filled by the Communist Party and other
officially sanctioned groups ranging from labor unions to an
association of stamp collectors.
   More than 80 percent of the candidates for the 1,500 seats that
are up for grabs in the election are party members.
   In a quarter of Sunday's races, only one candidate is running.
   The party has dominated the selection of candidates and will, if
only by mathematics, also dominate the assembly after Sunday's
balloting.
   Moreover, the new chamber will meet just once a year to pick a
working legislature. Thus, the party should be able to stack the
legislature with its own members if it so chooses.
   Nevertheless, the campaign has brought competition and public
debate of a kind almost impossible to imagine in the pre-Gorbachev,
pre-perestroika era.

<HEAD>Art Conservator Restores Graffiti in Main Building on Ellis Island</HEAD>

   Between 1892 and 1954, nearly 17 million
immigrants poured through Ellis Island's main building, many hoping
to make their mark in the New World. Now, as workers restore the
gateway's faded elegance, a conservator is preserving the marks
some immigrants made on Ellis Island.
   Christy Cunningham Adams, an art preservationist from Boston,
has spent much of the past three years stripping layers of old
plaster and paint to find old graffiti.
   ``Giuseppe and Achille came to the Battery the day of the 18th
of May, Saturday, 1901,'' one Giuseppe or Achille wrote in Italian
on a column in what had been a dining hall.
   Mrs. Adams wrapped the column in rice paper, gauze and resin to
preserve the surface, which was covered with drawings, poems and
signatures.
   Workers have discovered about 400 square feet of
graffiti-covered surfaces in the course of restoring the Main
Building.
   Restoration work began on the island in 1984 and is expected to
be completed later this year. The Ellis Island Immigration Museum
is scheduled to open in 1990. Some examples of graffiti are being
removed from the wall for display in a gallery.
   The main building ``was designed as a very grand, gracious,
elegant receiving place,'' Mrs. Adams said.
   From the water, the four cupolas on the corner of the building
create the impression of a floating palace. The vaulted ceiling of
the Great Hall _ the second-floor registry room _ generates a sense
of expectation and a hint of the anxiety people may have felt as
they waited to be processed.
   ``It was a very scary place,'' Mrs. Adams said. ``Some of the
graffiti that we have been able to decipher does reflect that
panic, that despair.''
   One Italian immigrant wrote: ``Damned be the day that I left my
homeland and country.''
   ``It tends to be in places either where they were asked to wait
or where they were detained,'' Mrs. Adams said.
   But beyond expressions of anger or frustration, the graffiti
scrawls reflect a far more basic need: to tell the world of one's
existence. ``Graffiti aren't necessarily a message to anyone, but
the planting, sewing your name in time,'' Mrs. Adams said.
   So must Pietro Mecio have thought when he signed his name on
Aug. 31, 1901.
   Some left messages, or pictures of boats, birds, people. Others
simply put their hand to the wall and drew its outline,
incontestable evidence that they were there.
   Mrs. Adams said she uses the same tools to restore graffiti that
she uses to restore old paintings. Chemical reactions between lime
in the walls and sea air have crystallized the plaster, ``so the
graffiti have been encapsulated in the surface of the wall.''
   The challenge in restoring graffiti comes in putting the words
and images in context. ``It's just not easy to know when it's
done,'' Mrs. Adams said. ``It's new to everybody _ preservation of
graffiti.''
   Mrs. Adams has stripped one section of wall to graffiti. She has
left the black paint and old plaster on the strip of wall above
that. The second band ends abruptly where new plaster starts.
   ``Seeing it like this, you see all the things the building's
been through,'' she says.

<HEAD>New Approach Toward Nicaragua Repudiates Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's new Central America policy is
in large measure a politically mandated repudiation of President
Reagan's views and accelerates what has been the slow but steady
demise of the Nicaraguan Contras over the past 18 months.
   Bush's action on Friday was tacit acceptance of the notion that
without bipartisan congressional support, no policy can succeed.
   As the Reagan administration saw it, Nicaragua was condemned to
the ``endless darkness of communist tyranny'' under the Sandinistas
and military force was the only instrument capable of inducing them
to moderate their policies.
   Under the new policy, anti-Sandinista rhetoric has been muted
and the emphasis is on political, diplomatic and economic pressure
on Nicaragua, as opposed to military force, to encourage a
democratic outcome.
   Bush knew that if he tried to resurrect the more pugnacious
Reagan policy, the Democrats wouldn't stand for it.
   Two years ago, the Contras were riding high. Armed with a fresh
infusion of U.S. aid, the rebels were reinfiltrating Nicaragua at
the rate of 100 a day from Honduras and staging frequent attacks.
   But by 1988, an impatient Congress was rejecting further
military aid for the rebels and Reagan had to settle for
humanitarian aid. Most of the Contras retreated back across the
border into Honduras.
   Now the focus is on using a new package of humanitarian aid _
$4.5 million per month _ for the eventual demobilization of the
Contras and their reintegration into Nicaragua from the base camps
in Honduras.
   Under the new approach, the Bush administration gets the
benefits of bipartisanship _ a coming together of Republicans and
Democrats perhaps for the first time on the Central America issue _
and the prospect of a policy that will be politically sustainable.
   If a peaceful, democratic Nicaragua emerges from the process,
expected to culminate with elections next February, Bush will earn
plaudits all around as the man who found a way to tame an issue
that had festered under his predecessor for eight years.
   The big question many conservatives are asking is whether the
combination of non-military pressures can be enough to make the
Sandinistas do what Reagan had said could only be done by military
force: democratize.
   Reagan, in effect, said of the Sandinista promises to create
democracy: ``We can't trust them. Arms for the Contras.''
   Bush, in effect, is replying, ``Well, maybe they can be trusted.
Food _ but not firearms _ for the Contras but only for a while.''
   If the Sandinistas demonstrate good faith, Congress could cut
off even humanitarian aid by November, two months before the
election, under the agreement announced Friday.
   But if the Sandinistas are uncooperative, Bush has the option of
tightening a 4-year-old trade embargo against the Sandinistas and
encouraging aid donors in Western Europe and Japan to withhold
assistance.
   As a final option, Bush could try to win renewed military aid
for the Contras if he concludes that the Sandinistas are
irretrievably committed to Marxist rule and destabilizing
neighboring governments.
   Under that scenario, the now-discarded Reagan would seem more
plausible in retrospect.
   In any case, just how much the rhetoric has changed from the
previous administration can be illustrated by citing some quotes
from a Reagan speech in June 1986, the day before a House vote on a
$100 million aid package for the Contras.
   ``For over 200 years,'' Reagan said, ``the security of the
United States has depended on the safety of unthreatened borders,
north and south. Do we want to be the first elected leaders in U.S.
history to put our borders at risk?''
   The aid package was approved but that kind of talk is all but
forgotten nowadays.
   The view of Secretary of State James A. Baker III, outlined
Friday, was that Reagan's policy foundered because he couldn't get
Congress to go along on a consistent basis.
   ``I think we all have to admit that the policy basically failed
to some extent because we were not united. We had an executive
branch going in one direction and a legislative branch going in
another,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Michial Patric Thompson lost
his job, his home, his friends and his confidence after he told
Pentagon officials that his former employer was cheating on a
Defense Department contract.
   Two years later, he has found peace and hope for a new life at
an isolated retreat for whistle-blowers tucked into the mountains
of southeastern West Virginia.
   ``I still wake up nights wondering how I'm going to afford to
get the kids new shoes or a new pair of pants,'' said the
unemployed 35-year-old father of four.
   ``Here, at least, I can stoke up the wood stove while I wonder
and not have to worry about my family's safety or look over my
shoulder every time I go out.''
   Thompson's haven lies at the end of a steep, winding dirt road,
best driven in low gear, that just happens to be near The
Greenbrier, an elegant old resort for the wealthy and
well-connected.
   The pine-shaded, 50-acre retreat, dubbed ``The Whistle Stop'' by
owner Donald R. Soeken, a Maryland psychiatric social worker,
provides a respite for those exhausted by the retaliation,
financial loss and stress from revealing fraud or waste in
government or private industry.
   ``Every so often, people would call and they were desperate,''
said Soeken, a former whistle-blower himself, who runs a counseling
service for whistle-blowers in Laurel, Md., a Washington suburb.
``They had no place to go.''
   He started taking them to his country place here early last year.
   Thompson was working at the AM General plant in Mishawaka, Ind.,
in January 1987 when he told government inspectors that documents
on the military's Hummer general purpose vehicle were being
falsified to allow the vehicles to move faster along the assembly
line. He claimed workers made it appear that the vehicles' wheels
had been aligned when, in fact, they had not.
   Spokesmen for AM General, a division of LTV Aerospace, of
Dallas, denied the allegations after a company investigation.
   Thompson said he was fired a short time later. The company
maintains he quit by refusing to accept other job assignments after
he made his allegations.
   No criminal charges have been brought against AM General, but a
Defense Department investigation of Thompson's allegations
continues.
   ``I consider myself to be a patriot,'' Thompson said. ``I didn't
want those boys to be driving defective vehicles and I wanted to
make sure the taxpayers were getting their money's worth.''
   Soeken says Thompson's experience is representative of the
ordeal faced by most whistle-blowers, or ``ethical resisters,'' as
Soeken prefers to call them.
   ``It can go on for years and sometimes you feel like it's never
going to end,'' said Soeken, who has a doctorate in human
development and has counseled well over 100 whistle-blowers.
   ``He was caught in a fear network up there. First you lose your
job, then your friends stop talking to you, then you begin to ask
yourself whether you did the right thing.
   ``You begin to ask yourself `Was it worth it?'''
   Most whistle-blowers think it was, according to research done by
Soeken and his wife, Karen, a statistician and a faculty member at
the University of Maryland School of Nursing.
   The couple's survey of 90 whistle-blowers found that most win
little more than a boost in their self-respect. But many, the
Soekens said, would do it again.
   More than half of those surveyed said they had been harassed by
co-workers, 20 percent lost their jobs, 10 percent attempted
suicide, 17 percent lost their homes and 15 percent had been
divorced.
   ``These people are acting out of their consciences,'' Soeken
said. ``But society sees them as tattletales and it carries the
same stigma as it did when we were kids.
   ``People say `We can't trust you. We don't want you as a
friend.' People use four-letter words to describe them. They become
outsiders, they're no longer company men who can be controlled.''
   Thompson, his wife Robyn, and their children have been at the
Whistle Stop since January, living on a $413 monthly public
assistance check and contributions from friends, family and
strangers. He does odd jobs around the retreat to help pay for his
stay.
   Thompson was paid about $25,000 annually, counting overtime,
while working at AM General. He has averaged $7,000 a year or less
since he went public with his allegations.
   ``I sure wouldn't do it again the way I did it,'' Thompson said.
``I'd try and stay anonymous next time.''

<HEAD>Republicans Relieved by Quayle Performance So Far</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There's a joke about the vice presidency that
Dan Quayle likes to repeat: A man had two sons. One went away to
sea and the other became vice president. And neither one was ever
heard of again.
   The joke underscores the relief in many GOP quarters that, so
far, Quayle has avoided the kind of blunders that would embarrass
President Bush.
   The traditional bane of the vice presidency is to be a
peripheral cheerleader for the administration while the president
and Cabinet members corner the limelight. But for Quayle, who slid
into the vice presidency on a wave of low expectations, negative
press and attacks on everything from his intelligence to his
wealthy background, life out of the limelight is a relief.
   The critical headlines behind him for now, Quayle quietly goes
about his work, settling into his new job amid generally positive
reviews for showing competence in his assignments.
   He has asserted himself within the administration as a voice for
conservative Republicans, become a sought-after speaker on the GOP
lecture circuit and traveled to Latin America in the Bush
administration's first foreign trip.
   With the exception of a particularly strident attack on Senate
Democrats for rejecting Bush's defense secretary nominee, John
Tower, in language that cut against Bush's own conciliatory
remarks, Quayle's statements have been fairly humdrum news.
   He often attends the president's morning intelligence briefings
and participates in top-level advisory meetings.
   Administration officials describe Quayle as more than a passive
participant in these sessions and say he weighs in on a variety of
subjects.
   Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, is said to have regard for
Quayle and seek out his opinion, especially on matters involving
Congress, where Quayle served as a senator and representative from
Indiana, and on foreign policy. Sununu has informed his staff that
Quayle is to be included as an active contributor on policy matters.
   Quayle himself says the most rewarding aspect of his new job is
a close relationship with Bush, developed in almost daily visits to
the Oval Office.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Quayle described it
as a ``comfortable, warm relationship.''
   He has worked to show only the most supportive public face for
Bush, modeling himself after Bush's own loyal vice presidency under
Reagan.
   Should he ever disagree with a Bush decision, Quayle said
recently, he would never make his opposition public.
   In the interview, Quayle said the hardest part of being vice
president is balancing his work with time for his family.
   ``The quality time has been abbreviated,'' he said. ``There's no
such thing as going to McDonalds with the kids.''
   Still the 42-year-old father of three young children has managed
to duck out to a video store with his son and take the family out
for a ribs dinner on occasion.
   ``I think he has tried to stay out of the headlines and become
temperate and not become a lightning rod for Democrats,'' said
Stuart Eizenstat, former domestic policy adviser to President
Carter. Eizenstat gave Quayle an overall positive report card along
those lines, with the exception of the Tower speech in which Quayle
strayed from Bush's congressional fence mending.
   Quayle defended the speech, in which he accused his former
Senate colleagues of tactics recalling the virulent, anti-communist
crusade of the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.
   ``There are certainly things that a vice president can say and
do that it would be best for a president not to say and do,''
Quayle said. He said he will continue to do those things, ``in a
way I think will help the president.''
   Quayle's generally good reviews are amplified against the
campaign background of critical press probes into his National
Guard service, his mediocre academic record, his wealthy father's
influence and his low-key performance in Congress.
   ``He's benefiting tremendously from low expectations _ people
expecting this cartoon character that the media has created,'' said
GOP political consultant Roger Stone.
   Eizenstat contended that Quayle has ``wiped away a lot of the
image of immaturity'' that developed, in part, from Bush campaign
operatives' efforts to ``package'' him.
   Former White House political director Mitch Daniels, who was
enlisted by the Bush camp as one of Quayle's campaign handlers,
said he felt all along that Quayle ``would exceed expectations
because of the coverage last fall. ... What has surprised me is how
quickly he's been able to establish himself.
   ``It's both because the president has been eager to see him
rehabilitated and because he stood out somewhat from the rest of
the administration,'' Daniels said. He characterized the new
administration as getting off to a slow start, making Quayle ``sort
of pastel against a beige background.''
   Quayle's specific duties are to chair Bush's new Council on
Competitiveness and his national Space Council. The news has been
quiet so far on both fronts.
   He also has shown an interest in making Latin America a
specialty interest after his three-day swing through Venezuela and
El Salvador. While there he delivered a tough pro-human rights
message to the Salvadoran military, and extended the Bush
administration's hand to a number of heads of state who gathered
for the Venezuelan inauguration.
   On the speakers' circuit, Quayle has been drumming up support
for the administration with conservative-toned addresses to such
groups as religious broadcasters and Cuban-Americans.
   In the process he is solidifying his base with the right, said
David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.
   ``The conservatives are gradually becoming less enamored with
George Bush,'' Keene said. ``Quayle begins to look better as he
makes some attempt to reach out to them.''

   Premier Li Peng's call last week for huge
spending cuts to slow the overheated economy has angered local
officials, highlighting centuries-old tension between China's
central government and its unruly provinces.
   Beijing demands austerity. That's fine, the provinces say, but
not at their expense.
   China's local governments have taken swipes at Li's plan to slow
exaggerated industrial growth and high inflation through
recentralization of the economy under a government less generous
with handouts.
   First to speak out was the governor of Guangdong, China's most
prosperous province, located next to Hong Kong, about 1,200 miles
from Beijing.
   ``Guangdong should be an exception,'' Ye Xuanping Thursday told
delegates to the National People's Congress, China's legislature.
``We are a special province and we should be treated differently.''
   Next came Chen Xitong, mayor of the capital, Beijing, which is
treated as a province by the Chinese government.
   ``Beijing must be protected, must be protected,'' Chen boomed
during a session with delegates from Beijing. ``After all, China
only has one capital.''
   Officials from Guizhou, Qinghai and Yunnan, all poorer
provinces, followed suit.
   ``Look at all these big buildings in Beijing,'' said one
delegate from Yunnan, a rural province in China's mountainous
southwest. ``Stop one of those hotels and you'd help thousands of
my people in the countryside.''
   Luo Pingyi, a delegate from Guizhou in the south, said austerity
measures ``should not be applied to us who are falling behind.''
   Local governments have clashed with China's central government
since the Communist revolution in 1949, and for centuries before.
   One dynasty, the Sung, actually abolished provinces in the 10th
century and put all officials under the emperor's direct control.
The communist government regularly rotates its governors to avoid
the development of independent power bases.
   On Monday, Premier Li opened China's annual legislative session
with a call for belt-tightening and thrift.
   China's overheated industrial sector grew 17 percent last year.
Inflation is running at 36 percent, the highest since the Communist
victory in 1949.
   Li said local governments must abandon selfishness.
   ``All localities, departments and units should take the
interests of the whole into account and firmly subordinate their
local interests,'' Li said.
   A day later, Vice-premier Yao Yilin and Minister of Finance Wang
Bingqian weighed in with some specifics: increased taxes and cuts
in funding for enterprises operating outside the centralized state
plan, greater central control of loans, a stronger national bank.
   In addition, provinces and cities, which recently gained the
right to trade with and borrow money from foreign countries, saw
those rights diminished. Poorer provinces were told to expect less
help.
   But many provinces aren't so sure they want the recentralization
of the country's economy.
   Richer provinces benefited from the recent trend toward
decentralizing economic decision-making and the accompanying new
political power.
   Counties got rich opening mines and starting little factories.
Cities prospered, cutting deals with foreign countries and trading
among themselves.
   Poorer provinces still need state subsidies and aid, and their
delegates said austerity will have little effect on prosperous
coastal provinces.
   ``To the coastal areas, the retrenchment is like taking a knife
to the tale of an ox,'' said Huanjue Cailang, a delegate from
impoverished Qinghai. ``But to us poor districts, it's like hitting
him on the head with a brick.''

   Here is the text of a statement from President
Bush issued by the White House on Saturday in honor of the 1979
Middle East peace agreement:
   Ten years ago, representatives of Egypt and Israel met here in
the presence of American witnesses to sign a treaty that
transformed the political map of the Middle East. Of course, I
speak of the peace agreement ending over 30 years of war between
Egypt and Israel.
   The treaty was the product of vision, statesmanship, courage and
persistence on the part of all the participants. Anwar Sadat's
historic trip to Jerusalem illustrated dramatically how one man
could raise his nation above the hostility and isolation the Arab
states showed Israel for over three decades. Menachem Begin's
response demonstrated the courage to overcome fears and obstacles
in pursuit of a larger goal. And the American team pursued every
lead toward peace and contributed critically to the process begun
by previous administrations.
   Recognizing the historic achievement of 10 years ago, however,
turns our minds toward the still more daunting challenges ahead. If
we wish truly to honor those whose bravery and hard work made
possible the peace treaty we need to complete the work they began.
We must commit ourselves as Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin did to
fresh thinking.
   The Middle East today remains a dangerous and volatile area.
Deep seated hostilities and legitimate security concerns frustrate
efforts to expand the peace. And yet there are hopeful signs. The
desire to find a peaceful settlement is increasingly widespread.
There is also a growing understanding that a settlement can be
reached which both satisfies Israel's security needs and addresses
the legitimate political rights of the Palestinians. What worked in
the Egypt-Israel peace treaty _ negotiations based on U.S. Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338 _ can work as the basis for a wider
lasting peace.
   This administration is committed to this goal. We must be
patient but we must never stop trying. The search for peace will
continue to animate our discussions with good friends from Egypt,
Isarel and other middle eastern countries as they visit here or as
we visit there. The best way to do honor to those who gave us the
treaty of peace with Israel and Egypt would be to bring peace to
the entire Middle East.

<HEAD>Prosecution Witnesses Sympathetic to North</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Travel for a moment the rocky road of the
prosecution at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial _ in an attempt to
convict him, you have to rely on witnesses who are hostile to your
case and sympathetic to the defense.
   So far the prosecution's witnesses have included:
   _Nicaraguan Contra leader Adolfo Calero, who tells the jury
North can't possibly have stolen $4,300 in travelers' checks and
describes the fired White House aide as ``sort of a savior'' to the
guerrillas.
   _Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane, who
repeatedly states during five days of testimony that he's to blame
for crimes North is accused of committing.
   _Beer magnate Joseph Coors. In front of the jury, Coors walks
over to North and warmly shakes his hand.
   What will the jurors remember? The handshake or that Coors
acknowledged under questioning that North had given him the number
of a Swiss bank account to contribute money to the Contras?
   Then there's the tear-laden testimony of North's former
secretary Fawn Hall, who praised North as a tireless patriot and
then began crying uncontrollably.
   She bristled at being a prosecution witness. She said instead
that she was ``a witness for the truth.''
   In order to make some of the witnesses stick to the truth,
prosecutors were forced to confront them with earlier testimony
they had given.
   Ex-CIA operative Glenn Robinette repeatedly denied that an
attempted cover-up was designed to protect North. Prosecutor John
Keker confronted Robinette with his grand jury testimony from two
years ago. Robinette said then that the cover-up was an attempt to
help North, who had accepted a $13,800 home security system free of
charge.
   Facing up to his earlier remarks, Robinette reluctantly agreed
that yes, he had been trying to protect North, as well as
Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord, who had paid for North's
security system.
   McFarlane's testimony gave the prosecution fits. Even the judge
in the case described it as equivocal and confusing.
   Under questioning by North lawyer Brendan Sullivan, McFarlane
said North prepared just two innocuous paragraphs of a Sept. 5,
1985, letter to Congress. Other portions of the letter denied the
National Security Council staff was involved in fund-raising for
the Contras or offering them tactical advice.
   McFarlane also testified about a key draft of a Sept. 12, 1985,
letter to Congress containing similar denials. McFarlane first
testified he thought North prepared it, then said he wasn't sure.
   There has been strong testimony for the prosecution from former
House Intelligence Committee chairman Lee Hamilton and intelligence
committee staff director Thomas Latimer.
   They testified of North's alleged statements at an Aug. 6, 1986,
meeting with the intelligence committee denying he had recently
seen a retired Army general who helped the Contras or that he had
much to do with Robert Owen.
   North actually met constantly with Owen, who served as his
courier to the Contras, and had several contacts with retired Army
Gen. John Singlaub in 1986.
   The problem with the charge, from the prosecution's point of
view: there's no transcript of the meeting, just sketchy notes
taken by Latimer. The intelligence committee was able to arrange
the session only on condition that no transcript be kept.
   As the prosecution's case draws to a close this week, the North
trial will focus on then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III's weekend
inquiry in November 1986 which uncovered the diversion of funds to
the Contras.
   No transcript was kept of that inquiry either. The prosecution
will rely on notes taken by Meese aides Chuck Cooper and John
Richardson and call on all three men to recount events that
happened 2{ years ago.
   Their testimony relates to charges that North lied to Meese by
denying the National Security Council was involved in the diversion
and by asserting that Israel determined how much would go to the
Contras from the Iran arms sales.

   Jack Fisher broke a record Saturday as the
person to live longest on an electric blood pump to help his ailing
heart. More than anything, though, the 46-year-old bond salesman
hopes for a transplant.
   ``It's not a record I want to break,'' he said, grinning.
   But ``I don't mind'' being a medical pioneer, Fisher said,
relaxing in his hospital room with his wife, Edie, 39, and four of
their five daughters. The girls arrived Thursday from the family's
home in Rumson, N.J., to spend the Easter weekend with their father.
   Surgeons at Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh
implanted a Novacor left ventricular assist device into a dying
Fisher in an operation that ended Dec. 9. Saturday was his 107th
day with the device while awaiting a transplant.
   He had been diagnosed 3{ years earlier with cardiomyopathy, a
disease of unknown origin that damages heart muscle.
   ``I think the toughest part psychologically is knowing that in
order for you to live, you have to take something (a heart) from
somebody else, even though you know the person can't use it,'' he
said.
   The 1{-pound, polyurethane pump was implanted behind the muscle
of the front abdominal wall as a temporary means of helping the
left ventricle, which does 85 percent of the heart's work.
   Unlike the Jarvik and other total artificial hearts, the Novacor
and other assist devices do not require removing the patient's own
diseased heart. They are intended to keep people alive while
awaiting transplants, although eventually a long-term device may be
developed.
   The Novacor is the only one of the devices to be driven by
electricity, making it less bulky than the air-driven models.
   A heart-assist device driven by electricity, rather than
compressed air, allows the patient awaiting a transplant more
mobility and reduces the risk of infection, said Dr. Peer Portner,
president of the California-based Novacor division of Baxter
Healthcare Corp.
   Thirteen-year-old Alison also has mixed emotions about her
father's feat.
   ``It's kind of funny to think of my dad breaking a record. I
mean, I thought it would be a different record that he'd break, not
this one,'' she said. ``I'm upset that he's sick and everything,
but I'm happy he's alive.''
   A tube protruding from Fisher's abdomen carries electrical wires
that feed into a tiny white box on his lap. The box, in turn, is
connected by 20 feet of cable to a 440-pound console and computer
that control the pump and monitor his heart rhythm. A technician
pushes the equipment beside him on his daily strolls down hospital
hallways.
   Ever present is the loud, constant click of the pump as it
distributes blood through Fisher's body. The noise doesn't bother
him, and the pump is painless.
   ``If this stops clicking, I'm in trouble,'' he said.
   Dr. Robert Kormos, one of his surgeons, says it's hard to say
how long the Novacor pump could sustain Fisher.
   ``It's been essentially working faultlessly,'' Kormos said.
   Since the first Novacor implant in 1984 at Stanford University,
41 of the pumps have been used on people awaiting transplantation,
Portner said.
   Eighteen of the 41 patients went on to receive human hearts and
were alive as of Friday, Portner said. Of the remaining 23, Fisher
and three others were still on the device, 15 died while on the
Novacor, and four died after getting a transplant.
   Until Saturday, the record for the most time on a left-ventrical
assist device was 106 days, set in January by a 64-year-old patient
at Methodist Hospital in Houston who spent that long on a Novacor
before receiving a human heart. The transplant was not successful
and he died three days later.
   The survival record for a total artificial heart is much longer:
William Schroeder of Jasper, Ind., lived 620 days on one before he
died in August 1986. But artificial heart patients have all had a
variety of complications, and use of the devices as permanent
replacements for diseased hearts has been largely suspended.
   More than 1,200 Americans are awaiting heart transplants.
   ``Obviously, there's a great need to increase as much as
possible the number of (heart) donors available,'' Portner said.
``The only alternative for all those patients is a mechanical
device.''
   Fisher, on leave since January 1988 from Shearson Lehman
Brothers in New York, says he is confident he'll pull through a
transplant once a suitable donor heart is found.
   He doesn't sit around worrying when his day will come.
   ``You don't have any control over it. There's nothing I can
do,'' he said, shrugging. ``These guys already took care of me
once. I say they're going to take care of me again.''
   ``He's always been one to fight the odds,'' his wife agreed.
``He's already proven that here.''

<HEAD>Nuclear Plants Fail to Make Changes Ordered After Three Mile Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly four out of five U.S. atomic reactors
have failed to complete sweeping safety changes required following
the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, Nuclear Regulatory
Commission records show.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., a NRC critic who requested the
documents, said the data shows ``that we may be as vulnerable to a
meltdown in the 21st Century as we were in 1979.''
   Only 24 of the nation's 112 licensed commercial reactors have
installed all 149 changes outlined in the Three Mile Island Action
Plan, drafted in the wake of the nation's worst commercial nuclear
accident. The Pennsylvania plant suffered a partial core meltdown
10 years ago Tuesday.
   Of the 88 reactors not in compliance, 54 do not plan to complete
all the safety changes by the end of this year and several will not
finish until ``well into the 1990s,'' Markey said.
   While some of the safety requirements were minor, others had
been labeled top priority by the NRC and given deadlines that have
long passed, notably in the case of some control room and
instrument improvements.
   NRC officials defended their performance, saying reactors have
met 97.5 percent of the post-TMI changes. Markey rejected that
argument.
   ``Nuclear power isn't horseshoes,'' he said. ``The difference
between coming close and getting the job done can mean the
difference between safety and catastrophe.''
   Thomas Murley, director of nuclear reactor regulation, conceded
the record could be better on the safety changes.
   ``When you look back at 10 years, it's hard for me to justify
it,'' Murley said. ``But we have to make safety judgments all the
time. We're satisfied that we can operate the plants safely.''
   Murley said part of the problem was putting too many
requirements on the nuclear industry in the wake of Three Mile
Island and then not giving utilities enough time to implement the
changes. The changes mandated by the Three Mile Island report cost
each plant an average of $50 million, he said.
   ``We were overly optimistic,'' Murley said in an interview
Friday. ``We did not properly estimate the amount of work that it
was going to take the plants.'' He also said if the NRC ``had to go
through this again, we would be more discriminating on what is
required. I think we laid too much on the industry. Not all the
requirements are absolutely necessary.''
   Nevertheless, Murley said he believes a half-dozen requirements
pointed out by Markey are important, and he vowed to pressure the
industry to complete those changes.
   ``We are going to turn the heat up and require that these will
be completed,'' he said. ``We want to know why it's not done.''
   The NRC documents showed that:
   _ Twenty-three reactors have failed to install display consoles
to help reactor operators more quickly determine a plant's safety
status. That had been designated a top priority by the NRC
following Three Mile Island and given a Jan. 1, 1982, deadline.
   _ Thirteen reactors have not installed instruments specifically
to detect core cooling, a requirement that also was given a top
priority by the agency. The NRC-imposed deadline was Jan. 1, 1981.
   _ Nine reactors have failed to install instruments to tell
operators about the conditions inside the containment vessels. The
Jan. 1, 1980, deadline is almost a decade old. This too received
NRC's top priority designation.
   _ Despite a Jan. 1, 1983, deadline, 63 reactors still have not
conducted a detailed review of their control room designs to
determine if they are sufficient for operators to cope with an
accident.
   _ Eleven reactors have not tested and analyzed reactor coolant
valves and pipes to make sure the equipment is ``qualified for the
full range of operating and accident conditions.'' The deadline for
this priority-one requirement was July 1, 1981.
   _ Five reactors have failed to establish an emergency operations
center to coordinate evacuations and emergency operations in case
of an accident. The deadline was Jan. 1, 1981.
   Markey said 25 reactors were licensed and permitted to operate
following the Pennsylvania accident without meeting all the
post-TMI requirements, and nine others have restarted or may soon
restart without meeting all the standards.
   Murley said no plants have ever been fined or shut down for not
meeting the requirements.
   Markey, in a letter to NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr., lambasted
the commission's actions on the regulations, which stem from a
presidential commission's recommendations.
   ``The TMI Action plan was a major test of the commitment of the
NRC to public health and safety,'' the congressman said. ``It is a
test which the NRC has clearly failed.''
   Murley, however, defended the NRC, saying the commission has
``made plants substantially safer since Three Mile Island, and that
is showing up in all the performance indicators we see. Everything
is turning in the right direction. We're confident we've done the
right thing.''
   The nation's most troubled plants generally had the most
post-TMI requirements that have gone unmet, the NRC documents
showed.
   Each of the three Browns Ferry plants in Alabama have not
complied with 22 separate requirements, including five of the six
listed by Markey.
   San Onofre I in California failed to meet 10 of the regulations,
and the Pilgrim plant in Massachusetts, the Shoreham plant on Long
Island and Millstone I in Connecticut each failed to meet eight
reglations.

<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old girl let two boyfriends
into her home so they could kill her father, who was strangled,
stabbed and beaten on the head with a fireplace poker, police said.
   Michelle Say was taken into custody Friday in connection with
Tuesday's death of Ronnie Edward Say, 47. Officers already had
arrested two boys who Say reportedly had not wanted around his
daughter.
   Ironically, Say, who recently was divorced, had moved to Manteca
with his daughter in hopes of avoiding urban crime in the San
Francisco Bay area 75 miles west.
   Witnesses told investigators that Michelle let the boys into her
home before she went to school, where she was a seventh grade
student.
   ``She knew when she left the house that they were going to kill
him,'' Capt. Charles Halford said.
   A girlfriend reported that the two boys met her and Michelle in
a park Tuesday evening and made statements about the slaying.
Michelle then returned home and found her father's body in a pool
of blood in the bathroom.
   ``What is unusual about this one is the age of the defendants
and the brutality of the crime,'' Halford said. ``He was beaten
repeatedly with fireplace tools. He was strangled, stabbed and
beaten. The autopsy shows he could have died from all three.''
   Berto Talaveras, 15, and his cousin, Juan Valdez, 13, were
charged with attacking Say when he returned home from work. A
Juvenile Court judge officially made their names public despite
their ages because the names already had been published in two
newspapers.
   Despite their youth, both boys outweighed Say. State Department
of Motor Vehicles records describe the victim as 5-foot-3, 125
pounds. Police said the boys weighed between 160 and 170 pounds
each.
   Judge Duane Martin also allowed reporters and news photographers
into Juvenile Court for Friday's arraignment of Talaveras and
Valdez, an unusual action because most Juvenile Court proceedings
are kept secret. Martin said he had the legal discretion under
California law to open the proceedings to the public because of the
crime's ``heinous nature.''
   Separate public defenders were appointed to represent each boy,
and the arraignment was continued until April 13. The defendants
cannot be tried as adults because they are under 16, so the maximum
penalty they can face is sentencing to the California Youth
Authority until age 25, the judge said.
   Max Valdez, brother of defendant Juan Valdez, was quoted in the
Modesto Bee as implicating Michelle Say, or Micke as he called her.
   ``Micke was in on it,'' Max Valdez told the newspaper. ``Micke
always hated her father, She wanted him dead.''
   The newspaper said Michelle dated Juan Valdez after the Says
moved to Manteca last September and was dating Talaveras at the
time of her father's death.
   Talaveras was expelled from Manteca High School last year, said
district spokesman William Whiteside; he refused to reveal the
reason.

<HEAD>Bush Says `Fresh Thinking' Needed on Middle East Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday called for ``fresh
thinking'' to combat the daunting challenges that remain in the
Middle East a decade after the historic accord between Israel and
Egypt.
   Bush said in a statement released by the White House that the
treaty that ended more than 30 years of war between the two
countries was ``the product of vision, statesmanship, courage and
persistence on the part of all the participants.''
   Bush was spending the weekend with his family at Camp David, the
Maryland presidential retreat where Israel's Menachem Begin and
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat worked out the historic agreement
with then-President Jimmy Carter.
   ``Recognizing the historic achievement of 10 years ago, however,
turns our minds toward the still more daunting challenges ahead,''
the president said. ``We need to complete the work they began. We
mustcommit ourselves, as Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin did, to
fresh thinking.''
   Bush said there is ``growing understanding that a settlement can
be reached which both satisfies Israel's security needs and
addresses the legitimate political rights of the Palestininans.''
   Bush and his wife Barbara were spending the Easter holiday with
three of their five children and six grandchildren. Joining them at
Camp David was country singer Lee Greenwood, who was a fixture in
the Bush campaign entourage ast year, and his family.
   The Bushes were to attend Easter services at Camp David with
base personnel, and then dine on an Easter dinner of turkey, sweet
potatoes and blueberry pie.
   On Monday, the Bushes host the annual Easter egg hunt on the
White House grounds.

<HEAD>United Jetliner Lands Safely After Panel Rips Off Wing Over Pacific</HEAD>

   A panel ripped off the right wing of
a United Airlines jumbo jet over the Pacific Ocean on Saturday, but
the plane returned safely to Manila and none of the 357 people
aboard was injured.
   The Boeing 747 landed at Ninoy Aquino International Airport
about an hour after departing for Tokyo and San Francisco.
   The accident did not affect the plane's ability to fly, the
airline and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said.
   Last month, the cargo door of a United Boeing 747 blew off after
the plane left Honolulu for Auckland, New Zealand, ripping a huge
hole in the side of the fuselage. Nine people died when they were
sucked out of the hole.
   In April 1988 a crew member was killed and 61 passengers were
injured when a section of fuselage ripped off a 19-year-old Aloha
Airlines Boeing 737.
   These accidents and other recent structural failures have
focused the attention of the U.S. aviation industry and the public
on the age of America's airplane fleet, estimated to average about
12.7 years.
   The plane involved Saturday was delivered to United more than 18
years ago, but an airline spokesman said he doubted its age was a
factor in the accident.
   Passenger Jonathan Miller, a 50-year-old aircraft engineer from
Torrance, Calif., said the plane began to vibrate after a
10-foot-by-3-foot strip of the right wing blew off above the flaps
near the fuselage.
   ``First, I felt a bump, then the plane began vibrating,'' said
Miller, who was seated near the wing. ``I saw a foot of the
starboard wing peel off and then other pieces followed. You can
clearly see through the hole.''
   But Rob Doughty, a United spokesman in Chicago, said the portion
of a fiberglass panel that fell off was only five feet long and
three feet wide.
   He said there were other panels beneath it and that the accident
did not leave a hole in the wing. ``It's not a hole at all,'' he
said in an interview.
   Fred Farrar, an FAA spokesman in Washington, told The Associated
Press the panel that flew off ``was strictly there for
streamlining.''
   He said it was ``not structurally significant'' and that there
was ``no compromise to the structural integrity of the airplane.''
   Doughty did not know how high the plane was flying when the
accident occurred, but Miller said it was probably about 35,000
feet above the Pacific Ocean at the time. Miller said there was
``very mild panic'' inside the craft when the passengers learned
about the torn wing section.
   Maria Rowena Pizarro, a Filipino passenger traveling to Chicago,
said she felt the plane vibrating but assumed it was wind
turbulence. ``I knew something was wrong when we saw some of the
passengers seated near the wings frantically waving at the
stewardesses and pointing at the plane's wings,'' she said.
   Mrs. Pizarro said a crew member emerged from the cockpit, looked
at the wing and announced the plane was returning to Manila.
   ``We were assured by the crew that everything was OK,'' she
said. ``And since we were not instructed to take any emergency
procedures, I knew we were safe.''
   Rudy Flores, supervising air traffic controller at Manila's
airport, said the crew discovered a fiberglass section of the wing
tore off about 30 minutes after the plane took off from Manila.
   Flores said the pilot radioed the airport's tower that the
damage was considered minor and emergency assistance would not be
needed.
   ``Nobody was hurt,'' Flores said in a telephone interview. ``But
because of the damage, the flight has been canceled.''
   Dr. Edgardo Francisco, the airport doctor, said one passenger
showed symptoms of a heart attack but recovered after taking
sedatives.
   A United official in the Philippines said the plane's 340
passengers and 17 crew members would be flown from Manila on Sunday.
   Doughty said the Boeing 747-100 was delivered to United in Nov.
28, 1970. ``It's too early to tell what the problem is, and to jump
to the conclusion that it was age of the airplane at his point is
irrelevant,'' he said.

   A man who stole $25 worth of alms and three silver

found him hiding under the parish priest's bed, the ANSA news

   The priest called police after he heard a noise in the rectory
of the church, known as Santa Maria in Campitelli.
   Police found the man with the money and the silver hearts in his

   The hearts were offerings made to the church by parishoners who

<HEAD>Four Palestinians Killed, 35 Wounded or Injured in Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Four Palestinians were killed Saturday and 35
others were injured in some of the bloodiest outbreaks of
anti-Israeli violence in the occupied territories, according to
Arab and Israeli reports.
   The army confirmed four people were dead and nine wounded.
   It said two Palestinians were killed in clashes with soldiers in
the occupied Gaza Strip. The bodies of two others found in Gaza
were apparently killed after being suspected of collaborating with
Israel, Arab reports and Israeli media said.
   The four deaths raised to 411 the number of Palestinians who
have been killed in the 15-month-old uprising against Israeli rule,
including 60 suspected Arab collaborators. Eighteen Israelis also
have died.
   Also Saturday, about 60 Israeli peace activists, including three
rabbis, traveled to the West Bank town of Beit Sahour, where they
discussed peace with dozens of Palestinians over plates of chicken
and salad, witnesses said.
   The activists of the ``Peace Now'' movement said they sought to
prove ``dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians is possible when
the government and the army do not interfere.''
   The body of one alleged collaborator, Jamel Abdel Hamid Nadi,
was found Saturday behind a school in Gaza City's Rimal Quarter
with multiple stab wounds and signs of beatings, Arab reports said.
   The reports said graffiti reportedly scribbled on a wall near
Nadi's home and signed by the Islamic Fundamentalist ``Hamas'' or
Zeal movement, claimed the group had killed him for cooperating
with the Israelis.
   The other body was discovered in Rafah in southern Gaza and was
identified as Subhi Hamdan Elsoufi, 21. Arab reports said Elsoufi
was killed as a collaborator.
   Israel's television and radio also said both men found slain
were killed on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
   But the army denied either were collaborators and said that an
investigation into their deaths showed ``the men were killed as a
result of an internal feud of a criminal nature,'' in a statement
handed to journalists.
   The two other deaths were in Rafah and Khan Yunis in the Gaza
Strip, where soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing protesters,
fatally wounding Ashraf Abu Jazar, 17, in the abdomen and Adli
Erbea, 22, in the heart, Arab reports said.
   It was the highest daily casualty toll in the rebellion for
about three months. Twelve Palestinians and one Israeli have been
killed in the past week.
   Eighteen Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds during protests in
Gaza Saturday, among them an 11-year-old girl and two 12-year-old
boys.
   Seventeen were injured by rubber bullets in the West Bank, Arab
reports said.
   The army confirmed only nine of the wounded in clashes in the
West bank towns of Nablus and Tarkumiya.
   The clash in Tarkumiya came as more than 500 Palestinians
marched to a cemetery carrying an outlawed Palestinian flag and
wreaths of carnations to commemorate the death a year ago of two
18-year-old Palestinians in the town during a clash with Israeli
troops.
   Two protesters carried a large white banner that said, ``We will
avenge their deaths,'' and signed in Arabic by the PLO-led Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising, the witnesses said.

   As the Reagan administration came to an end,
Dan Howard figured he was out of a job. Then it began to look like
he wasn't. Now, he's been told he is again. But he doesn't know how
soon.
   Howard, assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, finds
himself in an extreme example of the limbo in which some Reagan
appointees are caught by President Bush's failure to act quickly in
filling sub-Cabinet level jobs.
   Howard doesn't blame the president or the Pentagon, saying any
new secretary of defense must be able to select his own spokeman.
But he agrees he has been on a roller coaster, nonetheless.
   The situation is taking a toll on the nerves of the employees
and the efficiency of government departments, say some of those
affected and some outside experts.
   ``So far, with very few people on board, things are not yet
running, let alone humming,'' said Robert Ortner, under secretary
of commerce for economic affairs, who is leaving office after
nearly eight years.
   ``I think it does have a kind of chilling effect on
productivity,'' said Ben Burdetsky, dean of business administration
at George Washington University and an expert in personnel
management.
   ``It affects not only the political people but the nonpolitical
people,'' said Burdetsky. ``These people just don't know what the
boss wants to be done. The longer it goes on the worse it is and
you get a kind of stagnation.''
   Although Bush is taking longer than most recent presidents to
fill the positions, some observers and participants play down the
impact of the delay.
   James N. Mosel, a George Washington University psychology
professor whose specialties include the study of worker motivation,
said, ``If I were doing it, I wouldn't feel awkward about it. I'd
be focusing on the future rather than trying to ease the pains of
the past.''
   ``It's just unusual in that folks aren't used to it,'' said
Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution and a former Eisenhower and Nixon White House
aide.
   Bush is the first president to succeed a predecessor of the same
party since Herbert Hoover took over from Calvin Coolidge in 1929.
   ``Bush wanted to take advantage of that, and he thought that
gave him the luxury of time,'' said Hess.
   When Hoover was elected, there were fewer positions to fill and
more time to fill them, since the incoming president didn't take
office until March 4.
   Two leading Hoover scholars, George Nash and Vaughn Davis
Bornet, both said they were aware of no delay in filling vacancies
in the Hoover administration.
   In this administration, Burdetsky said, ``There is certainly a
lot of anxiety. I have chatted with a few people and they are just
biting their nails waiting to see what is going to happen.''
   Howard was named the Pentagon's chief spokesman, heading a staff
of about 400, when Frank C. Carlucci took over as secretary of
defense in November 1987. Although he made no secret that he would
like to stay on, Howard was telling friends in December that he
expected to be leaving.
   During the course of the bruising fight over Bush's nomination
of John G. Tower to be secretary of defense, however, Howard came
to Tower's attention and the two became friends. Several Pentagon
insiders said Howard was going to keep his job after all if Tower
was confirmed.
   With Tower's rejection and the confirmation of Richard Cheney in
his place, Howard now has been told that he's out of a job, but has
been asked to stick around for a month or so until his replacement
is confirmed.
   ``After 20 years in government, this was a new experience for
me,'' he said.
   At the Commerce Department, Ortner said, most people know by now
whether they will be staying ``but there is some uncertainty.''
   ``Morale could be better ... but morale could always be
better,'' he said.
   Planning for the future is difficult, Ortner said. ``It's
extremely awkward because those of us who are presidential
appointees have been warned to be very careful about conflicts of
interest and cautious about outside contacts. It's very difficult
to make precise plans while still here. Therefore, many of us leave
with some future uncertainties.''
   Howard, asked how he would advise people working amid such
uncertainties, said, ``Just continue to do your job; that's the
key. We didn't put things on hold in my shop. I was determined that
wouldn't happen here. It wasn't easy, but I didn't get so
distracted that I couldn't do my job.''

   IBM's decision to advise employees to stay off
U.S. airlines because of a hijack warning will be examined very
carefully by other companies, the head of Britain's largest
business organization said Saturday.
   International Business Machines Corp., the U.S. computer giant,
said Friday it had notified employees to avoid traveling on U.S.
air carriers from Europe and the Middle East until the end of April
because of a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warning of a
possible hijacking in Europe.
   ``When IBM decides there is something to be concerned about,
other companies will look at it very carefully _ as they should,
because IBM has an enviable management record,'' said John Banham,
director general of the Confederation of British Industry, which
represents 250,000 businesses.
   Banham said companies that had a lot of employees traveling
around the world would have to make their own decisions on whether
to take similar action.
   ``It's worth remembering that IBM must have more people in the
air at any one time than almost any other company, so they have a
particularly acute problem,'' he said.
   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., employs nearly 164,000 people
outside the United States.
   Michael Mates, chairman of the House of Commons select committee
on defense and a member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
governing Conservative Party, said the IBM decision could have a
worldwide ``snowball effect.''
   Mates said he could not blame IBM management because the warning
had been made public and the company might have been open to legal
action in the United States if it had not taken precautions to
protect its staff.
   ``But, of course, the consequences of a firm of this size taking
action like this could have a snowball effect all around the
world,'' he said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
   News of the hijack warning was first reported in Britain's Daily
Express newspaper. The FAA then confirmed Thursday it had issued a
security bulletin to airports and carriers on March 16 about ``the
possibility of a hijacking of a U.S. airliner in Western Europe.''
   Mates said publicizing warnings to airlines opened the door to
``every nutcase in the world'' to telephone an airline with a
threat.
   At Britain's airports, travelers faced delays of up to four
hours because of stringent security checks and air traffic
restrictions, but many flights were taking off less than an hour
behind schedule.
   ``People appear to be turning up an extra half-hour early and I
can't see as many portable cassette recorders, which should speed
things up,'' said Gatwick Airport duty manager John Lyons.
   Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Pan Am flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland Dec. 21 was concealed in a radio-cassette
recorder. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 were killed along
with 11 people on the ground.

   U.S. and Vietnamese technical experts
have discussed plans for further joint investigations to account
for Americans listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War, the
U.S. team said Saturday.
   A statement from the team leader, Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, said the
two sides held the regular talks in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, from
Tuesday to Friday.
   It said the talks were productive and ``concentrated on plans
for moving forward with joint investigations of discrepancy cases.''
   These are cases on which the United States says Vietnamese
authorities should have information, such as American pilots who
were captured but failed to emerge from prisoner of war camps.
   The statement said they also discussed reports in which
Americans were supposedly sighted in Vietnam after the war and
future excavations of warplane crash sites to search for human
remains.
   The U.S. team gave the Vietnamese additional information for
their unilateral investigations, the statement said.
   Harvey is commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution
Center, the Honolulu-based military unit entrusted with resolving
the fates of 2,371 Americans who never returned from the war in
Indochina, which ended with Communist victories in 1975. Of those,
1,737 are reported missing in Vietnam, 545 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia
and six in China.
   In Vietnam, work on the issue has accelerated since an August
1987 agreement between a U.S. presidential envoy, retired Gen. John
W. Vessey, and Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach.
   The two sides since have conducted four joint investigations on
some of the 70 discrepancy cases the United States considers top
priority.
   A U.S. military team flew to southern Laos on March 18 for a
joint excavation of a crash site. Laos had delayed that project for
two weeks in a show of displeasure over U.S. State Department
charges it was not cooperating with U.S. narcotics suppression
efforts.

<HEAD>Officer Killed in `Thin Blue Line' Case Remembered As `Born Policeman'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While attention was focused on the release from
prison of ``The Thin Blue Line'' defendant Randall Dale Adams,
family and friends grieved for the police officer whose murder was
the center of the case.
   ``I noticed that Adams has got a lot of publicity,'' said Randy
Spiller, Robert Wood's best friend as the two were growing up in
Dodd City, a small town northeast of Dallas. ``There's not been
much written about Robert.''
   Wood, 27, was killed in November 1976 when he and his partner
stopped a car whose headlights were off. The motorist responded
with gunfire, shooting Wood five times with a .22-caliber pistol,
then fleeing.
   At his 1977 trial, Adams was sentenced to death for the
shooting, a sentence that was later commuted to life in prison.
   His case received wide attention when the acclaimed 1988
documentary movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' questioned evidence and
testimony used in the trial, and the prosecutors' key witness,
death row inmate David Harris, recanted his testimony.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals earlier this month ordered a
new trial, and he was freed on bail Tuesday. On Thursday, officials
announced that he would not be retried and filed a motion to
dismiss the charge against him.
   Wood's family has had little to say about Adams' release. One
sister said through police that the decision not to retry Adams
shows the state no longer cares about Wood's death. But Wood's
mother, Linzey, said ``It's not going to do much good. It's not
going to bring him back.''
   John Vance, the Dallas district attorney, said Thursday that it
would be difficult to retry a case that was 13 years old because of
problems in finding credible witnesses.
   Wood was born in Oklahoma, one of six children to a Choctaw
Indian couple, Spiller said. The family moved to Dodd City when
Wood was a boy, and for a time, Wood dreamed of playing
professional baseball.
   After graduating from high school in 1969, Wood served two tours
in Vietnam. He then returned to Texas and began working as a
policeman in the veterans hospital in Bonham, just west of Dodd
City.
   One of Wood's bosses at the hospital, Eldon Frair, called him
``a born policeman.''
   The Rev. Lonnie Murphy, the Baptist preacher who married and
buried Wood, agreed. ``Everything he did was to qualify himself as
a policeman,'' he said. ``He would, in a smaller town, have ended
up being chief of police. He had a personality you just couldn't
help but like.''
   He joined the Dallas police force in 1974, working night patrol
in West Dallas _ a dangerous shift in one of the toughest
neighborhoods.
   Sgt. J.T. Carey, who was Wood's last boss in Dallas, believes
the job fit his personality.
   ``He really thought the profession he had chosen would not only
fulfill his ambitions but also would give him a chance to help
people,'' Carey said.

<HEAD>Archbishop of Canterbury to Visit Pope in Autumn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual head of
the Anglican Church, will visit Pope John Paul II in Rome in the
autumn, primarily to discuss church unity, the archbishop's office
announced Sunday.
   The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, who also heads the 70
million-member Anglican Communion, will be in Rome from Sept. 29 to
Oct. 2, his spokeswoman Eve Keatley said.
   Runcie and the pope have met four times _ in 1980, in 1982 and
twice in 1986. It will be Runcie's first visit to Rome as
archbishop of Canterbury.
   ``The archbishop sees the visit as an opportunity to make a
strong affirmation of the commitment of Anglicans and Roman
Catholics to unity whatever obstacles there are to be overcome,''
Mrs. Keatley said.
   The Anglican Church was established during the Reformation of
the 16th century after England's King Henry VIII broke with the
Vatican when Pope Clement VII refused the king a divorce.
   The two largest Christian churches have made tentative efforts
toward unity, but many Anglicans do not accept the concept of papal
infallibility and the likely primacy of the pope in a unified
church.
   In the 700 million-member Roman Catholic Church, a major
stumbling block is the ordination of women, which some branches of
the Anglican Communion accept.
   Mrs. Keatley said the visit had been under consideration before
the consecration of the first woman bishop in the Anglican
Communion, the Rt. Rev. Barbara Harris of the Episcopal Church of
the United States.
   The two church leaders will review the work of the
Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission.
   John Paul, in an Easter letter to the archbishop, welcomed the
visit as ``an occasion for responding anew to the will of Christ
for the unity of his followers,'' Mrs. Keatley said.
   The previous two archbishops of Canterbury, Arthur Ramsey and
Frederick Coggan, both made official visits to Rome.

   Heavy shells fired by Burmese
government forces crashed into neighboring Thailand on Saturday for
a second straight day, Thai police said.
   Police spokesman Lt. Omnard Khamouraijust said authorities
believe the shells, which hit the frontier town of Tha Song Yang,
were aimed at a base of the Karen guerrilla group just across the
border in Burma.
   One Karen rebel was killed along the border and two Thai
civilians in Tha Song Yang were injured Friday when the shelling
set their homes ablaze, he said.
   At least 1,000 artillery and mortar rounds landed in the town
center Friday, Omnard said. The shelling continued Saturday evening.
   The bombardment destroyed the town hall, a police box and at
least 20 houses. Tha Song Yang is in northern Tak province,
bordering western Burma.
   Thai forces Friday fired flares, then two artillery rounds, to
signal to Burmese troops that they had struck Thai territory, said
Tha Song Yang police Col. Taepo Trichana. But the Burmese shelling
did not cease, he said.
   Town chief Punsak Pranutnorapane said officials Friday evacuated
3,000 residents to police regional headquarters 1{ miles away.
Patients in the city hospital were moved to a hospital in a nearby
town.
   The Karens are among a dozen guerrilla groups fighting for
greater autonomy from the Burmese government.

<HEAD>Government Claims It Thwarted New Guerrilla Offensives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Najib's government said
Saturday its air force thwarted new offensives by Afghan Moslem
guerrillas with bombing raids in the past 48 hours around eastern
Jalalabad province.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 345
insurgents and seven Pakistani militiamen were killed in the air
strikes in Jalalabad and southern Kandahar province.
   Amani said only 15 Afghan troops were killed. Six civilians died
when they were caught in a cross-fire in the battle for
government-held city of Jalalabad, he said.
   According to Amani, 173 guerrillas died in bombing raids east
and south of Jalalabad between sundown Thursday and late Saturday
afternoon.
   His figures could not immediately be verified. The
Pakistani-based guerrillas usually report far lower death tolls.
   Fighting was continuing near Jalalabad, he said, but it was
``100 percent certain'' the U.S-backed guerrillas were losing.
   In another air strike south of Kandahar, 172 guerrillas and
seven Pakistani militiamen were killed Friday, he said. The city
has been under guerrilla attack for more than a year.
   Also in Kandahar, Amani said, about 2,500 guerrillas attacked a
security post at Takhta Poll, 25 miles south of the city. He
claimed combatants included 500 Pakistani militiamen and 12 Saudi
Arabian advisers.
   ``They were forced to retreat and were not even able to carry
away the dead bodies,'' he said, adding Afghan troops recovered 95
of 179 insurgents.
   Pakistan supports the guerrillas but denied that any nationals
are fighting in Afghanistan.
   The anti-communist guerrillas launched their first major
offensive on Jalalabad on March 6, less than three weeks after the
Soviet Union withdrew the last Red Army troops who had been helping
Najib's forces in the decade-old civil war.
   The government claims more than 2,100 people, mostly guerrillas,
have died since then in the battle for Jalalabad, 75 miles east of
Kabul.
   Amani said the guerrillas were shelling the city and surrounding
security outposts with artillery and mortars, but he said the
insurgents were 15 to 18 miles from the city.
   Since Thursday night, he said, guerrillas fired 1,200 shells and
artillery rounds on Jalalabad airport and military posts from the
Ghaziabad area south of the city. In the same period, they fired
4,500 rounds from Shewa, a town east of Jalalabad, he said.
Ghaziabad and Shewa are within 25 miles of the Pakistani border.
   ``Our air force's attack impeded their attack and in some areas
they were fully forced to retreat,'' said Amani.
   He said three Afghan military supply convoys have reached
Jalalabad since Thursday with the last arriving Saturday afternoon.
The breakthrough signals a setback for rebels who have besieged the
city since March 6.
   If Jalalabad falls, it would give the guerrillas their first
major city and provide internal headquarters for a
government-in-exile elected in Pakistan a month ago.
   Jalalabad had a pre-war population of 200,000, but fewer than
half that number are thought to remain after a decade of war that
sent 5 million Afghanis fleeing to Pakistan and Iran.
   Amani also charged Pakistani border police opened fire and
killed 18 refugee women who tried to return to Afghanistan at
Torkham to ascertain whether their relatives were among dead
guerrilla fighters. No immediate comment was available from the
Pakistani government.

<HEAD>Police Suspect Animal Rights Activists In Arson Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arsonists set fires that extensively
damaged two animal research laboratories in the Edinburgh area on
Saturday, authorities said, and four firefighters were injured
while battling the blazes.
   Police sent warnings to other animal research establishments in
Scotland to be on alert for possible arson attacks.
   ``We don't know if it was animal rights people but we suspect
them,'' said Assistant Divisional Fire Officer David Mercer. ``The
investigation has been handed over to the police.''
   Acting Fire Chief Peter Scott, who was at both fires, condemned
those responsible for risking the lives of firefighters. ``If
anyone had wanted to design a trap for firefighters they could not
have done better. I'm livid,'' he said.
   Flames leaped up to 20 feet into the air from the the Edinburgh
University animal research unit near Penicuik, 10 miles south of
Edinburgh.
   Fire officials said empty gasoline cans were found later in the
corridors of the unit at Macaulay House.
   Two firefighters were injured as they battled to prevent flames
from reaching dangerous chemicals, gas cylinders and a small
radioactive source, firefighters said. One suffered smoke
inhalation and the chemical burns.
   Dr. Jeff Maxwell, director of the unit, said animals including
sheep, cows and deer were in an adjacent building, which was not
damaged.
   Shortly after the blaze was brought under control, a second fire
was reported at the Agricultural Research Council's poultry
breeding research station at Roslin, two miles away. Firemen said
methylated spirits and soaked rags were found outside the center.
   Two firfighters evacuating the building were cut by flying glass
when there was an explosion, fire officials said.
   John Hearn, deputy secretary of the Agricultural and Food
Research Council, which runs the poultry unit, said:
   ``Much of the world's leading research in these laboratories is
designed to improve animal health and welfare.
   ``Those responsible for such attacks have no regard for either
animals or humans. They show dangerous ignorance and stupidity.''
   The Scottish agriculture minister, Lord Sanderson, visited the
scene of the university fire and described it as a ``major tragedy
involving the loss of much valuable scientific research.''
   Animal rights activists have targeted research facilities in
their campaign to halt what they claim is cruelty to animals used
in laboratory experiments.

   Police in riot gear swept through
one hotel in this desert resort when the West's version of spring
break revelry, already marred by hundreds of arrests, began to turn
rowdier this weekend.
   ``We've got a lot of fights _ a lot of drinkers,'' police Sgt.
Tom Barton said.
   About 20 officers were sent to The Dunes Hotel late Friday after
young people began fighting, breaking windows and throwing trash,
authorities said. The officers told people not registered there to
leave.
   But overall, the huge spring break crowd was generally peaceful,
police said.
   Police said they had been prepared for things to heat up on Good
Friday, which is traditionally the busiest _ and rowdiest _ day of
the weeklong celebration.
   ``This is really the critical night,'' said police Lt. Lee
Weigel. ``It won't get any bigger than this.''
   It was on Good Friday 1986 that young people threw rocks and
bottles and tore clothes off women. Since then, local police have
beefed up their forces with Riverside County sheriff's deputies and
California Highway Patrol officers.
   Weigel, who has observed more than 30 such celebrations in this
city 90 miles east of Los Angeles, said this year's Good Friday
crowd was the largest he could remember.
   ``Kids that are just getting out of school are coming down here,
and they're ready to party,'' he said.
   Arrests in the desert resort during the week reached 1,218 and
officers had handed out 4,742 citations, police clerk Lynette Detz
said Saturday. About 80 percent of the arrests were
alcohol-related, Weigel said.
   One young woman was critically injured early Saturday when she
fell from a second-story hotel balcony onto asphalt, police said.
Witnesses told police she had been drinking.
   Thousands of people cruised city streets, creating traffic jams
that backed up into the open desert.
   Several female cruisers clad in bikinis bared their breasts and
bottoms to the cheers of males. One 14-year-old girl was arrested
for investigation of indecent exposure.
   ``There are some female flashers,'' Weigel said.
   Unknown assailants also used a catapult to lob water balloons
into the downtown area from an unknown location, but that's nothing
new, Weigel said.
   ``I used to cruise _ I used to throw water balloons,'' he
recalled.

   The Customs Service has been ordered to stop
previously approved shipments of thousands of military-style
assault rifles at U.S. borders, a government spokesman said
Saturday.
   Gerard Rudden, a spokesman with the Treasury Department's Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the agency is requesting
enforcement by Customs of the temporary import ban on five types of
semi-automatic weapons announced by the Bush administration earlier
this month.
   ``When the ban was imposed, it included the further importation
of any of these types of firearms, if they had not physically
cleared customs,'' he said.
   Rudden said ``ATF has gone back to individuals who had
importation requests previously approved and told them that any of
these types of firearms would not be permitted into the country.
They were told that the importation privilege was suspended.''
   The Los Angeles Times quoted an unidentified Customs source as
saying that the number of weapons previously approved for import
totaled about 420,000.
   Rudden said he was unable to confirm or deny that figure. But he
added that the numbers specified several months ahead in import
permit applications are frequently much higher than the weapons
actually shipped into this country.
   ``It's not unheard of for someone to ask to bring in 50,000
firearms and actually bring in only 100 firearms,'' he said.
   President Bush will call a high-level meeting early this week to
discuss the status of administration efforts to deal with concerns
about firearms in drug-related violence, and to talk about what
further actions may be taken, a White House official said Saturday.
   The White House meeting is slated to involve Bush along with
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, national drug policy director
William J. Bennett and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The
meeting had been set for Friday, but Brady could not make it that
day, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush said in an interview with The Washington Times that he has
been prompted to ``think anew'' on the issue in the wake of appeals
from law enforcement groups.
   ``I think the whole American people have changed,'' he said.
``When they see kids getting killed in a schoolyard _ and I'm a
strong sportsman, a hunter, have been all my life. And I've
resisted the outrageous claims of some that would strip away
legitimate weapons from legitimate sportsmen.
   ``But here we've got a major new problem _ new in its intensity
_ facing this country,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Police Find Two Bodies, Apparently of Boat People Killed in Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have found bodies of two
women believed to be Vietnamese refugees who drowned after their
boat sank near a Japanese tanker, local newspapers reported
Saturday.
   The bodies were washed ashore on Perhentian Kechil island, 210
miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, the daily New Straits Times said
in a report quoting police in the area.
   Some of the 35 refugees who survived the March 8 sinking said
130 people died when the boat capsized in the South China Sea as
the tanker Nissei-Maru approached to help it.
   The refugees said the tanker collided with the boat, but tanker
captain Yasuo Kawamura said strong waves created by the tanker's
propeller capsized their boat. Kawamura said strong ocean currents
and winds hampered rescue efforts and that three nearby shipos
ignored his mayday calls for help.
   Malaysian police said the two bodies found Friday were taken to
the mortuary of a government hospital.
   On Monday, the body of another woman believed to be a refugee
who died in the March 8 tragedy was found on Perhentian Kechil,
police said.
   The sinking was reported by fishermen who said they saw several
bodies floating in the sea near the island. It was not reported in
Japan until Monday, when survivors arrived in Yokohama.
   Japan's Maritime Safety Agency is investigating the accident,
which is the latest in a series involving the growing number of
Vietnamese fleeing political repression and economic hardship in
their homeland.
   The refugees, known as boat people, risk piracy and disaster in
hopes of achieving asylum in other countries.
   
   Malaysia gives temporary asylum to refugees looking to resettle
in the West. About 16,500 boat people live in Malaysian refugee
camps.

   The government said it released 619
prisoners from jails across the country on Saturday, the eve of the
anniversary of Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971.
   A government announcement said the release commemmorates the
18th anniversary Sunday.
   Among those released were 381 prisoners detained under the 1974
Special Powers Act, which allowed the government to detain suspects
for a year without trial.
   Opposition party members say the act mainly was used against
people within their ranks. The government of President Hussain
Muhammed has denied jailing people for political reasons.

   Given the chance to put a man behind bars for
shoplifting, an athletic footwear store owner instead decided to
put the alleged robber in his shoes.
   Francis Y. Kim, owner of Family Shoeport, not only forgave the
27-year-old man, but offered him a job, gave him a pair of socks to
go with the stolen shoes and drove him home from the police station.
   ``I didn't think he would want to make a mess out of his life
for one pair of shoes,'' Kim said.
   ``He said he needed them so I give him a chance to earn them,''
Kim said. ``If he went to jail, it wouldn't do any good. He'd just
come out and steal more.''
   Neither Kim nor police disclosed the suspect's name.
   ``We've had people drop charges before ... but this is the first
time I've had a complainant drop charges and hire the suspect just
like that,'' said police detective Mike Tanaka.
   According to police, Kim tackled the suspect as he fled his
store Thursday wearing a pair of $105 prestige-brand basketball
shoes.
   Kim later visited the man in jail.
   ``He had no job but he really liked the shoes. I told him jail
would worsen his life, and you come out and do something more
ridiculous,'' Kim said. ``If you can promise me you'll try, I'll
give a chance.''
   ``This is a better way for him, for me and for society,'' Kim
said.

   Colossus, reputed to be the largest
gorilla in captivity, apparently isn't considered much of a simian
hunk by his would-be mate Muke.
   The female was brought to The Zoo near this Pensacola suburb
here on breeding loan from the St. Louis Zoo, but the couple hasn't
quite clicked, said Pat Quinn, director of The Zoo.
   ``They have shown no signs of mating,'' Quinn said recently.
``She has shown no sign of presenting herself and I'm not sure yet
he knows what to do.''
   Muke _ pronounced Moo-key _ is the only other gorilla that
Colossus has seen since he was an infant 20 years earlier.
   Otherwise, the socialization of Colossus, who had lived in
solitude at a zoo in New Hampshire for most of his life, has gone
well, Quinn said. He is no longer abusive to Muke although he does
exert his dominance and herd her around, which Quinn said is normal
for a gorilla.
   But there has been no courting in the courtyard.
   ``Gorillas have to like each other to breed,'' Quinn said.
``Maybe he doesn't think she's pretty, although I think she is
beautiful. And maybe she doesn't care for him too much.''
   Colossus, believed to be the biggest gorilla in captivity at
more than 550 pounds, is considered a good breeding candidate
because he was captured in the wild as a baby and would bring some
new genes into the world's captive gorilla population. Quinn said
he may seek other mates for the animal.

   Jean MacNemar Cannon arrived in the
world on the shoulder of the Baltimore Washington Parkway while a
parade of cars sped by in heavy rush hour traffic.
   Jean just wouldn't wait until her parents could get to a
Baltimore hospital.
   ``It was a thrill a minute,'' her mother, Barbara MacNemar, said
Friday, recalling the race to Baltimore from their Millersville
home nine days earlier. ``She plunked herself out a little earlier
than expected.''
   With Ms. MacNemar's husband, Shelton Cannon, acting as deliverer
and driver, the 8-pound, 8-ounce girl was born in the family's
Volvo.
   When Ms. MacNemar went into labor early March 15, the couple
took their time leaving for the hospital because their first child
was born after 26 hours of labor, Cannon said.
   But just before they reached the Baltimore Beltway, Ms. MacNemar
said Jean was about to be born. Cannon didn't believe her at first.
   ``I'm trying to tell her, `No, no, breathe through it,''' he
said. But the baby was born without complications a few minutes
later.
   Nobody stopped to help, and the couple doubts anyone was aware
of the roadside birth. ``We weren't stopped very long,'' Ms.
MacNemar said. ``Traffic was just whizzing by.''
   Cannon drove mother and child to University Hospital in
Baltimore, where they stayed overnight before being released.

   Fallout over the House Speaker Jim Wright's
ethics woes, the savings and loan industry bailout and Sen. Phil
Gramm's budgetary crusades all pose a potential threat to the $4.6
billion superconducting super collider, a Texas congressman says.
   ``To the extent Wright is weakened by any events related to this
ethics committee thing, it will also weaken our ability to get the
super collider,'' Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said.
   Bryant expressed doubt that a coming report from the House
Ethics Committee concerning his finances would wound the speaker.
But he said unfavorable findings from the panel ``could be
devastating'' to the future of the super collider _ a massive
particle accelerator the Energy Department is planning to construct
at a Texas site.
   Bryant said he detects an anti-Texas undercurrent in Congress.
   ``The kind of budgetary pressure we're experiencing is
unprecedented and there is not a lot of good will right now toward
our state,'' he said.
   Bryant said Texas is being blamed for the planned bailout of the
troubled savings and loan industry at an estimated cost of more
than $100 billion.
   Grumbling is also heard over an austerity plan to close military
bases across the country but which leaves all Texas installations
intact except the Navy's homeport at Galveston, which is under
construction.
   Texas also would gain from the possible construction of a space
station, and members of its congressional delegation are
traditionally at the front of efforts to fund the space budget,
Bryant said.
   ``There is a general perception, with a president, speaker and
all of these Cabinet members (from Texas) and all of our
(congressional) chairmen, that we have too many things going our
way,'' Bryant said. ``And we have to overcome that perception.''
   Bryant said Gramm's opposition to home-state projects of other
lawmakers has caused a measure of consternation in the Senate.
   ``Gramm attacks every proposal here regarding spending, even
those that were worthy proposals, and he's not receiving a very
favorable reception from other senators when he goes and asks for
his project,'' Bryant said.
   Gramm recently told the Senate a coal purchase proposed by Sen.
John Heinz, R-Pa., was ``felony theft of the taxpayers' money,
perpetrated by special interest groups who have spokesmen right
here on this floor.'' He called the Weed Science and Technology
Center at North Dakota State University a pork barrel project that
could bust the budget.
   Not surprisingly, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., replied by telling a
recent hearing that the super collider was not high on his list of
priorities.
   ``Here you are,'' Conrad told Gramm, ``one of the foremost
advocates of being tough on spending, in here advocating a spending
project that would benefit your constituents.''
   ``He (Gramm) was against North Dakota getting a thing, and now
he's in here wanting it all for Texas,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford,
D-Ky.
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said Gramm stands by his criticism of
Heinz and the North Dakota weed project.
   ``The weed research institute was a budget buster,'' Neal said.

<TEXT>
   Ten anti-nuclear protesters were arrested
Saturday at the Nevada Test Site after they telephoned a Las Vegas
radio station to announce they had infiltrated the highly sensitive
desert area.
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said he received a call
from KDWN radio to inform him that the protesters were inside an
old chapel at the site where the nation's nuclear weapons are
tested. He then called security guards, who arrested them.
   Boyer said the protesters were ``just standing around'' in the
old building, which is now used as a storage area.
   Mercury is a tiny base camp about 65 miles northwest of Las
Vegas and within the borders of the test site. It is about 27 miles
from the nearest active testing area, Boyer said.
   The 1,350-square-mile test site is surrounded only by a simple
barbed wire fence, although sensitive areas where tests are
conducted are heavily guarded.
   The 10 arrests Saturday bring to 254 the number of citations
issued since Palm Sunday in the 8th annual Lenten Desert
Experience. The week-long anti-nuclear protest culminates Easter
Sunday and is sponsored by the Las Vegas-based Nevada Desert
Experience.
   Boyer said the 10 people, nine men and one woman, would be
charged with trespassing and taken to the Nye County Jail in Beatty.

<DATELINE>ISMAILIYA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan's King Hussein said on Saturday
that his country, Iraq and North Yemen will boycott future Arab
summits unless Egypt regains its Arab League seat.
   Hussein linked his surprise disclosure of a boycott threat to
calls for an extraordinary league summit to forge unified Arab
strategy for peace negotiations with Israel.
   Hussein spoke to reporters at a briefing with President Hosni
Mubarak and PLO chief Yasser Arafat after they talked nearly five
hours about coordinating a Middle East peace strategy.
   The meeting was in preparation for Mubarak's talks in April and
Hussein's in May with President Bush in Washington.
   Mubarak said a major aim of his Washington talks is to seek
agreement on an international Middle East peace conference.
   Hussein told reporters the four countries decided on the boycott
threat recently when they formed a common market called the Arab
Cooperation Council.
   ``There have been calls for an ordinary or extraordinary Arab
summit,'' Hussein said. ``We are always for a summit and the
members of the Arab Cooperation Council will attend any summit
together. This is a decision we have taken: to attend together.''
   Asked if the opposite was true, Hussein nodded and said: ``Yes.''
   The Arab League froze Egypt's membership in 1979 after it signed
a peace treaty with Israel. Of its 21 member states, only Syria and
Libya oppose Egypt's readmission.
   The Ismailiya summit was held on the eve of the 10th anniversary
of the Camp David treaty, the first and only one between an Arab
country and the Jewish state, which is opposed to an international
conference.
   Egyptian officials said the three-way summit came amid
``encouraging developments,'' including Wednesday's meeting in
Tunisia between U.S. and Palestine Liberation Organization
representatives, which got down to substantive issues for the first
time since the dialogue began last December.
   The officials, who demanded anonymity, also cited Bush's praise
of the dialogue in a newspaper interview in which he said he would
try to convince Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that
``something good might come'' from this.
   Bush is to meet Mubarak on April 3, Shamir on April 6 and
Hussein on May 2.

   An art teacher angered over an exhibit that
prompted viewers to trample a U.S. flag and sparked waves of
protest got revenge Saturday, offering observers a chance to walk
on a caricature of the display's artist.
   The teacher's exhibit, which opened Saturday at the small
Vietnam Museum, features a life-size sketch of artist ``Dread''
Scott Tyler, drawn on cloth in the manner of a police outline of a
homicide victim.
   The cloth is on the floor, and a U.S. flag hangs above it on a
museum wall.
   ``I was upset by seeing my flag on the floor,'' said Gary Mann,
33, a junior high school art teacher from suburban Deerfield, as
visitors walked over his artwork.
   Mann's display is a protest against Tyler's exhibit at the Art
Institute of Chicago's school, which led to daily protests by
hundreds of demonstrators outside the respected museum in early
March. Tyler is a student at the institute's school.
   His exhibit, which has since closed, featured a flag positioned
on the floor in front of a book asking viewers to write their
opinions on ``What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?''
   Mann's exhibit is called, ``How to Display ``Dread'' Scott
Tyler,'' and also offers viewers a chance to record their reactions.
   One woman visitor to the cramped, storefront Vietnam Museum,
wrote, ``An artist he is not, this Dread Scott. He is an
unpatriotic snot. He knows not what this country is about.''
   ``I would do anything short of killing you to stop you,'' wrote
another visitor. ``Where you go, we will be. God Bless America.''
   Tyler, who calls himself a revolutionary, has an unlisted
telephone number and could not located for comment.
   Vietnam Museum owner Joe Hertel said he contacted Mann and asked
him to exhibit the display at his museum after hearing news reports
on it.
   ``It showed contempt for the artist who showed contempt for the
flag,'' said Hertel, a Vietnam veteran himself.
   Mann, who said he graduated from the School of the Art Institute
in 1976, plans to move the exhibit to various Veterans of Foreign
Wars halls around the state.
   Leonard and Ruth Bielski, both 65, said they came to see Mann's
exhibit because they could not be among the marchers at the Art
Institute during the controversy.
   ``The Art Institute was wrong in letting him do that in the
first place,'' said Bielski, a veteran of World War II.
   ``I'm ashamed because I went to the Art Institute myself,'' Mrs.
Bielski said. She said she graduated in 1938.
   Art Institute officials have defended the flag display and the
student's right to freedom of expression. But veterans and
protesters suceeded in temporarily shutting down the exhibit
several times. It closed March 16 after a month of controversy.

<HEAD>Ozal Mixes Threats, Promises In the Face of Slipping Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal struggled to improve
the chances of the Motherland Party in Sunday's local elections as
public opinion polls indicated it would draw only about 31 percent
of the vote.
   The center-right party attracted 36 percent in the last general
elections in 1987 and 41.6 percent in local polls five years ago.
   Surveys also predict Motherland will lose the races for mayor in
Ankara, the capital, and Izmir, the third-largest city. Mayor
Bedrettin Dalan was expected to carry Istanbul, the cultural and
financial center, for the party.
   The opposition has been portraying the elections as an
indication of national mood.
   Seven parties are competing to elect thousands of mayors, city
council members, provincial assembly members, village leaders and
neighborhood representatives.
   Motherland's major rival is the Social Democrat Populist Party,
led by Erdal Inonu and made up of many politicians who served in
the governments of former Premier Bulent Ecevit in 1970s.
   Surveys predicted that the True Path Party, headed by former
Premier Suleyman Demirel, would come in third.
   The 61-year-old Ozal has combined promises of expanded democracy
with threats to resign in his efforts to improve Motherland Party's
chances.
   The prime minister, who has been accused of nepotism by the
opposition, pledged to reshape his Cabinet the day after elections.
Party sources say Ozal's brother Yusuf and his cousin Husnu Dogan
may be left out of the Cabinet.
   Ozal, once lauded at home and abroad as Turkey's economic
miracle-maker, proposed working with the opposition to fashion a
new constitution for Turkey that would bolster democratic freedoms
and lift the ban on communist and religious parties.
   The constitution was enacted in 1982 by the then-ruling
military. It has come under fire as having too many restrictions on
freedom of expression, labor rights and academic autonomy.
   The Motherland Party also has promised voters to reduce income
tax withholding and to grant housing credits that were halted as a
measure against inflation, which hit 75 percent last year.
   Then, on Friday, Ozal told a news conference he would quit if
major opposition gains in the polls made it difficult for him to
govern. On Friday evening, in a TV campaign appearance, he asked
Turks to remember the turbulent 1970s, when terrorism and an
economic crisis paved the way for the 1980 military takeover.
   ``Anrchy will come back to haunt the country, the shortages and
lines for necessities will return,'' if the opposition gains, Ozal
said.
   Motherland Party mayors have completed huge water and sewage
projects and started low-cost housing projects to replace slums
surrounding their cities.
   But it is Ozal's overall record that has been the main campaign
issue.
   Accusations involving inflation, nepotism and corruption in high
places appear to have made an impression on voters, despite
economic advances marked by a $1.5 billion surplus last year.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christian army commander accused
Syrian gunners of trying to assassinate him by shelling the
presidential palace Saturday. Police said 11 people were killed and
61 wounded in artillery duels.
   A communique from Gen. Michel Aoun's command said the palace in
suburban Baabda came under a sustained barrage of rockets ``in a
second attempt to assassinate the head of the legitimate
government.''
   Aoun, who heads the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, charged Syrian gunners blasted his military
headquarters near Baabda March 14 in an attempt to kill him.
   At least one civilian was killed and another was wounded in the
Baabda attack Saturday, police said. The two-story hilltop palace
sustained extensive damage but Aoun and aides were uninjured, his
communique said.
   At least five people were killed and 30 wounded when artillery
barrages resumed in Beirut late Saturday, police reported.
   The new casualties raised the toll to 92 killed and 314 wounded
since March 8, when the latest round in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war broke out.
   Tens of thousands of panicky Beirut residents scurried back to
basements and bomb shelters for a third straight night as deafening
blasts resounded across the capital.
   ``Is this a way to celebrate Easter?'' cried Zeina Touk, a
Christian housewife reached by telephone at the shelter of her
apartment building in east Beirut. ``Damn them all.''
   Christian radio stations called the bombardment ``an Easter gift
from Syria.'' Moslem broadcasts blamed the escalation on Aoun's
forces.
   During the day, Aoun's 20,000 predominantly Christian troops and
an alliance of Syrian regulars and Druse militiamen fought sporadic
artillery duels around Beirut.
   Syrian troops joined Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's militiamen
earlier this week in renewed sectarian fighting.
   Syria, the main powerbroker in this divided country, keeps
40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end
the civil war. It also supports a rival Moslem cabinet led by Salim
Hoss.
   A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the new casualties were civilians. He said no Christian soldiers
were injured, and he knew nothing of any Syrian or Druse casualties.
   The barrage early Saturday against the Christian towns north of
Beirut reached as high as 80 rounds per minute before tapering off
into sporadic exchanges at daybreak, police said.
   About 1 million Christians, one quarter of Lebanon's population,
live in the crescent-shaped, 300-square mile enclave that comprises
around 10 percent of the country's territory.
   The Mediterranean runs along the western border of the Christian
enclave but Syrian troops and allied Moslem-leftist militiamen have
surrounded the enclave's eastern border.
   Christian radio and television stations interrupted their
programs late Friday to broadcast a statement by Aoun's command
warning residents of Moslem west Beirut to take ``maximum
precautions.''
   The statement said Aoun's command had monitored orders from the
Syrian command to shell Moslem areas ``to provoke the local
militias into responding against us.''
   The latest bout in fighting began 18 days ago when Aoun imposed
a blockade of illegal militia-run ports along Lebanon's coast. The
illegal ports have meant losses in Lebanese tax revenues of an
estimated $100 million a year.
   The Syrian-backed Moslem cabinet repudiated Aoun's action. In
retaliation, Moslem and Syrian forces imposed a blockade of the
Christian enclave.

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life in the fast lane moves at 10 mph
on the ``World's Most Famous Beach,'' where the unofficial mottos
during spring break are ``party till you drop'' and ``sun your
buns.''
   Some half-million college students have invaded the resort for
the 85-degree weather and the opportunity to watch scantily clad
members of the opposite sex burn lobster-pink in the bright
sunshine.
   ``This is the largest crowd to ever hit Daytona Beach. Traffic
is snarled. Every parking space on the beach is taken, plus all the
private and public parking near the beach,'' said Beach Department
Chief John Kirvin. ``At times, you can't even find any sand.''
   Sightseeing is one of the most popular activities.
   ``I came here to look at the boys ... I mean men ... to look at
tan chests,'' said Michelle Abbott, a junior at the University of
Kansas.
   And to remember their days on the beach when they return to
college, both men and women aren't the least bit shy about
photographing the opposite sex.
   ``I'm on my second roll (of film) today and and I've got four
more after that,'' said Larry Turner, a botany student at Southern
Illinois, as he focused on a young woman strolling down the sand.
   Some men carried signs urging young women to take off their
bikini tops. One group of women carried a sign urging men to drop
their trunks.
   ``If their parents only knew what their daughters were doing,''
said a beach police officer who asked not to be identified.
   The ``party till you drop'' action moves from hotel pool decks
onto the beach in early afternoon, Kirvin said.
   He estimated that some 200 people have been arrested on the
beach, most for disorderly conduct and alcohol-related offenses.
   Alcohol is not allowed on the beach, but if students follow an
officer's warning to get rid of it they are not charged.
   There is no way, he said, that his 36 full-time officers and 15
part-timers can stop everyone drinking on 40 miles of beach.
   ``We try to curb it with selective enforcement,'' he said.
``Most of the kids are super and very cooperative.''
   Conditions were quite different out West, where spring break at
the desert resort of Palm Springs, Calif., was marred by hundreds
of arrests this year. Police in riot gear were called to one hotel
late Friday after young people began fighting, breaking windows and
throwing trash, authorities said.
   Once again in Daytona Beach, hotel balcony accidents take their
toll. So far this year, four people have fallen, including a
22-year-old Illinois man who died Thursday after lunging from a
balcony to catch a Frisbee. Last year, one person was killed and
seven were injured in balcony falls.
   On Saturday, a single-engine airplane towing an advertising
banner crashed into the ocean just off neighboring Daytona Beach
Shores, killing the pilot, authorities said.
   The aircraft, owned by Aerial Messenger of New Smyrna Beach,
went down in clear weather about a half-mile offshore, said Arthur
Sterritt, a Volusia County sheriff's deputy. The name of the pilot,
who was the only person on board, was not immediately released.
   To the south, former spring break capital Fort Lauderdale
expected fewer than 20,000 students this year, as a result of
strict city rules on drinking and cruising. As many as 350,000
students descended on Fort Lauderdale for spring break in 1985.
   Daytona officials say Fort Lauderdale's loss of college students
is their gain.
   ``They've always been welcome here,'' said Georgia Carter,
publicity manager for Destination Daytona, a branch of the Visitors
and Convention Bureau. ``We've had spring break since the '50s, but
it's just gotten bigger and bigger since Fort Lauderdale decided
they didn't want them there anymore.''
   But why did students endure long hours of travel to reach
Daytona's beach?
   ``I'm a senior and it's mandatory,'' said Joe Marcus, of
Blacksburg, Va., a Virginia Tech student. ``Last year I went to Key
West. This is better.''
   Kevin Lockwood and some friends drove 14 hours from Southern
Illinois University.
   ``I'm here for the sun and the girls and the beer,'' said
Lockwood, a junior conservation enforcement major at SIU.
   ``We read about Daytona in Playboy. We saw the pictures,'' said
Kurt Brewer, a senior chemical engineering major at the University
of Kansas. ``But we're actually here to get away from Dorothy and
Toto.''

   Police arrested a man identified as a
supplier for the illegally brewed liquor that killed more than 130
people in the western Indian city of Baroda, news reports said
Saturday.
   The man was arrested late Friday, Press Trust of India said. The
dispatch did not say if charges were filed.
   Three people were arrested earlier for allegedly manufacturing
and selling the poisonous liquor, PTI said. One of those people
identified the man arrested Friday as the supplier of the methyl
alcohol that made the liquor deadly, the news agency said.
   The illegal brew was made from methyl alcohol instead of its
normal ethyl alcohol base. Methyl alcohol paralyses the central
nervous system, causing death.
   The mass poisoning was the worst ever in Gujarat state, where
more than 300 people have died in similar tragedies since 1981.
Gujarat is the only Indian state that has banned the sale of
alcohol.

   Air traffic controllers returned to

thousands of Easter holiday travelers at Brussels International
Airport.
   The controllers began their strike Friday. They agreed to go
back to work after reaching an interim agreement with the
government on terms for new negotiations. Controllers are seeking
salary increases and improved working conditions.
   More than 100 planes had been grounded since late Friday, and
about as many incoming flights were diverted to other airports.
   Officials said airport operations would not return to normal
until Monday.
   At about noon Saturday some 5,000 travelers were stranded at the
Brussels airport, located in Zaventem. Some were taken to airports
in Luxembourg, France and Germany, but those facilities also were
crowded with weekend traffic.

<HEAD>Anglican Bishop Does Not Believe in Jesus' Physical Resurrection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bishop of Durham, a familiar voice of
controversy in the Church of England, has reiterated his belief
that the resurrection of Jesus Christ was spiritual rather than
physical.
   The remarks of the Rt. Rev. David Jenkins, recorded for
broadcast Sunday by Tyne Tees Television, immediately drew
suggestions he be replaced.
   Jenkins has frequently fueled controversy in the state church by
publicly questioning the literal truth of several basic Christian
beliefs, including the virgin birth and Jesus' rising from the dead.
   Some church members said it was an ``act of God'' when the great
York Minster cathedral was struck by lightning and badly burned
three days after Jenkins' consecration there as bishop in 1984.
   In remarks for broadcast Easter Sunday, Jenkins said knowing
Christ was alive was an inner feeling that did not need the
physical proof of a corpse returning to life.
   ``I don't think it means a physical resurrection. It means a
spiritual resurrection, a transforming resurrection, a real
resurrection.
   ``Because the experiencing, which enabled people to know that
Jesus was alive beyond death, must be more than the revival of a
corpse,'' Jenkins said.
   Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative member of Parliament, accused
Jenkins of ``seeking to undermine the whole doctrine of the
church.''
   ``It would certainly be beneficial if ways could be found to
remove him from office,'' he said.
   Neil Hamilton, another Tory legislator, added: ``When will the
archbishop of Canterbury give a lead and speak out against this
man?''
   Jenkins said he was sure the disciples did not think of the
Resurrection as a physical phenomenon.
   ``If you read the echoes of the narratives, let alone what St.
Paul says, I don't think it means a physical resurrection at all.
It's a real presence, a real renewal of personality which is now
transformed, to be alive forever,'' he said.
   Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, also a Conservative legislator, said of
the bishop: ``Does he not know that Christ appeared before his
disciples and when they doubted he actually showed them the wounds
of the nails on the cross?''
   Another Tory, Irvine Patnick, commented: ``I am sure
Christianity, which has been going on for 1,989 years, will
continue despite his sudden statement which demolishes the church
and its teaching.''
   Controversy over Jenkins' beliefs prompted a church doctrine
study in 1987. A commission of 14 theologians decided such
controversies are ``a sign of vitality in the church.''

   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia received a
red-carpet welcome at the Baghdad airport Saturday as he began the
first visit to Iraq by a Saudi monarch in 30 years.
   He was greeted at Saddam International Airport by President
Saddam Hussein, and the two rode in an open limousine through
streets lined with thousands of flag-waving people to the Dijlah
government guest house.
   Before opening talks with Saddam, Fahd issued a statment saying,
``We have stood and will continue standing with Iraq in its
attempts to achieve lasting and comprehensive peace and until it
will be capable of continuing its development and construction
plans.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Fahd as saying he would
discuss with Saddam the Palestinian issue, Afghanistan, Lebanon and
Iraq's reconstruction following its eight-year war with Iran.
   Saudi Arabia and most Arab nations backed Arab Iraq in its war
against Persian Iran that began in September 1980. Hostilities
ended with a cease-fire in August.
   Reports in Iraq's government-run news media praised Saudi Arabia
for its support during the war. It is believed the Saudis provided
Iraq with billions of dollars in financial aid and logistical
support.
   Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia ordered that construction
materials be shipped to Iraq's war-battered southern port of Basra.
   Fahd is to travel to Cairo Monday for a four-day visit.
   He last visited Baghdad in 1978, four years before becoming king.

<TEXT>
   Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball's
insurance companies will pay a total of $1.3 million to five
victims of a car wreck that killed two teen-agers and injured six
others last August, the athlete's attorney has announced.
   Attorney James A. Murman said Friday there is ``an agreement in
principle'' to resolve four lawsuits filed against the former U.S.
team diver, who won a silver medal in the 1984 Olympics.
   Kimball's insurers also will give money to an injured youth who
sought compensation but did not file a lawsuit, Murman said.
   Kimball was driving his sports car last Aug. 1 when it sped into
a crowd of youths gathered outside a popular hangout on a rural
road near Brandon, just east of Tampa. He was convicted of
drunken-driving manslaughter and sentenced to 17 years in prison.
   He plans to ask a judge next week to reduce his sentence to a
term of less than 10 years and allow him to be transferred from the
maximum security Tomoka Correctional Institution to a facility
where he can be treated for a ``chemical dependency,'' according to
his criminal defense lawyer, Frank Quesada.
   Meanwhile, attorneys involved in the lawsuits against Kimball
hope to sign the settlement within two weeks, Murman said. They
would not discuss how the money will be divided among the victims
and their families.
   ``It's a fair settlement based on the amount of money and assets
that were available from Mr. Kimball,'' said Clif Curry, a Brandon
attorney who represents two of the victims.
   Murman said he spoke recently with Kimball at the Daytona Beach
prison. The Michigan native wants to put the lawsuits behind him,
his civil lawyer said.
   ``He wanted to be sure the victims were compensated, and it
appears they will be,'' Murman said.
   Those killed in the crash were Robbie Bedell, 19, and Kevin
Gossic, 16. Their families filed wrongful death claims against
Kimball last fall, contending his driving was grossly negligent.
   The parents of April Bruffy, 19, and R.J. Kerker, 17, also sued,
holding Kimball accountable for their children's serious leg
injuries. James Cable, 19, injured an ankle in the crash. He did
not file a lawsuit, but will receive compensation anyway, Murman
said.
   The money will come from Kimball's two insurers, Cincinnati
Insurance Co. and AAA Automobile Club of Michigan Group. Cincinnati
will provide about $1 million and AAA will offer about $300,000,
sources said.

   Thousands of small candles illuminated St.
Peter's Basilica on Saturday night as Pope John Paul II celebrated
Easter vigil services to usher in Christianity's holiest day.
   Before thousands of people packing the pews and aisles of
Christendom's biggest church, the pontiff lit a long white candle
to open the service commemorating the night Jesus Christ rose from
the dead after his crucifixion.
   The cavernous basilica was dark and silent as the pope, preceded
by cardinals and bishops, carried the candle in a slow procession
toward the altar under the Baldacchino, the baroque canopy designed
by the 17th century sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
   After the third chanting of the ``Lumen Christi,'' or Light of
Christ, the basilica slowly lit up as the congregation began
lighting small candles to symbolize the ``pilgrimage from darkness
to light.''
   The pope then placed his candle at the altar, and the lights of
the basilica were turned on.
   After prayers and readings, the pope delivered a homily
stressing the ``natural power of water'' and its role in the
sacrament of baptism.
   The pope then baptized and confirmed 16 people from eight
countries: five each from Japan and the Korean peninsula and one
each from the United States, France, the Philippines, Iran, Italy
and Egypt.
   The American was Curtis Devorn Wilkerson, 26, a surgical
research technician from Joiner, Ark.
   ``In a wonderful way, your baptism and the wait for the
Resurrection of Christ, which will happen tonight, are taking place
at the same time,'' the pope said in his homily, delivered in
Italian.
   ``Let us await the Resurrection of Christ. Let us await the
moment in which the stone will be overturned from the tomb.''
   The Mass lasted nearly two hours. The pope was to celebrate an
open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square Sunday morning, followed by his
``Urbi et Orbi,'' a message to Rome and the world that he was to
deliver at noon from the balcony overlooking the square.
   Earlier Saturday, the Polish-born pope offered Easter greetings
to 300 Poles living in Italy and 250 youths from various countries
belonging to the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic youth
organization.
   Taking advantage of the warm spring weather, tourists from many
countries began lining up early in St. Peter's Square as workers
adorned the basilica steps with yellow, white and orange tulips
from the Netherlands.
   ``When you're surrounded by a group of people sharing an
experience like this, there's nothing that compares to it,'' said
Vincent Damian of New Jersey, a priest in the Marist missionary
order. ``You read a lot about the pageantry and see it on TV, but
there's nothing like being here.''
   The pope presided over several Holy Week ceremonies leading up
to Easter.
   On Friday evening, he carried a simple black wooden cross in a
torchlit procession at the Colosseum. Tens of thousands watched in
person and millions around the world followed on television as the
pope symbolically retraced Christ's path to his crucifixion in
Jerusalem.
   On Thursday, the pope washed the feet of 12 priests in a
ceremony re-enacting Christ's last supper with his apostles.

<HEAD>Wet Weather West Of Rockies, Snow In Maine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A moist Pacific weather system spread showers across most of the
western third of the nation Saturday, and locally heavy snow fell
overnight in Maine.
   Most of California had rain Saturday and rain also fell over
much of the Pacific Northwest and sections of the Intermountain
region between the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
   The heaviest rain fell in northern California, but southern
California also was hit and most of the Los Angeles area received a
steady light rain during the morning, with amounts generally around
a quarter of an inch.
   In California's Sierra Nevada range, over 3 inches of rain fell
during the 24 hours ending at 7 a.m. EST at Blue Canyon and at La
Porte, which got 3.56 inches.
   Precipitation at Blue Canyon changed to snow late in the
morning. Some higher elevations in the northern Sierra Nevada got
around 1 to 2 feet of snow.
   Gusty wind developed over parts of the Southwest during the day
with a gust to 49 mph reported at Cedar City, Calif.
   In the Northeast, much of Maine had heavy snow overnight,
including 11 inches at Lewiston, 8 inches at Augusta, 6 inches at
Rumford, and 4 inches at Portland.
   That snow changed to rain during the morning and most of it
ended by midday. Afternoon temperatures in the upper 30s and 40s
throughout the state melted much of the snow.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over eastern sections of the
Dakotas and western Minnesota. In eastern North Dakota, most of the
precipitation was in the form of snow or sleet.
   Showers spread over northern Michigan, with almost a half-inch
of precipitation at Pellston.
   A flow of air off the Gulf of Mexico brought ashore enough
moisture to produce widely scattered showers over southern Texas.
   Much of the nation had sunshine and mild temperatures and warm
air pushed northward across the Plains, producing noon readings of
68 at Rapid City, S.D.; 69 at Denver, and 71 at Chadron, Neb.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 29
degrees at South Lake Tahoe, Calif., to 88 at Altus Air Force Base,
Okla. Saturday's low in the Lower 48 states was 21 degrees at
Devils Lake, N.D.
   For Sunday, showers were forecast across the West from the
Rockies to the Pacific Coast. Snow showers were forecast in much of
Nevada and the mountains of Arizona. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms were forecast from southern and eastern Texas into
western Louisiana and Arkansas.
   Highs in the 40s and 50s were predicted from the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies, along the Canadian border from
Montana to Michigan, and over most of New York state and New
England; in the 80s from Texas across the central Gulf Coast states
to South Carolina, Georgia and Florida; and in the 60s and 70s
across much of the rest of the nation.

   A Japanese businessmen held captive
for 33 days by officials of a Korean firm in a business dispute is
now under the protection of the Japanese Embassy, police said
Saturday.
   They said Tokuo Osawa, president of the Tokyo-based Osawa Press
Seisakusho machinery company, was released in Seoul Friday and
turned over to the Japanese Embassy.
   Officials at the embassy were not available for comment.
   Osawa, 54, was taken to a hospital for a medical examination and
then tranferred to a Seoul hotel under embassy protection,
according to police.
   ``He is in good health and will be allowed to leave Korea after
an investigation,'' said one Korean official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   He reported Japanese Embassy personnel said Osawa was seized by
officials of the Namil Machine Co. at a Seoul restaurant on Feb. 20
and taken to the Namil plant in Chinchun, 80 miles south of Seoul,
where he was held until Friday.
   Local newspapers said Osawa was released after agreeing to pay
about $385,000 in compensation for allegedly defective machines his
firm sold to Namil last year. They said Osawa's company sold six
machines to Namil for $1.07 million, and that Osawa came to South
Korea after the Korean firm complained that the machines did not
operate correctly.
   A spokesman at Osawa's company in Tokyo said Osawa had been held
by Namil officials for several days in December but was freed
because of actions by the Japanese Embassy and Korean police.
   He said that after Osawa was released in December, he was not
allowed to leave South Korea because of a lawsuit filed by Namil.

   Police are searching for a hospital employee who
claims he planted the fake bomb intended for reputed organized
crime boss John Gotti, officers said Saturday.
   The employee, Michael McCray, called WCBS-TV in New York to say
he is waging a war against drugs and to claim responsibility for
leaving the device outside a Little Italy social club, said Barbara
Nevins, a correspondent at the station.
   She said she met the 37-year-old New York man Wednesday in
Pittsburgh, where he stopped while driving west, a day after he
called the TV station. WCBS reported the story Friday.
   Police consider McCray a suspect and are trying to locate him
for questioning, police Sgt. Maurice Howard said Saturday.
   Nevins said police believe that only the person who built the
fake bomb could describe in as much detail as McCray did.
   However, Howard would not confirm whether McCray is the chief
suspect in the case or if he had provided convincing detail about
the device.
   The fake bomb, a plastic box containing salt and gunpowder, was
found Monday after an anonymous caller told police a ``gift'' for
Gotti had been left at the Ravenite Social Club, where police
suspect Gotti conducts mob business.
   Nevins said McCray told her he was ``fed up with drugs and drug
dealers'' and that he ``wanted to send a message to John Gotti.''
He said he had written several letters to Gotti warning him to get
out of the drug trade.
   McCray told Nevins he is aware Gotti had never been charged with
drug-related crimes.
   McCray is a medical photographer at North Shore University
Hospital in Manhasset, according to Dan Rosett, a spokesman for the
hospital. He said he did not know when McCray would return to work,
but that he was ``an employee of the hospital as of Friday.''
   A friend of McCray described him as ``a sincere and concerned
person who gets very involved in causes,'' according to Nevins. He
said he feels he's on a crusade against drugs and thought he would
get attention for his cause with the incident, according to Nevins.

<HEAD>Mahdi's New Sudanese `Peace' Cabinet Sworn In</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with all new Cabinet ministers sworn
in. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The broad-based ``peace'' Cabinet of
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi was sworn in Saturday shortly after
the State Council, Sudan's collective presidency, endorsed all 23
candidates.
   The Cabinet included almost all the nation's political groups as
well as the powerful trade unions.
   The fundamentalist National Islamic Front, however, boycotted
the new government for adopting a program calling for suspending
Islamic law as a prelude for making peace with the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
   The rebel army now seems to have the upper hand in the south.
Its forces have captured major garrison towns in the last few
months.
   Relief agencies blame Sudan's six-year civil war for
contributing to famine in the south that U.N. officials say killed
500,000 people last year.
   Saturday's swearing-in ended a political crisis that had
confronted Mahdi since January. The Democratic Unionist Party, a
partner in his Cabinet, resigned then to protest Mahdi's refusal to
endorse a peace agreement the party signed Nov. 16 with the
Liberation Army.
   Under a program signed by Mahdi and 65 heads of political
parties and unions, the new government will immediately endorse the
Nov. 16 accord. It will eventually hold a national constitutional
conference with all powers in Sudan participating, including the
rebels, to end the war.
   Mahdi offered his Cabinet's resignation two weeks ago, bowing to
pressure from the military, political parties and trade and
professional unions for a widely representative government that
would begin peace talks with the rebels.
   Many of the new ministers served in previous governments.
   The defense post went to an independent, retired Gen. Mubarak
Osaman Rahma, who has served as a diplomat in Moscow and Eastern
Europe.
   Eight ministries went to Mahdi's centrist Umma party; six to the
centrist Democratic Unionists; four to the southern parties; two to
the unions; one to leftists; one to the western Sudan National
Party and one to an independent.
   Mahdi became prime minister in 1986, a year after the military
overthrew President Gaafar Nimeiri and then handed power to the
civilians after general elections.
   Rebels in the mainly Christian and animist south took up arms
against the Arab Moslem majority government in the north in 1983.
They demand more autonomy as well as economic and administrative
reforms.

<HEAD>Senator Agrees To Settle Election Dispute, Pay $30,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, announced Saturday
his 1984 campaign committee has agreed to pay a $30,000 penalty to
settle a 5-year dispute with the Federal Election Commission.
   Although errors made by his first Senate campaign committee were
``unintended and in no way benefitted the campaign ... they were
errors,'' Gramm said.
   ``The FEC does not contend that anyone in the campaign committee
consciously sought to violate any FEC reporting requirement and the
committee is now in total compliance. They were technical reporting
errors and they in no way benefitted my campaign,'' said Gramm, who
intends to seek re-election in 1990.
   In a statement, Gramm said he rejected suggestions that he take
the FEC to court to fight the penalty as ``unfair and unjustified''
because a lawsuit would cost many times the $30,000 penalty.
   Donald R. White, treasurer of the ``Friends of Phil Gramm'' 1984
Senate campaign committee, said the FEC accused the group of
failure to make timely reports and failure to supply adequate
documentation of campaign contributions.
   According to White, the FEC questioned the campaign's handling
of contributions from husbands and wives on joint checking
accounts. The FEC has found that $15,000 of $690,000 in potentially
excess contributions was outside the limit of $1,000 per person,
per election.
   After the committee provided documentation on the questionable
contributions, the FEC decided $675,000 was within the limits. The
remaining $15,000 will be donated to charity, White said.
   Also, the FEC questioned whether the campaign fully reported
primary debts, which White said were accurate, although most of the
debt had not been billed to the campaign by the time original
reports were to have been filed. The FEC also determined that
$9,708 in corporate funds were erroneously accepted. The money has
been refunded, White said.
   The FEC complained that contributor identification data such as
addresses and job title were not always available in a timely
manner and not all funds were deposited within 10 days of receipt.
White said both assertions were correct in ``scattered'' instances,
and that complete information on each contributor was provided to
the FEC.
   Finally, the FEC complained that the campaign overpaid its share
of a joint fund-raiser at the 1984 Republican National Convention
in Dallas. White said a campaign audit found the complaint to be
accurate and has agreed to seek a $506 reimbursement from the only
remaining co-host, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
   Two other co-hosts, the Texas Victory '84 Fund and the
Republican Host Committee, have been disbanded.
   ``In no way did the failure to obtain written allocation of
funds on joint checking accounts, the failure to report debt in the
primary, the overpayment of the committee's share of fund-raising
costs or any other reporting error in any way benefit the Gramm
campaign,'' White said.
   ``The plain truth is that a flood of 70,000 individual
contributions defeated the efforts of our volunteer campaign
workers to adequately screen and process the incoming mail,'' he
said.
   Gramm said his 1990 re-election committee will be staffed by a
professional team of certified public accountants, attorneys and
managers ``to assure that the problems of the 1984 campaign reports
never occur again.''

<HEAD>Former Jordanian Prime Minister Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Al-Mufti, a former Jordanian prime minister
who helped lead his country to become an independent kingdom, died
on Saturday, state-run Jordan Television reported.
   The report gave no details, including where Mufti died, the
cause of death or his age.
   Mufti was one of Jordan's most prominent citizens throughout the
country's 68-year history as an emirate under British protection
and later as an independent monarchy.
   A strong nationalist, he balked at the 1928 constitutional
agreement with Britain, claiming it gave Britain too much say in
Jordan's affairs. Britain was responsible for Jordan under a League
of Nations mandate. Jordan became an independent monarchy in 1946.
   As prime minister from April to December 1950, Mufti opposed
King Abdullah's negotiations with Israel.
   During his second term as prime minister in 1956, Mufti
expressed reservations about the Baghdad Pact, a U.S.-backed plan
to create a belt of anti-communist nations from Turkey to Iran.
   He was a major figure in the regency council that governed
Jordan between the abdication of King Talal in 1952 and the 1953
accession of King Hussein, then a teen-ager.
   Mufti was leader of Jordan's small community of Circassians, who
had emigrated to Jordan from the Russian empire in the 19th century
and who became a bedrock of support for the current Hashemite
monarchy.
   He served repeatedly in Jordanian cabinets from 1929 until the
early 1960s, often as deputy prime minister and as interior
minister.
   One of Mufti's sons, Azmi Al-Mufti, was assassinated in 1985
while serving as ambassador to Greece. Jordanian diplomats at the
time were targets of a wave of terrorist attacks by Syrian-backed
Palestinian factions opposed to Hussein's efforts to reach peace
with Israel.

   The Middle East landscape is vastly and
dramatically changed since Israel and Egypt signed their historic
peace treaty a decade ago. Palestinian Arabs are in revolt and
their cause is being promoted with the Bush administration by
nations around the world.
   Four key American players at the time and a former special U.S.
mediator all agree that the treaty has served the cause of peace in
the troubled Middle East.
   ``It changed the map of the Middle East and, to a degree, its
political climate,'' says Cyrus R. Vance, who was secretary of
state when Egypt and Israel decided to turn from war to peace.
   ``It established a precedent and provided a foundation on which
one can still build,'' says Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was former
President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser in those parlous
days.
   ``The good news is the treaty has lasted,'' says William Quandt,
who was the National Security Council's Mideast specialist.
   ``It's a framework that has really held up,'' says Harold
Saunders, who headed the Near East bureau at the State Department.
   ``The dramatic fact is not a single Israeli or Egyptian soldier
has been killed on that border since the treaty went into effect,''
says Sol Linowitz, who subsequently served as Carter's special
emissary to the Middle East.
   But all five, interviewed separately for the 10th anniversary of
the treaty, registered impatience and disappointment with what the
consider to be a lack of accomplishment in the years since.
   They hope President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III will recapture the spirit and drive of Camp David and apply it
to Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, thousands of whom are in
rebellion on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   For 11 exhausting days to September 17, 1978 Carter shuttled
between the cabins of the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and
then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin mountains and cajoled them into a
peace accord that took the largest and most powerful Arab country
out of the conflict with Israel.
   The treaty, which also required Israel, the victor in the 1967
Six-Day War, to return all captured territory to Egypt, the
vanquished, needed more than Carter's heavy lifting at Camp David
to be nailed down. He had to go to the Middle East and keep Sadat
and Begin from flying apart again.
   It was a high-wire act, but it worked.
   Israel would like a warmer relationship from Egypt _ more trade,
tourism and the other trappings of friendship. Egypt would like
Israel to give up the rest of the land the Arabs lost in 1967. But
they are at peace.
   Vance, who negotiated several of the key provisions of the
treaty with the late Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan, said
from his New York law office: ``It has prevented another war
between Israel and its neighbors, and it has laid the first stones
for a just and enduring peace.''
   But Vance quickly added: ``I think the question we have to ask
ourselves now is how can we breath new life into the peace
process.''
   He suggested three ways:
   __ By demonstrating a willingness to try again, starting with
confidence-building measures.
   __ By being willing to engage in creative, fresh thinking __
``and a willingness to think the unthinkable.''
   __ By the parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict ``putting
themselves in the shoes of the person across the table.''
   Specifically, Vance said the time has come for direct talks
between Israel and the Palestinians _ including the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``I still believe peace is possible,'' he said. ``But it's going
to take courage and great political will on the part of all
involved.''
   Vance doesn't mean only Arabs and Israelis. He also means the
United States.
   ``I think the United States has a clear and important role to
play, and I hope that the United States will put the Middle East
question on its agenda,'' he said. ``I have seen some recent signs
of this.''
   Brzezinski, who sometimes disagreed with Vance on other policy
issues when they served under Carter, voiced similar views in in a
separate interview from his Washington office.
   He called the treaty ``a partial success,'' but also ``a partial
failure'' and said ``the failure is obviously the absence of
progress on the West Bank issue.''
   The Camp David agreement, which established the outline for the
peace treaty, called for five years of autonomy for the
Palestinians on the Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza. Afterward,
all options including statehood were to be open for negotiations.
   Brzezinski said the Palestinians have grown stronger since 1979.
He said the transitional period should be shortened and it should
lead to ``some form of statehood.''
   And that, he said, means Israel negotiating directly with the
PLO.
   Baker seems to be taking the first few steps in that direction.
He has not broken off U.S. talks with the PLO despite several
guerrilla attempts at infiltrating Israel. He has stressed his aim
is to bring Israelis and Palestinians together. And he has said
that might require Israel talking to the PLO.
   Quandt, a scholar who met recently with Chairman Yasser Arafat
and other PLO officials, said he had ``nothing against the notion
that incremental steps are valuable.''
   But, he said, events in the Middle East are accelerating.
``Israelis understand they are going to have to make a deal with
the Palestinians.'' Quandt said. ``And I think the Palestinians are
willing to talk to Israel, as it is.''
   Quandt summed up: ``I think we are in sight of Israeli-PLO
negotiations.''
   Saunders, like Quandt a Mideast scholar at the Brookings
Institution, offered this curbstone advice: ``A strong involvement
by the president and secretary of state is going to be necessary.
It's taken a lot of time for Egyptians and Israelis to learn to
talk to each other.
   ``The Israeli-Palestinian relationship today is a lot more fully
developed. Once they get together they are going to be able to do
more on their own than was in the case of Egypt and Israel.''
   Linowitz, who tried to build on the peace treaty as Carter's
Mideast envoy from late 1979 until the onset of the Reagan
administration in 1981, puts a lot of the blame for a lack of
progress on the West Bank and Gaza since the treaty on ``the
unwillingness of the United States to take real leadership.''
   He said he had urged Alexander M. Haig Jr., who had taken over
as secretary of state, to appoint a special emissary ``to pick up
the negotiations where they then were'' on the Palestinian issue.
   Linowitz said he thought at the time ``if that were done it
would be possible to have a treaty by May of 1981.``
   But, he said, ``the administration wanted to take its time, and
valuable time was lost.''

   A gunman on Saturday killed a Sikh who was
among scores of other people outside the Jammu-Kashmir state High
Court, police reported.
   Police Superintendent Jaswant Singh said 55-year-old Kalyan
Singh was shot by a man in his early 20s who escaped in the crowded
street in front of the court building.
   Police said they had not determined the motive for the killing
but that there might be a connection between the killer and Sikh
extremists in Punjab state, just south of Jammu-Kashmir.
   The courts were in session when the shooting occurred and some
were hearing cases involving Sikh militants from Punjab.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a bloody campaign since 1982
for the creation of an independent Sikh state in Punjab.
   The Sikh separatists claim Hindus discriminate against Sikhs.
   Sikhs slightly outnumber Hindus in Punjab, but they make up only
2 percent of India's overall population; Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   An avalanche crushed a family's mountain
ski cabin in southwestern Norway Saturday, killing a woman and
burying six others, police said.
   A 4-year-old girl, buried under the snow for more than two
hours, was hospitalized in critical condition, officials said. The
other survivors, including an infant, were located quickly and were
not seriously hurt, said Rogaland police Officer Leif Helge
Eskeland.
   ``It appears the entire family was in the cabin when the
avalanche hit,'' Eskeland said. Police would not identify the
seven, who were on an Easter skiing vacation.
   The avalanche swept through a popular winter cabin complex about
30 miles east of the city of Stavanger. It destroyed one cottage
and damaged another, said Red Cross spokesman Morten Halgunset.
   The Red Cross also reported that a 25-year-old Danish mountain
climber was killed Friday when he fell from one of Norway's
steepest mountain faces at Mount Kapelltind near Tromsoe in
northern Norway.
   His climbing partners reached help Saturday afternoon and a
rescue helicopter recovered the body, said the Norwegian news
agency NTB. Police would not identify the victim until his
relatives had been notified.

<UNK>Newspaper Says Greens Party Member Linked to Libyan Lobby Group</UNK>

<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Saturday that a
member of Parliament from the ecological Greens party has links to
a Libyan-financed foundation. Party leaders said they would
investiate the allegations.
   The Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Alfred Mechtersheimer
was involved with the M.A.G. Foundation for Peace and Solidarity
based in Vaduz, Liechstenstein. It said the foundation was financed
by a $10 million account set up in Switzerland by Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Mechtersheimer was quoted by the newspaper as saying he did not
have a special role with the foundation but acted ``as a kind of
adviser.''
   Antje Vollmer, a Greens spokeswoman, said a party meeting might
be convened to discuss the allegation.
   She said Greens leaders want to know more about the extent of
Mechtersheimer's connections to the foundation, who heads the
foundation and its purpose.
   Mechtersheimer could not be reached for comment Saturday.
   The newspaper quoted Mechtersheimer as saying the foundation was
set up to promote the ``new thinking'' in Libya.
   He said it was important that Libya not be isolated ``like the
Americans would have it'' and that efforts should be made to
``bring Libya closer to the world community,'' according to the
newspaper.
   It said he acknowledged that the M.A.G. in the title represents
Gadhafi's initials.
   The United States has accused the Gadhafi regime of supporting
international terrorism.

   A man and a child drowned Saturday,
bringing the death toll to at least 15 in a week of flash floods
following torrential rains in Hadramaut Valley, according to
reports reaching Aden.
   Travelers from Hadramaut province, about 400 miles from the
capital, said roads were blocked and water and power supplies
disrupted by the storms.
   Information Minister Mohammed Jarhoum was quoted Saturday in the
Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat as saying ``damage is
very high.''
   ``The floods have swept away dozens of people, and a number of
entire villages, leaving tens of thousands homeless ... The first
day of the floods (Wednesday) alone left more than 50,000
destitute,'' he said.
   State-run Aden radio said Thursday that 154 houses and four
schools were destroyed in the Tarim region of the province, which
borders the Gulf of Aden.
   It referred to vast amounts of land and crops being washed away,
but made no mention of casualties.
   South Yemen's neighbors have begun relief shipments. King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia on Friday ordered the immediate dispatch of four
planeloads of tents, blankets, food and medical supplies to the
affected areas.
   The United Arab Emirates also sent relief supplies.

   Randall Dale Adams has little chance of getting
compensated for his 12{-year imprisonment and near-execution for a
police murder he didn't commit because Texas law protects his
prosecutors, experts say.
   ``Even if there's out and out misconduct ... even if he (the
prosecutor) lied ... you can't sue the prosecutor,'' Dallas civil
rights attorney Doug Larson said.
   Adams was freed last week after his conviction was overturned.
New evidence brought out in the film ``The Thin Blue Line'' had
strongly suggested that another man committed the killing.
   Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer, said he hasn't discussed the
possibility of a lawsuit with his client, who has returned home to
Columbus, Ohio. But if Adams agrees, Schaffer said he has some
ideas.
   ``What I might do is sue (former Assistant District Attorney
Doug) Mulder and challenge him to waive any claim of prosecutorial
immunity,'' Schaffer said. ``If Doug Mulder feels that his conduct
was defensible, I challenge him to waive immunity and try this
matter on the merits.''
   ``On the other hand, if he concedes his conduct was illegal,
unethical and dishonest, then I invite him to invoke prosecutorial
immunity as a defense.''
   Schaffer said he also intends to ask the Texas Legislature to
authorize good-will compensation for Adams, who spent 12{ years in
prison and at one point was only three days away from being
executed for the slaying. His sentence was later commuted to life
imprisonment.
   Adams would not be the only Texas victim of wrongful conviction
unable to receive redress.
   Lenell Geter, who served 16 months of a life sentence after he
was wrongfully convicted of a 1982 robbery, saw his $8.2 million
federal lawsuit claiming civil rights violations dismantled last
year. Marvin Maurice Wells, whose 1986 capital murder trial was
halted when prosecutors found the right man, last year lost his
$6.5 million federal suit against the police.
   Randy Ty Senegar, who was imprisoned for 14 months after a 1986
rape victim mistakenly identified him as her masked attacker,
didn't even try to win compensation. His attorney, Roger Joyner,
told him Texas law made no provision for it.
   In fact, Joyner suggested that Senegar's case would be ruled
``frivolous,'' clearing the way for the state to sue him.
   Witnesses also are immune from lawsuits because the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that the threat of a lawsuit could prevent people
from testifying. The judge and jury are protected too.

   An Indiana prison escapee and his female
accomplice, both suspected in an interstate crime spree, were
arrested and hospitalized Saturday after being chased by a wounded
police officer, authorities said.
   Both suspects were listed in critical condition at St. Luke's
Hospital in Racine from complications due to apparent drug
overdoses, officials said.
   Officers found Ronald R. Plummer, 39, and Elizabeth C.
Bonvillian, 31, hiding in a barn about 7 a.m., said Racine County
Sheriff's Deputy Kenneth Sowinski.
   ``They were found buried between straw in a box stall in the
barn,'' Sowinski said. ``Both appeared to be under the influence of
drugs so they were transported to a hospital for treatment.''
   A hospital spokesman said their condition worsened after their
arrival at the hospital. In addition, a police dog bit Plummer when
he refused to come out of hiding, authorities said.
   Sowinski said authorities suspect the two were involved in a
series of crimes that began Friday with Plummer's escape and a
hostage incident in Indianapolis and included an armed robbery in
Illinois and the shooting of the Oak Creek officer.
   Plummer, serving a federal prison term for bank robberies in
Ohio, had been in Indianapolis for a trial and awaiting sentencing
in another case. He escaped with Bonvillian's help when he was
taken from jail to a hospital emergency room, authorities said.
   They apparently were asleep early Saturday in a car parked just
south of Milwaukee when patrolman John Edwards stopped to check the
car. According to police reports, Plummer allegedly drew a gun and
shot Edwards in one hand before speeding away.
   Edwards gave chase but lost them. Their car was found a while
later in a private driveway and police dogs tracked the pair to the
barn.

<TEXT>
   An extremist Palestinian faction financed by
Iranian radicals is alleged to have carried out the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103, and U.S. intelligence knows where the bombers are,
The Sunday Times of London reported.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in Washington, said
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
made and planted the bomb on behalf of Iranians seeking revenge for
the U.S. Navy downing of an Iranian civilian jetliner over the
Persian Gulf on July 3. All 290 people on board the Iranian plane
were killed.
   The newspaper quoted one source as saying the Palestinian group
was paid $10 million to destroy the New York-bound Pan Am jumbo
jet, which broke apart over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
   The group has been linked to the bombing in previous newspaper
accounts.
   The organization is led by Ahmed Jibril, a Palestine Liberation
Organization renegade who opposes PLO chief Yasser Arafat's drive
for peace negotiations with Israel.
   The Sunday Times said senior PLO officials also are convinced,
after months of their own inquiries, that Jibril's faction planted
the bomb at the bidding of unidentified Iranian radicals.
   It said U.S. intelligence has informed all Western intelligence
services involved in the hunt ``of the exact whereabouts of the
Jibril bombers'' and ``plans are being made to capture the men and
bring them to trial in America.''
   It gave no indication of the whereabouts of the alleged bombers.
   At the State Department in Washington, spokeswoman Sondra
McCarty said Saturday night, ``I have nothing on that at all.''
   The Sunday Times said 14 of Jibril's men were arrested in
October in Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated,
with arms, plastic explosives and a bomb similar to the radio
cassette device used in the Pan Am bombing.
   U.S. officials have said the Iranian airliner was shot down by
the USS Vincennes in the gulf when the ship mistook it for an
attacking warplane.
   Another London weekly, The Observer, reported Sunday that police
officers escorting top politicians and members of the royal family
are being allowed to carry loaded guns onto British aircraft under
new security regulations revised after the Pan Am disaster.
   Previously, such security personnel were permitted only to take
unloaded firearms onto aircraft, the newspaper said.
   It said the new Civil Aviation Authority regulations were found
in a leaked copy of a restricted report on Flight 103 by the
government's National Aviation Security Committee.
   It quoted the Dec. 29-dated committee report as saying that hold
baggage of passengers who transferred from the first leg of Flight
103 aboard a Boeing 707 from Frankfurt to London was transferred to
the New York-bound Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport without
being screened.

   Shareholders of Recruit Co., the firm at the center
of a stock-profiteering and bribery scandal, voted Saturday to
slash executives' salaries, company spokesman Yasutaka Natsuka
reported.
   He said they also voted to deny retirement pay to the firm's
founder and former chairman, Hiromasa Ezoe.
   About 30 major shareholders of the employment-information
conglomerate, including company president Naotaka Ida, held a
general meeting at the firm's Tokyo headquarters to atone for any
company wrongdoing, said Natsuka.
   The scandal involves selling hundreds of thousands of unlisted
shares in Recruit Cosmos, Recruit's real estate susidiary, to
political and business figures at discount prices before the shares
were listed in the over-the-counter market. The shares soared in
value after trading began, reaping large profits for the recipients.
   News reports said the shareholders agreed to reduce Recruit
executives' monthly pay by up to 50 percent, with Ida's salary cut
in half. They said the shareholders decided to let Ida stay on as
president at least for now while prosecutors pursue their
investigations.
   Prosecutors have questioned Ida about possible bribes to Labor
Ministry officials in the scandal which has shaken the
administration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Ezoe and 11 other senior executives and government bureaucrats
were arrested on suspicion of offering or taking bribes.

   Democratic Party officials selected a state
senator Saturday to run for the U.S. House seat left vacant by
newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.
   Sen. John Vinich defeated opponents Bill Downes, a Casper
attorney, and former state tax commissioner Carrol Orrison to earn
the right to face Republican nominee Craig Thomas, a state
representative in his third term, in the April 26 special election.
   Vinich, who received 49 or the 66 votes cast during the meeting
of the state party's central committee, said the state needs
someone to make its concerns known to the Democrats in Congress.
   ``Rather than being on the outside complaining about the
decisions of the majority party, I will be directly involved and
have the opportunity to speak out on western issues,'' he told
central committee members. ``The majority party has some members
with senseless ideas and no understanding of the West.''
   Cheney, a six-term Republican congressman, gave up the seat less
than two weeks ago when he was confirmed as defense secretary by
the U.S. Senate.

   Greeks on Saturday celebrated the 168th

Turks' Ottoman Empire.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou and President Christos Sartzetakis
attended a Greek Orthodox church service and later joined Cabinet
members, political party leaders and foreign diplomats to watch a
parade of military units and a flyover by Greece's newly purchased

   Parades and celebrations were held in towns and cities

   The fight for independence began March 25, 1821, when Greek
Orthodox Bishop Germanos raised the blue-and-white Greek flag in
rebellion at the Aghia Lavra monastery in southern Greece. The
nation won independence in 1830.

   An Amtrak passenger train slammed into a
flat-bed truck loaded with steel at a crossing Saturday, injuring
more than 20 people, authorities and witnesses said.
   The accident occurred shortly before 11 a.m. as the truck driver
tried to go around lowered crossing gates and collided with the
train, sending 13-ton coils of steel flying. There were 43
passengers and four crew members aboard the train.
   Eleven people, including two train crew members and the driver
of the truck, were treated for minor injuries and released from two
Trenton hospitals, officials said.
   About a dozen passengers on the train were treated at the scene,
said Capt. Ken Gorno of the Trenton Fire Department.
   The train, named the Lake Cities, originated in Toledo, Ohio and
was headed to Detroit, 15 miles north of Trenton, when it struck
the truck between the cab and the flat-bed portion, officials said.
   ``It sounded like somebody blew off a stick of dynamite,'' said
David Jones, 21, of Taylor.
   Jones said he was waiting at the crossing when the truck
attempted to pass around crossing gates that were being lowered.
The signals at the crossing were on, witnesses said.
   Conductor Gary L. Wilkins said the train was traveling at 50
mph, the legal limit in the area.
   Donald Hoppe, 58, of Livonia, was taking the train home with his
wife, Dorothy, after a trip to New York.
   ``I thought somebody had bombed this train,'' Hoppe said.
``That's why we took the train, because we're afraid to fly.''
   After the crash, ``everyone was very calm,'' passenger Linda
Thomas, 37, of East Rochester, N.Y., traveling with two 11-year-old
daughters. ``Everyone on the train was so helpful.''
   The truck was leased to Hawkins Steel Cartage of Southgate,
officials said. Janise Hawkins, a part owner of the company, said
she could not identify the driver and could not confirm or deny the
eyewitness accounts of the accident.
   She said the truck was hauling the coils of steel between two
steel plants in the area.
   Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said the railway company was
investigating the accident and had not decided whether to seek
charges against the truck driver. But, she said, ``In the past we
have taken action in similar situations.''
   Damage to the locomotive was estimated at $100,000, Martin said.
It was moved to a nearby siding while another locomotive took the
four passenger cars to Detroit, she said.
   Amtrak provided passengers who did not require hospital
treatment with free bus transportation to stops along the Lake
Cities' route, including Detroit, Dearborn, Jackson, all in
Michigan, and Chicago, Martin said.

<HEAD>FTC Charges Rales Brothers Skirted Merger Rules in Interco Takeover
Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission is pushing for
the forfeiture of an estimated $75 million in profits made by
brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales in their unsuccessful drive to
acquire Interco, Inc., last year, according to published reports.
   Accounts in The Washington Post and FTC: Watch, a private
newsletter, said three of the commission's five members have asked
the Justice Department to take the two Washington entrepreneurs to
court over their alleged failure to comply with merger notification
requirements.
   The Post said the three commissioners hope to make an example of
the Raleses in a bid to keep secret takeover artists frmom thumbing
their noses at the comparatively paltry civil fines which the FTC
is empowered to level by itself.
   FTC and Justice Department officials declined to discuss the
case Saturday. ``I can neither confirm nor deny that such a
petition has been sent'' to the department said FTC spokeswoman
Susan Ticknor.
   At issue is whether the Rales brothers should have informed the
FTC sooner last year that they had acquired more than $15 million
worth of stock in Interco, a St. Louis consumer goods conglomerate.
The Post said the comissioners charged that the Rales eclipsed the
trigger holdings last May, but didn't serve notice until Nov. 10.
   The Post said that when the Rales brothers, who control more
that 20 companies, retreated from the Interco bid, they sold their
stock at an estimated $75 million profit. If the FTC leveled its
maximum fine of $10,000 per day, they would pay an estimated $3.8
million, still leaving them more than $70 million ahead, the
newspaper said.
   FTC Commissioner Terry Calvani, while declining to discuss the
Rales case, said the civil fine is ``totally inadequate'' to deter
acquisitive corporations and individuals from engineering their
takeover gambits in the dark. ``If a company can save or make $30
million by paying a $300,000 fine,'' he said, ``it's going to cut
that penalty check quickly.''
   The brothers and their attorneys declined to discuss FTC's
reported request that the Justice Department sue for the
``disgorgement'' of all their profits from the sales of Interco
stock. But the Post said they had taken the position that the
notification delay was perfectly legal, and, moreover, were
protected by a provision in the law that exempts partnerships from
the reporting requirement if no investor controls more than 50
percent of the partnership. Each of the Rales owned 49 percent of
the group which bid for Interco.
   With virtually no precedent for such a disgorgement case, it was
unclear who might get the money even if the Justice Department and
the courts side with the FTC. Ms. Ticknor said returning the
profits to Interco shareholders was one possibility _ or ``it might
just go to the U.S. Treasury.''

<TEXT>
   The spokesman for deposed Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos and 14 other Marcos supporters face possible
deportation by the U.S. government, with a preliminary hearing on
the first four cases scheduled for Monday, officials said.
   Ronald Oldenburg, the attorney for Marcos spokesman Gemmo
Trinidad, claimed Friday the hearings were an attempt ``to isolate
and to some extent harass the Marcos group and intimidate them into
incriminating Mr. Marcos.''
   But William Craig, Hawaii district director for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, said the government routinely reviews
the status of aliens to determine whether they are maintaining the
status by which they entered the United States.
   ``If there is no reason to be here any longer, we can request
that they depart. That's all there is to it,'' Craig said.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are under U.S. indictment for
allegedly plundering their homeland of more than $100 million and
stashing much of the money in the United States.
   Monday's preliminary hearing was scheduled via telephone with a
federal immigration judge in San Diego.
   Oldenburg said the supporters involved were not part of the
initial group that accompanied Marcos from the Philippines to
Hawaii in February 1986. Those people were granted parole status by
the Reagan administration.
   Trinidad, for example, entered the United States a few months
later with a six-month tourist visa and was allowed to stay after
it expired, Oldenburg said.
   ``If this is not an effort to in some way isolate the Marcoses,
why was he (Trinidad) allowed to remain almost three years and
suddenly now they issue a deportation action?'' Oldenburg asked.
   Trinidad's phone was disconnected, and The Associated Press was
unable to contact him through Marcos' residence Saturday.
   Marcos has been in St. Francis Medical Center since Jan. 15 for
treatment of heart and lung ailments. He was listed in guarded
condition Saturday.

<HEAD>Easter Loads Reportedly Very Light; Judge to Reconsider Pilots Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passenger loads on strikebound Eastern Airline's
Northeast shuttle were extremely light entering the busy Easter
weekend travel period as the carrier ended a cut-rate ticket
promotion, the pilots union said Saturday.
   The average number of passengers carried Friday on the shuttle
linking Boston, New York and Washington was between 25 and 35,
according to an Air Line Pilots Association news release. On
Thursday, Eastern flew 60 shuttle flights, with some carrying as
few as three or four passengers, the release said.
   Most of Eastern's 3,600 pilots, along with flight attendants,
have refused to cross picket lines as the Machinists strike against
the airline entered its fourth week Saturday.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline does not
release passenger-load figures specifically for the shuttle,
although it had a monthly traffic report for all its flights.
   But she said the holiday weekend was not a peak time for the
shuttle, which caters to business travelers, and loads had been
light ever since the strike started March 4.
   ``We're running a good reliable product in the shuttle,'' Ms.
Ceremsak said. ``It's a shame that an organization that claims to
be professional like ALPA is busy trying to drive a stake through
the heart of a great airline.''
   The Miami-based carrier on Friday raised ticket prices to their
original $99 daily and $69 weekend one-way fares after cutting
fares to as low as $12.
   Meanwhile, a Miami judge scheduled a hearing Monday on Eastern's
request to order the pilots back to work.
   On Friday, a three-judge appeals panel ordered U.S. District
Judge Edward Davis in Miami to determine if the walkout by pilots
is a sympathy strike or a de facto strike to press their own
contract demands. Davis earlier had refused to issue a ruling,
saying he lacked authority.
   ``The claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used a a pretext to
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the
Railway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.
   Davis could order the pilots back to work if he finds they
called a strike over their own contract demands without having
exhausted all collective bargaining options required under the
Railway Labor Act.
   Three weeks after Eastern's 8,500-member Machinists union
struck, the airline continues operating just a small fraction of
its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 flights. The carrier is presently
operating only its Northeast shuttle and Latin American routes
while it attempts to rebuild under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The trustee of the New York bankruptcy court that is hearing the
Eastern case next week will appoint an examiner who will have the
dual role of investigator and mediator.
   ``I think this is an examiner who has all the authority except
for operating the business,'' said Harry Jones, the court trustee
in New York.
   The examiner will, among other things, probe union allegations
that Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent, damaged the carrier by
stripping it of assets such as its reservations systems, planes and
various routes and airport facilities.
   The examiner also could become involved with Eastern's union
contracts in an attempt to remove obstacles to the carrier's
rebuilding plans.
   ``It's conceivable he could come back and say the parties are at
an impasse,'' said Harvey Miller, Eastern's bankruptcy lawyer. ``He
could come back and say Texas Air is irresponsible, or the unions
are irresponsible.''
   Meanwhile, disappointed band members at two Cincinnati high
schools hoped to recover $30,900 they deposited with a Miami travel
agency that canceled their trip to Mexico because of the strike.
   Sixty-eight students from the suburban Greenhills and Forest
Park high schools, along with 17 parents and teachers, staged
fund-raisers for the concert trip to Merida, Mexico, during the
spring school break.
   The owner of the travel firm has apparently agreed to return the
money.

   Hundreds of abortion foes capped an Easter
Week crusade Saturday by blockading a women's clinic in defiance of
a federal court order, and police in riot gear arrested more than
700 of them as they clashed with counterprotesters.
   The 6{-hour demonstration held in heavy rain was the largest in
a series of protests designed to focus attention on the Supreme
Court's reconsideration of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   Some 300 officers on foot and horseback moved in on the more
than 800 anti-abortion activists who blocked the Family Planning
Associates clinic. Most of those arrested were cited for
trespassing and released, but some were sent to jails on more
serious charges.
   ``We look forward to the day that you have to arrest the
murderers,'' Randall Terry, founder of the national Operation
Rescue anti-abortion group, shouted through a bullhorn before he,
too, was carried away by police.
   Pro-choice leaders mobilized hundreds of supporters in
coordinated counter-demonstrations that helped nullify the
protesters' aim of shutting down women's health clinics throughout
Southern California.
   ``We are here today to celebrate the defeat of Operation
Persecute,'' pro-choice leader Dady Blake told a gathering at
Patriotic Hall at the end of the day.
   Police slipped nylon handcuffs on the anti-abortion protesters,
who fell limp to the ground and had to be dragged to waiting blue
and white police buses. Pro-choice activists cheered as each bus
pulled away.
   Most were arrested for investigation of trespassing, blocking
entrances or interfering with police _ misdemeanor charges that
result in a citation and quick release. The total number of arrests
was 725, said Capt. Sid Mills.
   Mills said four _ including Terry _ were arrested for
investigation of conspiracy to encourage others to commit a crime,
a felony.
   Chief Daryl F. Gates said he would urge the city attorney to sue
Operation Rescue for the $60,000 to $100,000 the police operation
had cost the city.
   More than 900 people had already been arrested Thursday and
Friday during protests elsewhere in southern California and in
Philadelphia, Alexandria, Va., Albany and Syracuse, N.Y., and other
cities. Additional, smaller protests took place elsewhere around
the country Saturday.
   Word had leaked out that the demonstration target would be
Family Planning Associates, in the mid-city area, and pro-choice
advocates had surrounded the clinic when the protesters from
Operation Rescue arrived about 7 a.m.
   ``It shows that they're certainly outnumbered in the public and
in the opinion polls,'' said Kathy Spillar, an organizer of the
pro-choice group.
   Hundreds of riot-helmeted officers moved in on foot just before
9 a.m. and police began ordering the demonstrators to clear a path
to the clinic door to comply with a federal court order.
   A clinic receptionist said abortions scheduled for the day were
canceled when patients couldn't get in. She said patients were
referred to other offices of Family Planning Associates, which
operates about 20 women's clinics in California.
   The receptionist, who wouldn't give her name, said about half
the clinic's business is performing abortions.
   It was the third and final day of Operation Rescue's Holy Week
protests. On each of the previous days they also were met by large
counter protests. Police in suburban Cypress made 373 arrests
Thursday, but Long Beach police refused to arrest protesters
Friday, saying the targeted clinic had already closed.
   The latest day of protest began hours after three people were
arrested at Melodyland Christian Center after smoke bombs went off
in the auditorium where anti-abortion advocates have been meeting.
The bombs caused a brief panic but no one was injured, police said.
Those arrested remained in jail in lieu of $25,000 bail each.
   There have been 1.5 million abortions annually in the United
States since the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized
abortion in all states.
   Operation Rescue, based in Binghampton, N.Y., has staged
demonstrations nationwide, notably at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta last summer. Arrests of its members since
1987 total more than 21,000.

   Thousands of people, venting their anger over
privileges of the Communist Party elite, rallied Saturday to
support maverick candidate Boris N. Yeltsin on the eve of national
parliamentary elections.
   ``For shame! For shame!'' more than 10,000 people roared when
speakers listed newspapers and politicians who have attacked
Yeltsin for his unorthodox campaign in the Soviet Union's first
contested election in more than 70 years.
   Hundreds of police stood guard nearby.
   Yeltsin is one of thousands of Soviets campaigning nationwide to
win a seat Sunday in the new 2,250-seat Congress of People's
Deputies. The new chamber was created last year in broad electoral
reforms championed by President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Since his ouster as Moscow's Communist Party boss in 1987,
Yeltsin has emerged as an anti-establishment crusader against
privileges for the powerful, including access to special stores,
better food and chauffeured luxury cars.
   Critics in the party's Central Committee accuse him of accepting
the same privileges.
   Thousands chanted Yeltsin's name at the peaceful rally in a vast
parking lot next to Lenin Stadium, supporting his campaign promise
to work to reduce the privileges if voters elect him.
   ``Do away with special privileges for politicians and
bureaucrats!'' said a placard one demonstrator held aloft on a ski
pole. ``Servants of the people should have to stand in line!'' said
another banner.
   Hundreds of police lined the entrance to the parking lot. Scores
of reinforcements waited in dozens of buses parked nearby. Around a
bend in the road, hidden by trees, 50 military trucks _ packed with
soldiers _ were parked. Rally organizers from three Moscow
political action groups had obtained permission for the three-hour
rally after convincing authorities it would be better than having
an illegal demonstration _ such a March 19 rally in which thousands
of Yeltsin supporters marched through downtown Moscow.
   Yeltsin, 58, is running against 51-year-old Yevgeny Brakov,
director of the ZIL auto factory, for the right to represent all of
Moscow with its 6.5 million registered voters.
   Brakov's campaign has been focused on the issue of ending
chronic Soviet food shortages. ``I am for a speedy decision on the
food problem, development of food and processing industries,'' he
said in an article written for the newspaper Economic Gazette.
   Speakers at the rally also praised the political reforms that
have made Sunday's election possible.
   ``This is the first time in 70 years we have had a real
election,'' speaker Igor Chubais told them.
   He was followed by popular poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who was
loudly applauded after reading a short poem praising Gorbachev's
policy of glasnost, or openness, which allowed the rally to take
place.
   A British newspaper on Sunday quoted Yeltsin as saying in an
interview that restructuring should have begun ``with problems
which everyone would have understood,'' including food
distribution, housing and living standards.
   ``We have wasted 3{ years,'' The Sunday Telegraph quoted him as
saying. ``Now the new direction is concentrating on exactly those
three points. We have admitted that we did not have an overall
conception of perestroika (restructuring).''
   Yelstin said he and Gorbachev have different ideas on how to
push through perestroika, but did not see himself as ``an
alternative to Mr. Gorbachev,'' according to the newspaper.
   Yeltsin said the government needs to cut military spending and
chop investment in industrial construction by about 40 percent.
   He also inveighed against privileges for the elite. ``How can
one tolerate one man eating good quality sausage and another not.
Perestroika should have started in the (Communist) party,'' he said.
   Voting takes place Sunday at 180,000 stations, which will open
from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the country's 11 time zones.
   First results are expected late Sunday night, but full results
will not be known for about 10 days, said the official Soviet news
agency Tass. Election officials say than 190 million of the 280
million Soviets are eligible to vote.
   On Sunday, 1,500 seats are being contested, and the other 750
seats were filled by the Communist Party and other officially
sanctioned groups. About 80 percent of the candidates are party
members.

   The world's first ``space chick'' was
joined by a brood of cousins Saturday, less than a week after their
eggs concluded a five-day flight aboard the space shuttle
Discovery, officials said.
   The first chick, a 41.8-gram male named ``Kentucky,'' emerged
from its shell about 8:30 p.m. EST Friday at Kentucky Fried Chicken
headquarters, the company said in a statement. The fast-food
restaurant chain sponsored the experiment.
   Fifteen more of the space eggs hatched Saturday afternoon, and
16 earthbound eggs that were fertilized later are expected to hatch
in the next few days.
   The experiment, conceived by Purdue University senior John
Vellinger, is designed to measure the effects of a weightless
environment on embryo development.
   The first chick looked normal but only time will tell how well
it does, said Gregg Reynolds, a spokesman for Kentucky Fried
Chicken.
   ``The only thing we're sure about now is that it's a boy,'' he
said.
   Vellinger, 23, was ``as excited as an expectant father,''
Reynolds said.
   ``It sends chills up my spine to realize I've done something no
one has ever done before,'' the young scientist said.
   When Discovery was launched on March 13, it carried an incubator
designed by Vellinger containing 32 chicken eggs. A similar
incubator with a control group of 32 eggs was kept on the ground
during the mission.
   The two groups of eggs and the chicks that emerge from those
eggs will be studied at Purdue by Vellinger and a team of
scientific advisers from four universities during the next year
before a paper assessing the results of the experiment is prepared.
   Vellinger and his five scientific advisers opened the other half
of the 32 Discovery eggs _ and half from the control group left on
earth _ after the shuttle landed to examine the embryos at that
stage in their development.
   The project may help solve some puzzling problems of space
flight, said Ronald Hullinger, a professor of veterinary medicine
at Purdue and one of Vellinger's advisers.
   Information the scientists glean from differences in cartilage,
bone, tissue and internal organs between the space chicks and their
Earthbound contemporaries may shed light on motion sickness in zero
gravity and the puzzling loss of bone mass in astronauts. It could
also provide clues about humans reproducing during generations-long
voyages.

<TEXT>
   Democratic mayoral candidate Richard M. Daley is
maintaining a comfortable lead over his two opponents as the April
4 election draws near, according to two new polls.
   A poll in Sunday editions of the Chicago Sun-Times showed Daley
with a 21 point lead over independent candidate Timothy Evans,
while a poll in Sunday's Chicago Tribune showed him leading Evans
by 14 points.
   According to the Sun-Times poll, 51 percent of the electorage
favor Daley, compared to 30 percent for Evans and 6 percent for
Republican Edward Vrdolyak. Thirteen percent were undecided.
   The Tribune showed Daley on top with 48 percent and Evans second
with 34 percent. Four percent of the respondents preferred Vrdolyak
and 14 percent were undecided.
   Evans dismissed the polls as inaccurate and said he wasn't
worried.
   ``The only poll that matters is the one that's going to be taken
on the fourth of April,'' Evans told supporters at the headquarters
of Operation Push, the civil rights group. ``And that's the one
we're going to win.''
   Evans, Vrdolyak and Daley are vying for a chance to complete the
final two years of the second term of Harold Washington, Chicago's
first black mayor, who died of a heart attack in November 1987.
   Both polls showed Evans, the only black candidate in the
contest, with a heavy lead among blacks, but with minimal support
among whites. The polls also showed Daley, the son of the late
Mayor Richard J. Daley, with overwhelming support among Hispanics.
   The Sun-Times poll has a margin of error of 4 percentage points,
while the Tribune poll's margin of error is 3 points.

   A car driven by an elderly man smashed
through a glass window in a crowded supermarket Saturday afternoon,
injuring at least 10 people before it came to a halt at a cash
register counter, authorities said.
   One cashier at the Pathmark supermarket suffered serious back
and internal injuries when she was hit by the car and flying glass
and brick, said West Orange Police Chief Edward M. Palardy.
   ``The operator of the vehicle blacked out at the driver's
wheel,'' Palardy said. ``He proceeded down the parking aisle,
accelerating and nearly striking several people who had to dodge
and dart out of the way. It was mass chaos.''
   Robert Wunderle, spokesman for Pathmark's parent company,
Supermarkets General, said two other cashiers and five customers
also were injured. However, Palardy said the other seven people
injured were all customers. The discrepancy could not immediately
be resolved.
   He said West Orange police would examine the car for mechanical
problems.
   The driver, 80-year-old Wolodymyr Szpyrka of West Orange, his
70-year-old wife Ewhenia, the seriously injured employee and the
seven others were taken to several area hospitals, Palardy said.
   The driver was listed in stable condition at Mountainside
Hospital in Montclair, Palardy said. The nature of his injuries
were not immediately known.
   Mrs. Szpyrka was in shock and not able to say if her husband
blacked out regularly, the police chief said.
   ``Because of his age and the seriousness of the accident, we'll
examine whether he should be allowed to keep his license,'' Palardy
said, adding that the driver was not cited.
   Several hundred people were inside the store in a small shopping
mall in this northern New Jersey community northwest of Newark,
said Robert Wunderle, spokesman for Pathmark's parent company,
Supermarkets General.
   The four-door Buick was about 50 feet from the store when it hit
a dip, flew into the air and crashed through the window, said John
George of East Orange, a witness. The front half of the car was
lodged inside the building for about 1{ hours before being removed
by a tow truck about 5:30 p.m.
   Bobi Bennett of West Orange was standing at a checkout counter
when the car stopped near the register where she waited in line.
   ``He (the driver) was just sitting there staring. I thought he'd
had a heart attack or something and he was gunning the engine for
quite a while,'' Ms. Bennett said. ``Somebody had to scream at him
to turn the car off.''
   Ms. Bennett said she used a bar that separates grocery orders to
help pry out a woman trapped between a register and the car. The
woman was screaming, but most customers remained calm, she said.
   Isakson said no one was trapped under the car, and no mechanical
equipment was needed to remove the injured people.

   A derailed train carrying a gasoline additive
erupted into flames in a freight yard Saturday, sending dark,
billowing smoke over a northeast Houston subdivision.
   A tanker loaded with heptane derailed as the train was being
linked at about 5 p.m. and took five other cars off the tracks. The
heptane may have been ignited by the grinding wheels, officials
said.
   No one was hurt in the blaze, said District Chief W.M. Whatley
of the Houston Fire Department.
   ``We're just letting it burn off,'' said Whatley, who predicted
the blaze would burn out by early Sunday.
   Smoke from the fire blanketed a nearby subdivision and an
environmental service company, EmTech, was called in to monitor the
blaze.
   Three cars caught fire, including a tanker carrying light
lubrication oil and a boxcar carrying plastics, which erupted in
orange flames, officials said.

<HEAD>City's Plan To Cut Benefits For Retired Police Dogs Draws Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials thought they would save
$13,500 annually by pulling retired German Shepherds out of the
public trough, but the action brought a snarling response from the
dogs' human supporters.
   The trouble began when the Police Department decided to cut off
retirement benefits for over-the-hill police dogs, who had been
receiving pensions of food, biscuits and veterinary care.
   First, the Fraternal Order of Police announced plans for a
lawsuit. Then a group of activists gathered more than 1,000
signatures on petitions urging Police Commissioner Willie L.
Williams to reverse the decision.
   The leader of the petition campaign, Randi L. Biba, also wrote
to various dog food manufacturers pleading for help.
   Finally, Alpo Petfood Inc., based in Allentown, came through
this week with an offer to provide free canned or dry food for the
36 retirees until the issue is resolved. Alpo volunteered to give
food to police for distribution.
   But police officials said they're not quite ready to shake on
the deal.
   ``I don't know what our decision will be,'' said police
spokesman Capt. Richard DeLise. ``We're going to have to look at
this closely to see what it's going to entail. We have to figure
out logistics.''
   DeLise said Deputy Police Commissioner Thomas McGeehan would
meet with Alpo officials to talk about the company's proposal.
   ``We're getting out of the retired dog food business,'' DeLise
said.

<DATELINE>LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   False aircraft images on radar screens
startled air traffic controllers at an Federal Aviation
Administration center, but one official said the problem may have
been a computer that ``just went haywire.''
   Controllers at the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center ``at
several sectors were astonished to see numerous `UFOs' appearing on
their radar displays,'' Kevin Cain, a center spokesman, said of the
incident on Tuesday.
   Cain, the center's National Air Traffic Controllers Association
safety chairman, released written comments on the incident Friday.
   FAA officials would not comment directly on the incident.
   ``These unidentified targets looked like actual aircraft, with
apparently normal speeds and altitudes,'' Cain's statement said.
``Some controllers had a dozen or more of these targets merging
with actual aircraft targets over a half-hour period.''
   Mitch Barker, an FAA spokesman at the regional office in
Seattle, would not directly answer when questioned about the false
targets.
   Cain said he believed the problem was caused by a relatively new
computer system, in operation at the center in September 1987.
   ``The head of the safety committee for the controller's union
believes that the new computer just went haywire for that period of
time,'' Cain said. ``We have not seen anything like this out there
before.''
   Barker said the problems were caused by the data feed from the
Grand Junction radar site.
   ``They were having a problem with the transponders (which
automatically send information from the aircraft to the center),''
said Barker. The FAA would only confirm that the controllers were
not receiving correct data blocks of identifying information that
appear on controller screens.
   ``They had, a day before, a commercial power outage in Grand
Junction. This problem appeared after that outage,'' Barker said.
``A relay had gone bad. They believe that outage had something to
do with it.''
   Barker said the radar feed was only out for 51 minutes and
adjoining radar sites were able to provide sufficient radar data to
the sectors involved.
   Other controllers at the site said it is not unusual to get
false targets on occasion, but such a large number of false targets
might be dangerous. During busy traffic times, one sector might
have about 15 real targets on the screen, although Cain said the
false targets appeared at a slow time of day.
   The center controls aircraft between airports in about 35
sectors, an area including Colorado and Wyoming and parts of Utah,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota.
   Cain said there have been a number of computer and radio
problems at the center during the last year.

<TEXT>
   A grisly find on a country golf course has
police culling clues from around the nation, but so far detectives
are baffled about the identity of a woman whose head was discovered
lying along a brook.
   Police say they may have to use the lastest technology of modern
forensics to determine the victim's identity.
   ``We have nothing concrete,'' said Hopewell Township Police Lt.
Michael Chipowski. ``We've gotten dozens of calls about people who
haven't been seen for a while, but they haven't led anywhere.''
   Chipowski said the case has recently drawn more than 200 leads
and inquiries from across the nation.
   ``Probably nothing has stirred up such excitement here since the
Lindbergh case,'' Chipowski said, referring to the trial of Bruno
Hauptmann, who was convicted in a nearby courthouse of murdering
flying ace Charles Lindbergh's baby son a half century ago.
   ``This is certainly out of the ordinary. It's a real mystery,''
he said.
   The female human head was discovered March 5 by a golfer whose
errant shot sent him searching for his ball along the bank of a
brook at the Hopewell Valley Golf Club north of Trenton. Chipowski
said police believe the killing occurred just before the discovery
because there was fresh makeup on the head and ``the features were
in a good state.''
   ``We have about 30 leads yet to complete,'' said Chipowski.
``We'll run down every one of them.''

   The U.S. Customs Service has deployed

drug-related corruption and other internal problems, an agency
spokesman said Saturday night.
   The spokesman, Richard Weart, said these personnel had been
specially selected ``to be alert for serious types of corruption.''
   ``They are assigned to a district office or regional office or
to the office of enforcement. But they are not directly assigned to
internal affairs,'' Weart said.
   He said they are not paid extra for their role in monitoring
other employees.
   ``But if the situation arises they will report to a local office
of internal affairs on such matters,'' Weart said.
   The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that Assistant
Customs Commissioner for Internal Affairs William F. Green had
recruited about 40 agency employees as field associates assigned to
key offices nationwide to ``keep their eyes and ears open for any
wrongdoing'' among their colleagues.
   The Post said the group was selected from among recruits
training at the Federal Law Enforcement Academy at Glynco, Ga.
   Weart acknowledged that the group had received additional
training for uncovering serious types of corruption, such as theft
of cash or other evidence seized by the service. But he said they
were ``certainly not trained as spies.''
   ``In our view, for an agency that is on the front line of drug
interdiction we intend to hold our employees to a higher
standard,'' he said.
   Weart said the approach of having employees act as informers
against their co-workers was ``nothing new,'' explaining that the
code of conduct for federal employees required reporting wrongdoing
by fellow workers.
   He added that the program was modeled after a New York City
police department internal investigation headed by ex-officer Frank
Serpico.
   Recently two Customs inspectors were arrested in Hidalgo, Texas,
on bribery charges and five agency workers were arrested in New
York with airport and Agriculture Departmewnt workers on
drug-dealing charges.

   Millions of gallons of crude oil that
spilled when a tanker ran aground spread across a wildlife-rich
stretch of ocean Saturday, and Alaska's chief environmental officer
criticized cleanup efforts as too slow.
   The biggest oil spill in U.S. history created a slick about
seven miles long and seven miles wide in Prince William Sound. The
Coast Guard said only Reef Island and the western edge of Bligh
Island had been touched by the slick.
   ``This situation, I think, was everyone's secret nightmare about
what could happen with oil traffic in the sound,'' said Dennis
Kelso, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   Some 240,000 barrels _ about 10,080,000 gallons _ of crude oil
from Alaska's North Slope spilled early Friday when the 987-foot
tanker Exxon Valdez ran hard aground on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles
outside Valdez, where it had taken on a total cargo of 1.2 million
barrels. Initial reports indicated 270,000 barrels had spilled.
   ``What we have here is a major environmental catastrophe,'' said
one oil spill expert, Richard Golob of Boston, publisher of Golob
Oil Pollution Bulletin.
   Golob said cleanup equipment at the site was ``grossly
inadequate'' but added that even under ideal circumstances cleanup
efforts would not have significantly reduced the spill's impact.
   ``It is an enclosed body of water,'' he said. ``The only way for
this oil to ecape out to the sea is by traversing the entire length
of Prince William Sound with all its islands, fjords and bays and
channels.
   ``And during that transit, undoubtedly a large stretch of
shoreline will be contaminated,'' he said.
   Divers Saturday said they had found six to eight holes in the
vessel's hull large enough to swim through, said Frank Iarossi,
president of Exxon Shipping Co. About 30 feet of the vessel is
resting on a shelf on the reef.
   Efforts to begin pumping 200,000 gallons of oil off the Exxon
Valdez onto another tanker, the Exxon Baton Rouge, were halted
early Saturday when authorities noticed that oil appeared to
leaking as the pumping operation proceeded.
   Eleven of 17 tanks that lie forward of the ship's masthead were
ruptured in the accident, causing concern over removal of the oil,
said Coast Guard Lt. Ed Wieliczkiewicz.
   ``Whenever you start removing oil from a vessel this size it has
to be done in a controlled manner,'' Wieliczkiewicz said. ``If it's
not ... you endanger the stability of the vessel.''
   Wieliczkiewicz said a boom was placed around the Exxon Valdez
and the Exxon Baton Rouge to help contain oil around the vessels.
   He also said four members of the Coast Guard's Pacific Strike
Team from San Francisco, specially trained to deal with pollution
and oil spills, arrived Saturday and were helping to rig pumps and
assemble equipment needed to transfer oil to the Baton Rouge.
   Kelso was highly critical of what he said was a slow response to
the spill.
   ``The initial reponse was inadequate and unacceptable,'' he said
before a news conference Saturday. Kelso said the efforts should
have been under way in five hours, but took much longer. ``You miss
the opportunity right at the beginning and you've missed our best
opportunity to do something.''
   Kelso said Alaska has a plan for oil spills that calls for
action within five hours of a spill. It took several hours longer,
he said, and only two of seven skimmers available to the Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co. were used at the outset.
   Alyeska spokesman Chuck O'Donnel said he was satisfied with his
company's actions. ``I think our people did an excellent job,'' he
said.
   The spill's effect on wildlife had not yet been assessed, but
commercial fishermen who depend on the sound for a catch worth
millions of dollars were outraged and said a key herring spawning
area had been polluted.
   ``The whole food chain could be affected by the spill,'' said
Alan Reichman, ocean ecology coordinator for the environmental
group Greenpeace, in Seattle.
   ``There's a high concentration of sea otter, waterfowl, sea
birds and pink salmon in that area,'' said Steve Goldstein, a
spokesman for the Interior Department in Washington. ``Some birds
have already died, and we are doing our best to try to save the
fish by containing the oil to the area where it presently is and by
trying to skim it.''
   Whales, porpoises and seals are also common in Prince William
Sound. ``It's kind of like sailing through a zoo,'' said Jim
Lethcoe, who lives on a boat in the sound and operates a sailing
business.
   An animal cleanup station was set up in a building at the
community college in Valdez, but volunteers there said they had no
animals to work on by midafternoon.
   The response to the spill also drew fire from the 12,000-member
United Fishermen of Alaska.
   ``We feel that this should have been the easiest oil spill in
the world to clean up,'' said Riki Ott, chairman of the
organization's habitat committee. She noted that the spill had
occurred in a protected area close to the Valdez marine terminal
and the water was calm.
   Ott said the spill had polluted Prince William Sound's primary
herring spawning area. Fishermen also take salmon and shellfish
from the sound. Last year, they were paid about $85 million for
their catches, she said.
   The Port of Valdez remained closed to tanker traffic. North
Slope crude oil is shipped 800 miles through the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline from Prudhoe Bay south to Valdez for shipment aboard
tankers to refineries outside Alaska.
   The Coast Guard said the Exxon Valdez struck the reef when it
maneuvered outside normal tanker traffic lanes to avoid icebergs.
   The vessel's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, has worked for Exxon for
20 years, at least 10 as a ship's master. It was unclear if a pilot
was aboard the Exxon Valdez when it grounded.
   There was no decision Saturday on whether to use chemicals to
disperse the oil, but a test of the dispersal method was being
conducted Saturday afternoon, as was a test to determine whether at
least some of the crude oil could be burned.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Steven McCall said National Transportation
Safety Board investigators are expected to arrive Sunday to take
over the accident probe.
   He said one or more blood-alcohol tests were administered after
the grounding, but he said he didn't know know how many people were
tested or the results. McCall said the tests routinely are
administered in marine accidents involving federal jurisdiction.
   The Coast Guard issued a statement late Saturday that McCall has
subpoenaed the ship's master and two crew members.
   The subpoenas require them to make themselves available to NTSB
investigators arriving Sunday. The Coast Guard said the supoenas
were routine.
   Previously, the largest U.S. tanker spill was the Dec. 15, 1976,
grounding of the Argo Merchant tanker off the Nantucket shoals off
Massachusetts, in which 7.6 million gallons of oil spilled, Golob
said.
   Up to 10.7 million gallons of oil was lost on Nov. 1, 1979, when
the tanker Burmah Agate collided with another ship in Galveston
Bay, Texas. However, that oil burned as well as spilled.
   The largest tanker spill in history resulted from the July 19,
1979, collision off Tobago of the supertankers Atlantic Empress and
Aegean Captain, in which 300,000 tons _ more than 80 million
gallons _ of oil was lost.

   House and Senate leaders predict smooth
sailing for a new policy toward Central America containing $45
million for Nicaraguan guerrillas even though some conservatives in
Congress say they will try to change it.
   Nicaragua's leftist government said it didn't like the U.S.
program either.
   In Managua, Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Alejandro Bendana
called the plan ``confusing and unclear'' and said it goes against
a regional pact that calls for dismantling the rebel force by
mid-May.
   ``Humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a
contradiction in terms,'' Bendana said.

   The government will try to block Oliver
North's effort to get former President Reagan to testify as leadoff
witness for the defense at the Iran-Contra trial next week.
   The government has a court motion pending to quash the subpoena
for Reagan and ``we will pursue that matter,'' David Runkel, an
aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said Friday.
   The defense sought a court order seeking the former president's
appearance next Friday following testimony in the past month at
North's trial that Reagan was deeply involved in helping the
Contras.
   The judge in the North case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, is expected to schedule a hearing for next week to consider
the defense request.

   After seven decades of Communist rule, Soviets
borrow a page from Western democracies this weekend with their
nation's first contested elections.
   However, they won't be forsaking Communist controls in place
since 1917. The party will remain the cornerstone of political
life, despite the new democratic trappings.
   Soviets are voting Sunday to fill 1,500 seats in a 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies, a new chamber created last year in
broad electoral reforms championed by Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The rest of the seats have been directly filled by the Communist
Party and other officially sanctioned groups ranging from labor
unions to an association of stamp collectors.

   The U.S. official in charge of foreign
disaster relief is calling on nations around the world to ``put the
cash down'' and help avert a repetition of the massive starvation
that afflicted Sudan last year.
   Julia Taft, director of the State Department's Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance, said Friday that unless a U.N.-sponsored
emergency relief program succeeds, hundreds of thousands could be
lost.
   The United Nations estimated that more than 250,000 Sudanese
died of starvation last year because food deliveries were impeded
by the civil war between the Sudanese government and the Sudanese
Liberation People's Liberation Army.
   Ms. Taft discussed the U.S. role in Operation Lifeline, the
U.N.-sponsored effort designed to deliver more than 100,000 tons of
food to more than 1 million people next month. Project participants
say it is the largest effort of its kind in a developing nation.

   Pro-choice activists called the leader of an anti-abortion group
``Ayatollah Terry'' as he and his supporters led demonstrations
around the country in a Holy Week campaign that resulted in several
hundred arrests.
   Nearly 300 people were arrested Friday in Philadelphia and
Albany, N.Y. In Long Beach, Calif., police refused to arrest any of
the 350 Operation Rescue protesters at a sit-in outside a medical
building although they defied an order to disperse. Police made no
arrests because the building was closed, said Police Chief Lawrence
Binkley.
   In Philadelphia, 180 people were arrested following
demonstrations at two clinics. The protests came three days after a
federal judge barred all such disruptive demonstrations by abortion
opponents at clinics.
   The demonstrators gathered in rain and gusting winds outside
Planned Parenthood and the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center for
Women, chanting and singing. Only protesters at Planned Parenthood
were arrested.

   A satellite circled Earth on a
missile-hunting assignment today as part of research into a
spaced-based defense system after passing its first tracking test
within hours of soaring into orbit.
   The 3-ton Delta Star payload rocketed into space Friday to begin
a monthslong mission during which it is to aim its sensors at
several ground-based missile and space launches.
   The research could help perfect the technology for detecting and
destroying enemy missiles within minutes after they leave their
launch pads.
   The satellite passed its first trial within two hours after
liftoff when it successfully tracked the thrusting second stage of
its own Delta booster rocket after separation and during its fiery
destruction in the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
