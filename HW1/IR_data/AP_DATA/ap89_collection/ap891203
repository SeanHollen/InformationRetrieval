<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors are investigating a
controversial transaction through which Mayor-elect David Dinkins
said he transferred stock to his son, the Daily News reported
Sunday.
   The probe by U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney's office is part of a
larger inquiry into a cable television franchise related to Inner
City Broadcasting Corp., the News quoted unidentified law
enforcement sources as saying.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether Dinkins
transferred Inner City stock to his son, David Dinkins Jr., through
a genuine transaction in 1985; how much it was worth and whether
taxes were fully paid, the News said.
   Dinkins' spokesman, David Fishlow, said the mayor-elect had
hired a criminal attorney, Charles Stillman.
   ``I'm confident this inquiry will reveal that there's nothing
with which I need to be concerned,'' Dinkins told reporters Sunday.
``Those of us in public life are subject to criticism and scrutiny
of all sorts over time.''
   Dinkins said the federal investigation is a response to a
suggestion by his opponent, Republican Rudolph Giuliani, that the
stock deal be looked into.
   ``My marching order from Mr. Dinkins is 1,000 percent
cooperation,'' Stillman told the News. ``We want to put this thing
to bed once and for all.''
   Stillman, however, also described the investigation as ``Rudy
Giuliani's last hurrah.''
   Dinkins, a Democrat, defeated Giuliani last month following a
campaign highlighted by questions about Dinkins' finances. Giuliani
is a former U.S. attorney for Manhattan. Maloney is U.S. attorney
for Brooklyn.
   Inner City owns a number of radio stations and one of its
subsidiaries has a substantial interest in the Queens Innerunity
Cable Systems franchise. Its chairman, former Manhattan Borough
President President Percy Sutton, is a longtime friend of Dinkins.
   Dinkins first acquired stock in the privately held company in
1972. His holdings grew to 588 shares, largely, he has said,
through stock splits.
   Dinkins said he transferred the stock to his son after his
election as Manhattan borough president in 1985 to avoid a conflict
between his position on the Board of Estimate and the board's role
in regulating cable television.
   It was assumed at the time that he gave the shares to his son as
a gift.
   During the mayoral campaign, it was revealed that Dinkins had
not paid a gift tax. Dinkins released a handwritten note dated Oct.
30, 1985, in which his son agreed to buy the stock, promising to
pay $58,000 in 1991 plus 8 percent interest a year.
   Dinkins, his son and Sutton then declined to release financial
or corporate records that might further document the transaction as
described.
   The News said the investigation includes testing the paper and
the ink in the note to determine whether it was written in 1985 or
during the campaign. There also are plans to analyze the
handwriting.
   Dinkins once placed the stock's worth at $1 million on a
financial disclosure form. But during the campaign he said he had
done so in error, based on an inflated appraisal by Sutton.
   The city Department of Investigation is conducting a separate,
previously disclosed investigation into whether Dinkins filed
misleading financial disclosure forms regarding the stock.

   Four members of a U.S.
congressional delegation criticized Nicaragua Saturday after they
were denied entry by that country's leftist government to observe
its elections.
   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said Nicaragua ``stuck its foot in its mouth.''
   Also denied entry were Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga.; Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and Chuck Douglas, R-N.H.
   The four are part of a 20-member delegation named by President
Bush to inspect preparations for the Feb. 25 elections. Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega blocked their entry, saying they were not
impartial observers because they had been appointed by Bush.
   The group came to Tegucigalpa after they were denied Nicaraguan
visas.
   Nicaragua's elections are part of a Central American peace plan
that also calls for the disbanding of U.S.-supported Nicaraguan
rebels known as Contras.
   The congressmen planned to spend two days in Honduras visiting
U.S. forces based at Palmerola, 40 miles from Tegucigalpa, and
Contra camps in Honduras near the border with Nicaragua.

   A charter fishing boat with 19 people aboard
sank near the entrance to New York Harbor Saturday, killing two men
and injuring at least 16 other people, authorities said.
   All 19 people aboard were pulled from the frigid waters within
two hours of the sinking, which was reported at about 3:30 p.m.,
Coast Guard officials said.
   Captain Jack Chale said the 110-foot Bronx Queen was in 40 feet
of water ``when we hit something, hit a submerged object. Whatever
it was, I have no idea. I never saw it.
   ``Soon as I seen I had trouble, I called the Coast Guard
immediately,'' Chale said. The boat began taking on water right
away.
   One of those rescued, an unidentified man in his 50s, died hours
later at Peninsula General Hospital in the New York City borough of
Queens, said Sgt. Mary Wrensen, a city police spokesowoman. The
man's body temperature had dropped to 81 degrees and he suffered
cardiac arrest, hospital spokeswoman Karen Perlman said.
   Another man, also unidentified and also said to be in his 50s,
died at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J., said Carol
Scheideler, a nursing supervisor there.
   Fifteen other people were taken to two New Jersey hospitals, and
a 16th was at Peninsula General in New York.
   Chale declined hospital treatment, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Gary Henderson. He was taken to the Coast Guard station at
Sandy Hook, N.J., for questioning, Henderson said.
   The Bronx Queen went down near Ambrose Light, between New Jersey
and Long Island and about 15 miles southeast of the Verrazano
Narrows Bridge spanning the entrance to the harbor, said Lt. Paul
Wolf of the Coast Guard operations center in Boston.
   ``The seas were very rough when we got on the scene,'' said
Petty Officer Frank Pechacek of the Coast Guard's Sandy Hook, N.J.,
station.
   ``As we approached, we could see about 30 feet of the boat still
above water and all the people were on the bow,'' Pechacek said.
   Petty Officer John Belloni said people starting jumping off the
bow as the rescue vessels approached.
   Coast Guard boats from Queens and Sandy Hook and helicopters
from Brooklyn and Cape May, N.J., participated in the rescue, Wolf
said.
   ``They basically launched everything they could,'' he said.
   The water temperature in the harbor was 48 degrees, the National
Weather Service said.

   After four days of hiding out in Europe, Olympic
gold medalist Nadia Comaneci spent her first full day of freedom in
the United States on Saturday doing the same thing.
   The 28-year-old Romanian gymnast, who burst into prominence with
her run of perfect 10s in the 1976 Olympics, slipped out of sight
Friday following a brief news conference shortly after her arrival
at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
   ``I wanted to have a free life,'' said Comaneci, who was
guaranteed political asylum here, and on Saturday that included
staying out of the limelight generated by her defection.
   Comaneci reportedly spent Friday night in New York, but there
were varying reports about her whereabouts Saturday.
   United States Gymnastics Federation spokeswoman Patti Auer said
the State Department told a federation official that Comaneci was
headed to Miami on Saturday afternoon on a Pan Am flight.
   But the captain of the flight Comaneci was scheduled to take
said she had canceled her plans.
   ``Nadia was to be with us on our flight but ... she decided to
stay in New York,'' said pilot Conrad Gosheff. ``At the last
minute, they said she's not coming.''
   Pan Am spokeswoman Suzanne Timper said the airline _ which
carried Comaneci into the United States from Vienna _ had no
reservations out of JFK under the gymnast's name. Reporters at JFK
when the Miami-bound flight was due to board did not see her and
Port Authority police, who patrol the sprawling airport, said they
weren't aware of her plans.
   Auer said Comaneci ``has not contacted us, and we'd like to know
what her plans are.''
   State Department press officer Sondra McCarty said her agency
was not providing any information on Comaneci.
   In addition to the report that Comaneci was heading to Miami,
there were reports after her arrival here that she might go to
Indianapolis, Houston or Orlando, Fla.
   Indianapolis is where the U.S. Gymnastics Federation is based,
while Comaneci's former Romanian coach, Bela Karoly, now is a U.S.
citizen and runs an elite gymnastics training camp north of Houston.
   Another Romanian exile, John Boularca of Davie, Fla., said that
Comaneci was coming to Florida to stay with Konstantin Panit and
his family. Panit accompanied Comaneci at her news conference
Friday; he lives with his wife and three children in a community of
Romanians in south Florida.
   Comaneci was 14 years old when she gained worldwide fame by
becoming the first gymnast ever to score a perfect 10 at the
Olympics _ an achievement she repeated seven times at the 1976
games.
   She won 21 gold medals altogether in Olympic and other
international meets during her career, earning a life of privilege
in her hard-line Communist homeland.
   Comaneci _ accompanied by six fellow Romanians _ crossed the
border into Hungary on Tuesday and went into hiding. She told a
border guard she was leaving Romania ``for the sake of freedom.''
Romania, unlike other Eastern European countries, has resisted the
recent trend toward political and personal liberty for its
residents.
   Comaneci would be eligible to apply for permanent resident
status in the United States in one year, U.S. officials said.
   Karolyi, who was in West Germany last week, said Friday that he
planned to return to the United States this weekend and hoped to
meet up with Comaneci, perhaps in Indianapolis.
   Mike Jacki, the gymnastics federation's executive director, said
late Saturday that he understood Comaneci would initially stay in a
Romanian immigrant neighborhood in Miami.
   ``I'm anticipating that she'll be there as long as she needs to
be there,'' Jacki told The Associated Press in Indianapolis.
   Jacki said Comaneci has been granted refugee status and now
needs to select a U.S. citizen as a sponsor.
   ``Regardless of where she ends up, at least in the immediate
future, we are hopeful to have dialogue with her and give her some
advice and guidance,'' he said.
   ``I'd hate to have her make a decision that would be without
that guidance. This is America, and we want her to like it here and
a have a positive and honest experience in everything she does.''
   He said among her options would be working for the U.S.
federation, ``or public relations, or be a candidate for the
international federation. As a coach, she could touch many
athletes.''
   Jacki's wife, Terry, told The Indianapolis Star that Comaneci is
welcome to stay with her and her husband, adding, ``I think she
kind of wants to stay here awhile.''

<HEAD>Report: Pierce Awarded HUD Grant To Friend Despite Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former federal housing secretary Samuel Pierce
awarded a $350,000 grant to a longtime friend although other
housing officials had rejected the project, The New York Times
reported.
   The 1985 grant was awarded to Samuel P. Singletary, a Republican
who helped direct Pierce's unsuccessful campaigns for election as a
Manhattan judge in 1959 and 1960, the Times reported in its Sunday
editions.
   DuBois L. Gilliam, a former Pierce aide, told the Times that
Pierce ordered him to give the grant to Singletary even though
others at the Department of Housing and Urban Development opposed
it on the ground that Singletary's firm had too little experience.
   ``I think it was a case where there was a longterm friendship
between Pierce and Singletary,'' said Gilliam, who is serving an
18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy
charges involving other HUD grants.
   Gilliam said Singletary repeatedly called Pierce about
Singletary's Washington-based consulting firm, the Center for
Resource Development.
   Pierce ``told me he wanted us to help Singletary get some money
_ he said Singletary is a good guy,'' Gilliam told the Times.
   Pierce said through a lawyer, Robert E. Plotkin, that he did not
remember the grant to Singletary. Even if he had ordered it, there
would not have been anything improper about it, the lawyer said.
   ``This was a discretionary fund. This was his absolute right and
authority,'' Plotkin told the Times.
   Singletary told the Times that he met with Pierce several times
but said he never discussed the grant.
   ``Are you asking me if Sam Pierce did me a favor? Absolutely
not,'' Singletary said.
   The Times said HUD records indicate that Singletary's group was
supposed to use the grant to assist the cities of Camden and East
Orange in programs to attract private development money to New
Jersey.
   In recent months, Pierce, citing his Fifth Amendment right
against self incrimination, has refused to cooperate with
congressional inquiries into political favoritism and fraud at HUD
during the Reagan Administration.

<HEAD>Reports: Philippines Asked For US Air Attacks on Rebel Targets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Philippine government asked for U.S.
warplanes to attack rebel targets to help put down the latest
military coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino's
government, two newspapers reported in their Sunday editions.
   The ``urgent'' requests, which the Bush administration refused
late Thursday, were made by Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos through
military and intelligence channels, The Washington Post reported,
citing a variety of unnamed administration sources.
   The Los Angeles Times, also citing an anonymous source, reported
that the Philippine government asked that American planes bomb
rebel-held air bases, fuel dumps and a seaborne freighter.
   The U.S. Embassy in Manilla received telephone calls from Mrs.
Aquino, Ramos and another senior defense official, the Times said.
   The requests were numerous and confused, making it difficult for
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to
sort them out, according to the Post.
   The request for U.S. planes to bomb some positions was turned
down because Americans may have been on bases commandeered by the
rebels and out of concern for the political impact of direct U.S.
intervention, the Post said.
   U.S. F-4 fighter-bombers flew cover for government troops on
Friday and early Saturday morning but were idle on Sunday and never
fired a shot at ground targets, U.S. officials said.
   According to earlier administration accounts, the jets were not
deployed until Mrs. Aquino made a formal request through U.S.
Ambassador Nicholas Platt.
   The Times said Aquino ``wanted the fuel dumps and an armoured
column'' to come under U.S. attack. Ramos called for attacks on the
air bases to disable rebel-controlled aircraft on the ground. The
Philippine military official, who was not identified, wanted the
U.S. to attack the freighter believed to be carrying munitions or
reinforcements for the rebels.

   A leader of the Philippine coup attempt said
U.S. military intervention was all that had kept President Corazon
Aquino's government from toppling and vowed to continue the
insurrection, in an interview published Sunday.
   ``It ain't over until it's over,'' Brig. Gen. Edgardo M. Abenina
told the the Los Angeles Times. ``We shall fight, and we shall
continue fighting for what we believe in, for the honor of our
nation and the dignity of our people _ even if it means going into
a stage of civil war.''
   Rebel soldiers battled loyalist troops in Manila's financial
district and at armed forces headquarters Sunday, the third day of
an attempt to overthrow Aquino.
   Abenina, a former officer of the Philippine constabulary, said
the insurgents are mostly present or former members of the
Philippine armed forces and none are politicians. He described them
as reform-minded nationalists.
   Abenina said rebels were fighting Aquino to ``free the Filipinos
from the shackles of poverty and subservience that have been forced
upon us by the rich and powerful, by elitist governments like that
of Cory Aquino.''
   He added, ``Our whole point is that, for centuries, the
Philippines have been under the mercy and control of a very few
politicians and moneyed people.'' The coup, according to Abenina,
has been planned for more than a year.
   Abenina, who Aquino has identified as a rebel ring-leader, said,
``Our goal is to purge the armed forces and the political
leadership of the government of the rampant corruption and
patronage that has set in from the highest to the lowest levels.''
   Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan is part of the coup's
leadership, Abenina said. Honasan led an August 1987 coup attempt
that left 53 dead. He was imprisoned but escaped in April 1988.
Abenina also took part in the coup attempt and was jailed and later
escaped.
   Abenina said if the coup succeeds he will establish a
military-civilian governing council with himself in charge. The
council would have five to seven members, exercise unchallenged
executive power and include dozens of Filipino experts, technocrats
and professors, Abenina said.
   He said the coup attempt, which began Friday, would have been
successful if the U.S. mililtary had not intervened.
   When President Bush announced that he was extending air support
to the Philippines military, ``we were about to take over the
government,'' Abenina said. ``Then the U.S. warplanes appeared. We
simply cannot hope to win against the stronger power of the United
States Air Force.''
   According to American officials, U.S. F-4 fighter-bombers flew
cover for loyalist troops on Friday and early Saturday morning but
never fired a shot at ground targets.

   President Bush said Sunday that he
is prepared to take additional military action to defend the
Philippine government against mutinous troops if American lives are
threatened or President Corazon Aquino requests it.
   In a letter to U.S. congressional leaders under the War Powers
Act, Bush formally notified Congress that, at Mrs. Aquino's
request, he had ordered military support for the Philippine
government to prevent rebel aircraft from taking off from two air
bases briefly held by the rebels.
   The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday
that the Philippine government had requested that U.S. warplanes
attack rebel targets. The Post said the request was turned down
because Americans may have been on bases commandeered by the rebels
and out of concern for the political impact of direct U.S.
intervention.
   At least 51 people have been killed and nearly 300 wounded since
the insurgents launched their attempt Friday to overthrow the
Aquino government. Rebel soldiers continued to battle loyalist
troops in the capital's financial district and at armed forces
headquarters Sunday.
   In his letter to Congress, Bush wrote, ``At present, I do not
foresee the need for U.S. military action in addition to the
measures described above. I am prepared, however, to take
additional actions to protect the lives of Americans, should they
be threatened, and, if requested, to provide further assistance to
the government of the Philippines.''
   Bush said there were no American casualties during the U.S.
action Friday. ``No rebel aircraft attempted to take off,'' he
said, ``and U.S. aircraft did not fire.''
   Bush said he also had ordered a company of Marines to reinforce
the U.S. Embassy Marine guard in Manila.
   Bush said he had acted ``in accordance with recognized
principles of international law'' in backing the constitutional
government of the Philippines and within his authority as president
and commander-in-chief of U.S. armed forces.

   Government forces on Sunday repulsed
an attack on military headquarters by rebel soliders seeking to
topple President Corazon Aquino, and hundreds of insurgents
surrendered.
   However, fighting continued between loyal troops and other
rebels in the country's financial center.
   Military officials said the failure of the rebels to capture the
Camp Aguinaldo military headquarters dealt a fatal blow to the
3-day-old coup attempt.
   ``I will fulfill what I said _ no cease-fire. What they started,
we will finish,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a national radio address.
   At least 51 people have been killed and nearly 300 wounded since
the insurgents launched their revolt Friday.
   Rebels bombarded the military headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo
early Sunday with 105mm howitzers, and government jet fighters and
helicopter gunships attacked the mutineers' positions.
   The military said the rebels also launched a ground attack on
Camp Aquinaldo, five miles east of Mrs. Aquino's office, but it was
repulsed after a four-hour battle. The commander of the rebel
assault, Lt. Col. Cesar dela Pena, later surrendered with more than
200 men.
   Later Sunday, Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando, commander of Fort
Magsaysay, surrendered in the city's Greenhills District with about
400 army soldiers and Scout Rangers, military officials said.
   ``The attempted coup by rebel soldiers has been crushed,''
Defense Minister Fidel Ramos said after dela Pena surrendered.
Scattered sniper fire around the camp was reported later although
there was no sign of substantial rebel forces in the area.
   In suburban Makati, the country's financial district, hundreds
of heavily armed rebels were still holding out in luxury hotels,
condominiums, banks and office buildings after battles broke out
Saturday. Military sources said it would be difficult to remove the
rebels because of the potential for damage and loss of civilian
life.
   Police had planned to attack the mutineers late Saturday, but
the rebels struck first, killing one policeman and wounding 14
others.
   Rebels fired volleys of machine-gun fire from Makati skyscrapers
and snipers shot at vehicles on Epifanio delos Santos Avenue.
   Radio station DZRH broadcast an appeal for ambulances, saying
many civilians lay wounded along Makati's Pasay Road.
   A spokesman for the U.S.-run Clark Air Base said there were no
American warplanes in the skies over Manila Sunday. U.S. military
planes began flying cover for government troops Friday, hours after
rebels launched their assaults, but American officials said the
U.S. planes ended those flights at 6 a.m. Saturday.
   A government spokesman said Mrs. Aquino and her family attended
Mass at the Malacanang Palace and prayed for an end to the carnage.
   The rebel shelling of Camp Aguinaldo set fire to the
Headquarters Service Company building and hundreds of military
families fled. Hospitals reported three people were killed and 25
wounded by the bombardment.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the Capital Defense Command,
said some mutinous marines infiltrated the camp, seizing the
chapel, dispensary and other small buildings near the main gate.
   He said the rebels smashed through the main gate with an armored
vehicle that was immediately hit by ground fire from the defenders
and the mutineers were unable to advance.
   The country's two international airports in Manila and Cebu
remained closed Sunday, and domestic flights were also canceled.
   In Makati, rebels roamed through the affluent shops and
Intercontinental Hotel Saturday. It was not known how many guests
were registered at the hotel. The guests were allowed to stay
inside, but mutineers ran other people out.
   Rebels blocked off a major street with commandeered trucks. One
mutineer said his group changed the color of its shoulder patches
from white to red ``because red is the color of blood, and we want
to shed blood for our cause.''
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said rebels
controlled parts of Manila and the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350
miles south of Manila.
   The army commander, Maj. Gen. Manuel Cacanando, estimated that
from 800 to 2,000 troopers had joined the revolt, the sixth
attempted coup against Mrs. Aquino in less than four years and the
most serious challenge to her government.
   Police said some assailants may be Communist insurgents seeking
to take advantage of confusion brought on by the revolt, which
began Friday when mutineers seized air force headquarters at
Villamor Air Base, the government television station and other
strongpoints. The rebels later gave up the air base and station.
   Warplanes had attacked rebel positions around Camp Aguinaldo
Saturday and the insurgents fired back with tanks, mortars and
machine guns.
   In one attack, air force jets accidentally strafed 2,000
pro-government troopers, killing six.
   Mrs. Aquino's failure to crush the 20-year-old Communist
insurgency is one reason for the discontent with her government,
particularly within the military. She also has been criticized for
not improving the Philippines' economy since coming to power in a
1986 military-civilian uprising that ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Military officials said one coup leader _ an associate of
renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who led an August
1987 coup try _ had been arrested.
   Rebel sources said Honasan was among the key planners of the
current coup attempt.
   Maj. Jose Gutierrez identified the rebel leader as Lt. Col. Tito
Legazpi and said he was arrested after taking part in an attack on
the Sangley Point naval air station outside Manila, which the
rebels briefly held.

   President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended two days of storm-tossed summitry Sunday
and said they were satisfied they had made progress toward a better
East-West relationship in a time of tumultuous change in Europe.
   But neither man pointed to a specific agreement on a key range
of arms control or other issues, and at an unprecedented joint news
conference, cited specific disagreements over weapons shipments to
leftist rebels in El Salvador and proposed naval arms reductions.
   The two men seemed at ease as they fielded questions aboard the
Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky, shaking hands and leaving the news
conference together at its conclusion.
   Gorbachev said he was ``encouraged and inspired'' by the changes
in Eastern Europe, where hardline regimes have been swept away in
recent weeks.
   Bush said the Soviet leader had ``laid to rest'' the Soviet
doctrine under which the Kremlin had invaded Hungary in 1956 and
Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   Gorbachev said that in his two days of talks with Bush, there
were ``elements of optimism and pessimism here and I wouldn't dwell
into the details.''
   ``It was a no agenda meeting, it accomplished everything I hoped
it would,'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev said there was no specific timetable for a new arms
agreement to cut long range nuclear forces by 50 percent, but he
hoped one could be agreed on before a summit set for next June in
the United States.
   The two men directed Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to meet again soon
on arms control issues.
   Gorbachev also said Bush had made a new proposal to reduce
chemical weapons that was positive, and that top-ranking officials
on both sides would be meeting to continue negotiating a treaty.
   Both Bush and Gorbachev stressed the importance of their
personal relationship, despite their repeated references to the
differences they found over the two days.
   ``We stated, both of us, that the world leaves the one epoch of
cold war and enters another epoch,'' he said. ``This is just the
beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our long road to a
longlasting peaceful period.''
   Near the end of their news conference, Gorbachev suggested
thanking reporters for their cooperation, but he added, ``although
of course we don't know what they've written yet or what they will
be writing.''
   Said Bush: ``Reserve the right to thank them afterwards you
mean? after we've seen what they've written?''
   Replied Gorbachev: ``No, right now, and they will write better.''
   Bush said the two men had begun to develop a future that ``can
realize a lasting peace and transform the East-West relationship.''
   But when asked about Gorbachev's desire for naval arms
reductions, he said he was ``disinclined to think that is an area
where we will make immediate progress.''
   Asked about Central America, where the United States has
complained about continued flow of Soviet arms to El Salvador
rebels, Bush said ``we had an in-depth discussion on these
questions as President Gorbachev has said.''
   He added, ``I can't say there are no differences between us, but
we had a chance to talk about them.''
   The two men fielded questions after ending nearly eight hours of
talks over two days that focused on arms control, trade, regional
conflicts in Central America and elsewhere as well as Europe.
   Bush was flying to Brussels after the summit to brief NATO
leaders on the summit talks. Gorbachev was going to Moscow to hold
a similar meeting with Warsaw Pact leaders _ many of them newly
installed as a result of Eastern European changes.
   Howling winds and heavy seas have plagued the summit throughout,
curtailing Saturday's sessions and forcing the leaders to meet
aboard a Soviet luxury liner rather than U.S. and Soviet warships.
But the rains that flooded this Mediterranean island abated Sunday,
and skies were gray but clearing.
   ``Long time, no see,'' Gorbachev told Bush at the opening of
Sunday's meeting.
   ``Back again,'' Bush said, smiling.
   ``You did a little sea travel,'' Gorbachev said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was wearing a medicinal
patch behind his ear to ward off seasickness, but White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was feeling ``terrific'' and
enjoying the rough weather.
   Gorbachev,'' he added, ``doesn't share our love of the sea.''
   As he was departing the USS Belknap, the president was asked if
the weather had made the summit a failure. ``Hell no. Hell no,'' he
replied. ``This summit's going just fine, thank you.''
   Said Bush: ``We don't care where we're meeting. The big thing is
we're getting something done, and it's good.
   Fitzwater said Bush attended a worship service aboard the USS
Belknap before leaving for the Soviet cruise ship.
   During a storm-shortened opening summit session Saturday, Bush
invited Gorbachev to the United States in the last two weeks of
June 1990, setting a target date for a meeting that was agreed on
last September.
   They worked to fix target dates for signing treaties that would
slash strategic nuclear arms, conventional forces in central Europe
and chemical weapons on both sides.
   Bush suggested signing a treaty providing a 30 percent to 50
percent cut in long-range nuclear arms by the June summit, and
signing an accord on reducing U.S. and Soviet ground forces in
Europe at a NATO-Warsaw Pact meeting in Vienna late next year.
   On Saturday, Bush took note of the dramatic changes under way in
Eastern Europe, where the Berlin Wall has crumbled and several
hardline Communist regimes have been swept aside recently, by
urging Gorbachev to join him in recommending that Berlin be the
site of the 2004 Olympic Games.
   Bush also expressed willingness to help the Soviet economy as a
means of bolstering the Gorbachev's domestic reforms. A White House
official, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, said
that if the Soviets pass a liberal emigration law that is being
pushed by Gorbachev, Bush will grant Moscow a range of trade favors.
   The assistance could include steps to grant the Soviet Union
most-favored-nation trading status, lower tariffs on Soviet imports
into the United States and observer status for the Soviets at the
97-nation General Agreement on Trade on Tariffs.

<TEXT>
   Communist leader Egon Krenz and his ruling
party Politburo resigned Sunday along with the Central Committee,
hounded from office by increasing demands from East Germany's
emboldened pro-democracy movement.
   Former hard-line party leader Erich Honecker was expelled from
the party he had led for 18 years until he was ousted and replaced
by Krenz on Oct. 18.
   Three recently fired Politburo members were arrested on
corruption charges, and a senior trade official fled East Germany.
   Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, who was generally
considered a reformer, announced the resignations of the 10-man
Politburo and the 163-member Central Committee on state radio.
   They came as the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee met in an emergency session following demands from the
burgeoning pro-democracy movement that Krenz, 52, resign. He was
jeered by party members Saturday.
   The resignations were the latest development in a historic
series of political changes that have transformed East Germany from
a hard-line Communist nation to one that is at the forefront of
Eastern Europe's reform movement.
   Under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus of
thousands, East Germany has thrown open its borders and the Berlin
Wall, and lawmakers eliminated the Communists' constitutionally
guaranteed leading role in society.
   In a deperate attempt to retain power and put a lid on the
pro-democracy movement, Krenz had promised the people that he would
investigate disclosures of corruption and high living among top
party officials.
   The Communist Party on Sunday expelled a large number of its
former leadership, including Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph
and former Parliament speaker Horst Sindermann, the state-run news
agency ADN said.
   The move came after growing calls for the resignations of Krenz
and the entire leadership amid charges of massive corruption in the
top party ranks.
   One of those arrested was the senior economic adviser to
Honecker.
   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a state secretary in the foreign
trade ministry, fled East Germany after authorities opened an
investigation against him for suspected illegal weapons sales, ADN
said Sunday.
   Schalck-Golodkowski was East Germany's chief trade negotiator
and had headed a department responsible for making hard-currency
sales.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said Schalck-Golodkowski was
stripped of his functions following his escape. ADN said he went to
West Germany on Saturday for trade talks and returned to East
Germany later the same day.
   Wolfgang Vogel, the country's most prominent lawyer, told
authorities early Sunday that Schalck-Golodkowski was ``at an
unknown location outside East Germany'' and that he had asked Vogel
to represent him, according to ADN.
   The investigation was opened after officials Saturday discovered
a secret operation to ship weapons to the Middle East, Africa and
South America, ADN said. Hard-currency earnings from the sales went
to the country's foreign trade bank addressed to
Schalck-Golodkowski, it said.
   On Saturday, 3,000 Communist Party members jeered Krenz and
whistled when he promised the party would investigate disclosures
of corruption and high living among top party officials. ``Too
late!'' they shouted.
   Ousted Politburo members Guenter Mittag and Harry Tisch were
taken into investigative custody suspected of ``heavily damaging
socialist property and the people's economy through abuse of
power,'' ADN said Sunday.
   Also arrested was Gerhard Mueller, a former party leader in the
city of Erfurt and former candidate member of the Politburo.
   Prosecutors issued the arrest warrants Saturday, and they were
apprehended later, the news agency said. It did not specify which
day.
   Mittag had been the senior economic adviser to Honecker. The
Communist Party has blamed the two for East Germany's economic
crisis and has begun a disciplinary investigation of them. Mittag
was ousted from the party last month.
   Tisch had been the chief of the Communist-run trade unions
federation until the organization expelled him on Nov. 27. He also
was removed from the ruling Politburo last month for allegedly
abusing his powers.
   Two other former high-ranking Communist officials were arrested
on Saturday. Hans Albrecht, the former party chief in the Suhl
region, and Walter Wolf, director of a large home construction
company in Suhl, were arrested under suspicion of ``fraudulently
damaging socialist property,'' ADN said without elaboaration.
   On Friday, lawmakers heard complaints at a parliamentary session
that top officials had taken bribes, indulged themselves with
luxuries at state expense and stashed away more than $54 billion in
foreign bank accounts.
   Since taking over from Honecker on Oct. 18, Krenz has begun a
program of sweeping reforms that includes promises of free
elections and abolition of the Communists' 40-year monopoly of
power.
   Krenz was jeered in a speech Saturday night outside the Central
Committee building. It was his latest attempt to distance himself
from the old hard-line leadership, of which he was a prominent
member. He has denied living opulently, as other leaders did under
Honecker.
   The lavish lifestyles of top party officials have been a major
source of discontent in a country where the average citizen has to
wait 10 years or more for a car.

   Embattled Communist leaders on
Sunday named five non-Communists to a new coalition government, but
an angered opposition called the appointments an ``outrage'' and
vowed to resume demonstrations.
   The Communists held on to 16 of the 21 Cabinet seats, including
the premiership and the powerful defense ministry, the state-run
media said. Thirteen members were holdovers from the previous
Communist Cabinet.
   The appointments were made by Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec
and President Gustav Husak, a hard-liner who took control of the
Communist Party after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed the democratic
``Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968. It is the first time
non-Communists have held top government positions since 1968.
   Jiri Dienstbier, a spokesman for Civic Forum, the nation's
largest opposition group, rejected the new government, saying: ``It
is more complicated than that.''
   He said Civic Forum would call another mass rally Monday at
Wenceslas Square, the focal point of two weeks of pro-democracy
protests that ended the Communists' 41-year monopoly on power.
   One Civic Forum leader, speaking on condition of anonymity,
called the new government an ``outrage,'' and said the Monday rally
would get Czechoslovakians back on the street.
   Striking students whose protest of police brutality at a Nov. 17
demonstration spurred the nation's peaceful revolt, laughed
derisively as they listened to a radio announcement of the new
Cabinet.
   ``It is a disappointment,'' said a strike leader, Michael Cech.
``We will now have to decide what to do.''
   Adamec, who opened negotiations with the opposition 12 days ago,
retained his post, the state-run news agency CTK reported.
   Among the new Communist appointees was Miroslav Vacek, who took
over the post of defense minister. Vacek, an army general, was
named despite an opposition demand that the ministry be headed by a
civilian.
   Vacek had served as deputy minister under former Defense
Minister Milan Vaclavik, also an army general.
   The new interior minister, Frantisek Pinc, is a civilian, as the
opposition had demanded, but he is a member of the Communist Party.
Civic Forum had demanded a non-Communist.
   Asked why Civic Forum's demands had not been fully met, Deputy
Premier Bohumil Urban told reporters, ``This is what life is like.
You can't take into account everybody's demands immediately.''
   But in a move obviously calculated to appease demands for more
religious freedom, Josef Hromadka, a high-ranking leader of
Czechoslovakia's Protestant church, was named one of seven deputy
premiers.
   Of the five non-Communists named to the government, three had no
official party affiliation. The new Cabinet appointees were for the
most part political unknowns.
   Adamec agreed Tuesday in talks with Civic Forum to appoint a new
government that would include non-Communists. He said last week
that many of the old Cabinet members had wanted to implement
reforms, but were unable to because of the hard-line policies of
the ruling Politburo.
   Dienstbier told The Associated Press on Saturday that the
opposition did not propose specific candidates for the new Cabinet,
but concentrated on outlining what characteristics office holders
should have.
   Communists, members of previously docile allied parties and
non-party people are acceptable to Civic Forum if they have no
obvious blemish in their past and are willing to implement reforms
now that will lead to free elections and genuine democracy,
Dienstbier said.
   Civic Forum, established only two weeks ago, is an umbrella
movement of opposition groups. Its leaders say they are not putting
themselves forward for Cabinet posts, but have left open the
possibility of accepting nominations.

<HEAD>Furriers Fight Back Against Animal Rights Protesters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American furriers are feeling the heat _ and it's
not from their mink coats.
   Increased pressure from animal rights advocates picketing fur
stores, holding annual ``Fur-Free Fridays'' and chanting slogans
like ``Buy a fur and slip into something dead'' have taken a toll.
   Now the fur industry is fighting back.
   Fur manufacturers, some facing financial losses, recently hired
one of the world's largest public relations agencies to represent
them and have paid for dramatic newspaper ads claiming activists
will soon tell people not to eat meat.
   ``If those people really want to be socially conscious, they
shouldn't wear gold jewelry or diamonds from South Africa or
leather shoes,'' said Gary Lennad, owner of Jay Lennad Furs, one of
the largest fur stores in the Boston area.
   Last month, the New York firm of Burson-Marsteller sent out kits
to fur retailers that included guidelines for handling the media
and dealing with anti-fur demonstrations. The kit also included a
hotline number for furriers faced with questions about the fur
trade and provided form letters for use in writing letters to the
editor.
   The fur industry also took out ads twice last month in The New
York Times Sunday editions that read, in part, ``Today fur.
Tomorrow leather, then wool. Then meat.''
   Fur farmers have also joined the effort. Marsha Kelly, associate
executive director of the Fur Farm Animal Welfare Coalition in St.
Paul, Minn., said the coalition is ``redoubling efforts to
re-educate the public about the industry.''
   Fur farmers are being briefed on issues, educational materials
about the fur industry are being sent to schools, and a
communications network has been established linking fur farmers
around the country, Kelly said.
   The public relations effort faces an uphill battle. Magazine and
billboard advertisements paid for by animal rights groups have
become increasingly more common _ and graphic.
   A full-page ad in this month's Spy magazine contains photographs
of a trapper approaching a fox whose leg is caught in a trap, then
standing on the animal and suffocating him.
   Ads at bus stops in New York City depict a leghold trap with a
raccoon's foot caught in it. Another print ad shows a simple
leghold trap accompanied by the words ``Get a Feel for Fur. Slam
Your Fingers in a Car Door.''
   Other anti-fur tactics are on the rise as well.
   The fourth annual ``Fur-Free Friday'' last month drew 2,500
animal rights activists in a march in New York City. Protesters
also targeted a dozen other cities.
   More than 140 celebrities, including Paul and Linda McCartney,
Kim Basinger, Carol Burnett, Art Linkletter and Christie Brinkley,
have signed anti-fur statements circulated by the animal rights
group Beauty Without Cruelty.
   Animal rights activists claim fur farming is inhumane and caters
to vanity. The furriers maintain that the protesters are infringing
on freedom of choice. They also claim that the fur industry is
strictly regulated and that animals receive excellent care.
   ``A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy,'' said Robert Meltzer,
president of Evans Inc. of Chicago, the nation's largest retailer
of fur, repeating a phrase used often by furriers and their
representatives. ``This is just the beginning for them. This is all
about freedom of choice. They're trying to take away First
Amendment rights.''
   Despite the hiring of Burson-Marsteller last summer and the
newspaper ads last month, the fur industry denies animal rights
protesters have had an impact on business. Most say the public
relations effort is an attempt to forestall any future harm.
   Though the fur industry tripled sales from 1979 to 1986, jumping
from $850 million yearly to $1.8 billion, the boom has since
leveled out. The Fur Vault, the country's second-largest American
fur chain, reported losses of over $7 million in the last two
years. Its retail operation is for sale. The two other publicly
held fur companies in the United States also reported recent
considerable quarterly earnings losses.
   But industry spokesmen insist business is basically good and
blame any losses on recent warm winters and a soft economy _ not
protesters.
   ``There's been no impact on business,'' said Richard Parsons,
executive director of the Fur Information Council of America. ``The
impetus (for the newspaper ads) was a feeling among the furriers
that the public was ready to hear from the fur industry. Our
customers were asking, what's the story?''

<HEAD>California State Senator Goes On Trial in Corruption Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful state senator goes on trial
Monday amid strong indications that the federal corruption
investigation that led to his indictment could result in charges
against two other lawmakers.
   State Sen. Joe Montoya, who chairs the Senate Business and
Professions Committee, has pleaded innocent to 12 felony counts
that accuse him of racketeering, extortion, bribery and money
laundering. Among the alleged victims of his shakedown efforts:
actor Ed Asner.
   If convicted, Montoya faces a maximum of 220 years in prison and
more than $3 million in fines.
   The Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of El Monte, who's been
in the Legislature for 17 years, is the first person to be tried as
a result of an investigation that began in 1985.
   The investigation included agents who posed as Alabama
businessmen seeking a bill to aid a shrimp-importing company they
hoped to establish, and a Senate aide who cooperated with the
agents by wearing a hidden recording device. The bill was
eventually passed, but Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tipped
off by the FBI, vetoed it.
   The probe became public in dramatic fashion in August 1988, when
30 federal agents raided the Capitol offices of Montoya, three
other lawmakers and their aides. There were reports that during the
raid, aides in some offices shredded documents and erased sensitive
computer information.
   Besides Montoya, one of his former aides, an Assembly aide, a
former Yolo County sheriff and a former undersheriff have also been
charged. And while prosecutors are saying little about the
investigation, a plea bargain reached last week could mean at least
two other lawmakers will face charges.
   Karin Watson, a key aide to Assembly Republicans, pleaded guilty
Tuesday to one extortion count and agreed to help prosecutors. That
development could spell trouble for the two Republican Assembly
members whose offices were searched 15 months ago, Pat Nolan of
Glendale and Frank Hill of Whittier.
   According to papers filed in the case, Watson played a key role
in setting up two meetings in June 1988 at which $12,500 was paid
to an undercover agent. News articles have linked Nolan and Hill to
those meetings. Both have denied wrongdoing.
   Montoya's attorney, Michael Sands, refused to discuss the case
last week. But Sands said in an earlier interview that he was
``convinced that Montoya's position can be sustained.''
   According to Senate aides, defense attorneys have subpoenaed
about half the 40 members of the Senate to testify at the trial,
apparently in an attempt to show that Montoya's actions were not
out of the ordinary.
   Among other things, Montoya is accused of accepting a $3,000
``honorarium'' from an undercover agent in exchange for help in
getting the bill to help the fictional shrimp business through the
Senate.
   The charge alleging an extortion attempt against Asner stems
from a 1985 meeting, at the time the popular actor, known for his
roles in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Lou Grant'' and
``Roots,'' was president of the Screen Actors Guild.
   According to a memorandum filed by prosecutors last month, Asner
and a lobbyist for the guild went to see Montoya in May 1985 to
seek his vote against a bill their union opposed.
   ``Montoya took the two into his office and closed the door,''
the memorandum said. ``He then stated in no uncertain terms that he
did not see why he should support the guild since the guild had not
made financial contributions to him.''
   The memo said Asner and the lobbyist were ``infuriated and
disgusted'' and the meeting ended abruptly. Montoya voted against
the guild's side that afternoon, the memo added.
   In another incident, prosecutors alleged, Montoya wrote letters
to all California high school principals, urging them not to insure
their athletes with a particular insurance company. The letters
were written after the company's owner refused to pay Montoya
$10,000 for support of legislation backed by the company, the
memorandum said.
   A key figure in the investigation, the memorandum said, was John
Shahabian, a Senate staffer who tried to extort an undercover agent
and then agreed to cooperate with the FBI in exchange for lenient
treatment.
   In June 1988, Shahabian asked an unidentified legislator what it
would take to get the shrimp legislation out of the Senate Banking
and Commerce Committee, the memorandum said.
   ``Well, you need to make some arrangements with Joe,'' the
lawmaker reportedly told Shahabian. ``What it'll take with Joe is a
little envelope.''
   Later that month, Shahabian, wearing a hidden recording device,
went to see Montoya. Montoya asked if the organizers of shrimp deal
were ``doing well,'' and learning that they were, replied, ``OK, so
they can be helpful.''
   Later in the conversation, after Montoya was assured that the
bill would attract little attention, Shahabian asked, ``How can we
be helpful to you?''
   ``Either way, (campaign) contributions and@or honorariums,''
Montoya reportedly said. A luncheon meeting was set up with the
undercover agent, at which time the $3,000 check was passed to
Montoya, the memo said.

<HEAD>Rare Toxic Algae Bloom in Lake Near Tacoma, Wash.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A rare algae toxin in a suburban lake
killed two cats, said health officials who want people to stay away
from the deadly water. The soupy, blue-green masses of algae in
American Lake are so toxic that a few glassfuls of contaminated
water could kill a human being, said Tacoma-Pierce County Health
Department officials.
   So far, officials have found the toxin only in a northern cove
of the lake. Its presence was confirmed Friday.
   Signs and leaflets were being distributed, and further tests in
the lake and others were planned Monday, said Kim Coble, head of
the agency's water resource section.
   The toxic algae normally live two weeks to a month, but health
officials plan to kill it with copper sulphate Monday. The chemical
itself is toxic, but it must be used in this case because of the
danger of the algae, Coble said.
   ``It's pretty rough environmentally, but we're worried that the
wind might shift and it (the algae) could spread,'' she said.
   The toxin affects the nervous system, and most mammals killed by
it die of respiratory failure. There have been no recorded
toxin-related human deaths in the state.
   Health officials confirmed the toxin was in the lake after
testing at Pacific Lutheran University showed that mice injected
with it died within minutes. Emergency rooms and veterinarians were
alerted to watch for signs of the algae toxin in patients.
   ``It suddenly turned into an emergency,'' Coble said.
   The tests followed an autopsy on two cats taken to the health
department a week ago. Green matter was found in their stomachs and
on their fur, indicating they probably ingested the toxin by
cleaning their coats.
   W.T. Edmondson, a retired University of Washington professor who
specializes in lake ecology, said no one knows exactly what
triggers the usually harmless algae to produce the toxin, but
sewage appears to play a key role.
   The toxin is common in the Midwest and has killed cattle and
other large mammals, he said.

   Cincinnati Bell and two fired employees resume
a court fight Monday over whether the company made the two men set
1,200 illegal wiretaps, including one on President Ford's hotel
telephones during a 1976 visit.
   Cincinnati Bell is suing Leonard Gates and Robert Draise for
defamation, alleging they lied to damage the company's reputation
after they were dismissed.
   Gates and Draise are countersuing for $11 million, contending
their reputations were damaged when the company said they lied.
   The two men contend that Cincinnati Bell is a longtime
lawbreaker and that the company's lawsuit is an attemptces were
searched 15 months ago, Pat Nolan of Glendale and Frank Hill of
Whittier.
   According to papers filed in the case, Watson played a key role
in setting up two meetings in June 1988 at which $12,500 was paid
to an undercover agent. News articles have linked Nolan and Hill to
those meetings. Both have denied wrongdoing.
   Montoya's attorney, Michael Sands, refused to discuss the case
last week. But Sands said in an earlier interview that he was
``convinced that Montoya's position can be sustained.''
   According to Senate aides, defense attorneys have subpoenaed
about half the 40 members of the Senate to testify at the trial,
apparently in an attempt to show that Montoya's actions were not
out of the ordinary.
   Among other things, Montoya is accused of accepting a $3,000
``honorarium'' from an undercover agent in exchange for help in
getting the bill to help the fictional shrimp business through the
Senate.
   The charge alleging an extortion attempt against Asner stems
from a 1985 meeting, at the time the popular actor, known for his
roles in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Lou Grant'' and
``Roots,'' was president of the Screen Actors Guild.
   According to a memorandum filed by prosecutors last month, Asner
and a lobbyist for the guild went to see Montoya in May 1985 to
seek his vote against a bill their union opposed.
   ``Montoya took the two into his office and closed the door,''
the memorandum said. ``He then stated in no uncertain terms that he
did not see why he should support the guild since the guild had not
made financial contributions to him.''
   The memo said Asner and the lobbyist were ``infuriated and
disgusted'' and the meeting ended abruptly. Montoya voted against
the guild's side that afternoon, the memo added.
   In another incident, prosecutors alleged, Montoya wrote letters
to all California high school principals, urging them not to insure
their athletes with a particular insurance company. The letters
were written after the company's owner refused to pay Montoya
$10,000 for support of legislation backed by the company, the
memorandum said.
   A key figure in the investigation, the memorandum said, was John
Shahabian, a Senate staffer who tried to extort an undercover agent
and then agreed to cooperate with the FBI in exchange for lenient
treatment.
   In June 1988, Shahabian asked an unidentified legislator what it
would take to get the shrimp legislation out of the Senate Banking
and Commerce Committee, the memorandum said.
   ``Well, you need to make some arrangements with Joe,'' the
lawmaker reportedly told Shahabian. ``What it'll take with Joe is a
little envelope.''
   Later that month, Shahabian, wearing a hidden recording device,
went to see Montoya. Montoya asked if the organizers of shrimp deal
were ``doing well,'' and learning that they were, replied, ``OK, so
they can be helpful.''
   Later in the conversation, after Montoya was assured that the
bill would attract little attention, Shahabian asked, ``How can we
be helpful to you?''
   ``Either way, (campaign) contributions and@or honorariums,''
Montoya reportedly said. A luncheon meeting was set up with the
undercover agent, at which time the $3,000 check was passed to
Montoya, the memo said.

<HEAD>Small Businesses Bailing Out of Pension Plans Because of Complex
Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of small businesses across the
country are ditching their employee pension plans, saying federal
rules make the benefit programs too costly and complex to maintain.
   Employers claim congressional tinkering with a 1974 pension law
has dramatically increased the paperwork, accountants and
administrative personnel needed to comply with the law.
   ``It's impossible,'' said Ronald Turner, a third generation
lumber company owner in Clarksburg, W.Va. ``We're going to drop the
plan.''
   Alvin D. Lurie, a former assistant commissioner for the Internal
Revenue Service, says Turner is typical of small business owners
who tried but failed to keep current with the ever-changing
provisions of the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
   ``It has become much, much too complicated,'' said Lurie, now
chairman of the New York Bar Association's Special Committee on
Pension Simplification. ``It's frightful. People can't afford it,
don't understand it.''
   A San Antonio, Texas, attorney who handles the pension plans for
several hundred small businesses said he is advising his clients to
drop them. A Santa Ana, Calif., plan administrator said about 30
percent of the small businesses she works with are terminating
their programs.
   But some say the business owners are simply using regulations as
an excuse.
   ``I don't think it's that clear cut that the (congressional)
revisions have led small businesses to drop their plans,'' a Senate
Labor Committee aide said, asking that she not be further
identified. ``I'm skeptical because they can go into simplified
plans.''
   Many of the employers bailing out of the federally insured
pension plans are setting up profit-sharing or other programs seen
as less beneficial to employees because they usually require the
workers to put up some of the money.
   The pension law, known as ERISA, was enacted by Congress to
protect the 76 million American workers with pension plans and
their $2 trillion in pension assets. Always complex, the law saw a
series of amendments over the years that proved, in some cases,
expensive or frustrating for employers.
   The Labor Department's inspector general's office, cautioning
that the pension system is open to fraud and embezzlement, wants
Congress to enact additional laws to prevent possible abuses.
   ``I think the people writing the laws are trying to be fair and
equitable, but they don't understand what the costs mean,'' said
Paula Calamafde, a tax lawyer and head of the Small Business
Council of America.
   Turner, who plans to give his employees the cash due to them
from the pension fund, said he always tried to keep up with the
laws. The required paperwork grew from 35 pages to 77 pages this
year, he said.
   Then the IRS came in to check out his plan and disqualified it
on a technicality. His report lacked this phrase: ``These are the
rules we will follow if the plan becomes top heavy,'' a measure
designed to prevent employers from favoring top management.
   ``We felt like the Gestapo had been turned loose on us,'' he
said. ``It's not fair. I have always told the Internal Revenue I'll
do what ever I have to do to stay qualified.''
   The Social Security Administration says the number of full-time
workers with employer-financed pension plans fell to 46 percent
last year, down from 50 percent in 1979. Only 29 percent of the
workers in companies employing between 25 and 49 workers have such
plans, while 67 percent of those in companies of 250 workers or
more are covered.
   The federal insurer of private pension plans, the Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation, received 10,790 notices of planned
termination in fiscal 1988. But the organization, already $1.5
billion in the red, does not separate large from small businesses.
   Business owners are required to notify the IRS, the PBGC and all
plan participants before they end pension plans.
   Chet Salkind, executive director of the New York-based American
Society of Pension Actuaries, said there has been a constant
decline in employer-financed plans and an increase in programs in
which employees contribute, such as the 401 (k) savings plans.
   ``From the employee angle there's a tremendous difference,''
Salkind explained. ``Usually it's employee money and not a
guaranteed amount.''
   Donna Hopson, a plan administrator and president of the Santa
Ana, Calif.-based National Institute of Pension Administrators,
said her office used to see about four plan terminations a year but
that this year there have been about 60 terminations among her 250
clients.
   Employers who end the plans pay their workers the amount
accrued, but Ms. Hopson said bailing out undermines the nation's
retirement program.
   ``The feedback I get is they take the money and spend it,'' she
said.
   Ms. Hopson puts the blame on laws that add to the cost of
compliance, requiring detailed reports, accountants, actuaries and
plan administrators.
   ``We can't spend the amount of time necessary to keep the plan
updated and comply with the provisions,'' said a Maryland employer
who spoke on condition of anonymity because she is still in the
process of terminating her plan. ``It took two months of my time.''
   A Virginia restaurant owner, who asked not to be further
identified because ``I don't trust the IRS,'' said he dropped his
employer-paid plan and set up a profit-sharing program.
   ``With a profit-sharing plan I can put into it whatever I
want,'' he said, adding that the government required him to put
$113,000 into his employer-paid pension plan last year.

<TEXT>
   Q. Did you assure President Bush that the changes in Eastern
Europe are irreversible, that the Soviet Union has foresaken the
right to intervene there militarily? And President Bush, similarly,
as a result of this meeting, are you now more trusting that the
Soviets have, indeed, renounced the Brezhnev Doctrine?
   Q. A most important question from Czechoslovakia for Mr.
Gorbachev. Will Soviets renounce the Brezhnev Doctrine which
enabled the Soviets to invade Czechoslovakia in 1968?
   GORBACHEV: I don't want to be understood as being authorized to
speak on behalf of all Eastern European countries. This would not
be in keeping with the facts. We are part of Eastern Europe
certainly; we are part of Europe as a whole, too. And we work
together with our allies in all areas. We have profound ties, but
each country is an independent power, an independent factor in
world politics. And each people has the right to decide, and does
decide the fate of its own state.
   All I can say is my view. And I think that these changes in the
Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries, as an objective
fact, have been caused by the actual historic process itself, and
no one can avoid that. It's a problem whose time has come. We have
to solve it by new means, using our experience and the potential
which these states have accumulated, and also opening up
opportunities for the use of everything that's been a positive
accumulated in human experience. And I think the orientation of
these processes is something that we should welcome because it's
connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their
societies, to make them more democratic, humanitarian, to open up
to the rest of the world. So I'm encouraged and inspired by all
these processes, and I'm sure this is the way they are understood
and appreciated by other peoples.
   Of course, I also see that there are processes going on,
profound processes of change in Western countries, too, including
Western European countries. And this is very important, too.
There's a kind of a movement bringing states, countries, and
continents together. But nevertheless, there are processes where
each individual country prefers its commitments, its choices, and
its individualities. That's very important, and it's important for
all of us to understand that.
   Q. I'm speaking on behalf of a group of Czechoslovak ...
   BUSH: And as President Gorbachev talks about democratic change,
and peaceful, that certainly lays to rest previous doctrines that
may have had a different approach. And so we are _ he knows, and
not just the president, but all the people in the United States
would like to see this peaceful, democratic evolution continue. And
so I think that's the best way to answer the question, because the
change is so dramatic and so obvious to people. But I will say we
had a very good chance to discuss it in considerably more detail
than I think would be appropriate to discuss it here.
   Q. President Bush, you have accused the Soviet Union for sending
arms to El Salvador, to Central America, and President Gorbachev,
you have denied those charges. Now both of you are sitting here
together, who is right?
   BUSH: Maybe I ought to take the first shot at that one. I don't
think we accused the Soviet Union of that. What we did say is arms
were going in there in an unsatisfactory way. My view is that not
only did the Nicaraguans acquiesce in it, but they encouraged in it
_ encouraged that to happen. And the evidence is demonstrable.
   But I'm not challenging whether _ the word of the foreign
minister. He and Jim Baker talked about that, and President
Gorbachev and I talked about it. All I know is that _ and he said
it earlier, elections _ free elections is _ should be the mode. And
I also reported to him what Mr. Oscar Arias called me about,
blaming Castro and the Sandinistas for exporting revolution and for
just tearing things up there in Central America. So we may have a
difference on that one, but I want to be careful when you say I
accused them of sending these weapons. I did not, because Mr.
Shevardnadze made a direct representation to Mr. Baker. And
everyone knows that there's a wide international arms flow out
there, but whatever it is, however it comes, it is unsatisfactory
for countries in the region that want to see the evolution toward
democracy continue.
   GORBACHEV: The president has quite rightly reported our
discussion on this. There was no accusation made against us and we
didn't have to accept or reject such an accusation, therefore. We
told the president that we have assurances _ firm assurances from
Nicaragua that no deliveries using certain aircraft actually were
carried out. President Bush didn't agree with that and we heard
that also. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the principle, I
said, and President Bush confirmed this, that we're in favor of
free elections. We want to see this conflict ended by political
means, and we want to see a normalization of the situation there.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: That's what we agreed on. I agreed _ I agree
that that's where the _
   Q What about the accusations of Oscar Arias on Cuba?
   BUSH: _ that that's the assessment. I still feel that arms are
going into El Salvador. We've seen clear evidence of it, and _ but
I can't argue with the factual presentation made here. But we have
a difference. I don't believe that the Sandinistas have told the
truth to our Soviet friends. And why? Because we know for a fact
certain that arms have gone in there. I'm not saying they're Soviet
arms. They've said they aren't shipping arms and I'm accepting
that. But they're going in there and I am saying that they have
misled Mr. Shevardnadze when they gave a specific representation
that no arms were going from Nicaragua into El Salvador. And that's
_ so we have some differences in how we look at this key question.
And the best way to have those differences ameliorated is to have
these certifiably free elections in Nicaragua.
   And Castro _ I have no influence with him whatsoever. And maybe
somebody is yelling that question at President Gorbachev. But look,
we've got some differences in different places around the world.
   Q. President Gorbachev, what about the accusations of President
Arias on _ about Cuba? Oscar Arias apparently called President Bush
and told him that Cuba really created the situation in the region.
It was fomenting revolution in _

   GORBACHEV: We discussed the situation in Latin America,
expressed our views on the basis of our own analysis and our own
assessment, said to the president that the conditions are ripe for
changing the situation for the better. The different sides do have
a wish to do this, to normalize the situation, not only in the
region but also in the United States.
   Q. How do you assess the German situation?
   GORBACHEV: Do you want to begin on the German question?
   BUSH: I'd be glad ... Somebody better tell me what the question
was then, if I'm going to answer. Was it the question of Germany?
The United States, part of NATO, has had a longstanding position.
Helsinki spells out permanent borders. We _ I made clear to
President Gorbachev that we, for our part, do not want to do
anything that is unrealistic, and causes any country to end up
going backwards, or end up having its own people in military
conflict, one with the other.
   And so, I think we have tried to act with the word that
President Gorbachev has used to _ and that is, ``with caution,''
not to go demonstrating on top of the Berlin Wall to show how happy
we are about the change. We are happy about the change. And the
German question is _ I've heard many leaders speak about the German
question, and I don't think it is the role of the United States to
_ to dictate the rapidity of change in any country. It's a matter
for the people to determine themselves. So that's our position, and
the last word goes to the chairman on this one.
   GORBACHEV: Yes, on that as he ended, the president wrote in
English and I don't read English. I answered him in Russian and he
doesn't read Russian. But, we agreed. (Laughter.)
   BUSH: No matter what it said. ...
   GORBACHEV: I have several times expressed my views on this
point, and because we discussed it with the president, we
considered all these questions on the condition of the Helsinki
process. We realize that the real situation in Europe, the current
situation in Europe is that in modern Europe there are two German
states, Federal Republic of Germany and German Democratic Republic.
   Well, there are two German states in Europe today, the Federal
Republic and the German Democratic Republic. They are members of
the United Nations, sovereign states. This is the bidding of
history, this is what history has willed. I always have recourse to
this argument. So as to remain realistic, we must understand that
history does dictate the fate and the processes on the continent,
and also determines the role and place of these two states.
   And we think that there is an understanding today in the minds
of all. And any artificial attempt to do anything to that process _
well, we mustn't do anything to belittle the great significance of
the great changes which are happening in this continent. It's a
central part of contemporary history. It would not be _ we don't
want to do anything to accelerate these changes artificially for
the peoples of these two great German states.
   Can we thank the press for its cooperation? Of course, we don't
know what they've written yet, and what they will be writing.
(Laughter.)
   BUSH: Reserve the right to thank them afterward, you mean? After
they've written?
   GORBACHEV: No. I think right now, and they will write better.
I'd like to thank you for your cooperation.
   BUSH: We do have to leave at 1:20 _ should we each take one more
question or not? Agreeable? All right, last one _ last one for me
right here. No rebuttal, no back up question. The last one.
   Q. What's your personal relationship now between the two _
(inaudible) _ and would regular contacts that would perhaps no
longer be called summits be helpful?
   BUSH: I had known President Gorbachev before and I'll let him
speak for himself, but I think we have a good personal relationship
and I believe that helps each side be frank, point out the
differences as well as the areas we agree on. And that is a very,
very important ingredient, I think, because of the standing of the
two powers and because of the dramatic change that is taking place.
And I am not saying that if he likes me, he is going to change
longheld policies, and I'm going to say if I like him, we're not
going to change longheld policies.
   But what we've been able to do here is to get together and talk
about the differences without rancor and as frankly as possible.
And I think it's been very constructive. So I couldn't have asked
for a better result out of this non-summit summit. (Laughter.) And
the question is regular meetings? I'm open for _ to see him as much
as it requires to keep things moving forward. We've already set a
summit meeting. That summit meeting will drive the arms control
agenda. And that's a good thing, because I represented to him that
we wanted to see a START agreement, a CFE agreement, and hopefully
a chemical agreement. That's a very ambitious agenda. But I think
if we hadn't sat here and talked we might not have understood how
each other feels on these important questions.
   GORBACHEV: I'd like to confirm what's just been said by
President Bush, that we've known each other for quite a long time
now. I'd just like to add that perhaps _ of course we didn't agree
on this with the president, and I don't think I'm disclosing a
great secret, that we've already had detailed discussions when we
had our previous contacts, and we informed each other of each
other's positions basically.
   At Governor's Island or in the automobiles, we've had
discussions, and we've had correspondence subsequently. And this
meeting we've had here has made our personal contacts, placed them
on a different level, and I'm very happy with the meeting we've
had, the talks we've had, two talks one-on-one.
   Like the president, I do feel that personal contact is a very
important factor in relations between political leaders,
particularly of such states as the Soviet Union and the United
States. And I am committed to the idea of personal contacts.
Although, as I said to the _ as the president said correctly, this
doesn't mean that for the sake of personal contacts, we can back
away from our positions or can forget our responsibilities. No,
it's's just that personal contacts makes it possible for us the
better to carry out our responsibilities and work together more
effectively and more effective cooperation in the interest of our
two peoples and in interests of the whole world community.
   On my own behalf I'd like to thank you for this meeting. Thank
you, Mr. President, for your cooperation for Soviet-American
endeavors.
   BUSH: Thank you, sir. Well, I guess we're going to fly away to
Brussels.

Aunt Bee</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SILER CITY, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's got the usual fast-food
restaurants, video-rental stores, three banks and a department
store. But there's something else that makes this town of 5,000
more than just a spot on the map.
   It's the home of Aunt Bee, the devoted, loveable matron who
looked after Sheriff Andy Taylor and his son, Opie, on ``The Andy
Griffith Show.''
   Born 86 years ago in New York, actress Frances Bavier chose to
retire to this town after a career that included Broadway as well
as television. The town is in the same region as the fictional
Mayberry, N.C.
   Though she's avoided interviews and contacts with visiting fans
over the years, and has been ailing lately, she's made friends
among the folks here. And everyone calls her ``Aunt Bee.''
   ``Every year at some time or another, people get it in their
head to check up on Aunt Bee,'' says Velma Sadler, the Police
Department records clerk and a 12-year friend of Ms. Bavier. ``It's
just a shame this year's influx coincides with Aunt Bee being in
the hospital.''
   Ms. Bavier was admitted to the coronary care unit of Chatham
Hospital here the day before Thanksgiving. Hospital officials say
they're not releasing any details at her request and that doesn't
surprise most residents.
   ``She's an extremely private individual, and she's let that be
known,'' said Wanda Ingold, town clerk.
   Sometimes, admiring or curious outsiders have made life
difficult.
   ``We'll get people in here all the time asking what her address
is or for directions to her house,'' said police detective Sgt.
Alphonzo Craven.
   ``We get television crews and reporters down here all the time
trying to get some information,'' Craven said. ``They ask questions
like `Is there an Andy Taylor sheriff here? Is there a deputy like
Barney Fife?' It's ridiculous. All Aunt Bee wants is to be left
alone. That's why she came here _ to retire in peace.''
   Before her role as Beatrice Taylor in the long-running 1960s
series starring Griffith as a Southern sheriff, Ms. Bavier appeared
in such Broadway productions as ``Kiss and Tell,'' ``Point of No
Return,'' and ``The Lady Says No.''
   When she retired in the early 1970s, she moved from Los Angeles
to Siler City, one of a number of towns that had invited her to
appear at celebrations over the years. Like Mount Airy, the town on
which Griffith loosely based Mayberry, it is in the hilly Piedmont
region between the coast and the Appalachians.
   ``I guess when she came down here to do parades and other
events, she just liked the people,'' Ms. Sadler said. ``It really
is a nice area and the people are extremely nice.''
   ``Sure, there might have been a fuss when she first moved
here,'' said town tax collector Dottie Mendenhall. ``Now she's just
another resident to the people who live here.''
   Ms. Sadler describes Ms. Bavier as ``extremely nice to me ...
nothing but a good friend. We talk about museums, operas, plays
we've both seen. Why she moved here or her days on the show really
never came up.
   ``She's an elderly, ailing, sick woman.''
   Siler City has a different aura from the fictional Mayberry, but
it's still a family-oriented community. Women walking into the
Glendale hosiery mill's outlet store are greeted by name.
   ``That's just the way things are around here,'' Ms. Sadler said.
``I think that's why Aunt Bee probably moved here. We have our
problems like anyplace, but it really is a nice place to live.''

   President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved closer together at their Mediterranean
summit to curb the nuclear and conventional arms races and drop the
curtain on the Cold War.
   But they also discovered that the pace of events, especially in
Eastern Europe, is rapidly outstripping the capacity of the two
most powerful leaders in the world to shape the future.
   Even as Bush and Gorbachev were winding up their two-day
near-summit on Sunday the entire Politburo and Communist party
Central Committee resigned in East Germany. Orthodox communism is
on the run, crumbling faster than anyone had predicted.
   And while Bush was jetting here Thursday night from Washington a
friendly but troubled government in the Philippines teetered on the
edge of a military coup. Bush's preparations for the summit had to
compete with evaluating the threat to President Corazon Aquino and
the extent of U.S. military intervention deemed necessary to
protect her.
   Even Mother Nature gave the two superpower leaders a
stomach-tossing display of how unpredictable the universe can be.
Stormy seas forced them to rearrange their schedule and cancel both
a Saturday afternoon meeting and a dinner that night.
   Despite it all, Bush and Gorbachev found common ground on the
direction they would like the world to take, and that the road
ahead is a long one. And while there were no arms-control
breakthroughs or specific timetables set for treaty-signings, the
two mutually pledged to work to that end.
   ``We stated, both of us, that the world leaves the one epoch of
Cold War and enters another epoch,'' Gorbachev said. ``This is just
the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our long road
to a long-lasting peaceful period.''
   The tentative nature of their joint venture is reflected in the
absence of any concrete agreements, and the evident failure of Bush
to halt the delivery of Soviet arms to rebels in El Salvador.
   The pipeline, which the administration claims runs through Cuba
and Nicaragua, was denounced by Secretary of State James A. Baker
II on the eve of the summit, as ``a relic of the Cold War.''
   U.S. officials said Gorbachev, in discussing the explosive issue
with Bush, professed not to know how the anti-aircraft launchers
and other arms got to the leftist FMLN forces.
   Perhaps mindful of fast-paced events in East Germany and in all
other Warsaw Pact countries except Romania, the Soviet leader also
spoke modestly of U.S. and Soviet powers to manage history.
   ``In our position,'' Gorbachev said, ``the most dangerous thing
is to exaggerate. We always should preserve elements of
cautiousness. I have used the favorite word of President Bush.''
   The reference to Bush's political style draw laughter from
reporters assembled aboard the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky.
   But Bush was serious about the leaders' limitations as well as
the expectations for a meeting he refused to call a summit.
   ``It is not for the United States and the Soviet Union to design
the future for Europeans,'' he said, ``or for any other people. I
am convinced that a cooperative U.S.-Soviet relationship can indeed
make the future safer and brighter.''
   In that vein, Bush and Gorbachev determined to speed the
completion of three arms control accords _ to banish chemical
weapons, reduce long-range nuclear missiles by 30 to 50 percent,
and to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional
forces in Europe.
   On the other hand, the summit produced no specific accords to
attain those goals. Nor did the leaders establish a schedule for
completing the three treaties, although they both said they hoped
to place their signatures on a nuclear arms cut when they meet next
summer in the United States.
   It is one thing to urge negotiators on, and another to make the
sort of command decisions that breaks deadlocks.
   Gorbachev underscored how much remains to be done. For instance,
he would like a ceiling placed on warships as part of the
disarmament process. Bush disagrees. The U.S. Navy will be reduced,
but only by domestic budget constraints and not at the negotiating
table.
   And no deal was struck to limit nuclear-tipped cruise missiles
carried aboard submarines and surface ships. That is the touchiest
issue in the strategic weapons field.
   On the conventional arms front, meanwhile, Gorbachev registered
the Kremlin's complaint with NATO attempts to trim thousands of
Soviet airplanes that the Kremlin claims have a defense mission.
   Repeatedly, however, Bush stressed the common ground he found
with Gorbachev. He also made U.S. support for perestroika, the
restructuring of the Soviet economy, concrete with an offer of
trading privileges.
   ``It was a no agenda meeting, it accomplished everything I hoped
it would,'' Bush said.

   The Defense Ministry newspaper said Sunday that
the Western arms policy, including U.S. refusal to reduce its naval
forces, still is based on confrontation and threatens efforts to
ease tensions with Eastern Europe.
   ``There is little optimism in the fact that military budgets and
programs in the United States and other NATO countries still regard
military force as the major means of achieving designated foreign
policy goals,'' Red Star said in a commentary written by Vasily
Pustov.
   The newspaper printed the commentary as Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and President Bush completed talks in Malta and
expressed optimism at plans for arms reductions.
   However, the leaders also cited their disagreement over proposed
naval arms reductions.
   Red Star said both East and West must change their outlook to
improve international relations.
   ``In the current stage of transition in international
development, it is all the more obvious that the path to a stable
world and mutual security lies through serious changes not only in
the East, but in the West,'' the newspaper said in a commentary.
   It praised signs of change in some North Atlantic Treat
Organization countries, specifically consideration of military cuts
in West Germany and the United States.
   But, it added, ``some actions by NATO and its leading members
appear to be a glaring anachronism against the background of
improving international climate.''
   Pustov said the unwillingness of NATO and the United States to
include its superior naval forces in negotiations with the Soviet
Union were alarming. ``This puts in doubt, and even threatens much
of what has been achieved in the area of limiting weapons as a
result of long and difficult negotiations.''
   Top Soviet military officials previously have expressed concern
about U.S. naval superiority even as the two sides try to work out
an agreement to reduce their coventional forces in Europe.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the former military chief of staff
and a Gorbachev adviser, said in the Communist Party daily Pravda
in October that the United States has 2{ times more large-surface
ships, 15 attack aircraft carriers to none for the Soviets, 2{
times more maritime aircraft and 19 times more marines.
   ``The U.S.A., most likely, intends to continue using these
forces to put pressure on us and threaten the Soviet Union,'' he
said.
   Red Star cited NATO doctrine that regards nuclear deterrence as
a condition for constructive talks with the Warsaw Pact, and the
Western view that the presence of U.S. conventional and nuclear
forces is ``vitally important for European security.''
   Bush flew to Brussels, Belgium, after the summit Sunday to
discuss the talks with NATO allies. Gorbachev flew to Moscow, where
he will meet with the Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact allies this week.

<TEXT>
   Following is the official English
translation of a position paper on the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
that the newly formed Czechoslovak government released Sunday:
   The government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic considers
the entry into Czechoslovakia of the armies of the five states of
the Warsaw Treaty in 1968 as an infringement to the norms of
relations amongst sovereign states. The federal government entrusts
its chairman, Ladislav Adamec, to inform the Soviet government of
this position.
   The federal government proposes, at the same time, to the
government of the Soviet Union to open negotiations on an
inter-government agreement which concerns the temporary stay of the
Soviet troops on the territory of the Czechoslovak Socialist
Republic. It entrusts the minister of foreign affairs, Jaromir
Johanes, to conduct the negotiations. It premises that the question
of the departure of the Soviet troops must be settled in conformity
with the advance of the European disarmament process.
   The government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is
prepared, together with the other countries involved, to create a
group of historians who would consider, from all angles, the
context of the events of August 1968. It entrusts the first deputy
chairman of the government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic,
Marian Calfa, to open talks on the creation of this group.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa rested
comfortably Sunday, two days after surgeons implanted a pacemaker
to regulate her heartbeat, hospital sources said.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was admitted on Wednesday to
Woodlands Nursing Home hospital with high blood pressure and
dizziness.
   ``She is doing fine,'' a hospital source said Sunday.
   Mother Teresa, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work
among the poor, suffered a heart attack in September.
   Doctors had attributed the illness to her hectic schedule at the
Missionaries of Charity.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the charity in October 1959 in an
abandoned hostel donated by the city. The order, which was formally
recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has 3,000 nuns
working in 87 countries.

<HEAD>Report Cites Serious Lapse in Security at Nuclear Weapons Lab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret inspection of a federal nuclear
weapons laboratory in California found serious security lapses last
spring, including poor protection of large amounts of plutonium,
according to a congressional report released Sunday.
   The report also said the Energy Department from 1982 through
1988 misled the president, in its annual reports to the White
House, about the adequacy of measures to protect weapons-grade
nuclear materials from potential theft or sabotage.
   The report included a declassified transcript of a closed
hearing last July in which several senior Energy Department
officials testified on security and safeguards weaknesses in the
nuclear weapons production and design complex.
   The hearing was held by the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations. Portions of the
hearing transcript and department documents were deleted by the
department.
   The subcommittee is continuing to investigate the department's
nuclear weapons facilities, which in recent months have been
wracked by allegations of health, safety and environmental
violations. Some key plants have been closed temporarily.
   In the hearing transcript, portions of a previously secret
report by Edward J. McCallum, director of the department's weapons
security evaluations office, were published. These included a
passage highly critical of nuclear materials protection at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, near Livermore, Calif.
   The Livermore lab has come under fire in recent years for
illegal drug use by some employees, alleged ethics and
conflict-of-interest violations by senior lab officials and charges
of theft of government property from the facility.
   The lab is run for the government by the University of
California.
   One passage from the McCallum report said security systems at a
Livermore building in which weapons-grade plutonium is handled ``do
not provide assurance'' that the highly radioactive material is
``adequately protected from theft or sabotage.''
   Also, it said the security system was unreliable in detecting
contraband at entry gates and intruders at specially protected
areas with access to nuclear materials.
   Under questioning from Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., McCallum
said these security lapses involved ``category one'' quantities of
plutonium, or amounts greater than 4{ pounds, which is enough to
build a nuclear bomb.
   McCallum's report was based on an inspection last April and May
of Livermore and the department's regional office in San Francisco
which oversees the lab's operations.
   Another published portion of McCallum's report said the lab
sometimes allowed ``category one'' quantities of plutonium to be
left unattended in rooms without security alarms. McCallum told
Sikorski this was a serious breach of security.
   Among other disclosures in the subcommittee report:
   _Among all the 26 weapons facilities and regional offices
inspected for security and weapons materials protection safeguards
by McCallum's office over the past year, Livermore ranked the
lowest.
   _The Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Las Vegas, Nev., regional offices
used private contractors in some cases to screen and interview
weapons plant employees seeking security clearances. These
contractors did not actually grant any clearances, but their role
nonetheless was contrary to department policy, officials said.
   _The department acknowledged that it lacks the resources to
complete investigations of suspected security violations by some
weapons employees who currently have access to classified material.
This violates the department's own policy, McCallum wrote in his
report, ``and does not provide assurance that only eligible
individuals are granted continued access to security interests.''
   The hearing also disclosed that the San Francisco regional
office had chosen not to include the plutonium-handling building in
its own most recent inspections of Livermore. Donald W. Pearman
Jr., acting manager of the San Francisco office, told the panel
that because of this omission, he was not aware of the plutonium
safeguards problems at the time of the McCallum inspection.
   In a later written response to Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
called the omission ``a serious oversight.'' Watkins also said the
San Francisco office had changed its inspection methods to include
``an intensive annual survey'' of all lab facilities.
   In the subcommittee report released Sunday, Dingell said annual
reports to the president from the energy secretary had offered ``a
misleading account'' of the level of protection being afforded
special nuclear materials and nuclear facilities.
   ``The most recent reports to the president are more on the order
of what one would expect from your local Chamber of Commerce,''
Dingell said. He added later the subcommittee was told that a
senior weapons security official at Washington headquarters, Edward
V. Badolato, told those preparing an annual report to the president
that it should be ``general in nature and contain pictures.''

   President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev remained at odds Sunday over the issue of arms
shipments to Marxist rebels in El Salvador.
   But they agreed democratic elections are the best hope for
long-term stability in Central America. And Bush said the weekend
summit helped narrow U.S.-Soviet differences over conflicts in the
region.
   Bush, at a joint news conference with Gorbachev after their
two-day shipboard summit, said he restated U.S. concerns that
Nicaragua and Cuba are shipping Soviet-made arms to leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador.
   Gorbachev reiterated that the Soviets are not involved. And, he
said he had been assured by the Sandinista government in Nicaragua
that it was not shipping arms to the Salvadoran rebels.
   ``We have a difference,'' Bush said. ``I don't believe that the
Sandinistas have told the truth to our Soviet friends. And why?
Because we know for a fact certain that arms have gone in there.''
   As evidence of a continuation of such shipments, the United
States has cited surface-to-air weapons and other arms recently
found in the wreckage of a plane that crashed in El Salvador.
   The Bush administration says the weapons were destined for
Salvadoran guerrillas fighting the U.S.-backed government.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, appearing on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation,'' said, ``It's not a case of our thinking that
the Soviet Union is sending weapons to Nicaragua, because they've
told us they're not, and we believe them.''
   But, he added, ``We do believe the Soviets when they say they're
trying to convince their clients (Cuba and Nicaragua) not to do
this, to go for a political solution in El Salvador. We think
they're trying.... We would like to encourage them to try a little
harder...''
   In their joint appearance, Bush and Gorbachev agreed that a free
and fair election in Nicaragua is the key to resolving tensions in
the region.
   ``We're in favor of free elections,'' Gorbachev said. ``We want
to see this conflict ended by political means, and we want to see a
normalization of the situation there.''
   ``That's what we agreed on,'' Bush interjected.
   The Nicaraguan government has pledged free elections next year,
but the Bush administration is skeptical about whether the
Sandinista government led by President Daniel Ortego will really
allow a free and fair vote that could knock it out of power.
   Later, speaking to a small group of U.S. reporters, Bush said
that Soviet ``assistance to Cuba and their lip service for the
Sandinistas give us a considerable amount of difference with them.''
   He added that ``until we see a free Cuba, self-determination and
the people deciding what they want, Cuba will stick out ... as a
small country swimming against Gorbachev's own tide.''

<HEAD>800 Protesters Arrested Outside Union Carbide Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police arrested about 800 people Sunday
when they tried to hold a protest inside the vacant Union Carbide
plant on the five-year anniversary of a gas leak that killed more
than 3,500 people.
   Before marching toward the plant, the protesters burned two
10-foot effigies symbolizing the U.S-based multinational company to
mark the anniversary of the world's worst industrial accident.
   ``Down with Union Carbide!'' the crowd shouted as hundreds of
riot police stood behind steel barricades erected in front of the
main gate of the pesticide plant, which was closed after the gas
leak on Dec. 3, 1984.
   V.C. David, a senior police officer, said about 600 men and 200
women were arrested and taken in buses to a city sports stadium
that was turned into a temporary jail. David said the people would
not be held long.
   Such detentions are legal under Indian law and are commonly used
to break up protests.
   David said some protesters hurled stones at the buses before
they got in.
   ``We just wanted to show our protest and anger against the
government and the company,'' said Balkrishna Gupta, the city
secretary of the Communist Party of India, which organized the
rally.
   He said all the demonstrators lived in shantytowns around the
plant and were directly in the path of the deadly methyl isocynate
gas that leaked from it. At least 3,598 people have died from
effects of the gas.
   Effigies made of bamboo, straw and rags were set on fire by a
60-year-old woman, Birju Bai, whose husband and four children were
killed by the gas.
   On Saturday night, several groups of victims burned effigies of
Union Carbide and its former chairman, Warren Anderson, in about a
dozen neighborhoods. Others prayed in churches, mosques and temples
for the victims.
   Gupta demanded the government distribute the $470 milion that
Union Carbide gave to the Indian government in April in final
compensation for the accident.
   But the government's right to agree to the Supreme
Court-supervised settlement has been challenged in the same court,
delaying disbursement of most of the money.
   The Indian government has spent millions of rupees on relief and
rehabilitation, but survivors say the measures are inadequate. The
government had originally sued Union Carbide for $3 billion,
alleging negligence. Union Carbide said the leak was the result of
sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   Relief workers say gas victims continue to die at a rate of at
least one a day. About 20,000 survivors still suffer from exposure
to the gas. Most victims suffer from eye and lung ailments and are
unable to work.
   On Sunday morning, the government organized prayer services for
the victims. The Madhya Pradesh state chief minister Motil Lal
Vohra said in a message: ``The gas victims are still struggling for
life, sustaining their endurance, fortitude, indomitable courage
and firm determination.''

<TEXT>
   The murder of a powerful banker killed
by a bomb on his way to work has unleashed accusations that police
overlooked clear signs terrorists were about to strike.
   Police have identified one of the probable suspects, a fugitive
member of the notorious Red Army Faction leftist terrorist gang,
but have made no arrests.
   Thursday's killing of Alfred Herrhausen, head of the Deutsche
Bank, stunned West Germany, which for weeks has been preoccupied
with events in neighboring East Germany.
   Authorities say Herrhausen's murder resembles at least four
previous Red Army Faction attacks. But there are increasing
allegations that security officials failed to notice indications
that Herrhausen was targeted.
   One newspaper on Saturday asked how terrorists could set up a
sophisticated bomb-trigger mechanism on Herrhausen's route without
being noticed by a special unit assigned to watch out for
suspicious activities.
   Discovery more than a month ago of a wire that apparently was
intended for use with the bomb also posed some uncomfortable
questions about security precautions.
   Besides the two security cars that normally escorted
Herrhausen's Mercedes, a special Hesse state police unit had been
recently assigned daily to observe his route to work in Frankfurt,
the Cologne Rundschau newspaper said.
   ``Police officials overlooked clear signs of the attack,'' the
newspaper charged.
   Willi Fundermann, spokesman for the federal police, told the
newspaper that officials were examining whether ``there were lapses
in the observation deployment.''
   Herrhausen, 59, was killed near his home in Bad Homburg as his
car passed by a light-beam device, triggering the powerful bomb
that destroyed his Mercedes. The bomb was strapped to a bicycle on
the side of the road.
   Authorities say they believe preparations for the attack began
at least four weeks earlier.
   These preparations included included chiseling out a long gap in
a sidewalk, laying wires in the crack, covering them up with
asphalt and recoloring the spot to make it appear it had not been
touched, they said.
   Federal officials said that late last month, a person noticed a
wire had been placed across the sidewalk. ``Without knowing its
significance, the wire was removed'' by the person, chief Federal
Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said on Friday.
   Police have found the bombers' getaway car. They also discovered
that the car's forged license plates bear identical characteristics
to plates recovered from cars used by leftist terrorists in at
least four previous attacks.
   Erwin Huber, of the arch-conservative Christian Social Union,
sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats,
charged there has been ``neglect in the search for terrorists.''
   The Bonn-based newspaper Die Welt reported that police in other
states were not immediately made aware of essentials of the attack,
speculating that could have hindered any attempts to catch the
bombers.
   Authorities have tentatively identified one of the two suspected
bombers as Christoph Seidler, 31, one of the country's most-wanted
leftist terrorists. He has been involved with the Red Army Faction
for at least a decade, they said.
   The Red Army Faction has a long history of attacks on West
German business and political figures as well as U.S. military
targets. The group had been relatively inactive in the past three
years.

   Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said Sunday he agreed with President Bush that the
superpowers should do ``our very best'' to help bring peace to
Lebanon.
   ``There's a real chance of taking a decisive step to open a
process of a settlement,'' Gorbachev told a news conference after
two days of talks with Bush. ``And what it's important to do is not
to miss the opportunity to do that, because the situation changes
very swiftly.''
   Bush said: ``We have found that the Soviet Union is playing a
constructive role in the Lebanon and trying throughout the Middle
East'' to support a settlement.
   He apparently was referring to Moscow's influence with Syria,
which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon that have fought with Moslem
militia forces against the mostly Christian army of Gen. Michel
Aoun.
   ``We do not want to see any more killing in Lebanon,'' Bush
said, adding that Gorbachev ``agrees with us'' and has ``very
actively'' supported an Arab League-mediated plan that calls for
political reforms to increase the role of the Moslem majority in
Lebanon.
   ``Lebanon was discussed in detail (at the summit), and we would
like to see a return to a peaceful, democratic Lebanon,'' Bush
said. ``We are trying any way we can to help.''
   Gorbachev didn't go into detail about what can be done to find a
Lebanon settlement, but he said both superpowers could contribute.
   ``President Bush thought that we had more possibilities, and I
thought that we had equal possibilities in order to resolve
positively this conflict,'' he said.
   ``It seems to me we do have an understanding between us that we
must do our very best, independently and together, to promote a
solution to this problem,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said he and Bush agreed that the peace plan had opened an
opportunity for a settlement.
   ``We think that we will make our contribution to that,''
Gorbachev said.
   ``There's common ground'' between the superpowers on the Middle
East, Bush said. ``That may not always have been the case in
history. And that may not always have been the way the United
States looked at it as to how constructive the role the Soviets
might play.''

<TEXT>
   After all was said and done, the
summit at sea was conducted beside a pier. Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev never put to sea and President Bush had trouble
reaching shore.
   ``I don't think anyone can say that the saltwater get-together
was anything other than adventure, at least out in the harbor
here,'' Bush said at the close of the summit.
   Bush and Gorbachev conducted all their business on the Soviet
liner Maxim Gorky docked at Marsaxlokk Bay instead of the
gale-buffeted Soviet missile cruiser Slava and USS Belknap, two
warships anchored not far from harbor.
   ``I want to thank the captain and crew of Belknap for the great
support that they've given us _ I think they were wondering if I
was about to become a permanent guest,'' said Bush, who was
stranded aboard the ship Saturday night by the storm.
   Switching sites for the shipboard summit raised questions about
whether it was a good idea in the first place.
   ``No, it was a very good idea,'' insisted Bush, when a reporter
asked the question as the president arrived onboard the luxury
liner.
   But, one reporter asked, didn't he think it was just as well
that the Soviets happened to have a big cruise boat handy at the
dock?
   ``We could have floated the Holiday Inn out here,'' Bush
replied, referring to the hotel prepared by White House staff as a
back-up meeting venue.
   ``This shows we can adjust to changing circumstances very
well,'' Gorbachev interjected.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Sunday's meetings
could have taken place onboard the USS Belknap as planned, but
Gorbachev didn't want to come out to the ship, about 500 yards
offshore.
   ``He doesn't share our love for the sea,'' Fitzwater said.

   Bush watched the building gale from the Belknap's rolling
bridge, sallied out into the bay's heaving waters on a small
admiral's barge and wore a tiny precaution for seasickness Sunday
during the dockside summit.
   Pool reporters aboard the Maxim Gorky reported that Bush, a
former naval officer, wore a medicated patch used to prevent motion
sickness after spending what crewmen aboard the Belknap described
as a rough night.
   Belknap crewmen said the ship was swinging on its forward anchor
throughout the second straight night of the fierce December gale.
But Bush apparently suffered no ill effects from the motion.
   ``He was fine. But I think some of his Secret Service guys were
a little green,'' said one officer.
   Both Bush and Secretary of State James Baker, who told reporters
no one was seasick, were seen Sunday morning using scopalamine, a
penny-size patch worn behind the ear that releases medication to
stabilize the liquid in the labyrinth of the inner ear, which
controls balance.
   The patch, which lasts 72 hours, is a used as a precaution
against seasickness and not as a treatment.
   White House strategist Sig Rogich told reporters earlier that
Bush enjoys rough weather. But other travelers from Washington
indicated they had a hard time of it.
   ``We're not used to this in Kansas,'' said Fitzwater, a native
of that midwestern state.

    _At the close of the summit, the leaders of the United States
and the Soviet Union held an unprecedented joint news conference in
an atmosphere so free of superpower tension that it would have
seemed impossible to believe just a few years ago.
   Gorbachev got the biggest laugh with a small, well-aimed barb at
Bush's much-publicized intention to approach the summit carefully.
   ``In our position the most dangerous thing is to exaggerate. We
always should preserve elements of cautiousness,'' said Gorbachev,
pausing before he added, ``I have used the favorite word of
President Bush.''
   At another point, while the two leaders were discussing their
positions on the possible reunification of Germany, Gorbachev said
that he and Bush had exchanged messages on the question.
   ``The president wrote in English and I don't read English. I
answered him in Russian and he doesn't read Russian. But, we
agreed,'' said Gorbachev.
   ``No matter what it said,'' added Bush.
   Near the end of their news conference, Gorbachev suggested
thanking reporters for their cooperation, but he added, ``although
of course we don't know what they've written yet or what they will
be writing.''
   But Bush, again showing caution, asked: ``Reserve the right to
thank them afterwards you mean, after we've seen what they've
written?''
   Replied Gorbachev: ``No, right now, and they will write
better.''

   _Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami forecast no problems for
Malta because of the stormy weather that drove the shipboard summit
to the side of the dock.
   ``For Malta itself, the summit has been very positive. It has
shown Malta can cope even with the necessary organization for a
summit like this. Some people were skeptical that Malta could do
it. I think we proved ourselves,'' he said in a post-summit
interview.
   ``As for the weather, well, I don't mind the weather at all. If
anything it has proved I was correct when I suggested that the
meetings should not be held in Marsaxlokk but in some other bay,
such as Grand Harbor which is much more protected than Marsaxlokk
Bay,'' he said.
   Richard Cachia Caruana, an aide to the prime minister who was in
charge of the Maltese organization for the summit, acknowledged the
television images of giant waves crashing against the rocks below
the 16th Century fortifications at Valletta probably would hurt the
island's tourism objectives.
   But he said the country's primary public relations objective,
especially in the United States, was to improve Malta's name
identification.
   ``Just being at the center of the world stage for two days in a
way helped give us that anyway,'' he said.
   ``Rather than riding tourism, we are pushing business
opportunity. That is where name identification is essential,'' he
said. ``If you can cope with a summit, it suggests your
infastructure is not that weak.''

   The shooting started before dawn after a police
officer tripped, accidentally firing his weapon. When it was over,
20 years ago Monday, two Black Panther leaders were dead and a new
black movement was born.
   The chaotic police raid marked the beginning of the end for the
radical black-liberation group, whose national membership numbered
about 4,000 then. But the assault also helped usher in a new era of
black political strength in Chicago, several community leaders said.
   Illinois Panther leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, both in
their early 20s, were gunned down in the raid Dec. 4, 1969, by 14
police officers who had been looking for weapons and claimed that
they had begun firing in self-defense after they were fired upon.
   After the officer tripped and set off his firearm, police fired
98 rounds into Hampton's apartment in 15 minutes. In addition to
the two who were killed, four other Panthers were wounded. Two
policemen also were injured.
   One shot was fired from inside, it was later determined, but it
did not strike anyone.
   Community leaders say the raid and the outrage it engendered
helped unify black voters.
   ``We all knew'' Cook County State's Attorney Edward Hanrahan had
ordered the raid, said Nancy Jefferson, who heads the Midwest
Community Center serving the city's West Side.
   When Hanrahan, a Democrat, sought re-election, black voters
helped Republican opponent Bernard Carey defeat him.
   That began independent politics for Chicago blacks, Ms.
Jefferson said.
   ``The community had been splintered or totally in the camp of
the Democratic Party,'' said real estate agent Dempsey Travis, who
has written books on black community life in Chicago, where the
population is about 40 percent black. ``With the murder of Hampton
and Clark, blacks did a 180-degree turn.''
   Ms. Jefferson says the black support that ensured the late
Harold Washington's 1983 election as the city's first black mayor
was a direct result of changes sparked by the raid.
   Today, violence still stalks the Panthers. In August, Huey
Newton _ a former leader whose story includes a doctorate in
philosophy and a manslaughter charge _ was gunned down in Oakland,
Calif., where the movement began. Police believe a man killed
Newton to win favor with a drug-dealing street gang.
   Few reminders are left of the angry, determined young blacks who
burst on the scene in the late 1960s, in the shadow of the
non-violent civil-rights movement. Hampton's apartment building is
an abandoned hulk.
   But 20 years ago, the Panther's rhetoric and radical politics
were fiery, uncompromising and scary.
   The Panthers were widely viewed as criminals, with their
defiantly displayed firearms _ touted as defenses against police
oppression _ and rallying cries of ``Off the pigs!'' and ``Power to
the people!''
   FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called them ``the most dangerous
and violence-prone of all extremist groups.'' But the image always
has been disputed.
   ``They were a self-defense group. But the media portrayed them
as if they were a gang,'' says William Hampton, Fred Hampton's
brother.
   In Chicago, they challenged a corrupt political machine. Mayor
Richard J. Daley was undisputed boss of the city. On the largely
black West Side, white ward committeemen answered to the mayor.
   ``There was a slave mentality in blacks when it came to
politics,'' Ms. Jefferson recalled, and the Panthers ``attempted to
address the political climate at the time.''
   The Panthers launched community programs, providing breakfasts
for hungry children, blood drives and a ``liberation school.''
   But the weapons and rhetoric made the headlines and drew police
attention.
   On Dec. 3, 1969, Illinois Panther leaders met at Hampton's
apartment to discuss political and other concerns, said Alderman
Bobby Rush, a former Panther defense minister.
   ``All of us were going to spend the night ... but it was too
crowded and some of us decided to break up and go home,'' Rush
recalled.
   The shooting started before the sun came up.
   There were several investigations, including one by former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark. No one was convicted of any crime,
though the families of the dead and wounded Panthers shared a
modest settlement from the city 14 years later.

   Soviets learned from state-run media Sunday of the
arrest of former East German leaders and resignation of that
country's Communist leadership, and of Czechoslovakia's stand on
the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.
   The Tass news agency and the Sunday evening TV news program
``Seven Days'' told of the latest changes sweeping Eastern Europe
in reports that were dominated by the summit of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and President Bush.
   Tass reported Sunday's expulsion of Erich Honecker and others
from the East German Communist Party and the resignation of the
entire party Central Committee and Politburo. Honecker was ousted
as party leader on Oct. 18.
   Tass said some former East German officials were accused of
``doing great damage to national property and the country's economy
through abuse of power.''
   In a report from Prague, Czechoslovakia, where a new government
was named Sunday, Tass noted that several new officials were under
50 years old, much younger than the former Communist leadership.
   The news agency also told its readers that the Czechoslovak
government had called the invasion by Warsaw Pact forces in 1968 to
crush the ``Prague Spring'' reforms ``a violation of the norms of
relations between sovereign governments.''
   Gorbachev said Friday that the Czechoslovak reform movement of a
generation ago was ``important and right at the time and is right
now.'' But he stopped short of apologizing for the invasion.

   A fire engulfed a shooting club Sunday
and sparked several gunpowder explosions, killing a dozen people
and injuring eight others as they tried to flee, authorities said.
   Most of the victims were badly burned when they were unable to
escape from the 109 Club, said Steven Onzea of the emergency
coordination center. Three were taken to a military hospital for
treatment of severe burns.
   The accident happened when some of the 40 people at the club in
a Brussels suburb were at the range for shooting practice.
   ``We were target shooting and all of a sudden a fire started at
our side,'' an unidentified survivor told BRT state television.
Munitions exploded as people tried to flee.
   The cause of the midday blast has not been determined, although
police spokesman Christian Capelle said a spark might have touched
off gunpowder residue in the air and on the floor.

<DATELINE>MARSAXLOKK BAY, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from an informal
question-and-answer session that President Bush held Sunday with
reporters after his joint press conference with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the conclusion of their two-day summit.
   Q. This goal ... you set for yourself, at least toward moving
towards an end to the Cold War _ he (Gorbachev) said an epoch has
ended. How do you feel about that?
   A. I think this is a major step towards understanding and
towards any _ in trying to tear down any remaining barriers that
shot up because of the Cold War. There's no question that the
conditions today are far different than at the depths of the Cold
War. No question about it. I haven't even heard anybody argue to
the contrary.
   Q. Mr. President, what do you think of NATO and Warsaw Pact
evolving to political organizations and really moving out of a
military mode?
   A. Well, if we make the progress that I hope we'll make on
various arms control items and if tensions continue to go down, as
they have, inside the Soviet Union and in terms of relations with
the United States and Eastern Europe, who knows where the change
will take us. But obviously, I have a certain responsibility for
keeping NATO strong, and nothing here has altered that desire. But
as you see the historical changes taking place, I think it's fine
to envision a group of countries that spend a lot more time
worrying about the economic side and less on the defense side. We
are not there yet. We are not there. ...
   Q. What will you tell the NATO leaders?
   A. Well, I'll wait until I get there to decide that. I'll give
them a pretty good report on what went on in considerable detail _
not all necessarily, because some relates to the US-Soviet
equation. But we'll have a good, frank discussion, and I think they
will be pleased at what the results of the meeting are.
   Q. Mr. President, other than the weather, were there any
disappointments? You seem to still be at odds, very much so, on
Central America. And was there anything Mr. Gorbachev told you that
especially surprised or pleased you?
   A. No, no surprises. And, I _ but as I say ... we cannot in, you
know, 10 hours of discussion or whatever it is, solve all the
problems that exist between the United States and the Soviet Union,
and the way we look at different areas. But, it's _ it would be
euphorically optimistic to think that a meeting like this would
solve all those problems. But it's better, we understand more. I've
got some areas where I can now go back to him, various areas. But
there were no surprises. It was a wide discussion _ I'm not sure we
left out any subjects in a geopolitical sense, but we covered a lot
of them. ...
   Q. Disappointments -- no specific disappointments? Something you
wish he was more forthcoming on?
   A. No particular disappointments, no. ... Because I think the _
I think the goal now is to go forward, as we have wanted to anyway,
and demonstrate everybody's commitment to CFE talks; everybody's
commitment to chemical weapons reductions, eventual elimination;
and of course, the START agenda. ...
   Q. Now, now having a better understanding of Mr. Gorbachev after
this meeting, could you tell us what you know about him today, or
understand about him today?
   A. Well, I know that he's perfectly willing to have very frank
discussions, even if I'm on the opposite side of a question from
him. There was no anger, there was no vitriol. It was a very
constructive set of meetings in that regard. And so, I saw a man
who is confident. I saw a man who was calm in our _ in his
presentations, and responded as factually as he could in some of
the questions I raised. And so, I am convinced that the concept of
getting together for a ``no agenda meeting'' was very, very sound.
   Q. Do you think that the United States and the Soviet Union now
are dealing with each other more as allies than adversaries?
   A. I wouldn't say allies, but with far less misunderstanding,
and with far more common goals.
   Q. What do you think of the adversarial relationship, of the
nature of the relationship now?
   A. Well, I say _ as I say I think it's vastly improved, tensions
reduced _ not eliminated but reduced. We still have different ways
of looking at certain questions, and _ but I think the answer is
improved.
   Q. Mr. President, relatives of Pan Am (Flight) 103 bombing were
going to have a ceremony in the harbor today, drop flowers into the
harbor as part of their attempt to have both you and Mr. Gorbachev
work together in fighting international terrorism. Did this come up
specifically this weekend? Did you talk a little bit about it?
   A. Not 103 per se, but you're talking about anti-international
terror. Yes, it did, and also in the anti-narcotics efforts. So
there's more we can do. We didn't discuss it specifically, but I'm
thinking about certain kinds of intelligence interchange that can
prove to be beneficial. ...
   Q. Secretary Baker, before he came out here a couple weeks ago,
said that the Soviet role in Cuba and Central America was the
primary obstacle to a more beneficial full-scale relationship
between the two countries. You agree -- now you disagreed here, but
did you advance the issue at all?

   President Sheik Zayed bin
Sultan Al Nahyan on Sunday denounced the United States as the
``Arabs' No. 2 enemy,'' saying it supports Israel at the expense of
the Palestinians.
   ``Israel is our No. 1 enemy, and America is our No. 2 enemy,''
he told a news conference at the culmination of nationwide
celebrations marking the 18th anniversary of the United Arab
Emirates.
   ``America supports Israel in its intransigence against the
rightful cause of the Palestinians,'' Sheik Zayed said.
   The United States stands to lose the friendship of 21 Arab
powers by ``exaggerating its support for Israel,'' he said.
   Otherwise, he said, the United Arab Emirates ``has warm and
friendly relations with America.''
   Answering a wide range of questions by Arab and foreign
reporters, the sheik lauded Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
for introducing ``appreciable changes'' for his people.
   But he cautioned the Arabs against hinging any hopes on the
U.S.-Soviet summit talks, contending that ``the two superpowers
care more about their own interests and less about everything
else.''
   The 71-year-old president rejected the concept of Arab unity as
a ``meaningless hallucination.'' He stressed that ideas of
``integration or cooperation are far more meaningful.''
   ``I have been hearing the term unity for 40 years now but have
seen nothing real, nothing tangible, of it,'' he said. ``We have
opted for cooperation, as opposed to unity in the common sense of
the term in our parlance.''
   He was referring to the creation of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, a six-nation economic integration and collective defense
pact grouping Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates.
   The United Arab Emirates was created in 1971 by merging the
seven sheikdoms of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Umm al-Quwain,
Fujairah, Ajman and Ras al-Khaimah.

   Two Israeli-backed militiamen died Sunday in a
roadside bomb explosion in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone
in south Lebanon, military officials said.
   The blast occurred at about 11 a.m. near Bayt Yahun village, six
miles north of the Israeli border, Israel radio said.
   It said the South Lebanon Army militia shelled targets outside
the security zone in response to the attack.
   It was the second deadly assault on the South Lebanon Army in
two days. On Saturday, a militiaman died in a roadside bomb
explosion near the Lebanese village of Ayshieh.
   Militia gunners responded by shelling the nearby town of
Nabatiyeh, killing three Shiite Moslems and wounding nine, Lebanese
police reported.
   The 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army, backed by Israeli soldiers,
patrols the security zone, a narrow buffer strip along the border.
The militia is trained and financed by Israel.
   Israel carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of
its troops from southern Lebanon in June 1985, ending a three-year
occupation of the region. The zone is intended to protect Israel
from cross-border raids.

<TEXT>
   It's a feud fit for the Old West.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., thought it would be a good idea to
celebrate the 100th birthdays of six Northwest states with a
commemorative coin.
   Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington turned 100
years old this year, and Idaho and Wyoming will hit the century
mark in 1990.
   But Baucus' insistence that some of the coins be made of
palladium, a metal mined only in his home state, led to a standoff
with the House and the U.S. Mint that has all but doomed his plan.
   The Mint opposed minting any coins for the six states, arguing
at a House hearing in October that there already were too many
commemorative issues. The Mint particularly opposed using
palladium, contending the silver-white metal used in automobile
catalytic converters is too hard to mint.
   Representatives of coin collectors agreed with the Mint, and the
House last week approved a silver-only issue of a million coins.
   But the Senate, which has approved Baucus' palladium plan at
least four times, accepted Baucus' demand that at least 175,000
coins be made of palladium. Earlier he had proposed 350,000.
   The Senate passed Baucus' plan Nov. 22 shortly before Congress
adjourned this year's session. The House, however, refused to back
down and sent the bill back to the Banking Committee that rejected
Baucus' idea in the first place. It is not expected to be the
committee's top priority.
   ``It may be a dead issue, frankly,'' Baucus spokesman Bob
Harrison said.
   Interest in the bill has been focused in the delegations of
Idaho and Montana, the two states with the most to gain.
   South Dakota, for example, has been more concerned with getting
a coin approved for the 50th anniversary of Mount Rushmore National
Memorial.
   Baucus accuses silver-producing states like Idaho, which
produces a quarter of the nation's supply, of sabotaging his idea.
   ``It was an issue of equity,'' Harrison said. ``It was Max's
bill, and we were being disinvited to participate in it.''

<HEAD>Sinking Tanker Threatens to Cause Israel's Worst Oil Spill</HEAD>

   An oil tanker was sinking Sunday in the
Mediterranean, and heavy seas threatened to smash it onto rocks and
cause the worst oil spill in Israel's history, officials said.
   About 30 to 60 tons of fuel and oil already have leaked, they
said. The oil covered the beaches along this resort town north of
Tel Aviv.
   ``It looks like a ... street paved on the beach,'' said
Environment Ministry director Uri Marinov. ``But it is zero
compared to what will happen if all 600 tons come out.''
   The Israeli-owned Eyal, carrying 660 tons of heavy oil,
developed engine problems Thursday en route from the northern port
of Haifa to the port of Ashdod in the south.
   Government officials said the 150-foot ship, Israel's only
coastal tanker, flooded in high seas.
   Eyal's six-member crew was evacuated Thursday after issuing a
number of distress calls during the day.
   On Sunday, only a part of the ship's bow was visible above the
water. The ship was about 600 yards from shore.
   ``If the ship remains as it is, there is a danger it would be
broken,'' said Elik Adler, head of the Environment Ministry's
Marine Pollution Prevention Department.
   Adler said divers Sunday worked to seal all openings on the ship.
   Tractors and heavy equipment were brought in to clean fuel from
beaches.
   Herzliya Mayor Eli Landau was quoted as saying by the daily
Jerusalem Post that the beachfront has been ruined and that it will
cost millions of dollars to clean up.

   President Bush and Soviet Leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev wrapped up two days of superpower summitry on
Sunday, claiming strides toward a new era of East-West peace but
underscoring differences that linger at the end of a 45-year Cold
War.
   Both men said they would meet again next year in the United
States, and expressed the hope _ but not the certainty _ they would
be able to sign historic agreements in 1990 to cut long range
nuclear weapons and conventional forces in Europe and make progress
toward a chemical weapons ban.
   ``We stated, both of us, that the world leaves one epoch of Cold
War and enters another epoch,'' Gorbachev said at an unprecedented
joint news conference that marked the end of two days of
storm-tossed talks held aboard a Soviet luxury liner. ``We are just
at the very beginning of our long road to a long-lasting peaceful
period.''
   Said Bush after his first summit as president: ``I am optimistic
that as the West works patiently together and increasingly
cooperates with the Soviet Union, we can realize a lasting peace
and transform the East-West relationship into one of enduring
cooperation.''
   Even so, neither man sought to gloss over differences on two
topics, the Soviets' call for cuts in naval forces and American
anger at the continued flow of Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in
El Salvador.
   Gorbachev departed Malta for Moscow, where he was convening a
meeting of virtually an entirely new lineup of Warsaw Pact leaders
to discuss the summit.
   Bush went immediately to Belgium to meet with NATO leaders on
Monday. Arriving in Brussels, he noted the ``thunderous events''
taking place in the Eastern bloc, and said, ``Tonight we stand at
the crossroads of history on a way to Europe, whole and free...And
that simple truth brought Mikhail Gorbachev and me together in a
windswept harbor off Malta.''
   Windswept it was. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker, who
spent the night aboard ship in the harbor, sported penny-size
patches behind their ears to guard against seasickness.
   The joint news conference in Malta was held aboard the Soviet
luxury liner Maxim Gorky, which was pressed into service as the
site for the two days of talks after bad weather forced
cancellation of plans to use U.S. and Soviet warships anchored
offshore. An afternoon session and a dinner on Saturday were
cancelled because of the rough weather.
   The two superpower leaders met for eight hours over two days at
a time of extraordinary change in Eastern Europe. The upheaval was
dramatized in the summit's final hours by the resignation of the
East German leadership and the formation of a new government in
Czechoslovakia that opposition leaders immediately denounced as too
much like the old one.
   Gorbachev said he was ``encouraged and inspired'' by the changes
in Eastern Europe.
   Bush said Gorbachev's acceptance of the changes there ``lays to
rest previous doctrines,'' under which the Soviet Union had
asserted a right to intervene militarily in Eastern Europe.
   Still, Gorbachev at one point said that he opposed
``artificially'' speeding up the process, a reference to proposals
for the reunification of Germany _ a plan strongly opposed by the
Soviet Union.
   ``There were no surprises,'' Bush told reporters shortly before
leaving this Mediterranean island nation. He said he thought the
session had helped him and the Soviet leader better size each other
up as individuals.
   Asked about Gorbachev's desire for naval arms reductions, Bush
said he was ``disinclined to think that is an area where we will
make immediate progress'' and that ``We still have differences with
the Soviet Union. He knows it and I know it, as it relates to naval
forces.''
   On the issue of Central America, where the United States has
complained about the continued flow of Soviet-bloc arms to Marxist
rebels in El Salvador, Bush said the United States will stand by
its assertion that these weapons are still reaching the rebels _
most likely being supplied by Moscow's allies in the region, Cuba
and Nicaragua.
   ``I will not be satisfied until total self-determination takes
places through verifiably free elections in Nicaragua,'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev said the Soviets also supported free elections in
Nicaragua. But, he said, ``We have reaffirmed once again to the
president that we have ceased arms shipments to Central America.''

   Buoyed by a cordial summit
atmosphere, President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said they planned to rendezvous again in June and said their
foreign ministers would speed work on three arms-control treaties.
   ``If a meeting can improve relations, I think this one has,''
Bush told the news conference aboard the Soviet passenger ship
Maxim Gorky.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze are to meet next month in the
Soviet Union to accelerate work on the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START), a treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE),
and chemical weapons, Bush and Gorbachev said at an unprecedented
joint news conference.
   Another Baker-Shevardnadze meeting is scheduled at a
multinational conference in Ottawa next February, and a third was
possible before June, perhaps in Shevardnadze's native Georgia, in
the southern Soviet Union, said Soviet officials.
   The next summit, said Bush, ``will drive the arms control
agenda. And that's a good thing, because I represented to him that
we wanted to see a START agreement, a CFE agreement, and hopefully,
a chemical agreement. That's a very ambitious agenda.''
   The most important result of the Malta summit may not be the
accelerated timetable on arms deals, but the sense that the two
leaders were working together to improve U.S.-Soviet relations and
solve conflicts around the world.
   ``I could not have asked for a better result out of this
non-summit summit,'' said Bush.
   ``A better U.S.-Soviet relationship is to be valued in and of
itself, but it also should be an instrument of positive change in
the world,'' he said.
   Gorbachev, describing the news conference as the first ever
organized for U.S. and Soviet leaders to hold jointly, said, ``We
made good contact. The atmosphere was friendly, straightforward,
open, and this enabled us to make good work.''
   ``We stated, both of us, that the world leaves the one epoch of
Cold War and enters another epoch,'' he added. ``We are just at the
very beginning of our long road to a longlasting peaceful period.''
   Despite the visionary words, many hard issues remain if the two
sides are to complete the three proposed treaties.
   On START, which would cut long-range superpower nuclear arsenals
by 30 to 50 percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece, they disagree over
how to count air-launched cruise missiles, how to handle undeployed
missiles, and over U.S. allegations that the Soviets have encoded
data transmissions from ballistic missile tests in violation of
previous arms accords.
   Gorbachev was optimistic, however.
   ``As to strategic offensive arms, the analysis of the situation
and the instructions that have been given regarding the preparation
of that treaty demonstrate that we may be able by the second half
of June _ and we agreed on the formal meeting at that time to do
the necessary work _ to agree on the basic provisions of this
treaty, which then later in the coming months would be ready for a
signature,'' he said.
   ``In connection with the new interesting proposals by President
Bush regarding chemical weapons which have the goal of a global ban
and provides for certain phases and movement towards this global
ban, then we have the possibility of a rapid movement towards it,''
said Gorbachev.
   On Saturday, Bush change a chemical weapons proposal he made at
the United Nations last September, offering to stop production of a
new generation of U.S. chemicals in the first year of a proposed
40-nation convention to ban such substances. Previously, Bush had
planned to continue such production.
   In the conventional arms talks, which would remove 30,000 U.S.
and 325,000 Soviet troops from Central Europe, and control tanks
and other weapons, the two sides remain divided over how to count
warplanes.
   Gorbachev has proposed that such an agreement be signed by the
end of 1990 at a summit of the 35-nations of Europe and North
America.
   The leaders took the next steps toward a conventional arms deals
immediately their summit, as the American president flew to
Brussels to consult with his allies in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and Gorbachev headed to Moscow to brief leaders of the
Warsaw Pact.
   Bush said that if the Soviet legislature passes a liberalized
emigration law, as advocated by Gorbachev, he will recommend trade
favors designed to ease the pressure on the Soviet economy and
bolster Kremlin political reforms.
   ``There is enormous support in our country for what Chairman
Gorbachev is doing inside the Soviet Union. There is enormous
support for the way he has advocated peaceful change in Europe,''
said Bush.
   ``For example, the Soviet Union now seeks greater engagement in
the international market economy, a step that certainly I'm
prepared to encourage in any way I can,'' Bush said.
   Bush told Gorbachev that he would recommend Congress grant the
Soviet Union most-favored nation status, easing tariffs on Soviet
exports to America, and ending a sanction imposed 15 years ago to
encourage the Kremlin to ease Jewish emigration.
   The liberalized emigration law is expected to clear the Soviet
parliament in January or February, and the National Conference on
Soviet Jewery announced Sunday that Jewish emigration from the
Soviet Union reached an all-time high in November, 11,169,
suprassing the previous high of 9,450 set in October.
   The U.S. president also promised to work to obtain a longtime
Soviet goal of obtaining observer status in the General Agreement
on Trade and Tariffs, a decision that must be made by the 97-nation
group, but which the United States can influence heavily.

   Four intoxicated young men apparently
trying to be funny dug up a body from a cemetery and took it to the
home of a sleeping acquaintance, who woke up, failed to see the
humor and called police.
   ``We got drunk, went to the graveyard and dug up a body,'' one
of the four, Ronald Kramer, 18, of East Wenatchee, said in an
interview before he was taken to jail. ``It was like a prank, to
freak out some friends. But now that I'm sober, I can't believe I
did it.''
   The four were booked Friday night for investigation of opening a
grave, stealing a body, receiving a body and mutilating human
remains. Each is a felony carrying a maximum penalty of three years
in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   The remains removed from Hamilton Cemetery were those of a woman
who died sometime between 1910 and 1920, said Douglas County
sheriff's detective Rich Adams.
   The youths ``had been drinking and they decided it would be neat
to see what a body looked like after that length of time,'' Adams
said. ``One thing led to another and they decided ... to take the
body from the grave to a house in Wenatchee.''
   The body's head and finger bones allegedly were removed, ``for
what purpose we don't know,'' he said.

   Communist leader Egon Krenz and his entire
government resigned on Sunday, and a 25-member panel of reformers
took over temporary leadership in a desperate effort to rescue the
Communist Party.
   The historic action, announced by megaphone to a wildly cheering
crowd, stripped power from Krenz less than six weeks after he
replaced hard-liner Erich Honecker. Krenz was left off the new
panel, which will control East Germany's ruling party until a party
congress later this month.
   It was the shortest reign of any leader in the country's
history. However, Krenz retains the largely ceremonial position of
president.
   The Communists also expelled Honecker from the party he had led
for 18 years and announced that three ousted Politburo members had
been arrested on corruption charges. A top state trade official
fled the country.
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans linked hands across the
country to form a human chain intended to increase pressure for
quicker democratic reforms and to protest corruption in Communist
Party ranks.
   In neighboring Czechoslovakia, leaders included non-Communists
in the government for the first time in 21 years, but angered
opposition leaders said there were too many Communist holdovers on
the new Cabinet. They vowed to resume pro-democracy protests.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev praised the changes under
way in Eastern Europe as he ended his two-day summit with President
Bush.
   ``I think (it) is something we should welcome because it's
connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their
societies, to make them more democratic, humanitarian, to open up
the rest of the world,'' he said.
   Under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus of
thousands, Krenz took over on Oct. 18 and opened the Berlin Wall on
Nov. 9. He promised democratic reforms including free elections,
but there were increased calls for his ouster even within the party
because of his past links to Honecker's rule. He was jeered
Saturday by party members who demanded his resignation.
   The new committee will run party affairs until a special party
congress Dec. 15-17 and prepare for that congress. Its role in
governing the country was not immediately clear.
   Guenter Schabowski announced the resignations of the 10-man
Politburo and the 163-member, policy-making Central Committee by
megaphone to 10,000 cheering people who stood outside the Central
Committee building.
   ``The Politburo accepts the criticism raised by a large number
of party members that the current leadership is not capable of
uncovering the entire scope of serious mistakes of the members of
the former Politburo and to draw the necessary consequences,'' he
said.
   Schabowski, who was one of those who resigned from the
Politburo, was considered a reformer, but like all of the ousted
officials, he was not named to the new committee.
   Officials made it clear the Central Committee actions were meant
to convince the populace the party is truly intent on jettisoning
its tainted image and fulfilling demands for political and economic
reforms.
   ``We want to form a modern Socialist party guided by the rank
and file. We want to save this country. We want to save
socialism,'' said Gregor Gysi, a prominent East Berlin lawyer and
spokesman for the new 25-member committee.
   Gysi said the panel's first act was to set up a commission to
examine ``violations of the party's statutes and laws by former and
current functionaries of the party.''
   The new panel includes reformers such as former spymaster Markus
Wolf, Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer and the panel's chairman,
Erfurt party chief Herbert Kroker.
   Kroker said the leadership was forced to resign because ``of its
inability to develop a constructive policy for the renewal of
socialism.''
   Gysi said Premier Hans Modrow, also a reformer, declined an
offer to join the committee because his current work already takes
up most of his time.
   Schabowski also announced the ouster from the party of Honecker
and 11 other disgraced officials following disclosures of
corruption among top party ranks.
   Others thrown out of the party included former Premier Willi
Stoph, ex-security chief Erich Mielke and former Parliament speaker
Horst Sindermann.
   The 12 are suspected of ``serious violations of party
statutes,'' Schabowski said.
   The widening investigations of corruption led to the arrests of
three former Politburo members.
   Guenter Mittag and Harry Tisch, who had been key Politburo
members under Honecker, were arrested and accused of ``heavily
damaging socialist property and the people's economy through abuse
of power,'' the state-run news service ADN said.
   Gerhard Mueller, former party leader in the city of Erfurt and
former candidate, or non-voting, member of the Politburo, was
arrested under similar suspicions, ADN said.
   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a state secretary in the foreign
trade ministry, fled the country after authorities opened an
investigation into suspected corruption by him, ADN reported.
   Mittag was expelled from the party last month, while Tisch,
Mueller and Schalck-Golodkowski were kicked out Sunday.
   ADN said that 30 other criminal probes into allegations of
corruption had been opened, but it did not give any names.
   Schalck-Golodkowski was East Germany's chief trade negotiator
and headed the Commercial Coordination department, which has been
responsible for acquiring hard currency.
   The investigation was opened after Saturday's discovery of a
secret operation to ship weapons to the Middle East, Africa and
South America.
   Hard-currency earnings from the sales went to the country's
foreign trade bank addressed to Schalck-Golodkowski, ADN said,
without mentioning how much money was involved.

<HEAD>Oswego State Kicks Off `Bias Busters' Campaign to Combat Bigotry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in 6th graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bulletin board announcement of open season
on blacks and other racial incidents have led the a state college
here to start a ``bias busters'' campaign to combat campus bigotry.
   The campaign starting Sunday at the State University of New York
College at Oswego is an effort to confront what college leaders say
is a nationwide trend.
   ``Do I think this will help? Yes. Do I think this will solve the
problem? No. But we've got to do what we can,'' said Oswego State
President Stephen Weber.
   The first step in stopping bigotry and prejudice is to
acknowledge it exists, Weber said. Officials of the 7,600-student
college 35 miles north of Syracuse said the ``bias busters''
campaign is aimed at getting students to take a public stance when
they witness incidents of racism or bigotry.
   ``The whole point of what we're trying to do is to get to the
silent majority which by its silence condones these acts,'' Weber
said.
   Just before Thanksgiving, an announcement pinned to a bulletin
board in a campus dormitory said it was open season on ``porch
monkeys,'' and contained other racial slurs.
   ``If they're going to tell you that they're going to hunt you
down and kill you, that's scary,'' the Syracuse Herald American
quoted a senior from the Dominican Republic as saying. She said she
found the notice posted outside her dorm room.
   Black students are not the only targets. Two weeks ago, a gay
student was threatened and the tires on his car slashed. Another
student said he was considering moving out of his dorm because of
harassment he receives for being openly gay.
   ``Bias busters'' can wear a lapel pin bearing the word bias
surrounded by a circle with a slash through the center.
   In addition, bias reduction workshops will be offered throughout
the year, to help participants identify their own prejudices and
work on getting rid of them, said Catherine Martin, a workshop
coordinator.
   ``It's not a case where you're going to change the world, but if
you change, people around you will see that and react to it,'' she
said. ``If you make it known that you don't want to hear racist and
sexist jokes, then people won't tell them around you.''
   Some students felt that prejudice was too widespread and
entrenched to be much affected by slogans and buttons. Others feel
the campaign would raise public consciousness about the issue.
   ``I think most people don't think there's racial problems on
this campus, and that's not the truth,'' said Emilio Dorcely, vice
president of the campus student association. ``It's no better or no
worse than anyplace else, but it could be better _ and this
campaign is a positive approach to the problem.''
   Frank Pogue, the State University of New York's vice chancellor
for student affairs and special programs, said anti-bias programs
have been instituted and more are planned for SUNY's 64 campuses,
the nation's largest state university system.
   ``Our approach is to prevent rather than react,'' Pogue said.
``Any one occurrence of bias-related activity on a college campus
is too many.''

<HEAD>Ritz Hotel of France Battles Iowan over Toilet Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man named Ritzer would naturally be
nicknamed Ritz, and would be likely to give his nickname to
something he invented. So argues Tom Ritzer, who invented a potty
training toilet seat and called it the Rit-Z.
   But the people who guard the reputation of the famed Ritz Hotel
in Paris think Ritzer is trying to use their name without
permission.
   The hotel people asked the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to order Ritzer to stop using
their name.
   ``It's been one nightmare after another,'' said Ritzer, 48, of
Arnolds Park, in northwestern Iowa. ``I think what's really
happening here is that the big Ritz Hotel in France is trying to
put a hurtin' on the little Iowa toilet seat company.''
   But Ritz president Frank Klein, who flew to New York to testify
in the case in October, said Ritzer represents a genuine threat.
   ``The Ritz Hotel in Paris stands for privacy, for perfection,
for discretion,'' he testified. ``The Ritz had such a reputation
for over the last 80 years that whatever we do ... whatever is
matched with our name, has to be in a perfect way.''
   Thus, he said, Nabisco Foods paid the Ritz for use of its name
on Ritz crackers.
   Klein said Ritzer deliberately cloned his hotel's name for the
toilet seat.
   ``Why does the man put the name Ritz on it? Because he needs us
as a signature. That's what he has done, the man is not stupid.
What else could work better than the name Ritz?'' Klein testified.
   The trouble began two years ago when Ritzer applied for a patent
and trademark on his invention. The patent was granted but the Ritz
Hotel filed formal opposition to the name Rit-Z after one of its
attorneys noticed the request in a routine review of trademark
applications.
   Lawyers on both sides said they don't expect a decision for
several months.
   Ritzer said the name came naturally and has nothing to do with
the hotel.
   Ritz, he said, is ``the nickname everybody in the Ritzer family
has had for generations and I put it on the toilet seat because
it's short and easy to remember and because it's kind of an
attention-getter.''
   ``We never even gave a thought to the idea that someone might
confuse our name and toilet seat with the Ritz Hotel.''
   Ritzer gave his reply testimony last week in the office of his
Des Moines lawyer, Edmund Sease.
   Ritzer, who operated a plumbing business in Arnolds Park for 25
years, explained that his family had trouble toilet training a
daughter in the 1960s.
   She was afraid of the big toilet seat ``because she was afraid
she'd fall in or somebody would flush it while she was up there,''
he said. ``I got to thinking there just has to be a better way to
combine the ideas of toilet seats and toilets and potty chairs to
make it easier for the little kids.''
   So he made a toilet seat with an extra ring that could be pulled
down to accommodate infants' smaller bottoms. Other people wanted
one, so four years ago, he said, he sold the plumbing business to
his son and started the three-employee toilet seat business.
   The double-ring seat has been marketed to hardware stores and
children's furniture stores. The Ritzers say they have sold between
3,000 and 4,000 in the last 18 months.

   President Bush said Sunday the
superpower summit helped erase Mikhail S. Gorbachev's doubts about
the intentions of a new American president toward the Soviet Union
and its political and economic reforms.
   ``I don't think he has me down as a total negativist at all and
I certainly don't have him down'' that way, said Bush, who has
weathered criticism at home and in the Kremlin for his guarded
approach toward changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Bush said the two days of talks gave him and Gorbachev a chance
to get to know one another. He added that as a result of their
earlier meetings when he was vice president, the summit ``was
probably less formidable than if I'd never met him ever.''
   Bush was in high spirits as he spoke to half-a-dozen reporters
aboard the Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky shortly before departing
Malta.
   He said he wrote humorous notes to 25 friends Saturday night,
when bad weather forced cancellation of a dinner with the Soviets
and left him stranded on an American warship anchored in the harbor.
   ``And funny, you'll die,'' he said, describing the
correspondence. ``It's a whole new emotional, humorous side to this
president.''
   He said it was difficult to describe his personal feelings
``because I'm not the most articulate emotionalist.
   Turning his attention to Gorbachev, he said, ``He knows that I'm
cautious.
   ``You heard him use the word `prudent' (to describe Bush). I'm
sure that was deliberate,'' the president said.
   ``But I can't have asked for a better ambiance, a better feel
from the meetings, even though the differences are acute in some
areas.''
   Commenting on dynamics of his talks, Bush said, ``I'd like to
think he thought I knew what I was talking about, so we could have
a good exchange without having to go to the experts or go to the
notebooks, and it worked.''
   Bush originally had conceived their meeting as a relaxed,
feet-up, get acquainted session but the talks took on a new
dimension in the wake of the collapse of hard-line communist
regimes in Eastern Europe.
   Even so, Bush said, ``At one moment I actually did put my foot
up.''
   Bush said that in Gorbachev, ``I saw a man who was confident,
who was calm in his presentations.''
   Contrary to some expectations, Bush said there were no surprises
from Gorbachev in their meetings.
   Bush talked about the summit just minutes after holding a joint
news conference with Gorbachev and saying farewell to him on the
Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky where they held eight hours of talks
over two days.
   Talking with reporters in a small cabin on the ship, Bush called
the talks productive and constructive and said, ``it worked exactly
as I expected.''
   He said that six months ago, ``there was probably a
misunderstanding about the intentions of this new president, and I
think one of the good things is that I don't think he has any
feeling that I'm going to be unforthcoming in situations where I
should be.''
   Bush said the climate of the talks was radically different from
when he first met Gorbachev, shortly before the Soviet leader came
to power in 1985.
   ``I remember a time when I first met Mr. Gorbachev and we talked
about human rights and he became visibly agitated with me for
raising it,'' Bush said.
   ``I think there's been an evolution of his thinking ... and
certainly in his relations with the United States, just as there's
been an evolution in my thinking.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Gorbachev had
responded positively on Saturday when Bush spelled out a package of
proposals for dealing with the Soviet Union's attempts to overhaul
its ailing economy and the upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   Fitzwater quoted Gorbachev as telling Bush, ``What you're
telling me is that the U.S. is not just satisfied to let this
happen but is going to take an active role with the Soviet Union in
terms of economic and political reforms.''
   Quoting Gorbachev further, the spokesman reported, ``He said `I
am taking a prudent and cautious approach and I'm glad to hear you
are, too.'''

Alexander Dubcek, whose 1968 reforms were crushed by a Warsaw Pact
invasion, addresses 250,000 cheering demonstrators in Prague. In
Romania, Communist Party chief Nicolae Ceausescu, the East bloc's
longest-ruling leader, is reappointed in lavish show of support for
his rejection of reforms.
   NOV. 26 _ In Hungary's first free vote in more than four
decades, opposition groups narrowly win a referendum that postpones
presidential election, giving them more time to organize against
Communists.
   NOV. 27 _ Millions of Czechoslovak workers observe a two-hour
general strike, demonstrating labor's support for the pro-democracy
movement.
   NOV. 28 _ The Czechoslovak Parliament scraps the constitutional
provision that ensured the leading role of the Communist Party.
   NOV. 30 _ The Czechoslovak government announces it will remove
fortifications along Czechoslovak-Austrian border, and the Interior
Ministry says virtually all restrictions on travel to West will be
lifted Dec. 4.

<TEXT>
   The new committee temporarily guiding East
Germany's Communists includes the country's former spymaster, a
lawyer for the New Forum opposition group, and several well-known
reformers.
   It is faced with the seemingly impossible task of rescuing the
embattled party.
   The 25-member ``working committee'' was announced Sunday after
party leader Egon Krenz, the ruling Politburo, and the Central
Committee resigned.
   The best-known member of the committee is Markus Wolf, the
retired and respected legendary spy chief, who stepped down in 1987
as deputy minister of state security.
   Wolf has become a major supporter of reforms but has also been
criticized by opposition leaders who say he has ``too many
skeletons'' in the closet.
   The head of the committee is Erfurt party chief Herbert Kroker,
who was once stripped of various duties by Guenter Mittag, the
economics czar under now-ousted leader Erich Honecker.
   Another member of the working committee is Gregor Gysi, well
known as the attorney for the 200,000-strong New Forum opposition
group. Gysi drafted the official petition seeking legal status for
New Forum.
   No prominent New Forum members were appointed to the committee.
   Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer, one of the first politicians
to meet with New Forum, is also a member of the panel.
   Earlier this month, Berghofer was quoted widely in West German
news media as giving an extremely gloomy forecast of the party's
future, saying ``the people have taken power away from us.''
   Berghofer was also quoted by Stern magazine as saying he was
considering a challenge to Krenz for the post of party chief,
although he later backed away from that position.
   The popular reformist premier, Hans Modrow, is not a member of
the committee but will effectively be in charge of the government
until a new Politburo and Central Committee are selected at a
three-day congress starting Dec. 15. Modrow was asked to serve on
the committee but said his job as premier kept him too busy.
   Like Kroker, the head of the committee, Modrow himself was the
target of a Honecker-era inquisition and virtually exiled for years
to his power base in Dresden.

   Pop star Elton John says he's selling his share of
the Watford soccer club but will stay on as ``life president.''
   John, 42, rejuvenated the English league team on the northwest
outskirts of London when he became its chairman in 1977 after being
a board member for three years. Now he's stepping down as chairman
and selling out, but he'll maintain a link.
   ``I'm pleased to have been able to ensure the financial security
of the club and the new owners certainly have ambitious plans for
the future,'' The Mail quoted him as saying Sunday.
   ``I have been asked to stay on as life president, which I'm
delighted to do as I can maintain an involvement with my many
frinds at Watford and continue my support of the club.'' No details
of the sale were given.
   In 1978, John appointed a new manager who took Watford from the
fourth division to the first in five seasons. Watford dropped back
to the second division at the end of the 1987-88 season.
   As part of his help to the team, John reportedly forgave a $2.1
million debt the team owed him.

   Princess Farah Diba Pahlavi's black
Labrador retriever is back in the dog house after jumping a wall at
her estate and attacking a neighbor's terrier.
   Pahlavi, widow of the Shah of Iran, wasn't home Thursday when
the Labrador retriever bit Pepper, a smaller, gray-and-white dog.
So the princess' caretaker, Niels Christiansen, was issued two
summons by police: one for allowing a dog to roam and another for
allowing a dog to create a nuisance.
   The summonses carried a total fine of $80.
   Pahlavi was not home and could not be reached for comment.
   Christiansen told police the retriever apparently got out of the
heavily guarded mansion when another worker inadvertently left a
door open.
   Animal Control Warden Richard Magee said neighbors have
complained in the past about the retriever's getting loose and
causing problems.
   Pahlavi's husband was forced to flee Iran in 1979 when followers
of the late Ayatollah Khomeini seized power. The Shah died in exile
in 1980.

   A Soviet rocker says it doesn't matter where you
are, youth still clamor for music about the same things: sex, drugs
and rock 'n' roll.
   ``It's different drugs but the problem is the same,'' said
Alexei Belov, lead guitarist for the Soviet heavy-metal band Gorky
Park, which played in Dallas on Friday.
   ``Politics are different but people are the same,'' Belov said.
``People make love the same all over the world and people have
difficulties and cry the same all over the world.''
   Gorky Park performed with Motley Crue, Ozzy Osbourne and Bon
Jovi at the Moscow Music Peace Festival recently. The Soviet
rockers also collaborated on a ``Make a Difference Foundation''
album which benefits efforts to curb drug and alcohol abuse.
   The band's members said they are now making as much in one night
as the average Soviet citizen makes in six months.

   Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, founder of
Transcendental Meditation and one-time guru to the Beatles, is
proposing a City of Immortals somewhere in Oklahoma to start
building his vision of Heaven on Earth.
   Representatives of the Indian guru met with developers Saturday
in Oklahoma City to discuss plans for a low-density housing
community proposed by the Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development
Corp. It is one of several such communities planned across the
nation, backers said.
   Backers said the communities would be ``noise-free,
pollution-free and free from crime and anxiety.''
   Scott Demaree, a Stillwater builder who acts as Oklahoma liaison
for the Mailbu, Calif.-based corporation, said it was hoped ground
could be broken as early as April near Tulsa, Oklahoma City or
Stillwater. Homes, which would be set on a minimum one-acre plot,
would range from $60,000 to several hundred thousand dolllars,
Demaree said.
   Demaree and other backers said the community would not be
limited to followers of the maharishi and would not be used to
recruit followers.
   Although the Beatles called the maharishi their guru in the
1960s, they later rejected him and his teachings. Demaree said the
City of Immortals is but a small part of the maharishi's master
plan to reconstruct the entire world.

   The woman who co-founded the
United Farmworkers Union was honored for her commitment to civil
rights at a star-studded dinner attended by Jane Fonda, Edward
James Olmos and others.
   Dolores Huerta was singled out because her work as a labor
organizer put her ``at the very foundation of the struggle for
equality in the United States,'' said Ramona Ripston, executive
director of the America Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California, which sponsored the event.
   She was given the group's Eason Monroe Courageous Advocate Award.
   Others feted at Saturday's dinner at the Registry Hotel were
songwriters Alan and Marilyn Bergman, for being long time
supporters of ACLU, and filmmakers Paula Weinstein and Mark
Rosenberg, who were recognized for bringing their 1960s activism
into their 1980s professions.
   Awards presenters included Olmos, Miss Fonda and Norman
Lear.Among those who attended were UFW leader Cesar Chavez, actress
Cybill Shepherd, actor Lloyd Bridges and his actor sons Beau and
Jeff, Tom and Dick Smothers, and Sen. Alan Cranston, a California

   About 100 people, many in Confederate
costumes and carrying Civil War-era weapons, gathered under grey
skies to mark the centennial of the death of Confederate President
Jefferson Davis.
   Although the 5-foot pedestal was once defaced with graffiti
denouncing the statue as racist, no pickets or hecklers were around
as a Marine band tuned up for the ceremonies Saturday.
   ``One of the main things I've tried to bring to the public's
attention is that Jefferson Davis is always thought of as president
of the Confederate States of America but that people have no
realization that that was four years out of his 80-year life,''
said Davis' great-great-grandson, Bertram Hayes-Davis of Dallas.
   ``He was a great American patriot, a tremendous scholar and
certainly one of the ablest leaders of that time.''
   Jefferson Davis died Dec. 6, 1889. During his life, he was a
U.S. representative and senator, a hero in the Mexican War, and a
member of President Franklin Pierce's Cabinet, said Hayes-Davis,
head of the Davis Family Foundation.
   It wasn't the family who restored the monument, but a committee
led by Pierre McGraw, who lives in a small building next to the
mansion where Jefferson Davis died.
   It bothered him that Davis' funerary centennial seemed destined
to pass unnoticed and that the 78-year-old statue and other
Confederate numents on Jefferson Davis Parkway were in disrepair.
   A committee organized by McGraw fixed up the monument and held a
two-day commemoration including a reception at Gallier Hall, where
his body lay in state for three days before burial in Metairie
Cemetery. The burial turned out to be temporary: In 1892, Davis'
remains were moved to Richmond, Va.
   McGraw said it cost about $20,000 in services and donations to
erase graffiti, shore up the monument, cut back brush and landscape
the area around the statue's base.

<TEXT>
   A process that sets tiny bacteria to work
gobbling up the sticky, black creosote found on scrap wood has
become the focus of scientists and politicians concerned about the
environmental hazards of offshore woodburning.
   Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., announced last week that the
Environmental Protection Agency agreed to put the hungry
microorganisms to the test.
   ``Everything in nature apparently goes back to its original
state at some point. There are little helpers that help it get
there,'' he explained. ``I'm encouraged because the process is
going to move forward.''
   With a ban on offshore woodburning going into effect Jan. 1,
1991, Saxton and others have been looking for alternatives to
disposing of telephone poles, railroad ties and driftwood by
incineration or landfill.
   Thousands of tons of the wood _ about 97 percent of it treated
with the unpleasant-smelling wood preservative _ are collected each
year. The Army Corps of Engineers tears down old piers along New
York Harbor to make way for redevelopment and the Coast Guard
gathers driftwood from the harbor.
   The wood has been burned for two decades on barges about 20
miles off Point Pleasant, N.J., fueling concerns about air
pollution.
   Saxton arranged a meeting in New York with regional EPA
officials, the Army Corps, environmental officials from New York
and New Jersey and Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., to discuss the
feasibility of so-called bioremediation. The process ideally would
turn the wood into harmless sawdust that could be used as mulch.
   ``Hopefully, when the lab work is completed, we'll know whether
it can be used on a large-scale basis, whether the end-product can
be easily disposed of, and whether it is cost-effective,'' Saxton
said.
   The bacterial process allows the microorganisms to feed on
creosote until it is neutralized, he said.
   Saxton requested the EPA meeting after a session at his
Washington office with representatives of Alpha Environmental Inc.
of Austin, Texas.
   Dan Kuykendall, Alpha executive vice president, said the firm
often employs oil-eating bacteria in environmental cleanups.
   Saxton, a member of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, asked Alpha about applying their cleanup techniques to
creosote.
   Using tiny quantities in an eight-day trial earlier this month,
researchers in Austin were able to reduce phenol, the main element
in creosote, by 80 percent in one batch of wood Saxton shipped from
New Jersey. They used organisms that occur naturally, said
Kuykendall, a former congressman from Memphis.
   ``We got enough results that we felt we could go to Congressman
Saxton,'' Kuykendall said. ``I think the odds are better than 50-50
we could do something.''
   Should the EPA test phase prove promising, research would
proceed to a full-scale demonstration with about 100 tons of wood,
Kuykendall said.

   A woman says her secret to staying married
for 70 years is quite simple: If you have an argument, don't sweat
it, forget it.
   Sylvester ``Bud'' Roach and his wife, Jessie, were married in a
simple ceremony on Dec. 4, 1919. For those 70 years, they've been
inseparable, family members sayd.
   Mrs. Roach, 88, said she discovered how to get along with her
husband when she was a newlywed.
   ``I learned a long time ago there was no use arguing with him,''
Mrs. Roach said. ``He could say whatever he wants to you, just
forget he said it.''
   The Roaches, who were celebrating Sunday with an open house,
said their faith in God helped keep them together through major
surgery and illness. ``I can't help but see the Lord had a hand in
it,'' said Roach, 90.
   The pair were childhood friends while growing up in a small town
in Illinois. But when he started courting her, ``her mom ran me off
like a stray dog,'' he said. ``When the sun went down, it was time
for me to go.''
   The couple spent most of their first seven years together in
Swan River Valley in northern Manitoba in Canada. The nearest town,
Minitonas, was four miles away.
   Two of their six children were born in Canada. One was born
without the assistance of a doctor because 4 feet of snow blanketed
the countryside one 20-degree night. A neighbor came to help
instead.
   A daughter, Juanita Tucker of Hobart, said her parents are kept
private what disagreements they had.
   ``I can't imagine them being apart,'' she said. ``They live for
each other.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's first
post-summit business Monday will be to brief leaders of a radically
reshaped Warsaw Pact, and for the first time a non-communist will
sit at the table.
   The appearance at the Moscow meeting of Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity figure, will be a startling
development. But tumultuous events in East Germany on Sunday lent
an even greater aura of suspense to the meeting Gorbachev will host.
   East German Communist Party leader Egon Krenz and his entire
Politburo resigned and a 25-member panel of reformers took over
temporary leadership in a desperate effort to rescue the Communist
Party. Krenz relinquished a post he'd held less than six weeks.
Although he retained the largely ceremonial title of president, it
was unclear whether he would make the Moscow meeting and there was
no early indication who would represent East Germany.
   What was known was that several Eastern European leaders will be
attending their first Warsaw Pact leadership meeting. These include
Petar Mladenov of Bulgaria and Karel Urbanek of Czechoslovakia.
   In another first for the alliance, the head of the out-of-power
Polish Communist Party apparently will not be invited at all.
   Hardline leader Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania is the only East
bloc leader to reject the epic transformations. With the recent
fall of orthodox communist leaders like Erich Honecker in East
Germany and Milos Jakes in Czechoslovakia, he is likely to find
himself at this session to be more isolated than ever before.
   The meeting takes place in an atmosphere of ongoing crisis in
the communist world.
   The entire East German Communist Party Politburo quit Sunday
along with Krenz, and a new government unveiled Sunday in
Czechoslovakia failed to satisfy opponents, who pledged more mass
demonstrations.
   It has been five months since top leaders of the Warsaw Pact
last met June 7-8 in Bucharest and said that each member country
had the ``right to make its own political lines, strategy and
tactics without any outside interference.''
   Since then, the Solidarity movement assumed the helm of Poland's
government, the Hungarian Communist Party dissolved itself, East
Germany was forced to open the Berlin Wall, Czechoslovakian
communists have conceded past errors and promised free elections,
and the bloc's longest-reigning hardliner, Todor Zhivkov, abruptly
resigned after 35 years in power in Bulgaria and was replaced by a
reformer.
   The sweeping changes in Eastern Europe were a centerpiece theme
of the weekend discussions between Gorbachev and Bush on the Soviet
passenger liner Maxim Gorky docked in Malta's Marsaxlokk Bay.
   Rather than expressing any anxiety about the changes in the
region, Gorbachev said at his joint news conference with Bush after
the summit that he welcomed them.
   ``I'm encouraged and inspired by all these processes,''
Gorbachev said. They are ``connected with the desire of these
peoples to ennoble their societies, to make them more democratic
and humanitarian and to open up to the rest of the world.''
   Gorbachev said he and Bush agreed ``that the world leaves one
epoch of Cold War, and enters another epoch. This is just the
beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, a long
road to a long-lasting, peaceful period.''
   The Warsaw Pact, founded in the Polish capital in 1955 in
response to the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, is
itself an outgrowth of the Cold War.
   Now, Gorbachev said, both the Warsaw Pact and NATO will have to
change.
   They ``should not remain military alliances, but rather
military-political alliances and later on, just political
alliances,'' he said.
   For his part, Bush said he and Gorbachev discussed the situation
in Eastern Europe in ``considerably more detail'' than he could
disclose, and expressed broad approval.
   ``There is enormous support in our country for what Chairman
Gorbachev is doing inside the Soviet Union,'' Bush said. ``There is
enormous respect and support for the way he has advocated peaceful
change in Europe.''
   But he indicated that the United States did not press for any
sort of acceleration in the process. ``I don't think it is a role
for the United States to dictate the rapidity of change in any
country. It's a matter for the people to determine themselves,''
Bush said.

<HEAD>East German Prison Inmates on Hunger Strike in Demand for Amnesty</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inmates at several East German prisons are
staging work stoppages and hunger strikes to demand a general
amnesty in keeping with the spirit of reform sweeping the country,
the state news agency said Sunday.
   The ADN news agency quoted spokesmen for an inmates' committees
as saying prisoners should get a chance to start anew while the
country is in the midst of its political changes.
   It was the second day that ADN reported prison unrest in East
Germany, where the Communist Party Politburo and Central Committee
resigned Sunday in the continuing political upheaval.
   ADN gave no figure on the number of prisoners involved in
amnesty demands but said: ``The inmates of the (East) Berlin prison
have demanded better living conditions and more pay for their
work.''
   In earlier reports, it said inmates at prisons in Bautzen and
near Potsdam had stopped working or gone on hunger strikes
demanding amnesty, better living conditions and higher pay for work.
   ADN quoted one prisoner as saying, ``The real criminals, who
have cheated the people out of millions, are free and have the
possibility to avoid punishment.''
   He was referring to disclosures by the ruling Communist Party
that three ex-Politburo members have been arrested and charged with
corruption and other former party officials are under investigation.
   Interior Ministry officials have acknowledged that inmates in
prisons in Leipzig and Dresden and at a youth reformatory in
Frankfurt an der Oder have made similar demands recently.
   ADN said striking prisoners have met with prison officials and
representatives of Protestant churches and opposition groups to
discuss their grievances.
   In some cases, prison officials offered more liberal visiting
rights and freer exchange of letters, ADN said.
   Overcrowding at the prison near Potsdam can be reduced by
transferring 400 inmates to other facilities, it reported.
   Officials have rejected a general amnesty because of the
seriousness of the offenses committed by some prisoners, according
to ADN. It said many of the inmates at the East Berlin prison were
``repeat offenders who had previously been set free under a general
amnesty.''
   The news agency did not say if any of the striking inmates were
political prisoners.

   EAST GERMANY _ Communist Party leader Egon Krenz, the ruling
Politburo and the party's Central Committee resign and a 25-member
panel of reformers is named to lead the party until a special party
congress Dec. 15.
   The Communists oust former party leader Erich Honecker and 11
other disgraced officials from the party, including former Premier
Willi Stoph, and announce the arrests of three former Politburo
members on corruption charges.
   A top state trade official flees the country after reports he is

corruption in ranks.

   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ Opposition protests swell again as Communist
leaders name a new government but retain 13 Communists from the
last Cabinet and include only five non-Communists.
   The Civic Forum demands another Cabinet within a week and calls
a mass protest Monday to press its demand. Workers threaten a
general strike if a new government is not installed.
   As its first act, the government condemns the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion that crushed reforms in Czechoslovakia and proposes talks
with the Soviet Union on the future of the 80,000 Red Army soldiers
in Czechoslovakia since the invasion.
   President Gustav Husak, the last holdout from the leaders
installed after the invasion, indicates he may be ready to step
down.

<HEAD>Government Rejects Drug Trafficker Truce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Sunday rejected a truce
declared by drug traffickers in their bombing campaign and said
accepting it would leave the country in the hands of the
traffickers.
   ``We will continue battling them because if we don't, we will
cease to govern,'' Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds said.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel has announced that beginning Monday,
it will observe a ``cease-fire'' in its terrorist campaign with the
aim of persuading Congress to approve a national vote on the
government's extradition policy.
   The government has extradited Colombian drug suspects to the
United States as part of a crackdown on cocaine cartels that began
Aug. 18 after a leading presidential candidate and anti-drug
crusader was assassinated.
   The administration of President Virgilio Barco so far has
extradited nine suspects. The traffickers have responded with 200
bombings that have killed 29 people and injured 238.
   Barco departed Sunday for a four-day visit to Japan and after a
farewell ceremony at the airport, Lemos Simmonds reiterated the
administration's opposition to a national vote on its extradition
policy.
   ``If the government accepted this proposal, the country would be
left to be governed by the desires of drug traffickers,'' he told
reporters.
   A congressional committee on Friday attached the referendum
proposal to legislation that would reform Colombia's constitution.
   Lemos Simmonds accused members of the committee of being
``accomplices of drug trafficking.''
   He said the traffickers would stage a violent campaign of
intimidation if there were a national vote on extradition.
   Barco indicated Saturday that the government would prefer to
kill the constitutional reform legislation rather than let it pass
with the referendum bill attached.
   Abandoning reforms would endanger peace negotiations with the
April M19 Movement, the only one of Colombia's five main guerrilla
groups that has accepted an official peace plan.
   The legislation contains provisions for the guerrilla group to
run candidates for Congress. Its leader, Carlos Pizarro, has said
the guerrillas would lay down their arms on Dec. 19, provided that
the government passes the reform legislation.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen opened fire on the information
minister's convoy Sunday in southeast Beirut, police said. It was
the second attack in two days on the official, who is a foe of
Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Police said no one was hurt in the shooting, which targeted
Information Minister Edmond Rizk and his three-car convoy.
   On Saturday, a bomb was tossed at Rizk's house in Jezzine. No
one was hurt.
   Rizk, a Maronite Christian, blamed the first attack on ``General
Aoun and agents recruited to undermine the whole of Lebanon.''
   He had no immediate comment after the second attack, carried out
by several men with rifles. No one claimed responsibility for it.
   Also Sunday, Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Aoun is leading
Lebanon to ``national suicide'' but appeared to rule out a military
attack to evict him from the presidential palace.
   In a statement to The Associated Press, Hoss said that ``General
Aoun has become an outlaw, leading a mutiny that will result only
in partitioning Lebanon.''
   ``If he replaces the Taif accord, that will mean national
suicide.''
   The Taif accord is an Arab-brokered peace plan approved in
October by Lebanese legislators who met in Taif, Saudi Arabia. Aoun
opposes the accord because it does not include a timetable for
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   The accord cleared the way for election of a president, and
Parliament chose Rene Mouawad. He was killed by a bomb after 17
days and was replaced by Elias Hrawi.
   Aoun rejected the presidential election and has refused to leave
the presidential palace, which he took over last year after being
named head of an interim military Cabinet pending a presidential
election.
   He now is holding out with 20,000 troops in the Christian
heartland north and northeast of Beirut.
   Syria last week added to its military strength in Lebanon with
massive reinforcements around the main gateways to the Christian
region, sparking fears of a military move to evict Aoun.
   At the superpower summit Sunday off the Mediterranean island of
Malta, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said Sunday he agreed
with President Bush that the superpowers should do ``our very
best'' to help bring peace to Lebanon.
   ``There's a real chance of taking a decisive step to open a
process of a settlement,'' Gorbachev told a news conference.
   Bush said: ``We have found that the Soviet Union is playing a
constructive role in the Lebanon and trying throughout the Middle
East'' to support a settlement. He apparently was referring to
Moscow's influence with Syria.
   However, the two leaders made no specific proposals.
   ``We are determined to confront the Aoun phenomenon ... because
it is partitioning Lebanon,'' Hoss said. ``We shall use all
peaceful political means available to end this mutiny.''
   He said the cease-fire Sept. 22 that halted six months of
fighting between Aoun's forces and Syrian troops must be backed up
politically.
   ``We do not want to go back to war, but we should not forget the
cruel lessons we have learned that a truce cannot be translated
into peace and stability unless it is coupled with political
reconciliation to solve the crisis,'' Hoss said.
   Syria's troops were deployed in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to quell civil war fighting. Aoun contends they betrayed
their mission by siding with the Moslems against the Christians in
the 14-year-old civil war.

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said
he is ready to sign an immediate cease-fire with Angola's Marxist
government to end 14 years of civil war.
   Savimbi spoke to reporters in Kinshasa on Saturday night after
meetings with Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko. He has been at the
center of negotiations between Savimbi's U.S.-backed UNITA rebels
and Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.
   ``We now are ready to sign this accord, any time and any
place,'' said Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, known as UNITA.
   A previous cease-fire agreement reached June 22 in a
face-to-face meeting between Dos Santos and Savimbi quickly broke
down.
   The Cuban-backed Angolan government agreed to a new cease-fire
proposal in November.
   Sources close to the talks in Kinshasa, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a formal cease-fire agreement could be signed
before the end of the year, although no exact date was given.
   Mobutu, who visited the Angolan capital of Luanda two weeks ago,
said he had received a response to his cease-fire proposal from Dos
Santos and that he discussed the Luanda meeting with Savimbi on
Saturday. He declined to provide details, however.
   The civil war began after Angola gained its independence from
Portugal in 1975 and UNITA lost a power struggle to the Marxist
Popular Liberation Movement of Angola.

<HEAD>Report: Former HUD Secretary Gave Grant to Developer for NJ Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce
Jr. reportedly gave a $350,000 development grant to a friend for
two New Jersey proposals that never went into operation, officials
said Sunday.
   According to Housing and Urban Development documents, the 1985
grant was made to a Washington consulting firm, the Center for
Resource Development, even though other HUD officials had rejected
the award, The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions.
   The firm's principal was Samuel P. Singletary, a longtime friend
of Pierce. The grant was made from one of two discretionary funds
under Pierce's control, the Times reported.
   Singletary had managed Pierce's two unsuccessful campaigns for
election as a judge in New York City in 1959 and 1960. He told The
Times that he had met with Pierce several times at HUD, but had
never discussed the grant. He denied that Pierce had done him a
favor.
   Pierce told the Times through a lawyer, Robert E. Plotkin, that
he did not remember the grant to Singletary.
   HUD confirmed that there had been opposition to the grant to
Singletary's group for the economic development projects in Camden
and East Orange, two New Jersey cities with blighted central
districts.
   East Orange Mayor John Hatcher Jr. told The Associated Press on
Sunday that Singletary proposed a commercial project in two
abandoned buildings in the city's Ampere section.
   ``And as far as I understand, they were pretty well set with the
project as far as plans were concerned,'' Hatcher said. But the
proposal never went beyond the discussions, he said.
   Hatcher said most discussions with Singletary and his firm would
have been by city planners and that he didn't ``get involved in
technical details or get into a big dissertation with them.''
   Camden Mayor Melvin ``Randy'' Primas also said he didn't
remember the details but added, ``I think I remember the man, but
nothing ever happened. We're always getting developers in.''
   DuBois L. Gilliam, a former Pierce aide who managed the
discretionary fund programs, told the Times that Pierce ordered him
to give the grant to Singletary even though other HUD officials
opposed the grant, arguing that Singletary's group lacked
experience.
   Gilliam said Singletary had repeatedly contacted Pierce, who
``told me he wanted us to help Singletary get some money. He said
Singletary was a good guy.''
   Gilliam pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges involving
other HUD grants and is scheduled to begin serving an 18-month
sentence, the Times said.
   Even if the grant had been made, there was nothing improper
about it, Plotkin said, since Pierce had the right to use the money
under HUD's Technical Assistance program at his discretion.
   The Times said Singletary's group originally approached HUD in
1985 for nearly $1 million for the New Jersey projects. A HUD
official who talked to the Times on condition he not be identified
said the proposal was rejected because of concern over its cost and
the relative inexperience of Singletary's group.
   The group scaled back the proposal, and the $350,000 grant was
approved through HUD's regional office in New York.

<HEAD>Tamil Rebels Kill 17 Sinhalese Soldiers, Military Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels ambushed an army truck
and killed 17 Sinhalese soldiers Sunday in a northern district, a
military official reported. He said the killers first attacked with
grenades and then sprayed the truck with rifle fire, killing all
the soldiers who were returning to base from a trip to market in
Vavunia district. Vavunia is about 110 miles north of Colombo.
   The official, who was not identified in line with army
regulations, blamed the attack on ethnic Tamil insurgents.
   In another development, a government official reported that 115
anti-government Sinhalese had surrendered to army units since
Friday.
   He said air force helicopters had dropped 350,000 leaflets in
southern, central and northern parts of Sri Lanka appealing to
Sinhalese militants to give themselves up.
   Sinhalese militants launched their own uprising after the
government signed an Indian-sponsored peace accord in 1987 aimed at
ending the Tamil insurgency. The accord offered Tamils limited
autonomy if they would give up their weapons. But Sinhalese
militants took up arms, saying the pact gave to many concessions to
the Tamils, who have been fighting to establish their own country
in northeastern Sri Lanka since 1983.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 16 million,
and the Sinhalese make up 75 percent.
   The Tamils, who are generally Hindus, claim discrimination by
the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese.
   Sinhalese militants also object to the presence of Indian
peacekeeping forces in this island nation off India's southern
coast. The Indian troops came here as part of the 1987 agreement to
help disarm the Tamil rebels, but many of the insurgents rejected
the pact and battled the Indians.
   About 28,000 Indian soldiers remain in Sri Lanka, but India has
said all will be withdrawn by Dec. 31.
   More than 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian troopers, have
been killed since 1983 in the Tamil revolt. About 5,000 were killed
in the Sinhalese uprising.

<HEAD>Black `Soldiers' Re-Enact Their Civil War Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN STRAUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No black soldiers fought at the Battle of
Franklin, but 125 years later black Civil War re-enactors are
reminding their fellow history buffs of the contributions
African-Americans made in the war.
   A re-enactment of the 1864 battle Sunday capped a weekend of
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the fight. In it
Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood lost more than 6,000 soldiers,
crippling the South's second-biggest force, the Army of Tennessee.
   The recreation attracted an estimated 4,000 re-enactors from
around the country. Similar battles will lead up to the 125th
anniversary of the surrender at Appomattox on April 9.
   The recreations feature lines of ``soldiers'' firing replica
weapons, booming cannon and cavalry charges. ``Casualties'' fall to
the ground, though there are rules: Don't fall with a loaded weapon
or with a bayonet.
   In one of the few deviations allowed from the historical record,
the Union forces at a field about 20 miles south of Nashville this
weekend included about two dozen black re-enactors representing the
54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.
   Gregory Urwin, a history professor at the University of Central
Arkansas in Conway and leader of the 54th, said about 180,000 black
soldiers fought in the Civil War.
   They were allowed to join in 1863 after the Emancipation
Proclamation and eventually made up 10 percent of the Union army.
   ``There was an initial reluctance, a fear of a backlash, that
white Northerners would fight to preserve the union but not to end
slavery,'' said Urwin. ``And there was a fear that Southerners
would fight twice as hard if blacks were armed against them.''
   Black soldiers served with distinction in the Battle of
Nashville, where they helped lead one of the attacks that allowed
Union troops to turn the Confederates back. They were also active
in the siege of Petersburg, Va., and several divisions were among
the Union units that helped stop Gen. Robert E. Lee's retreat at
Appomattox.
   ``The first black units that were raised performed well in
combat. And by that point in the war, heavy losses and frequent
defeats made more Northerners willing to accept any kind of extra
manpower,'' Urwin said.
   Black participation in the war was used to justify the passage
of the 14th Amendment, making them citizens, and the 15th, which
gave them the right to vote.
   ``Without those Constitutional weapons there would have been no
civil rights movement in our own time,'' said Urwin. ``So, in a
sense, the black troops of the Civil War were the pioneers in the
revolution in race relations that we've lived through the past 25
or 30 years.''
   Urwin said the Franklin recreation is a good chance for his
group to remind history buffs of the contribution of black soldiers.
   ``It's a chance, finally, 125 years after, for black and white
Americans to get together and celebrate their common heritage of
valor.''
   The re-enactors have a passion for accuracy in their portrayals,
wearing authentic wool uniforms and camping out without sleeping
bags, as did soldiers of the period.
   Urwin, 34, had no ancestors in the war but has an interest that
goes beyond the scholarship of his military history interest.
   ``I get the chill like everybody else,'' he said. ``There are
certain moments, like when twilight is falling over the camp and
the spectators have departed.
   ``You look and all you see is the 19th century: sentinels are
marching their beats, people are beginning to light their
campfires. That's one moment when you can almost fool yourself into
thinking that you're back in time.''

<HEAD>Heavy Snow Continues In Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 18 inches of snow fell Sunday over parts of the Northeast,
and cold air covered much of the nation east of the Rockies with
highs only in the teens from Minnesota to northern New England.
   A storm centered off the coast of Maine dumped heavy snow over
much of the state, and high wind in the wake of the storm produced
squalls with heavy snow in the Great Lakes region.
   Southern and central Maine got 6 to 14 inches of snow from late
Saturday into Sunday, while snow squalls in the lower Great Lakes
region buried parts of western New York state, with up to 18 inches
at West Valley, south-southeast of Buffalo.
   Up to 8 inches of snow blanketed Vermont from Saturday into
Sunday, and totals along the northern and western lake shores of
Michigan ranged up to 13 inches. In northern Indiana, up to 13
inches fell at Michiana and up to a foot fell along the Lake Erie
shore in Ohio.
   Strong, gusty wind accompanied the snow in the Northeast,
causing considerable blowing and drifting of snow and producing
wind chill readings well below zero.
   During the late morning, wind gusts reaching 60 mph were
reported at Johnstown, Pa.
   Low temperatures early Sunday dipped into the teens and single
digits from the northern and central High Plains through the Ohio
Valley and the Great Lakes to northern New England, with subzero
readings in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota.
   Afternoon temperatures were generally below freezing from the
Dakotas and the lower Missouri Valley to the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast, with readings mostly in the teens from Minnesota
through the Great Lakes region to northern New England.
   But strong wind blowing down the eastern slopes of the Rockies
brought mild temperatures to the High Plains region with afternoon
readings in the 40s and 50s as far north as Montana.
   The cold air was heading south with the coldest air so far this
season expected in Florida on Monday. Lows Monday should range from
the mid 20s in the Florida Panhandle to the mid to upper 40s in the
Keys, forecast the National Weather Service in Coral Gables.
   Elsewhere, a cold front produced showers over the northern
Pacific Coast, with less than an inch of rain during the six hours
up to 1 p.m. EST.
   Showers brought locally heavy rain to the lower Rio Grande
Valley of Texas late Saturday and early Sunday. Alice, west of
Corpus Christi, got 1.52 inches in the 24 hours up to 7 a.m. EST.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 10 below zero at
International Falls, Minn.

   It took a lot of pull to become the first female
motorcycle police officer in Dallas.
   In fact, D.K. Lowe had to pull up all 750 pounds of her
department-issued Kawasaki 1000 many times a day. The exercise is
required of all Dallas motorcycle officers.
   The 37-year-old policewoman, who stands 5-foot-4, said recently
that there were many times, especially toward the end of the day,
that the motorcycle seemed to weigh a ton and she wondered, ``What
am I doing here?''
   But she managed to pull up her bike each and every time during
her six weeks of training. Last week, she won the shoulder patch
with wings designating her a motorcycle officer.
   She'll have to wait a bit for her boots, however.
   Ms. Lowe was issued a pair of size-7, knee-high boots in black
leather, the smallest in stock, and has had to wear three pairs of
socks to make them fit. Now that she's passed her training, the
department has ordered new boots.
   ``I'm lucky,'' said Ms. Lowe. ``The balls of my feet do touch
the ground. Well, at least one of them.''
   Despite motorcycle officers' tough image, Ms. Lowe said she
plans to add a dash of femininity.
   ``My motto is: I don't put that helmet on without putting my
lipstick on,'' she said.

   Patrick McLynn has the perfect Christmas
gift suggestion for the person who has everything, including a car
that works: a Batmobile that doesn't.
   It won't be cheap. The college student, who won the ``Batman''
movie car and $25,000 in an MTV contest, is hoping to get $125,000
to $330,000 for the sleek, black car and is seeking sealed bids
from around the world. The deadline: Dec. 20.
   ``My accountant thinks it's going to be more lucrative if we try
for somebody in California,'' he said. ``Somebody who's going to
want to sit on this thing for an investment or just for laughs and
has that kind of money ...''
   The Batmobile, a prototype that was one of three cars built for
``Batman,'' has another drawback. It doesn't have a working engine.
   McLynn already has received two bids from Hollywood Productions
Inc., which built the Batmobiles.
   The company initially offered $4,000, then upped that to $25,000
or a brand-new Corvette _ with an engine. McLynn's main form of
transportation is a motorcyle.
   Estimates of what it cost Hollywood Productions to build the
vehicle range from $16,000 to $60,000.
   McLynn's uncle, Andy Grimes, has been handling most of the
inquiries about the Batmobile.
   ``We're now in the process of weeding out the people who bid
just to get a hand in it so they can tell people they had a shot at
the Batmobile,'' Grimes said.

   Things seemed amiss at the Eastern
Cemetery for years. There were complaints about poor upkeep. A
stray human bone was found in 1986. There was a lawsuit when a
newly purchased grave was found to be occupied.
   But only when a gravedigger tipped Jim Caldwell, an investigator
for the state attorney general, last spring did the astounding
details begin to emerge.
   Authorities say as many as 48,000 people were buried in already
occupied graves in Eastern Cemetery and Greenwood Cemetery. Both
cemeteries, on Louisville's east side, are owned by the Louisville
Crematory &amp; Cemeteries Co.
   Caldwell reported finding dozens of infants buried too shallow,
some as little as 10 inches below the surface, at Eastern Cemetery,
and remains of more than 200 cremated bodies, many unidentified,
shelved in the cellar of the crematory.
   For an undetermined number of people, their ``final resting
place'' was neither final nor restful.
   A 60-count indictment issued in July alleges that some remains
were unearthed so that the graves could be reused; the remains were
then scattered throughout the grounds, mixed into other graves or
put in a storage building.
   The attorney general obtained the indictment and filed a lawsuit
against the 145-year-old company and three former officers _
Charles Alexander Jr., who was its executive director; Clifford B.
Amos, who was company president, and Robert Copley, who was vice
president.
   All three men have resigned and pleaded innocent.
   The cemetery company's spokesman, Bill Kinman, did not
immediately return a message Sunday. In the past, the company's
lawyers have said they don't want to comment on pending litigation.
   Criminal charges included corpse abuse, grave desecration,
theft, improper handling of burial payments and failure to keep
adequate funds in perpetual-care and maintenance trust accounts.
The theft charge referred to the money received for care of the
plots the company allegedly failed to provide.
   The civil suit alleged numerous violations of the Kentucky
Consumer Protection Act, including reuse of previously sold or
occupied graves, sales of services never provided, failure to
maintain graves and failure to dispose of cremated remains.
   Trial on the criminal charges is scheduled in February. No date
has been set for a trial on the lawsuit.
   Alexander was hired in 1986 and Copley began work in 1987. Amos
was acting executive director from 1980 to 1986, then became
president. The alleged wrongdoings at Eastern and Greenwood began
long before they joined the company.
   Graves were reused on such a scale that ``it would almost have
to be a matter of policy'' by the company, said Phillip DiBlasi, a
University of Louisville archaeologist who supervised excavations
at the cemeteries under a court order.
   ``It seemed to become a relatively common practice around the
early part of the century,'' DiBlasi said. ``Why it continued until
the whistle was blown, I don't know.''
   Records indicate Eastern Cemetery probably was full shortly
after the turn of the century. It had enough room for about 18,000
bodies under current industry standards, but 51,000 may have been
buried there, according to DiBlasi and Caldwell.
   Caldwell's report also estimated that 15,000 bodies too many
were buried at Greenwood.
   The cemetery company came under scrutiny in May, when Bob Allen,
a gravedigger and maintenance worker for eight years, called the
attorney general's office to report the alleged burial practices,
Caldwell said.
   During the investigation, Caldwell found bones stored throughout
Eastern Cemetery _ in a truck's glove compartment, in a tool box,
in a storage shed, in dirt piles and even in a fast food hamburger
bag, his report said.
   DiBlasi said he had uncovered a number of old headstones or
headstone fragments in Eastern, some of which appeared to have been
deliberately buried.
   Graves that were dug up for reuse typically were very old,
unlikely to be missed by anyone today, DiBlasi said.
   Also, ``these were real poor people,'' he said. ``They're also
in wooden containers, which is real easy to dig through.''

   Weather-weary network crews packed their gear
and left Malta on Sunday after storms there caused hasty changes
and technical problems in their coverage of the summit meeting.
   CBS and NBC coverage Saturday of the meeting between President
Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't much affected,
despite heavy wind and stormy seas that ended plans for afternoon
and dinner meetings that day.
   But the day's 60 mph wind destroyed a studio set CNN had built
near Marsaxlokk Bay, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard
summit, and also blew down and damaged a CNN satellite dish.
   That knocked out CNN's TV signal for eight hours, starting at 9
p.m. EST, although a network spokesman in Malta said most of the TV
blackout occurred when little was going on and no transmissions
were planned.
   Saturday's storm also affected ABC, but only briefly. Rain
shorted out an electrical connection right at the start of ABC
anchorman Peter Jenning's live summit report from Malta during the
first of two ``World News Tonight'' broadcasts that ABC sends its
affiliates each night.
   The broadcast was hurriedly reshaped in Washington while still
on the air. Anchorwoman Carole Simpson reported other news while
the Malta connection was restored, and Jennings came back on with
his report eight minutes later.
   The four networks' anchormen all were in Malta. But only
Jennings was heading to Brussels on Sunday to report Monday night
on Bush's post-summit briefing to NATO leaders. CBS' Dan Rather and
NBC's Tom Brokaw were reported returning to New York, and CNN's
Bernard Shaw was en route to Washington.
   Before Saturday's storm, the networks had planned to transmit
live TV pictures by microwave from the planned sites of the summit
_ two guided missile cruisers, the U.S. Navy's Belknap and the
Soviet navy's Slava.
   But when the storm forced the summit site changed to the safely
docked Soviet luxury ship Maxim Gorky, CBS, running the TV pool for
the U.S. networks, had to scramble to install a microwave linkup to
the Gorky.
   ``They (the Soviets) invited the pool to put a microwave aboard.
... We had to rip things apart to do that,'' Don DeCesare, CBS
News' director of news coverage, said Saturday night from Malta.
``It took all day to do it.''
   But just as technicans had things working, he said, Saturday's
planned second meeting between Bush and Gorbachev was called off.
   The leaders' Sunday news conference on the Gorky was televised
live, with the Soviets providing both the TV pool feed for
broadcasters and an audio channel offering a simultaneous English
translations of Gorbachev's remarks.
   But broadcast woes continued. During the session's last half
hour, an electronic glitch knocked out the English-language audio
channel.
   CBS and ABC continued with their own backup Russian-speaking
translators. NBC hastily brought in a Soviet official on Malta to
help, but missed eight minutes of translation.
   CNN went the long way for help _ to Atlanta. After 13 minutes in
which Shaw recapped summit news while Gorbachev was speaking, an
American woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's
comments.
   The woman was Siobahn Darrow, a CNN staff member. A spokeswoman
said Darrow was listening to and translating Gorbachev's remarks
from CNN headquarters in Atlanta.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former death row inmate Randall Dale Adams
returned to the city where he was convicted of killing a Dallas
policeman, seeking to help others who say they've been wrongly
convicted.
   Adams, who was freed after his case was documented in the movie
``The Thin Blue Line,'' appeared at a benefit dinner Saturday for
the Dallas-based group Justice Denied Research Inc. It was his
first appearance in Dallas since his release from state prison last
March.
   ``Being back here is a little strange. You can understand that
last time I was here I was pretty anxious to leave,'' said Adams,
who was accompanied by his mother, Mildred.
   Adams, who now lives in Columbus, Ohio, spent 12 years behind
bars for the 1976 shooting death of the policeman.
   ``The Thin Blue Line'' questioned the testimony of prosecution
witnesses in the case. A state appeals court subsequently
overturned Adams' conviction and authorities chose not to seek a
retrial.
   Adams plans to begin a 12-day tour of Italy next week to
coincide with the European premiere of the documentary and to speak
at Amnesty International's annual meeting.
   Justice Denied Research is headed by Jim Humphreys, who helped
obtain the information that led to the release of Lenell Geter, an
engineer from South Carolina who spent two years in prison for a
robbery before another suspect was identified.

   The Voice of America, the U.S. government's
broadcast service overseas, will open an office in Warsaw that will
expand its operations in the Eastern bloc to two cities, officials
said Sunday.
   VOA Deputy Director Robert Coonrod said the office in Poland is
the result of ``the openness of the situation there in general and
also because for our audience the story there is very important.''
   The formal announcement will be made in Warsaw on Monday by VOA
Director Richard W. Carlson, VOA spokeswoman Beth Knisley said.
   The VOA also is broadcasting a program simultaneously with
Polish state radio on Monday in which callers in Poland will be
able to speak with economic commentators in Washington about U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter's trade mission last week to
Warsaw, said Coonrod.
   The VOA, which broadcasts in many languages into Eastern bloc
countries, for years was jammed and vilified by the Kremlin. VOA
opened its first bureau in a communist state last year in Moscow.
   Coonrod said the Warsaw office will not be a full bureau and no
full-time correspondent will be assigned there. ``It's not a
full-fledged bureau in part because we don't have the ability at
this point to staff it,'' he said. ``We will have assigned there
temporarily people who speak English or Polish.''
   The Communist Party-led government in Poland had long required
Voice of America workers to apply for a new visa each time the
broadcast agency wanted to cover a story, said Coonrod.
   Government clearance for the new office was allowed when VOA
officials were told they would be granted multiple-entry visas,
allowing quick movement into the country.

   Leaders of the NATO military gathered
Sunday in anticipation of a first-hand report from President Bush
on his Mediterranean summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush arrived at Brussels airport at the dinner hour, where he
was met by Prime Minister Wilfried Martens.
   During airport remarks, Bush said, ``It's an exciting time for
the alliance, for Europe, and for America. ... Tonight we stand at
the crossroads of history on a way to Europe, whole and free. ...
That simple truth is manifested in the thunderous events taking
place as few hundred kilometers to the east. And that simple truth
brought Mikhail Gorbachev and me together in a windswept harbor off
Malta.''
   Bush had dinner here with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at
Chateau Stuyvenberg, the 18th century guest house where the
president is staying. Asked by reporters if he and Gorbachev saw
eye-to-eye on the issue of German reunification, Bush declined to
answer, citing his policy of refusing to accept questions at photo
opportunities.
   Kohl said the summit had continued the progress toward better
East-West relations. ``I think we came forward a great deal on
questions that are elementary to us,'' he said.
   Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, nursing a bad cold,
arrived Sunday evening.
   British officials said she would not comment on the
Bush-Gorbachev summit until after the American president had given
his briefing.
   ``Everything that we've heard does suggests that this was
entirely in line with all of the discussions before the summit
between the prime minister and President Bush,'' said one official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Bush had met with Mrs. Thatcher
on Nov. 24 at Camp David, Md.
   The official said that Bush and Gorbachev ``clearly got on very
well together. That's of very considerable satisfaction to (Mrs.
Thatcher). We've very pleased about it.''
   The leaders of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization
anxiously awaiteded Monday's mini-summit to learn, and leaders were
arriving throughout the day here. The NATO leaders' talks at
alliance headquarters were expected to last until late afternoon
Monday, when Bush was due to fly back to the United States.
   The officials last met in May at a summit marking the alliance's
40th anniversary.
   The atmosphere among the allies was dramatically different from
last spring when the United States and Britain were quarreling with
Germany over plans for upgrading short-range nuclear missiles in
Europe.
   The allies' attention will be focused this time on the momentous
political and economic changes unfolding in Eastern Europe.
   The recent upheavals in the hardline regimes of East Germany,
Bulgaria and Czechoslavakia, combined with the earlier changes in
Poland and Hungary, have reduced the military threat to the West.
   NATO is increasingly under pressure to reassess its role in an
era of dramatically reduced tensions. The leaders' talks could well
touch on the alliance's future strategy.
   In addition to Bush's briefing, the officials were to hear from
Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti about Gorbachev's trip to
his country shortly before the Malta summit. And West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was likely to give his assessment of events
in neighboring East Germany.
   Gorbachev said Sunday that change in Eastern Europe is ``a
problem whose time has come'' and that new approaches were needed.
   But in a joint news conference with Bush at the conclusion of
the Malta talks, the Soviet leader said ``history has willed'''
that there are two Germanys.
   Gorbachev warned against anyone trying to make ``artificial''
changes, apparently referring to calls for unification of East and
West Germany.
   Bush said he made clear to Gorbachev that the United States
doesn't want to do anything ``unrealistic'' about East and West
Germany that ``causes any country to end up going backwards, or end
up having its own people in military conflict, one with the other.''
   He said this was why he was acting cautiously, ``not to go
demonstrating on top of the Berlin Wall to show how happy we are
about the change.''
   Bush said it wasn't up to the United States ``to dictate the
rapidity of change in any country. It's a matter for the people to
determine themselves.''
   ``We think that there is an understanding today in the minds of
all,'' Gorbachev said. ``We don't want to do anything to accelerate
these changes artificially for the peoples of these two great
German states.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told his countrymen
in a broadcast Monday he was impressed by President Bush's realism
at the superpower summit and that the meetings had given a boost to
work on major arms control accords.
   Soviet television broadcast a 25-minute interview with Gorbachev
early Monday after showing the full one-hour news conference that
Gorbachev and Bush gave in Malta after finishing their two days of
talks.
   ``I must say I'm glad I found a lot of realism in Bush's
attitude and I felt his desire, his effort to understand the
processes under way, exchange opinions, to work out approaches,''
Gorbachev said. ``The dialogue actually surpassed my expectations.''
   Gorbachev left the Mediterranean island of Malta after the news
conference and television interview to return to Moscow, where he
will brief members of the Warsaw Pact military alliance on the
summit talks. Bush flew to Brussels, Belgium, to inform other
leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization about the summit.
   Gorbachev, speaking to the television interviewer in Malta, said
there were no firm results from the summit, but he and Bush formed
a basis for wide-ranging agreements on strategic nuclear weapons,
chemical arms, and conventional forces in Europe as well as
economic cooperation.
   U.S.-Soviet relations will become ``more dynamic in all areas,''
Gorbachev said. He added the meeting gave a ``serious impulse'' to
talks on strategic nuclear weapons and expressed the hope that the
two sides could work out remaining differences so the two
presidents can sign an agreement when Gorbachev visits the United
States in June.
   Gorbachev said an agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons,
which the superpowers have been negotiating for years, would be an
``epochal'' treaty far outstripping in importance the 1987
agreement to scrap medium-range weapons.
   He said a conventional arms agreement in the Vienna negotiations
is possible next year, and the Soviet Union found ``new, very
important'' elements in Bush's approach to a ban on chemical
weapons. He did not elaborate.
   ``This meeting created good preconditions for reaching concrete
results,'' the Soviet leader said.
   Gorbachev told the interviewer Bush had shown for the first time
interest in economic cooperation with the Soviet Union.
   He said Soviet officials watched carefully while Bush and his
advisers formed their policies toward the Soviet Union after last
year's election.
   Bush has now made a choice for broad cooperation with the Soviet
Union, Gorbachev said. ``I am under the impression that it is not
just a tactical move. I welcome it.''
   ``I am satisfied with the personal ties we established,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of Israeli doctors on Sunday unveiled a
laser scanner that they said can detect certain types of cancer by
examining a blood sample, eliminating the need for surgical tests.
   Doctors at Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, who began testing the
device about two weeks ago, said the Cytoscan machine is still in
an experimental stage and has an error rate of almost 5 percent.
   But they said the device, which needs only a syringe of blood
for analysis, could become part of routine testing for the
detection of early signs of cancer.
   ``It's a great breakthrough that shows promise,'' Dr. Dan
Michaeli, director of the Tel Aviv Medical Center that includes
Ichilov, told reporters.
   Dr. Samarrio Chaitchik, head of Ichilov's oncology department,
said the Cytoscan could become as common ``as a microscope in
several years.''
   He added the machine still needs to be made more accurate and
quicker.
   Chaitchik said the Cytoscan is ``too hazardous to use for
general screening'' because of its error rate and he only uses the
machine to test recovering cancer patients who are under
observation for recurrences of the disease.
   ``Maybe in the future when we feel more confident we will use it
for screening. But this is still far-fetched,'' Michaeli said. ``I
don't want the public going crazy lining up outside waiting to have
their blood tested.''
   He said researchers estimate that improved Cytoscan models would
be able to test up to 120 blood samples in one hour, but the
machine now used at Ichilov takes four to six hours to scan six
samples.
   Doctors at Ichilov have tested 700 post-surgery cancer patients
with the Cytoscan, which has shown a 95-percent success rate,
according to Michaeli.
   An additional 300 student volunteers were tested at Tel Aviv's
Bar Ilan University, where the machine was developed, and one error
was reported.
   Researchers at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital said results of the
Cytoscan's preliminary tests were not published in medical
journals, but the tests were based on well-known technologies and
showed a significant advancement in cancer research.
   Doctors using normal procedures to test for cancer take a tissue
sample, called a biopsy, which is then tested by pathologists.
   Arye Weinreb, director of the reseach team that developed the
Cytoscan, said testing with the device is far simpler and involves
no surgery.
   He said a small blood sample is taken from a patient and the
lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that helps fight disease,
are separated and placed in the Cytoscan.
   The cells are dyed and bombarded with polarized light from a
laser.
   The Cytoscan's computers track and measure the individual
reactions of thousands of different lymphocites that reveal if the
cells have been affected by cancer.
   Weinreb said the device has successfully detected cancer of the
breast, colon and lung cancer, but was not able to detect leukemia.
   Zvi Rechavi, the director of Tamam, a division of Israel
Aircraft Industries, which produces the $175,000 Cytoscans, said
two machines are currently in operation at Ichilov and Bar Ilan. He
said there are plans to produce an improved model by January 1992.
   ``The new machines will be fully automatic and sterile,''
Rechavi said. ``From the introduction of the sample into the
machine to the end of the test, the sample will not have had to be
handled.''
   Israel Aircraft Industries director Mordechai Hod said the
company is looking for a partner in the United States for joint
production.
   He said the Cytoscan was a spinoff from military research in
laser technology and reflected an effort by the company to get
involved in civilian production.

   Soldiers fatally shot a 10-year-old Palestinian
girl in the head Sunday and reportedly wounded at least 27 other
Arabs during widespread clashes triggered by mass arrests in the
occupied lands.
   The army confirmed one injury and the girl's death in the Gaza
Strip and said it was investigating the circumstances.
   Two other Palestinians died in explosions in the West Bank,
including a 12-year-old boy who picked up an unidentified object
that blew up, the army said.
   Also Sunday, two newspapers said the Palestine Liberation
Organization had approved of U.S. Middle East peace proposals after
receiving American assurances it can play a behind-the-scenes role
in negotiations.
   The upsurge in violence came as PLO-backed leaders of the
Palestinian uprising called for a ``higher stage of struggle''
against Israel to mark the second anniversary this week of the
rebellion.
   Since the start of the revolt Dec. 9, 1987, 624 Arabs have been
killed by Israelis. Another 154 have been slain by fellow Arabs who
accused them of collaborating with Israel. Forty-two Israelis have
been killed.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, hundreds of soldiers carried
out a massive search for uprising activists for a third day after
detaining suspects and killing four others Friday and Saturday.
   Israel Radio quoted high-ranking military officials as saying
more than 70 were arrested in Nablus. Earlier, army officials had
put the number at more than 30 in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   Israeli media said the sweep was the army's largest since Israel
captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The daily Maariv said about 2,000 soldiers were searching
Nablus, which has a population of more than 100,000 and has been a
major center of the uprising.
   Palestinians responded to the sweep by staging a general strike
Sunday throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Arab east Jerusalem.
   Dozens of youths burned tires and hurled rocks and bottles in
refugee camps, towns and neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip, Arab
reports said. Troops responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and
live ammunition.
   In the Shati refugee camp, 10-year-old Sabah Ahmad Balousha was
struck by a bullet in the right eye and died, the reports said.
   Nine other people were wounded at the camp, including a
4-year-old boy struck in the head by a rubber bullet, Arab reports
said.
   Among the other wounded was a 9-year-old boy struck in the arm
by live ammunition in Beit Hanoun village in Gaza, hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed the shooting of a masked protester in the
Jebaliya refugee camp. Arab reports said eight people were wounded
in Jebaliya.
   Other gunshot injuries were reported in the Bureij and Nusseirat
refugee camps and the Zeitoun, Sheikh Radwan and Rimal areas in and
around Gaza City.
   In their 49th leaflet, the uprising leaders urged Palestinians
to step up the rebellion and noted that it had led to American
dialogue with the PLO and led Israel to come up with a Middle East
peace plan.
   Israel has proposed holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as part of an interim solution for limited autonomy for the
1.7 million Palestinians in the territories.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III issued a five-point
proposal in support of an Egyptian call for preliminary talks
between Israelis and Palestinians, and Israel approved of it after
assurances the PLO would be left out of the negotiations.
   The Jerusalem Post and Haaretz newspapers Sunday said that
despite the Israeli conditions, the United States had assured the
PLO it can have a behind-the-scenes role.
   The Haaretz said Foreign Minister Moshe Arens protested news of
the reported U.S. guarantees and alleged that Israel was being
drawn into indirect talks with the PLO against its wishes.

   Israel and the Soviet Union have signed a $30
million agriculture accord that may eventually lead to a major new
market for Israeli farmers, the government said Sunday.
   Agriculture Minister Avraham Katz-Oz announced the deal when he
returned from a six-day visit to Moscow, the first such trip by an
Israeli minister in at least 22 years. He was invited by the Soviet
Academy of Sciences.
   ``I have got my shoes in the door, and now it is going to remain
open,'' he told reporters at the Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.
   Katz-Oz, of the center-left Labor Party, said he met with
members of the Supreme Soviet legislature and officials from the
Academy of Sciences and Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
   ``The Soviet Union is not concealing this visit; it wants that
to be clear. But I don't want to call it a diplomatic breakthrough.
I'm not working at the foreign ministry,'' Katz-Oz said.
   The two sides signed a $30 million agreement allowing export of
90,000 tons of fresh fruits and vegetables ``starting with potatoes
and ending with strawberries,'' to the Moscow region, Katz-Oz said.
   He said the agreement was a barter deal in which a third party
would sell Soviet goods for hard currency and transfer it to Israel.
   ``What's happening is that they have a whole list of products
they want to export, but we don't need many of these products,'' he
said.
   The Israeli agricultural products would be transferred by Soviet
cargo planes from the Ben-Gurion airport or by Soviet ships from
the southern port of Ashdod to the port of Odessa on the Black Sea,
and then by railroad to Moscow, Katz-Oz said.
   Asked by Israel's army radio when the arrangement would begin,
he said that ``if the Soviets fulfill their promise and the first
Soviet plane would land here on Dec. 23, then on Dec. 25 the
products will be there.''
   He said the agreement with the Soviet Union did not change much
for Israeli agriculture at present. However, it may eventually be
expanded to ``millions tons a year ... and then we will have to
plan, to make another program for the Israeli agriculture.''
   Katz-Oz said he also signed an agreement on youth exchanges that
would encompass about 1,000 youths ages 15 to 17 from both
countries.
   The first to come would be a group of 50 Soviet children who
have suffered radiation effects during the world's worst nuclear
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in April 1986. They will
undergo medical tests and spend two weeks in Israel's kibbutzim, or
collective settlements.
   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic ties with Israel following the
1967 Middle East war. The two countries exchanged low-level
diplomatic missions in 1987 and 1988 and are now developing
cultural and economic ties.

<HEAD>Memorial Service for Four Killed in San Francisco Crane Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 people gathered at a church in
this Seattle suburb to remember four construction workers who died
in the collapse last week of a giant crane in San Francisco.
   The four employees of Kirkland-based Erection Co. were hard
workers who cared deeply about their work and families, friends,
relatives and co-workers said at the joint memorial service
Saturday at St. Anthony's Catholic Church.
   Ironworker David Graden, 34, of Kirkland always seemed to be
smiling said a friend, Mark Whittaker. ``He wouldn't want to see
anybody grieving over his death,'' Whittaker said.
   Crane operator Lonnie Boggess, 45, of Tacoma, and ironworkers
Graden; Paul Cline, 49, of the Seattle area; and Steve Tilton, 35,
of Spanaway were killed when the crane plummeted 16 stories in San
Francisco's Financial District. A school bus driver also died and
21 people were injured.
   The investigation into the accident has focused on the
possibility of human error.
   Boggess, who had lost a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife
and admitted severe personal problems, including alcohol abuse,
were affecting his work, was recalled by a friend, Dick Jensen, as
honest and generous.
   ``He gave freely of himself, his time, his energy and his
knowledge freely,'' Jensen said.
   A friend and co-worker of Cline, Doug Glockner, said Cline
taught two of his sons the construction trade and ``was always the
first to dig into his wallet when someone came around collecting
for an injured ironworker.''
   Tilton had ``a loving, strong, healthy, old-fashioned pride'' in
his country, labor union, children and marriage, said a message
from his widow, Terry, that was read by Terry McLaughlin.
McLaughlin is the director of a Tacoma organization for victims
called Crisis Care Services.
   Tilton was buried Saturday afternoon before the memorial
service. Individual funerals for the others have yet to be held.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders named a new
government Sunday that includes non-Communists for the first time
in 21 years, but it was immediately denounced because of the large
number of holdovers from the last Cabinet.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec said the government is open to ``radical
changes,'' but opposition leaders called for a renewal of mass
street protests and threatened a general strike if the ministers
are not replaced in a week.
   Hundreds of people gathered on Prague's Wenceslas Square in the
night and urged people to rally Monday, chanting ``Everybody here
tomorrow!''
   The new government includes five non-Communists, but the other
16 members are Communists, and 13 served on the previous Cabinet.
It failed to meet opposition demands for a non-Communist interior
minister, who is in charge of police, and a civilian defense
minister.
   As he swore in the Cabinet, President Gustav Husak indicated he
may be ready to stop down, as the opposition has demanded. Husak
was installed here after the crushing of reforms in 1968, and he is
the last of those leaders still in power.
   One of the government's first acts was to propose talks with
Moscow on the future of the 80,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia
since the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the reforms 21 years
ago.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the architect of the
reforms sweeping Eastern Europe, recently criticized the invasion.
   The Cabinet holdovers include Foreign Minister Jaromir Johanes,
criticized for defending past harsh stands on human rights, and
Antonin Krumnikl, whose energy policies have been blamed for
serious pollution problems.
   The Civic Forum opposition group demanded their ouster.
   First Deputy Premier Bohumil Urban, announcing the appointments
at a news conference, said it was not possible to meet every demand.
   ``But this is what life is like. You can't take into account
everybody's demands immediately,'' he said.
   Striking students, whose protests of police brutality at a Nov.
17 demonstration sparked Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolt, laughed
in derision at their headquarters as they listened to the news on
the radio.
   The state-run news agency CTK reported that students decided
they would not return to class Monday as previously planned.
   The new government seemed a clear attempt by the Communists to
buy time to get reform going at a pace they dictate, rather than at
the rushed tempo forced by the protests of the past two weeks.
   The biggest protest occurred one week ago, when millions of
people observed calls for a two-hour general strike. After the
strike, Adamec agreed to Civic Forum demands for a new government
that would include non-Communists.
   Strike committees have been on alert since last week's protest,
and workers said Sunday they were ready to leave their jobs again.
   ``It's the only way for citizens to show what they want,'' said
Peter Miller, a worker at Prague's CKD heavy equipment
manufacturing complex. He threatened a strike Dec. 11 if a new
government is not in place in a week. Miller also demanded free
elections by July.
   Urban said Sunday the government and local administrations would
continue to be reshuffled and said new officials could be appointed
``regardless of political affiliation.''
   ``You must understand this as the start of a process,'' he
stressed.
   Jiri Dienstbier, spokesman for the Civic Forum movement, said
his group was calling another mass rally Monday at Wenceslas
Square, the focal point of the protests that toppled long-time
leader Milos Jakes and ended the Communists' 41-year monopoly on
power.
   The opposition also seeks new laws that would anchor the
democratic rights of assembly and free press and pave the way for
free elections.
   At its first meeting, the new government condemned the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of 1968, which crushed a reform
movement. It appointed Foreign Minister Johanes to negotiate with
Moscow on the future of the estimated 80,000 Soviet troops
stationed in Czechoslovakia ever since.
   The move was clearly intended to try to win sympathy for the
government from a population that was horrified by the invasion and
despised the leaders installed by Moscow afterward.
   All except Husak have since been toppled.
   ``I don't have any ambitions to remain in my function,'' CTK
quoted Husak as saying as he installed the new leaders. He said his
future would have to be discussed by all political parties and
opposition groups before he made any decision.
   The five non-Communist ministers in the new Cabinet include
three people without party affiliation and one man each from the
Socialist and People's parties. Those parties have traditionally
been docile allies of the Communists but have become more
independent in recent months as reforms sweep other East bloc
countries.
   The most interesting new appointment was that of non-party man
Josef Hromadka, a high-ranking leader of Czechoslovakia's
Protestant Church, known as Czech Brethren, who became one of seven
deputy premiers.
   Deputy Defense Minister Col.-Gen. Miroslav Vacek moved up to
take over defense, and Frantisek Pinc, a politically unknown
Communist who last served as director of a nuclear power station,
got the Interior Ministry.
   On Sunday, the heads of CTK and state radio lost their jobs,
according to CTK, as part of the wholesale reshuffling of posts now
going on.
   Premier Adamec, Foreign Minister Johanes, Communist Party chief
Karel Urbanek and Politburo member Ondrej Saling left later Sunday
for Moscow, where Warsaw Pact leaders were meeting following the
superpower summit in Malta.

   Czechoslovaks on Monday
celebrated their first unrestricted travel in decades, with
carloads crossing into the West minutes after the borders were
opened.
   ``This is an indescribable feeling,'' said Jan Spurny, 25, as he
and his brother, Dusan, drove their yellow Wartburg sedan onto
Austrian territory. They were greeted by television lights and a
small crowd of well-wishers with a sign reading ``Welcome to
Austria.''
   Minutes before, Austrian and Czechoslovak border guards shook
hands on the dividing line in a manifestation of friendship.
   The new open-border policy went into effect at midnight Sunday.
More than 100 cars had lined up at the Bratislava-Berg crossing
when the barrier was lifted four minutes past midnight.
   However, relatively light traffic was reported at some of about
20 road and rail crossings linking Czechoslovakia with Austria or
West Germany.
   The Communist government announced Thursday that all obstacles
to travel to the West would be removed. It was among the
concessions granted after weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations by
hundreds of thousands of people.
   The move came after the East German government, spurred by
similar mass protests, announced last month it was opening its
Western borders, including the Berlin Wall.
   In this country, travel regulations introduced in 1987 had made
visits to the West easier for Czechoslovaks than for most citizens
of other Soviet-bloc countries, but there were still formidable
bureaucratic obstacles.
   Before the borders opened Monday, those seeking to go West
needed a passport. They also needed authorization from the police,
from their workplace or school and in some cases from local
Communist Party officials to get an exit visa. They also had to
have invitations from relatives or friends in the West.
   Now they need only to show their passports and fill out a brief
questionnaire giving their names, addresses, the country they will
visit and the duration of their stay.
   Only one Czechoslovak soldier was on duty at the Bratislava-Berg
crossing of a two-lane road when the first Austria-bound cars
arrived about 10 p.m.
   Dusan Spurney, 22, said, ``I'm just going to drive across and
then drive right back. I just want to see if it works.''
   Jan Spurny looked at the border guard, clapping his arms across
his chest to ward off the winter chill, and said, ``He's still
packing a sub-machine gun, but now he's not likely to have to use
it.''
   Stanislav Balaz, his wife and their 14-year-old daughter were
heading for Vienna, 42 miles away. Balaz said it was their first
trip to the West since they went to Greece eight years ago.
   ``Maybe this is truly freedom,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Receives Heart-Liver-Kidney Transplant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old woman underwent what doctors
said was the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant on Sunday.
   Cindy Martin of Archbald was listed in critical condition Sunday
night, considered normal after a transplant operationn, according
to Lisa Rossi, a spokeswoman for University-Presbyterian Hospital.
   The operation began at 7:35 p.m. Saturday and ended at 5 p.m.
Sunday, Ms. Rossi said.
   Although multi-organ transplants have been done before, this was
the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, according to
transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl, director of the University of
Pittsburgh's transplant program.
   The surgery was the second heart transplant for the patient, who
has familial cardiomyopathy, an inherited heart disease, hospital
officials said.
   Since her first transplant three years ago, Ms. Martin had
suffered from chronic rejection of the heart and developed hepatits
and kidney dysfunction.
   Kidney dysfunction is a side effect sometimes present in
patients taking the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine.
   The world's first heart-liver transplant was performed on
Stormie Jones, 12, of White Settlement, Texas. Starzl conducted
that procedure on Feb. 14, 1984, at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
   Two other heart-liver transplants were performed the next year
in Pittsburgh, but both patients died with a few days of surgery.
   Multiple-organ transplants also have been performed on adults
with malignant, inoperable tumors in the pancreas and liver areas.
   In those cases, surgeons have removed the patient's liver,
pancreas, most or all of the stomach, two-thirds of the colon, and
duodenum, a 10-inch-long section of the small intestine. The cavity
has been filled with a block of organs consisting of the liver,
pancreas, duodenum and jejunum, a few feet of section of the small
intestine.

   Rebel troopers allowed 18 air force
soldiers accused in the murder of President Corazon Aquino's
husband, Benigno Aquino, to escape during the weekend coup attempt,
an air force spokesman said Monday.
   ``I believe some of the rebels who took over some facilities in
Villamor (air base) allowed them to get out and those who wanted to
get out were allowed to go,'' said Col. Melchor Rosales. Rebels
seized the base when coup bid began Friday and later gave it up.
   Rosales said 28 of the accused were held in a special detention
center inside the base. He said 18 of those were still
``unaccounted for'' Monday.
   The soldiers are among 37 people accused of conspiracy in the
Aug. 21, 1983, assassination of former Sen. Aquino, who was shot as
he arrived from self-imposed exile in the United States to lead the
opposition against the late president Ferdinand Marcos.
   Rosales said Maj. Gen. Jose De Leon ordered Villamor base
commander Col. Manuel Oxales to ``exhaust all means to retrieve''
the escapees.
   ``We feel they will be accounted for,'' Rosales said. ``This is
really a case of force majeur.''

   A fighter jet crashed Sunday while on
maneuvers over rural west Alabama, killing two Mississippi Air
National Guardsmen and igniting small forest fires, authorities
said.
   The RF4-C fighter jet crashed about 10:05 a.m. while flying with
two other aircraft from Key Field Air National Guard Base at
Meridian, Miss., said Col. David Hughley.
   The pilot, Maj. George K. Dugas, 38, of Germantown, Tenn.,
worked as a pilot for Federal Express and was taking part in
weekend training with the 186th Tactical Reconnaissance Group,
Hughley said.
   The second victim, the plane's weapons system officer, was
identified as Capt. Raymond E. Bryson, 31, of Montgomery, according
to a spokeswoman at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery.
   Hughley said the cause of the crash was unknown and an
investigation was continuing.
   Pieces of the burning wreckage ignited several small fires in a
wooded area about six miles northeast of Marion. There were no
injuries on the ground, authorities said.
   A dispatcher for Marion police said volunteer firefighters and
state forestry workers were battling the fires, which a witness
said covered a total of about 80 acres.
   Witnesses in the Sprott community said they heard a loud noise
like a sonic boom just before the crash.

   The space shuttle Discovery,
which landed in California last week after a classified flight, was
flown back to Florida on Sunday atop a modified Boeing 747, NASA
said.
   The aircraft took off from Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at
6:36 a.m. PST, according to a release from National Aeronautics and
Space Administration spokeswoman Nancy Lovato.
   The 747 stopped at Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio for
refueling, then continued to this base on the Florida Panhandle,
landing at 4:15 p.m. CST, said Kennedy Space Center spokeswoman
Lisa Malone.
   The 747 and the shuttle were to stay overnight at Eglin before
flying the final leg to the space center. Depending on the weather,
the spacecraft could be back at its home base as early as Monday
morning, Ms. Malone said.
   The shuttle landed at Edwards on Monday after high winds over
the runway kept the craft in space an extra day.
   The return to Kennedy would be the official end of Discovery's
classified mission. According to experts, the shuttle put into
orbit a 2{-ton, $300 million satellite designed to monitor military
and diplomatic communications.
   The shuttle's five-member crew also reportedly conducted tests
related to the ``Star Wars'' missile defense system during the
five-day spaceflight.

   West German leaders Sunday hailed the
resignation of East Germany's Communist leadership, with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl calling it a ``dramatic development'' in the flood of
East bloc reforms.
   Kohl spoke with reporters after a dinner meeting with President
Bush, who had just arrived in Brussels from his summit in Malta
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. On Monday, Bush is to
inform other leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
about the summit talks.
   Kohl said prospects for a closer relationship between the two
Germanys was a major topic at his meeting with Bush.
   He told reporters he and Bush discussed in detail West Germany's
10-point proposal for the eventual reunification of Germany.
   He said he emphasized that West Germany seeks progressive
improvements in relations with East Germany and the point when two
states might merge ``is completely not the issue.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said of the
latest upheaval in the East German Communist Party: ``In the
resignation of the whole leadership there has been confirmation of
what people have been saying in the street for months _ that they
have no faith in them.''
   The entire East German party Politburo and Central Committee,
including party chief Egon Krenz, resigned Sunday after weeks of
pro-democracy protests.
   While Bush dined with Kohl, Genscher had dinner with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III. Genscher will go to Moscow on Monday
afternoon to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Genscher, speaking with reporters, noted concern expressed in
both the East and West about a unification of Germany and said,
``We recognize our great responsibility for stability in Europe.''
   He said the West German government does not believe that events
in East Germany are spinning out of control.
   ``We are not concerned about this because the opposition
movement has shown itself to be very responsible,'' he said. ``When
you have hundreds of thousands of demonstrators and not a single
violent incident, this shows that the masses are calm and
responsible and acting in the best interests of democracy.''
   Genscher called the Malta summit ``a very, very positive
development'' in the effort toward European unity.

<TEXT>
   The devil is alive and well, hustling suckers in
a cheap bar on Nashville's Music Row. But he meets his match in
Billy Markham, something of a hustler himself, willing to risk
everything on the throw of the dice.
   Their contest for Billy's body and soul is recounted with
rip-snorting, raunchy delight in ``The Devil and Billy Markham,''
one half of a hilarious double bill entitled ``Oh, Hell,'' which
opened Sunday at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center.
   Shel Silverstein wrote the Billy Markham saga, and David Mamet
contributed the second part of the evening, called ``Bobby Gould in
Hell,'' which also features a highly unusual and comic Lucifer.
   Silverstein's play is a monologue, a tall tale told in verse by
actor Dennis Locorriere, a one-time member of the rock group Dr.
Hook. Looking like a refugee from the California Gold Rush,
Locorriere _ all shaggy hair and wild beard _ acts, sings and
dances his way through Billy's various bouts with the devil and God
Himself. It's a pheonomenal performance, not to mention a feat of
prodigious memorization.
   Silverstein, poet, cartoonist and author of the country hit ``A
Boy Named Sue,'' tweaks just about everybody in his short play. Its
highlight is a song about the marriage of the devil to Billy's one
true love. The celebrity list runs from Gertrude Stein to Grandma
Moses, from Caligula to Eva Braun. For Silverstein, the devil
appears to be a part of just about everybody.
   In Mamet's equally brief one-acter, the devil _ called the
interrogator _ harasses a new arrivee named Bobby Gould in an
anteroom to hell that looks like a well-appointed study. It's
complete with a spiffy leather couch and walls of books. Only when
he opens a backdoor can you hear the screams and see the smoke of
Hades.
   Bobby, played with credible anxiety by Treat Williams, keeps
insisting he was a good man. Not so, says the devil. ``You were
cruel without being interesting,'' says Satan, portrayed here by an
exasperated, almost frenzied W.H. Macy. The actor is dressed like a
walking advertising for the L.L. Bean catalog. You see, Lucifer has
been called back from a fishing trip to deal with Bobby and is
mighty upset about the interruption.
   Bobby's spurned girlfriend (Felicity Huffman) also shows up to
condemn him, and the devil has a drudge assistant, played with a
wonderful prissy rectitude by Steven Goldstein, to further browbeat
the man.
   The pingpong banter is sharp, often quite biting, and the
production is tauntly directed by Gregory Mosher who uses several
startling theatrical effects.
   ``The Devil and Billy Markham'' and ``Bobby Gould in Hell''
don't exactly celebrate Beelzebub but they recognize his effect on
what people say and do. And what they say and do, according to
Silverstein and Mamet, is very, very funny.

   ``Every heart has to be somewhere, and her heart chose El
Salvador,'' Clark said.
   He said Jennifer Jean Casolo, a 28-year-old native of Thomaston,
Ct., is deeply committed to her work in El Salvador, where she
represented an ecumenical group called Christian Educational
Seminars.
   Ms. Casolo was arrested and jailed on Nov. 26 after rebels
launched a major offensive in San Salvador. Authorities said an
arms cache including more than 20,000 rounds of rifle ammunition,
213 blocks of TNT, detonators, 106 mortar shells and other
munitions were found buried in the yard of her rented home.
   Clark said he had hoped Ms. Casolo would accept deportation
rather than stand trial, but that was not the case.
   ``She came here from choice. She stayed here from choice. She
really loves the people,'' he said. ``She doesn't want to go home.''
   Clark said Ms. Casolo is to be arraigned Monday, probably before
a military tribunal.
   Clark was retained by Ms. Casolo's family. He is not licensed to
practice law in El Salvador and said a problem will be finding a
god lawyer willing to risk defending her.
   He said ``it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible''
for her to get a fair trial given the pressure of war and the
government's belief that many foreigners aid the rebels.
   More than a dozen foreign religious workers were detained by
security forces in a crackdown ordered by the right-wing government
last month during the rebel offensive. Most were freed with the
condition they leave the country.
   But is is believed Ms. Casolo faces serious charges and will be
tried by a military tribunal because of the nature of the
accusations, Clark said.
   He said he did not know exactly what charges would be filed.
   Clark said Ms. Casolo didn't know about the munitions buried in
the yard.
   He said Ms. Casolo moved into the house in May but was absent
for long periods of time, including the entire month of September.

<HEAD>Explosives Turn Parts of Kansas Town Into Minefield</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT BEND, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of metal explosives scattered
over a wide area by a fiery blast have turned parts of this city
into a minefield, officials say.
   In the last month, Great Bend residents have found more than 30
of the explosive devices, called shaped charges, in fields and near
roads, homes, schools and businesses. No one has been hurt, but
officials worry that residents could continue to find the live
explosives for years.
   ``These are high explosives,'' said Fire Chief Dick Meisinger.
``And they are unstable now. When you're talking about an unstable
explosive, who knows what could set it off? Dropping it, kicking
it, driving over it, operating a ham radio near it?''
   The shaped charges are considered a class C explosive, the same
designation given to fireworks such as cherry bombs. Meisinger said
the explosives come in two shapes _ a small round metal ball about
the size of a cherry bomb and a larger cone-shaped explosive about
the size of a standard grenade.
   About 1,100 of the explosives, which are used in oil exploration
and recovery, were scattered over a one-square-mile area when an
explosion followed a natural gas fire Oct. 30 at Wire Tech Inc., an
oil field service company.
   Only 600 have been accounted for, Meisinger said. It is not
known how many explosives detonated in the fire.
   City fire investigators attributed the blast to leaking natural
gas that seeped from a broken gas pipe inside the building and
ignited. The explosion injured two workers, destroyed the building,
forced the evacuation of about 200 people and caused more than
$600,000 damage.
   Meisinger thinks the explosives could maim or even kill someone.
   But Kansas Fire Marshal John Earhart said that although the
shaped charges are dangerous, there is no reason to panic. He said
they probably would not explode unless someone tried to detonate
them, and they are not powerful enough to kill.
   ``I don't want to minimize the danger, because if not handled
properly they can injure people, but these may not be as dangerous
as people think,'' he said. ``I don't think they would detonate by
simply stepping on one.''

   A 12-year-old boy was charged Sunday
with fatally stabbing a 13-year-old cheerleader whose body was
discovered stashed under wood in the boy's backyard, police said.
   Kelly Brumbelow, a straight-A student at C.D. Fulkes Middle
School, where the boy also attended classes, had been stabbed
several times, said Sgt. Dan LeMay of the Round Rock Police
Department.
   The boy was arrested after his father called police about 9 a.m.
Sunday and told police he had found the girl's body under some wood
in his backyard, Cpl. David Pierce said.
   The boy was charged with murder and ordered held in the William
S. Lott Detention Center in Georgetown, and was to appear before a
juvenile court judge Monday, Pierce said. His name was withheld
because he is a minor.
   Friends of the students said Miss Brumbelow and the boy had been
neighborhood friends. Police said she visited the boy Saturday
night.
   Evidence at the crime scene indicates ``as soon as she arrived
at his residence, he attacked her and stabbed her several times in
the hall of his home and then carried her outside,'' LeMay said.
   Pierce said the father of the boy told police ``that the boy did
admit to him that he killed Kelly.''
   Police have not determined a motive, Pierce said.

   Representatives from California and Nevada have
entered into a historic agreement to seek proposals for a $4
billion superspeed train between Anaheim, Calif. and Las Vegas.
   ``The superspeed train will be our answer to gridlock'' and air
traffic congestion, California Commissioner Angie Papadakis said
during a meeting Saturday of the California-Nevada Superspeed Train
Commission.
   Once considered a futuristic dream of Las Vegas city officials,
the project moved a step closer to reality with Saturday's action.
   The plan seeks to have a train that would whisk passengers at up
to 300 miles an hour between the two cities.
   The commission agreed to send out a request for proposals Jan. 5
and has set a July 15 deadline for bidders.
   Commissioners plan to award a conditional franchise by the end
of 1990 to finance, construct and operate the system.

   Mariners were warned Sunday to steer clear of
the section of harbor where a charter fishing boat sank the day
before, killing two passengers and injuring 16 people.
   The captain of the fishing boat, 26-year-old Jack Chale, said
the 110-foot craft was in 40 feet of water ``when we hit something,
hit a submerged object. Whatever it was, I have no idea. I never
saw it.''
   All 19 people aboard the Bronx Queen were pulled from the frigid
waters within two hours of the accident reported at 3:30 p.m.
Saturday, Coast Guard officials said.
   Three of the injured remained hospitalized Sunday in stable
condition.
   The boat went down near Ambrose Light at the harbor entrance 15
miles southeast of the Verrazano Narrows, a part of New York Bay
between Staten Island and Brooklyn.
   A Coast Guard helicopter found the wreck Sunday morning, said
Lt. Craig Lloyd of the Coast Guard operations center in Boston.
Radio advisories warned ships to stay clear of the area.
   ``Our concern is that it's a hazard to navigation,'' Craig said,
adding that the Coast Guard was working with the Army Corps of
Engineers to determine what should be done.
   A man in his 50s tentatively identified as Raymond Kupczynski of
New York was pronounced dead Saturday at Peninsula General Hospital
after being brought in with a body temperature of 81 degrees and
cardiac arrest, said hospital spokeswoman Karen Perlman.
   Another man in his 50s died of hypothermia at Monmouth Medical
Center in Long Branch, N.J., said nursing supervisor Carol
Scheidler. He was not immediately identified.
   Thirteen of the injured were treated at hospitals and released.
One person escaped injury.

<HEAD>Battle Lines Drawn Over Corporate Hog Farm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KERSEY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two billionaire families more closely
identified with the boardroom than the barnyard are facing off over
construction of one of the most technologically advanced hog farms
in the United States.
   The Bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, are building a hog and
cattle farm along the banks of the South Platte River in
northeastern Colorado's Weld County that plans to raise 300,000
pigs and 10,000 cattle a year.
   ``This is something very unique,'' says Jack Schneider, effluent
manager for the hog farm. ``It has its own ecosystem, utilizing as
much nitrogen as possible to go back into grass production, so we
can raise cattle.''
   But downstream are the 32,000-acre Eagle's Nest Ranch with 700
head of cattle owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz, owner of
Southern Pacific Transportation Co., and the 760-acre Windbreak
Ranch owned by beer magnate Peter H. Coors of Adolph Coors Co.
   They claim that National Hog Farms, which is building the new
farm, is trying experimental farm techniques and if the experiment
fails, it could pollute their land.
   The farm plans to use no antibiotics or other drugs on the
animals, which are commonly used elsewhere. It also plans to spray
waste water on the land to fertilize native grasses, which in turn
would feed cattle.
   Coors and Anschutz are financially backing environmentalists who
oppose the operation, and have filed lawsuits in a yet-unsuccessful
attempt to block it.
   Weld County Commissioner Gene Brantner calls it a duel between
billionaires that the county wants no part of.
   ``Let them go down to the courts to decide who is right or
wrong,'' said Brantner, whose family helped settle the county and
is featured in James Michener's novel ``Centennial.''
   The issues involved _ land and water _ are as old as Colorado,
and important in a region that receives only 15 inches of
precipitation annually.
   Also at stake are 200 jobs provided by the new hog farm, a
crucial factor in an economy that has been hit hard the past few
years by declines in the oil industry and land values.
   The farm, scheduled for completion in 1992, would have its own
weather station and sewage treatment plant. Trucks entering the
farm will be disinfected and workers will be required to shower and
change into sterile clothes before entering. Grown hogs will be
transported to neighboring states for slaughter.
   ``They're on the leading edge, doing things that haven't been
done in other places,'' said Schneider. ``I can't say 100 percent
sure something won't go wrong, but if it does, it will be minimal.''
   Financial backers include investor Robert Bass, whose wealth has
been estimated by Forbes magazine at $1.44 billion; Sid Richardson
Bass and Lee Marshall Bass, who are valued at an estimated $1.25
billion; and Edward Perry Bass, at $1 billion. They made their
money in oil, gas and farming.
   Anschutz has a net worth of $1.2 billion and Coors owns or
controls properties worth further millions. Both have refused to
comment publicly on the battle, preferring to work through
environmental groups and the courts.
   They're worried about the 2.2 million gallons of waste water the
farm will generate each day and the 24-hour holding capacity in the
sewage tanks. The concern is that if those tanks fail or break
down, the wastes could wind up in the wells from which the Anschutz
and Coors ranches pump their drinking water.
   They're also afraid the hog farm will harm the pheasants and
geese they like to hunt on their property, the fish they catch in
their private ponds, and the nearby Riverside reservoir, a refuge
for geese and pelicans.
   They point to the National Hog Farms operation in Atkinson,
Neb., which has been sued five times for air pollution, water
pollution and allegedly causing pseudo-rabies, resulting in a
quarantine of that farm's hogs.
   Coors and Anschutz are financially backing an organization
called Protect Our Water, which has started a petition drive to
regulate what they say was an unforeseen development in American
farming.
   Schneider admits some of the farming techniques are
experimental, but says the theories are sound.
   The farm has built 16 monitoring wells to check for ground water
contamination. The weather station will have solar panels to
monitor irrigation to match water usage. The hog units will be air
conditioned and hermetically sealed to keep out disease, while
refrigerated trucks will dispose of dead animals.
   Robert Stovell, who manages the Eagle Nest Ranch for Anschutz,
said National Hog Farms also tried experimental techniques in
Nebraska and some of those failed.
   Schneider acknowledged there have been problems in Nebraska,
most stemming from the use of lagoon drainage for wastes. He said
the company learned a lot from those mistakes and corrected the
problems in the new operation.
   Stovell acknowledged that the South Platte River, a main focus
of the current battle, already is polluted, partly from cattle
operations farther upstream.
   ``We're not totally opposed to the company in this case. If they
set up adequate handling facilities, that's fine,'' Stovell said.
   Stovell said he will continue his petition drive and lawsuits
against the operation, although he hasn't had much luck because the
facility meets county regulations.
   Stovell said stricter regulations don't exist because no one
foresaw scientific corporate farms like this. He wants county
regulations changed to control the amount of wastes that can be
released.

<HEAD>Brach's Bid To Use Foreign Sugar Leaves Bad Taste Among Competitors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.J. Brach &amp; Sons Inc., caterer to America's
sweet tooth for 85 years, wants to make its candy with foreign
sugar, which is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of competitors
who must use more costly domestic supplies.
   Brach's bid carries a heavy threat: If the Commerce Department
doesn't allow it to buy foreign sugar, the Illinois company says it
may close its aging factory in a poor Chicago neighborhood, taking
3,500 jobs elsewhere.
   But if Brach wins, candy makers claim it will have a remarkable
advantage over the rest of the industry, because sugar from abroad
sells for about a dime less per pound than domestic versions,
resulting in an annual savings to Brach of about $20 million.
   A public comment period on Brach's proposal was to expire Nov.
21, but the issue has left other candy makers so sour the Commerce
Department extended the period to the end of the year.
   ``The essential issue here is one of fairness,'' Nestle Foods
Corp. of Purchase, N.Y., said in a letter to the Commerce
Department's Foreign-Trade Zones Board.
   ``If Brach's application is granted, applications from other
similarly situated manufacturers should receive equal treatment,''
Nestle said.
   Other competitors of Brach, which is owned by Jacobs Suchard
Ltd. of Switzerland, let their emotions spill.
   ``We find this request for special status by a foreign-owned
company to be insulting,'' said Joel Inc. of Elizabethtown, Pa.,
parent of Pennsylvania's Simon Candy Co. ``They already own the
lion-share of the market, and now they seek the aid of the
Department of Commerce in running the rest of us out of business.''
   ``Lousy management of Brach,'' wrote Powell's Fine Candies Inc.
of Hopkins, Minn., ``should not be subsidized by actions of our
government or its agencies.''
   Brach President Ron Habijanac countered: ``It's not a sugar
issue, it's a social issue. This is 3,500 jobs. We've got a cost
problem.''
   The government is very protective of the domestic sugar
industry. It will allow only 2.49 million tons of raw sugar into
the United States between Jan. 1, 1989 and Sept. 30, 1990.
   By comparison, the Agriculture Department predicts U.S. planters
will produce 7 million tons during the fiscal year that began Oct.
1.
   Acting on Brach's behalf, the Illinois International Port
District filed an application with the Foreign-Trade Zones Board on
Sept. 26 requesting that Brach's factory be designated a
``foreign-trade subzone,'' which would exempt the company from
quota restriction on foreign sugar.
   The request will be decided by the Foreign-Trade Zones Board,
which is comprised of Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Army Secretary Richard L.
Armitage.
   A special committee is investigating the issues in the case, and
a decision by the board is not expected for several months.
   The lobbying, however, has begun.
   Mosbacher has received letters of support from Illinois Gov.
James R. Thompson, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Illinois Sens.
Alan Dixon and Paul Simon, and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful
Chicago Democrat who is the chief tax-writer in the House.
   ``I am enough of a realist to know how tall an order this is for
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board. The history of proposals for sugar
operations ... is familiar to both of us,'' Rostenkowski told
Mosbacher.
   ``You might be advised to reject the idea out of hand; I hope
you will resist that advice,'' he wrote.
   The Teamsters union, which represents Brach workers, also
supports the company's position.
   The Brach tradition in Chicago is as rich as its chocolate.
   In 1904, German immigrant Emil Brach invested his life savings
in a small store and called it Brach's Palace of Sweets. That store
grew into the huge factory on Chicago's West Side, where tons of
chocolate, Starlight Mints, jelly candies and licorice items are
produced each week.
   Three years ago, Brach was sold to Jacobs Suchard an
international food conglomerate flush with cash.
   Brach's critics say Jacobs Suchard knew the risks of acquiring
an antiquated factory with a large work force when it paid hundreds
of millions of dollars for the company.
   ``Look, what we bought was an excellent brand name in the United
States,'' Habijanac said in an interview from Chicago. ``You always
have surprises. When you buy a company you understand there are
challenges.''

   The United States, Japan and West Germany _
the world's largest trading nations _ all showed a big increase in
the value of their exports during the first half of this year
compared with 1988, the International Monetary Fund reported Sunday.
   West Germany's exports increased from $159.1 billion to $169.1
billion; the United States' rose from $157.6 billion to $182.7
billion; and Japan's went up from $125.3 billion to $135 billion,
the IMF said.
   At the same time, West German imports rose from $124.1 billion
to $132.7 billion and U.S. imports went from $224.6 billion to
$241.5 billion. Japan's imports dropped slightly, from $91.5
billion to $91.1 billion, the IMF said.
   The U.S. trade deficit improved in the first six months to $58.8
billion, down from $67.1 the year before.
   Japan's surplus of exports over imports increased nearly
one-third, to $43.9 billion from $33.7 billion. West Germany's
surplus increased to $37.2 billion from $34.9 billion.
   Increased deficits were reported for Britain, $23.3 billion,
instead of $21.1 billion; Italy, $10.3 billion, up from $6.8
billion; and France, $8.4 billion, up from $5.8 billion.
   Total trade of 22 industrial countries rose to $2.1647 trillion
from $2.0097 trillion for the six months.
   The fund reported a drop in inflation among industrial countries
in the summer quarter of the year, July to September. Prices paid
by their consumers rose at an annual 4.5 percent rate against 4.8
percent in the spring quarter.
   Third World countries, slower in their reporting, showed a
slight drop in the annual rate for the April to June quarter: 62.7
percent instead of 63.8 percent. These figures vary widely from
country to country: Brazil's annual rate was 846.5 percent and
Mexico's 18.4 percent, while more prosperous countries in Asia had
much lower rates, such as South Korea`s 5.7 percent.
   The fund also noted a strengthening of the dollar in October.
Compared with other major currencies, it was worth 4.42 percent
more than in October 1988. In the same period, the Japanese yen
dropped by 9.95 percent, the British pound by 7.96 percent and the
Swiss franc by 4.26 percent.
   The West German mark and French franc showed small increases.

   The only woman indicted in the sweeping commodity
fraud probe of Chicago's futures exchanges has become the 15th
person to plead guilty in the investigation.
   Melanie Kosar, 26, of suburban La Grange, appeared Friday before
U.S. District Judge James Zagel, entering guilty pleas on one
charge each of mail fraud and violating the Commodity Exchange Act.
   She followed John Myskowski as the second trader from the
Chicago Board of Trade bond pit to plead guilty. She is the 15th to
enter a guilty plea out of the 48 indicted in an FBI undercover
investigation of trading at the BOT and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Two people have yet to be arraigned.
   Ms. Kosar pleaded guilty to reduced charges in return for her
testimony against another BOT trader in the U.S. Treasury bond pit,
Howard Goberstein, and for her cooperation in the continuing probe,
officials said.
   Ms. Kosar faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a
$350,000 fine. Sentencing is to be set after the trial of
Goberstein.
   Ms. Kosar's plea agreement indicates that she participated in
illegal trades with bond traders who have yet to draw indictments
from the inquiry. It says she illegally pre-arranged trades on two
occasions, including one in which an undercover FBI agent served as
an intermediary and collected a fee for the service.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Buyer To Move Headquarters to Philadelphia, Change Pennwalt
Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French company that bought Pennwalt
Corp. in October plans to make Philadelphia the headquarters for
its North American chemical operations, but Pennwalt will lose its
name in the process.
   Atochem S.A., the international chemical arm of Societe
Nationale Elf Aquitaine, said that next month it would combine its
three U.S. chemical businesses, including Philadelphia-based
Pennwalt, and call the new subsidiary Atochem North America.
   The subsidiary will generate annual sales of $1.5 billion a year
and employ about 5,000, company officials said Friday.
   ``I believe this is a very positive and exciting step for
Atochem,'' Jacques Puechal, who oversees Atochem's global
operations, told employees.
   ``It is good news for Philadelphia to become the home base of a
larger entity. Pennwalt has played an important role in the
business, civic and cultural life of the city.''
   Before the meeting, Puechal said Atochem was consolidating
operations to ease internal communication among three businesses
and to better serve customers.
   Philadelphia was chosen as the headquarters site because
Pennwalt represented the largest of the company's three North
American operations and would involve displacing the least amount
of workers, he said.
   As part of the aquisition agreement, Pennwalt was supposed to
keep its name, which the 139-year-old company traces to its
original name of Pennsylvania Salt Co.
   Seymour S. Preston III, who has been Pennwalt's president and
chief operating officer and who will head the reorganized business
in the same capacity, told employees that he and other members of
the planning committee had ``spent substantial time and effort and
emotion'' wrestling with the name change.
   The committee chose Atochem North America because the name
offers the greatest recognition worldwide for the business, he said.
   Absent from the new lineup of executives was Edwin E. Tuttle,
who has led Pennwalt as chairman and chief executive officer for 11
years. He said he would be vice chairman of the new firm until it
got in its feet and would then retire.
   In all, about 75 positions will be eliminated from the
companies, Preston said, but the consolidation will bring to
Philadelphia area at least 150 new jobs, officials said. Most of
the jobs will be located at Pennwalt's headquarters. About 450
employees work there now.
   Preston said the company would look for ways for the new company
to become more efficient. He did not rule out further reductions in
employment but said that might be achieved through attrition.

<HEAD>Milkman Once Again Makes Home Deliveries</HEAD>

   Local businessman Don Tomaso is milking a
combination of nostalgia and convenience by offering suburbanites a
taste of what life was like when dairy products were home-delivered
in glass bottles.
   Thousands of suburban families are returning to days of old when
milk was left on the front porch.
   Tomaso, his wife, Shirley, and their two sons started a home
milk delivery business last spring, using direct mail advertising
to pitch their product.
   ``We've been wildly successful, far beyond our wildest
expectations,'' the Wisconsin businessman said.
   Tomaso's wife estimated the family has close to 1,000 customers
in Chicago's northern suburbs, who have milk in glass bottles,
other dairy products and even fresh-squeezed orange juice placed in
blue boxes on their porches.
   Tomaso buys his products from Oberweis Dairy in Aurora, which
has four other vendors delivering milk in suburban Cook and DuPage
counties.
   ``Home milk delivery kind of died out for a long period of time,
but it's coming back, particularly to the double-income families
that like the convenience of having milk delivered,'' said Elaine
Oberweis, president of Oberweis Dairy.
   Oberweis hung in while other small dairies and home deliverers
succumbed to competition from supermarkets, government price
controls and the growth of the soft-drink industry, Mrs. Oberweis
said.
   The company plans to expand home delivery after years of
dropping sales, she said.
   The milk-delivery companies say they can operate at a healthy
profit. Each vendor seems to have his own system: Some sell the
products at store prices but add a service charge of $1 for each
delivery, while others charge 10 cents to 75 cents more per product.
   Tomaso said nostalgia might be a factor in the milkman's return,
but other factors come into play as well.
   ``Part of the nostalia trip would be to be out there with a
horse, but nostalgia only goes so far,'' he said. ``It has to taste
good, too.''
   Convenience appears to be a top reason for most customers.
   Frank and Patricia Turkot moved to Wheaton from New York's Long
Island about six years ago and said their four children, who
consume about five gallons of milk each week, made milk buying a
continuous chore.
   ``This is a lot more convenient,'' Mrs. Turkot said of the milk
delivery service. She added that she thinks the milk tastes better,
too.
   ``I don't know what it is,'' she said. ``I guess it's that the
cardboard has a funny taste, and with the glass bottles, you don't
get that.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Gives Resounding Rejection to Private Ownership</HEAD>

   China's Communist Party has issued a resounding
rejection of private ownership, saying public ownership has become
``an irreversible trend.''
   In a ringing endorsement of orthodox Marxist ideology, the party
newspaper People's Daily lambasted the most cherished of capitalist
principles.
   ``Can `paradise' be found in capitalist countries? Absolutely
not,'' the paper said in a lengthy commentary Saturday.
   ``Political regimes that are based on privatized economies breed
all forms of corruption,'' the People's Daily said. ``The innate
character of the bourgeois dictatorship of capitalist private
ownership is a dictatorship of the rich minority over a poor
majority.''
   In 1848 Karl Marx summarized the theory of communism in a single
phrase: ``eradicating private ownership,'' the People's Daily said.
   ``For half a century, many countries under the leadership of
communist parties have established the great struggle of public
ownership to wipe out privatization, and this has become an
irreversible historical trend,'' it said.
   China's Communist Party stepped up its calls to adhere to strict
Marxist doctrine and reject ``bourgeois liberalism,'' or Western
ideas, following the short-lived pro-democracy movement this spring.
   The student-led movement sought political reforms but widened to
call for increased freedoms including better education, a less
controlled economy and higher wages.
   After the movement was violently crushed by the Chinese army,
leaving hundreds dead, top leaders orchestrated a return to
doctrinaire slogans, ordering the mass media to follow the
Communist Party line and selectively report positive news.
Government leaders have also rejected political pluralism and have
continued to crackdown on political dissent.
   The paper said those who support private ownership claim that
Chinese yearn to leave the country for overseas, even agreeing to
be ``third-rate citizens'' of other nations.
   ``This is pure rumor,'' People's Daily said. ``Most Chinese
people studying or working abroad love their homeland.''
   Thousands of Chinese overseas, however, do seek ways to remain
abroad rather than return to China, where they face low-paying jobs
which they may not be able to choose, and drab living conditions.
   U.S. diplomats in Beijing say that more than 90 percent of
Chinese who go to study in the United States do not come back.
