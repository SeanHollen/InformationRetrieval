   James K. Batten, chief executive officer
and board chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., has been named the 1990
winner of the William Allen White Foundation Award for Journalistic
Merit.
   Batten is to receive the citation and deliver the annual William
Allen White Day address Feb. 8 at the University of Kansas. The
award is named for the late editor of the Emporia Gazette.
   A panel of White Foundation trustees chose Batten to receive the
citation, which is given annually to a journalist who mirrors White
in ``service to profession and country.''
   ``Not only was William Allen White a small town newspaper editor
in Emporia, Kan., but he was also a distinguished newspaperman with
a national reputation,'' said Bill Meyer, foundation president and
editor of the Marion County (Kan.) Record. ``Jim Batten is also a
distinguished newspaperman with national acclaim, deserving of this
award.''
   Batten, 53, directs an international news operation that
publishes 29 daily newspapers. He oversees the company's business
news and information services, cable television operations and
newsprint production. Batten also is a director of The Associated
Press.

<HEAD>Defense Study Finds West Would Be Warned Well In Advance Of Soviet
Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet-bloc forces likely would require so
much preparation to attack Western Europe that U.S. intelligence
would detect the activity months in advance, according to a report
published Wednesday.
   A study prepared for Defense Secretary Richard Cheney said the
``intelligence community believes we would have some 33 to 44 days
of warning time,'' and possibly six months, The Washington Post
said in its Wednesday editions.
   The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the report by
unidentified officials. The judgment on warning time was said to be
shared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA and the Defense
Intelligence Agency.
   NATO war plans had been based on the assumption that the West
would have just 10 to 14 days' warning of an attack, the newsaper
said.
   A short expected warning time led to decisions to invest large
sums in airlift capability and forward storage of ammunition and
supplies.
   The study said that while it remained possible for the Soviets
to launch a quick attack that would allow the West less than two
weeks' warning, such a move would be ``quite risky'' for the
Soviets.
   The study also found that during the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
of Czechoslovakia, Moscow was so worried about possible
intervention from the West that it put its battlefield nuclear
rockets on 10-minute alert, even though ``Moscow clearly wanted to
avoid a general war in Europe.''

<TEXT>
   Americans marveled at the towering statue of
Ramses II in an exhibit of artifacts from the mighty pharaoh's
reign, but now it appears the colossus is a retouched image of
someone else.
   New research indicates the statue was of a lesser-known pharaoh
who ruled 600 years before Ramses the Great was born. Experts say
it became Ramses because he had his artisans retouch the face and
inscribe his name.
   They also say the ancients would have been worshipping both
god-kings when they made offerings to the 24-foot statue of red
granite, which weighs 47 tons.
   No one doubted the statue was of Ramses when, in 1987, it was
pulled from its grave of mud and weeds in Memphis, the ancient
Egyptian capital.
   So positive were promoters that it was given a royal sendoff
from the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. A band played the
national anthem and boat sirens blared a 20-minute farewell salute.
   With American help, the statue was restored at Memphis State
University in Tennessee. Then it joined other Ramses artifacts
already being exhibited to complete a hugely successful nationwide
tour of U.S. museums.
   First at Memphis, then in Denver, Boston, Charlotte, N.C., and
Dallas, the colossus stole the show.
   But it isn't Ramses, says art historian Hourig Sourouzian, who
has spent years studying Ramses statues.
   ``It's Sesostris I,'' she said. ``Ramses touched it up, made it
more his style and put his name on it.
   ``Of course, when Ramses did this, the statue became Ramses. No
problem. But when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus,
they were remembering not only Ramses, but Sesostris.''
   Sesostris I also was called ``the Great'' and died in 1926 B.C.
He was a pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom, while Ramses was of the New
Kingdom, ruling for 67 years in the 13th century B.C.
   Ms. Sourouzian said a major problem in identifying large
Egyptian statues is that ``Ramses had so many of them, and his name
was so famous, that any oversized statue naturally was assumed to
have been his.''
   Nevertheless, she said, ``something disturbed me even then''
when she first saw the colossus in the mud of Egypt.
   ``The next time I saw it was on exhibit'' in Memphis, Tenn., she
said. ``It was beautifully restored, beautifully lighted, but when
I took a deep look, I said, `It's not Ramses.'''
   Rita Freed, who led the restoration team for the Institute of
Egyptian Art and Archaeology at Memphis State, said she first heard
of the Sourouzian research a year ago.
   ``It's excellent. I think she's right,'' Ms. Freed said by
telephone from the Boston Museum, where she now works.
   ``I didn't think anything about it until we brought the statue
to Tennessee,'' she said. ``Once we had it standing, I said, `Gee,
that looks Middle Kingdom,' but I must emphasize it's Ramses. His
name is on it and we've done a wonderful job of saving a
magnificent statue.''
   It is no secret that Ramses had a fondness for gigantic statues
of himself. He erected them throughout Egypt.
   Some depict him standing, some sitting. The largest, estimated
to have stood 57 feet and weighed 1,000 tons, lies headless in his
ruined mortuary temple, the Ramesseum.
   Perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at Abu
Simbel, southern Egypt.
   Ms. Sourouzian said she discovered Ramses the Great borrowed
colossal statues in his customary grand style. She reported finding
nine Sesostris I retreads.
   Both pharaohs had connections with Memphis, now Mit Rahina
village, 17 miles south of Cairo. Memphis contained several
colossi, including one of Ramses now in Cairo's Ramses Square.
   Another of him remains at Mit Rahina, on display where it fell.
A twin of the colossus that toured America, also a made-over
Sesostris, is in pieces at the Mit Rahina outdoor museum, Ms.
Sourouzian said.
   Discovering what is or is not the Ramses look hasn't been easy
for the Armenian-born scholr, who is a doctoral candidate at the
Sorbonne in Paris and co-author of the official catalogue of
Cairo's Egyptian Museum.
   Relics of Ramses and his family are everywhere in Egypt. He had
at least three queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to
have fathered 167 children.
   About 300 statues of Ramses have survived, and Ms. Sourouzian
has used her artist's eye to examine them: clothing, expression,
muscles, size of the legs, items in each hand, the crown.
   Statues of Sesostris' era had one look, those of Ramses' another.
   ``In earlier times, statues showed fierceness because the
pharaohs were trying to show they could smite their enemies,'' Ms.
Sourouzian said. ``Ramses, who truly was great, could have
portrayed himself on statues this way, but he preferred a faint
smile, a gentleness.
   ``A Ramses statue has a sweet expression. He has massive legs
and wears a longer kilt. He has a triangular or round face with
almost almond-shaped eyes, looking down. He wears a uraeus on his
crown,'' an ornamental cobra favored by New Kingdom pharaohs.
   The nine colossi that Ramses recycled are backed by stone slabs
and have straight mouths, rectangular faces, thick cheeks and eyes
staring straight ahead. The kilts are short.
   Despite Ms. Sourouzian's research, the identity of the colossus
scheduled to arrive home from America on Dec. 6 is not in question,
said Egyptian antiquities official Zahi Hawass.
   ``When the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient
Memhis, the name we'll put under it is Ramses II,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The last words anyone heard The
Rev. Ignacio Martin-Baro say were: ``What an injustice. What
carnage.''
   A few minutes later, he and five Jesuit colleagues were shot
down. The killers seemed determined to leave no witnesses. The cook
and her teen-age daughter were slaughtered too.
   But someone survived the bloodbath Nov. 16 at Jose Simeon Canas
Central American University: a cleaning woman named Lucia Barrera
de Cerna.
   In sworn testimony the judge made available Monday to The
Associated Press, Mrs. Barrera, 44, said the killers wore military
uniforms.
   Until Monday, only sketchy second-hand accounts were available
of her testimony about the killings that stunned El Salvador and
caused an international outcry.
   ``I don't discount any possibility; it's probably members of the
military,'' said Ricardo A. Zamorra, the investigating judge who
took her statement Nov. 22 at the Spanish Embassy, where the woman
hid until fleeing to Miami last week under the protection of U.S.
officials.
   Mrs. Barrera said she was awakened by gunfire at about 1 a.m.
and ran to a window. In ``moonlight that was like daytime,'' she
reported seeing five uniformed men close in, shooting, on the
residence the six Jesuits shared across the way.
   Two assailants wore camouflage, she said, like the uniforms ``I
have seen on the soldiers in the street,'' and the others were clad
in dark uniforms.
   She heard doors flung open and more shots, then ``voices,
without being able to distinguish who spoke at first. Only the
voice of Padre Nachito (Martin-Baro) was I finally able to hear. He
was saying: `What an injustice. What carnage.'''
   After an outburst of gunfire, ``Padre Nachito spoke no more, nor
could I hear a single voice,'' she said.
   A few seconds later, Mrs. Barrera heard furniture crashing and
glass breaking. She said she left the window and rushed to tell her
husband what she had seen, ``crying for what I imagined might have
happened, because I couldn't hear the padre.''
   A few minutes later she heard an explosion, then another.
   ``After the explosions ... I heard no footsteps, no sound,
nothing that told me where they had gone. It seemed as though they
had fallen from the sky.''
   When dawn came, the terrified woman said, she emerged and found
the bodies of four priests, including Martin-Baro, vice-rector of
the university, and the Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, the rector,
sprawled on the lawn with their faces destroyed. The others were
inside the residence, which was ransacked and pocked by bullets.
   The head of the Society of Jesus in Central America, the Rev.
Jose Maria Tojeida, said later he could hear shooting for at least
20 minutes.
   Reporters later said that hundreds of empty assault-rifle
cartridges littered the area.
   Judge Zamorra, a close friend of one of the victims, The Rev.
Segundo Montes, 56-year-old head of the university's human rights
institute, said circumstantial evidence also pointed to the
military.
   ``It's logical because of the time,'' he said.
   Zamorra said autopsies indicated the eight victims died at about
2 a.m.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed four days earlier and,
according to Jesuit officials, there was a virtual military cordon
around the campus.
   Soldiers had searched the residence the day before the killings.
The Jesuits had been the targets of threats, bombs and public
denunciations by rightists who considered their liberal theology
akin to communism.
   ``I'm confident we'll find the masterminds because the
government has decided to pursue this to the end,'' Zamorra said.
   The massacre prompted fears that right-wing death squads had
been turned loose in El Salvador as leftist rebels conducted their
biggest offensive of the decade-old war, and President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government is under intense pressure to
resolve the case.
   Judge Zamorra said he must sort through records of fingerprints,
ballistics evidence, footprints and the results of a five-hour
autopsy session that was repeated after sniper fire interrupted it.
   ``We're confident we'll find the fingerprints of the guilty,''
he said. ``We have faith that God will help us. We'll follow it to
the end.''
   The judge was educated by Jesuits and teaches at the university.

   Doctors implanted part of a woman's liver in her
21-month-old daughter Monday and predicted the nation's first
living-donor liver transplant would be a success.
   ``We're quite confident that this organ will work,'' said Dr.
Christoph Broelsch, who led the surgical team in the 14-hour
operation at University of Chicago Medical Center.
   Teresa Smith and her daughter, Alyssa, were in critical
condition in intensive care and doing well, officials said. Alyssa
came out of surgery about 9:10 p.m., about five hours after her
mother's operation ended.
   Broelsch said doctors would get some indication over the next 24
hours on how the liver is functioning.
   In three to five days they will know if the surgical wounds are
healing properly, and in a week they should get an indication of
whether the liver segment is being rejected by the body.
   The liver was already starting to work, producing bile, as
doctors were finishing the operation, Broelsch said.
   ``She's in as good a shape as any child we see'' at this stage
after a transplant, he said.
   The surgery is the first liver transplant from a living donor in
this country, doctors at the hospital said.
   Broelsch said the most difficult moment came when Mrs. Smith's
spleen was damaged during her surgery and doctors had to remove it.
   ``We didn't expect that at all, but we had it under control in
two or three minutes,'' Broelsch said. ``In no way at any point was
the mother's life in danger.''
   The surgery was the first liver transplant from a living donor
in this country, according to doctors at the university hospital.
   Alyssa went through a critical period of about a half-hour
without a liver very well before the segment was sutured into place
shortly before 6 p.m., Ernst said.
   Doctors then had to flush preserving fluid out of the organ
segment. They planned to make sure it was beginning to work
properly before reconnecting blood vessels and bile ducts, Ernst
said.
   Mrs. Smith was out of surgery at 4 p.m., more than seven hours
after entering surgery. She was listed in critical condition in an
intensive care unit, but is expected to be fine, the spokesman said.
   ``She's fine, a little hurting, she has some pain,'' said her
husband, John L. Smith, who visited her after the surgery.
   People can live without their spleens, although it may make them
more susceptible to infection, Ernst said.
   If successful, the operation could provide a solution to a
severe shortage of organs for children who need transplants, said
doctors at the hospital.
   More than 700 babies a year in the United States need liver
transplants, and as many as half die for lack of a donor.
   Alyssa suffers from an often-fatal liver disorder called biliary
atresia, the leading cause for liver transplants involving children.
   She had been waiting more than a year for a cadaver liver
transplant when the Smiths heard about the hospital's plans for an
experimental living-donor program in August. Liver transplants from
living donors have been performed only three times _ in Brazil,
Australia and Japan. One child has died.
   Mrs. Smith went into surgery at 7:35 a.m. to begin the operation
in which the left lobe of her liver _ about one-third of the organ
_ would be transplanted in her daughter.
   ``She was as eager to get started as she was a month ago when we
first proposed this to her,'' said hospital spokeswoman Mary
Fetsch. ``She has not displayed any signs of doubt or hesitation.''
   Broelsch led the surgical team in the two-phase operation. About
3{ hours into the mother's operation, doctors prepared Alyssa for
the transplant.
   Monday's surgery was complicated by the need to keep the removed
portion of the liver intact, he said. But he noted the hospital's
doctors had been transplanting portions of cadaver livers into
children since 1984, ``with better than 80 percent success.''
   A medical ethicist said using a parent as donor raises some
serious questions.
   Given the ``extraordinary pressure that any parent would feel
... to do anything possible to help the life of their child, would
the emotional attachment ... interfere with being able ... to fully
understand the benefits and risks of the operation?'' researcher
Reinhard Priester said Monday from the University of Minnesota's
Center for Biomedical Ethics.
   Mrs. Smith had no doubts.
   ``Once you've given someone a big piece of your heart, it's easy
to throw in a little bit of liver,'' said the 29-year-old
schoolteacher from Schertz, Texas, before Monday's surgery.
   A medical ethics team worked closely with doctors in preparing
the family for the operation, Ernst said.
   ``In a way I kind of fear for her, but I'm confident everything
will turn out OK,'' said John Smith, an assistant shipping
supervisor who was at the hospital with the couple's 3-year-old
son, Richard.
   The Chicago hospital has spent more than a year planning the
program, and last August authorized 20 such operations to determine
whether the procedure is viable.
   Until now, the only regularly performed living-donor transplants
have involved kidneys and some pancreas segments.

<TEXT>
   Chief Frank Fools Crow, a widely respected
Sioux Indian spiritual leader who traveled with the Buffalo Bill
Cody Wild West Show as a young man, died Monday at the home of his
grandchildren.
   Fools Crow was born just south of the Porcupine district of the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. His exact age was not known, but he
was believed to be 99.
   In an interview earlier this year, Fools Crow said he quit
school in the third grade to work to help his family earn a living.
As he grew to manhood, he said, he traveled throughout the nation
with the Cody wild west show.
   The chief said he followed ``vision quests'' that directed him
into a life of healing and tribal leadership. He saw alcoholism and
jealousy as the greatest curses for Indian people.
   In an interview with The Rapid City Journal in February, Fools
Crow said he realized the world was changing, but modern problems
must be dealt with through cooperation and without losing sight of
the old ways.
   ``We need peace and understanding and unity of all young men,
young women and elders _ both Indian and non-Indian alike,'' Fools
Crow said. ``We must all stand together and work together for the
reason of peace and tranquility of life for all.''
   Fools Crow, a medicine man and spiritual grandfather, had lived
with grandchildren in a trailer home near Kyle after the death of
his second wife, Kate, in October 1988. His first wife, Fannie
Afraid of Hawk, died in 1954. Services are pending with the
Osheim-Catron Funeral Home in Rapid City.
   Fools Crow said respect, generosity, courage, knowledge and
wisdom were keys to the survival of the Lakota culture.
   ``These values start from the home. They are taught there and
expressed there and carried into the world,'' he said. ``You must
first better understand yourself before you can express yourself to
others. The Lakota values help you do this.''
   Thomas E. Mails, an artist and ethnologist who has produced four
major studies on North American Indians, wrote the holy man's
biography, titled ``Fools Crow.''

   The editors of a Nevada cookbook claim it's
down-home, but some of the recipes came from the White House _
although the Bushes' Mexican Mound isn't exactly the haute cuisine
one expects at state dinners.
   The Country Cookbook by the Nevada Farm Bureau Women's Committee
consists mainly of Nevadans' recipes dating from the 1880s, and
includes instructions from an Indian chief on how to roast a
groundhog.
   But editor Chris Shuey solicited President Bush, former
President Reagan and their wives for some of their favorites to
give the publication national flavor.
   Mrs. Shuey, who lives on an alfalfa farm in central Nevada, said
she hadn't tried the recipes the First Families sent.
   ``We didn't have a test kitchen,'' she explained. ``I hope
they're good, but I probably shouldn't say that.''
   The Bushes also submitted recipes for American clam chowder,
vegetable salad and apple crisp in orange juice.
   Their Mexican Mound dish has corn chips, ground meat, taco
seasoning, cheese, onions, olives, tomato, sour cream, lettuce and
avocado dip piled high on plates and served buffet style, first
lady Barbara Bush said.
   Nancy Reagan's recipes included chocolate brownies, piccata of
veal and cool cucumber soup. Reagan sent a recipe for a cold
Spanish soup.
   Chief Frank Temoke Sr., of Elko County, submitted the method for
roasting squirrel and groundhog. It calls for dressing the animal
and pinning it together to avoid getting ashes in the opening.
   ``Make a hot fire and singe all the hair off so that it's
smooth,'' the chief explained. ``Dig a hole in the coals with a
shovel and put the squirrels in; leave this way for about two
hours. To eat, peel off the skin.''

<TEXT>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority paid $172,700
to fly a manager between his Tennessee office and his Virginia home
for a year because officials believed the man would otherwise quit,
a congressional report says.
   The study, released Monday by the General Accounting Office, a
research agency of Congress, said the authority provided the
flights for Steven A. White between Oct. 2, 1987, and Sept. 30,
1988, while he was the TVA's nuclear power manager.
   White had been hired when the authority's management was being
criticized by Congress, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
others.
   ``TVA's board of directors ... believed that the special
transportation services were necessary to retain Mr. White's
management services,'' the GAO wrote.
   White lived in Charlottesville, Va., and worked in the TVA
office in Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance of more than 400 miles. He
left the agency Nov. 18, 1988.
   White, a retired admiral who served in the Navy's nuclear
submarine program, was hired as a consultant by the TVA in January
1986 when the authority was facing severe problems with its nuclear
power program. The previous fall, the TVA shut down its five
operating reactors and halted construction on 12 others.
   The flights were made primarily on Friday evenings and Monday
mornings so White could spend weekends at home, the report said.
   ``We found no evidence that TVA provided similar commuting
services to its employees or to contractors,'' the investigators
wrote.
   White's wife accompanied him on three of the flights, using
government-paid seats, the report said.
   TVA spokesman William Lee in Knoxville, Tenn., said he could not
comment on the report because the authority had not seen it. White
did not return a telephone message left at his Charlottesville home.
   Until October 1987, White flew to work on commercial airlines
and was reimbursed by the TVA. The study did not say how much White
billed the authority for the trips.
   The report stated that from Oct. 2, 1987, to March 18, 1988, the
TVA provided air transportation for White through a contract with
Bechtel, one of the authority's construction subcontractors.
   Small numbers of other TVA and Bechtel workers also flew on some
of these flights, but ``the flights were geared to meet the needs
of Mr. White's schedule,'' the report said.
   Under their contract, the TVA paid for four of the eight seats
on each flight. White was a passenger on 34 of the 39 flights,
which ended when the TVA decided the arrangement was not
economical. The service cost the TVA $108,400, the report said.
   During the next six months, the TVA used its own aircraft or
chartered planes for White. During that period, White made 23
flights between his home and office at a cost to the TVA of $64,300.

   President Bush will protest to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their weekend summit against
the ``outrageous behavior'' of Moscow's Central American allies,
but also will be prepared to discuss deeper troop cutbacks in
Europe, officials say.
   The subject of Central America was assured a more prominent
place in Bush's talks with Gorbachev on Saturday and Sunday after
the discovery of a shipment of surface-to-air missiles reportedly
sent by Soviet-backed Nicaragua to leftist guerrillas in El
Salvador.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler on Monday called
the arms shipment a ``dangerous escalation of conflict'' in El
Salvador.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``will
press the Soviets to take action to ensure that their allies cease
this outrageous behavior.''
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet on warships in the Mediterranean
off the coast of Malta primarily to talk about the rapid pace of
change in Eastern Europe as hard-line communist regimes are
collapsing.
   Fitzwater said Bush has been studying ``a wide range of military
options'' involving troop levels in preparation for his meeting
with Gorbachev and in planning for a scaled-down defense budget he
will submit to Congress next year.
   ``The president will have in his mind all of the options that
are available to him,'' Fitzwater said. ``The president wants to be
in a position to discuss the situation with the Soviet leader, to
be responsive and to be in a position to then go to our allies and
say, `Here's what our discussion produced, here are his ideas, here
are my ideas, now where do we think we might want to go.'''
   After two days of talks with Gorbachev, Bush will fly to
Brussels, Belgium, to brief NATO allies next Monday.
   In May, the allies approved Bush's proposal to reduce U.S. and
Soviet troop levels in Europe to 275,000 on each side _ requiring a
300,000-person cutback in Soviet forces and a 30,000 reduction in
U.S. troops.
   Fitzwater said Bush and Gorbachev would talk about arms control
and military force structure. ``Those discussions will bear on
future decisions about changes in our own military posture.''
   He said reductions in Soviet forces beyond the level proposed by
Bush would enhance stability, reduce the risk of war and be
welcomed by the United States.
   ``It is only logical that substantial further reductions in
Soviet forces would lead to changes in NATO's military posture,''
Fitzwater said. However, he said any changes would have to take
place within the structure of the Vienna-based talks on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``Any actions that we would suggest or recommend would only be
with the approval of our allies,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, the State Department said the United States had
lodged a formal protest with the Soviet Union at the embassy in
Washington over the missiles that turned up in El Salvador.
   There were 24 SA-7 missiles and 21 rounds for a Soviet-designed
mortar aboard a Cessna aircraft that crashed in eastern El
Salvador, the State Department said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze had promised
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in September that the Soviets
had stopped direct weapons shipments to Nicaragua. Baker said at
the time he did not challenge that assertion.
   But the State Department has said since then that Soviet bloc
weaponry continues to pour into Nicaragua, some of it after
shipment through Cuba or Nicaragua.
   Fitzwater said, ``Despite Soviet promises to use their influence
for peace in Central America, it is clear the Sandinistas and their
Marxist allies continue to destabilize the legitimate democracies
of the region.''
   Privately, U.S. officials said Monday the Soviets may be having
trouble restraining Managua and Havana from supporting the leftist
rebels.

<HEAD>`Solar Max' Satellite Heading Back to Earth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Say goodbye to Solar Max, the satellite that
got a heart transplant in space and lived for another five years
studying the sun. The $77 million space probe is dead and coming
back to Earth _ maybe in pieces.
   ``We expect it to come down on Dec. 2, plus or minus 24 hours,''
Capt. Thomas Niemann of the U.S. Space Command in Colorado said
Monday.
   Solar Max has been getting scientific information from the sun
for nearly 10 years, covering almost one complete solar cycle. But
its fuel ran out and it is no longer possible to keep it out of the
clutch of Earth's atmosphere.
   ``It is clinically dead,'' said Randee Exler of the Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland. Even its death taught engineers
something. They wanted to see if the solar panels would jettison on
command after all this time in the chill of space. They did.
   The satellite is tumbling near the edge of the atmosphere, which
is becoming increasingly dense. When the 5,000-pound spacecraft is
finally captured and plunges through the atmosphere, it will be
mostly destroyed by fire, but some larger pieces may survive and
fall in chunks to Earth.
   The chance of any large piece falling on anyone is remote. Most
of the satellite's path is over water, although it travels across
South America, Africa, India, Australia and the southernmost tip of
China. South Florida and the extreme southern part of Texas and
Hawaii are the only U.S. areas along the track.
   Solar Max was launched in February 1980. When three of its seven
instruments failed, experts thought enough of the satellite to send
a space shuttle crew to repair it. In 1984, they pulled next to
Solar Max, brought it into the cargo bay, fixed it, and sent it on
its way _ the first time such a feat had been attempted in space.
   A month later, in May 1984, Solar Max recorded one of the
largest flare eruptions ever seen on the sun.
   Other achievements in Solar Max's career:
   _In 1987, its gamma ray spectrometer was the first instrument to
detect rays from Supernova 1987a, a distant star that exploded in a
neighboring galaxy, the Magellanic Cloud.
   _It detected 10 comets colliding with the sun, the latest on
Sept. 28.
   _Its ultraviolet spectrometer detected small increases in
high-altitude ozone levels around Earth just north of the equator;
and also decreases just south of the equator.
   _It recorded more than 12,500 solar flares _ powerful eruptions
on the sun, and made it possible for scientists to measure sunspot
magnetic fields above the visible surface of the sun for the first
time.
   NASA said it will miss Solar Max, but that its sun science
program will continue. A solar observatory is scheduled for launch
in 1995, an orbiting solar laboratory in 1996, and a U.S. soft
X-ray telescope will be on the Japanese Solar-A satellite scheduled
for launch in 1991.

<HEAD>House Lawmakers Hit Justice Department Over Controller Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers who say they uncovered fraud during
an investigation of the firings of Chicago air traffic controllers
are criticizing the Justice Department for shifting the case to
another agency.
   ``It is your department's responsibility to investigate and
prosecute perjury or obstruction of justice violations _ not the
responsibility of the inspector general,'' Rep. Glenn M. Anderson,
D-Calif., said in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Anderson, chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee, questioned the decision to ``buck the matter'' to the
Transportation Department's inspector general.
   In September, the committee's investigations panel released a
report that said aviation officials lied and created evidence to
support the firings of hundreds of Chicago controllers during the
1981 strike.
   A government appeals board, citing attendance records, upheld
the firings in 1985.
   However, the investigations subcommittee said FAA officials had
set up a ``war room'' at the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control
Center in Aurora, Ill., and created records to replace original,
shoddy documents.
   ``The committee feels very strongly that witnesses who give
perjured testimony during a congressional investigative hearing
should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' Anderson
told Thornburgh. ``It would be astonishing to learn that the
Justice Department does not share this belief.''
   A Justice Department official said Monday that the case was not
closed.
   ``They want more information to see which way to go,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There are a lot of
options.''
   During their probe, lawmakers were not judging the merits of the
nationwide strike, which left about 450 Chicago controllers out of
work. Rather, they said they were concerned with the actions of FAA
officials who were defending the firings before the Merit Systems
Protection Board.
   The letter also was signed by Reps. Guy V. Molinari of New York,
the senior Republican on the investigations and oversight
subcommittee, and James L. Oberstar, D-Minn., who led the
investigation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent researchers should be given access
to secret government files on worker exposure to radiation at
federal nuclear weapons plants, says an advisory panel to Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins.
   The recommendation, if accepted by Watkins, would mean a
historic shift in the government's stance on public access to
medical and radiation exposure records dating to the start of
American nuclear weapons production in the 1940s.
   The advisory panel of nine health and legal experts said in an
interim report to Watkins late last week that dropping the Energy
Department's long-standing ban on public access to the data would
help restore the department's sagging credibility.
   Watkins on Monday welcomed the report but did not say whether he
would accept the recommendation, which was among several aimed at
improving the department's health research activities.
   ``This is a highly qualified group of professionals,'' Watkins
said in a prepared statement. ``Their ideas are very much in line
with my own impressions of what we need to do to strengthen this
important research activity.''
   Watkins' statement said he instructed the department's acting
energy research chief, James Decker, to prepare a plan by Dec. 15
``for making those changes that can be implemented'' on the basis
of the advisory group's recommendations.
   Watkins assembled the group in August to advise him on ways to
restructure the department's health research program. Some members
of Congress are pressing for legislation to move the research
responsibility to another government agency, such as the Department
of Health and Human Services.
   The department for years has fought a Pennsylvania group, the
Three Mile Island Public Health Fund, over access to the medical
records, which are the most detailed collection of data on health
effects of long-term exposure to radiation.
   Daniel Berger, an attorney for the Pennsylvania group, said
Monday ``we're cautiously optimistic'' that Watkins will heed the
advisory panel's recommendation, which was based on more than two
months of study of the department's health research programs.
   ``It could be a major milestone in our quest for the data,''
Berger said in a telephone interview.
   The information includes death records and the historical
exposure to radiation of about 300,000 people who have worked at
the government's nuclear weapons plants and laboratories in 12
states over the past four decades.
   Government researchers under contract to the Energy Department
have published numerous studies based on the disputed data, but
independent researchers, without access to the material, have been
unable to form their own interpretations.
   The advisory group's report said Watkins should ``adopt a policy
of maximum possible openness with regard to the release of data to
the Three Mile Island Fund research workers.''
   The group said only two limitations should be placed on access
to the data by independent researchers: none of the workers'
identities should be disclosed, and the department should be
allowed to withhold files being analyzed for studies planned for
publication _ until they actually are published.
   The advisory group also recommended Watkins begin immediately to
secure agreements with states to provide for the release of death
certificates so that information derived from the certificates can
be made available to independent researchers.
   The group said it had come to no conclusion on whether the
department's epidemiological research activities should be
transferred to another government agency.
   The advisory panel is due to submit a final report to Watkins
next year.

<HEAD>Vietnam War Hero's Ashes Scattered at Sea by Namesake Ship</HEAD>

   The Navy frigate named after Vietnam War hero
Lt. Cmdr. Wilmer Paul Cook performed a solemn mission, scattering
its namesake's ashes at sea 22 years after the combat pilot died in
battle.
   The USS Cook left port Monday morning and paused off the coast
for the 20-minute service before resuming maneuvers, said Navy
spokesman Cmdr. David Dillon.
   It was believed to be the first time a Navy ship was involved in
the sea burial of its namesake, Dillon said.
   Cook, a highly decorated A-4 Skyhawk pilot, was shot down three
days before Christmas 1967 while leading an air strike over North
Vietnam. He was listed as missing for more than 20 years before his
remains were returned to the United States last year and later
identified.
   ``It's nice that he came home finally. It's nice that he's back
in the United States. That's all I care about really,'' said his
eldest son, Wilmer Paul Cook Jr. ``It eased my mind to know where
he is exactly. For years, I didn't know whether he was alive or
dead.''
   Cook, 31, and his younger brother, John Cook, 26; and their
uncle, John M. Cook Jr., 65, of Titusville, N.J., attended a
portside memorial service aboard the frigate on Friday.
   The family requested his remains be scattered at sea from the
ship that bears his name.
   ``I wanted him to be remembered by the ship and the people who
make it go,'' the elder son said.
   ``It's a rare occasion for a ship and its crew to be able to
honor the man for whom the ship is named, and to commend the
remains to the deep,'' the frigate's Cmdr. Richard Kalb said at
Friday's memorial.
   Hospital Corpsman 1st Class James Gorham, who attended Monday's
service on behalf of the family before returning to San Diego by
helicopter, said the ship was brought to a stop and the crew of 250
mustered to pay their final respects.
   Navy Chaplain James Sharrett led a prayer and read from the
Bible as the ship's executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Steven Bostwick,
scattered the ashes into the Pacific.
   A seven-member honor guard fired three volleys into a clear sky
to salute the dead pilot and Taps was played to conclude the
service.
   The USS Cook was commissioned in 1971 in New Orleans. It was
named after Cook, who was 35 when he died, because of his valor,
Dillon said.
   ``Navy frigates like this are traditionally named after military
heroes,'' he said.
   Cook, a native of Annapolis, Md., and a 1956 Naval Academy
graduate, became an aviator in 1957. His carrier-based squadron was
sent to Vietnam in 1965.
   He flew more than 300 missions in his Skyhawk, named the ``City
of Annapolis,'' during two tours to the Tonkin Gulf on the carriers
Constellation and Coral Sea.
   Among his commendations were three Distiguished Flying Crosses
and five Air Medals for aerial combat. He was considered an expert
in the Skyhawk and had been urged to return stateside to train
others but felt he was needed more on the frontline.
   On the day he was shot down, the Navy said, he had turned down
shore duty to lead the fateful air strike.
   ``I'll always go where my country sends me and will always do
whatever it asks,'' Cook once wrote in a letter to his parents.
``Perhaps what I am doing may keep my two sons from going to war.''

<HEAD>Afghan Resistance Leader Says Soviets Still Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S.-backed Afghan resistance
says he wants America to supply high-altitude anti-aircraft weapons
for use against Soviet bombers he says are flying against his
forces from Soviet territory.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, who met with President Bush at the White
House on Monday, also said he hopes Bush will tell Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit next weekend to drop his
support for the ``puppet regime and the communist government'' in
the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   ``Unfortunately, the free world thinks that the Russians have
withdrawn completely from Afghanistan,'' Mojaddedi told The
Associated Press in an interview after his meeting with Bush.
   ``Still, the Russians are bombing our people, the mujahedeen
(guerrillas), from their own territory,'' he said, speaking very
formal but very clear English.
   ``I told President Bush that we must be strong in the military
field or no political solution will come,'' said Mojaddedi, who is
the president of the Afghan Interim Government. The government was
formed in exile in Peshawar, Pakistan, as the Soviets withdrew the
last of their 115,000 troops from Afghanistan last February.
   Bush and Mojaddedi did not talk about the summit, the Afghan
leader said, adding, ``it is up to him whether he discusses it with
Gorbachev or not. I think that President Bush probably will speak
to Gorbachev about the Afghanistan issue because it is a very
important international matter.''
   The Afghan leader said that during the White House meeting, Bush
``promised us his support and assistance.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement
that Bush ``reaffirmed our support for the Afghan resistance's
efforts to achieve self-determination and also expressed U.S.
interest in a political settlement.''
   He said Bush ``called upon the Afghan Interim Government to
continue and increase its efforts to fashion a stable, broadly
based government responsive to the needs of the Afghan people.''
   Mojaddedi said deliveries of U.S. weapons to the mujahedeen
guerrillas of Afghanistan resumed two months ago, after a break of
eight months.
   ``There was a gap. We do not know what the reason was. We
suffered from that. We hope that it will not happen next time,'' he
said.
   ``Two months ago, (deliveries) resumed. The commanders of the
mujahedeen have been more effective these two months. They have
achieved great progress in many areas, and have captured a number
of strategic posts and many weapons, and even tanks from the
enemy,'' said Mojaddedi.
   ``The biggest need of the mujahedeen now is weapons to use
against the air force, which bombs from a very high altitude,'' he
said.
   ``Up till now, we have not asked'' for high-altitude
anti-aircraft weapons, he said. Before his delegation leaves on
Friday, he said, ``we want to ask ... We are asking for all kinds
of weapons.''
   Despite the Red Army withdrawal, the Soviets have greatly
increased their military aid to Kabul, sending between $300 million
and $400 million a month in arms, according to U.S. intelligence
estimates.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, at his meeting in
September with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
complained of the high level of Soviet military aid.
   But the Soviets responded that the United States, by sending the
guerrillas a reported $500 million in arms annually via Pakistan,
was violating the Geneva accord that secured the Red Army
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   If the Soviets are, as charged by Mojaddedi, flying bombing
missions against the anti-communist mujahedeen guerrillas, it also
would appear to violate the Geneva accords.
   Mojaddedi's accusation was echoed in a letter to Bush from 17
congressmen released Monday.
   ``Shortages of weapons have emboldened the Soviets. We have also
received what we believe to be reliable accounts of Soviet planes
coming across the border to attack the resistance. At the very
least, these reports need to be carefully and thoroughly
investigated,'' said the letter, circulated by Reps. Robert
Lagomarsino, R-Cal., and Don Ritter, R-Pa.

<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Discovery
streaked out of orbit and landed safely Monday in the setting sun
at this Mojave Desert air base, ending a secret military mission
extended an extra day and then an extra orbit by high winds.
   Air Force Col. Frederick Gregory, commander of the five-person
crew, guided the winged spaceplane to a touchdown on a concrete
runway at 4:30 p.m. PST after a five-day flight that covered nearly
2 million miles.
   ``With the sun glinting off the underside of the vehicle, it was
really a pretty landing,'' said NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato.
   The orbiter touched down to the strains of the national anthem
wafting from loudspeakers across the desert to an applauding crowd
of about two dozen NASA observers.
   Immediately after the touchdown, NASA workers began preparing
for the crew to exit from Discovery. Darkness fell quickly, leaving
the orbiter illuminated by powerful searchlights on the desert
runway.
   An hour after touchdown the crew was driven away in a van to
undergo medical exams, then three hours later reappeared to address
about 60 friends and NASA workers gathered on a cold airplane ramp
outside a hangar.
   Gregory did not explain why he came out wearing a salmon-colored
slipper on his right foot and a brown shoe on the left.
   ``One of the things that you learn when you go in space is that
you don't have to wear the same kind of shoes when you come out,''
he said.
   Lovato said she did not know why he wore a slipper.
   Speaking of a few things that had not worked right, the
commander recalled that on his first shuttle mission the toilet
aboard the shuttle Challenger had broken.
   ``And lo and behold, the first thing that broke on Discovery
this time was the bathroom but we fixed it very quickly,'' he said.
   He did not specify what else hadn't worked.
   The extra day in space was spent ``relaxing and taking
pictures,'' he said.
   The crew then took off around 9 p.m. PST in NASA jets for the
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Two sonic booms cracked overhead as Discovery descended through
a clear sky and made its sweeping approach to runway 04. Forty-five
minutes before touchdown, controllers directed Gregory to shift to
runway 04 from the hard clay of runway 17 because of more favorable
winds.
   The rays of the setting sun shone brilliantly off the shuttle as
it made its final approach to a centerline touchdown.
   The shuttle landed in light crosswinds of 4 mph and a headwind
of about 19 mph, ending the 5-day, 6-minute and 46-second mission
in the pink streaks of a setting sun.
   Mission Control lifted its curtain of silence on the flight to
report 80 minutes before landing that Gregory had successfully
fired two braking rockets to drop the shuttle out of orbit and
start it on a fiery plunge through the atmosphere.
   ``The propulsion officer and the crew confirm that the burn was
good,'' control center commentator Billie Deason reported after the
3-minute, 4-second rocket ignition.
   The five-day flight reportedly put in orbit a satellite to
monitor military communications over a wide area of the globe.
   Although as many as half a million people have flocked to this
desert air base to watch previous shuttles land, Monday's touchdown
was closed to the public because the mission was classified.
   Winds gusting to 30 mph forced NASA to call off a landing
attempt here on Sunday. The winds were not as strong Monday, but
were high enough at times at more than 15 mph to make conditions
unacceptable for a planned landing at 2:52 p.m.
   With prospects looking better for the follow-on orbit,
controllers directed the astronauts to stay aloft another 89
minutes. As predicted, the winds subsided and NASA gave the
astronauts the go-ahead to fire the braking rockets.
   The delay Sunday shifted the touchdown from nighttime to
daylight, during which landing rules are less stringent. A shuttle
is not allowed to land at night if crosswinds exceed 12 mph. The
figure rises to 17 mph in daytime.
   It was the sixth time in 32 shuttle missions that a return to
Earth has been postponed by bad weather.
   The delay posed no threat to the astronauts because they had
enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit until Wednesday if
necessary. NASA also has other landing sites at White Sands, N.M.,
and at Cape Canaveral but prefers the long, wide-open runways at
Edwards.
   Discovery's other crew members are pilot John Blaha and mission
specialists Manley Carter Jr., Story Musgrave and Kathryn Thornton.
   In announcing the landing delay, Mission Control said that the
shuttle and its crew ``continued to be in excellent condition.'' A
Pentagon-imposed news blackout that affected most of the mission
kept the space agency from discussing the astronauts' reaction to
the delay.
   However, sources close to the project have said the astronauts
achieved their main goal Thursday, the second day of the flight,
when they released a 2{-ton, $300 million satellite designed to
listen in on military and diplomatic communications in the Soviet
Union, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
   The crew also reportedly conducted experiments related to the
``Star Wars'' missile defense system. It was believed the
astronauts also performed research into how people can serve as
military observers in space.
   As Discovery was ending its Thanksgiving mission, sister ship
Columbia was being readied at Cape Canaveral for a 10-day Christmas
mission during which five astronauts are to deploy a Navy
communications satellite and retrieve a scientific satellite that
has been orbiting the Earth for nearly six years.
   Columbia was scheduled to be transported to a launch pad Tuesday.

<HEAD>Ag Spending Reduced by $1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture spending is being reduced by more
than $1 billion during this fiscal year under an agreement reached
by Congress to help lower the federal deficit.
   After weeks of negotiations, the House and Senate agreed to the
savings last week, just before recessing for the year. The fiscal
year began Oct. 1.
   The cuts are part of the massive bill, known as budget
reconciliation, that includes $14.7 billion in savings from all
departments of the federal government.
   ``The agriculture measures included in the reconciliation
conference report were the ones that we feel will achieve the
required savings in a fair and equitable manner with minimal
disruption of farm program objectives,'' said Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.
   A $235 million savings comes from reducing deficiency payments
for 1990 crops by:
   _2.33 cents per bushel for wheat.
   _2.33 cents per bushel for corn.
   _0.515 cents per pound for upland cotton.
   _5.15 cents per hundredweight for rice.
   Another $54 million is expected to be saved through repayment of
advance deficiency payments for 1988 crops of wheat, feed grain,
upland cotton and rice.
   However, those repayments would not be required before Dec. 31
if the producer suffered 1988 or 1989 crop losses because of a
natural disaster, or before July 31, 1990, for the portion of the
crop covered by the 1988 Disaster Assistance Act.
   About $116 million will be saved from the soybean, sunflower and
safflower planting program and the feed grain limitations program.
   That section requires the agriculture secretary to offer farmers
the chance to plant soybeans, sunflowers or safflowers during 1990,
similar to the provisions of the 1988 disaster aid act.
   Other savings include:
   _$143 million through reduction of Export Enhancement Program
and Targeted Export Assistance payments.
   _$500 million through purchases of Financial Assistance Corp.
stock by Farm Credit System Institutions.
   _$27 million through adjustments in dairy price support
programs, including setting the purchase price for price support
purposes for butter at no more than $1.10 per pound. It also makes
the 50 cents per hundredweight decrease in milk price supports
discretionary for 1990.
   _$25 million by altering the way the agriculture secretary
allocated butter and non-fat dry milk powder purchases between
April 1 and July 1, 1989.

chemical companies to stop selling foreign countries pesticides
that are banned in the United States.
   ``In addition to protecting public health, the export of
dangerous pesticides creates a competitive inequity between foreign
and American farmers and growers,'' Wilson said at a news
conference Monday.
   He said U.S. growers were required to use what often are more
expensive pesticides to meet federal regulations against dangerous
chemicals, while foreign growers can use the less expensive
products that have been banned in the United States.
   Wilson, who is running for governor of California, introduced
federal legislation late last week that would stop U.S. companies
from exporting pesticides banned here.
   A spokeswoman from the Western Growers Association, in Irvine,
Calif., said competition from foreign growers is a big problem for
California farmers and will be a key issue in the gubernatorial
campaign.
   ``We've been letting Sen. Wilson know that we are under extreme
pressure from foreign farmers,'' said Barbara Buck, adding that
California farmers are experiencing ever-increasing costs of doing
business.
   ``Meanwhile, farmers in other countries are able to pay far less
in wages, have cheaper land, get chemicals very cheaply and can use
whatever they want in most cases,'' Buck said.
   ``In the frozen side of the business, there have been a lot of
broccoli, asparagus and cauliflower growers who have gone out of
business because they can't compete with the frozen vegetable
production in Mexico.
   ``In 1988, the value of all fresh produce imported to the United
States had risen to $602 million from $379 million in 1980,'' Buck
said, adding that the number of separate food products grew from 27
in 1980 to 40 in 1988.

   The Agriculture Department's new yearbook is
designed to help farmers be better managers.
   The 336-page book, ``Farm Management: How to Achieve Your
Business Goals,'' offers practical information from university and
extension experts, says editor Deborah Takiff Smith.
   More than 80 authors contributed to this year's edition,
focusing on individual farmers making decisions on the use of land,
labor, capital and managerial skills. A different topic is selected
each year.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, a Nebraska farmer, said
management is one of the reasons U.S. agriculture is so competitive
on the international market.
   ``Only talented managers can succeed in today's tough business
environment, where our farmers must face not only the competition
of their neighbors, but often that of the government treasuries of
other nations,'' Yeutter said in the foreward of the book released
Monday.
   The USDA yearbook officially began in 1894, although annual
volumes of reports were issued in the 1840s, when federal
agriculture was under the Commissioner of Patents.
   Annual reports were continued after the USDA was created in
1862, according to agency historical accounts. Copies of the
reports were distributed by Congress, a tradition that continues
today.
   Smith said 211,800 copies of the 1989 yearbook are being
provided to Congress, with each senator getting about 350 books and
each member of the House about 400.
   Constituents may obtain free copies of the yearbook from
senators and members of Congress, she said. The books may be
ordered for $10 from: Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C.
20402. The yearbooks also will be sold at government bookstores in
many cities.

   Federal health officials are conducting a
criminal investigation into alleged scams involving ``rigging'' of
cholesterol screening devices to produce higher than normal
results, officials said.
   The intent is to make referrals to physicians for follow-up
testing, said Richard Kusserow, inspector general of the Department
of Health and Human Services, and Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Wyden, chairman of the House Small Business subcommittee on
regulations and business opportunities, said Monday that his panel
had ``uncovered evidence that mass cholesterol testing has been
used by unscrupulous entrepreneurs to capture patients with rigged
negative results.''
   The results, he said, ``then are used to sell customers
additional, unneeded and expensive medical tests and services.''
   Wyden declined to discuss the investigation further, calling it
``a sensitive legal matter.''
   Kusserow, in an interview after testifying before Wyden's
subcommittee, said his office was investigating ``several scams''
that involved referral of Medicare and Medicaid recipients for
unnecessary tests.
   It is illegal to bill those federal programs for services that
are not needed, he said.
   ``We have very few isolated cases of that, but they are
instances where these people have crossed the line,'' he said.
   During the hearing, Kusserow and Wyden both expressed concern
that increasing public interest in cholesterol testing has created
a new money-making opportunity for entrepreneurs who care more
about profits than public safety.
   Screenings are popping up regularly in shopping malls, store
fronts, pharmacies, health clubs and other public settings.
Kusserow estimated that at least 10 million people had their blood
cholesterol tested this way in 1988.
   Often, the screenings are used by private companies and
entrepreneurs as a marketing strategy for products that claim to
reduce cholesterol and by stores to increase traffic and sales,
Kusserow said.
   The inspector general said a study conducted by his office, at
Wyden's request, found extensive problems with quality control and
proper hygiene at these screenings.
   Among the problems, he said, were testers who were not properly
trained to operate cholesterol-measuring devices or to draw blood
in a way that assures a true reading. Testers also often failed to
wear gloves, and those who did often did not change them.
   Such disregard for proper hygiene poses the risk of infection,
both for testers and those being tested, from blood-borne diseases,
including AIDS and hepatitis, Kusserow said.

   Despite a nervous Park Service lift operator,
first lady Barbara Bush managed to get close enough to the National
Christmas Tree to crown it with a white plastic star.
   In front of the press corps and preschool playmates of her
3{-year-old granddaughter, Marshall Bush, Mrs. Bush took a bumpy
ride in a hydraulic lift to the top of the 35-foot tree where she
used a silver pole to place the star.
   When the ride down was briefly halted, Marshall called out
cheerfully, but insistently, ``Hey, when are we going down? Get me
down here!''
   Back on the ground, Mrs. Bush took Marshall to pose for a
picture with lift operator Kevin Guard.
   ``I thought she was coming over to chew me out,'' Guard said
later. ``She just said thanks.''
   Guard, 35, was pressed into service when the Park Service found
itself with a rented lift but no operator.
   ``I was scared to death,'' he said. ``I'm in trees _ trim them,
cut them down, make them safe.''
   Asked how he wound up with the job of hoisting the first lady,
Guard said:
   ``It just happened. I usually drive a cherry picker. They didn't
have an operator, so I did it.''
   The tree, a Colorado Blue Spruce from a farm in York, Pa., will
be adorned with a 1,000 more white stars _ representing President
Bush's ``Thousand Points of Light'' _ and several thousand red and
blue lights during the next two weeks.
   Bush will throw the switch to light the tree Dec. 14.

   Actor Dennis Weaver likes his house of old
cans, tires and other garbage, despite the zingers it inspired from
comedian Jay Leno.
   Neighbors have taken to calling the home ``the Michelin
Mansion,'' in honor of the 2,200 old tires used in the walls. The
house features solar heating and cooling and contains 40,000 cans
packed into its 3-foot-thick walls.
   Leno recently asked Weaver on the ``Tonight Show'' if neighbors
of the Rocky Mountain abode think he is adding on a room when he
puts out the trash.
   ``And when the garbage man comes, how does he know where the
garbage begins and the house ends?'' Leno asked.
   But Weaver, the horseback riding TV detective ``McCloud'' and
the whining deputy of ``Gunsmoke,'' said his vision for the future
is embodied in the house.
   ``If we get into the mind-set of saving rather than wasting and
utilize other materials, we can save the Earth,'' he said.

   U.S. publishers are giving a Bogota newspaper
that was bombed because of its coverage of Colombia's drug trade a
helping hand in its effort to prevent bankruptcy.
   Thomas C. Fichter of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association, one of two trade associations coordinating a drive to
raise funds for El Espectador, said Monday the newspaper should
receive the initial loan installment this week.
   El Espectador has said it needs $2.5 million to continue
publishing; Fichter said $1.6 million had been contributed or
pledged to aid the newspaper.
   The president of El Espectador, Luis Cano, toured the United
States in October seeking support from news organizations. A car
bomb that exploded near the newspaper's offices Sept. 2 did $2.5
million worth of damage, he said.
   Cano's younger brother, Guillermo Cano, publisher of the paper,
was killed by drug traffickers in 1986. Two newspaper employees in
Medellin, where the drug cartel has its headquarters, were killed
in October.
   Fichter said ANPA is working with the Inter-American Press
Association of Miami in coordinating the fund-raising campaign. He
said money or pledges had been received from about 50 donors in the
United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.

   The Senate Ethics Committee is changing its

and allegations of wrongdoing related to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
   The committee said Monday that it had hired former federal
prosecutor Henry Schuelke to replace Robert Bennett.
   Bennett, who will continue to handle two other cases for the
committee, told the panel last week that his law firm's diverse
practice could lead to an appearance of conflict of interest in the
D'Amato case. Details of how such an appearance could arise were
not given.
   Mark Green, D'Amato's 1986 election opponent, filed a complaint
with the committee accusing him of breaking Senate rules in the
Reagan-era problems at HUD. D'Amato has denied any improprieties.
   Schuelke will help the committee determine whether to proceed
with a formal investigation.
   Bennett is still the committee's outside counsel conducting a
similar review in a case involving five senators who interceded
with banking regulators on behalf of a contributor whose savings
and loan was collapsing.
   Bennett also is the committee's counsel in an investigation of a
book deal by Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn.

<HEAD>For East German Jews: A Time Of Hope And Fear</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For East Germany's Jews, the democratic
change battering the Communist government stirs new hopes and old
fears.
   ``I feel fearful when people get up and say, `Hang the
Communists,' because when it starts with the Communists it always
ends with the Jews,'' said economist and writer Irene Runge, a
prominent member of East Germany's tiny Jewish community.
   ``When newspapers say disaster threatens because Poles and other
foreigners are smuggling, this to me has the sound of the Nazis.''
   The crumbling of the Berlin Wall, however, has raised hopes that
the East German government will finally pay reparations to Jewish
victims of the Nazi Holocaust and to Israel, and hand over billions
of dollars worth of Jewish-owned buildings in East Berlin seized by
the Nazis.
   East Germany's decision Nov. 9 to let its 16.5 million citizens
travel freely also means that the isolated East German Jews _ 400
officially registered and some 4,000 others _ can have regular
contact with the approximately 37,500 Jews in West Germany and West
Berlin.
   Before World War II, the German Jewish population totalled
560,000.
   East and West German Jews will celebrate the festival of
Hanukkah jointly next month for the first time since the wall went
up in 1961.
   And years of tortuous negotiations with the government for
concessions such as allowing a young Jew to visit Israel or attend
a West German Jewish student conference are no longer necessary.
   Earlier this month, the president of the East German Jewish
Community, Dr. Peter Kirchner, wrote to the new East German
premier, Hans Modrow, urging the establishment of diplomatic
relations with Israel.
   He also wants a pledge to suppress any neo-fascist party that
might arise and to include in the school curriculum special courses
on the Holocaust and Judaism.
   ``There is no doubt that many things will ease,'' Kirchner, a
55-year-old neurologist, said in his office near the blackened hulk
of East Berlin's Oranienburger Strasse Synagogue.
   But he often sounded hesistant during an interview.
   He avoided direct criticism of the 40 years of Communist rule
and stressed that the government pays special pensions to all
victims of the Nazis, including Jews.
   He pointed out that the government pledged last year, after
seven years of stalling, to pay half of the 50-million mark cost of
restoring the Oranienburger Strasse synagogue. It was partially
burned by the Nazis and then bombed in the Allied blitz of Berlin
in 1943.
   His eyes glistened with tears when he spoke of his fears that
East Germans' new political freedoms might unleash a neo-fascist
revival.
   Unlike many of East Germany's poorly paid state-employed
doctors, Kirchner has no desire to move West.
   ``I could not imagine charging a patient,'' he said. ``The
medical system here has a lot of weaknesses, but everybody is
equal. I am used to a set income from the state.''
   Kirchner earns about 2,000 marks a month, which is worth $1,100
at the official rate, but one-tenth of that or less on the open
market.
   He paused and added, ``If neo-fascism were to arise here, I
would not know where to go now. Israel? I am too old to learn the
language.''
   Kirchner was nine when he was rounded up for deportation to
Auschwitz.
   By chance, several hundred of the 10,000 Jews seized that day
were let go, including Kirchner and his mother. Seventeen fellow
factory workers of his non-Jewish father hid the mother and child
on the outskirts of Berlin until the war ended.
   East Germany's handful of Jewish survivors and the Communists
installed in power in the post-1945 division of Europe shared a
history of persecution under Hitler's Third Reich.
   And anti-fascism was a consistent theme in the propaganda of the
government.
   Now, to some East German Jews looking over the Berlin Wall, the
most striking features are not glittering stores but rallies by the
small extreme right-wing Republican Party, which calls on younger
Germans to reject guilt feelings about the Nazi past.
   Relations have not always been easy with other Jews in the West.
A German-speaking American rabbi appointed to the East Berlin
community in 1987 left after less than a year, complaining he felt
repressed, including by the Jewish leaders. A replacement has not
yet been found.
   Some East German Jews are themselves communists.
   American-born Mrs. Runge, 47, was brought to Berlin after World
War II. As German Jews, her parents fled the Nazis in the 1930s. As
communists they fled America to return, she said, ``to help build a
new socialist Germany.''
   Unlike West Germany, which has paid more than $43 billion in
reparations to Jewish victims of Nazism and to Israel, the East
Germany government maintained it would not pay because it was not
the successor to the Third Reich.
   In recent years, the authorities signalled a change, held
meetings with the members of the World Jewish Congress and the
Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. There was
talk of a $200-million payment, but nothing yet has happened.
   ``The question of reparations is important,'' Mrs. Runge said.
``But what I most want to see now is Germans here acknowledging
responsibility for the Nazi period.''

   The Justice Department says a cleaning woman
who witnessed the massacre of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador is
in protective FBI custody in Miami.
   Lucia Barrera Cerna, 40, will be interviewed by a Salvadoran law
enforcement official investigating the Nov. 16 massacre, said
agency spokesman David Runkel.
   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich confirmed that the woman is
considered a witness, but declined to discuss what the woman has
told investigators or the extent of her knowledge of the killings.
   Runkel said the woman was admitted to the United States last
week under a special parole immigrant status. He confirmed
published reports over the weekend that the witness was in
protective FBI custody in Miami.
   Mrs. Cerna was flown to Miami from San Salvador with the
assistance of the Spanish and French governments, according to a
U.S. official who spoke condition of anonymity.
   According to unidentified officials quoted by the Miami Herald,
Mrs. Cerna saw 30 to 40 men wearing Salvadoran military uniforms
carry out the massacre.
   Bernard Kouchner, the French minister for humanitarian affairs,
said he escorted the witness, her husband and daughter on a French
plane to the United States.
   Kouchner, who was in San Salvador to attend the funerals of the
slain Jesuits, helped arrange the woman's passage to Miami after
learning she was in the Spanish Embassy.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani approved the relocation,
Kouchner said.

   Government sources say the Bush administration
may postpone a scheduled test of the troubled Trident 2
submarine-launched ballistic missile on the eve of the Malta summit.
   The launch was to be Friday off the coast of Florida, sources
speaking on condition of anonymity said Monday.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
meet off the isle of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday and
Sunday.
   ``Discussions are going as to whether to delay it until after
Malta'' so as not to spoil the atmosphere of the first summit of
the Bush administration, said one source.
   ``The date was set long before the summit'' was announced, the
source said.
   The Navy refused to confirm or deny plans to test the Trident 2
in keeping with its policy of announcing such launches 24 hours in
advance.
   The Trident 2 failed its most recent sea test, Aug. 15, passed
the one before that, on Aug. 2, and spectacularly failed its first
submarine-launched flight, March 21, cartwheeling out of control
four seconds after it was fired from the submarine the USS
Tennessee.
   It passed 16 of its first 19 tests, fired from land.
   The Trident 2, at $26.5 million per copy, is designed to replace
the Trident 1 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Each of the
44-foot-long, three-stage Trident 2's can deliver three to 12
warheads to individual targets up to 6,000 miles away.

   Nina Rubinstein was just weeks away from her
doctorate when the Nazis occupied her university in 1933.
   Her thesis was on her desk at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University
in Frankfurt. Her formal education was over; she would flee to
Paris, later to New York.
   Next week, Miss Rubinstein, 81, will present her thesis to
professors at the West German university.
   If all goes as planned, she'll get the degree.
   ``Better late than never,'' said David Kettler, a professor at
Trent University in Ontario and one of those who initiated the
effort to have her work recognized.
   Miss Rubinstein's supporters say recognition of her work is a
victory for academic freedom in a land where Nazis expelled Jewish
and leftist professors and students. Among those who remained,
Kettler said, ``the lack of civil courage was a disaster.''
   For Miss Rubinstein, a retired United Nations interpreter, it
means she has to reread the 247-page manuscript that sat on a shelf
in her Manhattan apartment for 40 years.
   ``I had forgotten most of it,'' she said Monday. ``I'm still not
finished.''
   She'll participate in a colloquium on the thesis, which
ironically concerns political emigration after the French
Revolution.
   The thesis almost didn't make it out of Frankfurt after the
Nazis occupied the building.
   ``We were standing there, pretty helpless,'' she recalled. ``It
occurred to me that there was one student who was a Nazi. I
wouldn't have talked to him, normally. I asked him to get my
thesis. He got it and I disappeared.''
   She went to Paris, where she stayed until 1940, when Hitler's
armies approached. Again she fled, this time leaving everything
behind _ including the thesis.
   A French neighbor kept Miss Rubinstein's belongings, and after
the war traced her to New York. The manuscript sat on a shelf for
decades _ becoming ``not very important in my life'' _ until her
half-sister, Hanna Papanek, tried unsuccessfully to get it
published in the 1970s.
   Claudia Honegger, a professor at Goethe, persuaded the
university to recognize the work, Kettler said.
   ``This is important because, I think, the university is making a
public statement, a practical statement that it recognizes a wrong
was done,'' Kettler said. ``Not to a big shot, but to an ordinary
person, and they are making good on it not out of pity, but on the
merits of the case.''
   The awarding of the degree coincides with the 75th anniversary
celebration for the university's social science institute, where
Miss Rubinstein was a 25-year-old student in 1933.
   The institute's dean, Lothar Brock, said the event ``has a
special meaning to both Nina Rubinstein and the university. It is a
good occasion not just to talk about these people but to have them
here.''
   Kettler said that while German universities were not responsible
for Nazi-era atrocities, ``They were responsible for the way they
dealt as institutions with the people who were victimized by their
complicity during the Nazi period. There were very, very serious
sins of omission.''
   Ms. Papanek said: ``Many of the other people who were expelled
or had to flee have died. It's a lucky thing that Nina is alive and
can accept this as recognition of work she did in her youth.''
   Miss Rubinstein's professor was the noted sociologist Karl
Mannheim, who accepted her thesis but was suspended from the
university along with other Jewish and left-wing faculty. He fled
Germany.
   ``My professor wrote me a letter, saying, `Since you completed
your thesis, there's no reason not to get in touch with another
professor and pass your exam,''' Miss Rubinstein said. ``He was
naive.''
   She was concerned about the interruption, ``but I must say that
with all the political events dominating, you didn't have too much
time to think about that.''
   As a child, Miss Rubinstein and her mother moved from Germany to
Denmark at the outbreak of World War I, then from the Soviet Union
to Germany when the Bolsheviks took over in 1918. Her topic grew
out of the experience of Russian emigres, and is relevant today,
she said.
   ``In our time, the problem of emigration is quite important,''
said Rubinstein, who is fluent in English, German, Russian and
French.
   ``It's very much a current topic,'' said her half-sister. ``What
Nina looks at is the experience of being a stranger. ... It really
became a forecast of things to come. When she worked on it, she had
no way of knowing that.''

<HEAD>PLO Seeks Elevation to Nation Status in General Assembly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Against vehement U.S. objections, Arab
nations plan to push a resolution through the General Assembly this
week that would recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as
a nation.
   The State Department immediately threatened to cut off all U.S.
support for the United Nations if the General Assembly approves the
move. Washington is assessed $216 million annually _ one-fourth of
the U.N. budget.
   ``We feel so strongly about this we would cut off funds,'' State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Monday.
   Riyad Mansour, the PLO's deputy permanent observer, said the
resolution would be introduced in connection with the General
Assembly's debate on Palestine, which opens Wednesday.
   ``The political significance is that the General Assembly
accepts the state of Palestine as part of the U.N. system _ at this
stage, as an observer,'' Mansour said.
   The PLO has observer status as an organization at the United
Nations. The only other observer group is the South-West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO), which this month won
pre-independence elections in Namibia, where it had fought South
African rule.
   If the Arab resolution is apparoved the PLO will gain national
observer status. The would put it on a par with North and South
Korea, Monaco, the Vatican, San Marino and Switzerland, which lack
voting rights and can only address the assembly by invitation.
   The resolution should easily gain the required simple majority
of votes in the 159-member General Assembly. Most members of the
non-aligned movement, with more than 100 votes, and communist
nations would vote in favor.
   In Rome, Arab states are calling on the U.N.-affiliated Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) to cooperate with the PLO in
distributing food to Palestinians. That brought a U.S. threat to
cut funds to the FAO.
   A vote on that issue proposal could be held by Wednesday.
   Ms. Tutwiler said, ``We strongly support humanitarian assistance
to the Palestinian people'' and noted the U.S. contribution this
year is $63 million. ``The PLO should not be a conduit for
international assistance to the Palestinians,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States was making it clear in notes
to various governments and to officials at the United Nations that
``any action to change the PLO status will have the most serious
adverse consequences.''
   Mansour said, ``Resorting to blackmail in conducting
international diplomacy is not useful to anyone.''
   Congress recently passed a foreign appropriations bill that
requires the Bush administration to cut funds for any organization
that moves to recognize the PLO.
   Last year, the PLO declared the existence of a state of
Palestine in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Mansour said 117 nations have recognized ``Palestine.'' The
United States, most European countaries and some Latin American
nations have refused, saying the proclaimed state lacks the basic
attributes of a nation.
   Arab members in the FAO's governing General Conference have
introduced a resolution calling on the agency to ``provide the
Palestinian people with the assistance necessary for their economic
development in close cooperation with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.''
   It asks the FAO to include the Israeli-occupied territories in
``future programs and activities in line with present cooperation
and coordination between the Palestine Liberation Organization and
other United Nations agencies.''
   U.S. officials said the action politicizes the FAO, which has as
its mandate promoting agriculture and food supplies in the Third
World.
   Earlier this year the United States blocked PLO attempts to be
recognized as a nation in the World Health Organization and the
U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eliana Martinez, an 8-year-old AIDS-afflicted
girl who won a landmark 2{-year court battle to attend public
school, died Monday, a spokesman said.
   Eliana died in her bed at home at about 5:30 p.m., said Dan
McClowry, Eliana's former speech therapist and a friend of the
family.
   ``She had been in and out of a coma for the last three days,''
he said. ``She had some good moments and some bad moments. Today,
she smiled at us and last night she even laughed.''
   Eliana's adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez, and a few family
friends had been sitting up with the child for the last few days
knowing death was near, McClowry said.
   Eliana's body would be taken Tuesday morning to the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., for an autopsy, McClowry
said. Funeral services were tentatively scheduled for early next
week in Tampa, he said.
   Doctors took Eliana off the experimental AIDS-fighting drug DDI
on Oct. 4, saying it wasn't protecting her from life-threatening,
AIDS-related infections. Eliana had been given AZT, the only
federally aproved AIDS drug, for two years and was switched when it
was no longer helping her.
   In April, Eliana went to class for the first time after her
mother won a court battle with the Hillsborough County School Board
to get Eliana enrolled in a school for ``special needs'' children.
   Education officials wanted the mentally disabled child kept on
homebound instruction until she was potty-trained and learned to
stop sucking her fingers. They feared she posed a risk of
transmitting acquired immune deficiency syndrome to classmates and
teachers.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich ruled Eliana could
attend school if she stayed inside a specially-built glass booth.
   Mrs. Martinez said she wouldn't send her daughter to class to
sit in a cage. The child needed to be with other children to help
her develop, she said. Her attorney Steve Hanlon appealed, and won.
Eliana went to school without the glass enclosure.
   Psychologists and pediatricians who care for AIDS children said
the isolation booth setting would cause stress and be harmful to
the girl's already weakened immune system.
   Mrs. Martinez, a 37-year-old licensed practical nurse, adopted
Eliana in her native Puetro Rico. She responded to a radio appeal
for a sickly, homeless child living at a hospital. Eliana, who got
AIDS from a transfusion of tainted blood, was 11-months-old and
weighed only about 10 pounds when Mrs. Martinez took her home.
   At first doctors thought the baby might have cerebral palsy. It
wasn't until the spring of 1985 that Mrs. Martinez and her husband,
Jose, learned Eliana had AIDS-related complex or ARC, a precursor
to AIDS.

   A woman gave birth prematurely after being
attacked by a pit bull and a husky while unsuccessfully defending
her cat.
   Kathleen MacKenzie gave birth to a son Sunday by Caesarean
section, six days premature and four hours after the attack in the
parking lot of her apartment complex. She also had surgery on her
right arm for wounds suffered in the attack.
   Ms. MacKenzie's son, Andrew Scott, was listed in good condition
at the Seton Medical Center on Monday.
   Also Monday, Ms. MacKenzie filed a lawsuit against the dogs'
owner. She accuses Joseph Chernoff of keeping the dogs in a
populated area, failing to notify proper authorities when he found
that his dogs had escaped, and negligence for allowing the dogs to
run loose.
   Ms. MacKenzie, a 31-year-old legal assistant, said she was
trying to save her cat, Mew, from the 110-pound Akita Japanese
husky and the 50-pound pit bull terrier when the larger dog jumped
on her back and knocked her on her stomach.
   Police killed the dogs when they threatened to attack officers.
   Chernoff was issued two citations by animal control officers,
said Dan Pickens, spokesman for the city Health Department. Each
violation carries a maximum fine of $200.
   Chernoff, who said he has received more than 50 threatening
telephone calls since the attack, said he wasn't surprised that the
husky attacked Ms. MacKenzie.
   ``He's bitten some friends before,'' Chernoff said. ``He doesn't
like strangers to touch him. If they (police) shot him, I'm not
shocked. I've thought about shooting him myself.
   ``These were probably the two finest dogs in Austin except the
big one was born with a bad personality,'' Chernoff said. ``I don't
understand them shooting the little one, I never will.''
   Ms. MacKenzie seeks unspecified damages in her lawsuit for
current and future medical expenses, the loss of her dead cat,
current and future pain and suffering, and replacement of income
lost during her recuperation.
   The lawsuit also seeks punitive damages ``to serve as an example
to others who might be disposed to keeping vicious dogs and
allowing said dogs to roam at large.''

<TEXT>
   A charter bus carrying ABC
employees to Monday night's National Football League game was
struck by a train, killing two people and injuring about 25, police
said.
   The bus had stopped between grade crossing gates for an unknown
reason during the evening rush hour, police said.
   One victim was an ABC Sports executive from New York and the
other a network sales executive based in Los Angeles, said Bob
Wheeler, ABC's manager of sports information. They were in town for
the broadcast of Monday Night Football, which was celebrating its
20th anniversary.
   The victims' names were withheld until relatives were notified.
   The bus was the third in a convoy of four vehicles full of ABC
employees and clients who had taken a cruise on San Francisco Bay
and were headed to Candlestick Park to watch the San Francisco
49ers play the New York Giants, Wheeler said.
   Train No. 58 was traveling at 60 mph when the collision
occurred, said Bob Hoppe, a spokesman for Southern Pacific
Railroad, which operates the line.
   The bus apparently stopped on the tracks behind a double
tractor-trailer truck shortly before the 5 p.m. crash about five
miles south of San Francisco, said police officer Greg Heard. The
CalTrain commuter train did not derail.
   ``The gates came down and the bus was stuck,'' said Heard. ``The
driver tried to get around and honked his horn several times to
clear traffic.''
   As many as 25 people were injured, Heard said. The two people
who died were ``thrown into the track area,'' he said.
   No one on the train were injured, according to spokesmen for
Southern Pacific.
   Hornblower Yachts, a San Francisco yachting service, chartered
the bus, the service said in a statement. The bus was owned by San
Francisco-based International Coach, said Daniel Coles, operations
manager for the bus company.
   The driver, Paul Cang, 33, of Foster City, was treated for
multiple injuries at Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame, hospital
spokeswoman Traci Ward said.
   The CalTrain commute service from San Francisco to San Jose is
offered by Southern Pacific through contract with the state
Department of Transportation.
   Passengers remained on the train and service was halted in both
directions for 90 minutes.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange overcame
morning setbacks and reached a record-high closing Tuesday, while
the dollar edged up against the yen.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.65 yen, up 0.30 yen from
Monday's close of 143.35 yen. It opened lower at 143.33 yen and
gradually rose while ranging between 143.33 yen and 143.70 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 103.77 points, or 0.28
percent, ending at 36,985.30, yet another high. The index just
reached a record high the previous day, when it gained 397.06
points to a 36,881.53-point close.
   Securities dealers said the index, which fell marginally in the
morning, recovered in the afternoon when institutional investors
began buying as they were reassured by stability on the exchange
market and short term interst rates.
   Trading was hectic with an estimated 1.5 billion shares changing
hands on the market's first section.
   In currency dealings, the dollar, which was lower against the
yen in early trading, rose back as speculative investors bought the
U.S. currency, dealers said.
   The West German mark remained strong against other major
currency following recent moves toward democracy and economic
reform in Eastern Europe, they said.
   The Bank of Japan's governor, Satoshi Sumita, said Tuesday that
the central bank will conduct concerted intervention if the market
continues to fluctuate excessively, Kyodo News Service reported.

<HEAD>Honecker: `Old, Broken' Man, Visited Only By Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker, the Communist who ruled East
Germany for nearly two decades until his ouster last month, is a
``broken man'' whose only solace is visiting with his grandson, his
bodyguard says.
   ``What's he got to live for? Honecker is so sick that he cannot
show himself in public,'' the aide, Gen. Guenter Wolf, told Western
reporters outside Honecker's home in the former party elite's
exclusive Wandlitz compound.
   ``He is a broken man. For him the world has fallen apart,'' Wolf
told the reporters who were allowed to visit the wooded residential
compound just north of East Berlin for the first time Monday.
   The 77-year-old hard-line leader was ousted Oct. 18 following an
exodus of East Germans to the West and huge demonstrations for
democratic reform.
   He was replaced by his protege, Egon Krenz, who promptly
promised reform and has tried to distance himself from his
hard-line mentor.
   A party commission is conducting an investigation of Honecker
that could result in his ouster from the party. A special
parliamentary commission is also investigating charges of abuse of
power by his 18-year administration.
   Meanwhile, Honecker sits inside the two-story brown house,
waiting for a visit from his grandson, Wolf said.
   Reporters caught a glimpse of Honecker on the upper floor of the
house, apparently talking to a visitor and looking through some
papers at a table. No contact was possible.
   A young woman with a child in her arms could be seen in the
background. When she saw reporters outside, she pulled the shades
down.
   ``Honecker's daughter from Berlin takes care of him. And his
young grandson is everything to him,'' Wolf said. He said Honecker
received hardly any visits except from his family but offered no
further details about them.
   The house has no nameplate, only the number 11 on the short
sandstone wall around the building. It is one of 23 houses in the
compound _ once the secret pride of the country's Communist elite.
   Wolf assured reporters that Honecker's house contained ``no
Italian marble, no silk wallpaper and no sauna.'' It looked modest
by Western standards, but more than any ordinary East German could
hope for in a lifetime.
   A beige East German-made Wartburg was parked outside the house.
Wolf said it belonged to Honecker's wife, Margot, who lost her post
as education minister shortly after her husband's ouster.
   A week ago Krenz, understanding the resentment struggling East
Germans felt toward leaders who lived in luxury, moved to a modest
house in East Berlin and said other leading party officials would
follow.
   Wolf said Honecker and his wife want to move from Wandlitz
before the end of the year.
   Several other ousted Politburo members also still live in
Wandlitz, including former economic adviser Guenter Mittag and
former propaganda chief Kurt Hager.
   Wandlitz residents have been told to stop using French-made
Citroens and to use East German Wartburgs or Soviet-made Ladas when
going to East Berlin.
   Kiwis and pineapples have been removed from the exclusive shop
in the compound and replaced by products that can be found in
ordinary stores.
   A sales clerk, Jutta Wittig, said Honecker's preferred wine was
a dry white, Mueller-Thurgau from Miessen. She said the Honeckers
always ate healthy food, with lots of curds.
   She said Honecker had ``good taste,'' always ordering dark blue
suits with white shirts.
   Krenz's new leadership has blamed Honecker and Mittag for
plunging the country into the crisis and Mittag has been kicked out
of the party. Krenz, however, has said that Honecker is too ill to
be interrogated by the party commission.
   Honecker underwent two gall-bladder operations this summer and
his wife has also told East German media that he still has not
recovered fully.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index climbed to a
new high for the fifth consecutive trading day today, while the
dollar rose against the yen after a four-day decline.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell in morning trading but
ended up gaining 103.77 points, or 0.28 percent, closing at
36,985.30. The previous record high of 36,881.53 was set Monday,
when the index gained 397.06 points.
   After initial profit-taking sales, investors started buying a
wide variety of issues in the afternoon, dealers said.
   ``Institutional investors, who had remained on the sidelines for
a long time holding cash in their hands, finally started buying
issues because they thought they were going to miss an opportunity
to make money as share prices rise higher and higher,'' said a
Nomura Securities dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   An estimated 1.5 billion shares changed hands on the first
section, up from 1 billion the previous day. Among gainers were
real estate and trading house issues.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.65 yen, up 0.30
yen from Monday's 143.35-yen finish. The currency opened at 143.33
yen, its low for the day, and ranged up to 143.70 yen.
   The dollar had lost a total of 1.32 yen over the four previous
trading days.
   Although dollar-yen trading was quiet early today, the dollar
strengthened in the afternoon as speculative and institutional
investors, including trading houses, started buying the U.S.
currency, said Hisashi Matsuda, a trader with Daiwa Bank.
   Many investors who had been selling dollars to buy West German
marks were buying back dollars with yen for technical adjustments.
   ``Whenever there is no market-affecting news, Japanese investors
tend to buy the dollar, and that's basically what happened today,''
Matsuda said.
   ``The West German mark was weakening a little at one point as
market players sold the currency for profit-taking, but it soon
recovered,'' he said.
   Although the market had been expecting the yen's relative rise
along with the mark's recovery, the yen gradually fell, Matsuda
added.
   Market players have been buying the West German mark since a
series of recent democratic and economic reforms began in Eastern
European nations. Investors expect West Germany to benefit from
those reforms.

<TEXT>
   Two pee-wee football teams set out last week for
Florida to play in their league's Sunshine Bowl. Countless delays,
a stolen bus and two decisive losses later, the players' dream trip
had become a nightmare.
   ``The experience was like something you read in a horror book,''
said a parent chaperone Russ Hayes, who broke into tears. ``It was
very traumatic.''
   There was one consolation.
   ``Well, we got to Disney World,'' Hayes' 12-year-old son,
Michael, said of the Thanksgiving trip. ``The worst part was we
didn't get much sleep.''
   On Monday _ a day later than their scheduled return _ 12 of the
116 players, coaches and chaperones returned to Chicago. Others
were expected to straggle in by bus.
   ``It's been one terrible experience after another,'' Michael's
mother, Jacqueline, said as she waited at O'Hare International
Airport. ``It's been a terrible nightmare for all of them.''
   ``We're totally exhausted. We've had a very, very trying five
days,'' coach Rino Liberatore said after stepping off the plane.
``We lost the football game, we lost the bus, we lost our money,
but hopefully we didn't lose our spirit.''
   The 1,100-mile bus trip to Florida got off to a bad start
Wednesday night when one of the three rented buses arrived three
hours late.
   Things went downhill from there.
   Once the teams got on the road, two of the buses broke down,
filling with exhaust and causing many in the group to fall ill.
   Delays for repairs made the players arrive 13 hours late in
Orlando, Fla.
   The 9- to 14-year-old members of the two Chicago teams had to
cut short a visit to Walt Disney World and rest up for the next
day's games against two Florida teams.
   Then, while they were playing, one of the buses was stolen _
along with at least $3,000 in cash donated to help pay for the trip
and many wallets belonging to the travelers.
   To make matters worse, the teams lost their games _ 22-0 and
48-6.
   ``I wasn't into the game a lot,'' said Michael Hayes, a running
back from Burlington, Wis. ``I was still thinking about the trip.''
   The players, from the Pop Warner League, earned the money for
their trip after winning the bowl invitation in local play.
   The teams financed the trip by selling candy and collecting
contributions. Local corporations, including the Chicago Bears,
matched the sum collected by the youngsters.
   Team officials blamed the problems on Falcon Motorcoach Co.,
complaining that the Chicago company rented them buses that were
old and poorly serviced.
   ``We've been put in a situation that I don't think anybody
should have to when they're traveling on the road like that with a
group of kids,'' said Liberatore, adding that he hopes to get a
refund from the bus company.
   Kenneth Arnold, co-owner of Falcon, said two of the three buses
had been leased from another company. He declined to name the
company or say why Falcon leased from it, adding: ``A breakdown can
happen at any time and anywhere.''
   Michael Hayes said he was glad to be home. Despite all the
problems, he said he'd go on such a trip again _ under the right
conditions.
   ``If I ever go again,'' he said, ``I'd have someone look over
the bus first before we leave.''

   A man known as ``the gentleman bandit''
because he promised to send a rose and said ``have a nice day''
after taking money pleaded guilty to robbing two savings and loans.
   Kevin Lee Newby, 34, of Grandview, Mo., entered the plea Monday
in U.S. District Court. Sentencing was set for Jan. 29.
   Newby originally had been charged with robbing five Kansas City
area banks between April and August. The remaining three counts
will be dismissed at the time of sentencing, according to a plea
agreement.
   Newby pleaded guilty to robbing the First Federal Savings and
Loan Association in Grandview, Mo., on April 24, and the World
Savings &amp; Loan Association in Lenexa, Kan., on Aug. 9.

   A fundamentalist Hindu party has
catapulted into a key power-broking position after national
elections, and its leader pledges to end the rule of Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
   ``I will see to it that the prime minister falls,'' said Lal
Krishna Advani, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party, as dozens of
supporters flocked to his New Delhi home, draping him with garlands
of marigolds.
   The party registered huge gains in the elections for
Parliament's powerful lower house, winning at least 73 seats. In
the last election it won two.
   Analysts have linked its rise to a revival of Hindu
fundmentalism epitomized by plans to build a new Hindu temple on
the site of a 16th century mosque.
   The temple plans, which were supported by the party, sparked
riots this fall between Hindus and Moslems in which at least 300
people were killed.
   Advani said he opposes violence but added that the government
must stop its ``reverse discrimination'' against Hindus, who make
up 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
   As congratulatory phone calls came in and party activists
munched cakes and sweets Monday, the party chief said he was ready
to unite with other opposition groups to end ``a corrupt dynasty.''
The reference was to the Gandhi-Nehru clan that has occupied the
prime minister's office for all but five years since India won
indepenence in 1947.
   Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime
minister. The job later passed to his daughter Indira Gandhi,
mother of the present prime minister.
   Incomplete election results showed that Gandhi's Congress Party
would not win a majority in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, or House of the
People, the lower house of Parliament that chooses the prime
minister.
   But the main opposition group, the National Front, was running
behind Congress.
   The scene was thus set for Advani's party to play the crucial
power-broking role.
   Of all the main parties, Advani's is the most conservative. It
favors development of India's nuclear forces and strict policing of
border areas with Pakistan and Bangladesh.
   It also pushes Hindu rights, advocating the abolition of a
commission set up to protect minorities. In addition, it encourages
privatization. A large percentage of India's industry is state-run.
   Advani, 62, won a Parliament seat in New Delhi. Party colleagues
posted victories throughout the plains of northern India.
   Some political commentators are concerned that the rise of his
party symbolizes a growing split in the Indian political scene.
   But others welcome the inclusion of such elements in Parliament
because, they say, it forces them to compromise and thereby
modifies their fundamentalism.
   But at Advani's house Monday, there was little talk of
compromise.
   ``We are very powerful now,'' the party boss said. ``The people
have spoken.''

<HEAD>Gunfire, Mortar Blasts Awaken Capital to Renewed Fighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mortars exploded and gunfire
resounded in northern San Salvador today, awakening capital
residents to renewed fighting between government forces and leftist
rebels.
   It was the first time this week that the fighting appeared to be
anything but brief exchanges between the two sides.
   About 10 flares were dropped by circling helicopters over the
northern neighborhoods of Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado, and more
than two dozen mortar rounds shattered the pre-dawn silence.
   Because of a dusk-to-dawn curfew, the extent of the combat was
not immediately clear. Assault-rifle and occasional machine-gun
fire was heard, but those exchanges were not heavy or sustained.
   On Nov. 11, guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front launched their biggest offensive of the decade-old
civil war. More than 1,000 people died in 12 days of combat in San
Salvador and several provincial cities.
   The rebels have said that fighting, which turned the capital
into a battleground, was the first phase of a broader operation.
   The rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani contends
it defeated the insurgent push. But Cristiani also said last week,
``They (the guerrillas) are doing some things that look more like
regrouping than retreating.''
   Despite $3.5 billion in U.S. aid, Salvadoran government forces
have been unable to defeat the rebels. The war has claimed the
lives of at least 71,000 people, mostly civilians.
   Thousands of civilians who lost their lives in the conflict were
slain by right-wing death squads early in the decade.
   This fall, attacks on leftist civilian leaders resumed and, on
Nov. 16, six Jesuit priests were murdered along with their cook and
her teen-age daughter.
   The military was widely blamed for the massacre and a cleaning
woman, Lucia Barrera de Cerna, has sworn she saw the the killers
wearing uniforms.
   Cristiani has promised a full investigation.
   Government and military officials have accused clergy and church
workers of sympathizing with and even supporting the rebels.
   On Sunday, an American church worker, Jennifer Jean Casolo, was
arrested after authorities raided her home and said they found
explosives and 80,000 rounds of ammunition for assault rifles.
   Ms. Casolo, 28, of Thomaston, Conn., was still in the custody of
the National Police on Monday, said Jeff Brown, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman in El Salvador.
   He said she was being questioned and had not been charged as of
late Monday. She works for the Christian Educational Seminar, based
in San Antonio.
   Under the state-of-siege imposed after the rebels launched their
offensive Nov. 11, authorities have up to 15 days to file charges
or release someone instead of the normal 72 hours.
   White House officials say the evidence against Ms. Casolo is
strong, but friends and associates say she was framed as part of
the government's campaign to discredit church workers.

   A college student who disappeared while
jogging alone was found dead in a riverbed three days later after a
search by neighbors and residents of this small Northwest town.
   An autopsy report was expected today on Amanda Stavik, 18.
Whatcom County Sheriff Larry Mount said she was murdered.
   ``All these terrible things, all you can think is it doesn't
happen to you. It doesn't happen on Strand Road. And it did,'' said
Mary Stavik, the girl's mother, before the body was found Monday.
``People here aren't even careful about locking their doors.''
   The body was found about noon Monday in the shallow South Fork
of the Nooksack River, a few miles from Ms. Stavik's family home on
Strand Road. The woman apparently had been abducted while jogging
alone Friday.
   As word spread, residents gathered at a supermarket in this
farming community of about 350 residents in the Cascade Mountain
foothills, 80 miles north of Seattle and 20 miles south of the
Canadian border.
   ``I didn't think that kind of thing happened here,'' said
Tiffany La Monte, 17, a friend of Ms. Stavik.
   Many of the Staviks' neighbors had joined the search in the
forested hills hills and along Washington 9, a winding two-lane
road. Donations to a reward fund for evidence on the killer
exceeded $8,300, said organizer Jim Kyle.
   Ms. Stavik, a freshman at Central Washington University in
Ellensburg, was seen by her 13-year-old brother, Lee, when she went
jogging with her dog, Kyra, while home from college on Thanksgiving
break. The dog returned alone.
   Mount said the woman's body was naked except for her running
shoes. There was no evidence of struggle at the site, leading
investigators to suspect the body floated downstream, said
Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Peterson.
   A pair of sweat pants that may have belonged to the girl were
found about 10 miles south of the Stavik home. Mount said the pants
were being tested at the state crime laboratory.
   The FBI was helping the investigation, and officials planned to
enlist the Green River Task Force, a Seattle-based team of
detectives with expertise in abduction. The task force was formed
to pursue a serial killer, but there was no indication Ms. Stavik's
slaying had any connection to the unsolved killings in the Seattle
area.
   At Central Washington University, 100 miles southeast of
Seattle, a reporter found a note on a school riderboard with a
message from Ms. Stavik seeking a ride to the Bellingham area for
Thanksgiving. Acme is just outside Bellingham.
   The FBI was interviewing Ms. Stavik's classmates.
   Several of her friends broke into tears while watching
television news reports on the case.
   ``I was just watching the news and couldn't believe it was
anyone so close,'' said Michelle Mix, who lived a few doors from
the victim in a dormitory.
   ``It just gives you a feeling like, gosh, we were seeing each
other in the bathroom,'' Ms. Mix said. ``One day you see them. One
day you don't.''
   Mrs. Stavik said her daughter, known as Mandy, had been ``very
happy and positive and feeling good about school.'' School
spokeswoman Barbara Radke said Ms. Stavik had taken her Japanese
roommate home for the holiday.

<HEAD>Recount Next Step In Virginia Election For Governor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Virginia's closest and most prolonged
election for governor next goes before a three-judge panel that
will supervise a recount requested by the Republican who lost to
Democrat L. Douglas Wilder.
   J. Marshall Coleman, a former attorney general, said Monday he
wants a recount and an investigation of alleged irregularities in
the Nov. 7 balloting.
   The State Board of Elections said that Wilder beat Coleman by
6,854 votes, or .38 percent, out of nearly 1.8 million votes cast.
Unofficial returns had showed a 6,852-vote lead for Wilder, the
state's lieutenant governor who will be the nation's first elected
black governor.
   Coleman is entitled to a taxpayer-funded recount if the margin
is less than half a percent. Election results have been overturned
in at least one recount of a local race in Virginia, but this will
be the first statewide recount.
   Coleman said he would contest the election to the General
Assembly unless the recount and other information convinces him
that the proceeding is ``no longer necessary to safeguard the
accuracy and integrity'' of the election.
   In a notice to General Assembly leaders, Coleman said voter
registration lists used in the election contained the names of
people ineligible to vote.
   ``In an election as close as this one, irregularities which
would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a
greater importance,'' Coleman said in an accompanying letter.
   A panel of three judges will rule on the recount, which will
involve a check of each paper ballot and election machine.
Seventy-five of the state's 1,967 precincts still use paper ballots
that are kept under seal in local clerks' offices, said Susan
Fitz-Hugh, secretary of the State Board of Elections.
   The judges _ the chief judge of the Richmond Circuit Court and
two others appointed by the Virginia Supreme Court _ will hold a
hearing to decide how to conduct the recount.
   She could not predict how long it would take, but said, ``We
usually have finished all our recounts prior to Christmas.''
   If Coleman contests the election, the matter would first come
before the privileges and elections committees of the House and
Senate, said state Sen. Stanley C. Walker, the Democratic president
pro tempore of the Senate.
   Walker, who won a contested election for his Senate seat in
1979, said the proceeding would resemble a trial with lawyers for
both candidates presenting witnesses and evidence to the
legislators.

<HEAD>Head of Tiffany's Dies at 91</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter Hoving, who enforced his standards of
taste in jewelry as head of Tiffany's for 25 years, has died. He
was 91.
   Hoving died Monday at Newport Hospital in Rhode Island, where he
had been a patient for two weeks, according to today's editions of
The New York Times. There was no word on the cause of his death.
   When he bought a controlling share of Tiffany and Co. in 1955,
it was doing $7 million worth of business a year and appeared to be
fading. But by 1980, the store and its five branches were taking in
$100 million.
   Among the breaches of taste Hoving forbade at Tiffany's were
silver plate and diamond rings for men.
   He would not make an exception to his ideas of propriety even
for President Kennedy. In one story told about Hoving, Kennedy
asked him for 32 lucite calendar memos to give to aides who had
worked with him during the Cuban missile crisis.
   But Hoving wouldn't hear of Tiffany's working in plastic, and
the request was changed to silver.
   ``Design what you think is beautiful, and don't worry about
selling it,'' he would tell his designers, like Elsa Perrett or
Jean Schlumberger. ``That's our job.''
   Hoving resigned as chairman in 1980, a year after the company
was bought by Avon Products. It is now publicly owned again and its
stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Hoving was born in Stockholm in 1897 and came to the United
States with his parents in 1903. He earned a bachelor's degree from
Brown University.
   During his career, he worked at R.H. Macy &amp; Company, Montgomery
Ward &amp; Company and Lord &amp; Taylor, the latter as president.
   A private family service was to be held today in Newport.

<HEAD>Radiologists: New Imaging Technique Could Help In Diagnosis of Alzheimer's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer-enhanced X-ray technique could help
doctors diagnose Alzheimer's disease and paranoid schizophrenia by
allowing them, in effect, to look not just at the brain but at the
mind, radiologists say.
   The technique, called SPECT, ``may turn out to be the single
most important imaging method we have to diagnose Alzheimer's,''
Dr. Frederick J. Bonte said Monday at the 75th general assembly of
the Radiological Society of North America.
   ``Traditional imaging methods such as computed tomography and
magnetic resonance haven't been able to contribute much to the
diagnosis of Alzheimer's, except to rule out other conditions that
may cause Alzheimer's-like symptoms,'' he said.
   But SPECT actually gives images of the physiological processes
in the brain, rather than merely the organ's structure, said Bonte,
director of the Nuclear Medicine Research Center at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
   Using SPECT, he and his co-workers accurately have identified
about 150 of 170 dementia patients as victims of Alzheimer's, an
incurable disease of aging that afflicts up to four million
Americans.
   Alzheimer's causes memory lapses, confusion, loss of ability to
function and eventually death, and often goes undiagnosed for two
or three years because people wrongly attribute early symptoms to
normal effects of aging.
   Though no treatment exists for the disease, SPECT could be
valuable in separating treatable types of dementia that resemble
Alzheimer's from actual Alzheimer's, Bonte said. Also, when
researchers do devise treatments, SPECT could be used to monitor
their effectiveness, he said.
   In SPECT, an acronym for single photon emission computed
tomography, patients are injected with a radio-pharmaceutical, a
chemical compound that emits a small amount of radiation.
   The chemical travels to the brain, where it settles into the
tissues in direct proportion to the amount of blood flow in that
area of the brain, Bonte said.
   ``Alzheimer's is characterized by abnormalites in brain blood
flow,'' he said. ``Early in the disease, brain cells begin to die
and this reduces the flow of blood in that portion of the brain.
These areas show up very well with SPECT.''
   SPECT scanning could become generally available within a year or
two, he said. It takes less than four minutes to perform, and costs
about $450, compared with $800 for a CAT scan and $1,000 for MRI,
Bonte said.
   The technique uses a machine that would be affordable to most
community hospitals and could be used for constructing images of
organs besides the brain, he said.
   Dr. Theodore R. Simon, deputy chief of nuclear medicine at the
Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md., reported that SPECT also has proven useful in diagnosing or
confirming diagnoses of paranoid schizophrenia and other
psychiatric disorders, such as depression.
   ``Until now, psychiatric diseases have been diagnosed
subjectively, primarily through clinical observation of behavior,''
Simon said. ``SPECT provides an objective technique to view the
physical evidence of schizophrenia in the brain and confirm the
clinical diagnosis.''
   Schizophrenia afflicts an estimated two to five of every 1,000
Americans, causing symptoms that may include impairment in
thinking, delusions, hallucinations, changes in emotions and
changes in behavior, according to the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill.
   Paranoid schizophrenia is a subtype of the disease characterized
by feelings of persecution, or less commonly, grandiosity,
according to the Arlington, Va.-based organization.

<TEXT>
   Abu Nidal, among the most feared
Palestinian terrorist leaders, is hospitalized in the Libyan
capital of Tripoli with what Algerian sources described today as
``terminal cancer.''
   One Algerian medical source who recently returned from Libya
denied a published report that Abu Nidal has been placed under
house arrest by Libyan police in response to pressure from Egypt
and the PLO.
   ``In reality, Abu Nidal is in a military hospital in Libya
suffering from a cancerous metastasis which is probably terminal,''
the Algerian physician said. He insisted that his name be withheld.
   Metastasis is the spread of disease from one part of the body to
another.
   Other Algerian sources recalled that Abu Nidal, 52, was treated
in Bulgaria for cancerous complications several years ago.
   The sources attributed the report, in today's New York Times,
that he had been arrested by the Libyan authorities to officials in
Cairo or Tripoli seeking to conceal the severity of his illness.
   The Algerian doctor said he was summoned to Tripoli a week ago
for consultations with a Libyan colleague. He denied having seen
Abu Nidal himself.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is wanted for
terrorist acts in countries throughout the world. He has lived in
Libya since his 1987 expulsion from Syria.
   He allegedly played a leading role in crimes including the
bloody attack on the Israeli delegation at the 1972 Olympic games
in Munich and the 1985 hijacking of an Egyptian airliner in which
56 passengers were killed in Malta during a rescue attempt.
   He is also blamed for the coordinated attacks on airline
passengers in Rome and Vienna in December 1985.
   In all, nearly 1,000 people have been killed or wounded in 20
countries due to activites by Abu Nidal's 15-year-old group, the
Fatah Revolutionary Council.
   The group has been at odds with the PLO for many years. Many of
its major leaders have defected to the main body of the PLO
recently, leaving Abu Nidal increasingly isolated.
   In October 1973, a ``war tribunal'' of the Palestine Liberation
Organization sentenced its former representative in Baghdad, Abu
Nidal, to death for armed sedition, murder of PLO members,
violating the ``laws of the revoultion'' and provoking conflicts
within the organization.
   The sentence was never carried out.
   The Times quoted unnamed Arab diplomats and PLO officials in
Paris as saying Abu Nidal had in recent days been confined to a
compound near Tripoli because of pressure from Egypt and the PLO.
   In October, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt asked Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi to extradite Abu Nidal to Egypt or stop his
organization's terrorist acts from Libya, the paper quoted PLO
officials in Tunisia and Arab diplomats in Paris as saying.
   The request was a condition for restored relations between Libya
and Egypt, the Times said. It said there was no indication Gadhafi
intended to turn Abu Nidal over to Egypt.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies except the Canadian dollar and the British pound in
light European trading, dealers said today.
   Gold and silver prices were sharply lower as profit taking
continued in the wake of last week's steep rise, bullion dealers
said.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's rise is only a pause in a
downward trend. They said the U.S. currency is under pressure from
confusion caused by the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate policy
and the bullish impact of East European reforms on the West German
mark.
   The pound moved higher after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
reiterated her determination to remain head of the Conservative
Party.
   Traders said the markets will be watching Wednesday's scheduled
release of preliminary third quarter U.S. gross national product
figures. If the figures reflecting economic growth are lower,
dealers said the Federal Reserve could drop interest rates which
would weaken the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 143.65 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.7965 West German marks, up from 1.7900
   _1.6060 Swiss francs, up from 1.6050
   _6.1310 French francs, up from 6.1125
   _2.0260 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0203
   _1,324.75 Italian lire, up from 1,321.25
   _1.1667 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1670
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5633 to buy one pound, more expensive for buyers than $1.5605
late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.70 a troy ounce,
down from $414.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $410.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $409.10, down from $414 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $8.83 to close at a bid $409.19.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.62 a troy ounce, down
from Monday's $5.73.

<TEXT>
   People who have chunks of the Berlin Wall
may be carrying more than a piece of history. They may be carrying
asbestos, a state health official says.
   When a German student at the University of Oklahoma returned
from a holiday trip to his homeland with two small pieces of the
wall, his host family saw what they believed was asbestos on one of
the chunks.
   They took it to the department where tests showed about 75
percent of it was filled with chrysotile-asbestos, said John Feero,
laboratory supervisor of the department's asbestos program.
   Chrysotile-asbestos was commonly used in building materials,
Feero said.
   Whether the entire Berlin Wall contains the cancer-causing
substance is unknown. The asbestos material could be isolated to
just the piece examined by state officials, Feero said.
   He said the risk of harm is slight, but any piece of the wall
with asbestos should be kept in a sealed container.
   ``The danger is minuscule but it's still not something that
should be transported all over the place without proper
precautions,'' Feero said ``You probably wouldn't want it sitting
in the open.''
   In the piece examined by state officials, the asbestos fibers
were imbedded in the matrix, he said. Only by chipping, crushing or
breaking it would those fibers be released into the air, Feero said.

<HEAD>Officials Explain Why No Blood Test Taken After Exxon Oil Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state official called to the wreck of
the Exxon Valdez said he wasn't prepared to take an immediate blood
alcohol test of Joseph Hazelwood because he was unaware a crime had
been committed.
   The blood test wasn't made until about 10 hours after the
grounding, too late, Hazelwood's defense attorneys claim, to prove
anything about his sobriety when the Exxon Valdez ran on a reef and
caused the nation's most disastrous oil spill.
   The testimony came Monday at a hearing where Hazelwood's lawyers
sought to get charges against him dismissed. In addition to
questioning the sobriety test, the attorneys claim Hazelwood
automatically received immunity from prosecution when he reported
the oil spill.
   Exxon fired Hazelwood soon after the March 24 wreck, which
spilled about 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William
Sound. Hazelwood, the tanker captain, was below decks when the
wreck occurred and a subordinate was at the helm.
   Assistant District Attorney Leonard Linton Jr. said discovery of
the huge spill was inevitable.
   Hazelwood, 43, a veteran mariner from Huntington, N.Y., is
scheduled for trial Jan. 22 on charges of reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil, all misdemeanors, and three felony counts of criminal mischief.
   He faces a possible maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and
$100,000 in fines.
   Alaska Fish and Wildlife Protection Trooper Michael Fox said he
was called by the Coast Guard to the Exxon Valdez and assumed he
was wanted to help ``deal with a drunken sailor.''
   ``I got up onto the bridge fully expecting to have to deal with
a drunk-type situation, and it wasn't that at all,'' he said. ``It
was a very sad, quiet-type situation.''
   Fox said he was asked to obtain a blood sample, but wasn't
prepared to do so without evidence of a crime.
   Fox said he asked what caused the tanker wreck and Hazelwood
told him: ``You're looking at it.''
   Mark Delozier, a former Coast Guard investigator in Valdez, said
Capt. Hazelwood smelled strongly of alcohol, but Fox apparently
hadn't been informed about the need for blood samples.
   Expecting unruliness, Fox was carrying a gun and handcuffs when
he came aboard the Valdez, Delozier said.

<HEAD>Red Flare Keeps Hope Alive of Finding Missing Lobstermen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers searched with renewed hope today after a
red distress flare lighted the night sky off Martha's Vineyard,
where five lobstermen have been missing for nearly a week.
   ``It's almost exactly where we would expect it to be,'' said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Ken Arbogast.
   Two Coast Guard cutters circled a 25-square-mile area 200 miles
offshore this morning. The search for the 72-foot Heidi Marie also
has involved as many as five jets.
   The steel-hulled lobster boat out of Stonington, Conn., was
listed as missing Wednesday after its five-man crew failed to call
the boat's owner.
   The search intensified Monday after three white flares appeared
in 12 hours and again this morning after the sighting of the red
flare about 8 p.m. White flares usually aren't an emergency beacon,
but a red flare is the universal distress signal.
   Whoever lighted the flare could be anywhere from 6 to 30 miles
from where it was seen, Arbogast said.

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy today laid two white
lilies at the site of his brother's famous 1963 speech and said the
opening of the Berlin Wall was one of the strongest symbols of
liberty in modern times.
   Several hundred people gathered for the ceremony on the steps of
Schoeneberg City Hall. About a dozen protesters opposed to U.S.
policies in El Salvador hurled wreaths and black crosses in
Kennedy's direction and police quickly took them away.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., ignored the protesters as he placed the lilies
at the site where President John F. Kennedy declared, ``Ich bin ein
Berliner,'' which means ``I am a Berliner.''
   The speech on June 26, 1963, to 400,000 cheering Berliners was
one of Kennedy's most electric moments in office.
   He was assassinated in Dallas five months later and West Berlin
honored his memory with a plaque at city hall.
   Sen. Kennedy said in a speech inside city hall that he had come
to Berlin ``on behalf of my family and country, on a journey of
memory and hope.
   ``The proudest boast is `Ich bin ein Berliner.'''
   He was welcomed by the mayor of West Berlin, Walter Momper, and
former chancellor Willy Brandt, who was mayor when the wall was
erected on Aug. 13, 1961. Later, his motorcade drove through
Checkpoint Charlie into East Berlin.
   Kennedy described the Nov. 9 opening of the Berlin Wall as
representing ``the greatest march of liberty in modern times, and
perhaps of all time.''
   ``I only wish that President Kennedy could have come here
himself to see this new day that is beginning,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The government today fired Christian
leader Michel Aoun as army commander, but thousands of his
supporters formed a human shield around the presidential palace to
defend him from a feared Syrian attack.
   Gen. Aoun, who commands 20,000 mainly Christian troops, pledged
Monday to ``die fighting'' rather than surrender to President Elias
Hrawi's government or the 40,000 troops that Syria has in Lebanon.
Aoun rejected Parliament's election of Hrawi last week and refused
his earlier order to step down.
   Defense Minister Albert Mansour told reporters in
Syrian-occupied eastern Lebanon that Adm. Emile Lahoud, former navy
commander, was now armed forces chief. Mansour warned that officers
and men who stayed loyal to Aoun would be dismissed.
   It was not immediately known how many of Aoun's troops will
remain loyal to him as Lebanon was poised on the brink of another
round of fighting.
   The government move came three days after Hrawi, elected
president by parliament Friday, dismissed Aoun as head of an
interim military government.
   Near the presidential palace in the Beirut suburb of Baalbek,
youths started hundreds of small fires that could be observed
glowing in the pine woods from several parts of Lebanon.
   ``They are telling whoever wants to attack the general that
civilians have to be killed first,'' said a police spokesman, who
cannot be named in line with regulations.
   Aoun had predicted Syria, which backs Hrawi, might try to kill
him in an air raid. Fears of renewed fighting also sparked panic
buying in Beirut as residents rushed to stock underground shelters.
   Witnesses said church bells tolled all night in the Christian
enclave north of Beirut as youths headed to Baabda to declare
support for Aoun. Hundreds more joined the crowd throughout the day.
   ``Many of us slept in cars in the palace's yard,'' said Michel
Hayek, a university student.
   ``We were singing the national anthem all night. The general is
the symbol of our independence. If the Syrians want to kill him,
they'll have to kill us first,'' Hayek said.
   Aoun has termed Hrawi's election unconstitutional and aides said
he was determined to remain entrenched in the bunker of the
presidential palace. He had no immediate comment today to the
government action.
   President Amin Gemayel named Aoun as head of an interim military
government in September 1988 when Gemayel's six-year term ended
with Parliament unable to elect a successor. Moslems and Syrians
rejected Aoun's government.
   On Nov. 5, Parliament elected Rene Mouawad as president of a
national unity government, but he was assassinated 17 days later.
Hrawi was elected Friday to replace him.
   Hrawi, a Maronite like Aoun, also said he was determined to rule
from Baabda, traditional seat of Lebanon's presidents, ``even if it
is one room.''
   In Damascus, the al-Baath newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling
Baath Party, called Aoun an obstacle to Lebanese unity ``that must
be terminated.''
   Aoun told a news conference at the palace bunker Monday that
Hrawi ``has no forces of his own to fight me with. He will have to
rely on Syria's occupation forces.''
   Aoun noted that the Syrians ``have the means to attack me from
the air. They might use that means. I might be killed in such an
air attack.''
   Police said thousands of people have fled Beirut to safer areas
in south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa valley and the northeastern
mountains in case hostilities erupt again.
   However, police and Moslem army officers reported no troop
movements.
   By police count, 930 people were killed and 2,744 wounded in six
months of clashes pitting Aoun's mainly Christian troops against
Syrian and allied forces before an Arab mediation committee
succeeded in enforcing a cease-fire Sept. 22.
   Parliament last month forged a new power-sharing formula between
Christians and Moslems that Hrawi has pledged to implement.
   But Aoun rejected the accord because it did not specify when
Syria's 40,000 troops, in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, would withdraw.

   The Communist premier met with
opposition leaders today and promised to push for a coalition
government and elimination of the Communists' 40-year monopoly on
power, a federal minister said.
   Ladislav Adamec met for two hours with members of the Civic
Forum group, who were fortified by a nationwide demonstration
Monday against authoritarian rule that saw millions of people pack
city centers.
   Today, after 11 straight days of huge pro-democracy rallies,
cities were quiet as Civic Forum said it was time to take the fight
off the streets and to the negotiating table.
   Marian Calfa, a federal government minister who was at the
meeting, told reporters Adamec agreed to ask President Gustav Husak
to appoint a new government that will include ``non-party
representatives, representatives of other political parties, and
Communists.''
   Calfa said the new Cabinet would be made up largely of ``experts
and professionals'' and did not say if opposition leaders would
have a place in it.
   He also said the federal government would propose to Parliament
constitutional changes that would eliminate provisions guaranteeing
the Communist Party a leading role.
   Requirements that education must be on Marxist-Leninist lines
also must be dropped, Calfa said, and the government will ask that
provisions binding allied political parties to the Communists be
dropped from the constitution.
   Until now, these parties have been docile allies of the
Communists. In recent weeks, however, they have played a much more
independent role, with the Socialist Party playing the most
prominent part.
   Prague city authorities will be instructed to provide Civic
Forum, which has been operating out of makeshift headquarters in
striking theaters and art galleries around the capital, with
premises for their activities, Calfa said.
   ``Some results have been achieved,'' said Civic Forum delegate
Jan Carnogursky as he left the meeting, but he refused to give
details.
   Before the talks began, Civic Forum spokesman Vaclav Klaus said
the opposition intended to offer Adamec the choice of creating a
coalition government or facing opposition calls for his resignation.
   Such calls already have led to the ouster of Communist Party
chief Milos Jakes and several on the ruling Politburo who had
resisted the East bloc reforms introduced by Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   In further signs the Communist Party is moving to accommodate
opposition demands, Jakes today resigned from his position as head
of the national Defense Council, and the head of the federal
Parliament, Alois Indra, also stepped down.
   Jakes and Indra were among the hard-liners who lost their
Politburo seats in a leadership shake-up Friday.
   Monday's two-hour nationwide general strike _ a festive affair
of speeches, song and flag-waving _ was the largest public display
of opposition to the ruling Communists since they took power in
1948.
   Opposition leaders held out the threat of further strikes if the
popular will was not heeded. Any doubt that workers backed the
pro-democracy movement was erased on Monday as shop floors across
the country were idled.
   Civic Forum said the strike committees that put together
Monday's well-orchestrated protest would be left on permanent alert
if the need arose to organize another strike.
   Speaking at a rally in Prague on Monday night, Civic Forum
spokesman Vaclav Klaus called off further rallies and strikes
pending the outcome of today's meeting.
   On Monday, huge crowds of workers gathered in Bratislava, the
east Slovak industrial center of Kosice, the mining center of
Ostrava on the Polish border, and in Usti nad Labem, the heart of
industrial north Bohemia.
   Crowds chanted ``Dubcek to the Castle!'' referring to Alexander
Dubcek, the ousted leader of the failed Prague Spring reforms that
were crushed in August 1968 by Soviet tanks.
   Dubcek has returned from political obscurity to address crowds
for four days running in Prague and his native Bratislava.
   Jakes and others dropped from the Politburo were associated with
the repression that followed the Soviet-led invasion. He was
replaced by Karel Urbanek, who was shown on state television
meeting with a group of workers.
   Battling to regain control as the remnants of power slip from
their grasp, Communist authorities announced new concessions
Monday:.
   _ Deputy premier Jaromir Zak said a new draft of the
constitution would delete the article that declares the Communist
Party the country's leading political force.
   _ The party's policy-making Central Committee approved an
inquiry by a parliamentary commission into the brutal crackdown on
a Nov. 17 rally in which riot police clubbed hundreds of peaceful
demonstrators.
   _ The Czech and Slovak ministries of culture said they had
partially lifted censorship.
   _ Vladimir Janku, head of the state's church affairs office, was
quoted by the official CTK news agency as promising an end to the
state's tight control of churches and saying the state would no
longer issue licenses for priests.
   Also Monday, five Old Guard members of the Slovak Communist
Party's Politburo were ousted and replaced by largely unknown
people, the state news agency CTK reported today.

   Discovery's astronauts returned
home under cover of darkness today after ending their secret
mission with a sunset landing at a desert air base where gusts
twice delayed the return to Earth.
   A news blackout imposed by the military prevented the astronauts
from talking about what they did during their five-day mission, but
Commander Frederick Gregory did comment on one problem _ a
malfunctioning toilet.
   ``The crew performed, I think, flawlessly. Discovery's toilet
didn't work, but we fixed it,'' said Gregory, who was wearing a
slipper on one foot and shoe on the other. He suffered a foot
infection while in orbit, NASA said.
   Meanwhile, shuttle Columbia was moved to a launch pad at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., today for a 10-day, Christmastime flight during
which it will put one satellite in orbit and retrieve another that
is falling to Earth.
   After staying in space an extra day and then an extra orbit
because of high winds, Discovery landed at 4:30 p.m. PST Monday at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``With the sun glinting off the underside of the vehicle, it was
really a pretty landing,'' NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said.
   The astronauts, who reportedly released a spy satellite, arrived
at their home base here today before dawn, a fitting finale to
their hush-hush flight. Despite showers, about 30 people greeted
the astronauts at Ellington Field.
   Gregory, the first black to command a shuttle flight, called the
mission a success.
   ``We did what we were supposed to do. And we did it right and we
even got a day yesterday to relax and take thousands of pictures,
literally,'' he said.
   ``We had a near perfect vehicle,'' added mission specialist
Story Musgrave.
   The other crew members were pilot John Blaha and mission
specialists Manley Carter Jr. and Kathryn Thornton.
   Discovery originally was scheduled to land Sunday, but had to
wait a day because of high winds that sent ``dust devils'' whipping
across Edwards.
   Mission Control rescheduled the return for Monday afternoon, but
winds forced another delay. The winds were not as strong as the 30
mph gusts reported Sunday, but were high enough to make conditions
unacceptable for the planned 2:52 p.m. PST landing.
   Since conditions looked better for landing late in the
afternoon, controllers directed the astronauts to stay aloft
another 89 minutes for one more spin around the globe. As
predicted, the winds subsided and NASA gave the go-ahead to begin
the fiery dash through the astmosphere.
   Forty-five minutes before landing, Mission Control directed
Gregory, an Air Force colonel, to shift to the concrete runway from
a hard clay runway because of more favorable winds. The shuttle
landed in light crosswinds of 4 mph and a headwind of about 19 mph.
   About four hours after touchdown, the crew addressed about 60
friends and NASA workers at Edwards before boarding jets for
Houston. Gregory did not explain why he came out wearing a
salmon-colored slipper on his right foot and a brown shoe on the
left.
   ``One of the things that you learn when you go in space is that
you don't have to wear the same kind of shoes when you come out,''
he said.
   Johnson Space Center spokesman Kyle Herring said Gregory got a
foot infection while in orbit, but it had no effect on the mission.
Herring said the infection was being evaluated, and he did not have
any other details.
   The astronauts have today off but they will report back to work
Wednesday at the Johnson Space Center to begin briefings about
their flight.
   Sources close to the project have said the astronauts achieved
their main goal Thursday, a day after liftoff, when they released a
2{-ton, $300 million satellite designed to eavesdrop on
communications in the Soviet Union, Europe, Africa and the Middle
East.
   The crew also reportedly conducted experiments related to the
``Star Wars'' missile defense system.

   A centrist opposition alliance today won
pledges of support from the right and left and said it was ready to
oust Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and form India's first minority
government since independence.
   Gandhi's Congress Party in turn said it was willing to step
aside and become the opposition.
   ``We have not got a majority. That is the verdict of the
people,'' party spokesman Anand Sharma said.
   Gandhi's party won more Parliament seats than the National Front
in elections that ended Sunday, but neither group has enough for a
majority.
   ``The mandate in this election is unmistakably a mandate for a
change of government,'' the National Front said in a statement read
by its spokesman, Dinesh Goswamy, as the leaders of the five-party
alliance met.
   ``The people of India want a non-Congress government to replace
the corrupt and inefficient Congress government. It is therefore
the sacred duty of the National Front to respect this mandate and
to express its readiness to form a government,'' the statement said.
   The National Front said a meeting will be held Wednesday to
select the five-party alliance's candidate for the next prime
minister of India, the world's most populous democracy.
   The front's strategy was to opt for a minority government with
the tacit support of an array of parties ranging from communists to
Hindu nationalists.
   The front's leader, former Gandhi ally Vishwanath Pratap Singh,
met with leaders of the Communist Party-Marxist, who said they
would support the National Front as long as it did not create a
formal coalition with the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party.
   Smaller Communist and leftist groups also offered support with
the same conditions, Indian news agencies said. The Bharatiya
Janata said Monday it would support the National Front without
entering into a binding coalition.
   The elections for Parliament's policy-making lower house began
Wednesday and ended Sunday.
   With 451 of the 525 contested seats declared, the Congress Party
and its small-party allies had 197 seats, state-run television
reported.
   The National Front had 102 seats, the television said, citing
tallies from the Election Commission. The Bharatiya Janata had 77.
The assorted communist and leftist parties had 44 seats, and
smaller parties and independents won the rest.
   The seats for which results have not been announced are in areas
where the National Front is expected to do well.
   In forming a government, the front could be hard-pressed to
preserve an ideologically diverse governing coalition.
   Gandhi, a caretaker prime minister since Parliament dissolved
Monday night, apparently hoped that deep divisions will cripple the
effort, and he appeared ready to sit tight and await such a
conclusion.
   The Congress Party has governed India for all but 29 months
since independence from British rule in 1947.
   Gandhi was swept into office in December 1984 with an
unprecedented 415 of the 543 seats in the lower house on a wave of
sympathy generated by the assassination two months earlier of his
mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   But Rajiv Gandhi's support waned after allegations of corruption
were made against his government, mostly over newspaper reports
that the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid kickbacks to win
a $1.4 billion government contract in 1986.
   While Parliament has 543 elected seats, only 525 were filled in
this month's elections. Balloting for other seats has been
postponed indefinitely because of incomplete voter lists and
candidates' deaths.

<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France today exploded one of its
largest underground nuclear devices in the South Pacific, drawing a
sharp reaction from New Zealand.
   The test, the eighth this year, was measured at 90 kilotons _
the equivalent of 90,000 tons of TNT _ and New Zealand Prime
Minister Geoffrey Palmer vowed to continue his efforts to end the
program.
   France has detonated 111 nuclear devices in the South Pacific
since 1975 despite growing regional opposition. The blast was
monitored at Raratonga, Cook Islands, by a New Zealand
seismological station.
   Palmer condemned the test, saying his labor government would
continue to urge a halt of the weapons' testing program in French
Polynesia. He dismissed French arguments that the program was
needed to maintain a deterrent force and guarantee its national
security.
   Warwick Smith, head of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research which monitors seismic activity, said it was
France's biggest blast this year and second only to a 115-kiloton
explosion on July 25, 1979.
   France two years ago began using Fangataufa atoll for its bigger
tests. It normally uses Mururoa atoll, 800 miles south. Both atolls
are east of Tahiti, or roughly midway between Australia and Chile.

   A retarded AIDS victim whose adoptive mother
successfully challenged a judge's ruling that the youngster attend
class in a glass booth has died of the disease. She was 8.
   Eliana Martinez, who contracted AIDS as an infant from a tainted
blood transfusion, died in her mother's arms at home Monday
evening, surrounded by family members and friends.
   ``She died like she lived _ fighting every inch of the way,''
said her mother, Rosa Martinez. ``She opened her eyes and looked
right at me. Then she closed them and she died.''
   Eliana had been monitored around the clock since a brush with
death three weeks ago from a feeding-tube infection
   ``She never snapped back from that,'' said Dan McClowry,
Eliana's former speech therapist and a friend of the family. ``She
had been in and out of a coma for the last three days ... running a
fever of up to 105 with an accelerated heartbeat.''
   Mrs. Martinez adopted the girl as an 11-month-old child
abandoned in a Puerto Rico hospital.
   Mrs. Martinez, a licensed practical nurse, once said of Eliana:
``She was deprived of family and we became that. She was deprived
of health and we gave her the best medical attention she could.''
And finally, she saw to it Eliana wouldn't be deprived of an
education.
   Hillsborough County School Board officials had wanted the child
kept home, fearing she posed a health risk. A judge ruled Eliana
could attend school if she stayed inside a special glass booth.
   But Mrs. Martinez said she wouldn't send her daughter to class
under such conditions. Her attorney appealed and won. In April,
Eliana went to school for children with special needs, without the
enclosure.
   Mrs. Martinez, her 20-year-old son, Joseph, and a few family
friends and caretakers had been sitting up with the child for the
last few days knowing death was near, McClowry said.
   Eliana's body was to be taken today to the National Institutes
of Health in Bethesda, Md., for an autopsy, said McClowry. The
funeral will be next week in Tampa.
   Doctors took Eliana off the experimental AIDS-fighting drug DDI
on Oct. 4, saying it wasn't protecting her from life-threatening
infections. Eliana had been given AZT, the only federally approved
AIDS drug, for two years and was switched when it was no longer
helping her.
   Mrs. Martinez, 37, adopted Eliana in her native Puerto Rico
after responding to a radio appeal for the homeless child. Eliana
weighed only about 10 pounds when Mrs. Martinez took her home.
   At first, doctors thought the baby might have cerebral palsy.
   It wasn't until the spring of 1985 that Mrs. Martinez and her
husband, Jose, learned Eliana had AIDS-related complex or ARC, a
precursor to AIDS.

<HEAD>Minister's Announcement Of New Communist Concessions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Czechoslovakia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, as translated by The
Associated Press, is the announcement by Communist minister without
portfolio Marian Calfa on the creation of a coalition government:
   The negotiations of the Civic Forum and the delegation of the
National Front and the federal government lasted two hours, with
two breaks. The introduction to the negotiations took place in a
rather excited atmosphere, especially because opinions were
exchanged on the situation ... and the approach was not identical.
   After an exhaustive exchange of opinions, the delegation of the
National Front and the federal government acceded to a constructive
agreement and accepted the following conclusions.
   I will inform you only about those conclusions which the federal
government can fulfil according to its position in the constitution
of the Czechoslovak Socialist republic.
   The premier promised that by Dec. 3, 1989, he will ask the
president to appoint a new government. This government should be
based on a broad coalition representing non-party members, other
political parties and naturally the Communist Party of
Czechoslovakia.
   It will be a government constituted primarily of experts and
professionals.
   The federal government will use its constitutional authority to
propose new laws and will suggest to the Federal Assembly
(Parliament) changes in the Czechoslovak constitution in three
articles:
   No. 1, dropping the clause guaranteeing the leading role of the
Communist Party, so far included (in the constitution);
   Leaving out a clause about the closed character of the National
Front and the leading role of the Communist Party in it (The
National Front is a Communist-dominated umbrella organization of
all political parties and social groups permitted in
Czechoslovakia);
   Leaving out the clause stipulating education in the spirit of
Marxism-Leninism. This concept will be replaced by a concept of
education based on scientific knowledge and the principles of
humanitarianism.
   The Premier promised he would ask the National Committee of
Prague (Prague local government) to provide the necessary premises
for the Civic Forum to carry out its activities.
   The original excited atmosphere has turned during the talks into
a constructive atmosphere in a mutual endeavor to find ways out of
the present political situation.

<TEXT>
   The office of District of Columbia Mayor
Marion Barry is branding as ``character assassination'' a televised
report that Barry was hospitalized for treatment of a drug overdose
in 1983.
   WUSA-TV said Monday that it had obtained a police report quoting
a Howard University Hospital physician as saying Barry was
hospitalized for a drug overdose.
   Psychiatrist Alyce Gullattee, who directs the hospital's
Institute of Drug Abuse and Addiction, was interviewed twice by
police investigators in June 1984, the station said.
   ``When Mayor Marion Barry was hospitalized ... his illness was
the result of an overdose of drugs (cocaine) that occurred while he
was in the company of a female companion who also overdosed,''
Gullattee told police, according to the report.
   ``Barry overdosed a second time; however, he was taken to the
District of Columbia General Hospital for treatment,'' she was
quoted as saying.
   The station did not say how Gullattee would know about treatment
for a drug overdose at another hospital.
   Barry was taken to Howard University Hospital by ambulance Sept.
23, 1983, complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath after
a party with friends at a Washington hotel.
   Initially, doctors feared the mayor had suffered a heart attack,
but a mayoral spokesman later told reporters that Barry had been
hospitalized for a hiatal hernia, an abnormality of the digestive
tract where part of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm.
   WUSA-TV did not say whether Gullattee was involved in the
mayor's treatment. Gullattee declined repeated attempts Monday for
an interview.
   The mayor has acknowledged being hospitalized at D.C. General
twice after his release from Howard. But Barry said on all three
occasions that he was treated for his hernia problem, not cocaine
abuse.
   At least two people have said they provided drugs for the mayor.
The U.S. attorney's office has investigated, but no drug charges
have been brought against him.
   The station said the police report of the Gullattee interview
was never given to the U.S. attorney's office.
   The Washington Times today quoted sources as saying Barry was
hospitalized two more times for drugs _ once at a Washington
hospital on an undisclosed date and in January 1987 while he was in
Los Angeles to attend the Super Bowl.
   Barry was out of town Monday, but his office called the
allegations an ``outrageous character assassination'' and said his
medical records reveal he did not overdose on drugs.
   Dr. Vincent Roux, the mayor's personal physician, said Gullattee
did not treat Barry and has no knowledge of his condition. Roux
said he had no way of knowing whether the mayor overdosed on
cocaine.
   Former Police Chief Maurice Turner, who is expected to run
against Barry, confirmed that Gullattee made the allegations,
WUSA-TV said.
   One of the two lieutenants who spoke with the doctor declined to
comment and the other could not be reached, the station said.

<HEAD>Embattled Nominee Given New Title in Nuclear Arms Office</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's embattled nominee to head the
nation's nuclear weapons production will take a lower-ranking post
in the arms program until the Senate acts on the nomination early
next year, the Energy Department said today.
   The decision to appoint Victor Stello Jr. as principal deputy
assistant secretary for defense programs suggested that Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins is committed to trying to overcome
Senate opposition to the nomination.
   The new appointment does not require Senate confirmation.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee held two days of hearings on
Stello's nomination as assistant secretary for defense programs
earlier this month, then decided not to act on the matter until
after Congress reconvenes in January. The panel held open the
possibility that Stello would be asked to testify again.
   The job for which Stello was nominated last July is responsible
for managing nuclear weapons production at 17 major plants and
laboratories in 12 states. Part of the production complex is shut
down for safety and mechanical upgrades.
   In a memorandum to managers of the nuclear weapons program,
Under Secretary John Tuck announced that Stello would be his main
deputy for an ``interim period'' pending Senate action, which he
said was likely shortly after Congress returns.
   Tuck said he was confident the new appointment ``will enable
defense programs to more readily meet the wide range of demands
facing the nuclear weapons complex in the foreseeable future.''
   Stello has been working as an adviser to Watkins on nuclear
weapons issues since his nomination was announced last July. During
this period he has been on loan to the department from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, where he held the title of executive
director for operations, the top-ranking executive post.
   Joseph Fouchard, an NRC spokesman, said Stello gave up his
commission job as of Monday. Stello worked for the NRC and its
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, for 24 years as a
regulator of commercial nuclear power plants.

   A commuter train plowed into
a bus that became stuck on the tracks because of a rush-hour
traffic jam, killing two ABC-TV executives heading to a National
Football League game.
   The six other people on the chartered bus Monday night were
injured, but only the driver was hospitalized, officials said. No
injuries were reported among people on the train, which was moving
at 60 mph but did not derail.
   Police said an officer's earlier report that as many as 25
people were injured was wrong.
   The bus was part of a convoy of four vehicles carrying network
employees and their clients to Candlestick Park to watch the San
Francisco 49ers play the New York Giants as part of ABC's
celebration of the 20th anniversary of Monday Night Football.
   The bus had driven onto the tracks at a crossing five miles
south of San Francisco and came to a stop behind a tractor-trailer,
said Officer Greg Hart.
   ``The gates came down and the bus was stuck,'' said Hart. ``The
driver tried to get around and honked his horn several times to
clear traffic.
   ``It's just a question of getting caught in a situation where
you're in between the arms.''
   The driver volunteered to take drug and alcohol tests, Sgt. Mike
Guglielmoni said.
   Police said Kurt Michael Sanger of New York, marketing director
for ABC-TV sports, and Adele H. Roffis, of Culver City, Calif., a
network sales executive, were killed. Roffis was 61 and Sanger
about 50, said Officer Elizabeth Helmer.
   The ABC employees and guests had taken a cruise on San Francisco
Bay and were headed to the stadium to watch the game, said Bob
Wheeler, manager of sports information for ABC.
   John Sanchez, the driver of the truck ahead of the bus, said he
saw the bus pull up behind him and get stuck on the tracks. When he
heard the train blowing its whistle, he pulled as far forward as he
could.
   ``I heard the engineer blowing the whistle, long and loud,
looked in the rear view mirror and then I heard the sound of metal
scraping,'' he said. ``I saw the bus spun around and hit by the
train.''
   The bus was hit at the rear and spun around 180 degrees. A front
wheel landed back on the track with the rear wheel in a shallow
ditch, Sanchez said.
   Hart said the two people who died were thrown into the track
area.
   The bus driver, Paul Cang, 33, was in stable condition in the
intensive care unit of Peninsula Hospital in nearby Burlingame.
   Five other people were treated at hospitals and released.
   The CalTrain commuter service runs from San Francisco to San
Jose and is operated by Southern Pacific Railroad.
   Railroad spokesman Bob Hoppe said the train was traveling at 60
mph when the collision occurred. Passengers remained on the train
and service was halted in both directions for 90 minutes.
   The bus is owned by San Francisco-based International Coach,
said Daniel Coles, operations manager for the bus company.

<HEAD>U.S. Trade Gap Edged Up $200 Million in Summer Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit edged up $200 million
to $27.75 billion from July through October after declining in the
two previous quarters, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit showed a 0.7 percent
increase from the April-June quarter, when the gap totaled $27.55
billion.
   The net increase resulted from a 0.2 percent advance in exports,
which climbed to record $91.57 billion, and a 0.3 percent increase
in imports, which rose to a record $119.32 billion.
   Both exports and imports were at record levels for the fifth
consecutive quarter.
   The second-quarter deficit, the difference between imports and
exports, had been the lowest since a $25.7 billion imbalance in the
first quarter of 1985.
   For the first nine months of the year, the deficit was running
at an annual rate of $111.6 billion, down 12.3 percent from the
$127.2 billion trade gap registered in all of 1988.
   The imbalance narrowed 11.4 percent to $28.38 billion in the
first quarter and declined a further 2.9 percent to $27.55 billion
in the second.
   The report was a bit higher than expected because earlier
monthly Commerce reports on merchandise trade indicated a small
improvement.
   Some analysts and Bush administration officials have questioned
whether the deficit can continue to improve substantially in the
months ahead.
   Some say that exports, which have been propped up by prosperous
overseas economies, will continue to be hampered by the relatively
high value of the dollar. At the same time, imports continue to be
relatively strong.
   A stronger dollar makes American goods more expensive and thus
less competitive on overseas markets, while making imported goods
cheaper and thus more attractive to American consumers.
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford also said after Commerce
reported the September deficit improvement that further shrinkage
could stall by next year unless the United States and its major
trading partners do a better job of coordinating their economic
policies.
   The administration has based its predictions of healthy economic
growth partly on the belief that exports would keep expanding.
   Today's report on merchandise trade, which is calculated on a
balance of payment basis, is slightly different from the
improvement already noted in the Commerce Department's monthly
merchandise trade reports.
   Today's report excludes U.S. military sales to foreign
governments and makes other minor adjustments in the monthly
figures.
   In the third quarter, non-farm exports increased $1.2 billion,
or 2 percent, to a record $81.8 billion. The sector was boosted by
shipments of capital goods, including aircraft and parts to Western
Europe, Japan and newly industrialized countries in the Far East.
   Shipments of non-farm products such as industrial supplies and
materials and automotive parts fell. Farm products also fell, down
10 percent to $9.8 billion.
   Consumer goods, including clothing and household goods, led the
increase in imports. Imports of industrial suplies and materials
fell while both capital goods and automotive products were
virtually unchanged.
   Oil imports decreased 1 percent to $13.3 billion, due to lower
prices. The average prices per barrel fell to $16.85 from $18.46
during the quarter, while the average number of barrels imported
daily increased to 8.65 million _ the highest level since the third
quarter of 1977 _ from 7.97 million.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today announced
a plan to draw the two Germanys into an informal confederation that
eventually would lead to reunification. West Germany's major
opposition party also called for unity.
   In East Germany, a Communist newspaper warned that society could
collapse unless authorities stem emigration and punish corrupt
officials. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in five cities
Monday night in what has become a weekly ritual to maintain
pressure on the ruling Communists to enact reforms.
   One of the biggest cheers among the 200,000 demonstrators in
Leipzig came when a speaker urged a referendum on German unity.
   East Germany's leaders oppose reunification, but a proposed
confederation is being discussed. The government in East Berlin was
expected to issue a statement on Kohl's remarks later today.
   Kohl's 30-minute address to Parliament was the most thorough
delineation of his vision of eliminating the partition imposed at
the end of World War II.
   In a 10-point plan, he proposed taking steps to ``develop
confederative structures between the two states in Germany in order
to create a federation, a federal order.''
   He stressed, however, that such measures could only be
undertaken if there are free elections in East Germany that include
non-socialist parties. East Germany's new Communist leaders have
said such elections could be held as early as next fall.
   Kohl also said steps toward German reunification must be linked
to improved East-West relations and a new European order based on
cooperation, economic integration and greater freedom of movement.
   ``The future structure of Germany must fit into the whole
architecture of Europe as a whole,'' he said.
   Kohl suggested the creation of consultative committees with East
Germany, including a joint parliamantary panel.
   ``Such a coming together is in the interest of the continuation
of German history,'' Kohl said.
   Earlier, Hans-Jochen Vogel, the leader of the opposition Social
Democrats, proposed a confederation between the German states as an
interim step toward unity. He also insisted German unity come as
part of the process of overall European integration.
   Vogel used the word ``unity'' rather than formal
``reunification'' in his speech to Parliament.
   In the past, the Social Democrats have cautioned against
hastening toward reunification, and some in the leftist party have
opposed it.
   The ZDF television network said Kohl gave no dates for the
completion of his plan in an earlier talk with governing party
lawmakers. Kohl has previously said he envisions a reunited Germany
existing peacefully with its neighbors and other countries.
   The newspaper Bild said Kohl's plan includes setting up joint
committees to coordinate cooperation in economic matters, crime
prevention, ecology and other domestic areas, while ``leaving
membership to NATO and the Warsaw Pact untouched.''
   Government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl may travel to East
Germany on Dec. 19 for talks on his proposals. Leaders of both
Germanys are under pressure to keep the reunification option open.
   At the Leipzig rally, placards said ``Germany United _
Fatherland,'' and at one point some demonstrators chanted the
slogan. Another banner read, ``The Goal _ One Germany.''
   One of the biggest cheers came when a worker, Helmut Neubert,
called for a referendum on German reunification.
   ``The fundamental question of reunification cannot be only a
matter for politicans. The people must decide whether they want
it,'' he said.
   West Germany's ultra-rightist Republican party issued an
election platform Monday calling for a reunited Germany that would
include territory lost in World War II.
   Such calls deeply disturb Poland, where most of that territory
is located, and Kohl has sought to reassure the Poles that a
reunified Germany would have no designs on those lands.
   In addition to the Leipzig protest, tens of thousands of
protesters took to the streets Monday night in Dresden and Halle,
while 10,000 people protested in the city of Schwerin, the official
East German news agency ADN said.
   Under the pressure of a public demanding an end to 40 years of
authoritarian one-party rule, East Germany has undergone dizzying
changes since party chief Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 and
replaced by Egon Krenz.
   On Nov. 9, the Berlin Wall was opened and East Germans were
allowed to travel freely for the first time.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy today placed two white lilies at the city
hall site of his brother's dramatic 1963 speech. President Kennedy
said at the time, ``Ich bin ein Berliner,'' as a measure of
solidarity with residents of the divided city.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., said the opening of the wall sparked ``the
greatest march of liberty in modern times.'' He later visited East
Berlin.
   A front-page editorial in Berliner Zeitung, a Communist Party
newspaper, called for more action to punish suspected widespread
corruption under the leadership of ousted party chief Erich
Honecker.
   ``Every day that goes by without true signs (of such action)
being given leads toward the collapse of society,'' the editorial
said.

   The Justice Department is trying to determine
if an American church woman accused by El Salvador's government of
storing weapons for rebels violated U.S. law, an official said
today.
   Friends of Jennifer J. Casolo say the woman was framed by
Salvadoran authorities. But the department is reviewing the case to
determine if she violated the Neutrality Act, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The seldom-invoked law bars private citizens from taking sides
in foreign wars.
   The official, confirming a report in today's editions of the Los
Angeles Times, stressed that the department was not conducting a
formal investigation but said the FBI was reviewing the
circumstances with prosecutors to determine if a legal violation
existed.
   Casolo, 28, was arrested Saturday and Salvadoran police
confiscated tons of ammunition buried in the garden of her home.
They said the arms were stored there by guerrillas. Casolo had
rented the house for three months with a roommate who left the
country the morning before the raid.
   Acquaintances, including the brother of Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd, D-Conn., said the church activist was the victim of a grudge
in a country ``where a grudge can go a long way.''
   Thomas J. Dodd, a professor of Latin American history at
Georgetown University, said he did not believe that Casolo was
involved with the guerrillas.
   Casolo provided tours of El Salvador as a representative of the
San Antonio, Texas-based Christian Education Seminars, to visiting
church members and others. Professor Dodd was on one of the tours
last month.
   ``She knew what was going on,'' said Dodd. He and others who
knew Casolo's work said she had a wide range of contacts ranging
from high government officials to the poor.
   Lawrence H. Fuchs, a Brandeis University professor who remained
in touch with Casolo after her graduation in 1983, said his former
student was afraid of the government in El Salvador.
   Last year, Casolo wrote to Fuchs that she had a misunderstanding
with police officials and feared recriminations.
   ``I am being watched very carefully,'' she wrote. ``I fear the
lack of application of the law here. A grudge can go a long way
here and lower-level bureaucrats don't like to feel stupid.''
   Casolo's friends and associates say she is being framed to
discredit church workers. Police said her arrest offered proof of
church involvement with the guerrillas, a claim that rightists in
the Salvadoran government have been eager to prove so they can
expel foreign church workers active among the poor.
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who has been on a medical
fact-finding trip in El Salvador since Thanksgiving Day, said in a
statement from Washington, D.C., that he visited Casolo for 45
minutes Monday and informed her that a lawyer was being retained.
   Sen. Dodd and Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said they had been
assured by State Department officials that Casolo was safe and in
contact with U.S. officials.
   The senator, a vociferous critic of U.S. policies in El
Salvador, did not comment directly on the charges but said he was
disturbed the Bush administration seemed already to have confirmed
Casolo's guilt.
   ``These are serious charges,'' he said. ``You're in a war zone
down there. People are doing crazy things.''
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``There are indications of her involvement, that's for certain.''
   `It's fairly clear that these weapons were found there. I mean,
we're not talking about a small package of pistols here. We're
talking about tons of equipment and mortars and dynamite and rounds
of ammunitions and explosives. This is hardly a case of someone
having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way
home,'' Fitzwater said.
   Casolo was in the custody of the National Police, said Jeff
Brown, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in El Salvador. He said she was
being questioned and had not been charged.
   Under the state-of-siege imposed after the rebels launched an
offensive against Salvadoran cities on Nov. 11, authorities have up
to 15 days to file charges or release someone instead of the normal
72 hours.
   Brown said consular officials had been in regular contact with
Casolo and she had not been mistreated.

<HEAD>High Court Limits Injury Benefits for Rail Workers at Docks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal law aimed primarily at compensating
injured dockworkers also applies to railroad employees who clean
and repair dockside loading equipment, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices ruled that three injured railroad
workers from Virginia are limited to receiving benefits under the
Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
   The three had sought potentially greater compensation under a
disability benefits law covering the railroad industry, the Federal
Employers' Liability Act.
   ``Someone who repairs or maintains a piece of loading equipment
is just as vital to, and an integral part of, the loading process
as the operator of the equipment,'' Justice Byron R. White wrote
for the court.
   Because such work is ``essential to the overall loading
process,'' he said, the longshoremen's act is the exclusive remedy
for injuries suffered by people who perform such work.
   Nancy Schwalb and William McGlone, who did clean-up jobs for the
Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., and Robert Goode Jr., a machinist
for Norfolk and Western Railway Co., all worked at coal-loading
terminals in the Hampton Roads, Va., area.
   Ms. Schwalb suffered a serious head injury in 1983 when she fell
from a catwalk while going to a nearby area to pick up spilled coal.
   McGlone's arm was nearly severed as he was picking up coal from
beneath a moving conveyor belt that same year.
   Goode suffered a hand injury while repairing loading equipment
in 1985.
   The three sued their employers under the Federal Employers'
Liability Act. The Virginia Supreme Court allowed the suits after
ruling that their jobs were not covered by the longshoremen's act.
   Today's decision, sparked by the two railroad companies'
appeals, reversed the Virginia Supreme Court ruling.
   The appeals were supported by the Association of American
Railroads. Its lawyers told the justices that 300,000 people
employed by association members could sue, if injured, for
compensation if the Virginia court's ruling were applied nationwide.
   ``The determinative consideration is that the ship-loading
process could not continue unless the (equipment) that Goode worked
on was operating properly,'' White said.
   ``Schwalb and McGlone also were performing duties essential to
the overall loading process,'' he said. ``Equipment cleaning that
is necessary to keep machines operative is a form of maintenance.''
   The cases are C&amp;0 Railway vs. Schwalb, 87-1979, and Norfolk and
Western vs. Goode, 88-127.

   Soviet and American partners today signed a joint
venture deal to build and operate a $2 billion petrochemical
complex in western Siberia.
   The plant in Tobolsk will process petrochemicals that will be
used to make consumer products, largely automotive and medical
items, for both Soviet and foreign markets, according to a news
release put out by the project.
   A consortium of Western firms, led by Combustion Engineering of
Stamford, Conn., entered the deal with the Tobolsk Petrochemical
Company, a subsidiary of the Soviet Ministry of Chemical and Oil
Refining Industries.
   The first phase of the project, construction of the plant, is
expected to be finished by 1993, the release said.
   The plant, which will process Siberian oil and gas, will adhere
to environmental standards as strict as any of those in the West,
it added.
   The announcement came on the same day the Soviet Union and the
Italian automobile giant Fiat signed a joint venture in Rome to
produce 300,000 cars for Soviet consumers.
   The Soviets will hold 70 percent of the $1.3 billion venture,
with the Italians holding the rest. The plant will be located in
Yelabuga, southeast of Moscow.

   A federal jury today grappled with
racketeering charges against three radicals, one day after clearing
them of trying to overthrow the U.S. government.
   The partial verdict acquitting the defendants of seditious
conspiracy Monday came on the 19th day of deliberations in the
yearlong trial. The jury said it had not reached agreement on five
other charges against the 1970s militants.
   Prosecutors alleged the defendants, in their early 40s, were
members of a terrorist group that plotted bombings and bank
robberies on the East Coast from 1976 to 1984 in a conspiracy to
topple the U.S. government.
   Two defendants, Raymond Levasseur and Richard Williams, already
are serving lengthy terms for convictions in connection with some
of the bombings. Patricia Levasseur is free on bail after serving
3{ years of a five-year term for harboring a fugitive, her husband,
Raymond.
   The partial verdict also cleared Mrs. Levasseur of racketeering.
Yet to be decided were charges of racketeering against the two men
and charges of racketeering conspiracy against all three. Each
count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and $20,000 in fines.
   The jury may have had trouble accepting the prosecution's
argument that the little-known defendants were a serious threat to
the government, said Arthur Wolf, professor at Western New England
College of Law.
   ``I think the government was really over-reaching frankly,''
Wolf said.
   An April 1976 bombing at the Suffolk County Courthouse left one
man with his leg severed below the knee, but many of the bombings
failed because of ineptitude.
   ``I can't help believing that when you're talking about
seditious conspiracy that the jurors would take into account in
some respect the inability to carry out the plan,'' Wolf said.
   ``The fact is that conspiracy to overthrow the government by
violence is a ridiculous charge. The government had no right to use
it,'' said Elizabeth Fink, a defense attorney.
   ``These are very broad statutes,'' said Mrs. Levasseur. ``People
get convicted of these charges without ever leaving home.''
   Prosecutors declined comment on the partial verdict.
   The trial began in January after being moved from Boston; jurors
got the case Nov. 6. Nearly 200 witnesses appeared and more than
1,700 exhibits were introduced.
   There were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury
selection in March 1988, part of a band whose members sometimes
called themselves the United Freedom Front. Prosecutors dropped
charges against two defendants, a third pleaded guilty to sedition
and other charges, and a separate trial was ordered for a fourth.
   Prosecutors built their case around notebooks allegedly written
by the defendants that the government charged provided a written
record of meetings and plots.
   But defense attorneys made light of the handwritten notebooks,
with one lawyer saying they might be a ``memoir glorifying
revolutionary action either real or wished for.''
   Levasseur, who represented himself, delivered an intense speech
explaining his political evolution from his service in Vietnam in
the late 1960s, describing himself as ``a soldier that's still at
war.''
   While he did not admit to any of the charges, he did speak about
his desire to cry out against injustices in Central America and
South Africa and said he had never betrayed his values.

   A deaf Rutgers University law student has
won a court order forcing the school to provide her with classroom
notes.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Brotman on Monday ordered Rutgers
University School of Law not to hold two classes attended by Karen
Prince unless she receives notes within 24 hours of each class.
   ``It's all I wanted _ a note-taker,'' said a tearful Ms. Prince.
``I'm very satisfied.''
   Ms. Prince, a third-year student who represented herself, had
sued under federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which requires
recipients of federal funding to ensure that handicapped people
receive equal benefits from programs.
   The school had agreed to provide a note-taker or interpreter in
a 1988 settlement of a lawsuit she filed in 1987. University
attorney Aron Schwartz said the school spent about $10,000 a year
to provide sign language interpreters and note-takers for Ms.
Prince but has had trouble finding qualified candidates. At one
point Ms. Prince rejected notes she said were illegible.
   School officials last week circulated a request asking Ms.
Prince's classmates to provide her with notes. Brotman said no one
complied.
   ``To leave it with the way it's been done _ a hit-or-miss kind
of thing _ we're not getting anywhere,'' said Brotman. ``I've got
to satisfy that she gets that information.
   ``It may cost Rutgers some money, but that's my least concern
now. Rutgers gets plenty of money from the government,'' he said.
   Ms. Prince, 39, who expects to graduate in December, said the
case marks the first time federal civil rights provisions have been
used to force a university to supply assistance for a deaf student.
   ``It would be my hope that they would say, `Wow, there's a deaf
person in law school _ I can do it too,''' said Ms. Prince, who
lost her hearing in 1972.
   She is the only deaf person attending the 700-student law school.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will ask Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to agree to permanent ties for the first time
between the Kremlin and the Holy See, a top Vatican official said
today.
   Gorbachev will arrive in Italy on Wednesday and meet with
Polish-born John Paul on Friday for the first talks between a
leader of the world's Roman Catholics and a Soviet Communist Party
chief.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro, briefing reporters on the
visit, indicated that the issue of Vatican-Moscow ties, broken
after the Russian Revolution in 1917, would be high on the pope's
agenda.
   ``The Holy See is asking for the possibility of a type of
permanent, stable relationship,'' Navarro said.
   The official said it was premature to discuss the matter further
but noted the United States was represented at the Vatican by a
personal envoy of the president even before diplomatic relations
were established in 1983.
   The historic audience on Friday will cap a dramatic warming in
Vatican-Soviet relations, which were marked for decades by mutual
hostility.
   Soviet rulers have viewed religion as a barrier to their
nation's revolutionary goals, while Roman pontiffs have preached
that Communism is evil.
   Navarro praised efforts under Gorbachev to create a new
relationship between the Soviet state and believers.
   But he said problems remain and that the Vatican was waiting for
the Supreme Soviet to take up a new law that would permit various
sects to teach religion as well as practice it. Proselytizing is
now banned.
   The pope's goal for the Catholic Church in the Soviet Union is
the same as for any other country, Navarro said, meaning it wants
to freely nominate bishops, open seminaries and control its own
churches.
   Soviet spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, in Rome preparing for the
visit, said the papal meeting was particularly important because
``it's the first time ever.''
   ``They have talked for years about dialogue between Christians
and Marxists. This time it will be real,'' Gerasimov said.
   ``Christian values are human values and they are the same as
socialist values,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   To update collections in today's high-priced art
market, museums increasingly must put a price on the priceless.
   Curators haven't quite reached the level of ``I'll trade you two
Picassos for a Van Gogh,'' but museum boards are being forced to
sell off some works to buy others. Budgets are simply dwarfed by
the exponential growth in the price of auctioned art works.
   ``In today's art market, museums have a hard time buying,'' said
Lori Starr, spokeswoman for the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, for example, has an
acquisitions budget of about $2 million. In a market where a
Vincent van Gogh painting was recently sold for nearly $54 million,
that doesn't go far.
   Thursday, the museum will put eight American paintings on the
auction block to raise money to buy other American paintings. The
19th and 20th century paintings for sale include works by John
Singer Sargent, Maurice Prendergast, Albert Bierstadt and George
Inness.
   ``In the best of all possible worlds, we could keep every
painting and be able to add through the regular purchase fund,''
said Theodore E. Stebbins, the museum's curator for American
paintings. ``It used to be you could go down and buy wonderful
things on the market (with $2 million.) Now you can't.''
   Stebbins expects each painting to bring at least $3.6 million at
the auction at Sotheby's in New York _ nearly twice the museum's
acquisition budget.
   The Getty museum planned to auction about 15 works today from J.
Paul Getty's private collection, including paintings by Gauguin and
Degas. The expected $13 million to $16 million from the Sotheby's
auction will go toward new purchases.
   The sale of art to buy art is a ``very established, regular
procedure,'' especially as a way of weeding out works of no great
interest to the public, said John Ross, spokesman for the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
   ``If something has not been shown in 30 years, or no other
institute has asked to borrow it .. and if in the considered
opinion of experts in the field, it is not up to the quality of
other works, then it can be removed from the list of works in the
museum and put up for auction,'' he said Monday.
   Ross said guidelines from the American Association of Museums
stipulate that money from auctioned works may not go into daily
expenses or expansion.
   Still, any decision to sell part of a permanent collection is
taken quite seriously, said Getty's Starr. The feelings of the
auction candidate's donor, if there was one, must be considered,
Stebbins said.
   Stebbins said that museums must constantly update their
collections to keep up with trends and new tastes. ``The museum is
a bureau of standards'' for art collectors, he said. ``We have to
have the very best, the highest quality.''
   The Boston museum's American collection was built mostly in the
1940s. ``Now it's 50 years later and there are painters and styles
that are badly missing,'' he said.
   Likewise, a museum may feel it cannot do justice to a particular
period and mmay decide to auction its collection in that area. In
the 1970s, the Metropolitan sold most of an ancient coin collection
because it could not properly display the coins, Ross said.
   The Boston museum garnered some notoriety in 1985 for swapping
two Renoirs and a Monet for ``Troubled Queen'' an abstract
expressionist work by Jackson Pollock. Stebbins defended the swap,
saying the museum was weak in its holdings of moderns, while it
already had many great French Impressionist works.
   A museum also must consider its particular mission when
acquiring or selling art. The Whitney Museum in New York City
auctioned its 19th century works after the board of directors
determined that the museum's goal was to highlight the 20th century.
   ``Our thought on the 19th century is that either we do it well
or we don't do it at all,'' said Susan Larson, permanent collection
curator.
   No one in the art-loving public should be afraid of a favorite
painting going on the block, said Eileen Harakal, spokeswoman for
Chicago's Art Institute. ``We have icons that will always be here;
things that are always untouchable. The overwhelming majority of
our collection is not going anywhere.''

   A wintry storm blew east today after dumping up to 4 feet of
snow in Utah, tearing off roofs in Michigan and Ohio and stranding
200 cars and trucks on a slick highway in Iowa.
   The storm threatened heavy snow from the Great Lakes to northern
New England, the National Weather Service said.
   Police in Minnesota blamed three highway fatalities Monday on
snow from the big low-pressure system. Icy roads were blamed for
three highway deaths in Montana on Sunday.
   The storm system had dropped up to 4 feet of snow in parts of
the Sierra Nevada during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, and,
with a boost from the Great Salt Lake's moisture, it left just as
much at Utah ski areas by Monday.
   ``Hallelujah is the cry from the ski resorts,'' weather service
meteorologist William Alder said. ``The cheers from the ski resorts
can be heard in the valley, but the cries from the morning
commuters in Salt Lake and Davis counties might drown them out.''
   Solitude ski resort got 52 inches of snow, Brighton 47, Alta 46
and Snowbird 44.
   An avalanche warning was in effect on Utah's northern Wasatch
range in some back-country areas and steep slopes, said Bruce
Tremper, director of the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center.
   ``There's good skiing out there (in the back country), but it's
dangerous,'' Tremper said. The search resumed today for a
cross-country skier missing since Saturday in Logan Canyon.
   In South Dakota, Galena, high in the Black Hills, got 18 inches
of snow Monday. Four inches fell at Mount Rushmore, delaying a
structural analysis of the monument's granite faces.
   The moisture was good news for winter wheat farmers.
   ``Nothing better could happen, the truth be known,'' said Ben
Handcock, executive director of the South Dakota Wheat Commission.
   Up to 6 inches of snow combined with gusty winds made for
difficult driving in Minnesota.
   ``The wind is so bad you can't even see anywhere to go,'' said
Clarence Steenblock, operator of the Blue Star Motel in Windom.
   Rain and wet snow mixed with high winds and rapidly falling
temperatures to coat power lines with a thick layer of ice, causing
outages in Marshall in southwestern Minnesota.
   The outage shut off fans that kept a canvas bubble over the
Marshall hockey rink inflated. As the covering sagged, it was
punctured by light poles inside the rink, and wind whipped the
canvas and tore the holes further. Damage was estimated damage at
$20,000 to $30,000.
   Ice combined with up to 2 inches of snow and 40 mph gusts made
driving treacherous in northern Iowa. The Highway Patrol shut down
Interstate 29 between Whiting and Sloan for most of Monday night
after about 200 cars and trucks got stuck.
   Snowfall totaled about 2-4 inches in northern Wisconsin.
   ``The roads are ugly,'' said Jeanne Cox, a dispatcher for the
Oneida County Sheriff's Department.
   Officials were trying to determine today if a tornado touched
down Monday in Butler County, Ohio, during high winds that knocked
out power and uprooted trees in southwest Ohio and northern
Kentucky.
   In Michigan, power company crews were busy early today restoring
power to nearly 30,000 homes on the Lower Peninsula. Winds up to 50
mph, slushy snow, heavy rain and lightning caused the outages and
knocked down at least one house and blew off several home's roofs.
   The weather service said accumulations along the shore of Lake
Superior could reach more than a foot today.
   In Ionia County, strong winds knocked down at least one house
and two garages, and roofs were blown off two houses and a mobile
home, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   Severe winds also tore roofs off and uprooted large trees in
Butler County, Ohio. Most of the power knocked out was restored
today.
   Thunderstorms in Indiana produced half-inch hail south of
Rochester. The most serious storm damage was reported at Fort
Wayne's Baer Field, where winds clocked at 58 mph toppled a parked
airplane and damaged a hangar.

   Carlos Arias Navarro, the last prime
minister appointed under the authoritarian rule of Gen. Francisco
Franco, died of a heart attack and was buried today, his family
said. He was 80.
   A niece, who asked not to be identified, said Arias Navarro died
at 10:20 p.m. Monday at his suburban Madrid home. He had been in
poor health for several years, she said.
   Franco named Arias Navarro, a conservative lawyer and former
mayor of Madrid, as prime minister in December 1973. Arias Navarro
appeared on national television to announce Franco's death on Nov.
20, 1975.
   He was reappointed to the post by King Juan Carlos, who
immediately began dismantling Franco's authoritarian apparatus.
   In July 1976, Arias Navarro resigned and gave way to the
peaceful transition to democracy carried out under the king and
leading to the 1977 general elections, the first since the end of
the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War.
   Arias Navarro, who began his career as a prosecutor, was
appointed mayor of the Spanish capital in 1965 and held the post
until 1973, when he became interior minister.
   He was survived by his wife, Maria Luz. The couple had no
children. He was buried today in a cemetery outside the capital.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today
filled NATO allies in on American plans for military spending
reductions in coming years, officials said.
   Meanwhile, in Budapest, Hungary, the defense ministers of the
seven Warsaw Pact nations began a three-day meeting to discuss
military policies in light of improved East-West relations and the
political upheaval in the East bloc.
   Hungarian Defense Minister Ferenc Kapati said at the opening
session that the ministers would ``put forward and discuss five
important and topical issues that serve the modernization of the
joint armed forces and their defensive doctrine,'' the state MTI
news agency reported. Further details were not immediately provided.
   Defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
eagerly awaited Cheney's briefing at the start of their two-day
meeting.
   Reports of the spending cuts have raised concern about whether
the United States intends to pull out some of its more than 300,000
troops in Europe before an agreement is reached on reducing
conventional arms on the continent.
   Talks are being held in Vienna and an accord is expected next
year.
   But German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said of U.S.
proposals, ``We are talking about plans for the mid-1990s.''
   Officials did not immediately provide details of Cheney's
remarks. He was expected to try to ease any fears about the U.S.
commitment to NATO in the face of the momentous political and
social changes in Eastern Europe.
   Cheney, who stopped in the Netherlands on his way to Belgium,
promised no troops would be pulled out of Europe without an
East-West agreement on conventional arms reductions, the Dutch
government said in The Hague.
   Norwegian Gen. Vigleik Eide, chairman of NATO's panel of top
military commanders, said the Soviet Union and its allies remain
militarily powerful.
   ``The Berlin Wall ... has not much to do with military realities
and does not change the military forces,'' he said. He was
referring to East Germany's decision to let its citizens travel
freely and the opening of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9.
   The NATO defense ministers' talks are the first in a series of
high-level discussions that will be held in the coming weeks at
alliance headquarters.
   Leaders of the 16 member nations will meet Dec. 4 to learn the
results of President Bush's shipboard summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Mediterranean off the island of Malta.

   A low-pressure system churned eastward today with gusts of up to
50 mph, threatening to dump heavy snow from the Great Lakes to
northern New England.
   Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northwest lower Michigan braced
for new snowfall totals of up to a foot, and more than a foot was
also expected along the shore of Lake Superior, the National
Weather Service said.
   A winter weather advisory was in effect today for northern
sections of New Hampshire and for parts of Maine.
   Strong winds were circulating around the storm system in the
Great Lakes, with gusts of up to 50 mph.
   Strong winds also hit parts of southern California on Monday.
   A high wind warning was in effect in southern California today
for the mountains and for areas below Cajon Pass, where gusts of up
to 60 mph were expected, and a wind advisory was in effect for the
rest of the coastal areas of southern California below passes and
canyons.
   Officials were trying to determine today if a tornado touched
down in Butler County, Ohio, during high winds that knocked out
power and uprooted trees in southwest Ohio and northern Kentucky.
   Showers and thunderstorms lashed parts of northern Illinois,
northern Indiana and southern lower Michigan on Monday, as well as
parts of the lower Great Lakes region. Thunderstorms in northern
Indiana produced half-inch hail south of Rochester.
   Temperatures rose into the 60s and 70s Monday as far north as
the middle Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio Valley, and warmed

<HEAD>Delegation Taking Food Aid to Poland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, head of
a U.S. delegation bound for Poland, announced today he will present
a $20 million food-for-peace installment to the Poles during the
visit.
   But Yeutter cautioned against raising unrealistic expectations
for the economies of Poland or other Eastern European countries,
saying economic reform is bound to lag behind political advances.
   ``Economic reform is not an overnight proposition,'' Yeutter
said. ``It will take time. It would be tragic indeed if all the
magnificant emotion of the moment is channeled into frustration.''
   Yeutter spoke with reporters at a White House briefing as the
delegation prepared to leave for its five-day trip to Poland.
   Besides Yeutter, the delegation includes Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and an
assortment of U.S. business and labor leaders.
   Mrs. Dole told the briefing that there will be ``initial pain,''
including increased unemployment, for a workforce ``used to the
communist system _ low wages, little room for advancement and no
encouragement for individual initiative or innovations.''
   She said the administration was prepared to offer Poles
``assistance in easing this pain,'' including consultations on
establishing worker training and retraining programs.
   Mosbacher said he will spend part of his time in Poland pursuing
opportunities for U.S.-Polish business ventures and agreements.
   Yeutter said that, during the visit, he would announce a $20
million installment in U.S. food aid to help Poland get through the
winter. The aid is part of $100 million in food aid announced by
the administration last summer.
   At the same time, Yeutter sounded a pessimistic note on short
term prospects for the economies of Poland and its neighboring East
bloc states.
   ``We just be careful that economic expectations do not become
unrealistic,'' he said. ``In the kind of emotional environment that
exists today, that can very readily occur.''
   ``Each of these countries has experience 40 years or more of
ignominious failure of the communist system. They are now seeking
to convert overnight into a system that is much more nearly
comparable to one we've been honing for 200 years.''
   The delegation was to leave tonight and return back to
Washington on Saturday. Yeutter said a report would be delivered to
President Bush before Christmas.

   A member of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board was killed along with two Venezuelan
pilots when their small plane crashed in hills west of the city,
U.S. Embassy officials said today.
   There were conflicting reports about the number of injured and
their identities.
   Embassy officials said five U.S. diplomats aboard the
twin-engine Cessna 402 were seriously injured in the crash, which
occurred Monday evening, apparently in bad weather.
   In Washington, NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said four passengers
were injured.
   Killed in the crash was Joseph Trippe Nall, 47, who served on
the five-member NTSB since 1986, officials said. The plane's
pilots, Dickson Naranjo and Jose Vargas, also were killed, embassy
officials said.
   The plane apparently was headed to the Charallave municipal
airport, in the hills west of Caracas, when it crashed, Venezuelan
transportation officials said.
   Pollock said Nall was in Caracas to give a speech to the
Venezuelan Aeronautical Congress and that he and his party were on
a Cave Airlines flight around the Caracas area. The plane crashed
as it tried to land in fog.
   Investigators from the Venezuelan transport ministry were on the
scene today. Pollock said the board would send an investigating
team to Caracas later today and that NTSB Chairman Jim Kolstad
would accompany the investigators.
   U.S. Embassy officials said five survivors, a woman and four
men, were being treated in a Caracas hospital and apparently were
in grave condition.
   Nall's assistant, Kenneth Peppard, was among the injured,
Pollock said.
   John Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said in Washington that two FAA employees also were
among the injured. He identified them as David Hanley, who worked
at an FAA hangar at Washington National Airport, and Jerri Alles,
an employee of the agency's international aviation office.
   A fourth passenger was identified as Kay Bond, a producer at
Maryland Public Television for the show ``AM Weather,'' an in-depth
weather program that is distributed nationwide.
   ``It is our understanding that she has not sustained any
injuries, although she is still in the hospital being checked,''
said Sharon Philippart, national promotions manager for Maryland
Public Television. ``It was my understanding that she was on
vacation. She was not traveling for MPT.''
   Nall, a lawyer from Smithfield, N.C., was appointed to the board
April 11, 1986, by President Reagan. His term was due to expire
Dec. 31, 1992.
   He was a native of Atlanta, had a master of divinity degree, and
had preached at Baptist churches in Halifax, Va., and Smithfield.
   Nall also was a pilot and had operated Nall Aviation
Enterprises, a ground school at Johnston County Airport in
Smithfield, the NTSB said.
   Nall's death leaves a vacancy on the five-member board which
must be filled by presidential appointment. By law, the position
must go to a Democrat to keep a political balance on the board,
which now has three Republicans and one Democrat.
   The safety board investigates transportation accidents and
incidents, determines their cause and makes recommendations to
other agencies and organizations to increase safety.

<HEAD>1990 Food Prediction: Supplies Up, Prices Steady</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers will see 1990 food prices rise at a
much slower pace as farmers continue expanding crop production, a
senior Agriculture Department economist predicted Tuesday.
   ``The 1990 food outlook calls for larger supplies and lower
prices,'' said James R. Donald, chairman of the department's World
Agricultural Outlook Board. ``Record meat production, bigger crops
and slowing inflation will hold the retail food prices increase to
3 percent to 5 percent in 1990.''
   Food prices this year are rising nearly 6 percent, the sharpest
annual increase since 1981. Part of the reason for this year's
runup _ prices gained 4.1 percent, on the average, in 1988 _ were
the lingering effects of last year's drought.
   Donald, who presented a paper at the department's annual outlook
conference, said U.S. crop production is likely to increase in 1990
as farmers further expand plantings and yields improve.
   ``World crop production is recovering from last year's reduced
level,'' he said. ``But for most crops, production (in 1989) will
not match continued high levels of use.''
   Next year, Donald said, world commodity consumption will reach a
record level ``in response to larger output, continued economic
expansion and population growth.''
   Prices of farm commodities will be relatively strong because of
demand and lower inventories, although prices of feed grains and
soybeans will ease from the drought-driven levels of 1988 and early
1989.
   ``This outlook suggests U.S. farmers can look forward to another
year of favorable income,'' Donald said. ``Increased marketing
receipts are anticipated because of larger commodity output and
higher prices for some commodities.''
   Lower feed costs will help stabilize farm production expenses in
1990. Thus, even with lower government payments, farmers are
expected to have a net cash income next year of $52 billion to $57
billion, up from a revised forecast of $52 billion to $54 billion
for 1989, he said.
   Previously, USDA had forecast 1989 net cash income at a record
$59.9 billion, up from the previous high of $57.7 billion in 1987.
   Donald said the 1989 forecast was revised downward because
production expenses turned out higher than previously anticipated.
   Net cash income is simply the difference between gross cash
income and cash expenses _ the amount of money farmers have to
spend in a year.
   In another method of accounting, net farm income includes
allowances for changes in inventory values and other adjustments,
including values for family dwelling and other items.
   Under that method, Donald said, 1990 net farm income may be in
the range of $46 billion to $49 billion, down from this year's
record $48 billion to $50 billion.
   Crop yields were ``slightly below trend this year, reflecting
drought damage to the winter wheat crop and less-than-normal
conditions for several other crops,'' he said. ``Subsoil moisture
conditions in the Corn Belt are much improved over a year ago.''
   Donald said that for the combined crops of wheat, feed grains
and soybeans, the projected ``trend'' yield for 1990 is up nearly
2.5 percent from the actual yields of 1989.
   ``Even with reduced soybean production likely, combined grain
and soybean production could be up 5 percent to 7 percent next year
if trend yields are realized and harvested acreage is up 3 percent
to 4 percent,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. and Soviets Will Have Electronic Ears Open At Malta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev
phone home from their Malta summit this weekend, electronic spies
nearby will record the transmissions and save them for years in
hope of one day cracking the codes.
   No matter how friendly their relations, both leaders will bring
their best eavesdroppers, electronic equipment, encoding machines
and countermeasure experts to the Mediterranean rendezvous,
according to knowledgeable officials and observers.
   ``It's a great opportunity for us to see what they can do, and
vice versa,'' said one former government expert, who declined to be
identified by name. ``Any signals they can't identify or decode
they'll turn over to contractors or the National Security Agency to
play with.''
   ``If anybody wants to study antennas, that's the place to go,''
said James Bamford, author of a book on U.S. electronic spying.
   Experts in and out of the government paint this picture of
spying opportunities at the shipboard summit:
   _Each president's communications with experts at home will be
intercepted, but it appears both transmissions are too well
encrypted for the other side to read.
   _The signals will be preserved, perhaps for years, in case a
defector or a technological breakthrough may one day unlock the
codes.
   _It is possible, but unlikely, that the Soviets could eavesdrop
on private strategy sessions between Bush and his aides without
U.S. knowledge. The Soviets have had more opportunity than U.S.
agents to plant the bugs required for such eavesdropping _ if only
because Communist-led shipyard workers have worked on the USS
Belknap in France since it was named as Bush's summit ship.
   _The meeting aboard U.S. and Soviet missile cruisers will be
more secure from such bugging than any site the U.S. side could
have picked except Washington. And both sides might think twice
about planting bugs that could cause big embarrassment if
discovered.
   Bamford said the Navy still sends some less-secure messages
through encoding machines whose designs the Soviets obtained from
the John Walker spy ring. He said U.S. officials believe that, with
those spies in prison, the Soviets can no longer get updated key
cards necessary to decode the signals.
   The president's most secure messages, however, will travel
through separate switchboards, code machines and satellite uplinks
brought to the Belknap by the White House Communications Agency,
according to current and former government officials.
   When the satellite beams messages to Washington, the signal is
so broad that a Soviet listening post in Cuba receives it. But
Bamford and the former government expert said the dishes which
transmit to the satellite also spill their signals sideways a mile
or more, so both Soviet and U.S. technicians can pick up the
other's satellite transmissions as they leave the ships.
   The toughest trick would be to monitor either Bush or Gorbachev
in strategy sessions before and after their face-to-face meetings.
   ``You would have to get a device on board,'' said Harold
Lipsett, a San Francisco detective expert in eavesdropping. He and
other experts said lasers aimed at portholes or induction coils
attached to ship hulls would be detected easily and would not pick
up clear signals.
   ``Maybe you can bug the room,'' Lipsett said, noting that
devices are very small. ``But getting the signal out would be
extremely difficult, because there's heavy metal surrounding all
the rooms on a ship. I would hate the assignment.''
   The Belknap, publicly identified as Bush's summit ship on Oct.
31, was in the DCAN shipyard in Toulon, France, from August until
Nov. 8, getting an overhaul and better communications. The shipyard
employs 5,000 civilians who belong to two unions, one led by
Socialists and the other by Communists.
   Still, the ship will be ``more secure than any land site, where
you have many more opportunities to get in or even to build
microphones into the walls,'' Lipsett said.
   For instance, Vienna, host to summits in 1961 and 1979, has been
a spy's playground. In the early 1950s, U.S. and British spies
tunneled to and tapped Soviet cables. In 1986, Marine embassy guard
Clayton Lonetree confessed to meeting Soviet officials there and in
Moscow. Felix Bloch, under investigation as a Soviet spy, served as
economic counselor and deputy chief of mission from 1980 to 1987.
   The former government expert said Secret Service specialists
will sweep the Belknap non-stop with a spectrum of signals to
activate hidden transmitters. Fine-tuned monitors will be used to
pick up ``piggyback signals'' _ millisecond transmissions a
fraction off the frequency of commercial radio broadcasts, where
they sound like a blip of static, he said.
   But Bamford said repeated Soviet successes in bugging the U.S.
embassy in Moscow show they ``are more advanced in miniaturization
of undetectable bugs.''
   From 1945 to 1952, a Great Seal of the United States contained a
device which monitored the U.S. ambassador there. From 1976 to
1984, transmitters were hidden in embassy typewriters.
   And in 1985, construction of a new embassy was halted. ``There
were hundreds, thousands of real and fake devices in concrete we
let the Soviets deliver to the site,'' one congressional source
said.
   Some experts blame lax U.S. counterintelligence in Moscow for
those Soviet successes. ``But we assume our guys do their best job
whenever the president is involved,'' said another congressional
source.

<HEAD>Cut &amp; Thrust of Question Time Goes on Live TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Question Time, Parliament's most popular event,
went on live television Tuesday, giving viewers a closeup of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher under verbal siege.
   For a fast-moving 15 minutes, Mrs. Thatcher fielded questions on
Eastern Europe, working mothers, her talks with President Bush, the
auto industry, Northern Ireland, homeless youth, the national water
supply and her prospects for extending her 10-year spell in office.
   The cut and thrust was less than savage: no honorable member was
expelled for using unparliamentary language, and Mrs. Thatcher
didn't have to do much shouting.
   It was historic nonetheless, being the first Question Time
starring Mrs. Thatcher since the cameras began rolling in the House
of Commons a week ago, and her first such exchange since declaring
that any talk of her retirement was premature.
   Question Time is a twice-weekly fixture with a code and style
all its own.
   Members hand in their questions ahead of time, then try to catch
the eye of the gowned, bewigged speaker who calls on questioners at
random, trying to balance pro- and anti-government questions.
   The questioners can table a substantive question, but that gives
Mrs. Thatcher time to prepare an answer. Or they can ask her simply
to list her engagements for the day, then follow up with anything
they please.
   The latter tactic is intended to trip the prime minister and
unleash howls of derision from the backbenches.
   Tuesday's session opened with an easy lob from a Conservative on
the government's plans to reform the National Health Service. Mrs.
Thatcher, 64, put on her glasses and read aloud extracts from a
newspaper article by a doctor, ``not of our political persuasion,''
praising the reforms.
   Up bobbed Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party,
grilling Mrs. Thatcher on an official report that the government
sold off an ailing state-owned automaker too cheaply.
   Mrs. Thatcher replied that considering the company had hardly
ever made a profit in recent years, selling it was ``a major
achievement.''
   The Conservatives usually ask the friendly questions, the
opposition lawmakers ask the tough ones. Often, they are merely
statements disguised as questions, which could be summed up as
follows: would Mrs. Thatcher agree that she is terrific, awful,
brilliant, dumb, etc.
   Bob Cryer of Labor belligerently posed his question about water
supplies to ``the aspiring president-for-life-and-prime-minister,''
and predicted Mrs. Thatcher would be ``swept from office and dumped
in the garbage of her own policies.''
   Mrs. Thatcher ignored the barb and answered that her plans to
sell off the national water supply would be a big success.
   Michael Carttiss, a Tory, asked whether Mrs. Thatcher was aware
that he and his constituents believe she should stay on as prime
minister.
   ``I'm very grateful to my honorable friend,'' she replied with a
smile. ``I'm quite sure that his constituents and he are both
right.''

   The Soviet Navy is expected to have four
combat ships capable of using nuclear weaponry in the Mediterranean
during the upcoming Bush-Gorbachev saltwater summit, a Pentagon
spokesman said today.
   ``The Soviet Union is expected to have four nuclear-capable
combatants and four auxiliaries in the Med during the Malta
meeting,'' spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters.
   The statement followed a published report that the Pentagon had
observed a withdrawal of such Soviet vessels, possibly in
anticipation of a Gorbachev initiative to declare the region a
nuclear-free zone.
   Hoffman said the Soviet group will include three guided missile
frigates, the Slava guided missile cruiser _ which will be the site
of talks on Saturday between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev _ and
four other support vessels.
   ``There is no evidence that the Soviets plan to vacate the Med''
during the weekend summit, said one defense official Monday,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday.
   Another official, who also spoke privately, said the Soviets
``still have a submarine presence'' in the Mediterranean, and are
expected to continue to do so through the Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit
off Malta.
   The two leaders are scheduled to share a dinner Saturday night
aboard the U.S. host vessel, the USS Belknap, the guided missile
cruiser that is a command ship for the U.S. Sixth fleet in the
Mediterranean.
   The U.S. Navy will be out in force during the summit,
represented in the Mediterranean by some 25 combat ships _
including the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal and the dozen
destroyers, cruisers and frigates that compose its battle group.
   Also in the area is an amphibious ready group composed of five
ships ready to deploy some 2,400 Marines, said Navy spokesman Cmdr.
Craig Quigley.
   While the defense official confirmed there is ``a slight
depression'' in the number of Soviet combat ships present in the
area compared to about a year ago, he argued that such a cut could
be due as much to economical as political considerations.
   About a year ago, the Pentagon counted about six to 10 Soviet
combatants in the region, with a range of 12 to 24 support ships.
During the summit, the number is expected to range from about four
to six major combat ships, with ``a few more'' support vessels, the
official said.
   All of the Soviet combat ships are capable of using nuclear
weapons, the official said.
   ``Our intelligence tells us that this dip appears to be part of
a normal rotation. Whether it is a permanent retrenchment, or a
temporary aberration, we just don't know,'' the official said.
   The official noted that during the past months, the United
States has received evidence of a worldwide downturn in Sovet naval
activity, a step that was widely interpreted as being taken due to
pressures on the Soviet economy.

   A colder-than-normal winter is expected in the

Service said today.
   The odds of below-normal temperatures in the months of December
through February extend down the California coast and also include
Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and the
Dakotas, the agency said in releasing its long-range forecast.
   A warmer-than-normal winter is expected in New England and along
the East and Gulf coasts as far west as Texas. Kentucky, Tennessee
and Arizona also will see warmer weather, the forecast said.
   States between those areas can expect equal chances of either
warm or cold weather.
   A wetter-than-normal winter is expected in states bordering the
Mississippi River and east to the Appalachians.
   Drier-than-normal conditions were predicted for south Florida,
the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and adjacent New Mexico and
Colorado.
   Other areas are listed as having equal chances of wet or dry
weather.

   More than 300 Vietnamese refugees who had
waited two years in this British colony boarded a plane Tuesday for
their journey to the West in the largest one-day resettlement of
refugees from Hong Kong in seven years.
   Most of the Vietnamese will go the the United States after six
months in the Philippines to study English and learn about life in
the United States.
   Others were sent to Sweden and Australia. Government statistics
showed that was the largest one-day resettlement of Vietnamese
refugees in seven years.
   Another 12,700 Vietnamese refugees still are waiting in Hong
Kong to be resettled in the West.
   More than 5,000 will be resettled in mid-1990, said Alfred
Kottek, the regional representative of the Intergovernmental
Committee for Migration who organized the refugees' transportion.
   The refugees in Hong Kong either arrived before June 1988 or
were classified as refugees under a screening policy.
   In June 1988, the government adopted a policy that treats all
Vietnamese boat people as illegal immigrants unless they prove they
are fleeing persecution. Those classed as illegal immigrants face
repatriation to their Communist homeland.
   Nearly 44,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong are waiting to
be screened. So far this year, 33,889 have arrived, compared with
18,052 in the same period of 1988. Most won't be classified as
refugees.
   Francis Maude of the British Foreign Office said forcible
repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong will begin by
February or March.
   On Thursday, 132 Vietnamese boat people, including 12 babies
born in Hong Kong, will fly back to their homeland voluntarily, the
sixth such group.
   Since March, 507 Vietnamese have volunteered to go back under a
plan monitored by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, whose office pays each one $50 before departure.

   The U.S. government is entitled to some of the
money American companies are awarded by an international tribunal
created as part of the settlement of the 1981 Iran hostage crisis,
a unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   The justices said the companies' rights are not violated by
requiring them _ rather than all U.S. taxpayers _ to help defray
the costs of the claims settlement process.
   The court upheld a 1985 law that allows the U.S. government to
deduct 1.5 percent of the first $5 million recovered by any company
and 1 percent of anything exceeding that amount.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said the
deductions are reasonable even if they do not equal the amount of
money the government expended to help the companies win their
claims.
   ``This court has never held that the amount of a user fee must
be precisely calibrated to the use that a party makes of government
services,'' he said. ``Nor does the government need to record
invoices and billable hours to justify the costs of its services.''
   White rejected arguments by Sperry Corp. that forcing companies
to pay the fees is an unconstitutional confiscation of their
property and that any costs to the government should be borne by
the nation as a whole.
   ``As we see it, Sperry has not identified any of its property
that was taken without just compensation,'' he said.
   The Bush administration said tens of millions of dollars were at
stake, including some $12.7 million already deducted by the U.S.
government from claims paid to companies.
   The financial deal that freed the 52 American hostages from Iran
in 1981 included the U.S. government's release of billions of
dollars in frozen Iranian assets and creation of an international
tribunal to resolve claims against Iran.
   The Supreme Court in 1981 upheld the power of former President
Carter to approve the settlement, and that was not at issue in
Tuesday's ruling.
   Sperry Corp., which leased computer systems to Iran before the
1979 hostage crisis severed relations between the United States and
that country, was awarded $2.8 million by the international claims
tribunal.
   The U.S. government deducted $42,000 for its expenses in helping
Sperry.
   Tuesday's decision overturned a federal appeals court ruling
last year that the deduction was an unconstitutional seizure of
private property.
   The high court ruling is not related directly to recent
developments suggesting eased tensions between Iran and the United
States.
   The Bush administration announced three weeks ago that the
United States is returning $567 million in frozen assets to Iran, a
move President Bush said he hopes will prompt Tehran to push for
freedom for American hostages in Lebanon.
   The $567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by
American banks against Iran.
   In another case, the high court ruled, 9-0, that a federal law
aimed primarily at compensating injured dockworkers also applies to
railroad employees who clean and repair dockside loading equipment.
   It ruled that three injured railroad workers from Virginia are
limited to receiving benefits under the Longshoremen's and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act. They had sought potentially greater
compensation under a disability law covering the railroad industry,
the Federal Employers' Liability Act.

   The space shuttle Columbia was
transported to a refurbished launch pad Tuesday for a Christmastime
mission to deploy one satellite and retrieve another the size of a
bus before it falls to Earth.
   The shuttle's five astronauts rode along for part of the way on
the giant tracked vehicle that moved Columbia to pad 39A on a
six-hour, 4.2-mile trip from an assembly building.
   The last shuttle launched from pad 39A was Columbia in January
1986.
   All eight shuttle flights since then have lifted off neighboring
pad 39B while workers gave 39A a $50 million facelift. They added
safety features and improved electrical, fuel line, environmental
control and other systems.
   NASA now has two pads as it moves into a busy schedule that
calls for nine shuttle flights in 1990.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein, who will command Columbia, commended
the workers who did the pad overhaul.
   ``About a month ago just about everyone around here would not
have guessed that pad A would be ready,'' he told reporters. ``But
because of a great effort by all the folks, as you can see, it's
ready to go.
   ``We're looking forward to going on Dec. 18 and spending
Christmas in orbit for 10 days and getting a lot of things
accomplished and getting LDEF back.''
   LDEF is the Long Duration Exposure Facility, an 11-ton,
30-foot-long satellite that is expected to reenter the atmosphere
and break up in February if it is not recovered.
   NASA has said there is only a remote possibility of anyone
getting hurt by falling debris.
   But the space agency and the Defense Department want the
spacecraft back to find out what has happened to the materials and
experiments on board during their lengthy exposure to
weightlessness, radiation, vacuum and micrometeorites. The results
would help in designing NASA's permanent space station and the Star
Wars missile shield.
   LDEF was put in orbit in 1984 by another shuttle crew and was to
have been retrieved 10 months later, but launch delays and the
Challenger disaster in 1986 postponed the effort for years.
   Before tracking down LDEF on the fourth day of the mission, the
astronauts are to release a Navy communications satellite named
Syncom.
   Columbia's other crew members are pilot Jim Wetherbee and
mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low.

<HEAD>Gov't Suggests Closing Leaning Tower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top government commission for public
works suggested Tuesday the famed leaning tower of Pisa be closed
for restoration work.
   The recommendation by the Superior Council of Public Works was
passed along to Parliament, which must make the final decision.
   Experts recently have voiced alarm about decay in the 162-foot
tower, completed between 1360 and 1370. Local officials counter
that the monument, which attracts thousands of tourists every
month, is not in any immediate danger.
   The commission did not say it could collapse. It said the
closure would allow conservation work to begin.
   Its tilt has been increasing by an average 0.047 inches a year
since measurements began in 1918. It has remained open to tourists,
even through World War II.
   Gero Geri, a professor of topography, has said it will take more
than 100 years before the tower reaches the point where it will
likely fall.
   The government allotted funds for the conservation and
strengthening of the tower but experts have been stumped on how to
save the building, which a popular Italian song says ``leans,
leans, but never comes down.''

   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday
approving a boundary compact between South Dakota and Nebraska
involving a 12-mile stretch of the Missouri River.
   The compact sets the boundary at the midpoint of the main river
channel between Union County, S.D., and Dakota County, Neb.
   The two states originally agreed to set the border at the
midpoint of the Missouri River channel in 1905, but since then the
river has shifted due to both natural causes and Corps of Engineers
navigation and flood control projects.
   The new compact establishes the current midpoint of the river as
the boundary. It provides for future adjustments should the river
shift again.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer today denied clemency for a
retarded man scheduled to go to the electric chair Thursday for
murdering a state trooper at 17.
   Roemer rejected the recommendation of the Louisiana Pardon
Board, which voted 3-2 Monday that he commute Dalton Prejean's
sentence to life in prison.
   The governor's announcement came minutes after the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans turned down an appeal from
Prejean, now 30.
   Louisiana's longest-serving death row inmate is scheduled to die
shortly after midnight on Thursday for the 1977 slaying of Trooper
Donald Cleveland. Prejean has been on death row for nearly 12 years.
   The U.S. Supreme helped clear the way for his execution in July
when it ruled in separate cases that the Constitution's ban on
cruel and unusual punishment does not bar the execution of
murderers who are retarded or were juveniles when they killed.
   In Virginia and Alabama, two killers described respectively as
borderline retarded and mildly retarded were put to death in August
and July after the ruling.
   Yvonne Foreman, chairman of the pardon board, said the majority
voted for clemency based on testimony that Prejean had been abused
as a child, that he probably suffered some brain damage as a child
and that he had a good prison record and showed remorse.
   The appeals argued that Prejean, who is black, had an all-white
jury and an ineffective court-appointed lawyer. The jury was never
told that he was abused as a child, that he is mildly retarded or
that he was drinking heavily the night of the murder.
   Six months before the killing, Prejean was released from a
reform school to which he had been sent for killing a taxi driver
at age 14.
   Prejean has expressed his regrets to the family of the trooper
he shot twice in the face with a .38-caliber pistol after a traffic
stop.
   ``I ask them not to hate me for all of their life,'' said
Prejean, who was shackled during his testimony before the board at
the state prison. ``That same hate can destroy them.''
   Prejean blamed most of his problems on an unhappy childhood. ``I
was always charged with being wrong even when I tried to do right.''
   David Baer, a psychiatrist at the University of Massachusetts
School of Medicine, said he examined Prejean in 1984 and believes
that while Prejean knows right from wrong, apparent brain damage
makes it difficult for him to deliberate when in a violent mood.
   If allowed to live, Prejean could be the subject of tests that
might help others with similar brain problems to avoid violence,
Baer said.
   ``His death would teach us absolutely nothing,'' he said.
   David Smith, father of the trooper's widow and spoksman for the
family, said Cleveland's relatives wanted justice, not revenge.
   ``If we're going to have a death penalty, let's use it. If we
don't want it, let's do away with it. But let's don't drag these
things out 12 years.''

   A thief apparently drove away in a
stolen car without noticing a quadriplegic 10-year-old boy on the
back seat, but the boy was found unharmed in the parked car nearly
three hours later.
   Curtis Michael Walker and his father's rented 1990 Lincoln Town
Car were recovered Monday in the neighboring Detroit suburb of
Birmingham, police said.
   ``I imagine it was merely a crime of opportunity where someone
saw that brand new Town Car and wanted to steal it,'' Royal Oak
police Lt. Don Novak said. ``I assume they did not realize the
child was in the back seat.
   ``It turned out to be a happy ending.''
   The Rev. Curtis Walker of Riverview had placed his son in the
back seat and left the car running outside a rehabilitation clinic
for a few minutes while he went inside to help his wife, Peggy, to
the car, Novak said.
   There were no suspects in the case, Novak said.

   Flashes of light reflected off a
mirror and ``Help'' spelled out in the snow led to the rescue of
five young people stranded for two cold nights in the Blue
Mountains.
   Kem Jones, a Walla Walla firefighter and pilot, said he and two
paramedics were searching for the youths by airplane when they
noticed the flash of sunlight reflected off a mirror held by one of
the youths.
   The youths, ages 7 to 20, waved frantically and scrawled
``Help'' in the snow after spotting the plane Monday, Jones said.
   The five had left Walla Walla on Saturday after telling their
parents they were going to play in the snow at Tollgate, Ore., said
Umatilla County, Ore., Sheriff Jim Carey. But the youths said their
four-wheel-drive vehicle got stuck in snow in the Blue Mountains,
which straddle the Washington-Oregon border.
   Jones said he was flying over an area outside the official
search boundary ``on a hunch. I know where I would go, which I did
when I was a kid.''
   ``They were elated. I think they thought they might not make it.
They were cold and wet and had tennis shoes on,'' he said. ``They
had serious thoughts of not making it. They were real elated to see
the plane.''
   The helicopter plucked the five from the Table Rock area about
30 miles east of Walla Walla in Columbia County, said Capt. Joyce
Gerdes of the Umatilla County sheriff's department.
   The five were flown to Walla Walla and released to relatives,
Gerdes said.
   Umatilla County Deputy Keith Garoutte said searchers had to
contend with freezing temperatures and fog, and with snow depths
ranging from a few inches to a foot.

   Former White House chief of staff
Donald T. Regan paid $400,000 for a two-acre lot in Williamsburg's
exclusive Kingsmill community and plans to build a home there, a
spokeswoman says.
   Court records show Regan and his wife, Ann B. Regan, paid cash
for the wooded land in a sale that was closed Nov. 17.
   The Regans have arranged to have a house built on the lot by
June, said Kathleen Reid, executive assistant to Regan. They are
selling their home in Alexandria but will keep a house in Sarasota,
Fla., she said.
   Regan served former President Reagan as Treasury secretary for
four years before taking over as chief of staff for two years. He
resigned in February 1987 following a bitter dispute with Nancy
Reagan.

   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrons of the Metropolitan Opera got a little
more drama than they had anticipated when mezzo-soprano Helga
Dernesch fainted on stage.
   Ms. Dernesch, who was playing the vocally demanding role of
Nurse in Richard Strauss' ``Die Frau ohne Schatten,'' ``paused,
coughed and fell to the floor'' about 50 minutes into the 60-minute
first act of the three-act opera Monday, said Metropolitan
spokesman Charles Sheek.
   ``Then the curtain was brought down and we decided to take an
intermission,'' he said.
   Ms. Dernesch was attended by the house doctor, who concluded
that ``she may be a little anemic, but she's fine and she's going
home,'' said Sheek.
   The opera resumed with another singer, Diane Curry, singing the
part, Sheek said.

   A principal decided to cancel an anti-drug
talk by rap artist Flavor Flav at a high school after seeing
another member of the group Public Enemy on television.
   Flav was to appear as part of an anti-drug program Monday at
North Central High School.
   The program was canceled after Principal Charles Roach watched
Friday's edition of the ABC News program ``Nightline,'' in which a
discussion of racism in music included a clip of Public Enemy
member Professor Griff calling Jews wicked. The rap artist later
apologized.
   ``Based on the controversy associated with Public Enemy, the
convocation in my opinion was not going to be a positive
experience,'' Roach said Monday.
   The Rev. Charles Williams, president of Indiana Black Expo,
which sponsored the anti-drug program, said he was disappointed and
that Roach's decision bordered on racism.

   A Vermont foundation to help black
students attend Catholic universities has been named after Sister
Thea Bowman, the only black member of the Franciscan Sisters of
Perpetual Adoration.
   ``I was skeptical at first,'' said Bowman, 51, of Canton. ``Poor
people have had so many things promised. I don't mean a handout, I
mean an opportunity, a chance. You don't raise people's hopes
without the real possibility of doing something that's going to be
successful.''
   Bowman pioneered the use of both African-American spirituals and
African rituals and dance in Mass. She directs the Inter-Cultural
Awareness office for the Jackson Diocese and released an album of
spirituals last year.
   The idea for the foundation came from the Rev. Thomas Hoar,
director of Campus Ministry at St. Michael's College in Colchester,
Vt., and Leonard and Mary Lou Jennings of Stowe, Vt., benefactors
of many St. Michael's students.

   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday
renaming the Maryland and District of Columbia portion of the
George Washington Memorial Parkway as the Clara Barton Parkway.
   Clara Barton was the 19th century nurse and founder of the
American Red Cross who was called the ``Angel of the Battlefield''
for her efforts during the Civil War.
   She lived at Glen Echo, Md., midpoint of the seven-mile stretch
of parkway now named in her honor.
   Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., instigated the name change both to
honor Barton and to help motorists who confused the
Maryland-District stretch of the parkway with the longer, better
known portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway on the
Virginia side of the Potomac River.
   The 27-mile Virginia portion runs from McLean, Va., on the
western end down to Washington's homestead in Mount Vernon, Va.,
with a break in Alexandria, Va.
   Bush also signed separate legislation approving the location of
a memorial within the 2.2-acre Vietnam Veterans Memorial site on

   The streets of Prague were quiet
Tuesday for the first time since a crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators 11 days ago drove the people to demand reform.
   The main opposition group Civic Forum called for a temporarily
end to the mass demonstrations that set the city center in motion.
Small groups nevertheless continued to gather in Wenceslas Square
to discuss the changes.
   ``We have courage again,'' a student said. ``I don't think
anyone can shut us up again.''
   Czechs and Slovaks, who once before lived through democratic
reforms of 1968, long were reluctant to challenge the hard-line
leadership put in place after Soviet-led troops crushed the
``Prague Spring.''
   But that changed after Nov. 17, when hundreds were beaten in an
unmatched display of brutality, as police broke up a crowd of
50,000 who dared call for reforms.
   The student was one of hundreds who gathered on Wenceslas
Square, the heart of the pro-democracy movement, to discuss the
changes that brought down the leadership of Milos Jakes and forced
Premier Ladislav Adamec to talk to the opposition.
   After a meeting with the opposition Tuesday, Adamec pledged to
form a coalition government by Dec. 3, and Prague residents clearly
were elated by the thought of non-Communists sharing power for the
first time in decades.
   ``After years of silence, we can talk freely again,'' said an
old woman, who, like the others at the square spoke rapidly,
without taking the time to give her name. ``Democracy has already
won.''
   The crowd repeatedly sang the national anthem and waved their
hands in ``V'' for victory signs, doffing their hats despite the
freezing temperatures.
   The statue of King Wenceslas _ a towering figure on horseback _
was draped with flags and banners. Candles flickered along its base.
   Lines formed outside shops along the square to read the daily
pro-democracy bulletins taped in the windows, and people eagerly
read new leaflets printed during the night.
   One young warehouse worker, referring to Adamec's promise of a
new government, said it would be ``transitional,'' but was
nevertheless positive.
   ``More important is the promise that the Communist Party will
give up its leading role,'' he said, alluding to agreement to
remove such language from a new constitution.
   Many older people joined the students on the square. It was
largely the students, backed by artists and intellectuals, who have
carried the democracy movement.
   A box for donations to the students' movement was quickly
filled. Nearly everyone who stopped on the square to join the
discussions or passed by threw in money. Even pensioners dropped in
a few coins.
   ``It's as though the people of Prague have suddenly awakened,''
said a woman listening nearby. ``Only a few weeks ago they were
only interested in their car, their weekend house and food. Now
politics is at the forefront, like in 1968.''
   People have been reluctant to get involved in politics, after
their experiences 21 years ago. The country has one of the highest
living standards in the Soviet bloc and consumer goods are more
plentiful than elsewhere.
   ``We've fought ourselves free!'' a worker on the square
exclaimed.

<TEXT>
   Alcoholism centers from New England to
Arizona are opening their doors this week to 110 Soviets eager to
see how the disease is treated in this country.
   The Soviets were to spend Monday and Tuesday in Stamford before
splitting into groups to tour treatment centers in 11 states over
two weeks.
   American and Soviet views of alcoholism differ. In the United
States, where an estimated 18 million adults have a drinking
problem, the disease is seen as societal and affecting the
drinker's family. Treatment focuses on why one drinks.
   The Soviets have placed more attention on physical approaches,
such as acupuncture and liver dialysis. Only 5 million Soviets are
recognized officially as alcoholics needing treatment, but
conference delegates estimate an additional 15 million or more are
problem drinkers.
   ``I hope that while they're here they will learn a great deal
how the family gets enmeshed in the disease and needs its own
recovery,'' said Anne Geller, a director of a New York treatment
center who helped organize the conference.
   ``They also, I hope, will learn the importance of destigmatizing
alcoholism and treating it as any other disorder,'' she said. ``No
one in the Soviet Union would get up and say, `I'm a recovering
alcoholic,' whereas people here do it all the time.''
   Betty Ford, the former first lady who has reinforced that
approach by proclaiming she is a recovering alcoholic, greeted some
of the delegates Sunday night. The Betty Ford Treatment Center in
Rancho Mirage, Calif., is among the conference hosts.
   This is the second meeting for the experts, who first exchanged
information at an April conference in Moscow attended by about 100
Americans.
   The conference was the brainchild of Father Luis Dolan, a Roman
Catholic priest who coordinates Soviet exchanges for the Wainwright
House in Rye, N.Y. Dolan, who has visited the Soviet Union several
times, said some of the questions he heard most often on his early
trips had to do with alcoholism.
   ``Something just touched me here,'' he said, striking his chest
with a fist, ``when they said, `Can we organize a conference?'''
   The Soviet delegates include scientists, recovering alcoholics
and treatment specialists as well as ballet dancers who belong to
an anti-drug and alcohol group.
   Delegation leader Levon Badalyan, president of the European
Association of Neurologists, said he admires the American concept
of using the schools to teach young children about drug and alcohol
abuse. He also approves of President Bush's attacks on drugs and
the use of actors, athletes and other prominent citizens to
discourage drug abuse.
   He was not impressed by a Soviet effort to crack down on
excessive drinking by raising prices, restricting where liquor is
sold and raising the drinking age for liquor to 21.
   ``The point is that such restrictive measures breed bootlegging,
production of homemade alcohol, and worse cases of alcoholism
appear,'' he said.
   ``The way to overcome alcoholism, in my view, is through raising
the general cultural level of society, raising it spiritually, ...
providing a person with specific goals in his life, and finally,
impressing on the person that alcoholism is a bad habit,'' he said.
   The conference will take Badalyan and other delegates to halfway
houses, outpatient clinics and other treatment centers, which are
much smaller than those in the Soviet Union, where the largest
alcoholism facility has 6,000 beds.

   A man whose fatally wounded victim
used deathbed eye blinks to identify him as the assailant was
sentenced Tuesday to six months in jail.
   ``God brought him back for a few moments to communicate with
detectives,'' Westchester County Court Judge John LaCava said of
Frederick Sannicandro, 38.
   Sannicandro died six hours after he was shot in the abdomen by
his friend, Frank Zollbrecht, 45, as they were working in a Yonkers
bakery last year.
   While he was being wheeled into surgery, detectives and an
attending physician questioned Sannicandro and asked him to respond
with one blink for ``yes'' and two blinks for ``no.''
   Sannicandro blinked ``yes'' when asked if Zollbrecht had shot
him and ``no'' when asked if the shooting was accidental, according
to trial testimony.
   He could not speak because he had a breathing tube in his throat.
   Zollbrecht had a history of alcohol abuse, according to
testimony. During drunken horseplay, he got a gun his boss had
hidden and shot Sannicandro.
   The defense maintained that Sannicandro's deathbed testimony
should not have been allowed because Sannicandro also was drunk.
   Zollbrecht, convicted of criminally negligent homicide, could
have been sentenced to four years in prison. Assistant District
Attorney Michael Romano argued for a one-year term, saying the
defendant had ignored warnings about drinking and the gun.
   Zollbrecht's lawyer, Anthony Morosco, said his client had been
traumatized at age 7 by the death of an older brother. ``He's a
good person who has suffered a series of great tragedies in his
life,'' Morosco said.
   A tearful Zollbrecht told the judge, ``I would never hurt
Freddy. I'm sorry for what happened. What can I say? I'm sorry I
touched the gun. I'm sorry.''
   LaCava ordered that Zollbrecht spend five years on probation
after his prison term, do 1,000 hours of community service and get
treatment for his drinking and any psychological problems.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pledged
Tuesday the United States won't withdraw troops from Europe without
consulting the allies, officials said at the first NATO meeting
since the Berlin Wall was opened.
   ``The United States will continue to have its forces in Europe
as long as our NATO allies want them (and) need them there,'' said
a senior U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We are in Europe to stay,'' the official quoted Cheney as
telling other defense ministers at the start of two days of talks
at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Reports about U.S. plans to reduce its military spending in the
coming years have prompted concern that the United States intended
to pare its commitment to the defense of the European continent.
More than 300,000 U.S. troops are based in Europe, most in West
Germany.
   But Cheney used the meeting to explain to his colleagues the
U.S. budget process and calm any fears about U.S. intentions in the
future.
   Britain's secretary of state for defense, Tom King, said Cheney
``gave clear assurances of an absolute commitment to consultation
... that the United States is here, ready to play its full part in
NATO (and) in Europe.''
   German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said, ``We are
talking about plans for the mid-1990s.''
   ``I take the position that the United States will not change its
stance in the current (conventional arms) negotiations,'' he said.
   The 16 nations of NATO and the seven of the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact are holding negotiations in Vienna, Austria, to reduce sharply
conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe.
   President Bush proposed in May that as part of those talks, the
Soviet Union and the United States cut their forces in Europe to
275,000 soldiers each. That would require a cutback of 300,000 in
Soviet forces and 30,000 in U.S. troops.
   Those negotiations are expected to end with an agreement in the
last half of 1990.
   Cheney told the ministers that speculation about U.S. troop
cutbacks stemmed from the Defense Department's look at its budgets
in the 1992-1995 period, according to the U.S. official. No final
budget decisions have been made.
   He promised the allies, the official said, that the United
States ``will not make any unilateral reductions (in troops) and
that any reductions would be considered in the NATO context and in
full consultation with our allies.''
   No figure was given for possible troop cuts in the future, he
said.
   He noted Congress has in recent years sliced the Pentagon's
budget requests and that trend was likely to continue.
   Moreover, the budget plans were being drawn up, he said, based
on assumptions of a conventional arms agreement, a superpower
accord on long-range nuclear missiles, no major military conflicts
in the Third World and continued political reforms in Eastern
Europe.
   The worst case projection, he said, was likely for $180 billion
in reductions over four years. Still, he said the United States
intended to spend $300 billion a year on defense in the mid-1990s.
   The official said no troops would be pulled out of Europe in the
1990 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, except for those reduced
because of the 1987 superpower treaty on intermediate-range nuclear
forces.
   The 1991 defense budget, which will be sent to Congress in
January, was not expected to trim U.S. forces in Europe, he said.
   With the dramatic events unfolding in Eastern Europe, NATO
officials have been concerned that Western nations will lower their
defense spending even before an arms deal is struck.
   Norwegian Gen. Vigleik Eide, head of NATO's panel of military
commanders, said the Soviet Union and its Eastern allies remain a
powerful military might.
   He acknowledged the startling reforms in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe have lowered public perceptions of the military
threat from the East.
   ``Support for defense efforts in the future will be problematic
because of the perception of the threat as already gone,'' he said.
   But he insisted the West's policy should be guided by force
levels.
   ``The Berlin Wall ... has not much to do with military realities
and does not change the military forces,'' he said.
   Leaders of the NATO nations will meet Monday to learn the
results of Bush's shipboard summit Dec. 2-3 with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   NATO defense ministers meet twice a year in their role as the
Defense Planning Committee. France, which is outside NATO's
military structure, does not attend. Iceland, which has no armed
forces, has observer status.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Defense Budget Could be Cut $145 Billion, Without Compromises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States could cut its defense
spending by $145 billion over 10 years and still maintain its
military capability by delaying production of the next generation
of strategic weapons, two defense analysts said Tuesday.
   Procurement of such high-priced items as the B-2 stealth bomber
and the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the costs of which have pushed
the current Pentagon budget to $305 billion, could remain in the
testing stage until fast-moving developments in Eastern Europe come
into focus.
   ``Since we've just gone through a wartime buildup without a war,
there's no reason to rush into strategic modernization,'' said
Lawrence J. Korb, a former Reagan administration defense official
who addressed a news conference at the Brookings Institution. ``We
should postpone until we see what happens in the world.''
   On the heels of stunning democratic reforms in the Eastern bloc
nations and the demise of the Berlin Wall, the call for a reduction
in the U.S. defense budget has grown louder.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has been pondering sweeping
changes, including cuts of several thousand in U.S. armed forces,
elimination of 100 Navy ships and closing of at least a dozen Air
Force bases, according to Pentagon officials who requested
anonymity.
   The Pentagon is expected to submit its fiscal 1991 budget plan,
with a possible cut of $20 billion from a $317 billion spending
level, to the Office of Management and Budget by Dec. 8, the
officials said.
   Another speaker at the news conference, William W. Kaufmann, a
Harvard University lecturer and Pentagon veteran, said the cuts
would reduce the current defense budget of $305 billion to $160
billion by 1999. The cumulative reduction would add up to $500
billion in savings.
   Among Kaufmann's proposals in the first five years are
cancellation of one land-based nuclear weapon _ the
multiple-warhead, rail-based MX missile, and scaling back of the
Air Force's $70 billion plan for 132 B-2 bombers to 13.
   Spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative would average about
$3 billion a year. Congress recently slashed $1.1 billion from
President Bush's request of $4.9 billion for the proposed
anti-missile shield in the budget that took effect Oct. 1.
   One active-duty Army division would be cut, as would two of the
14 aircraft carrier battle groups, according to Kaufmann's plan,
which will be included in a book to be published next month by the
liberal-leaning Brookings Institution.
   Kaufmann, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, served as a consultant to former Secretaries of Defense
Robert S. McNamara of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and
Harold Brown of the Carter administration.

   A girl who received part of her mother's liver in
the nation's first such living-donor transplant underwent nearly
five more hours of surgery today to stop internal bleeding,
hospital officials said.
   Despite the bleeding, doctors predicted success for Monday's
transplant operations on 21-month-old Alyssa Smith and her mother,
Teresa. Specialists say the procedure could relieve a severe
shortage of organs for children, many of whom die while awaiting a
liver from a cadaver.
   During the night Alyssa's new liver began to bleed, a
complication that occurs in about 30 percent of all liver
transplants, said John Easton, a spokesman for University of
Chicago Medical Center.
   The youngster was returned to the operating room before dawn.
Surgeons needed only a few minutes to stop the bleeding but kept
Alyssa in surgery to make sure there were no more complications,
said Dr. Christoph Broelsch.
   ``She's doing quite well and is stable. For now, things are back
on a smooth course,'' said Broelsch, who led the surgical team in
the first liver transplant from a living donor in this country.
   Both mother and daughter had been in critical condition after
Monday's 14-hour dual operations. Mrs. Smith's condition was
upgraded to fair; Alyssa was listed in critical but stable
condition after this morning's surgery.
   Monday's procedure was complicated when Mrs. Smith's spleen was
damaged and had to be removed, but doctors predicted she would
recover fully.
   Broelsch, who pioneered the technique for using segments of
donor livers in 1984 while at the University of Hanover in Germany,
said doctors will know in a week whether Alyssa's body is rejecting
the liver.
   But he said, ``We're quite confident that this organ will work.''
   Previously, the only regularly performed living-donor
transplants have involved kidneys and pancreas segments.
   Liver transplants from living donors have been performed three
times _ in Brazil, Australia and Japan. All three operations were
carried out in emergency situations, and one child died.
   Monday's operation was the first of 20 live-donor liver
transplants authorized by the Chicago hospital to determine if the
procedure is viable. The operations will be done on patients who
have no alternative, said Dr. Peter Whitington, director of
pediatric transplant services.
   ``We don't think this will be the treatment of choice for every
patient,'' said Broelsch, noting the hospital had been
transplanting portions of livers from cadavers into children since
1984 with better than 80 percent success.
   In the United States, half the estimated 700 babies who need
liver transplants each year die for lack of a donor.
   ``If this procedure works as well as we hope it will, it will be
a significant breakthrough,'' said Dr. Walter Andrews, director of
the pediatric transplant program at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
   Within hours of Monday's operation, the Children's Liver
Foundation in Sherman Oaks, Calif., was swamped with calls from
parents about the procedure.
   Alyssa suffers from an often-fatal liver disorder called biliary
atresia, the leading cause for liver transplants involving
children. She had been waiting more than a year for a transplant.
   Surgeons removed the left lobe of Mrs. Smith's liver, or about
one-third of the organ. The most tense moments came when Mrs.
Smith's spleen was accidentally damaged, Broelsch said.
   ``We didn't expect that at all, but we had it under control in
two or three minutes,'' he said. ``In no way at any point was the
mother's life in danger.''
   People can live without the spleen, an organ that modifies the
structure of blood, but this may make them more susceptible to
infection, hospital spokesman Ed Ernst said.
   John L. Smith said he hoped his daughter and his wife, a
29-year-old school teacher, could be home in Schertz, Texas, for
Christmas.
   ``I'm doing fine now that I know my wife is OK and my daughter,
last I heard, is doing great,'' said Smith, an assistant shipping
supervisor who was at the hospital with the couple's 3-year-old
son, Richard.

<TEXT>
   A paroled sex offender charged with the
murders of three boys pleaded innocent Tuesday.
   Westley Allan Dodd, 28, of Vancouver is being held without bail
on three counts of first-degree aggravated murder, which carries
the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence without parole.
   Dodd admitted in graphic detail to molesting and strangling
4-year-old Lee Joseph Iseli of Portland, Ore., according to an
affidavit filed in court. The boy's body was discovered Nov. 1 near
Vancouver Lake, three days after he disappeared from a schoolyard.
   Dodd also was charged with fatally stabbing Vancouver brothers
Cole Neer, 11, and William Neer, 10, whose bodies were found Sept.
4 in a park.
   Dodd was arrested Nov. 13 after he allegedly abducted a
6-year-old boy from a movie theater and was caught by the boy's
mother's boyfriend. Dodd pleaded innocent to attempted kidnapping
and attempted murder in that case.
   He showed no emotion during the hearing before Clark County
Superior Court Judge Robert Harris, who scheduled trials Jan. 22 in
the Neer deaths and Feb. 26 in the Iseli case and that of the
6-year-old boy.
   Dodd has a history of convictions for sex offenses involving
children that dates to 1982.

<HEAD>State Riverblock Searches Unconstitutional, Court Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed state officials had no right to set
up a ``riverblock'' to stop and search people canoeing on the Saco
River, Maine's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   Agents from the Department of Public Safety and the Department
of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife set up the riverblocks on three
weekends in 1988 to try to stop rowdy and illegal conduct on the
popular river in southern Maine.
   But the Supreme Court justices agreed unanimously with a lower
court judge who said the searches violated both the federal and
state constitutions.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Daniel and Jarlene
Hatfield of Rochester, N.H., who were stopped at a riverblock on
May 28, 1988, and subjected to an extensive search in which the
state agents even looked inside Daniel Hatfield's shorts. The
couple had only three cans of beer and no illegal drugs, the
justices said.
   Hatfield said he supports law enforcement on the river, as long
as authorities stop only people who give them a reason.
   ``There are things that should be stopped,'' such as excessive
drinking and scuffles, he said.
   The state acknowledged that the Hatfield search was
unconstitutional because of a lack of probable cause, but said such
incidents were ``nothing more than `isolated incidents' or
`departures' from normal, appropriate procedures.''
   But Kennebec County Superior Court Justice Donald Alexander
refused to dismiss the Hatfield search as an isolated incident and
issued a declaratory judgment that the riverblocks were illegal.
The state appealed, leading to Tuesday's ruling.
   Hatfield said Tuesday he supports law enforcement on the river,
as long as authorities stop only people who give them a reason.
   ``What made me decide to go through with this, when they
searched my pants that was uncool,'' Hatfield said. ``He pulled my
pants open and looked down inside. There wasn't much I could do.
There was no reason for them to search us.''
   Fish and Game Commissioner William Vail said he had not yet seen
the ruling, so he does not know how it will affect future law
enforcement on the Saco, which he said has more canoeists than any
other river in the region and presents a challenge to police
because no highways run parallel.
   ``We patrolled the river in 1989 without the riverblocks, and I
think we were quite successful,'' Vail said. ``I think we certainly
maintained a law enforcement presence on the river this year.''
   At each of the 1988 riverblock checkpoints, six to 10 armed
officers and one or two police dogs were stationed on the banks of
the Saco. Canoeists who were stopped were asked to show their
fishing licenses, and asked if they had any drugs or alcohol.
   ``Some officers informed canoeists that they would not be
prosecuted if they voluntarily surrendered any contraband, but
would be placed under immediate arrest if they did not voluntarily
surrender any illegal contraband and such contraband was discovered
in the course of a subsequent search,'' the justices noted.
   ``It was also routine procedure for the officers to inquire
whether they had any alcohol aboard their canoes, and if so to
identify the state in which they purchased such alcohol. The canoes
and containers in the canoes of any canoeist who admitted to having
out-of-state alcohol but who was uncertain of the amount was
searched.''
   Each riverblock detected between 20 and 50 violations, most of
them being importation of too much beer, fishing without a license
or possession of marijuana, a civil violation, the ruling said.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislator Says Kremlin Is Learning from U.S. Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Soviet legislator told a
congressional panel Tuesday that, after ``70 years of trying to
teach others how to live,'' the Kremlin is studying the lessons of
American democracy.
   Fyodor M. Burlatsky, the legislator, was the first Soviet to
testify before the Commission on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, a joint congressional-executive branch panel that has
traded shots with the Kremlin over human rights since 1976.
   Burlatsky came to Washington at the head of a seven-person
delegation to study the U.S. government, meeting with members of
Congress; Attorney General Dick Thornburgh; the chief justice of
the United States, William H. Rehnquist, and others.
   One aim of the delegation is to study non-governmental
institutions for protecting human rights, such as the American
Civil Liberties Union, said the chairmen of the U.S. panel, Sen.
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. The
assistant secretary of state for human rights, Richard Schifter,
also sits on the American panel and attended the session.
   Burlatsky said that Soviet lawmakers were watching the examples
of Poland, Hungary and East Germany in reducing the influence of
the Communist Party and in moving ``from an authoritarian society
to a democratic one. ...''
   ``During 70 years of trying to teach others how to live and what
systems to build, now we have learned that there are things we need
to learn,'' not only in the realm of technology but also in the
fields of government and human rights, he said, referring to seven
decades of communist rule in Russia.
   ``Our main aim in coming here is to study your experience, to
find new forms'' of government, he said.
   Burlatsky first rose to prominence as a speech writer for Soviet
leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, who was toppled from power in 1964.
Since then, Burlatsky has worked as a journalist and sociologist,
gaining a reputation as a liberal before Mikhail S. Gorbachev rose
to power in 1985.
   He has written speeches for Gorbachev, and has been an a
prominent advocate for democratic reforms in the Soviet Union.
   In his testimony Tuesday, Burlatsky said that the Soviet
parliament, known as the Supreme Soviet, was expected to enact by
January a long-awaited law codifying recent liberalization of
emigration laws.
   President Bush has said that passage of that law would clear the
way for him to grant the Soviet Union most-favored-nation trading
status, lowering tariffs on Soviet imports into this country.
   Burlasky, chairman of the subcommittee on humanitarian,
scientific and cultural cooperation of the international affairs
committee of the Supreme Soviet, said his panel had played a key
role in drafting the new emigration law, ensuring that every Soviet
citizen has the right to leave and return to the Soviet Union.
   ``The law will be a giant step forward in forming an open
society in our country,'' he said.
   Burlatsky read a catalogue of human rights legislation drafted
by parliament, including a law on private property, a law on
freedom of the press, a law on freedom of conscience and religion
and a bill on public organizations.

<HEAD>Vatican Suggests Ties With Kremlin on Eve of Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican on Tuesday suggested establishing
permanent ties with the Kremlin on the eve of the first visit by a
Soviet leader.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives Wednesday for a state
visit before meeting with Pope John Paul II on Friday and then
flying on to Malta for his summit meeting with President Bush.
   Although overshadowed by the events immediately following them,
the Soviet leader's talks in Italy with President Francesco Cossiga
and Premier Giulio Andreotti are expected to focus on the dramatic
changes in Eastern Europe, where Czechoslovakia has joined East
Germany, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria in breaking away from
hard-line communism.
   At the same time, the Soviet Union's flagging economy has failed
to respond to Gorbachev's attempts at reform, and an Italian
government spokesman said Italy would like to ``help the Soviet
Union overcome this embarrassing situation.'' The spokesman, Pio
Mastrobuoni, noted that more than a dozen accords are to be signed
during the visit.
   A top Vatican official said the pope plans to ask Gorbachev to
forge permanent ties between the Kremlin and the Holy See, which
has had occasional contacts since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
   After the Communists came to power, they tried to abolish
religion but succeeded only in forcing several sects, including 4
million Ukrainian Catholics, underground.
   Gorbachev's meeting with the Polish-born pontiff will be the
first between a leader of the world's Roman Catholics and a Soviet
Communist Party chief.
   The last supreme Russian leader to visit the Vatican was Czar
Nicholas I in 1845, and no Soviet party chief has ever visited
Italy.
   ``The Holy See is asking for the possibility of a type of
permanent, stable relationship,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro, indicating the issue would be among the top items on the
agenda for the private talks between Gorbachev and the pontiff.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov welcomed the
thaw in Vatican-Kremlin relations but did not comment specifically
on a possible exchange of envoys or other formal arrangement for
continuing the dialogue.
   In a statement signaling the Kremlin's desire for a
rapprochement, Gerasimov said, ``Christian values are human values,
and they are the same as socialist values.''
   Navarro said it was premature to discuss what form continuing
relations might take, but he noted the United States was
represented at the Vatican by a personal envoy of the president
before formal diplomatic relations were established in 1983.
   Also on Tuesday, the giant Fiat automobile company announced the
signing of a joint venture to produce 300,000 cars annually in the
Soviet Union, where consumers wait years to purchase an automobile.
   Nikolai A. Pugin, the Soviet minister for the automobile
industry, said Fiat was selected as ``an old friend'' to be the
Western partner in the ambitious project that envisions selling a
third of its products for export.
   In 1966, Fiat built a plant for the Soviets that is still
producing the Zhiguli and Lada models that are the core of the
Soviet civilian and export fleet. The cars have changed little in
design over the years but enjoy a reputation as being more reliable
than the Volga and Moskvich models made in other state factories.
   Cesare Romiti, the managing director of Fiat SpA, said the new
plant, to be built in Yelabuga, southeast of Moscow, would produce
small cars similar to the Fiat Panda. The first cars are expected
to roll off the assembly line in 1993 or 1994.
   The Panda sells for the equivalent of $5,280 to $6,350 in Italy,
and Soviet-built models sold for export would have to compete in
the same market. But two-thirds of the new cars are to be sold in
the Soviet Union for rubles at prices to be determined by the
Soviets, Romiti said.
   Because the ruble is not a convertible currency and has little
value outside the Soviet Union, Fiat's profits from the venture _
at least in the immediate future _ must come from exports.
   ``This is an act of faith in a new market which will develop
with new rules,'' Romiti said. He added Gorbachev will sign an
agreement Thursday that will lay out guarantees for prospective
Italian investors in the Soviet Union. He said the joint-venture
agreement with the Soviets also provides for Fiat to take its
profits out of the country, a sticking point in earlier business
talks.
   Fiat will retain only 30 percent control of the new venture,
with the Soviets holding 70 percent, but management of the new firm
won't necessarily be proportional.

<TEXT>
   A Colombian jetliner lost cabin pressure
before it was destroyed by an explosion, and the 107 people aboard
had time to don oxygen masks before they were killed, investigators
said today.
   Authorities were skeptical of claims that terrorists had caused
the explosion, but said they had not determined how the 26-year-old
plane was destroyed on Monday.
   ``The explosion might have been caused by depressurization or by
other causes,'' said Col. Jorge Aurelio Gonzalez, director of
Colombia's Civil Aviation operations. ``A depressurization ... made
the use of oxygen masks necessary.''
   The Boeing 727-100 took off Monday at 7:13 a.m. from Bogota for
Cali, a Colombian city 200 miles to the west. It crashed seven
minutes later, enveloped in flames.
   Hundreds of witnesses saw the jet disintegrate in midair and
many said there were two explosions, with flames and smoke pouring
from the plane.
   Investigators today worked at the hilly site just south of
Bogota where the Avianca Airlines jet crashed. Pieces of the plane
were found up to six miles from the main point of impact, police
said.
   Earlier, Gonzalez said investigators believed that pilots did
not have enough time to report the explosion to ground controllers.
The plane had been climbing at 4,600 feet above the valley.
   ``Given the circumstances of the crash, I would say that it was
a terrorist attack,'' a spokesman for Colombia's Pilots Association
said in an interview. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hours after the crash, a caller to the Caracol radio network
said the Extraditables, a terrorist group linked to the Medellin
cocaine cartel, had blown up the plane in order to kill six police
informants aboard.
   The caller said the informants had told police the location of
the jungle hideout of cocaine trafficker Pablo Escobar.
   Police on Nov. 22 raided the camp 70 miles east of Medellin, but
Escobar and another cartel leader, Jorge Luis Ochoa, narrowly
escaped capture.
   There was no way to check the authenticity of the call. Col.
Gustavo Leal of the national police said a terrorist attack ``could
not be ruled out.''
   ``I don't believe this accident was caused by terrorists,''
Civil Aviation Director Yezid Castano said today. But he admitted
``what happened to the plane has no explanation.''
   Daniel Eramian, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman in
Washington, said DEA investigators have discounted the telephone
caller's claim as bogus.
   Castano told Radio Caracol the plane was in perfect condition
mechanically and had been subjected to all examinations recommended
by the manufacturer, according to maintenance records.
   Gonzalez said investigators had found no traces of dynamite or
other explosives.
   He said reported indications of metal fatigue were being checked
out. The plane had made 59,139 landings in 46,000 hours of flight
time. A notebook carried by the crew said a 3-inch crack in the
fuselage had been found on Nov. 24, according to the newspaper El
Tiempo.
   Colombian officials said they would send the flight recorder to
the United States, where investigators from the Seattle-based
Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation Administration would examine it.
   Late Monday, authorities finished recovering the bodies of six
crew members and 101 passengers, many found strewn along the
hillside. Only 16 of the victims had been identified.
   At least one U.S. citizen, Andres Escabi, was among the victims,
a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. Escabi, born in Puerto Rico, also
held Colombian citizenship and lived in Bogota, the spokesman said.
   Police at the crash site said 120 people had been arrested for
looting the bodies, suitcases, packages, and mail. Several of the
looters were caught removing rings and gold chains from the
corpses, police said.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco declared war on drug
traffickers in August, and since then there have been nearly 200
bombings and other attacks that killed 29 people and wounded 236.
   None was on as large scale as Monday's plane crash.
   The Extraditables takes it name from the U.S. Justice
Department's list of 12 Colombian drug suspects most wanted in the
United States. Escobar, the reputed head of the Medellin cartel,
tops the list.
   The last major passenger jet crash in Colombia occurred March
17, 1988, when an Avianca Boeing 727-100 crashed into a mountain
near the northern city of Zulia, killing 138 people.

   Taking liver segments from healthy adults and
putting them into dying children can ease a critical shortage but
the gains cannot be justified if they come at the donors' expense,
surgeons said Tuesday.
   ``The major thing is what's the risk to the donor,'' said Dr.
Barry Kahan, president of the American Society of Transplant
Surgeons and director of transplantation at the University of Texas
at Houston, who was monitoring the nation's first living-donor
liver transplant.
   ``Before there's a wide application of this, one would like to
get an estimate of the hazard to the donor. Certainly a high
mortality rate in the donor would not give one much enthusiasm for
continuing this,'' Kahan said Tuesday.
   Surgeons at the University of Chicago Medical Center on Monday
became the first in the country to perform a living-donor liver
transplant.
   Teresa Smith, 29, a teacher from Schertz, Texas, had about a
third of her liver removed and placed into her 21-month-old
daughter, Alyssa, who had been waiting more than a year for a liver
from a brain-dead donor.
   Doctors who performed the dual operations predicted success for
Alyssa, despite additional surgery Tuesday to stop internal
bleeding. Expectations also were high for Mrs. Smith, whose spleen
was removed after the organ accidentally was damaged in surgery.
   Dr. Robert Gordon of the University of Pittsburgh, the world's
leading transplant center, said he hopes doctors are ``a little
more cautious about jumping into this'' than they have been in the
past with other medical advances.
   ``It's one thing to just give new medicine,'' Gordon said.
``It's another thing to subject healthy, living donors to a
surgical procedure without giving careful consideration to it. If
you do any harm, the negative impact would be enormous.''
   For Kahan, a 1 percent mortality rate among donating parents, or
one death in every 100 cases, would be acceptable provided the
child had a 50 percent or more chance of being alive five years
after surgery.
   The mortality rate for people donating one of their two kidneys
to ill relatives is about 0.1 percent, or one death in every 1,000
cases, according to Kahan.
   ``Liver donation is a much trickier operation,'' he said. ``And
of course, the delayed complications can be appreciably greater.''
   Despite the uncertainties, transplant specialists around the
country are hopeful the Chicago operation could turn around the
excruciating lack of livers for pre-school children.
   Of the 749 people awaiting liver transplants in the United
States on Monday, 156 were younger than age 6, according to Dr.
William Vaughn, director of research for the United Network for
Organ Sharing. Most, like Alyssa, suffer from biliary atresia, a
fatal blockage of the bile ducts.
   Experience shows as many as half the 156 children will die
waiting, according to Dr. John Najarian, chairman of the University
of Minnesota's department of surgery.
   Appalled by such figures, transplant surgeons a few years ago
began trimming livers from brain-dead adults to fit into toddlers.
Doctors then started splitting livers and transplanting each half
into a young patient.
   The procedures were possible because of the unique regenerative
ability of the liver. Additionally, livers, unlike kidneys, do not
require a tissue match between the donor and recipient.
   Doctors, on occasion, have removed about a third of a healthy
person's pancreas and transplanted it into a diabetic relative. So
far, there have been no major complications, according to Najarian,
whose team has performed more than 70 of the procedures.
   A positive part of donors who are relatives is that the
transplanted organ tends to be a closer genetic match than one
procured from a dead stranger, according to Najarian. There
consequently is more likelihood the transplanted organ will work.
   ``The major thrust still has to be getting as many cadaver
organs as possible and developing better'' anti-rejection drugs,
Gordon said.
   Many parents evidently feel the benefits outweigh any risks.
Within hours of Monday's operation, the Children's Liver Foundation
in Sherman Oaks, Calif., was swamped with calls about the procedure.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, questions the soundness of the
requests.
   ``Does informed consent mean anything when you're asking a
mother to save the life of her dying child?'' he asked. ``What
choice is there?''

<HEAD>Worksite Mammography Doubles Breast Cancer-Screening Rate, Report
Suggests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who were offered low-cost breast X-rays at
work were willing to undergo the cancer-detection procedure at more
than double the rate of women in general, a radiologist says.
   ``By offering a low-cost program at the worksite, we reduced two
of the most significant barriers _ expense and inconvenience _ that
prevent women from obtaining routine mammographic examinations,''
said Dr. Howard B. Kessler.
   In a report Monday to the 75th scientific assembly of the
Radiological Society of North America, Kessler said the program
involved taking a 32-foot mobile mammography van to 53 worksites in
Pennsylvania and four in Delaware.
   Mammographic examinations were offered to female employees and
male employees' spouses over age 35 by Bell of Pennsylvania and
Diamond State Bell, subsidiaries of Bell Atlantic Corp., he said.
   Women were charged $30 each for the standard two-view
mammograms, with the corporations paying the remaining $30 for each
procedure, said Kessler, director of breast imaging at the Fox
Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, which ran the program.
   During the first year, 3,627 women _ more than a third of the
approximately 10,000 eligible _ received mammograms at the
worksite, he said.
   From that group, 63 biopsies were recommended. Of those, nine
cancers were identified _ all in early stages _ about the same
prevalence that occurs statewide for the disease, Kessler reported.
   ``I believe nationally about 15 (percent) to 20 percent of women
in age-eligible populations seek out a screening examination,''
Kessler said.
   Breast cancer killed 40,354 U.S. women in 1986, the last year
for which figures are available. A least 19 percent of the deaths
could have been prevented with recommended mammograms, federal
researchers have estimated.
   Doctors agree that women should get mammograms according to the
following timetable, Kessler said: an initial breast X-ray between
the ages of 35 and 39; subsequent breast X-rays every two years
from ages 40 to 49; and annually after that.
   No figures were available on how many companies provide
breast-screening at work nationwide, but it's rare, said Kessler.
   Part of the success of the program outlined by Kessler was due
to the companies' commitment to promote and support mammography, he
said.
   Also, results of the screenings went to the women's private
physicians, rather than to their employers, so privacy was assured,
Kessler said.
   While many employee-insurance plans may cover the costs of
mammograms if they are used in the process of making a diagnosis,
such as by ruling out a suspicious physical sign, few plans cover
them as routine screening procedures, he said.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Rises Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit, after improving for
six months, deteriorated slightly to $27.75 billion in the third
quarter, fed by America's appetite for imported goods and by flat
exports, the government reported Tuesday.
   Analysts do not see much improvement in the near future. Imports
may drop somewhat because of a slowing U.S. economy, they say, but
exports also are likely to fall because of a strong dollar and
moderating economies overseas.
   The Commerce Department said the gap between imports and U.S.
exports edged up 0.7 percent in the July-September quarter from the
second quarter's $27.55 billion. The April-June gap deficit was the
narrowest since a $27.7 billion imbalance in the first quarter of
1985.
   Imports posted a 0.3 percent gain to a record $119.3 billion,
while exports rose only 0.2 percent to $91.6 billion, also a
record. Both imports and exports have reached record levels during
each of the last five quarters.
   But analysts worry that exports, which sustained much of the
U.S. economy last year, will remain unchanged in the months ahead.
   ``The trade report substantiates what we've already seen ...
export growth simply has flattened out after booming previously and
is a major source of the wave of weakness rippling through the U.S.
economy, particularly the manufacturing sector,'' commented Allen
Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co.
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Kleinwort Benson
Government Securities Inc. in Chicago, agreed that the pace of
exports is ``probably coming to the end of its run due to the
dollar.''
   A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive and thus less
competitive overseas, while making imported goods cheaper and thus
more attractive to American buyers.
   Kahan also suggested that ``as the (British) economy slows,
which seems likely, and some of the other industrial countries,
particuarly Japan, moderate their (economic) activity, that should
hurt our exports.''
   Sinai also said that ``as the U.S. economy weakens more, as will
probably be the case over the next few quarters, imports too will
probably decline.''
   But Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic advisor for the WEFA
Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., pointed to the high level of oil
imports, which he said will continue and further aggravate the
trade deficit.
   The Commerce Department said the average number of barrels
imported daily increased 8.5 percent to 8.65 million barrels in the
third quarter _ the highest level since the third quarter of 1977.
   But despite the increase, oil imports showed a July-September
numerical decrease of 1 percent because of lower prices. The
average price per barrel fell from $18.46 to $16.85.
   Non-oil imports rose 0.5 percent to $106 billion, led by
consumer goods, including clothing and household goods. Imports of
industrial supplies and materials fell while both capital goods and
automotive products were virtually unchanged.
   Non-farm exports increased 2 percent to a record $81.8 billion.
The sector was boosted by shipments of capital goods, including
aircraft and parts to Western Europe, Japan and newly
industrialized countries in the Far East.
   Shipments of non-farm products such as industrial supplies and
materials and automotive parts fell. Farm products also fell, down
10 percent to $9.8 billion.
   For the first nine months of the year, the overall deficit was
running at an annual rate of $111.6 billion, down 12.3 percent from
the $127.2 billion trade gap registered in all of 1988.
   Today's report on merchandise trade, which is calculated on a
balance of payment basis, is slightly different from the Commerce
Department's monthly merchandise trade reports because it excludes
U.S. military sales to foreign governments and makes other minor
adjustments in the monthly figures.

<TEXT>
   Federal banking regulators have begun foreclosure
proceedings on an office building owned by former Gov. Evan Mecham,
who uses the building as his headquarters.
   Mecham owes $461,864 on a $406,000 mortgage he took out from
North American Bank of Phoenix on Dec. 30, 1985, before the bank
failed and was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The amount Mecham owes exceeds the original loan amount because
he is behind on the $4,200-a-month payments. Mecham said he had
made payments on the building but confirmed he is behind. He
disputed the amount the FDIC said he owes.
   ``I'll arrange something with them,'' Mecham said. ``I don't
know where they get their figures. They haven't done me the
courtesy of giving me their accounting.''
   Mecham has until the day of the sale, Feb. 23, to work out an
agreement with the FDIC and said ``I don't anticipate losing the
property.''
   Mecham said he used the mortgage money to pay for remodeling and
moving his office into the building after his ouster from the
governor's office. The building serves as his gubernatorial
campaign headquarters but has found few other tenants.
   The one-story building covers 7,300 square feet and was
estimated to be worth $512,289 in 1984, according to county records.
   Mecham wracked up hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting his
impeachment, a criminal charge and a recall election effort last
year and continues to pile up new bills while he fights to get his
impeachment overturned and seeks re-election next year.
   ``I'm a million and half (dollars) out of what I used to have.
It's cost me a lot of money, what's happened in the last two
years,'' he said.
   But he also said he was ``not in trouble'' financially and that
his campaign would not be effected by the foreclosure.
   Mecham campaign spokesman Max Hawkins said he could not comment
on the foreclosure, but believed the Legislature was slowing
Mecham's comeback by refusing to pay his recall campaign expenses
or legal fees incurred from his impeachment.

<HEAD>Centrist Opposition Moves to Form Gov't But Divisions Surface</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A centrist opposition alliance moved
Tuesday to form India's first minority government since
independence, but divisions began to surface among potentional
supporters.
   The Congress Party of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi could
conceivably try to form a coalition, but it said it will become the
opposition as the National Front attempts to form a government.
   The Congress Party, which has led the government for all but 2{
years since India gained independence from Britain in 1947, won
more parliamentary seats than any single party in elections that
ended Sunday. But it fell far short of a majority.
   ``That is the verdict of the people,'' said party spokesman
Anand Sharma.
   ``We sat in the opposition once before and we can do it again,''
said Arjun Singh, a powerful Congress Party boss, referring to the
1977 election loss. After 29 turbulent months, that government fell
apart and Congress returned to power.
   The centrist National Front alliance expressed confidence it
could form the next government.
   ``The people of India want a non-Congress government to replace
the corrupt and inefficient Congress government. It is therefore
the sacred duty of the National Front to respect this mandate,''
the National Front said in a statement read by its chief spokesman,
Dinesh Goswamy.
   The National Front said its new Parliament members would meet
Wednesday to select their choice for prime minister. Among the
leading candidates were three former Congress members: Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, Ramakrishna Hegde and Chandra Shekhar.
   The front's strategy is to opt for a minority government with
the tacit support of an array of parties ranging from the
Communists to Hindu fundamentalists.
   Opposition parties have been plagued by highly publicized
internal feuds. But they set aside their differences several months
ago to unite and oust Gandhi's government, alleging corruption and
ineptitude.
   Differences among the parties started to emerge Tuesday when the
right-wing India People's Party said it would not support any
government that included communist parties.
   With 473 of the 525 seats declared, the Congress Party and its
allies had 202 seats, according to state-run TV. Gandhi was ahead
in his own race for re-election to Parliament, leading by more than
135,000 votes over opponent Raj Mohan Gandhi, the grandson of
India's beloved independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi.
   The National Front had 115 seats and the Indian People's Party
81. The Communist and leftist parties had 44.
   Together those seats would give the National Front and its
allies 240 spots, but the front could be hard-pressed to preserve
such an ideologically diverse group.
   The remaining seats were held by smaller, regional parties and
independent candidates. The winners included the father and the
widow of Beant Singh, one of the gunmen who killed Gandhi's mother
and predecessor, Indira Gandhi, and the man suspected of
masterminding her assassination.
   Seating of a new government began Monday night when President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman dissolved Parliament.
   The president normally would ask the party with the most seats
to try to form a government, but the constitution does not
specifically require this.
   Rather than rush into a coalition attempt of his own, however,
Gandhi appeared willing to wait to see whether the National Front
would founder in its efforts.
   ``The alliance, if any, will be ill-matched and bound to result
in a divorce sooner or later,'' said Murlidhar Bhandare, a Congress
Party lawmaker. The party was to meet Wednesday to elect a
parliamentary leader. That post and party president are separate,
although one person can hold both.
   Asked if Gandhi would offer to resign as party president because
of the election losses, party spokesman Sharma said: ``The question
does not arise. All party men have affirmed their full faith in
Gandhi's leadership.''
   Gandhi was swept into power in December 1984 on a wave of
sympathy following the assassination of his mother two months
earlier.
   But support for him declined in the face of allegations of
government corruption. Gandhi has denied any wrongdoing.

   The man accused of causing the nation's
worst drunken-driving disaster broke down in tears for a third day
as a coroner today described seeing the charred bodies inside a
church bus where 27 people died.
   Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite ordered a recess after Larry
Mahoney began sobbing during county Coroner James B. Dunn's
testimony.
   ``I couldn't believe what I had seen,'' Dunn testified. ``I
thought I was having a nightmare.''
   Mahoney, 36, also broke into tears Monday as witnesses described
the screams and agony of the injured and dying. He also wept
earlier when the murder trial began last week.
   Dunn was describing what he saw when he entered the former
school bus shortly after the fiery 1988 crash on Interstate 71
south of Carrollton. He said about 17 children were sprawled in the
aisle and on seats in the rear of the bus.
   The bus, owned by Radcliff First Assembly of God Church, was
returning from an outing at an amusement park north of Cincinnati.
Sixty-three youngsters and four adults were aboard. Three adults
and 24 youngsters were killed.
   William Summers, Mahoney's lead attorney, said Monday that
``time will tell'' how Mahoney holds up when children who survived
the crash testify.
   In other testimony today, State Police Sgt. Jim Sharon compared
what he saw at the crash to carnage he witnessed in Vietnam.
   ``Bodies were black and charred, skin burned, and (emergency
medical technicians) were working on them,'' Sharon said of the
victims lying on a median strip.
   The first police officer to reach the accident testified Monday
that he found cold beer inside Mahoney's pickup, which rammed the
bus head-on while traveling the wrong way on the interstate.
   A paramedic also said the remainder of a 12-pack of Miller Lite
beer was still cold on the floor of the truck.
   Mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42
of wanton endangerment and one of drunken driving.
   Robert Strong, a former state trooper, said he was the first
emergency official to reach the crash but couldn't get close enough
to help in a rescue.
   ``It was an intense _ you might say inferno,'' said Strong. ``I
was actually, verbally praying that there wasn't anyone left on the
bus.''
   Mahoney was still pinned in the cab of his pickup, an opened
12-pack of beer on the floor, Strong said.
   One can of beer was open, Strong said. He said he could feel two
other cans inside the carton, still cold.
   Tommy Webb, a paramedic, said he saw three cans of beer in the
crushed cab as he struggled to give first aid to Mahoney, who was
pinned by the crumpled dashboard.
   Jack Armstrong of Patriot, Ind., testified that he and his wife,
Joan, had seen Mahoney driving in the wrong lanes for about two
miles before the crash.
   ``My wife screamed, `Oh my God, that's a school bus,'' recalled
Armstrong, who like his wife was once a school bus driver.

   Sen. Edward Kennedy on Tuesday visited the
spot of his brother's famous speech denouncing the Berlin Wall, and
he said the barrier's opening will lead to the reunification of
Germany.
   He also laid two white lilies on the steps of West Berlin's
Schoeneberg City Hall, where President John F. Kennedy stood on
June 26, 1963, and declared: ``Ich bin ein Berliner,'' _ ``I am a
Berliner.''
   During a one-day visit, the Massachsetts Democrat also met in
West Berlin with East German opposition groups, including New
Forum. The West Berlin city government said the groups told Kennedy
that reforms in their homeland were being overshadowed by West
German-led debate on reunification.
   ``I think that is an inevitable course of history,'' Kennedy
said after crossing briefly into East Berlin for talks with
Lutheran church leaders. ``The question of timing and the rest ...
these are questions that really have to be determined by the people
in these communities.''
   Kennedy also laid flowers at the Reichstag in East Berlin in
tribute to the more than 80 people killed trying to escape after
East Germany built the wall in 1961.
   East German border guards stared silently as the senator walked
alongside the wall and looked at spots where souvenir hunters have
chipped away pieces of concrete.
   East Germany, bowing to a citizens uprising demanding reforms,
lifted travel restrictions and opened the wall and other borders on
Nov. 9.
   In a welcoming ceremony at Schoeneberg City Hall, Kennedy said:
``I come here today, on behalf of my family and country, on a
journey of memory and hope.''
   ``You have opened the way to a new world of freedom,'' he said.
``Today, in that world of freedom, the proudest boast is `Ich bin
ein Berliner.''''
   He was flanked by former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt,
who as West Berlin mayor accompanied President Kennedy in 1963.
   ``The peaceful men and women moving by the thousands through
Checkpoint Charlie are at the center of the greatest march of
liberty of modern times _ and perhaps of all time,'' the senator
said.
   ``Many assumed the concrete could never be breached, the stones
never thrown down, the Iron Curtain never lifted. Lass sie nach
Berlin kommen. Let them come to Berlin,'' he added, echoing his
brother's words once again.
   Many West Berlin residents remember John F. Kennedy's words
fondly, and the city has honored the slain president with a plaque
at city hall.

<HEAD>US Rejects Restrictions On Naval Power At Summit</HEAD>

   The United States has little interest in any
possible Soviet proposal at the Malta summit to restrict naval
power because such a step would hamper America's security and its
ability to protect its allies, the State Department said Tuesday.
   ``The Soviet Union, a land power, would be less constrained by
such proposals'' than would the United States, said spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler, adding, ``We are not aware of naval arms control
measures that enhance stability.''
   The comments came as the Pentagon reported that the Soviets will
have four warships capable of carrying nuclear weapons in the
Mediterranean during this weekend's summit, contrary to a report
that Moscow was withdrawing such ships in anticipation of a
possible initiative to declare the region a nuclear-free zone.
   Ms. Tutwiler, asked about reports that the Soviets might use the
meeting between President Bush and and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to push a new initiative on naval arms control, said the
Soviets ``may seek to make a virtue of necessity by proposing
constraints related to limitations on their own naval deployments.''
   The spokeswoman noted that U.S. officials have observed a
worldwide downturn in Sovet naval activity for some time and that
it apparently is due to operational problems and budget restraints.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States has no indication that the
Soviets intend to propose any naval cuts at the summit.
   She stressed that the United States depends on freedom of the
seas to protect its security and commercial interests, to
demonstrate its support for its allies and to deter war.
   ``We have opposed Soviet proposals for naval arms control
because they would hamper our ability to honor our commitments to
our allies and carry out our global responsibility,'' she said.
   At the Pentagon, officials reported that the Mediterranean will
be bristling with U.S. and Soviet naval power during the seawater
summit, with four Soviet nuclear-capable combat ships and three
times as many such U.S. vessels in the region.
   ``The Soviet Union is expected to have four nuclear-capable
combatants and four auxiliaries in the Med during the Malta
meeting,'' spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters.
   Hoffman said the Soviet group is expected to include three
guided-missile frigates, the Slava guided-missile cruiser _ which
will be the site of talks on Saturday between Bush and Gorbachev _
and four support vessels.
   Such ships are normally armed with a variety of missiles,
including the SS-N-12 anti-ship cruise missile, the SA-N-6 air
defense missile and the SS-N-14 anti-submarine missile, said
another Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Ken Satterfield.
   The Navy is expected to have 25 ships in the Mediterranean
during the summit. That includes the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal
and the dozen destroyers, cruisers and frigates that compose its
battle group.
   Also in the area is an amphibious ready group composed of five
ships ready to deploy some 2,400 Marines, said a Navy spokesman,
Cmdr. Craig Quigley.
   Of the U.S. ships, 11 can carry nuclear weapons, Satterfield
said.
   Hoffman, asked whether the U.S. ships would be so armed, refused
to say.
   ``We neither confirm nor deny the existence of such weapons,''
he said.
   A defense official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said
the Soviets ``still have a submarine presence'' in the
Mediterranean and are expected to continue to do so through the
shipboard summit.
   The two leaders are scheduled to share a dinner Saturday night
aboard the U.S. host vessel, the USS Belknap, the guided-missile
cruiser that is a command ship for the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the
Mediterranean.

   Pennsylvania Auditor General Barbara Hafer
has joined the ranks of announced candidates seeking the Republican
nomination for governor in 1990.
   The former registered nurse, who has had a 13-year political
career, made her formal announcement Monday at a rally in her
hometown, a Pittsburgh suburb.
   As a nurse, she said, she learned to take a pulse and she has
done the same with public sentiment. ``Pennsylvania wants a new
choice, a new leader, a better way of doing things,'' she said.
   Incumbent Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey is expected to seek
re-election but has not made an announcement.
   The Republican State Committee meets Saturday to endorse a
candidate for the May primary. Also seeking backing are James O.
Pickard of Lancaster, a commerce secretary in Gov. Dick
Thornburgh's Cabinet, and former state Rep. John Kennedy of
suburban Harrisburg.
   Hafer, 46, already has the support of top Republican Party
leaders, including U.S. Sens. John Heinz and Arlen Specter.
   Party conservatives say she is too liberal, and they especially
dislike her pro-choice stand on abortion, an issue some observers
think will be a key in the contest.

   An irate woman allegedly held her
daughter's eighth-grade class at gunpoint for 20 minutes, claiming
her daughter had been harassed by boys at the school.
   No one was injured in Monday's incident at Gloster Elementary
School in southwest Mississippi.
   Roxie W. Monk, 36, surrendered to police and was being held in
lieu of $5,000 bail Tuesday on a charge of aggravated assault,
officials said.
   Officers said Monk held a loaded shotgun on teacher Lee Anderson
and about 30 students, trying to find the boys bothering her
14-year-old daughter and make them leave her alone.
   Amite County Sheriff Gerald Wall said one boy reportedly stood
during the incident, admitted to harrassing Monk's daughter and
apologized.
   Police Officer Tom Poster took the gun from the woman, whom he
described as ``upset, but not hysterical.''
   ``I opened the door (to the classroom) and stepped in. She was
standing right inside the door and I just took the gun out of her
hands,'' Poster said. ``She didn't resist.''

   The State Department on Tuesday condemned the

to cling to power.''
   Cochez and Artola had been in the United States to attend the

   ``We condemn this outrageous act and call for their immediate
release,'' the statement said.
   The Panamanian government has not announced the arrests but the

<HEAD>FDA OKs Fast-Acting Clot-Dissolving Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved a new drug that quickly dissolves blood clots to prevent
permanent damage following a heart attack.
   The drug, called anistreplase, is the third clot-dissolving drug
to be approved.
   Its advantage is that it can be administered in five minutes or
less while the other two must be administered continuously for one
to three hours, according to SmithKline Beecham, which will market
the drug as Eminase.
   Although clot-dissolving drugs can open blocked arteries and
limit damage from heart attacks, they are used in only 20 percent
or so of the estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients who could
benefit from treatment each year, according to the Department of
Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA.
   More than 300,000 of the 1.5 million people who suffer heart
attacks each year die before getting to the hospital and an
additional 300,000 get there too late for treatment with
clot-dissolving drugs, the department said in announcing the FDA
action.
   ``Ease and convenience of administration of anistreplase
hopefully will lead to greater use of this life-saving thrombolytic
therapy even in emergency rooms and small hospitals not equipped
with sophisticated coronary care facilities,'' said HHS Secretary
Louis Sullivan.
   A blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is the
most common cause of heart attacks. The clot prevents blood from
carrying oxygen to the heart muscle, which can lead to heart
failure and death.
   The other two approved clot-dissolving drugs are alteplase, or
TPA, and streptokinase.

<HEAD>Gov't Appears to Give Control of Disputed Region Back to Azerbaijan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet parliament Tuesday approved a plan that
apparently gave control of the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh back to Azerbaijan, but it also ordered the
republic to work closely with the Armenian majority in the region.
   Armenian deputies walked out of the hall when the directive on
the Nagorno-Karabakh region appeared at a closed legislative
meeting on the final day of the Supreme Soviet's fall session.
   The neighboring republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia have been
waging a bloody dispute over the region, which is located entirely
within the borders of Moslem Azerbaijan but whose population of
124,000 mainly Christian Armenians outnumber Azerbaijanis by a 4-1
ratio.
   A special Kremlin commission was formed in January to get
control of the region, where more than 60 people have died in
ethnic clashes since February 1988.
   The directive that was passed by the legislature eliminated the
commission, which was headed by Arkady Volsky.
   ``Nobody wanted to talk about it, no one understood it,'' said
Zuri Balayan, an ethnic Armenian from Nagorno-Karabakh, in a
telephone interview. He was one of the deputies who walked out of
the hall.
   Nevertheless, it passed by a wide margin. Balayan said more than
350 deputies voted for it, only four voted against it and 20
abstained.
   Asked what the likely effect of the directive will be, Balayan
said only, ``We'll wait and see.''
   The dispute has been one of the sources of continuous tension
between the two Caucasus republics, in the southern part of the
Soviet Union, and despite the presence of soldiers some reports
have warned of a virtual state of civil war. Some officials have
compared the unrest in the region to that in Lebanon.
   The directive, distributed by the Tass news agency, ordered the
Azerbaijan government ``in the shortest period of time to approve
legislative measures guaranteeing the heightening of the status of
real autonomy, working guarantees to the Armenian population of the
Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, observance of the law,
protection of life and safety of citizens, constitutional decision
of all the problems that arise.''
   It ordered officials in Azerbaijan to work with reinstated local
officials in Nagorno-Karabakh to write a new law guaranteeing the
region ``full development in all spheres of government, economic
and culture on the basis of self-management, self-financing,
territorial self-accounting, and freedom of economic and cultural
ties.''
   Armenians have dominated much of the local government in
Nagorno-Karabakh, which was suspended when direct rule by Volsky
was imposed Jan. 12.
   It was uncertain how the Kremlin expected the polarized
leaderships and population of the area to solve the problem, but it
was clear that officials believed it useless to continue direct
rule from Moscow.
   The Volsky commission was abolished and replaced by another
commission under the supervision of the legislature, which the
directive said would oversee the work. Soldiers of the Soviet
Interior Ministry will remain in Nagorno-Karabakh and obey the new
commission, the directive said.
   The directive did not say who would be in charge of the new
commission, or exactly what its powers would be.
   The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh brought hundreds of thousands
of people into the streets of cities in both Armenia and Azerbaijan
in February 1988. In its first effort to control the tension and
address Armenia charges of intention Azerbaijani neglect, the
Kremlin approved a multimillion-ruble plan to improve cultural and
economic conditions.
   Local officials were ordered in the Supreme Soviet directive to
ensure that no one tries to move settlers into Nagorno-Karabakh to
change the demographic patterns. A special commission was set up to
deal with the thousands of refugees who have fled violence in the
area.

   Anti-nuclear activists from
Greenpeace USA will try to halt the launch of a Trident 2 missile
from a submarine off the Florida coast, which they said is
scheduled Friday, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   ``Coming on the eve of the Mediterranean summit, this test is a
slap in the face to the world's hopes and expectations for
meaningful arms reductions,'' said Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon
Fagan.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet
Saturday and Sunday off the island of Malta in the Mediterranean.
   The Navy refused to confirm or deny that it planned a Trident 2
launch Friday.
   Greenpeace was successful in stopping a Trident 2 test from the
nuclear submarine Tennessee last July 28, maneuvering small Zodiac
rafts close enough to the sub to attach ``Nuclear Free Seas'' flags
to its hull and mast.
   The anti-nuclear activists left the area, declaring they had
made their point that the Trident 2 should be eliminated as a
weapons system, and the Navy was able to launch the missile five
days later.
   That was the only success in three submarine test-launches. The
other two ended in explosions just seconds after the missiles
cleared the ocean surface.
   In Washington, a government source said the Bush administration
might delay the test until after the summit. ``Discussions are
going on as to whether to delay it until after Malta,'' said one
source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Trident 2, at $26.5 million a copy, is designed to replace
the Trident 1 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Each
44-foot-long, three-stage Trident 2 can deliver as many as 12
nuclear warheads to individual targets up to 6,000 miles away.

   The white, gold and red flag atop Hradcany castle
indicates the president is in town.
   But since a peaceful, countrywide revolt against Communist rule,
no word has been heard from the head of a state that is swept by
crisis.
   At 76, Gustav Husak must be a bitter man in the sprawling castle
that dominates Prague and was the seat of an empire 600 years ago.
   He was stripped of his seat in the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo on Friday. He has been the target of derisive jeers from
hundreds of thousands, and he must be aware of growing popular
demands that the man he once called a ``traitor'' replace him.
   The name most often chanted by demonstrators as their favorite
to succeed him is that of Alexander Dubcek, the best-known figure
in the short-lived ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 that was turned into
winter by a Moscow-led invasion.
   Husak, himself a one-time victim of Stalinist purges in the
1950s returned from oblivion in 1968, rising to the post deputy
premier.
   But he steered a cautious middle course between Dubcek's
reformers and the conservative elements in the party. Such tactics
were rewarded by Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader who had
ordered the invasion.
   Unlike Dubcek and his closest associates, Husak never was
summoned to Moscow following the invasion. And he missed, allegedly
for lack of transport and communications, taking part in an
emergency Communist Party congress that branded the invasion
illegal.
   Only once does he seem to have been carried away by the wave of
nationalism in the country after the Soviet tanks rolled into
Prague. ``I stand and fall with Dubcek,'' he stated, words cited
ever since by his critics.
   Dubcek was allowed by the Soviets to hang on until April 1969
but then Husak replaced him as party chief. In 1975 he became
president of Czechoslovakia as well, capping an ambition-filled
career.
   Since then, Husak was twice re-elected, with his third term due
to end in June 1990.
   After Dubcek, whom he had expelled from the party in 1970,
criticized the new leadership, Husak publicly denounced him as a
``traitor of communism and Czechoslovakia.''
   Dubcek was never arrested or charged. Some credit Husak for
that, saying he recalled the nine years he spent in jail on
political charges.
   For many years, Dubcek remained in seclusion, employed by the
forestry service in Slovakia, the native state of both himself and
Husak. But last week, he rose from oblivion, addressing giant
pro-democracy demonstrations in Prague where hundreds of thousands
chanted his name.
   ``Dubcek to the castle,'' they shouted. Another slogan,
addressed to Gustav Husak , was ``Gustl, look what a big crowd we
are.''
   ``Dubcek had nothing new to say,'' said Martin Palous, a member
of the Civic Forum opposition group. ``It was just the old jargon
when he spoke. But as president he would be an important symbolic
link between the past and the future.''
   On the vast, but almost empty square in front of Hradcany
Castle, groups of Soviet and Yugoslav tourists were told of the
building's history.
   A Czech who carried the tricolor ribbon identifying him as a
sympathizer of the pro-democracy movement, said: ``Husak? He is
old, he can hardly walk, he had a stroke. And he will be out soon.''
   ``Can you in the West imagine that a president keeps silent at a
moment like this ?,'' asked Roman Polak, a fellow supporter of
reform.
   Asked whether he had heard of Husak recently, Polak shook his
head.
   ``Everything (is) normal up there,'' he said, pointing to the
castle.

<HEAD>Oil-Leaking Cargo Ship to Remain Grounded in Bering Sea Until Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greek cargo ship that ran aground and
spewed more than 237,000 gallons of fuel and oil into the Bering
Sea will remain there until spring because it is too dangerous to
move it.
   Until then no attempt will be made to remove the 140,000 gallons
of oil still in the ship's tanks, despite the threat of more
leakage if winter storms and icing further damage the ship,
officials said Monday.
   Coast Guard Capt. Richard Asaro, the federal cleanup
coordinator, also said no spill cleanup or rescue of oiled birds
will be attempted. The remote location, temperatures in the low
20s, strong winds and seas swelling eight to 15 feet make such
efforts too dangerous, he said.
   On Sunday, a diver surveying damage to the ship's hull was
trapped briefly in a depression on the sea floor when the 485-foot
Milos Reefer rolled to one side, Asaro said. About five minutes
later, however, the ship rolled to the other side and freed diver
John Whitekettle, who was unhurt, Asaro said.
   Asaro said the two Coast Guard vessels at the site will remain
just long enough for officials to complete their survey.
   The ship ran aground Nov. 14 on a reef off St. Matthew Island in
the Bering Sea National Wildlife Refuge 400 miles west of Bethel.
The cause of the grounding remains under investigation.
   The weather improved enough during the weekend to allow
officials to board the ship and determine how much oil remained.
   Asaro said that of 237,343 gallons that leaked, about 170,000
was intermediate fuel oil and the rest was diesel. Environmental
officials are most concerned about the fuel oil, which has the
consistency of molasses.
   Bruce Erickson, western Alaska supervisor for the state
Department of Environmental Quality, said the fuel oil is washing
up on beaches and poses a threat to marine life, including the
area's blue crab population.
   Most of what remains on board the ship is fuel oil, about
112,000 gallons. The rest, about 29,000 gallons, are various
lubrication oils used to run the ship, Asaro said.
   ``There is still some occasional leakage,'' he said. ``We're
talking a sheen as distinct from slicks.''
   Erickson said a coat of oil 20 feet wide and four to five inches
deep is spread along about a mile of the island beach. Four oiled
bird carcasses were found on the beach, while sea lions and a fox
seen on the island appeared unaffected, he said. Overall there
appeared to be little wildlife in the area.
   Pack ice, which forms over that area of the Bering Sea by
mid-January, could move and further damage the ship, trapping any
additional oil that leaks. That would pose a lingering threat to
the island's birds, most of which probably will return in the
spring before the ice melts, Erickson said.

   The editor of an unofficial Siberian journal was
sentenced to three years in a labor camp Tuesday, activists said,
in a case that has drawn the attention of Andrei D. Sakharov and
other human rights campaigners.
   Sergei Kuznetsov was found guilty of slandering a local Interior
Ministry official and resisting arrest in the Siberian city of
Sverdlovsk, said Andrei Mironov, a Moscow-based journalist and
human rights activist.
   Human rights activists say the charges were trumped up to
silence Kuznetsov, 32.
   He is editor of his own unofficial journal as well as a
contributor to some of the best-known non-official publications
that have sprung up in Moscow in the freer atmosphere of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   Mironov said the trial showed that despite Gorbachev's reforms
that freed hundreds of political prisoners, ``the system of
repression has been preserved.''
   Kuznetsov attended his trial lying down because of a prolonged
hunger strike against the accusations, Mironov said.
   Several weeks ago, Moscow activists quoted Kuznetsov's lawyer as
saying the editor had been pushed down a flight of stairs at the
Sverdlovsk courthouse by police after a court hearing.
   Sakharov and other human rights activists issued a protest after
that, and Mironov on Tuesday quoted the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize
winner as saying he could not support an international human rights
conference in the Soviet Union in 1991 if Kuznetsov was imprisoned.

<HEAD>Authorities Cutting Tree To Find Bullet in Unsolved 1956 Double Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities plan to cut down a
150-year-old cottonwood tree in hopes of finding a bullet that
might shed light on an unsolved double murder 33 years ago.
   Cascade County Sheriff Barry Michelotti said investigators hope
to find the bullet that killed 18-year-old Lloyd Bogle, whose body
was found near the tree on Jan. 3, 1956, along a dirt road that was
a lovers' lane of the era.
   The body of his 16-year-old girlfriend, Patricia Kalitzke, was
found the next day seven miles away.
   Both had been shot in the head and the bullet that killed Bogle
was missing.
   ``The tree ... has always been of major interest to law
enforcement officers because that's where he was killed _ right at
the tree,'' Michelotti said.
   Michelotti said police are cutting down the tree now because
they had talked about it for years and finally decided to do it.
   Recovery of the bullet would enable authorities to determine the
caliber of the murder weapon, the sheriff said. There even is a
possibility the bullet could be matched with a weapon seized
sometime over the last 33 years in another crime.
   Efforts to X-ray the tree failed because of its size and
density, said Sgt. Dick Duncan, an investigator on the case.
   The sheriff said the tree _ 80 feet tall, with a trunk 4{ feet
in diameter _ will be cut down and 33 growth rings will be shaved
off its lower section.
   ``Once we hit the 33-year mark on the tree, we should see an
entry if the bullet went into the tree _ a hole, a tunnel,''
Michelotti said.

<HEAD>FBI to Begin Random Drug Testing of Employees Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William S. Sessions told the
bureau's employees that random testing for possible use of illegal
drugs may begin early next year, the bureau said Tuesday.
   Sessions informed the bureau's 9,700 agents and nearly 13,000
support personnel of the random testing program in a notice dated
Nov. 14, said FBI spokesman Mike Kortan.
   The random testing is expected to begin sometime after Jan. 14,
Kortan said.
   Under the plan, a computer program will be used to randomly
select the names of employees who will be required to undergo urine
testing to determine if they have used illegal drugs, Kortan said.
   Employees who test positive for illegal drug use could be
suspended or dismissed from their jobs but ``each case would be
evaluated individually in the context of all the circumstances,''
Kortan said.
   Refusal to provide a urine sample would also result in
disciplinary action that could include dismissal, he said.
   The random testing at the FBI is being started under a 1986
executive order by President Reagan to kick off his initiative for
a drug-free workplace.
   A number of federal agencies have instituted similar programs,
which have met with mixed reviews in court decisions resulting from
lawsuits filed by affected employees.
   The Justice Department is seeking Supreme Court review of an
appellate court decision that restricted testing of career lawyers
in Washington to those with access to top-secret information. Those
lawyers, in turn, have asked the high court to review the same
decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here.
   So far, no Justice Department attorney has been tested under the
program unveiled in 1988. But the department recently began testing
job applicants, said department spokeswoman Amy Brown.
   Since 1986, the bureau has tested FBI job applicants for drug
use. In 1987, the bureau began testing new agents during their
one-year probationary period, Kortan said.
   In addition, the bureau tests volunteers as well as employees
suspected of illegal drug use.
   As of Nov. 21, 9,540 employees or applicants were tested and
only 34 showed evidence of drug use, Koran said. Figures on the
number of employees dismissed as a result of positive tests were
not available, Kortan said.
   Sessions also announced that he had established a program to
assist all employees with substance abuse, Kortan said.

   ABC can thank the Thanksgiving holiday for
putting ``Roseanne'' back in first place in the Nielsen television
ratings for the week ended Nov. 26.
   ``Roseanne'' was first and ``The Wonder Years'' was second as
NBC's strongest night, Thursday, suffered from holiday tune out.
``Coach,'' which made its debut behind ``Roseanne'' in place of
``Chicken Soup,'' tied for eighth place.
   No NBC Thursday show made the Top 10. ``Cheers'' was 13th and a
rerun of ``The Cosby Show,'' first in recent weeks, was 14th.
``L.A. Law'' tied for 17th, ``A Different World'' tied for 22nd and
``Dear John'' tied for 25th.
   Although NBC had only two shows in the Top 10, ``Empty Nest''
and ``The Golden Girls,'' it still won the week. Viewership for the
entire week was down by about 2 million households.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
13.8. The previous week NBC had an average of 16.0. ABC was second
with 12.9 and CBS was third with 12.3. The ratings represents the
percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television households tuned
to a show.
   Here are the Top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne''; ABC's ``The Wonder
Years''; CBS' ``60 Minutes''; ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''; NBC's
``The Golden Girls''; NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and CBS' ``Murder, She
Wrote'' tied; CBS National League Football Sunday overrun and ABC's
``Coach'' tied; ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos''; and ABC's
NFL Monday Night Football, tied.
   NBC leads in both the season-to-date ratings and in the November
sweeps. In the first 10 weeks of the season, NBC is ahead with
15.0, ABC is second with 13.5 and CBS is third with 12.4.
   Here are the ratings for the sweeps: Arbitron (another ratings
service) for 26 days, NBC 15.0, ABC 12.8, CBS 12.0. Nielsen for 25
days, NBC 15.1, ABC 12.6, CBS 12.1.
   The CBS special ``50 Years of Television'' was in 27th place for
the week.
   ABC and CBS tied for first place among the evening news shows,
which also had a loss of viewers because of the holiday. ABC and
CBS registered a rating of 10.0, while NBC had 9.3
   The lowest rated show of the week was ABC's ``PrimeTime Live.''
The five bottom network shows were: CBS' ``Grammys' Living
Legends,'' NBC's ``Sister Kate,'' ABC's ``Living Dolls,'' ABC's
``Mission: Impossible'' and ``PrimeTime Live.''

<HEAD>Judge Denies Hinckley Request for News Interviews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday denied a request by
presidential assailant John Hinckley to be interviewed by news
organizations, saying Hinckley's mental illness could worsen with
public exposure.
   U.S. District Court Judge June Green rejected Hinckley's request
for up to two interviews per month with the news media, starting
with ABC-TV and The Washington Post.
   A directive at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington prohibiting
personal interviews between maximum-security patients and the news
media ``embodies a reasonable and constitutionally valid'' approach
with regard to Hinckley, said the judge.
   The directive, the judge noted, permits patients to correspond
with reporters by mail. Hinckley has done so in the past.
   Hinckley, found not guilty by reason of insanity in the March
1981 assassination attempt on then-President Reagan, has been a
patient at St. Elizabeths since August 1982. Three months ago, he
filed a motion saying his First Amendment right of free speech was
being violated.
   The judge said that testimony by Dr. Raymond Patterson, a
forensic psychiatrist, established that Hinckley's personality ``is
particularly vulnerable to reinforcement through media contact,
resulting in exacerbation of his illness generally.''
   Hinckley's attorney, Mark Lane, said he would consult with his
client on Wednesday before deciding whether to appeal.
   ``The U.S. government is continuing to prevent Mr. Hinckley from
telling the American people what he knows about events of national
importance,'' said Lane.
   The events include ``the total lack of presidential security,
the ease with which he secured a weapon to shoot the president and
the fact that he was a victim of legal drugs prescribed regularly
for him by a psychiatrist'' before the assassination attempt, said
the lawyer.
   ``I understand that many people have difficulty with the concept
that Mr. Hinckley was acquitted, that he was found not guilty,''
said Lane. ``It is disturbing to find that a U.S. District Court
judge also has difficulty understanding that concept.''
   At a court hearing in September, Patterson testified that
Hinckley suffers from narcissistic personality disorder and that
approving Hinckley's request for personal interviews with the media
would be harmful to his therapy.
   Hinckley said after his arrest that he attempted the
assassination in an effort to attract actress Jodie Foster.
   He shows ``continued intense interest'' in the actress, the
judge said. ``Letters written by Mr. Hinckley ... and articles
recovered from his room ... reflect Mr. Hinckley's habit of
retaining dozens of photographs of Ms. Foster, some nude, and
regularly seeking more of them,'' she said.
   Hinckley described himself in a 1986 letter as the ``successor''
to Hitler and linked Hitler to mass murderer Charles Manson.
Hinckley called Manson ``one cool dude'' in a 1988 letter.
   White House press secretary James Brady was left partially
paralyzed in the 1981 shootings, in which a Secret Service agent
and Washington police officer were wounded as well as the president.

<HEAD>Jury Has One Verdict, Deadlocked on One, Still Debating</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors in the 2{-year-old McMartin preschool
molestation trial returned one verdict under seal Tuesday but
indicated they are deadlocked on one of the 65 molestation counts
against two defendants.
   ``They've said only that they've taken several ballots and
cannot reach a verdict on a count,'' said Superior Court Judge
William Pounders. ``Given the fact there are 65 counts, that is not
too significant.''
   Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63,
are charged with conspiracy and child molestation at their
family-owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. Their trial is the
longest in U.S. history and has cost Los Angeles County over $15
million.
   Jurors have been deliberating since Nov. 2.
   The judge has instructed the jurors to give him each verdict,
once it is final, sealed in an envelope. He said he would begin
reading the verdicts as early as next week even if all 65 charges
had not been decided.
   The jury's predicament came to light when they sent a note to
the judge asking if a deadlock should be submitted as a sealed
verdict.
   Pounders told the jurors they should not seal any non-decision.
   ``You do give us only the final decisions you make, the
unanimous decisions,'' he said.
   The panelists then returned to their jury deliberation room, and
within about two minutes they buzzed for the court clerk who
returned with a single verdict they had given him to seal in an
envelope.
   The unusual process, the judge said, is warranted by the unique
nature of the case. Pounders has been worried that at least one
juror may drop out of the deliberations before all of the charges
are resolved. Since there are no alternates remaining, that would
result in a mistrial on the unresolved matters.
   ``We have an unusual circumstance because we have 65 verdicts to
take,'' he said. ``Taking them one at a time is an insane process.
But waiting for all of them is just as insane because we may lose a
key juror before that time and thus lose all of those verdicts.''

<TEXT>
   A federal jury deliberating
racketeering charges that remain against three people it acquitted
of conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government went home Tuesday
without reaching consensus.
   Attorneys said they didn't know how to interpret the apparent
deadlock.
   ``The only thing I am sure of is they'll be back at 9 a.m.,''
said defense attorney William Newman.
   While clearing Raymond Levasseur, his wife, Patricia Gros
Levasseur, and Richard Williams of seditious conspiracy charges,
jurors indicated Monday that they seriously doubted they could
reach agreement on the racketeering counts in the yearlong trial.
   U.S. District Judge William Young, who Monday urged jurors to
try again, made little comment as he sent the jurors Tuesday to
their 20th day of deliberations. Once they were out of the
courtroom, however, he said he would consider a motion for a
mistrial if the jury remains deadlocked.
   Young said if the government then requests a new trial, it would
be held in Boston and probably would be much shorter.
   Jurors have cleared Mrs. Levasseur of racketeering and were
deciding the same charge against the two men as well as a charge of
racketeering conspiracy against all three. Each count carries a
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and $20,000 in fines.
   Prosecutors suggested that a request jurors made Tuesday to
review defense testimony by corporate executives indicated they
mistakenly believe each act in the indictment has to be proven as
affecting interstate commerce.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks has failed to persuade
the judge to give the jury a clarification about the federal
racketeering law. It requires proving a criminal enterprise as a
whole affects interstate commerce, which could simply mean that it
buys goods in more than one state.
   The government has maintained that the defendants were part of a
group operating under the names United Freedom Front and Sam
Melville-Jonathan Jackson Unit that they said took responsibility
for a string of bombings and bank robberies along the East Coast
from 1976 to 1984.
   Originally, eight people were indicted, but only three are left
in the trial, which was moved from Boston to Springfield.
   Levasseur and Williams already are serving lengthy terms as a
result of separate trials in some of the bombings. Patricia
Levasseur is free on bail after serving 3{ years of a five-year
term for harboring a fugitive, her husband.
   The Springfield prosecution was intended to pull the case
together through racketeering laws that allow several people to be
tried for incidents occurring in several states.
   The racketeering charges include 15 successful or attempted
bombings of courthouses, banks, corporate offices and military
recruiting and reserve centers. One of the bombings, at the Suffolk
County Courthouse in Boston in April 1976, left one man with his
leg severed below the knee, but some of the other devices failed to
explode.
   Of the seven defendants at the time of the initial jury
selection in March 1988, prosecutors dropped charges against two, a
third pleaded guilty to sedition and other charges, and charges
were dropped against a fourth after a judge suppressed evidence
seized at her house.

   The Food and Drug Administration is allowing
wider distribution of a leukemia drug that has been shown effective
in patients who aren't helped by other treatments, an FDA spokesman
said Tuesday.
   The drug, fludarabine phosphate, is being used to treat patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is the most common form of
adult leukemia.
   The drug is believed to slow or interrupt reproduction of
abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow,
blood and liver of people with the disease.
   The FDA has approved wider distribution of the drug under a
``treatment IND,'' which is shorthand for treatment use of an
investigational new drug, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   A treatment IND allows patients with serious or immediately
life-threatening diseases to get an experimental drug while
controlled testing in human clinical trials continues.
   The drug was developed by Triton Biosciences Inc., a Shell Oil
Co. subsidiary based in Alameda, Calif. and clinical trials are
being conducted by National Cancer Institute. Triton plans to
market the drug under the trade name Fludara I.V.

<TEXT>
   Poland will restore full diplomatic
relations with Israel next year, a government spokesman said
Tuesday, and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said later he would
like to visit the Jewish state.
   Mazowiecki said he was invited to Israel by Israeli Vice Premier
Shimon Peres, who is on the second day of a three-day visit to
Poland.
   Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski on Monday informed Peres
of Warsaw's decision to restore relations broken off 22 years ago,
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski.
   ``The resumption of relations can take place in the first
quarter of next year,'' Staniszewski said. After the meeting with
Peres, Mazowiecki said the date for the resumption of relations is
not yet fixed.
   Except for Romania, all Warsaw Pact nations severed diplomatic
relations with Israel following the 1967 Middle East War.
   Hungary on Sept. 18 became the first Warsaw Pact country to
restore relations. Poland has had low-level ties since 1986,
allowing Israel to maintain a diplomatic office in Warsaw, while
the Soviet Union renewed low-level relations last year.
   Mazowiecki expressed Poland's will to resume relations with
Israel in an address to parliament after his election as the East
bloc's first non-communist leader Aug. 24.
   Mazowiecki said Peres had invited him to visit Israel and that
he ``would very much like to be in Israel for many reasons.''
   Relations between the two countries have improved steadily in
recent years with senior Israeli and Polish officials, cultural
figures and private groups exchanging visits. Israel's El Al
Airlines recently established regular service between Warsaw and
Tel Aviv.
   Mazowiecki said his talks with Peres were ``sincere and very
deep. We touched on the history of Polish-Jewish relations our
spiritual roots.''
   Poland had the largest Jewish population in Eastern Europe until
the Holocaust claimed 3 million of Poland's 3.5 million Jews during
World War II, with nearly all the rest emigrating after the war.
   Peres, born in the Polish town of Vishneva, now part of the
Soviet Union, is the highest-ranking Israeli official to visit
Poland since relations were severed.
   He arrived in Warsaw on Monday for a three-day visit aimed at
developing cooperation between Israel and Poland.
   Peres said he planned to discuss agricultural aid, industrial
cooperation and perhaps cooperation in the Third World with Polish
officials. He met President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Leszek
Balcerowicz, the minister of finance, at the start of the visit.
   Polish trade with Israel will amount to $40 million this year,
compared with $22.3 million last year, the official PAP news agency
said.

<TEXT>
   Defense ministers from the seven Warsaw
Pact countries Tuesday opened a three-day meeting to update their
defense policies in light of improved East-West relations,
Hungary's defense minister said.
   At the opening session, Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati said the
ministers would ``put forward and discuss five important and
topical issue that serve the modernization of the joint armed
forces and their defensive doctrine,'' the state MTI news agency
reported.
   In his address to the meeting, also attended by Soviet Gen.
Piotr Lushev, the Warsaw Pact chief commander, Karpati praised the
easing of East-West relations which he attributed to greater
flexibility of the Soviet leadership and the change in Western
attitudes, MTI said.
   ``The new security policy concept and statements of principle of
the socialist countries should be reinforced not only from the
political side of doctrines but also from military-technical
aspects,'' MTI quoted Karpati as saying.
   It was the second meeting of the Soviet bloc's defense chiefs
following a disarmament plan announced in December 1988 by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the unilateral withdrawal of
500,000 troops by the end of 1990.
   This includes the pullout of 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000
tanks from Eastern Europe.
   At an East bloc summit in Romania last summer, the Soviet Union
and its allies signed an agreement to seek a nuclear-free Europe
with significantly fewer soldiers and arms.
   Gorbachev said then that the accord contained the Warsaw Pact's
answer to President Bush's May 29 proposal for reductions in
conventional forces. Bush called for cuts in U.S. and Soviet troops
in Europe outside the Soviet Union to 275,000 soldiers each, and
for reductions in weapons and combat aircraft.
   Karpati said an agreement at the East-West talks on conventional
disarmament in Vienna ``requires profound changes in the doctrines
of both NATO and the Warsaw Treaty,'' MTI reported.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer on Tuesday rejected
the recommendation of the Louisiana Pardon Board and refused to
halt the execution of a man convicted of killing two men before he
was 18.
   Dalton Prejean, now 30, is to die early Thursday for the 1977
murder of state Trooper Donald Cleveland.
   Roemer acted shortly after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal
threw out the latest of Prejean's numerous appeals, rejecting,
among other things, claims that he is retarded and a victim of
racial discrimination.
   Andrea Robinson, one of Prejean's attorneys, said she would go
to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has twice refused to hear his
appeals.
   The Pardon Board voted 3-2 Monday to recommend reducing the
death sentence to life in prison for Prejean, who killed Cleveland
six months after being released from a juvenile institution where
he was sent at age 14 for the murder of a taxi driver.
   The majority of the board voted for clemency based on testimony
that Prejean had been abused as a child, that he probably suffered
some brain damage as a child, that he had a good prison record and
showed remorse, board Chairwoman Yvonne Foreman said.
   Roemer said he talked with defense attorneys and witnesses and
studied the decision of the pardon board.
   ``With a handgun he shot three times a state trooper in the
chest and face and killed him,'' Roemer said at a news conference.
``It was not his first murder.''
   Roemer noted the background of abuse as a child and reduced
intelligence, but added that ``standards of age, of intelligence,
meet those standards set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``And finally, I would say there is a special circumstance in my
position, to have a state trooper in the line of duty in uniform to
be brutally and maliciously murdered.''
   Prejean and his brother had been drinking, left a bar in their
car and were stopped by Cleveland. Prejean said the trooper
manhandled his brother and that he feared for his brother's life.
   In appeals, defense lawyers pointed to evidence that Prejean had
an I.Q. of 76 and that, according to a psychiatrist, he performed
on tests ``at a level of borderline retardation.''
   But the three-judge 5th Circuit panel said that neither
Prejean's limited mental ability nor his age at the time of the
crime constituted reasons to reverse the death sentence.
   ``Prejean is not `mentally retarded' as that term is defined by
the American Association on Mental Retardation as one with an I.Q.
of 70 or below,'' wrote Chief Judge Charles Clark.
   The 5th Circuit also rejected arguments that the execution
should be stopped because Prejean, who is black, had an all-white
jury, saying lawyers failed to prove blacks were eliminated from
the jury in a discriminatory manner.
   Prejean was sent to prison in March 1980 and has been on death
row longer than any of the other 35 condemned men. He has had eight
stays of execution in the last 10 years.

   A fire that destroyed the campus laundry
has forced some University of Notre Dame students to get a quick
education in suds. And for some of them, thanks to a ``great mom,''
it's their first-ever brush with the subject.
   In the past, male undergraduates were charged an annual fee and
received an allotment of laundry services. There are no laundry
facilities in men's halls.
   Now, the students are having to use public laundry machines on
campus.
   ``I never thought I'd have to wash my own clothes. I had no
curiosity at all about it,'' said Joe Theby, a freshman, who said
his mother and two sisters handled the laundry at home.
   ``It's not too bad,'' said freshman Paul Pearson. ``I started on
the whites, because if something screws up they are easy to
replace.''
   ``It's not as difficult as I thought it was going to be, but
Mom's still going to send me some clean clothes in a care
package,'' said Pearson.
   ``I'm just worried that I could destroy something,'' said junior
Dave Brown, who had done his own laundry only a couple of times
before. ``At home, Mom did the laundry. I have a great mom.''
   Pre-measured detergent packages helped some, like freshman Greg
Murphy.
   ``I just put it all in,'' Murphy said. ``I hope it's not too
much. I guess I won't know for a while. I don't know what I'd do
without it.''
   Brown advised a different solution: ``Try to find a girlfriend
maybe.''

<HEAD>Pope's Assailant Says He Could Lead Islamic World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mehmet Ali Agca, who tried to kill Pope
John Paul II in 1981, now says he could lead the Moslem world if he
decided to take up politics, the Istanbul newspaper Sabah reported.
   ``The quality and belief of a Moslem is in his heart. ... You
have to know that if I get into politics one day I can become the
leader of the Islamic World, because I am a true Moslem,'' it
quoted the Turkish gunman as saying in an interview, published in
installments Sunday through Tuesday.
   Agca shot and wounded John Paul on May 18, 1981, in St. Peter's
Square and is serving a life term in a prison at Ascoli Piceno, 85
miles northeast of Rome, where he was interviewed.
   He first said he had acted alone, but later claimed Bulgarian
agents had planned the attack with Soviet help. In 1986, three
Turks and three Bulgarians were acquitted of involvement.
   A life sentence really means 30 years in Italy and Agca could be
paroled in the year 2001. Agca said he wanted to live in a country
that would accept him after his parole, and ``if Italy allows me to
stay I want to stay here. ''
   ``In fact I want to return to Turkey, but this is impossible,''
Sabah quoted him as saying.
   A Turkish court condemned Agca to death, in absentia, for
killing Abdi Ipekci, editor of the daily Milliyet, in 1979. He was
arrested in June 1979 and confessed, but escaped from prison before
the year was out.

   Those who fancy this seaside
community as an artist colony replaced banners depicting holly,
carolers and sleigh bells with slick holiday fare of dolphins, kelp
and gulls.
   The first of 225 banners were fastened to lampposts near the
entrance to the Santa Monica Pier on Tuesday morning.
   ``They wouldn't make much sense in Toronto or Cincinnati or Des
Moines, but they make a lot of sense here at the city by the bay,''
said artist Laddie John Dill during unveiling of the arty lamp pole
decorations.
   Word spread this week that the new banners were going up and
telephones began ringing incessantly at Santa Monica Area Chamber
of Commerce offices.
   The marine theme was too much of a departure from the religious
significance of the season, residents complained. The Chamber of
Commerce was taking Christ out of Christmas and the Santa out of
Santa Monica.
   ``Most of the calls involved concern we had done away with the
traditional Christmas decorations,'' said chamber president Duane
Nightengale. The chamber sponsored the $15,000 replacement project.
   ``The traditional decorations are going to be up as well,'' said
the chamber's Dave Paradis.
   It is true the carolers, holly and bells on the old banners are
gone, Nightengale said, but the Nativity scene still adorns
Palisades Park and garland has been strung up at Fourth Street and
Wilshire Boulevard.
   Michael Segal, who headed the design project as a member of the
chamber's central business district advisory group, said the
``strong marine motif'' captured the city's uniqueness.
   ``The kelp gives a mistletoe feeling, the dolphins are in a
wreath design and the gull looks like a Christmas dove of peace,''
Segal said.
   Adding to the holiday ambiance of gulls, kelp and sea mammals
were the words ``Peace,'' ``Friendship'' and ``Joy.''
   Dill designed the 3-foot-by-7-foot banners with graphic artist
John Van Hamersveld. ``They look like greeting cards, don't they?''
asked Hamersveld.
   ``I wanted something that was more tailored to Santa Monica ...
which has become the arts center of California,'' added Dill.
   Soviet emigre Suzy Hartwick, squinting on a sunny day at the
edge of the continent, smiled and said, ``They are very nice. I
love Christmas. It reminds me of home when I had a home.''

   The Transportation Department issued
drug-testing rules Tuesday it said are aimed at ensuring accurate
testing and protecting the privacy of employees in transportation
industries.
   Federally mandated drug-testing, including random testing,
begins in the aviation, railroad, marine, trucking, mass transit
and pipeline industries next month. Employees in safety-related
jobs will have to submit to the tests under programs their
employers must set up.
   The department's drug-testing program is to take effect in
December despite several pending court challenges.
   The final rules require employers to use certified laboratories
and to send three ``blind samples'' for each 100 actual samples to
be tested. Blind samples are urine specimens that have been spiked
with drugs to test the laboratory's accuracy.
   The rules also call for both initial screening and a
confirmation test to ensure against false positive results, as well
as a determination by a physician that there is no legitimate
medical explanation for a positive test result.
   Employers also may split an employee's sample, so that a second
test may be run if the first is questioned.
   The department said it rejected suggestions for an expansion of
the number of drugs for which tests are run.

<HEAD>French National Front Scores Big on Anti-Immigrant Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communists and Socialists are urging voters to
back conservative candidates for Parliament in a painful and
desperate bid to block the extreme right National Front in two
special elections next Sunday.
   Neither leftist party could bring itself to utter the specific
words, but the message was clear _ everything must be done in the
second round to keep the National Front from winning seats in the
National Assembly. And the only alternative is to vote for the
traditional right.
   The National Front's popularity has been buoyed by controversy
over Moslem immigrants from North Africa and the right of
schoolgirls to wear traditional Islamic headscarves to class. The
National Front scored big in the first round of special elections
in Marseille and Dreux on Sunday.
   In both elections, the Socialists came in a dismal third.
   Next Sunday's runoffs will be a battle of the right with the
National Front candidate in Dreux facing an opponent from the
neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic, and in Marseille a
center-right candidate of the Union for French Democracy.
   The National Front long has campaigned on an anti-immigration
and ``France for the French'' platform and consistently has won 9
to 14.5 percent of the vote in recent elections.
   ``The voters are beginning to understand that our ideas are good
sense,'' said Marie-France Stirbois, who led all candidates in the
race for the seat from Dreux with 42.5 percent of the vote.
   In Marseille, Marie-Claude Roussel won 33 percent of the vote to
finish second and get into the runoff.
   Said National Front President Jean-Marie Le Pen: ``It is not
against the National Front, but with it that the future must be
envisaged if you want to get rid of socialism in this country.''
   The Communist Party Politburo asked communist voters ``to do
everything to defeat, by their vote in the second round, the
candidates of the National Front.''
   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard called on voters to ``defeat the
National Front. The National Front brings only violence, never a
solution.''
   The French always seem surprised at each good performance by the
extreme right party. French pollster Jerome Jaffre says that is
because many people are ashamed to admit they harbor extreme right
sentiments, yet they vote that way.
   For seven weeks, a controversy has raged over the right of
schoolgirls to wear the hijab, or Islamic scarf, to school. The law
in this mostly Roman Catholic country calls for strict secularity
in schools.
   The Council of State, France's highest administrative authority,
issued an ambiguous opinion Monday saying girls could wear the
hijab to school if it was not disruptive. It left it to school
authorities to decide in individual cases.
   The original problem arose because local school authorities made
just such a decision and prohibited the girls from attending class.
   Le Pen said the demand for mosques, with a huge one recently
approved in Lyon, and the wearing of the hijab ``are anti-national
actions that threaten our security, our identity, our integrity.''
   A recent poll indicated that 67 percent of the French think
borders should be closed to further immigrants.
   Eighty-three percent oppose wearing the hijab in school.
   The anti-immigrant antagonism seems directed specifically at
Moslems.
   Immigrants make up nearly 7 percent of France's 55 million
people. The National Front claims immigrants take social benefits
at the expense of French-born citizens.

<HEAD>Parts Of The South Get A Soaking, Temperatures Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell across the South on Tuesday along the leading edge of
cold air washing in from the Arctic, and parts of southern
California were buffetted by high wind.
   A cold front ushered cold dry air into the northeastern part of
the nation and showers and thunderstorms developed along that
curving front from northern Georgia across the central Gulf Coast
region.
   Enough rain fell at New Orleans during the morning to push the
city's rainfall total for the month to nearly 20 inches. That not
only exceeds the previous November record of 14.58 inches, set in
1947, but also surpasses the previous record for any month of the
year _ 19.09 inches in March 1948.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 0.92 of an inch of rain
fell at Mobile, Ala., and 1.44 inches fell at New Orleans.
   The northwesterly wind produced snow squalls in the Great Lakes
region, with 6 to 8 inches possible in snowbelt areas of Michigan.
Heavy snow blanketed parts of northern Michigan late Monday with 7
inches reported at Marquette and Gwinn.
   Also late Monday, thunderstorms that developed along and ahead
of the cold front produced damaging wind in Michigan, indiana and
Ohio.
   Strong, gusty Santa Ana wind blew across parts of southern
California. Wind gusted to 51 mph at Sandberg, Calif., and a truck
on the Cajon Pass was reportedly blown over by wind, the National
Weather Service said.
   Snow that fell over northern New England during the night
diminished during the morning or changed to light rain and drizzle.
   Warm weather continued ahead of the cold front in parts of the
East. Temperatures warmed into the 70s across the Southeast, and in
the 80s over the Florida Peninsula, and the middle Atlantic states
reached the 60s.
   But behind the front, strong northwesterly wind brought cold
arctic air and afternoon temperatures were generally still below
freezing from eastern Montana through the middle and upper
Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes, and only in the single
digits across Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, northeastern South
Dakota and northwestern Wisconsin.
   From Monday night into Tuesday morning, readings below zero were
reported in parts of Nevada, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South
Dakota and Minnesota.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 below zero at
Gunnison, Colo., and Warroad, Minn.

<HEAD>PLO Officials Say Terrorist Abu Nidal Under Medical Supervision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Palestinian master terrorist Abu Nidal is
under medical supervision at his home in Libya after recurrence of
a heart ailment, but his life is in no immediate danger, two senior
PLO officials said Tuesday.
   The officials, interviewed separately by telephone from
Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia's
capital, called ``inaccurate'' reports from Algeria that Abu Nidal
was dying of cancer.
   They also denied reports he was under house arrest.
   Abu Nidal, 52, tops U.S., European and Asian most wanted lists.
His henchmen stand accused of killing nearly 1,000 people, most of
them civilians, in attacks around the world.
   An Algerian medical source who recently returned home from Libya
said Abu Nidal _ real name Sabri al-Banna _ ``is in a military
hospital in Libya suffering from a cancerous metastase that is
probably terminal.''
   A metastase is cancerous tissue that spreads the disease
throughout the body.
   ``It's not cancer. It's his heart,'' said one of the PLO
officials, who insisted on anonymity. ``He has been bedridden for
two weeks.''
   The PLO sources said their information was based on reports from
``reliable'' Libyan security officials.
   The other official said Abu Nidal complained of chest pains for
weeks, and Libyan physicians initially attributed it to ``mere
exhaustion.''
   But he said the terrorist began complaining of breathing
difficulties, ``prompting doctors to confine him to bed after he
refused to be taken to a hospital.''
   Dissidents reported this month that Abu Nidal had become
``increasingly paranoid'' after a bloody split in the ranks of his
Fatah-Revolutionary Council in which at least 200 activists died.
   They said he never leaves his home in a fenced training base on
the outskirts of Tripoli. He has lived in Libya since Syria
expelled him in 1987.
   The New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions that Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, under pressure to rein in the terror
network that damaged the Palestinian crusade for statehood, had put
Abu Nidal under house arrest.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said in
Washington Tuesday, ``We don't know'' if Abu Nidal was under house
arrest.
   ``One report today has that he has cancer and is in a
hospital,'' she said. ``We don't know. One report has that he's
arrested. We just ... don't know.''
   The PLO officials said Abu Nidal underwent open-heart surgery in
Bulgaria in 1984.
   ``But doctors reported only 70 percent success after the double
bypass operation. ... He has had one or two mild heart problems,
but nothing too serious,'' one source said.
   He said the latest setback ``may be more complicated because of
the physical, mental and psychological stress he's been under'' _ a
reference to the split in Abu Nidal's organization.
   Abu Nidal gained popularity among the frustrated youth of
Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon after the 1982 Israeli
invasion.
   His group grew that year from 300 to about 1,000 young men
pledged to an armed struggle against Israel.
   But later, many followers began questioning the link between
terrorist attacks they were ordered to undertake and the liberation
of their homeland.
   Complaints increased after a puzzling alliance that Abu Nidal
struck in 1985 with Hezbollah, or the Party of God. Abu Nidal
preaches Maoism. Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian fundamentalist Moslem
group in Lebanon.
   Abu Nidal was born in Jaffa in 1937, the 14th child of a
prominent landowner, and taught school in Jerusalem. He joined
Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction, after leaving for Saudi Arabia
following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   He is married and has at least two children, a son and a
daughter. A short, stocky, balding man, the elusive Abu Nidal
seldom appears in public or gives interviews.
   He reportedly played a leading role in the massacre of Israeli
athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany.
   Abu Nidal, whose war name means ``father of the struggle'' in
Arabic, split from Fatah in early 1973 with another officer, Ahmed
Abdul-Ghaffour.
   That August they killed five people and wounded 55 in a grenade
and pistol attack at Athens airport. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
publicly said then that the two must be sought and executed.
   Ghaffour was killed a month later. Abu Nidal pledged to kill
Arafat, blaming him for Ghaffour's death.
   Abu Nidal gunmen proceeded to kill at least 16 top aides of
Arafat in Europe and the Middle East.
   Notorious attacks by Abu Nidal's terrorists included the
November 1985 hijacking of an Egyptian airliner to Malta in which
59 people died; twin raids on Rome and Vienna airports that killed
20 people on Dec. 27, 1985; and a Pan Am jet hijacking in Karachi,
Pakistan, in September 1986 that killed 21 people.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon should consider moving military
units out of bases in highly populated areas to make room for
increased civilian aviation, a general aviation industry official
proposed Tuesday.
   ``Some would say that this is a radical and unrealistic
suggestion,'' said Max E. Bleck, chairman of Beech Aircraft Corp.
``But, until a few weeks ago, anyone who suggested that East
Germany would punch holes in the Berlin Wall would have been called
radical and unrealistic,'' said Bleck.
   Bleck said units at bases in highly populated and congested
areas could be moved to bases the Defense Department is closing in
less populous areas.
   Both Bleck, who also is chairman of the General Aviation
Manufacturers Association, and Edward W. Stimpson, the
organization's president, called for increased civilian use of
military airports. They addressed an aviation industry meeting.
   Transportation officials estimate that the demand for commercial
aviation will double in the next 10 years, while it will take
longer than that for any new airports to be approved and built.
   Bleck said President Bush and the secretaries of Defense and
Transportation should draw up a plane for the civilian use of
nonstrategic military airfields around the country.
   Stimpson said the new spirit of cooperation between the United
States and the Soviet Union and potential defense cutbacks could
lead to unemployment in defense industries. But he said a
resurgence of general aviation could supply thousands of jobs to
trained workers.

<HEAD>Governor's Committee Takes Aim At Sexual Predators</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   SEA-TAC, Wash. (AP) _ Sex offenders would get sentences of up to
life in prison and be required to register with the police under
recommendations of a state task force formed after two shocking sex
crimes.
   Gov. Booth Gardner endorsed the recommendations
``unequivocally'' on Tuesday, and the measures are expected to sail
through the Legislature after it convenes on Jan. 8.
   The panel's recommendations came after months of public hearings
in which residents recounted family tragedies at the hands of
sexual predators. The families also complained about a corrections
system they contended could not protect them from habitual
criminals.
   The panel was spurred by the sexual mutilation of a Tacoma boy
in May and the rape and murder of a Seattle businesswoman nine
months earlier.
   During the committee's work, three boys in Vancouver and
Portland, Ore., were slain, allegedly by a sex offender, and an
18-year-old female jogger was slain near Acme.
   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng, who heads the 24-member
committee, referred to the Vancouver and Acme slayings as he sat
next to Gardner at the task force's final meeting.
   The murder of Amanda Stavik occurred ``about a quarter-mile from
my boyhood home. That hit home for me personally,'' Maleng said.
   Police are still seeking leads in the case. An autopsy report
released Tuesday was inconclusive but said the circumstances of her
death were consistent with drowning. Police consider the case a
homicide.
   In the Vancouver case, Westley Allan Dodd pleaded innocent to
three counts of first-degree murder Tuesday and was held without
bail.
   Gardner called the panel's recommendations a broad and
comprehensive approach to getting predatory sex criminals off
Washington streets.
   ``Step two is to take this and put it into legislation,'' he
said.
   Key lawmakers, including Senate Law and Justice Committee head
Gary Nelson, said it will be a top priority from the first day of
the session.
   The committee included victims and relatives of sex criminals.
One of them, Ida Balliasiotes, said she thought the package was ``a
good first start but may be some of the sentencing provisions could
have been tougher.''
   Her daughter, Diane Balliasiotes, was raped and slain after
being kidnapped from in September 1988. Gene Raymond Kane is
serving a life sentence for her murder.
   Another panel member, Lucy Berliner, of the Sexual Assault
Center at Harborview Hospital in Seattle, acknowledged that the
package would not have stopped the state's most notorious sex
killer, Ted Bundy, who was executed in Florida earlier this year
after a string of slayings in the West and in Florida.
   The recommendations, which are expected to cost $15 million in
the coming year and about $55 million in subsequent years, would:
   _Empower judges to sentence repeat rapists and child molesters
to life in prison. These crimes now carry a 10-year maximum
sentence.
   _Permit prosecution as adults of 15-year-olds who commit sex
crimes of a heinous nature and 16-year-olds who commit lesser sex
offenses.
   _Require convicted sex offenders to register with the Washington
State Patrol and the sheriff. Failure to register would be
punishable by up to five years in prison.
   _Improve treatment of sex offenders, including closely monitored
post-release treatment.
   _Empower juries to indefinitely commit for treatment any sex
offender found incompetent to stand trial. Maleng and Gardner
acknowledged possible civil rights concerns with the provision, but
said it would be used with discretion.
   _Create a $2.5 million-a-year fund to cover medical and other
expenses of sex crime victims.

   Tiny 21-month-old Alyssa Smith, who received the
nation's first living-donor liver transplant appeared ``back on a
smooth course'' Tuesday after internal bleeding prompted a return
to surgery, her doctor said.
   Alyssa was in critical but stable condition after the second,
pre-dawn surgery early Tuesday to stop bleeding detected within 12
hours of the Monday transplant, said Dr. Christoph Broelsch, who
headed the surgical team.
   Alyssa's father, John L. Smith of San Antonio, said the rushed
return to the operating room caused some tense moments for him and
his wife, Teresa, the liver donor, but that he was reassured when
he saw his daughter.
   ``I think she looked great, even with the surgery and
everything, she looked great,'' he said, his voice trembling. ``Her
eyes were kind of open and she saw me and ... her face kind of lit
up a bit.''
   Smith said his wife ``wants to go see Alyssa. Of course she
knows she can't do it right away. Every time I go in to see her,
that's all she wants to know. She wants to hear she's fine from
me.''
   Alyssa was awake, active and moving around after the second
procedure, although still on sedation and a ventilator, Broelsch
said.
   ``The transplant is definitely functioning and for now things
are back on a smooth course,'' he said at a midmorning news
conference at the University of Chicago Medical Center.
   The bleeding on the surface of Alyssa's new liver, which is
about the size of a man's fist, was a complication that occurs in
about 30 percent of all liver transplants, said Dr. Peter
Whitington, director of pediatric transplant services for the
hospital.
   Doctors corrected the problem in a few minutes, but kept her in
surgery for nearly five hours of observation, Broelsch said.
   Doctors said Alyssa may undergo another exploratory operation
within a few days to examine the new liver.
   Mrs. Smith, who became the nation's first living
liver-transplant donor Monday when doctors removed the left lobe of
her liver for Alyssa's transplant, was in fair condition Tuesday,
they said. She was moved from intensive care to a private room, and
could be discharged in a week.
   In three to five days, doctors will know if Alyssa is healing
properly, and in a week they should know whether the body is
rejecting the organ.
   The transplanted liver already is working, producing bile and
performing other functions, doctors said.
   Alyssa suffers from an often-fatal liver disorder called biliary
atresia, the leading cause for liver transplants involving
children. She had been waiting more than a year for a cadaver
transplant when her parents asked to participate in the hospital's
living-donor program.
   Smith said he felt helpless while his wife and daughter
underwent surgery.
   During Monday's 14-hour transplant operation, the assistant
shipping supervisor said he played with the couple's 3-year-old
son, Ricky, paced the hallway and kept in constant contact with
hospital administrators.
   Monday's procedure was complicated when Mrs. Smith's spleen was
damaged and had to be removed, but doctors predicted she would
recover fully.
   The hospital has authorized 20 living-donor transplants to
determine whether the procedure is worth the risks. The German-born
Broelsch developed the technique for using segments of donor livers
in 1984 while at the University of Hannover.
   A second transplant, involving a Tennessee girl, could come as
early as next Wednesday, Whitington sai.
   The hospital has been deluged with calls from parents interested
in the procedure, he said, but doctors will insist on physician
referral.
   ``I think that this procedure is not for everybody,'' Whitington
said.
   ``It's for those parents who feel that there is a need to
provide a piece of their liver for their child,'' he said. ``It is
clear that we can take care of patients other ways, other than
through living-organ donations.''
   The options include whole and partial liver transplants from
cadavers.
   But Alyssa's surgery is being closely watched because
living-donor transplants could provide a solution to the shortage
of organs for young children who need transplants, Whitington said.
   In the United States, more than 700 babies each year need liver
transplants, and as many as half die for lack of a donor.
   Liver transplants from living donors have been performed only

   A man who admitted killing a drug dealer
during a botched robbery was given a reduced sentence after the
judge read a letter in which the victim's young children said they
forgave the gunman.
   Shane Garner, who pleaded guilty to unintentional second-degree
murder for shooting Duane Fyten in the head May 26 in St. Paul, was
sentenced Monday to 7{ years.
   The sentence imposed by Ramsey County District Judge J. Thomas
Mott is a year less than the minimum recommended by state
guidelines. He said Garner deserved some leniency because he had
assisted prosecutors' cases against three co-defendants, because he
clearly had not intended to kill Fyten and because he had shown
remorse.
   Garner choked back sobs when the judge read the letter from
7-year-old Jessica and 6-year-old Jason Fyten.
   ``We wish you wouldn't have shot our dad; it made us very sad
and mad,'' the letter said. ``We miss our Dad a lot! Sometimes the
pain is so bad we can hardly stand it, and we cry a lot. You had no
right to shoot our Dad; it was very wrong. We are only 6 and 7
years old but at least we know that he loved us.
   ``We hope that you can stop doing drugs and selling drugs
because you still have that chance. We also hope that you have
learned that crime doesn't pay.
   ``The only thing we are happy about is that our Dad doesn't have
to suffer with drugs anymore.
   ``We want you to know that we did forgive you for what you did
the very day it happened. ... Please remember we don't hate you; so
don't let this ruin the rest of your life.''
   Fyten, 30, was shot in a brief struggle at the door of his
apartment. Garner admitted firing the fatal shot, but said he
thought he had emptied the gun earlier by firing a round and then
removing the clip. However, the pistol had already automatically
reloaded, the judge said.
   Robert Williamson II, 20, of Gem Lake, also pleaded guilty to
second-degree murder and was sentenced to 68 months in prison.
Blaine Christofferson, 21, of St. Paul, was sentenced to two years
for attempted aggravated robbery. Frank DeRosa, 22, of St. Paul,
the robbers' getaway driver, was sentenced to one year in jail and
10 years on probation for simple robbery.
   All four also were ordered to share in paying more than $16,000
in restitution to Fyten's family for his funeral and burial
expenses.

<HEAD>Youth Gets 34 Years in Killing of Girlfriend's Mother</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young man described as the sexual slave
of his former girlfriend was sentenced to 34 years in prison
Tuesday for killing the girl's mother.
   Superior Court Judge Raymond R. Norko expressed compassion and
outrage before imposing the sentence, telling Dennis Coleman, 21,
that ``whatever I do to you, I'm basically throwing away your
youth.''
   ``Your youth will be spent at Somers (State Prison),'' Norko
said, his eyes filling with tears. ``I find Somers probably the
most dangerous place I know of on earth. Part of me goes with you.''
   But, Norko said, testimony from Coleman and his friends about
the Aug. 5, 1987, killing of Joyce Aparo ``sent a chill up my
spine.''
   ``You and they come from a very middle class community ... yet
your peers spoke of murder as if it was a candy bar on a shelf that
could be reached by anybody.''
   Coleman showed no emotion as Norko passed the sentence.
Coleman's mother, who sobbed quietly through the sentencing
hearing, buried her face in her hands as her son was led away.
   Coleman pleaded guilty to murder and conspiracy to commit murder
in the stangulation of Joyce Aparo in her apartment. Under a plea
bargain, he had faced 30 to 42 years in prison.
   Coleman claimed that Joyce Aparo's daughter, Karin Aparo, now
18, begged him to kill her abusive mother.
   Assistant State's Attorney James E. Thomas argued for the full
42-year sentence, reminding Norko that Coleman struggled with Joyce
Aparo for 10 minutes before killing her.
   ``This isn't something that took place in a split second,'' he
said. ``This is a brutal, cold-blooded murder that took a long
time.''
   Calm and composed, Coleman addressed the court before being
sentence.
   ``If I could turn back time, I would,'' he said. ``Mr. Thomas
says it was a cold-blooded crime. I'm not a cold-blooded murderer.
It was the opposite of cold-blooded. It was passion.''
   Prosecutors contend Coleman and Karin Aparo plotted Joyce
Aparo's killing for more than a year. Karin Aparo is awaiting trial
in her mother's death after a Superior Court judge rejected her
request for special probation earlier this month. Coleman is
expected to testify against her.
   Coleman's lawyer, M. Hatcher Norris, said Coleman will likely
spend about 20 years in prison.
   A tall, slender redhead, Coleman appeared composed as he waited
outside the courtroom with family, friends and his new girlfriend
before the sentencing.
   He said he hasn't seen Karin Aparo since several weeks after
Joyce Aparo's slaying. Asked what he thought should happen to Karin
Aparo, Coleman said: ``I don't care. She'll be going to prison one
way or another, I guess. She deserves it.''
   Norris on Tuesday portrayed Aparo as manipulative, calculating
and amoral _ ``what I can only describe as a girl without a heart.''
   On the first day of a two-day sentencing hearing last week, Dr.
Gerald A. Faris, a Glastonbury psychologist who has treated Coleman
for two years, testified that Coleman was pressured into the murder
by his domineering girlfriend.
   ``Enslavement, I guess you could call it,'' Faris said.
   Before Coleman met Aparo, he had been suffering from a
personality disorder that filled him with a deep emptiness, leaving
him vulnerable to obsessive love and even to being seduced into
committing criminal acts, Faris testified.
   At age 15, Aparo sent Coleman descriptive letters and pictures
of sexual acts they would perform together, witnesses testified. By
age 16, she had recorded in her diary about 100 times they had sex,
witnesses testified.

   The body of an 8-year-old whose landmark
legal battle opened schools to mentally disabled AIDS victims was
flown Tuesday to Maryland for an autopsy her mother hopes will aid
research into the incurable disease.
   Eliana Martinez, whose weight had dropped to about 15 pounds,
died of heart failure Monday, cradled in the arms of her adoptive
mother.
   ``She opened her eyes and there were tears in them. She looked
at me to help. I could not,'' Rosa Martinez said Tuesday. ``It was
not a peaceful angel-like death. It was agonizing.''
   Mrs. Martinez won a court battle to let Eliana go to school
without being sealed in a glass box to ensure that she would not
infect her classmates.
   Funeral services were planned for early next week in Tampa. The
date will depend on how much time doctors need at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., said Mrs. Martinez.
   ``She died like she lived _ fighting every inch of the way,''
Mrs. Martinez said.
   ``Her body couldn't take it anymore,'' said Dan McClowry,
Eliana's speech therapist and a close friend of Mrs. Martinez.
   Over the last few days, Eliana had slipped in and out of coma.
   ``Seeing the joy she won't have makes you realize it's not a
house or money that's important,'' Mrs. Martinez said. ``Whatever
you're doing you should enjoy it. Life is so short.''
   Mrs. Martinez, a licensed practical nurse, answered a radio plea
about an abandoned baby and adopted Eliana as a sickly 11-month-old
from a hospital in Puerto Rico.
   She then led the precedent-setting struggle to get Eliana into
public school with children her own age. She said Eliana needed to
be with children her own age.
   Eliana's two-year federal court fight against the Hillsborough
County School system drew national attention.
   Fearing Eliana posed a risk of transmitting AIDS to classmates
and teachers, education officials put the child on homebound
education.
   They feared Eliana might transmit bodily fluids because she was
not toilet trained and sucked her fingers, but Mrs. Martinez sued.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich ruled in August 1988
that Eliana could attend a special-needs school only if she sat
inside a specially built, $10,000 glass booth.
   Mrs. Martinez appealed, and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta ordered a rehearing last December. Kovachevich
reversed her decision last spring, saying the health risk was
remote and theoretical.
   Eliana went to school and sat at desks with classmates in April
at Manhattan Exceptional Center, but after only a few weeks she
became too ill for school.
   ``She fought for her life all her life,'' said teacher Peggy
Kelly.
   Doctors believe she contracted the AIDS virus from tainted blood
transfusions as an infant. She was diagnosed with AIDS-related
complex, a precursor to AIDS, in 1985.
   Eliana had been treated with the experimental drugs AZT, then
DDI, but was taken off both when they failed to control the
disease. Her condition steadily worsened in the last two months and
she was hospitalized at least twice with bacterial infections.

<TEXT>
   Syria rushed troops and armor into
Lebanon, apparently building up for an imminent assault on the
headquarters of Gen. Michel Aoun after Lebanon's new government on
Tuesday fired the stubborn Christian army commander.
   ``I shall fight unto death,'' Aoun vowed to thousands of youths
who formed a human shield around the shell-battered, hilltop
presidential palace where he was barricaded, five miles east of
Beirut.
   He said the Syrians ``will bear the guilt of a horrific
massacre.''
   Aoun does not recognize newly elected President Elias Hrawi, a
Maronite Catholic like himself, and pledges to keep up his efforts
to drive Syrian troops from Lebanon. Syria supports Hrawi.
   Barbed wire covered the palace roof to guard against a paratroop
raid and armor-piercing mines were planted in surrounding
pinewoods, Aoun's aides said.
   France, the Christians' traditional protector and the colonial
power here until independence in 1973, stepped in to avert a new
round of bloodletting in a civil war that has killed more than
150,000 people since 1975.
   French envoy Francois Scheer met with Hrawi in Chtoura, east
Lebanon, and then drove to Damascus for talks with Syrian
government officials.
   The Foreign Ministry in Paris declared in a statement that
France ``will not be on the side of those who would assume the
responsibility of again taking up violence.''
   In a telephone interview on France Inter radio station following
his dismissal, Aoun rejected ``as non-existent all acts coming from
a puppet power.''
   Residents in Chtoura, a market town on the main Beirut-Damascus
highway, said the rumble of tanks, armored personnel carriers and
military trucks jolted them awake during the night.
   The residents, insisting on anonymity for security
considerations, said about 15,000 to 16,000 troops in 800 trucks
poured in Tuesday from Syria.
   They counted 120 artillery pieces, 90 Soviet-designed T-62
tanks, 40 multibarreled rocket launchers, two mine-clearing tanks,
and fuel trucks headied west toward the central mountains and
Beirut after crossing into Lebanon.
   Other military sources said the reinforcements deployed along
mountain ridges above the Baabda presidential palace and on the
Green Line, which divides Beirut into Christian and Moslem sectors.
   Syria, the main powerbroker here, has stationed 40,000 troops on
70 percent of Lebanon's territory under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Syria supports Hrawi and a Cabinet of national reconciliation
under Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, which is seeking
to implement a peace plan to end 14 years of civil war.
   Hrawi dismissed Aoun a head of an interim military Cabinet on
Sunday and gave him 48 hours to leave the Baabda palace,
traditional seat of Lebanese presidents, or face a lightning
assault.
   Aoun commanded some 20,000 mainly Christian units during a
six-month battle against the Syrians that was halted Sept. 22 by
the Arab League-brokered cease-fire.
   Before the peace plan was adopted, Aoun and Hoss had led
competing Christian and Moslem governments for 14 months.
   Aoun, 54, rejects the peace accord, approved by Parliament last
month, and said Hrawi's election Friday was unconstitutional
because Parliament chose him in the shadow of ``Syrian
occupation.'' He demands Syrian withdrawal as a condition for any
settlement.
   Adm. Emile Lahoud, a 53-year-old Maronite, was appointed to
replace Aoun as chief of the 42,000-member armed forces, which
split on sectarian lines after the government did so in September
1988.
   Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib commands the 22,000 Moslem soldiers, who
are poorly equipped and stayed out of the battle.
   The government is trying to reunite the armed forces under
Lahoud, head of the small Lebanese navy, as part of Hrawi's effort
to form a strong central government that can end the civil war.
   Defense Minister Albert Mansour said in Chtoura that soldiers
who stuck with Aoun would be dismissed, but ``whoever declares
loyalty to the legitimate auhorities remains a member of the army.''
   Michel Hayek, a university student who stood outside the
presidential palace, said of Aoun: ``The general is the symbol of
our independence. If the Syrians want to kill him, they'll have to
kill us first.''
   A jet fighter streaked over Baabda at high altitude. Both
Christian and Moslem anti-aircraft gunners fired before it vanished
over the Mediterranean.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command said it was a Syrian MiG-23, but
police said it could not be identified.

   President Bush has chosen former New York
State Sen. John R. Dunne as assistant attorney general for civil
rights, the post left vacant all year after William Lucas failed to
win Senate confirmation, administration sources said Tuesday.
   Dunne belongs to the all-male Garden City Golf Club on Long
Island and has said he would resign that membership if nominated to
the Justice Department post.
   Dunne, 59, of Garden City, is credited with helping reform the
state's prison system following the deadly riot at Attica Prison in
1971.
   Meanwhile, Bush signed legislation Tuesday extending the life of
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights through Sept. 30, 1991. The
panel, shrouded in controversy during the Reagan years, had been
faced with extinction.
   The sources, who insisted on anonymity, said Bush has settled on
Dunne for the civil rights job and Dunne is undergoing a background
clearance check before the White House formally announces the
nomination.
   That check could take up to two months.
   Dunne, a graduate of Georgetown University and Yale Law School,
resigned from the New York Senate in September after losing a
contest for majority leader in the Republican-controlled chamber.
   After a 24-year legislative career in which chaired the
Judiciary Committee and rose to deputy majority leader, Dunne
returned to practice law full time in Uniondale.
   A secretary who answered the telephone at Dunne's office said
only, ``The senator has no comments and is referring all calls to
the people in Washington.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., an old friend of Dunne's, said in a
telephone call from his New York office, ``If the president has to
pick a Republican, he couldn't pick a more decent person than John
Dunne.''
   Rangel said Dunne has the legal experience and training ``that
the previous candidate lacked.''
   Lucas, a former sheriff and county executive from Detroit, was
charged by critics with lacking credentials for the post. His
nomination was blocked in August on a 7-7 vote in the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   Dunne has a reputation as a maverick in the Nassau County
Republican Party who ran on several occasions against its powerful
GOP machine.
   During most of his 24 years in the legislature, a part-time
post, he lived in Albany at the Fort Orange Club, which admitted
women to membership only last year.
   Dunne told Newsday in an interview last week that he would
resign his membership in the all-male Garden City Golf Club if
nominated to the Justice post. ``It would send the wrong message to
stay,'' he said. ``It would be inappropriate.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had backed Dunne for the post.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The accreditation ceremony for new
U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams was canceled Tuesday and no date was
fixed for him to present credentials, the Foreign Ministry said.
   It said Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, ruler of this Caribbean island
nation, was suffering from influenza.
   Although the U.S. Embassy said the government had not
``expressed its displeasure with Ambassador Adams,'' neither state
television nor the government daily L'Union mentioned his arrival
Friday night.
   At Port-au-Prince airport, the 48-year-old envoy spoke of the
Avril government's ``irrevocable promise ... to hand over power to
an elected civilian government,'' and said Haiti has a ``rendezvous
with democracy and free, honest, and secure elections.''
   His remarks, in French and Creole, were criticized by Le Petit
Samedi Soir, a rightist weekly that accused him of meddling in
Haitian affairs.
   ``The new American diplomat perhaps has the excuse of lack of
culture,'' wrote its political commentator, Frantz Bataille, ``but
one doesn't arrive, booted and helmeted, with a threat in one's
mouth.''
   A U.S. Embassy official, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, said he understood Avril ``was under the weather.''

   The legislature on Tuesday offered amnesty to
Soviet soldiers who committed crimes in Afghanistan, where Soviet
troops fought anti-Marxist rebels, the Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   The Supreme Soviet resolution, which applies to servicemen who
were in Afghanistan between December 1979 and February 1989, takes
effect Dec. 15.
   It is the second amnesty involving Afghan war veterans.
Prosecutor Alexander Sukharev said in July 1988 that soldiers who
turned against their country during the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan would be offered an amnesty.
   More than 100,000 Red Army troops began rolling into Afghanistan
in December 1979 to replace one communist government with another
and fight a growing Moslem insurgency.

<TEXT>
   Chief Raoni on Tuesday demanded that
President Jose Sarney's government act to stop the
``extermination'' of the Yanomami Indian tribe.
   ``President Sarney has no words and does not care that our
brothers are dying,'' Raoni, chief of the Txukarramae tribe, told a
news conference.
   Raoni toured 15 countries this year with British rock musician
Sting to raise funds for a 300-mile-by-435-mile reservation for
Indians.
   Raoni demanded that the government immediately remove an
estimated 40,000 gold prospectors he said were in the Yanomami
reserve in remote Roraima state on Brazil's northern border with
Venezuela.
   He said miners spread disease, made game scarce and contaminated
rivers with mercury used in panning.
   ``Our brothers are peaceful, they do not know how to fight to
defend themselves. Those who remain alive are only skin and
bones,'' Raoni said.
   Environmental and Indian protection groups told Congress this
week that 280 of the 9,000 Yanomamis had died in the last two years.
   An additional 170 Yanomamis are being treated for malaria,
venereal diseases, dysentary and malnutrition, said Maria Gorete
Goncalves of the Support Center of Indigenous Tribes at the
University of Brasilia.
   Brazil's native Indian population has dropped from an estimated
5 million when Portuguese explorers discovered the country in 1500
to about 220,000 today.
   ``Enough of death. We do not want our families to go on dying,''
Raoni said, adding that the Yanomamis need an emergency health plan.
   ``The Yanomamis are being decimated by a government that cares
only about the money of the miners,'' he said.
   Iris Pedro de Oliveira, president of the government's National
Indian Foundation, told a Senate Justice Committee Monday that the
Yanomamis' situation was desperate.
   He said the government lacks the resources to remove the miners
from the region.
   Raoni said, ``Use the army, the federal police, but Sarney must
comply with the constitution and revoke the genocidal decrees.''

   Animal rights activists appealed Tuesday to
visiting South Korean President Roh Tae-woo to curb the cruel
methods used in his country to kill dogs and cats for consumption.
   ``They boil them alive, hang them, and even blowtorch them to
death,'' said Richard Moore, director of the International Fund for
Animal Welfare.
   Moore was one of 50 protesters who gathered outside the Lord
Mayor's residence where Roh was speaking during a four-day visit to
Britain.
   Roh, who arrived in Britain on Monday, made no mention of the
issue in his lunch-time address in which he announced an
unspecified reduction in South Korean import tariff on Scotch
whisky.
   Roh held talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday
evening before attending a dinner in his honor at her official
Downing Street residence.
   Mrs. Thatcher expressed hope that barriers between North and
South Korea may be dismantled.
   ``With so many barriers now coming down, it may not be too much
to hope that North Korea will also be ready to respond to your
efforts to open a dialogue,'' she told her dinner guests.
   Roh said his support for democratic reforms in South Korea in
1987 effectively broke a political deadlock there.
   ``Democracy has just begun to take root in Korea,'' he said.
``We have turned our backs on the authoritarian rule which held
sway for so many years.''
   Earlier, demonstrators said 2 million cats and dogs are killed
cruelly each year in South Korea, where the meat is considered by
some to be a good protein source with a delicate taste.
   The protesters said they were not objecting to consumption of
dogs and cats, but to the means used to kill them. The South Korean
Embassy said the methods have become more humane.
   ``Problems arise because of some of the killing methods used by
elderly people in the countryside who don't know how to kill more
humanely, but in cities more sanitary and modernized practices are
used,'' said spokesman Byung Ho-suh.
   Kim Keran, who is trying to set up a Korean chapter of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, gave a letter to
a South Korean delegation calling for new laws to ensure that dogs
are killed humanel.
   ``Dog meat was first used when the country was very poor and
there was no other alternative,'' she said. ``But now the economy
is stronger there is no excuse to carry on this cruelty.''
   South Korean officials say international protests are based on a
misunderstanding that South Koreans eat their pets, rather than
dogs and cats bred for their meat.

   The 2,000 city officials from around the country
meeting Tuesday gave President Bush's housing secretary a standing
ovation for a emotional speech about a new housing and jobs program
for the poor.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp said
anti-poverty legislation enacted in the 1960s was ineffective and
based on ``paternalistic'' policies that promoted a permanent
underclass.
   ``Noble goals were frustrated by over-reliance on government
entitlements, over-reliance on the redistribution of wealth and an
attitude that poor people were unwilling or unable to become
entrepreneurs, producers, job holders and homeowners,'' Kemp told
the session of the National League of Cities convention.
   Kemp's talk focused the ``HOPE'' program unveiled earlier this
month by Bush. He also called on the cities to eliminate the
``outrageous red tape and regulations,'' such as some zoning and
rent control laws and that he said limit affordable housing.
   He said he has seen, through visits to housing projects across
the country, evidence that poor people can pull themselves out of
poverty with the type of programs Bush is now promoting.
   ``I reject the attitude that nothing can or should be expected
from poor Americans,'' Kemp said.
   Bush's $2.1 billion program provides grants for non-profit
housing groups, rehabilitation of vacant public housing units,
anti-drug programs and service-supported housing for the homeless,
Kemp said.
   Kemp said he also has directed the Federal Housing
Administration to set aside 10 percent of FHA-foreclosed housing
for lease to non-profit groups to help the homeless.

<HEAD>Says El Salvador Using Weapons Plane to Deflect Attention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega has accused
the Salvadoran government of using the case of an arms-smuggling
plane as a way to deflect attention from the violence wracking El
Salvador.
   The Nicaraguan leader said the problem in neighboring Salvador
is the ``need to have a cease-fire, to reach a peace agreement.''
   A twin-engine plane painted black and without registration
numbers crashed Saturday in southern El Salvador and the four
crewmen perished. It was found to be carrying weapons and
ammunition including 24 Soviet-made anti-aircraft rockets.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani suspended diplomatic
relations with Nicaragua Sunday, saying he had no doubt the plane
was from Nicaragua and the weapons were for Salvadoran rebels.
   Ortega, speaking to a group of church leaders Monday, did not
comment directly on Cristiani's accusations.
   He said the plane was not the problem, ``The problem is that the
people of El Salvador are being murdered, their human rights
violated. The Salvadoran government bombs the population and kills
Jesuits priests.''
   He referred to the Nov. 16 slayings of six Jesuit educators in a
house in San Salvador. Witnesses said men in military uniforms
killed the priests.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the Salvadoran
government was trying to create a new ``Hasenfus'' case.
   Eugene Hasenfus was an American aboard a cargo plane downed Oct.
5, 1986, in Nicaragua.
   Nicaragu said the plane had taken off from a Salvadoran airport
and was carrying weapons to Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
Hasenfus was convicted of arms smuggling but was released in
December 1986 and returned to the United States.
   Ortega said that in the Hasenfus case ``there was clear evidence
that the Contras were being supplied with the cooperation of the
Salvadoran military.
   ``We did not break relations then. On the contrary, we have
always sought a negotiated solution.''
   The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said the pilot killed
in Saturday's crash was a Nicaraguan air force captain and
identified him as Mauricio Quiroz Garcia, 36.
   But a man with that name was alive and well in Managua.
   Mauricio Quiroz Garcia, 36, told The Associated Press in Managua
he had been piloting a commercial flight from Managua to San Jose,
Costa Rica, for Aeronica, the national airline, on Saturday.
   ``I'm totally baffled,'' he said.
   The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry was asked about the case and
said it would check again with the armed forces.
   In New York, El Salvador's ambassador to the United Nations,
Ricardo G. Castaneda, relayed his government's request for an
emergency Security Council meeting to deal with Nicaragua's
``aggression.''

   A man and the two teen-agers he allegedly
hired for $10,000 to stab and strangle his pregnant wife were
charged Tuesday with capital murder.
   Kenneth Johnson, 37, and the two teen-agers entered no pleas and
were ordered held without bail. The charge carries the death
penalty.
   Andrew Serell, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
case, would not disclose a motive, saying only, ``We have some
theories.''
   The partially clothed body of Sharon Johnson, 36, who was seven
months pregnant, was found in a gravel pit near a Bedford
construction site in July 1988.
   Johnson, who had lived with his wife in Bow and later moved to
Warwick, R.I., was arrested without incident Tuesday in Warren,
R.I., at the restaurant where he worked part-time, said Warren
Police Chief Robert Pare.
   Johnson waived extradition and was rushed to New Hampshire.
   Anthony Pfaaf, 19, of Wallace, N.C., and formerly of Manchester,
and Jason Carroll, 19 and the son of a Bedford police officer, were
arrested Monday night. Police Chief David Bailey said Carroll's
mother was not involved in the investigation.
   State Police Sgt. Roland Lamy said Pfaaf knew the Johnsons from
``having impregnated'' Johnson's daughter from a previous marriage,
Lisa, when she was 16.
   Lamy said Lisa left the Johnson household in May 1988 to live
with her mother, Bernadette Paquette, in Warwick, R.I. Lisa Johnson
and her child are living in Rhode Island.
   ``Bernadette Paquette was very helpful in the investigation,''
Lamy said.
   Pfaaf ``was approached by Johnson and Pfaaf then approached
Carroll,'' Serell said.
   As he was being led from the courtroom, Pfaaf told reporters he
is innocent.
   ``I didn't have anything to do with this,'' he said. ``You can
put that on your TVs.''
   The night she was killed, Mrs. Johnson left her job at a
computer company, drove to Massachusetts to buy a lottery ticket,
then headed north to a shopping mall in Manchester, where her car
was later found.
   Her body was found the next morning by a construction worker.
   At the time, Johnson told police he assumed his wife was working
late and that he was angry she had not called to say where she was.
He has said he fell asleep on the couch around midnight.
   When he awoke the next morning, he assumed she had come in
during the night and left again for work, he said.
   Johnson said someone who worked with his wife called around 9
a.m. to say she hadn't come to work. At that point _ after her body
had been discovered _ he reported her missing to police.

   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said Tuesday
he was outraged that Bush administration officials had suggested
publicly that a Connecticut woman is guilty of aiding rebels in El
Salvador.
   ``When an American is in legal trouble in another country,
particularly a country in which the tradition of equal justice is
not firmly established, the U.S. government ought to either
publicly insist on its citizen's innocence or keep its official
mouth shut,'' Dodd said in a written statement.
   ``It may be news in some quarters of the White House and the
State Department, but we have a tradition in this country of
presuming the innocence of persons who have been arested unless and
until they are proven guilty,'' added Dodd, who chairs the Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.
   Jennifer J. Casolo, 28, a native of Thomaston, Conn., was
arrested Sunday and Salvadoran police confiscated tons of
ammunition buried in the garden of her home in San Salvador. They
said the arms were stored there by guerrillas. Ms. Casolo had
rented the house for three months with a roommate who left the
country the morning before the raid.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of Ms. Casolo on
Monday: ``There are indications of her involvement, that's for
certain.
   `It's fairly clear that these weapons were found there. I mean,
we're not talking about a small package of pistols here. We're
talking about tons of equipment and mortars and dynamite and rounds
of ammunitions and explosives. This is hardly a case of someone
having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way home.''
   On Tuesday, a Justice Department official said that agency is
trying to determine whether Ms. Casolo should be charged with
violating the Neutrality Act, which prohibits private U.S. citizens
from taking sides in wars in which the United States is not
involved.
   Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents were reviewing the
circumstances of the case but had not opened a formal
investigation, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   To establish a violation of the Neutrality Act, prosecutors
would probably have to show that the woman was part of an effort to
ship arms from the United States to the Salvadoran rebels, the
official said.
   Evidence that a person stored weapons for rebels would not
necessarily constitute a violation of the law, the official said.
   U.S. authorities had not eliminated the possibility Ms. Casolo
was framed, the official said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Ms.
Cosolo technically is being held incommunicado by the National
Police but is being allowed regular visits by a U.S. consular
officer. Salvadoran officials said she has not been charged.
   Ms. Casolo was visited by Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. A doctor
who examined her at the request of the U.S. Embassy reported she is
in good health.
   Ms. Casolo's friends say she was framed by Salvadoran
authorities as part of an effort to discredit the church. She
provides tours of El Salvador as a representative of the San
Antonio, Texas-based Christian Education Seminars, to visiting
church members and others.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Tuesday the United States is obligated to pay its U.N. dues
even if the General Assembly votes to recognize the PLO as the
nation of Palestine.
   With a showdown vote between the United States and PLO looming
Friday, diplomats said they have little hope for a compromise that
would avert a U.S. cutoff of funds for the United Nations.
   On Monday, the Palestine Liberation Organization said Arab
nations plan to push a resolution through the General Assembly
recognizing the PLO as an observer nation.
   The State Department immediately threatened to cut off all U.S.
support for the United Nations if the General Assembly approved the
step. Washington is assessed $216 million annually, one-fourth of
the U.N. budget.
   ``I don't like the word `threat,''' Perez de Cuellar said
Tuesday. ``You cannot threaten me if I ask you to pay what you owe
me, don't you think so?
   ``Sometimes I think I have the impression that the Americans
think that they're making a loan. The Americans ought to pay what
they owe.
   ``What I don't understand is the link, how they link the two
things together,'' he said.
   ``It is an obligation under the U.N. Charter, it's a treaty
obligation,'' added his spokesman, Francois Giuliani.
   European and Nordic diplomats, who often play a buffer role in
the recurring U.S.-PLO confrontations, worked on a compromise but
said privately they had little hope.
   The anticipated assembly action also could jeopardize U.S.-PLO
talks, Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R.
Pickering, said Tuesday.
   ``It has serious consequences for the peace process in the
Middle East, our ongoing dialogue with the PLO, a lot of very
important issues, issues that I would say should be much more
important to the PLO than the mere change on a nameplate here in
the United Nations,'' he said.
   The United States has been engaged in talks since December with
PLO representatives in Tunis, Tunisia, through U.S. Ambassador
Robert Pelletreau.
   The PLO wants its status as a permanent observer mission raised
from that of organization to nation, like North Korea and South
Korea, Monaco, the Vatican, San Marino and Switzerland.
   Observer nations don't have voting rights and can speak only if
invited by the assembly.
   Upgrading the PLO's status would take a simple majority vote of
the 159 General Assembly members. As a member of the 102-member
Non-Aligned Movement, the PLO has more than enough votes to prevail.
   A Western diplomat said the Europeans were holding talks with
the PLO and United States to try to find ``a way out,'' but did not
sound encouraging.
   ``The effects of the U.S. withholding would be extremely
damaging at this time,'' he said.
   The United States has paid $65 million of its $216 million
assessment, but is still more than $307 million in arrears to the
regular budget from withholding U.N. dues during the Reagan
administration.
   Former President Ronald Reagan ordered U.S. dues withheld until
the world body trimmed its budget and bureaucracy.
   Last year he expressed satisfaction with the United Nations'
progress in reform and ordered full repayment of U.S. dues, but
Congress has not authorized payment of the arrears, citing budget
deficits.
   Congress recently passed a foreign appropriations bill that
requires the Bush administration to cut funds for any group that
moves to recognize the PLO or upgrade its status.
   Last year, the PLO declared the existence of a state of
Palestine in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the
PLO says 117 nations have recognized it.
   The United States, most European nations and a few from Latin
America have not, saying it lacks the basic attributes of a nation,
such as sovereignty and secure borders.

<TEXT>
   A prominent right-wing
politician was assassinated Tuesday morning by gunmen who ambushed
his car on a busy San Salvador street.
   The victim, Francisco Jose Guerrero, was a former presidential
candidate and served as foreign minister and chief justice of the
Supreme Court.
   Police said a bodyguard shot to death one attacker and another
was wounded. But the military said later one attacker was killed
and a Guerrero bodyguard was wounded.
   The military said four assailants were involved and blamed
leftist guerrillas. No group claimed responsibility.
   Witnesses and officials said the attack occurred at 9:40 a.m.
and Guerrero, shot once in the throat, managed to drive several
hundred yards to a hospital, where he died.
   Rebels and soldiers battled again early Tuesday in the capital's
northern neighborhoods of Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado.
   After the fighting died down, reporters saw the bodies of eight
guerrillas. Government casualties were not reported.
   The battle began about 3 a.m. with mortar barrages and
machine-gun and rifle fire. Three helicopter gunships strafed
guerrilla positons. Shooting tapered off in midmorning.
   Both areas had been scenes of heavy fighting during the
offensive the rebels launched Nov. 11. Most of the rebel force
withdrew last week but guerrilla patrols had been seen in both
Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado.
   It was the first time this week that fighting in the capital
zone was more than brief exchanges of gunfire.
   Guerrero, 64, represented conservative landowners in their
successful bid to remove a key phase of the land reform program in
the 1970s.
   He was a founder of the National Conciliation Party, the
government party during military rule in the 1960s and '70s.
   Guerrero served as foreign minister in 1968-71 and ran for
president in 1984 against Jose Napoleon Duarte, a centrist
Christian Democrat, who won in a runoff. Guerrero was president of
the Supreme Court for five years during the Duarte administration.
   The Christian Democrats were defeated in an election this year
by the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   In another development, the rebel high command denied any
connection with Jennifer Jean Casolo, an American arrested Sunday
by police who said they found tons of ammunition buried in the
garden of her home in San Salvador. A broadcast on the rebels'
clandestine Radio Venceremos said the rebels deny ``any link
between this North American citizen and our vanguards and regards
this as a vulgar frame-up by the armed forces and the government
... as part of their persecution of churches, humanitarian
organizations and everyone else connected with aiding the poor.''
   Ms. Casolo, 28, a native of Thomaston, Conn., represented the
Texas-based Christian Education Seminars.
   Police said the arms were buried by rebels on the grounds of the
house that Ms. Casolo had rented for three months.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday of Ms.
Casolo, ``There are indications of her involvement, that's for
certain.''
   Also Tuesday, diplomatic and church sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said American Baptist Church missionary
Ruth Mooney was arrested, held overnight by Treasury Police and
released on condition she leave the country.
   They said she was arrested Monday in Santa Ana, 35 miles
northwest of San Salvador, and brought to the capital Monday
evening, where a U.S. consular official met with her at Treasury
Police headquarters.
   President Alfredo Cristiani's government contends most
humanitarian organizations linked to foreign churches are little
more than guerrilla front groups.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said Tuesday in Washington he
was outraged by comments by Bush administration officials.
   ``When an American is in legal trouble in another country,
particularly a country in which the tradition of equal justice is
not firmly established, the U.S. government ought to either
publicly insist on its citizen's innocence or keep its official
mouth shut,'' Dodd said.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Ms. Casolo
technically is being held incommunicado by national police but is
being allowed regular visits by a U.S. consular officer.
   A U.S. Justice Department official said the agency is trying to
determine if Ms. Casolo should be charged with violating the
Neutrality Act, which prohibits private U.S. citizens from taking
sides in wars where the United States is not involved.
   He added U.S. authorities have not eliminated the possibility
Ms. Casolo was framed.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot's log of a jetliner that
crashed with no survivors indicates a three-inch fissure was found
in the fuselage three days before the plane exploded in the air, a
Bogota newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The 26-year-old Avianca airlines Boeing 727 carried 101
passengers and six crew members when it exploded Monday morning,
five minutes after taking off from Bogota on a domestic flight to
Cali.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Avianca's public relations
office refused comment on the El Tiempo report and would not
identify herself.
   Tom Cole of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle said late
Tuesday that the manufacturer had not received any report of the
crack. He said newspaper clippings from Colombia that had been
received by Boeing indicated ``this was a model airplane, that it
had a clean maintenance record.''
   Boeing says the 727 aircraft was delivered to Pan Am on May 28,
1966. Pan Am transferred the plane to Avianca at the end of
December 1975.
   El Tiempo gave no further details, but a spokesman for the paper
said policemen had found the log. Scores of policemen were involved
in searching the wreckage Monday.
   Col. Edgar Lesmes, assistant director of the Civil Air
Authority, said the agency did not have the log and was trying to
determine whether it had been found.
   ``The only thing we have been able to establish is that there
was an in-flight explosion for unknown reasons,'' he said in an
interview with the Caracol radio network.
   He said investigators have found no trace of explosives or
explosive devices in the wreckage.
   Col. Jorge Gonzalez, the agency's chief of operations, told a
news conference oxygen masks had dropped from the overhead
consoles. That is automatic in a case of pressure loss, and would
occur if an explosion ripped a hole in the cabin.
   Wreckage was spread over six miles, but most was within an area
about two miles long in grassy hills south of Bogota.
   A spokesman for the Colombian Pilots Association told The
Associated Press on Monday night: ``Given the circumstances of the
crash, I would say that it was a terrorist attack.''
   An Avianca pilot said the crew probably would have spotted
trouble in advance if mechanical failure had caused the accident.
   Both pilots asked to remain anonymous so their jobs would not be
put in jeopardy.
   On Monday, the Civil Aviation Authority said no problems had
been reported by the plane's crew.
   Lesmes said a flight recorder of cockpit conversation was found,
but another instrument recording flight data still was missing.
   Caracol's Bogota station said Tuesday it believed a telephone
call claiming drug traffickers blew up the plane may have been a
hoax.
   Three hours after the crash, a man called the station and said
the Extraditables, referring to drug traffickers who could be
extradited to the United States, were responsible.
   Station executives decided the call may not have been authentic
because the man was babbling and emotional, a spokesman for Caracol
said privately.
   Investigators from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have
found no evidence that drug cartels were responsible, Justice
Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said in Washington.
   Bombs have exploded at hotels, restaurants, supermarkets,
shopping centers and other public places in Colombia in the past
three months, killing 29 people and wounding 236. Drug traffickers
are trying to dissuade the Colombian government from extraditing
suspects to the United States.
   Numerous witnesses have told radio stations and newspapers they
saw two explosions Monday and that the plane fell in pieces.
   El Tiempo published an account by a man who said he spent 15 or
20 minutes each morning watching planes through binoculars after
they took off from the Bogota airport.
   John Bautista Polanco said he was following the Avianca plane
when, ``boom, it became a big, red ball of flames. And then it
broke apart and started to fall. There were two balls of flames,
which began to look like columns as the plane went down.
   ``The plane had been transformed in a second. Nothing unusual
happened before that. I saw that everything looked normal. ...
There wasn't any smoke or anything out of the ordinary.''

   A member of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board and two Venezuelan pilots were killed
when their plane crashed during a rainstorm in mountains west of
Caracas, it was reported Tuesday.
   The U.S. Embassy said four other U.S. citizens survived the
crash Monday night, but were injured. They were returning from a
weekend visit to Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world,
at Canaima, 400 miles southeast of Caracas.
   The Venezuelan Civilian Aviation agency said the twin-engine
Cessna crashed as it approached the Charallave municipal airport,
apparently because of the weather.
   Joseph Trippe Nall, 47, the NTSB member who perished, was in
Venezuela to attend a transportation seminar, said Barbara Moore of
the U.S. Information Service. The pilots were identified as Dickson
Naranjo and Jose Vargas.
   Civil Aviation officials identified the survivors as Jerri
Alles, an official of the Federal Aviation Administration; her
husband, David Halley, who worked at an FAA hangar at Washington
National Airport; NTBS member Kenneth Pepper, Nall's assistant, and
Kay Bond. Ms. Bond, a producer at Maryland Public Television for
the show ``AM Weather,'' apparently was on vacation.
   They were taken to the Hospital de Clinicas in Caracas with
``burns and other injuries,'' said Cesar Jara, Civil Aviation
director. `They are all out of danger and they'll probably be
released from the hospital tomorrow,'' he said.
   Transport Ministry officials said the plane was approaching the
airport about 30 miles west of Caracas when it crashed at 7:30 p.m.
La Carlota airport in Caracas is not equipped for night landings
and planes coming in after sunset are sent to Charallave.
   They said Civil Aviation investigators went to the scene to try
to determine the specific cause of the accident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has five members and
Nall's successor will be named by presidential appointment. By law,
the position must go to a Democrat to keep a political balance on
the board, which now has three Republicans and one Democrat.
   Nall was appointed to the transportation board April 11, 1986,
by President Reagan. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents
and incidents, determines their cause and makes recommendations to
other agencies and organizations to increase safety.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., a member of the Senate Commerce
Committee, called Nall ``a public servant of the highest
distinction.''
   ``Mr. Nall participated in a number of accident investigations
and testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on a number of
occasions,'' Ford said. ``In this capacity, he provided a
tremendous service to the safety of our transportation system.''
   Nall, a lawyer from Smithfield, N.C., was a native of Atlanta.
He also was a pilot and operated Nall Aviation Enterprises, a
ground school at Johnston County Airport in Smithfield, the NTSB
said.

   An ABC-TV charter bus en
route to a Monday night football game had ``nowhere to go'' when a
commuter train slammed into it, killing two network executives, a
police spokesman said.
   It appears that the bus driven by Paul Cang, 34, of Foster City,
got caught in heavy traffic while trying to cross the Southern
Pacific tracks at the Oyster Point Boulevard railroad crossing,
less than two miles from the Candlestick Park game site, Police
Sgt. Mike Guglielmoni said.
   ``The gates came down, the lights went on, the bells started
ringing and there was no place to go,'' said John Sanchez, 45, who
was at the wheel of a tractor-trailer in front of the International
Coach Co. bus. ``The train was blowing its horn continuously, and I
pulled up as far as I could.
   ``I couldn't go any farther without climbing the car in front of
me. The bus was trapped, because there were cars stopped in the
other direction, so he couldn't go around me.''
   Said Guglielmoni: ``He just had nowhere to go _ there was a
large truck in front of him.''
   The Caltrain diesel locomotive, traveling from San Francisco to
Burlingame, hit the bus at 60 mph, pushing it 50 feet down the
tracks and spinning it 180 degrees.
   Killed in the accident were Kurt Michael Sanger, 50, of New
York, and Adele Roffis, 61, of Culver City, Calif.
   The bus carried part of a group of ABC employees and guests who
had taken a cruise on San Francisco Bay and were headed to
Candlestick Park to watch the National Football League game between
the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers, said Bob Wheeler,
manager of sports information for ABC.
   Cang was reported in stable condition with cuts and head
injuries Tuesday at Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame.
   The California Highway Patrol was summoned to help with the
police investigation. Guglielmoni said the CHP report, plus
toxicology tests voluntarily taken by Cang to check for traces of
drugs or alcohol, will be forwarded to the San Mateo County
district attorney's office for review.
   There was no indication that drugs or alcohol were involved in
the accident, police said.
   Records at the California Department of Motor Vehicles show Cang
has been convicted three times in the past 17 months for traffic
violations, two of which occurred while he was driving a bus.
   International Coach declined to comment on the accident or
Cang's driving record.
   A state Public Utilities Commission survey, released last June,
listed the railroad crossing as in urgent need of improvement
because of heavy traffic, and 11th-ranked of the 82 crossings most
needing repair throughout California.

   A soldier claiming to be the
cousin of South Africa's defense minister is seeking asylum after
accusing his army unit of killing and torturing civilians, an
Amsterdam organization said Tuesday.
   The Dutch Anti-Apartheid Movement identified the man as Corp.
Mervyn Malan, 27, and said he had served with a reconnaissance unit
known as Recce 5.3 that was part of South Africa's special forces.
   A statement issued by the movement quoted Malan as saying Recce
5.3 engaged in systematic ``torture ... bombing of villages and .
.. burning of women and children'' in Namibia and Angola.
   It reported he said, ``I have seen and done terrible things. I
will never be part of any killing again.
   ``My cousin, the general (Defense Minister Magnus Malan),
doesn't protect me. He's the one who wants me killed.''
   Anti-Apartheid Movement spokesman Bart Luirink told The
Associated Press the self-professed defector described himself as a
``full cousin'' to the defense minister but did not know the exact
family links.
   He reported South African Defense Ministry officials said they
had never heard of a Corp. Malan.
   The statement reported the defector gave this account about
leaving South Africa:
   He fled to Swaziland in 1988 after ignoring a callup for a
second tour of duty with the special forces in which he served from
1982-85.
   He was pursued to Swaziland by a special forces group and
decided to come to the Netherlands in December 1988.
   The decision to request political asylum was made several months
ago because the publicity ``could serve his cause.''
   The Justice Ministry was closed at the time the statement was
distributed and it could not be determined if an asylum request had
been received and was being processed.
   Malan decided to quit the army after being involved in an April
1988 raid in Namibia where he was ordered to throw phosphorous
grenades into a civilian truck carrying women and children,
according to the statement.
   Luirink reported Malan said all of the people were killed, but
he had no figures.
   Namibia is a territory that was administered by South Africa's
white-minority government until this fall when elections were held
under a U.N.-sponsored agreement. The accord provides for
independence for the territory, also known as South-West Africa.
   Namibia is sandwiched between South Africa and Angola, and for
years South African forces went into Angola to attack bases of
South-West Africa Organization guerrillas fighting for independence.

   Teen survivors of the nation's worst
alcohol-related traffic disaster on Tuesday recounted the panic on
a burning church bus after it collided with a pickup truck headed
the wrong way down an interstate highway.
   ``It looked like somebody was standing in the front of the bus
with a flamethrower,'' said Jess Durrance, 17, of Radcliff,
describing the May 14, 1988 accident that killed 27 people on
Interstate 71, about five miles south of Carrollton.
   Durrance said he tried in vain to kick out windows to escape the
flames and smoke, then ran to the back of the bus where he found
``everybody was trying to squish and push through'' a rear
emergency exit.
   His testimony came in the trial of Larry Mahoney, 36, of rural
Owen County, who is charged with 27 counts of murder, 12 counts of
first-degree assault, 42 counts of wanton endangerment and one
count of drunken driving.
   Mahoney broke into tears as Carroll County Coroner James B. Dunn
gave graphic descriptions of bodies found inside the bus. His
sobbing prompted Carroll Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite to order
a recess.
   ``I couldn't believe what I had seen,'' Dunn said. ``I thought I
was having a nightmare.'' He said the bodies of 17 children were
found sprawled in the aisle and on seats in the rear of the bus.
   Families of the victims clasped hands tightly and dabbed tears
with handkerchiefs during Dunn's testimony.
   Russell Baldani, one of Mahoney's three attorneys, said during
recess he didn't know what effect Mahoney's sobbing would have on
the jury.
   ``It's nothing staged. I'm sure they don't think that,'' Baldani
said. ``Hopefully, they will sympathize with Larry and what he's
going through.''
   In other testimony, Sgt. Jim Sharon of the Kentucky State Police
compared what he saw at the crash to carnage he had seen in Vietnam.
   ``Bodies were black and charred, skin burned, and (emergency
medical technicians) were working on them,'' Sharon said.
   Mahoney's attorneys, during cross-examination, began building
their case that the former school bus carrying 67 people was unsafe.
   The survivors described climbing over seats to sit with friends
and people lying in the aisles during a trip home from a
Cincinnati-area amusement park.
   ``It's no secret that's a big factor in our favor,'' said
Baldani.
   William Summer, Mahoney's lead attorney, pointed out
contradictions in testimony the young witnesses gave to state
police troopers and to National Transportation Safety Board
investigators.
   Summer cross-examined Jamie Hardesty, 17, of Radcliff, about
statements given to the NTSB that he had seen bus seats and plastic
on the floor burning. Hardesty said he was not sure if he had seen
seats and the plastic burning.
   ``Everything seems to be forgotten unless it is right around
Larry Mahoney,'' Summer said.

   Often, rock performers' least interesting songs
are about the hardships of touring. Playwright Kathleen Tolan has
brought a similar concept about her craft to the stage in ``Kate's
Diary,'' with similar results.
   The play opened Tuesday night off-Broadway in the Public
Theater's small Susan Stein Shiva Theater. David Greenspan directed.
   The play mixes scenes from Kate's ``real'' life and from a play
she has written. There is some cleverness in the juxtaposition of
scenes. Although the scenes aren't labeled, a viewer doesn't get
mixed up. But neither does a viewer get involved.
   In the first scene, Kate, acted by Lizbeth Mackay, sits on her
double bed as Michael Bryan French and Laura Hughes enact a murder
scene from her play.
   French also plays Frank, who lives with Kate. Hughes also plays
Kate's friend, to whom Kate complains about Frank. The bloom has
long gone from Kate and Frank's romance and the two constantly
irritate each other. It's a surprise when we learn in the last
scene that they've gone ahead with their planned marriage.
   One scene from Kate's play has Rafael Baez as Pablo, a
Salvadoran peasant, recount how, as a soldier for the government,
he had to shoot villagers chosen for sacrifice by their villages,
until he broke down. It's a moving monologue.
   However, when a successful playwright (John Griesemer)
condescendingly tells Kate that her play's characters and
situations don't add up, he seems to have the right idea.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze appeared
to criticize the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in an
interview published Tuesday in the Italian Communist Party
newspaper L'Unita.
   ``If there is an organic link between what is happening now and
what happened in 1968, I believe that the Czechoslovaks themselves
must respond,'' Shevardnadze was quoted as saying.
   ``You know that we respect very much this principle and we place
a lot of value on it: It is the principle of freedom of choice, of
non-interference. These principles were always proclaimed, but not
always respected. Now we are scrupulously following them and we act
in such a way that our words are not different from our acts.''
   L'Unita reported Shevardnadze said that in the Soviet Union and
East bloc countries ``the principal tendency is the democratization
of society, the formation of a democratic socialism.''
   Turning to this weekend's U.S.-Soviet summit, Shevardnadze was
quoted as saying he did not rule out ``agreements on basic choices
capable of enriching Soviet-American relations with new political
substance and new refinements.''

   It was pretty tacky when the U.S. Postal Service
refused to accept its newly issued no-lick stamp, but a postal
official trying to put the best face on a sticky situation admitted
he was licked.
   ``We probably did our usual terrible job of internal marketing,
and didn't let our employees know we were test marketing this,''
said Dick Able, postal service marketing director in Denver, where
the stamps are being tested.
   ``It sounds like we've already antagonized one customer,'' he
said.
   Edward Cook, an airline consultant, got a bit unglued after the
San Francisco post office didn't recognize the tacky-back stamp on
a letter he was trying to send to his daughter at Stanford
University.
   Not only did the Postal Service return his letter marked ``Not a
postage stamp,'' but the postman also charged him 25 cents for
returning his letter.
   The new stamps, which cost an extra 3 cents each, are guaranteed
to stick without licking.
   ``I didn't want to pay 28 cents for a stamp I could get for 25
cents, but my wife wanted to try them,'' Cook said. ``I'm sure not
buying any more.''
   In the meantime, the post office has offered Cook free delivery
of his letter, and an apology.
   Able said there has been a surge in demand for the new stamp,
but he doesn't know why.
   ``We don't know if it's because they like them, or they think
these will be the first, last and only version, and they'll become
a collector's item,'' he said.

   Presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa on
Tuesday challenged President Alan Garcia to a debate after an angry
exchange of charges in the campaign for next year's election.
   Palace spokesman Carlos Guillen said Garcia rejected the
challenge. Garcia is barred by the constitution from seeking
re-election.
   Vargas Llosa, a novelist who is considered the front-running
candidate for the April 8 election, called Garcia ``shameless,''
and accused the president's center-left Aprista party of spreading
lies.
   On Monday, Garcia said Vargas Llosa had promised to fire 500,000
public workers if elected, and the president said the government
employs only 507,000 people.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Vargas Llosa denied he had said he
would fire a half million employees and said he would resign his
candidacy if Garcia could prove that he did.
   ``Where is the recording of that declaration?'' said Vargas
Llosa. ``I defy President Alan Garcia to show that recording.''
   He also disputed Garcia's figures, saying the government employs
more than 1.6 million people.
   Vargas Llosa is running on a platform to reduce the government
bureaucracy and budget deficit.
   Police reported the decapitated bodies of two teachers and a
lawyer were found Monday near Chanchamayo, 140 miles east of Lima.
The three men had been kidnapped a few days before the Nov. 12
municipal elections by a group of armed men wearing military
uniforms, according to police.
   They said the three were active in the United Left party.
   No group asserted responsibility for the killings, officials
reported.
   Guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement killed scores of
candidates and party activists in their effort to disrupt the
elections.
   Police also said the mayor and two councilmen of San Martin de
Pangoa, 175 miles east of Lima, were abducted Tuesday by Shining
Path rebels.
   The police said Mayor Mauro Caballero belongs to the United Left
party and the councilman are members of the Aprista party.
   Government reports say more than 16,000 people have been killed
in violence related to the Shining Path insurgency since it began
in 1980.

   Two plastic surgeons worked a miracle for
a young man from Bolivia who had a quarter of his brain and part of
his skull blown away by a bullet five years ago.
   ``I can't believe it, it's incredible,'' Pacho Penaloza, 21,
said Monday through interpreter Jose Trejo.
   Penaloza, who flies home Friday, said he's eager to return to
school.
   In 1984, in his hometown of La Paz, Bolivia, Penaloza and a
friend were looking at the friend's father's pistol when it fired.
The bullet entered just above Penaloza's left eye and emerged from
the back of his head.
   He survived surgery, but his prognosis was grim, doctors told
his mother, Elvira Rosales. Paralysis of his right side was
expected, and she said she was told he wouldn't speak again. He was
in a coma for two months.
   But when he awoke, his efforts to speak, regain his strength and
write with his left hand astonished his family and doctors. The
major problem, which his doctors were incapable of treating, was
that his brain was extremely vulnerable, covered on the left side
by only a thin layer of scar tissue.
   When his mother heard that Ana Trejo, was visiting from St.
Paul, working on an adoption project for the Children's Home
Society of Minnesota, Ms. Rosales crashed a luncheon and asked her
to find help for her son.
   Two years after the shooting, everything was arranged except the
paperwork to get Penaloza out of the country, said Mrs. Trejo's
husband, Jose. It was three more years before Penaloza would reach
the United States.
   United Hospital, where Trejo was a board member, had agreed to
provide hospitalization. Joseph Skow and Frank Pilney were to
perform the delicate reconstructive operation, with a neurosurgeon
on standby.
   Finally, in July, Penaloza arrived in St. Paul.
   Skow and Pilney said Monday that the first step was to stretch
Pacho's scalp so they would have a flap of skin to cover the bone
graft with which they intended to cover his brain.
   Using a device more familiar in breast reconstruction surgery,
they installed an inflatable plastic pouch called a tissue expander
at the base of his skull. At weekly intervals over several months,
they injected the balloon with fluid, each time stretching the
scalp a little further.
   When the scalp was ready, the surgeons removed a plate of bone
from the right side of his head and split it longitudinally.
   ``It's like a sandwich,'' said Skow. ``The skull contains a
layer of blood vessels between two hard shells of bone. We put the
outer shell right back where we got it and grafted the other onto
the other side.''
   They also borrowed a section of his bottom-most right rib to
fill out the skull. The final step was to stretch the expanded
scalp over the bone graft to his left ear.
   ``Once all his hair grows back the defect will be hardly
noticeable,'' Skow said.
   Neurologically, Penaloza's development continues to be
promising, although his right fist remains clenched and he has a
slight limp. Initially there were concerns about his short-term
memory, but those problems seem to be fading, and his speech is
lucid.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday
proposed a German federation as part of a sweeping plan to reunite
the two countries after four decades of post-war division.
   East Germany has increasingly discussed the possibility of a
confederation, but the Communist nation's leader, Egon Krenz, ruled
out any talk of reunification.
   ``A unity of Germany isn't on the agenda,'' Krenz told West
Germany's ARD-TV network in insisting on the continued existence of
two ``sovereign, independent German states.''
   There are fears among Europeans in the East and the West about
the political and economic power of a reunified Germany with 80
million people.
   Kohl, in a speech to Parliament, sought to allay those fears,
saying: ``The Germans ... will be a dividend for a Europe that is
coming together, and never again a threat.''
   The United States favors reunification, and State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler reiterated that position in
Washington on Tuesday. The Soviet Union has said the idea is
``dangerous and unrealistic.''
   Kohl said he had no timetable in mind to carry out his ideas and
made it clear it could take years to form a federation. He said he
hoped to discuss his proposals with East German leaders at a summit
``before Christmas.'' On Monday, his spokesman, Hans Klein, said
the meeting might be held on Dec. 19.
   East German government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said Kohl's plan
in general provided ``interesting starting points for
negotiations.''
   But writer Stefan Heym and a number of other East German
artists, clerics and intellectuals rejected reunification, saying
they opposed their country ``being pocketed'' by West Germany. The
group said it would start a petition drive in support of its appeal.
   Kohl's proposals were the most thorough delineation he has made
yet of his vision of ending the division of Germany imposed after
World War II.
   Earlier, Hans-Jochen Vogel, the leader of the opposition Social
Democrats, proposed an eventual confederation as a step toward
unity.
   In the past, the Social Democrats have cautioned against
hastening toward German reunification; some in the leftist party
have flatly opposed it.
   ``We are now standing at the start of a new period in European
and German history, a period that points beyond the status quo or
the hitherto political structures in Europe,'' Kohl told Parliament.
   ``We are prepared ... to develop confederative structures
between the two states in Germany in order to create a federation,
a federal state in Germany.''
   A federation is a union of states with a central government; a
confederation is an alliance of independent nations for a common
purpose.
   Kohl also said reunification must be ``bedded in the
pan-European process and in East-West relations. The future
structure of Germany must fit into the whole architecture of Europe
as a whole.''
   He said his proposal could only be carried out if East Germany
holds free elections, as it has promised.
   The chancellor proposed creation of joint governmental and
parliamentary committees for ``permanent consultation'' between the
Germanys.
   He also suggested such committees to deal with economic,
environmental, cultural and scientific matters, and he said they
could be set up soon after free elections in East Germany.
   Kohl said West Germany is prepared to offer ``concrete
assistance'' to embattled East Germany, where it is urgently needed.
   But he said massive assistance would be contingent on East
Germany ``irreversibly'' setting into motion ``a fundamental change
of its political and economic system.''
   East Germany has rejected previous demands that it replace its
planned economy with a market-oriented one.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said in Brussels,
Belgium, that Kohl's proposal for reunification was compatible with
the Western alliance's vision of a future Europe.
   The plan ``links the development of the German future to the
larger process of building Europe and to the existing institutions
of the West,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials began examining a rule
Tuesday that allows humans to swim with captive dolphins in hopes
of determining whether the benefits to some people are outweighed
by harm to the mammals.
   In the Florida Keys, home of three of the nation's four dolphin
swim parks, supporters say the programs give humans a better
understanding of dolphins and that the animals are protected
against overexposure to people.
   But some environmental groups say contact with untrained people
could be dangerous and that too little is known about the
transmission of diseases and effects on the dolphins' natural
bahavior.
   Both views were heard Tuesday in Islamorada as about 100 people
attended a public hearing by the National Marine Fisheries Service,
which regulates the dolphin swim programs. A series of hearings is
planned to help update the policy.
   ``I have on file thousands of letters from people expounding on
the virtues of their experience with the dolphins,'' said Michael
Wood, general curator of the Theater of the Sea in Islamorado.
``There is nothing to suggest any ill effects to the dolphins or
humans.''
   Nancy Daves Hicks, eastern regional director of the Animal
Protection Institute, said dolphins have become victims of their
own popularity.
   ``Dolphins do not knock on the front door of these facilities
and ask to be let in ... they are chased, netted and captured,''
she said.
   According to a federal study, 40,000 people are expected to
participate in swim-with-dolphins programs this year. The four
facilities have 34 Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and one California
sea lion in captivity.
   The dolphins do not seem harmed by the interaction with humans,
said Jeanne Burns, a spokeswoman at the Dolphin Research Center on
Grassy Key.
   ``Some dolphins in tanks with other dolphins actually want to
get into the tank with the humans,'' she said. ``There doesn't seem
to be any problems.''
   The center, whose five-year swim program is the nation's oldest,
allows 16 people a day in the dolphin tanks for 15 minutes, five
days a week.
   Besides satisfying curious tourists, the non-profit center has
conducted studies that indicate swimming with dolphins help the
learning process of emotionally and mentally disabled children, and
may improve competitive swimmers' performance.
   ``It's one of those wonderful things that pull on your heart
strings, but we have to be careful with programs such as these,''
said Laura Rubin, spokeswoman for the environmental group
Greenpeace.
   Bottlenosed dolphins, the species favored for the swim programs,
were devastated in recent years by mysterious mass deaths along the
Atlanti coast.
   ``It does not make sense to go out and capture an animal whose
stocks are already depleted in its natural habitat,'' said Ms.
Rubin.
   Ms. Burns at the Dolphin Research Center said dolphins used for
the swim programs have been bred in captivity.

   For East Germany's Jews, the democratic
change battering the Communist government stirs new hopes and old
fears.
   ``I feel fearful when people get up and say, `Hang the
Communists,' because when it starts with the Communists it always
ends with the Jews,'' said economist and writer Irene Runge, a
prominent member of East Germany's tiny Jewish community.
   ``When newspapers say disaster threatens because Poles and other
foreigners are smuggling, this to me has the sound of the Nazis.''
   The crumbling of the Berlin Wall, however, has raised hopes that
the East German government will finally pay reparations to Jewish
victims of the Nazi Holocaust and to Israel, and hand over billions
of dollars worth of Jewish-owned buildings in East Berlin seized by
the Nazis.
   East Germany's decision Nov. 9 to let its 16.5 million citizens
travel freely also means that the isolated East German Jews _ 400
officially registered and some 4,000 others _ can have regular
contact with the approximately 37,500 Jews in West Germany and West
Berlin.

   President Bush will protest to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their weekend summit against
the ``outrageous behavior'' of Moscow's Central American allies,
but also will be prepared to discuss deeper troop cutbacks in
Europe, officials say.
   The subject of Central America was assured a more prominent

   Discovery's astronauts returned
home under a cover of darkness today after ending their secret
space mission with a sunset landing at a desert air base where
gusts twice delayed the return to Earth.
   A news blackout imposed by the military prevented the astronauts
from talking about what they did during their five-day mission, but
Commander Frederick Gregory did comment on one problem _ a
malfunctioning restroom.
   ``The crew performed, I think, flawlessly. Discovery's toilet
didn't work, but we fixed it,'' said Gregory, who was wearing a
slipper on one foot and shoe on the other. He suffered a foot
infection while in orbit, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration said.
   After staying in space an extra day and then an extra orbit
because of high winds, the spaceship and its five astronauts landed
at 4:30 p.m. PST Monday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

   To update collections in today's high-priced art
market, museums increasingly must put a price on the priceless.
   Curators haven't quite reached the level of ``I'll trade you two
Picassos for a Van Gogh,'' but museum boards are being forced to
sell off some works of art to buy others. Budgets are simply
dwarfed by the exponential growth in price of auctioned art works.
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, for example, has an
acquisitions budget of about $2 million. In a market where a
Vincent Van Gogh painting was recently sold for nearly $54 million,
that doesn't go far.
   Thursday, the museum will put eight American paintings on the
auction block to raise money to buy other American paintings. The
19th and 20th century paintings for sale include works by John
Singer Sargent, Maurice Prendergast, Albert Bierstadt and George
Inness.

   The Tennessee Valley Authority paid $172,700
to fly a manager between his Tennessee office and his Virginia home
for a year because officials believed the man would otherwise quit,
a congressional report says.
   The study, released Monday by the General Accounting Office, a
research agency of Congress, said the authority provided the
flights for Steven A. White between Oct. 2, 1987, and Sept. 30,
1988, while he was the TVA's nuclear power manager.
   White had been hired in January 1986 when the authority's
management was being criticized by Congress, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and others.
   ``TVA's board of directors ... believed that the special
transportation services were necessary to retain Mr. White's
management services,'' the GAO wrote.
   White lived in Charlottesville, Va., and worked in the TVA
office in Chattanooga, Tenn., a distance of more than 400 miles. He
left the agency Nov. 18, 1988.

   ``Echoes of Joy'' offers Aaron R. Moore some
challenges that directors of ordinary gospel choirs never know.
   When there are discipline problems, rehearsal stops and members
pray. It got so bad a year ago they had to report to Sunday morning
services and sit in the choir box without singing for a month.
   ``Initially, they were angry behind the disciplining, but later
they appreciated it,'' Moore said. Furthermore, they have to accept
the rules: they're prison inmates.
   The choir's first tape, ``We Are Not Ashamed,'' was a sellout.
But the blessing was mixed; Moore had to refuse the invitations to
perform that ensued, because only a few of the ``Echoes'' are
allowed to travel.
   And the choir is now an a capella group because the pianist
``got moved to maximum security a few years ago,'' said Chaplain
Frank Pennell of the Delaware Correctional Center near Smyrna. The
choir has ``done a good job without music.
   ``A majority of them are just learning how to sing and they pick
it up by ear. Some have sung on the street before.''
   Now they sing behind bars. Echoes of Joy, averaging 18 to 24
members, sings during Sunday and other Christian services at the
prison.
   Ira Shy grew up with Moore in Wilmington. ``I remember him from
when I was a little kid and I remember him always being a singer,''
Moore said. ``At one time we did sing together on a young adult
choir.''
   But Shy, 43, was in and out of jail as well as church. Shy,
serving 12{ years for drug trafficking, said his problems came from
not having a personal relationship with God. Now he has that
relationship, he said, and ``it's been easy since I decided to do
it right.''
   Being a ``born-again'' Christian is a prerequisite for
membership. ``We discern that when we interview,'' said Pennell.
Prospective members also take a 15-week class on basic Christian
principles, then serve a 60-day probation, and ``if everything's
fine, they stay on,'' he said.
   ``The Lord is working through the choir,'' said Arthur E.
Cleckly, 26, who has served two years of a three-year sentence for
intent to deliver marijuana. ``It's a blessing to see Christ
working in their lives. We may be cast down by society, but the
Lord has forgiven us.''
   Raymond C. Davis, 39, who wrote the title song of the choir's
second tape, ``Jesus Saves,'' was ``born again'' in 1986.
   ``I realized my life wasn't going anywhere. I was a drug addict,
an alcoholic ... and I had no relationship with my six kids. I
hadn't really been a father,'' said Davis, who became eligible for
parole in August after three years of a seven-year term for robbery
and conspiracy.
   ``I didn't have a friend in the world. That's how I know Jesus
saves. He stepped right in and showed me what I needed in my life.
... He has truly cured me of my drug addiction and took the taste
of alcohol from me.''
   About 200 of the 500 copies of ``Jesus Saves'' have been sold at
$5 each since it was recorded last December, Pennell said. All 500
copies of ``We Are Not Ashamed'' were sold within two years of its
1986 recording. The proceeds go to buy materials for Bible classes,
and members get $50 on release from prison.
   Choir rehearsals open with prayer, a Scripture and personal
testimonies.
   Then Moore takes over.
   If it's a new song, he sings it, then the choir sings it back.
   The members' enthusiasm, and their ability to learn quickly,
lets him know they enjoy it. ``They remember what they hear without
music and that's hard to do. Usually a person can remember a tune
before they remember the words. These brothers can remember a tune
and the words without music. That's a gift and an art to be able to
do that.''
   But there are problems.
   ``There are attitude problems. What they are mainly are
spiritual growth problems. The brothers are learning how to live
for Christ and dealing with it and sometimes they bring that stuff
to rehearsal,'' said Moore, 34, a minister, counselor and food
services director for the Marriott Corp. in Hockessin.
   ``They bring things from home and emotional things and sometimes
it can get to be a little too much for them.''

according to a recent University of Michigan study.
   Religious involvement helped increase self-esteem for older
blacks who help others and through association with the respected
institution of church, said Neal M. Krause, associate professor of
health gerontology at the university's School of Public Health.
   Personal beliefs that God will intervene in times of trouble
also help relieve stress, the study found.
   However, Krause and co-author Professor Thanh Van Tran of Boston
College found the study group members didn't necessarily increase
their religious involvement in times of trouble.

<HEAD>In Housing, Now Its The Buyer's Turn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sellers of homes have had an advantage over
buyers in much of the country throughout the 1980s, but that
situation is likely to change in the early 1990s.
   Among the chief reasons: a large inventory of unsold homes in
many parts of the country, falling mortgage rates and expectations
of cuts to come, and a relative decline in the age 25 to 34
homebuying population.
   In fact, the mid-20s to mid-30s age group that produced a bulge
of demand and higher prices in the 1980s is now shrinking as a
percentage of the population, although the impact on housing will
be delayed until late in the decade.
   At the same time, the age group 65 and older is growing larger,
and could be a cause of more family-size houses coming on the
market, a consequence of that age category's tendency to trade down
in search of convenience over space.
   How far mortgage rates will fall is debatable, but the trend is
lower and housing forecasters say it will continue into 1990.
   Three economists speaking at the annual convention of the
National Association of Realtors in Dallas this month agreed that
the first half of the next decade would be characterized by falling
interest rates.
   The national average commitment rate for conventional loans, in
double digits through much of the 1980s, had fallen to 9.79 percent
early this month, and loans of a half-percentage point below that
already have developed.
   The improved climate is reflected in more favorable home-buying
attitudes measured by the University of Michigan. In the October
survey, 26 percent of those interviewed mentioned the availability
of good buys. Should that percentage be maintained for an entire
quarter it would be a 30-year record.
   Internal changes in the mortgage market might also help would-be
buyers find the best possible rates. While there will be fewer
thrift institutions in the 1990s, the amount of money available for
mortgages might actually grow.
   One reason for the expectation, according to speakers at the
realtors' convention, is the prospect of greater participation in
the market by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   This secondary market, as it is called, will absorb a much
larger share of mortgages in the 1990s, according to John Tuccillo,
the realtors' chief economist. He also expects more overseas money
to flow into the home mortgage markets.
   In addition, it is expected that more stress will be aimed at
resolving the financing problems of low and moderate-income housing
as a result of provisions in the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act.
   Under FIRREA's affordable housing program, each federal home
loan bank will subsidize interest rates on advances to member
institutions making long-term loans on such housing.
   ``There will be a real emphasis to squeeze the (mortgage
finance) system down to the low-income portion of the housing
sector,'' Tuccillo said.
   Whatever the consequences of demographic and market conditions
now taking shape, there is little likelihood of prices soaring
during the 1990s, as they did in many areas during the 1980s.
   At the beginning of 1980, for instance, the price of a typical
starter home was $50,000. Realtor records show that in the third
quarter of this year a comparable house sold for $80,700.
   While convention speakers said they expected houses will
continue to appreciate, most looked for much more stability than
existed in the 1980s. And if interest rates remain below 10
percent, it creates a buying combination.

<HEAD>Sunday Is Lord's Day in Rural Churches, With or Without Priest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Sam Hayes drives 220 miles across eastern Wyoming each
weekend to say Mass at three rural churches. But when he's sick or
the weather makes travel impossible, the parishioners are on their
own.
   A priest can make it only one Sunday a month to St. Christopher
Mission in Unalaska at the end of the chain of Aleutian islands in
Alaska. The other weekends, Brenda Moscarella, a laywoman, puts the
services together.
   Despite criticism they will undermine the Sunday Mass tradition
in the United States, the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have approved
a rite for Sunday celebrations in the absence of a priest. It is
intended to help several hundred parishes where no clergy are
available some Sundays.
   ``What do we do on Sunday if there is no priest? Do we tell
those people to stay home?'' asked Bishop Michael J. Sheehan of the
Diocese of Lubbock in west Texas. ``It's the best we can do in the
situation we're in: namely, the priest shortage.''
   Sundays have always been special for Christians.
   There was no evidence until the late second century of separate
Easter celebrations of the resurrection of Jesus. For the early
church, every Sunday fulfilled the same function.
   More than half of the nation's 53 million Catholics attend Mass
on an average Sunday.
   ``Sunday is the Lord's Day,'' Sheehan said. ``The Catholic
Church wants the memory of the resurrection to stay alive in the
Catholic community.''
   With or without a priest.
   A 1987 survey taken by the Liturgy Committee of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops found there were already priestless
celebrations in 51 dioceses. An estimated 1,000 parishes are in
that situation. Sheehan said more such celebrations are expected as
the clergy shortage worsens.
   The number of American priests has dropped to 53,000 from 59,200
in 1970. The ratio of worshipers to priests has gone from about 700
per priest in 1955 to almost 1,000 today.
   The U.S. priestless rite, which still must be approved by the
Vatican, follows guidelines for such celebrations that the Vatican
devised in response to requests from several bishops' conferences
throughout the world.
   The service is similar to a Mass, with the main difference being
that no one other than a priest can celebrate the Eucharist, in
which Catholics believe elements of bread and wine are consecrated
into the body and blood of Jesus. A communion service in which
hosts consecrated earlier by a priest are distributed may be
substituted in the priestless celebration.
   Retired Bishop William E. McManus, of the Diocese of Fort
Wayne-South Bend in Indiana, warned the bishops at their fall
meeting in October that approval of the rite ``will bless a monster
that could destroy the Sunday Mass tradition and Sunday Mass
obligation'' in the United States.
   But people in the dioceses involved say the services are
preferable to no Mass at all.
   ``The critical thing is we recognize we are a community,'' said
Sister Brenda Aiken, director of the Office of Pastoral
Administrators of the Catholic Diocese of Anchorage in Alaska.
   ``I think the bottom line is, yes, it is important for people to
gather,'' said Sister Marie Ann Brent, administrator of Holy Rosary
Church in Dillingham in southern Alaska.
   She said there is no difference in attendance when a priest says
Sunday Mass compared to the priestless celebrations and suggested a
priest may not necessarily provide the best kind of ministry.
   ``Maybe we work a little harder on the building of the
community,'' she said.
   Others also praised the celebrations as a way of getting lay
people more involved.
   ``I would say that even if we didn't have a shortage of priests,
there would be great value in training laypeople,'' Sheehan said.
``I see it as an opportunity to involve a greater number of people
in the ministry of the church.''
   Moscarella, who holds three services each weekend for 30 to 50
people, said the priestless celebrations are good ``because people
realize it isn't just them out there and someone on the altar, but
it should be group participation.''
   Still, the bishops said, having a priest ``who acts in the
person of Christ'' celebrate Mass remains the ideal.
   ``In the outlying communities, that's where they touch base with
the church on a once-a-week basis,'' Hayes said. ``They don't have
an experience of church other than that.''
   Why does he spend his weekend driving hundreds of miles across
two counties in Wyoming to say Mass in small, agricultural
communities like Sundance and Upton and Hulett for a total of less
than 200 people?
   ``To answer the Lord's call to take his message to the ends of
the Earth,'' Hayes said.

<TEXT>
   On ABC's ``China Beach,'' Michael Boatman's
Samuel Beckett is frequently shunned because he works among the
dead of the Vietnam War.
   Beckett is assigned to the Graves Registration Unit, where he
prepares those killed in action for return to this country.
   ``He gives people the creeps,'' said Boatman. ``People are
suspicious. They don't want to see this guy after their buddies got
killed. So, except for his close friends, people don't talk to him.
   ``He spends most of his time by himself. So, not only is he
sentenced to this horrible duty, but he's sentenced to do it
alone.''
   Beckett may be television's first mortician since Digger O'Dell
on the original ``Life of Riley'' in 1949-50. Beckett has a wry
sense of humor, but Digger was played for laughs on the comedy
series starring Jackie Gleason.
   He is not, however, the only character named after the Irish
playwright. Scott Bakula's time-traveling character on NBC's
``Quantum Leap'' is also named Sam Beckett. The only reference on
``China Beach'' to the real Beckett, who wrote ``Waiting For
Godot,'' was an episode called ``Waiting For Beckett.''
   ``The way it was explained to me, a frustrated playwright in the
Army was in charge of assigning duties,'' said Boatman. ``When a
guy named Samuel Beckett came along he thought it was amusing to
put him in Graves Registration.'' Duties of that job were to count
casualties each day, record the cause of death and make sure
personal effects were sent to the family.
   ``We take some liberties on the show. He works as a mortician
and he writes letters to the families. In reality, he wouldn't be
doing all that.''
   Beckett recently ended a relationship with a Vietnamese woman
played by Elizabeth Lindsey. At the beginning of this season, when
the writers asked the actors to suggest stories for their
characters, Boatman said he had heard of rear echelon soldiers who
suffered from ``survivor's guilt.'' They had desk jobs and felt
they were irrelevant to the war.
   ``I thought it would be interesting if Beckett goes into the
bush,'' Boatman said. ``He's suffering from `survivor's guilt' and
decides to go out. He says he's not in the action. He's in the
results. He thinks he can make a difference and keep somebody from
becoming a casualty.
   ``Beckett's going through a transition. He's still shocked and
horrified by the things he sees. He hasn't become numbed to it.
He's still shocked, but he realizes now he can make it. He's
finding ways to function. He has a perspective of the war other
people don't see or want to see. He's there with death every day.''
   Boatman can't seem to escape military connections. He was born
on an Army base in Colorado during his father's military service.
He also spent a brief time in Germany but grew up in Chicago and
its suburbs.
   His first movie was ``Hamburger Hill,'' in which he played a
soldier in Vietnam.
   ``I was a grunt in the picture,'' he said. ``It was based on a
true story about the assault on Hill 937. It was a big controversy
because hundreds of men were lost in taking the hill. Then it was
abandoned as having no tactical value.''
   Boatman had no interest in acting until high school, when he was
persuaded to try out for a school play. He was cast in one of the
leads and an acting career replaced plans to become a marine
biologist. He studied acting at Western Illinois University and
went from there directly into ``Hamburger Hill.''
   After four months of filming in the jungles of the Philippines,
he moved to New York.
   ``I did an off-Broadway play called `Something About That Face'
that had only one performance,'' he said. ``Then nothing for a
while. I handed out fliers on the street and worked as a security
guard. Working as a guard was the worst job I've ever had in my
life. I was resented because I had a college degree and had done a
movie. They knew I wouldn't stay long.''
   He's an avid collector of comic books and video animation from
Japan.
   ``I started collecting in kindergarten,'' he said. ``I've had
several collections. I lost my first in a flood. I had to sell my
second collection in college because I was desperate for money. It
was worth about $800 and I sold it for $90. The guy really took
advantage of me. Later, I was foolish enough to buy some of the
books back at his prices.''

   One of Yossi Peled's earliest memories was of
the night he was hiding in a house in Belgium when Nazi soldiers
arrived, looking for Jewish children they heard had been given
shelter.
   ``We were in the basement, and I remember the sound of their
boots,'' he recalled, banging his fist on the table to emphasize
the sound of the jackboots. ``It was the most frightening thing I
ever heard in my life.''
   Like Peled, who is now a major-general and commander of Israeli
troops along the borders with Lebanon and Syria, the Holocaust
still haunts Israelis, shadowing private lives and public
decision-making.
   Israel's extreme security-consciousness and the distrust of the
outside world, both byproducts of the Holocaust, are embodied in
politicians like right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, born
Yitzhak Ysernitzky 74 years ago in Ruzinoy, Poland.
   Shamir's father Shlomo, a Jewish community leader, escaped from
a train bound for a Nazi death camp and sought shelter in a nearby
village.
   ``While seeking shelter among friends in the village where he
grew up, they _ his friends from childhood _ killed him,'' Shamir
recalled bitterly at a remembrance ceremony this year.
   It shaped the thinking of many top military leaders, such as
Peled.
   ``I am sure that whenever a leader has to make a decision, our
background _ our terrible background _ is in his mind,'' Peled, 49,
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Peled, born Jefke Mendelevitch in Belgium, was hidden with a
Christian family in Antwerp before his parents were deported to the
Auschwitz death camp. At Auschwitz, Peled said, his father was
killed and his mother was ``destroyed as a person.''
   The Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews died, left Peled
hypersensitive about the treatment of children _ to the point where
he told friends he would have to leave their house if they could
not stop their baby's crying.
   Partly as a result of this background, Peled said he has clashed
with Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen in south Lebanon when they
have wanted to use artillery to shell civilian villages.
   ``Hundreds of times, I have put limits on operational activities
to try not to hurt innocent people and, of course, children,'' he
said.
   About 300,000 Israelis who survived the death camps and
persecution still suffer directly, and psychological studies
indicate the side effects have been passed on to a ``second
generation of victims,'' the 800,000 children of suvivors.
   Billy Laniado, head of the Second Generation Society that
represents 1,200 survivors' children, said the Holocaust still has
a pervasive influence in Israel.
   ``Even though we look strong and sometimes appear even rude, in
some ways we still feel very vulnerable,'' she said.
   In Psychologia Magazine, three army psychologists wrote in
November that based on a study of 212 soldiers who suffered shell
shock in the Lebanon war, the sons of Holocaust victims were more
susceptible to stress and took longer to recover than a control
group.
   ``The second generation was raised to correct the damage the
Holocaust caused their parents. The level of expectation increases
pressure on the battlefield but also the feeling of failure in a
soldier who breaks down and suffers from battle shock,'' wrote
Zahava Solomon, Moshe Kotler and Mario Mikulincer.
   Rabbi Menachem Fogel of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial said
in an interview the Holocaust ``is losing force, but it is still
something very vivid and potent and overwhelming in the lives of
those who lived through it.''
   The feeling that there is a real threat of annihilation even
today ``is part of our national psyche,'' he said.
   The Holocaust has deeply influenced Israeli politics, but in
different ways.
   For example, the left is constantly on guard against human
rights violations, and the right is obsessed with security.
   ``One lesson is that you learn to protect your own against any
possible threat. You also learn from the Holocaust that you cannot
persecute people because your own people's persecution has been so
traumatic,'' Fogel said.
   Yehudit Richter, a Tel Aviv University sociologist whose father
was subjected to cruel experiments by Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele,
said the outlook about what to do with the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip is entangled in the Holocaust experience.
   ``My parents feel that while we have the territories we are
strong, and they don't want to give them away,'' she said.
   But Ms. Richter and other Israelis recoil from statements by
Palestinian activists, who often liken the measures used by Israeli
soldiers fighting the Palestinian uprising to those of the Nazis.
   ``This is really enraging,'' she said. ``This (Palestinian
uprising) is not a question of existence. There is no concept of
total destruction, or wiping a people from the face of the earth.''

<HEAD>Asia Faces New Challenges in Politics and Development in 1990s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After emerging as the world's most vibrant
region in the 1980s, Asia faces the tricky task of maintaining its
double-time march toward prosperity while grappling with a
potential crisis of leadership in the new decade.
   Political stars of the 1980s, such as Deng Xiaoping in China and
Corazon Aquino in the Philippines, may soon leave the world stage
with their work in danger of unraveling.
   Other stories to watch for in the coming decade will be the
economic emergence of Vietnam, greater regional cooperation in
Asia, and the fate of Hong Kong as it switches from British to
Chinese sovereignty.
   Asia has plenty to be proud of as the 1980s draw to a close.
Japan has the world's No. 2 economy after the United States, and
the four ``little dragons'' _ South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore _ have seen dizzying export-led growth that has averaged
9 percent annually in the past generation.
   Further economic growth seems assured for Japan. A large pool of
capital for investment in factory expansion already has the United
States bracing for a new Japanese export wave.
   Much of Japan's plant and equipment investment is going into new
technology, product development and labor-saving automation,
according to Fuji Research Institute Corp., ensuring Japan will
remain highly competitive.
   But Fuji also predicts that as the United States continues to
demand Japan open its markets, ``there is a strong possibility that
the (trade) surplus will gradually shrink over the next three or
four years.''
   If that happens, the institute said, economic friction between
the two giants could focus on Japanese investment in the United
States. Sony Corp.'s takeover of Columbia Pictures and the purchase
of Rockefeller Center in New York by Mitsubishi Estate Co. already
have raised eyebrows.
   The ``little dragons'' also want continued growth but know that
their economic formula for the 1980s is outdated. Rising wages mean
that labor-intensive, low-technology factories must give way to
more advanced industry.
   In Taiwan, for example, shoe and textile plants are being
replaced by factories making computer chips and other
high-technology components.
   The region's basic manufacturing base has begun to shift toward
Southeast Asia, where a second generation of ``little dragons'' is
coming to life with cheap and plentiful labor.
   Thailand has become the region's most dynamic economy, according
to Miron Mushkat, chief regional economist for Baring Securities
Ltd. of Hong Kong. Annual growth rates are expected to continue for
at least several more years in the 5 percent to 10 percent region.
   Much of the capital fueling growth in Southeast Asia is from
cash-rich Japan and Taiwan, which have billions of dollars to burn.
   Japanese aid to Thailand, for example, was $859 million last
year, up from $48 million in 1985.
   And the Philippines is risking diplomatic trouble with China by
courting business from Beijing's political rival, Taiwan, which
invested $123 million in the first half of 1989, up one-fourth from
the same period a year earlier.
   As Southeast Asia develops, all eyes will be on Vietnam, which
could become the continent's next economic frontier. With Vietnam's
announced pullout of its troops from Cambodia, Western aid and
investment could soon pour into what has been one of the world's
most impoverished economies.
   ``Vietnam will take off in a flurry,'' once the United States
drops its trade embargo, says Robert Broadfoot, managing director
of Hong Kong-based Risk Consultancy Ltd.
   Foreign businessmen now fly into the Communist nation each day.
As a possible sign of things to come, Vietnam has emerged this year
as the world's third largest exporter of rice, after Thailand and
the United States.
   Markets for Vietnam and other expanding Asian economies will
increasingly be within the region, particularly if Europe becomes a
more difficult trade partner after the Common Market unifies in
1992.
   That has triggered talk about increased regional cooperation.
Foreign and trade ministers from 12 Pacific Rim countries,
including the United States, met in Australia in November to
discuss the issue.
   ``We now see conditions ripening for cooperation, as the
prospect of economic advance provides positive incentives for
collaboration,'' Richard H. Solomon, assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, recently told a Hong Kong
audience.
   The ministers' meeting agreed to act in concert to secure
international trade reforms but ruled out formation of an Asian
Pacific trading bloc to counter restrictions that may come from the
European market.
   Experts now envision development of a regional forum, perhaps at
the ministerial level, under which Asian nations could issue
general statements or consult with each other in times of crisis.
   Greater cooperation may not be feasible. ``Asia is very
fragmented, it lacks strong political leadership'' needed to
``sustain and galvanize a regional movement,'' explains Mushkat.
   Perhaps the greatest challenge facing Asia in the 1990s is a
potential crisis of national leadership.
   Nowhere is this more obvious than in China, where jockeying has
already begun to head the post-Deng Xiaoping era.
   Deng, 85, recently retired from his last Communist Party post
and has been trying to rally support around party chief Jiang Zemin
as his heir apparent. But Jiang's power base remains weak and it is
not clear who will rule once Deng dies.
   No matter who governs China's 1.1 billion people in the 1990s,
they will face enormous obstacles such as corruption, rising
unemployment, and lack of raw materials and energy.
   They also will have to contend with aspirations for political
change that exploded during the spring pro-democracy movement but
were crushed, at least temporarily, by the military crackdown.

<TEXT>
   The future of Deng's decade of market-oriented economic reforms,
under which China's economy staged a remarkable recovery after the
ruinous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, is particularly murky.
   ``To get rich is glorious'' was the phrase that moved the masses
in the 1980s, but it has fallen out of favor with the ascendancy
this year of ideological hard-liners.
   If conservatives such as Premier Li Peng win the power struggle,
the open-door policy would slow and more emphasis would be placed
on central planning, which would be bitterly opposed by coastal
regions that prospered greatly during Deng's reforms.
   China's uncertain future was summed up recently by U.S.
Ambassador to Beijing James Lilley, who said: ``It may be some
years before we can put a name or theme to the new chapter China
will write in the 1990s. In the meantime, we must be prepared for
twists and turns that may defy attempts'' at labeling.
   A crisis also could occur in the Philippines, a fledgling
democracy where President Corazon Aquino has said she will not seek
re-election when her term expires in 1992. No strong candidate has
emerged as her heir apparent on the politically fractured
archipelago.
   Singapore's President Lee Kuan Yew, Malaysia's Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and Indonesia's President Suharto are strong
leaders who also may leave the scene in the coming years.
   ``Every leader but one will change'' in the region, said
Broadfoot. He expects only the Sultan of Brunei to still be in
power at the turn of the century.
   One territory that is almost assured of a rough decade is Hong
Kong, which Britain will hand over to China in 1997.
   Fewer and fewer of the colony's 5.7 million people have faith in
Communist China's promise that Hong Kong can maintain its
capitalist lifestyle for 50 years and enjoy a ``high degree of
autonomy,'' particularly since the suppression of the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing.
   Huge numbers of people uncertain about the future are emigrating
from Hong Kong. A foreign passport is the most prized possession in
the colony, and residents are sparing no effort to secure one.
Marriage counselors report booming business from people desperately
seeking foreign national spouses.
   The government, in estimates often criticized as too
conservative, believes 42,000 people will emigrate in 1989 and
another 55,000 will leave the following year.
   Many highly educated white-collar workers are among those
leaving, leading to a brain drain that could reduce the territory's
economic competitiveness.
   Adding to the territory's headache are the approximately 57,000
Vietnamese boat people who have sailed to Hong Kong seeking asylum.
The squalid camps in which they are housed could erupt in violence
if the government carries through plans to send most of them back
to their homeland against their will.
   Two of the other ``little dragons'' _ Taiwan and South Korea _
show promise for furthering what Mushkat calls ``the slow and
painful process'' of democratic change in Asia, which has a long
history of authoritarian rule.
   For example, the ruling Nationalist Party is slowly giving up
its monopoly on political power in Taiwan.
   ``Democratization shall not move backward in Taiwan unless the
economy collapses or in case of a war, neither of which looks very
likely,'' said Lu Ya-li, a political commentator at National Taiwan
University.
   But Taiwan may experience some social instability because of a
problem also faced by South Korea and Japan _ a population that has
not seen its standard of living increase as quickly as national
wealth.
   Property prices have skyrocketed in Taiwan, and most
middle-class families have lost all chance of buying their own
homes. Crime has increased to the point where sales of luxury
foreign cars have fallen sharply because businessmen say the
vehicles make them targets of blackmail.
   In Japan, the average person lives in cramped housing, suffers a
long commute through congested traffic and pays prices 20 percent
to 30 percent higher than in other industrial nations.
   Says Broadfoot: ``You'll see a much greater emphasis on quality
of life in Northeast Asia'' during the 1990s.
   In Southeast Asia, the 1990s will begin with a number of thorny
security issues, including the Cambodian civil war in which the
genocidal Khmer Rouge is among several groups fighting for power.
   Washington will be negotiating the future of six U.S. military
bases on the Philippines whose lease expires in 1991. Many
influential politicians oppose the bases, and there has been some
indication of growing sentiment in the Philippines' armed forces
against the U.S. facilities.
   But perhaps the most interesting security question will be what
Tokyo does to protect its growing economic interests in the region.
   Broadfoot sees Japan likely flexing greater military strength.
``I don't think the United States will be able to continue to be
the defense umbrella of Asia to the extent that it has been,'' he
said.
   A stronger Japanese military will undoubtedly rekindle painful
memories throughout the region of Tokyo's efforts to carve a
subservient Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere during the World
War II era.
   Japan may choose to protect its investment through the use of
foreign aid designed to promote stability in the region, but that
could help create a zone of influence that also could lead to
anti-Japanese sentiment.

   ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video.
VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG)
   
   Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus von Munchausen was a German
solider and adventurer who lived in the 18th century. He also was a
master prevaricator whose tales would make Paul Bunyon's munchkin
size.
   Terry Gilliam, a founding member of the irreverent Monty Python
troupe, has taken this legendary liar and made ``The Adventures of
Baron Munchausen,'' the third in his fantasy triology that includes
``Time Bandits'' and ``Brazil.'' But where ``Time Bandits''
primarily had a comedic appeal to youngsters and ``Brazil'' tapped
more philosophical and political chords, ``Baron Munchausen'' is a
priceless romp with more visual effects and excursions into pure
fantasy than any movie in memory. There's even an unbilled cameo by
Robin Williams as the King of the Moon.
   The story opens in ``late 18th century, the Age of Reason,
Wednesday,'' with an attack on an ancient city by the ferocious
forces of the Ottoman Empire. A play about the baron is under way
at a local theater but the real baron is in the audience and takes
issue with the mockery on stage.
   The movie soon becomes the baron's story, and the spectacle is
nonstop: a hot-air trip in a balloon made of ladies' knickers that
takes the baron (John Neville) and Sally Salt (Sarah Polley), a
little girl who believes in imagination, to the moon and heaven;
heads that separate from bodies; a Venus rising from a half-shell,
complete with little angels with little wings; sea monsters;
strange trees; creatures.
   But there's so much more in Gilliam's odyssey. The film is a
wondrous and brilliant work whose underpinnings tap the very
essence of imagination and conformity. The rigid bureaucrat Horatio
Jackson (Jonathan Pryce) questions the place of fancy, imagination
and dreamers in the age of reason. There isn't one, he says.
   Fairy tales, however, never die.
   Charles McKeown, who also has the dual role of Rupert and
Adolphus, wrote the masterful screenplay with Gilliam. Eric Idle
appears as Desmond and Berthold and Oliver Reed is Vulcan.

   ``The Mighty Quinn'' (CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98)
   
   Xavier Quinn (Denzel Washington) is the island-born police chief
of a Caribbean country ruled by a puppet governor and white
American money interests. His childhood pal, Maubee (Robert
Townsend), is something of thorn in the community's side.
   Maubee also is an impish bad boy who loves living on the edge, a
Peter Pan with all the special skills of a ninja.
   Maubee is the prime suspect in the slaying of a wealthy
American. But only the governor and the Americans believe Maubee to
be the killer. Quinn's investigation is hampered by the CIA, the
governor, South American interests and the White House, but he
doggedly unravels the mystery and discovers the murderer.
   With a wonderful reggae soundtrack and the scenic beauty of Port
Antonio, Jamaica, ``The Mighty Quinn'' is a smooth and exciting
romp. There also are some great performances by Washington,
Townsend and the supporting cast.
   This is a must video to own or to rent. But if you rent it,
you'll want to take it out more than once.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for second period of November 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year, and 273 selling days so far this year,
compared with 274 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to their highest level in two
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.63 percent, up from 7.61 percent last
week. Another $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.45 percent, up from 7.40 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Nov. 13 when three-month bills
sold for 7.68 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.51 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.89 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,807.10 and 7.85 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,623.40.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.64
percent last week, down from 7.71 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   Off-price retailers are poised to take advantage
of the annual search for holiday gifts that won't bust personal
budgets.
   They say their practice of seizing opportunities to buy
attractively priced merchandise from manufacturers has enabled them
to broaden their selections, putting them in an especially strong
position to compete for customer dollars this Christmas.
   ``We have found quite an abundance of terrific merchandise in
the marketplace,'' Steven Wishner, vice president and treasurer of
retailer TJX Cos. Inc., said Monday.
   There have been more chances for them to get good buys this
autumn. In some cases, apparel suppliers that balked at shipping to
department store chains owned by financially troubled Campeau Corp.
_ worried that the cash-needy parent company would be slow in
paying _ opted to unload their goods with off-price outlets.
   ``Manufacturers are much more interested in working with the
off-pricers than ever before,'' said Jane Maxwell, a spokeswoman
for Marshalls, the nation's biggest off-price chain.
   ``When an opportunity became available, we were there to buy. We
were very well poised to take advantage of anything that did come
up,'' she said. ``When a big department store cancels an order,
we're right there to pick it up.''
   Marshalls, an Andover, Mass.-based unit of Melville Corp., and
other off-price merchants sell national brands of clothing and
designer labels at significantly smaller markups than department
stores, specialty retailers and other conventional, full-price
retailers.
   In contrast, discounters such as K mart and the Target division
of Dayton Hudson Corp. mainly carry their own private labels of
apparel or lesser-known brands, sometimes with a limited selection
of national names at reduced prices.
   The fight for market share between conventional retailers and
off-pricers always is fierce, particularly during the holiday
shopping season, which can account for more than half of a
retailer's annual profit. At the peak spending season, shoppers who
normally don't patronize off-price stores may do so in an effort to
stay within their budgets _ especially during slow economic growth.
   The battle lines have blurred lately because regular retailers
are relying heavily on price cuts to boost traffic and capitalize
on the seasonal surge in spending, a tactic industry analysts think
is a must if stores hope to woo reluctant consumers.
   ``We are expecting a restrained shopping climate to prevail in
which people will be very, very thoughtful about the way they spend
money and will look for incentives before making a purchase,'' said
retail consultant Kurt Barnard.
   Meanwhile, off-price chains are touting their expanded offerings
and their consistently lower prices in hopes of winning a larger
following.
   Marshalls has been pushing key items aggressively through
television and radio spots. Designer jogging suits, plus ladies
sweaters and silk blouses recently have been featured in Marshalls'
ads.
   Wishner said TJX has been running special advertisements to
highlight its merchandise and its T.J. Maxx stores are winding down
a 10-day promotional blitz. Besides its 337 T.J. Maxx stores,
Framingham, Mass.-based TJX owns 534 Hit or Miss women's clothing
stores and Chadwick's of Boston, a women's off-price fashion mail
order catalog.
   Rather than hurting the off-price chains, the sporadic
discounting at department stores over the past several months has
played into the hands of these retailers.
   ``It has not worked to our disadvantage,'' said Ms. Maxwell of
Marshalls. She said consumers are getting confused about what is a
fair price; by slashing prices department stores have given the
impression that their prices were too high in the first place.
   Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp., one of the country's
largest outerwear retailers that also has extensive mens, womens
and childrens clothing departments, picked up merchandise from
vendors with whom it normally didn't do much business.
   Robert LaPenta, chief financial officer of the Burlington,
N.J.-based company, said in the past suppliers waited to fill
Burlington orders until after they had satisfied department store
customers. This year, vendors have been more willing to supply
Burlington early.
   ``We were there for them,'' LaPenta said. ``We think that is
going to help us into the future. This might be the opportunity to
develop some relationships that can carry us into the '90s.''
   For this year, off-price chains hope they will have an edge over
their full-price competitors by being better stocked to meet demand.
   ``We hear that the department stores don't have the goods to do
the business through the season,'' LaPenta said. ``We definitely
have the inventory.''

<HEAD>Emigration Law Has Barred Open U.S.-Soviet Trade</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Summit-Trade, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest stumbling block to normalizing
trade between the United States and the Soviet Union has been a
15-year-old amendment added to the 1974 Trade Act.
   Sponsored by the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., and former
Rep. Charles A. Vanik, D-Ohio, the legislation prohibits Communist
countries from receiving favorable tariff treatment from the United
States unless they permit free emigration by their citizens.
   The amendment has meant that the Soviet Union cannot qualify for
most-favored-nation status, or the low tariffs that govern U.S.
trade with 150 nations. Instead, Soviet goods are taxed at rates as
much as 10 times higher than the duties paid by other countries.
   President Bush said last May that he would recommend that
Congress grant a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik requirements once the
Soviet parliament passed a liberalized emigration law and
demonstrated good faith in implementing the law.
   Such a law is pending before the Supreme Soviet and Bush is
expected to act promptly upon final passage of the measure since
the Soviets, in an effort to demonstrate good faith, have already
allowed more than 50,000 Jews to leave the country this year.
   For one product alone, the Soviets estimate that the lower
tariffs will reduce the cost of a case of vodka in the United
States by $15.

<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.Brady, who has
been plagued in recent months by arthritis, will undergo elective
surgery on Dec. 14 to replace his right hip, the Treasury
Department announced.
   The surgery, to be performed in an undisclosed location, has
been planned for a long time, said a department official who
declined to be identified. Recovery should take three to six weeks,
he said Monday.
   Deputy Secretary John Robson will serve as acting secretary,
Brady said in a memo to top department officials.
   Despite his absence until mid-January, Brady will remain in
touch with Treasury officials and take part in major decisions just
has he does when traveling outside the capital, the department
official said.
   With then-Vice President Bush's support, Brady was named
Treasury secretary in August 1988, succeeding James A. Baker III in
the final five months of the Reagan administration after Baker
resigned to head Bush's presidential campaign.
   As expected, Bush kept Brady, a close friend and political ally,
in the post after his election.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Steps Up Attack on Great Northern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. wants shareholders
of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. to vote quickly on an unsolicited,
$3.6 billion tender offer for the paper company while considering
the removal of Great Northern's directors.
   Great Northern, which has refused to negotiate with
Georgia-Pacific, promised a vigorous defense to the new attack.
   The latest round in the dispute came Monday as Georgia-Pacific
filed more papers in federal court, seeking a shareholder vote on
the buyout offer within weeks instead of months. Georgia-Pacific
also announced it would run advertisements asking shareholders to
demand a special meeting at which the Great Northern executives
could be ousted.
   ``It's clearly time to let Great Northern's shareholders speak
for themselves, since their board obviously does not speak for
them,'' Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said in a
statement released by his Atlanta headquarters.
   In papers filed in U.S. District Court, Georgia-Pacific asked
for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that
would force a Great Northern shareholder meeting to be moved up
from March 20 to sometime within the next 30 days for a vote on the
tender offer.
   Georgia-Pacific also seeks to force Great Northern to disclose
to the Securities and Exchange Commission any steps it might be
taking to alter its financial structure to make a takeover more
difficult.
   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., but incorporated in
Maine, called Georgia-Pacific's motion ``entirely meritless'' and
``an effort to divert attention from the illegal and ill-conceived
nature of Georgia-Pacific's takeover effort.''
   ``In essence, Georgia-Pacific is asking the court to give
shareowners less time to consider the merits of each side's
position,'' Great Northern spokesman Stephen M. Hill said in a
statement.
   Great Northern has refused to negotiate with Georgia-Pacific
since it made a tender offer of $58 per share last month, then
raised the offer to $63 per share this month. Great Northern said
the offer would not be good for shareholders and that it would
violate antitrust laws.
   Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith said that under Maine
law, if at least one-third of the shareholders request a special
meeting for voting on removal of the directors, the meeting must be
called within 60 days.
   Hill said his company had not seen a copy of Georgia-Pacific's
request for any such meeting, and so he had no immediate comment.
   Hahn was to meet in Augusta today with Gov. John R. McKernan and
Attorney General James E. Tierney in separate sessions.
   Maine officials have sought assurances from both companies that
any merger would not cost any state residents their jobs or put
valuable woodlands in the hands of developers.
   Hahn has balked at making any promises, saying that since he
does not have access to Great Northern's inside information on its
Maine holdings, he cannot say for sure what Georgia-Pacific will do
if it wins the takeover battle.

<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car and light truck sales remained weak in
mid-November, down 4.4 percent compared with the same time last
year, making extended manufacturing layoffs around Christmas a
growing possibility, analysts said.
   The eight major automakers with U.S. assembly plants said Monday
they sold vehicles at an average rate of 31,032 a day during the
Nov. 11-20 period this year compared with a daily pace of 32,466
vehicles during the same time last year.
   Car sales slumped 6.1 percent and light truck sales declined 1.8
percent for the period.
   The decline may seem small compared with some double-digit
tumbles a few weeks ago, but a large percentage of the cars being
sold now are going to fleets such as rental car companies and large
corporations, said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in
New York.
   ``About 40 percent (of the sales) in the first 50 days of a
model year are fleet sales,'' Kirnan said. ``It basically means
that the individual has not been in the market.
   ``Come the first quarter (of 1990) we'll have a better sense of
whether the market is really as weak as we may be seeing now,'' he
said.
   Between now and then, automakers are likely to shy away from
large-scale increases in their incentive programs, opting instead
for longer Christmas and New Year holiday shutdowns to help control
new car inventories, analysts said.
   ``I think they are finding the incentives didn't work, so they
are cutting back production,'' said analyst Mary Anne Sudol of
Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York.
   During the first nine months of this year, automakers shuffled
incentive packages at a nearly dizzying pace. But by the time the
1990 models began appearing in showrooms in October, many of the
incentive packages had been trimmed for the new cars.
   Contributing to the sales decline were higher prices for the
1990 models due in large part, the companies said, to such
government-mandated safety devices as driver-side air bags and
automatic seat belts.
   The double wallop of higher prices and lower incentives pushed
consumers into buying 1989 models in August and September, analysts
and company officials have said.
   The sales numbers reported Monday were not surprising, Kirnan
said.
   ``The industry has anticipated the weakness in the present
quarter because of what happened in the summer, the big blowout
sales and consumers taking advantage of the pricing on the '89
models,'' he said.
   Through Nov. 20, car and truck sales from manufacturers with
U.S. plants were 2.6 percent behind last year's pace. Car sales
were down 3.6 percent and truck sales were off 0.8 percent.
   Ford Motor Co. said sales of its vehicles were down 13 percent
in mid-November, with car sales falling 11.6 percent and truck
sales off 14.8 percent. For the year, Ford's vehicle sales were
down 2.5 percent.
   Chrysler Corp.'s cars and trucks sold at a pace 3.3 percent
slower in mid-November this year compared with the same time last
year. A 12 percent drop in its car sales was offset by a 6 percent
increase in its light truck sales.
   Chrysler's year-to-date car and truck sales were 6.4 percent
behind last year.
   General Motors Corp. said its mid-November car sales were down
13 percent while its truck sales were up 4.1 percent, combining for
a 7.3 percent decline for its vehicles during the period. For the
year, GM's car and truck sales were down 5 percent from last year.

<HEAD>European Community Signs Trade Accord with Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission says
it has signed a trade and economic cooperation accord with the
Soviet Union that goes beyond similar deals signed in the past 14
months with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   The pact provides for a gradual lifting of import quotas on
Soviet industrial goods by 1995 and cites a dozen areas in which
the two sides plan to establish economic cooperation, an EC source
said Monday.
   These include science and technology, banking, transport,
agriculture, environmental protection, energy, raw materials and
mining. The accord excludes trade in goods considered to be
sensitive militarily, according to the source, who asked not to be
identified.
   He said the agreement calls for reciprocity in trade benefits.
``That is the objective of this accord ... to get an effective
access to the Russian market for EC products,'' the source said.
   Officials could not give an assessment of the economic impact of
the agreement.
   EC trade with Eastern Europe is small. It totaled $56 billion in
1987, the last year for which complete figures are available.
EC-Soviet trade that year was only $24.6 billion.
   The agreement with Moscow was reached after five days of talks
between EC Commission and Soviet negotiators. It must be approved
by the 12 EC states and the European Parliament.
   That is a formality, however, given the EC's interest in
increasing economic links with Eastern Europe and getting access to
its market of 390 million consumers.
   The Soviet accord, negotiated in about four months, is the
fourth the EC has signed with an East European nation in just over
a year.
   It signed a trade and economic cooperation agreement with
Hungary in September 1988; a more limited deal with Czechoslovakia
covering only trade in manufactured goods was signed in December
1988; and an agreement with Poland was signed Sept. 19.
   These accords follow a June 25, 1988, agreement under which the
EC and the Moscow-led Comecon trade bloc, after years of ignoring
one another, signed a mutual recognition agreement in Luxembourg.
   The EC on Monday also widened market access for farm and textile
goods from Poland and Hungary. Through the measure, which will be
in effect only during 1990, the EC suspended import quotas for the
two countries that are fixed through the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body.
   In a statement, the 12 EC foreign ministers said the one-year
lifting of quotas was an ``exceptional solution to an exceptional
problem'' and represents no change in the EC's overall position on
quotas in world trade.
   The move follows an EC decision Nov. 6 to increase market access
for industrial goods from Poland and Hungary.
   The EC foreign ministers were notified of the agreement with the
Soviet Union but did not discuss the issue in depth.
   The Soviet accord goes further than any other deal the EC has
signed with an East European nation, notably by subjecting nuclear
energy safety and mining to economic cooperation, sources said.
   Also on Monday, European Community External Relations
Commissioner Frans Andriessen called developments in Czechoslovakia
of the last week ``a cause for profound rejoicing throughout
Europe.''
   ``Political reform and economic liberalization in Czechoslovakia
fom part of a wider process which, for the first time in more than
40 years, offers to future generations the prospect of a Europe no
longer riven by division,'' he said.
   EC officials said it was too early to speak of a widening of the
accord with Czechoslovakia.
   The Commission is still negotiating trade and economic
cooperation agreements with Bulgaria and East Germany. Talks with
East Germany are in an ``exploratory'' stage but will likely be
speeded up by next week's visit to East Berlin by Andriessen.
   East Germany has asked the EC for an accord on trade and
economic cooperation. The EC has broken off talks for closer
economic ties with Romania in view of its human rights record.

   The biggest single revenue-raiser in the new
deficit reduction agreement will sharply limit employers' ability
to use taxes withheld from workers' checks before turning the money
over to the Treasury.
   The legislation on President Bush's desk would reduce to one day
_ from as many as seven days _ the grace period allowed before
large employers have to deposit withheld taxes.
   Congressional economists estimate the change, which takes effect
Aug. 1, would save the government $2.45 billion in the last two
months of the budget year ending Sept. 30. That's more than twice
the size of the next-largest revenue increase in the bill.
   Two far smaller parts of the bill also rely on accelerating tax
collections. One affects the airline industry, which collects the 8
percent tax on passenger tickets; the other requires gasoline
wholesalers to make quicker payments of the 9.1-cent-a-gallon
gasoline tax.
   ``The idea is that somebody is collecting a tax for the
government and the issue is how quickly they should deposit it into
the federal coffers,'' said Sam Starr, a partner in the Washington
office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountants.
   The payroll-tax change will affect only those employers that
have collected more than $100,000 of Social Security and income
taxes in a given period.
   ``That's not going to hit the Mom-and-Pop operations,'' Starr
said. ``Perhaps those with 100 or 200 employees may be affected.''
   David Burton, a tax specialist with the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, sees the change becoming a burden for medium and larger
companies, especially those that have more than one plant or outlet.
   ``Obviously they will be denied a small float,'' the temporary
use of withheld taxes, Burton said. ``But the problem comes because
they will be forced to make deposits before they can calculate how
much they really owe.''
   Burton said many companies with multiple outlets will have to
make the federal tax deposit a day or two before they can collect
records of how many hours were worked during the pay period or
exactly how many people were on the payroll.
   Under present law, a month is divided into eight deposit periods
of three or four days each. In general, an employer has three
banking days to make a deposit if at the end of any of those
periods the company has undeposited taxes of $3,000 or more.
   Under the bill, an employer would have to make a deposit the
next banking day _ regardless of where that fell in the eight
deposit periods _ after collected taxes totaled more than $100,000.
   The bill applies to income taxes and Social Security taxes
withheld from workers' checks, as well as to an employer's matching
share of Social Security taxes.
   A company with 200 workers averaging $20,000 a year would not be
affected by the new rule. However, one with 250 employees at the
same average would be hit, assuming the workers had income taxes
withheld at a 15 percent rate. The combined employer-employee
Social Security tax rate next year will be 15.3 percent.
   Burton sees this year's legislation as ``the nose under the
tent.'' The next time Congress is looking for a painless
revenue-raiser, he predicts, the lawmakers will cut the $100,000
threshold, ``and eventually it's going to get down to the really
small employer.''

<HEAD>As Summit Nears, US, Soviets Ready to Normalize Trade Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union are on
the verge of reviving normal trade relations as their leaders meet
in this weekend's summit, though it could be years before trading
practices catch up with the political changes sweeping the
communist bloc.
   Trade between the two superpowers will be a primary topic of
discussion at the Mediterranean shipboard summit meeting between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   For its part, the administration hopes that strengthening
U.S.-Soviet trade ties will provide American support for
Gorbachev's economic restructuring, known as perestroika.
   There is no doubt that the Soviet economy and Gorbachev's
restructuring efforts are in need of a boost. With winter
approaching, the Soviets are plagued by strikes and severe
shortages of many consumer items.
   So far, Bush has stopped far short of any bold package of
measures aimed at promoting extensive East-West economic links,
although the administration has given endorsement to Gorbachev's
economic reforms and offered U.S. economists to supply technical
assistance to the Soviets.
   One announcement Bush is expected to make at the summit or soon
after is a proposed waiver of the high tariffs that have been
imposed on imports of Soviet goods into the United States for the
past 15 years.
   Those tariffs, which carry duties as much as 10 times higher
than on imports from other countries, are a result of legislation
passed by Congress in 1974 known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment.
   That law says communist countries may not receive favorable
tariff treatment from the United States unless they permit free
emigration of their citizens.
   Last May, Bush announced that he would ask Congress to remove
the Soviet Union from the Jackson-Vanik restriction if the Soviet
Union liberalized its emigration policies.
   The Supreme Soviet is debating legislation that would
essentially put into law what has already been occurring in the
Soviet Union. More than 50,000 Jews have left the country this year.
   The Soviets hope that removal of the tariffs will make their
products more attractive to American consumers. But Bush
administration officials caution against expecting too much in the
way of expanded trade, at least in the near term.
   ``It will be up to their private sector to create tradable
items,'' U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said in an
interview. ``They have a number of items that are tradable on the
world market. A lot of them come out of the ground, oil and ores.''
   However, just last week the Soviet government, faced with
serious shortages, announced new restrictions on exports of goods
in short supply at home. Because of the problems the Soviets are
facing producing enough for domestic consumption, U.S. economists
question how much production they can divert to exports.
   But economists do see trade opportunities for the West in
supplying products to Soviet consumers, many of whom have won hefty
wage increases under perestroika but have little chance to spend
their extra rubles in depleted stores.
   The Soviet government, trying to quell consumer unhappiness, has
spent $16 billion this year on emergency imports of such everyday
items as razor blades and shaving cream.
   ``You are looking at a potentially huge market,'' said Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who led the U.S. delegation during
November trade negotiations with the Soviets.
   The Soviet Union is one of a handful of countries with which the
United States enjoys a trade surplus. Through September this year,
U.S. export sales to the Soviet Union, primarily agricultural
products, amounted to $3.22 billion while Soviet sales to America
have totaled $555 million, giving the United States a surplus in
the two-way trade of $2.66 billion.
   The prospect of expanded trade with the Soviets is exciting to
American farm groups in particular. Before President Carter imposed
a grain embargo in retaliation for the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, America supplied almost 80 percent of Soviet grain
imports. A new long-term grain agreement is being negotiated.
   The Soviet Union has been promoting Western joint ventures as a
key part of Gorbachev's efforts to attract foreign investment to
modernize Soviet industry.
   Since January 1987, more than 1,000 agreements with Western
companies have been signed, but so far only about 10 percent have
been implemented.
   Theodore Cooper, head of Upjohn, the giant pharmaceutical
company, said his company is already doing research in the Soviet
Union and is exploring the possibility of a joint venture to
manufacture drugs there. But Cooper said there are many hurdles to
overcome, including the fact that the Soviet ruble is not easily
convertible to other currencies.
   ``Getting your money out is always a challenge and the
instabilities and the uncertainties have always made the
opportunities seem difficult,'' he said.
   The Bush administration has working groups exploring a proposed
new trade treaty with the Soviet Union to replace one that Moscow
nullified in 1975 after the Jackson-Vanik tariff hikes went into
effect.
   The working groups are also exploring such issues as investments
and tax treatment for U.S. companies doing business in the Soviet
Union.
   The administration has already said that Moscow will not be
getting some items on its wish list. Mosbacher said the
administration was not in favor of granting admission at this time
for the Soviets in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
governing body for world trade.
   The U.S. government has also been cool to lowering barriers to
trade in high-technology items which could be used for military
purposes, though the administration is receiving heavy pressure
from its West European allies to ease that stance.

<HEAD>Department Store Chain to Sell All Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The end of the line may be near for the
104-year-old Miller &amp; Rhoads department store chain, which has
abandoned a plan to reorganize under bankruptcy law and says it
wants to sell all its assets.
   ``If Miller &amp; Rhoads cannot continue as a viable retail entity,
then it's best that this action be taken,'' President John E.
Stokely told a news conference Monday at the company's flagship
store in downtown Richmond.
   Stokely said the Richmond-based chain had filed a plan earlier
in the afternoon in U.S. Bankruptcy Court that ``contemplates the
sale of all assets.''
   Miller &amp; Rhoads had 14 stores in July when it filed for
protection from its creditors to enable it to reorganize under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy code. The company has since begun
arrangements to rid itself of six of its less profitable stores.
   The company's ``current circumstances and financial condition
led the board of directors to conclude that a reorganization as a
profitable going concern is not feasible,'' Stokely said.
   He said negotiations are continuing to sell four of the eight
remaining outlets to May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis. May,
which operates 14 department store chains around the country, is
interested in Miller &amp; Rhoads stores at Lynnhaven Mall in Virginia
Beach, Greenbrier Mall in Chesapeake, and Chesterfield and Regency
malls in suburban Richmond, he said.
   ``The nature of these negotiations is such that they could be
consummated tomorrow, next week ... or never,'' he said.
   Hecht's, a department store chain owned by May, planned to hold
a news conference today in Washington, but Stokely said he did not
know if the subject would involve a possible purchase of Miller &amp;
Rhoads stores.
   Stokely estimated it would take four to six months to complete
the sale of all Miller &amp; Rhoads assets, and said none of the sales
transactions would be completed before the end of January.
   The chain will operate normally through the Christmas season,
Stokely said.
   ``All customer services will remain intact, including
after-Christmas returns and refunds,'' he said.
   Stokely said factors affecting Miller &amp; Rhoads' decision to sell
its assets included a weakness in the retail industry, inventory
levels, financing and the company's debt level.
   ``I'm disappointed. Certainly, everybody in the company is
disappointed,'' he said.
   He said jobs should be available to the majority of the
company's approximately 2,000 employees through the sale of the
chain's properties to other retailers.

<HEAD>Women Workers Laid Off As Factories Cut Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women are being laid off and poorly treated under
current state efforts to streamline workforces in factories,
according to a survey by the China Women's Journal.
   The survey of northeast China's Liaoning province found that
many women are being laid off by factories that consider them
surplus or redundant, the journal said in a report carried by the
official China Daily on Tuesday.
   It said women were the victims of ``optimum reorganization'' of
the labor force, China's euphemism for laying off workers.
   Very few people are ever fired in the nation's state-run
enterprises and laid-off workers usually receive their base pay.
However, only 4.5 percent of laid-off women continue to get
bonuses, a substantial part of incomes, and welfare benefits.
   A investigation made earlier this year by the All-China National
labor Force Commission found that enterprises considered 20 percent
of their employees to be surplus or redundant, and 64 percent of
them were women. Women make up about 37 percent of the urban
workforce.
   Many enterprises are also now refusing to hire women because
maternity leaves and early retirements drive up welfare costs.

<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp.'s creation of a leveraged
employee stock ownership plan will likely decrease the chances of a
takeover of the oil giant, analysts say.
   ``It improves the company's defenses,'' said Rosario Ilacqua, an
analyst with New York-based Nikko Securities. ``In a real showdown
with someone they (employees) will vote for their management rather
than with someone from without. People are afraid they will lose
their jobs.''
   The announcement of the ESOP plan on Monday follows weeks of
speculation that Chevron is ripe for takeover, possibly by Pennzoil
Co.
   But a spokesman for Chevron, the world's sixth largest oil
company and the nation's largest petroleum refiner, denied the move
was intended to thwart a possible takeover.
   ``We did not do this as a defensive measure. We have been
examining the feasibility of an ESOP since April when we created a
task force to look into it,'' said spokesman Larry Shushan. He
declined to comment on takeover rumors.
   He said the program was created as a low-cost means of paying
for part of employee benefits.
   Shushan said the company had put the idea on hold until Congress
last week passed legislation preserving the tax deduction on
dividends paid by a corporation on shares held by such a plan.
   The plan will eventually place 16 percent of the oil company's
stock in the ownership of its employees. It envisions an employee
trust spending $1 billion to add about 5 percent of Chevron's 342
million shares to the 11 percent already held by the company's
profit-sharing plan.
   Under the ESOP, which will be part of Chevron's Profit
Sharing-Savings Plan, the company will sell stock to its employees
and then buy a comparable amount on the open market. Chevron's
Profit Sharing plan holds about 11 percent of the company's
outstanding stock.
   The ESOP trust will borrow $1 billion from banks and use the
money to buy newly issued shares of Chevron common stock from the
corporation.
   The new shares, which are about 5 percent of Chevron's 342
million outstanding shares, will be held by the leveraged ESOP
Trust, the company said. They will be allocated to employee
accounts in May when Chevron makes its profit sharing distribution
for the first quarter of 1990, to non-union employees. The plan
will be offered to union workers through the collective bargaining
process, Shushan said.
   Chevron's stock closed Monday at 68\ per share on the New York
Stock Exchange, up 3\. The stock has sold as high as 69 in recent
weeks.
   Analysts said the rise in Chevron stock since takeover
speculation began is not surprising since the stock has been
undervalued in recent years. Chevron's stock has risen about 48
percent this year.
   Chevron, rich in oil and gas reserves and a high-performing
chemicals unit, had sales in 1988 of $28.9 billion, down from $29.1
billion in 1987. Earnings last year totaled $1.8 billion, or $5.17
a share, up about 40 percent from $1.3 billion, or $3.65 a share.
   Some analysts say that in a breakup, Chevron's assets could be
worth $100 to $125 a share - or about $40 billion.
   A published report Monday suggested that a group of investors
could be acting in concert to force Chevron into a restructuring
that would boost the stock further.
   A buyer, possibly a company acting alone or with partners, has
reportedly accumulated 12 million to 16 million shares of Chevron
stock, or 3.5 percent to 4.7 percent, according to USA Today.
Shushan declined to comment on the stock's purchaser, in accordance
with company policy.
   Pennzoil also declined to comment, but the Houston-based oil
company is rumored to be looking for a place to park some $2.5
billion in cash that it received in a 1988 settlement with Texaco
Inc. following a prolonged battle over Getty Oil Co.

   OPEC ministers said today they reached a new
production agreement that would raise the group's output ceiling to
22 million barrels a day and maintain a target price of $18 a
barrel.
   All 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would sign the agreement at its Vienna secretariat later
in the day, ministers said, as they broke up a main bargaining
session in a hotel.
   How the increase would be allocated wasn't immediately known.
The cartel likely would issue a communique after the agreement was
signed.
   OPEC's daily ceiling for the fourth quarter is 20.5 million
barrels, but analysts say it is producing more than 23 million
barrels, with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates cheating on their
quotas.
   Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh confirmed a deal was
reached and that the new ceiling would be 22 million barrels a day.
   Venezuelan minister Celestino Armas confirmed that all the
members agreed to the pact.
   Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister nodded yes when asked
if the target price would be $18 a barrel, its current level.
   The ministers overcame their differences on the fourth day of
their regular winter conference to reach an agreement for the first
half of 1990.
   They had struggled with demands from Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates for bigger portions of the production.
   It was doubtful the United Arab Emirates would abide by any
quota agreed to Tuesday. It and Kuwait have been producing 2
million barrels a day each, or double their current quotas.
   Earlier, sources, who demanded anonymity, said the tentative
plan was for Indonesia and Venezuela to relinquish portions of
their shares so that Kuwait could get the bigger percentage it
wants.
   The United Arab Emirates perhaps would be allowed to produce
what it wants, sources said. The other members would get to pump
more oil but their shares of the total would remain the same, they
said.
   Libya and Algeria, in particular, had balked at the plan sources
said.
   Speaking of the sources' outline, Steve Turner, an oil analyst
with the London investment firm Smith New Court, said, ``I think
it's a very weak agreement.''
   Such a deal would result in OPEC allowing production of around
24 million barrels a day, more than it is producing in violation of
its current ceiling.
   Turner estimates demand of 21.5 million barrels a day in the
first have of 1990.
   ``So it look as though OPEC is going to be producing
substantially in excess of the market's needs,'' Turner said. ``In
that scenario the oil price would be under continued downward
pressure.''
   Recently, oil prices have been surprisingly strong in face of
overproduction by OPEC, and are trading at levels 50 percent above
a year ago.
   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, was trading at a spot price of $18.25 a barrel Tuesday,
down 20 cents from late Monday.

   The International Wheat Council on Tuesday raised
its 1989-1990 estimate of world grain production to 1.346 billion
tons, up 4 million tons from last month's forecast of 1.342 billion.
   This would be well above last season's poor drought-hit harvest
of 1.231 billion tons, but still below estimated world consumption,
the council said.
   The council raised its figure for 1989-90 world production of
coarse grain, principally corn, to 816 million tons from 812
million forecast last month. Estimated 1988-89 output was 729
million tons.
   The estimated 1989-90 world wheat production was unchanged at
530 million tons, compared with 502 million last season.
   The council is sticking to its estimate of a 1989-90 Soviet
grain harvest of 205 million tons, compared with 195 million in
1989-90.
   It raised its projection of Soviet 1989-90 grain imports to 33
million tons compared with 31 million tons forecast last month and
estimated 1988-89 imports of 39 million tons.
   Soviet wheat imports are put at 11 million tons vs. 15 million
last season, and coarse grain at 20 million tons vs. 24 million
tons.

   Bond sales that cost customers of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association more than $250 million ``flagrantly''
violated securities rules, the chairman of the House Banking
Committee says.
   The bonds, issued by Lincoln's Phoenix, Ariz.-based parent
company, American Continental Corp., are considered worthless. They
were sold to 22,000 buyers, many of them elderly pensioners who
invested their life savings.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, whose panel is investigating
the collapse of Lincoln, headquartered in Irvine, Calif., said in a
news release Monday that bond salespeople were paid bonuses of up
to $300 a month.
   ``These bonuses appear to be a flagrant violation of (Securities
and Exchange Commission) regulations, and they directly contradict
a statement in the (American Continental) prospectus,'' Gonzalez
said.
   An attorney representing American Continental had not seen the
committee's latest accusations and had no immediate comment on them
Monday.
   Regulators, who seized Lincoln in April, estimate the failure
will cost taxpayers $2 billion, making it the costliest S&amp;L
collapse in the nation's history. Lincoln depositors were protected
by federal insurance, but customers who bought American Continental
subordinated debt from salespeople in Lincoln branch lobbies were
not.
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
added his voice to those calling for the resignation of M. Danny
Wall, the top regulator of the S&amp;L industry.
   ``Everyone will be better served by a clean break and new
leadership,'' Mitchell said at a luncheon with reporters on Monday.
He said he does not know Wall or necessarily blame him for the
industry's problems. Others have accused Wall, director of the
Office of Thrift Supervision, of having evidence of irregularities
at Lincoln two years before it was shut down.
   In a hearing before the banking committee earlier this month,
bondholders testified they either were led to believe or were
explicitly told the debt was similar to a federally insured
certificate of deposit.
   Gonzalez based his allegation that securities regulations were
violated partly on a July 26 memo written by Dariush Razavi, a
senior vice president at Lincoln, to Mark Randall, the government
agent supervising the S&amp;L.
   Razavi said bond salespeople received ``incentive'' payments up
to $300 a month ``for achieving sales goals.''
   ``With the offer of hundreds of dollars per month in the
prohibited bonuses dangling before their eyes, it's no wonder the
employees were lured into steering Lincoln customers away from
their safe insured deposits to the high-risk bonds,'' Gonzalez said.
   Another senior Lincoln official, who committee aides declined to
identify by name, told the committee that memoranda announcing the
bonuses were destroyed in an attempt to cover up the violations,
Gonzalez said.
   The Arizona Republic in today's editions quoted three former
Lincoln employees involved with the bond sales as saying the
bonuses ranged up to $500.
   ``We did a lot more than we were supposed to,'' said Bryan
Grossman, identified by the Republic as a 25-year-old former
Lincoln financial representative in west Los Angeles.
   The newspaper did not identify the other two former employees
but reported they said the bond-sales goals were part of an overall
``customer service'' program.
   Razavi said bond salespeople were on average 22 years old,
earned $20,000 a year and were ``young, impressionable'' and eager
to further their careers.
   Although bond salespeople were paid by American Continental,
they easily transferred back and forth between the payroll of the
S&amp;L and its holding company, he said.
   ``Seventy-seven percent of the current employees of Lincoln
Savings were directly involved with the bond program,'' Razavi said.
   He said salespeople sincerely believed they were promoting
worthwhile investments and noted that they sold $1.07 million of
the bonds to themselves or family members.
   Gonzalez also said that $13 million of the debt sales came late
in 1986, before American Continental had obtained the necessary
permission from California regulators.
   The banking committee held six hearings this fall exploring why
regulators delayed closing Lincoln. The Senate Ethics Committee has
hired an independent counsel to examine charges that five senators
_ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.,; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz. _
improperly intervened with regulators on Lincoln's behalf.

<HEAD>Braniff Wants to Extend $3 Million Payment Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc., unable to meet a bankruptcy
judge's deadline to pay $3 million to an aviation company for five
leased jets, blamed it on a legal dispute that left little time to
obtain financing.
   Braniff is exploring ways to get the midnight Monday payment
deadline extended, said company spokeswoman Ann Cook.
   Lawyers and U.S. officials for GPA Group Ltd., an Irish leasing
company, would not comment Monday.
   Braniff is behind in other bills, including $1.6 million owed to
Kansas City International Airport, Cook said. A meeting of
Braniff's creditors is scheduled for today in Orlando.
   Orlando-based Braniff filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on Sept. 28, its second
such filing in seven years. The airline stopped flying Nov. 7 when
it laid off most of its remaining employees.
   Braniff, once an employer of more than 4,800, now has about 275
workers and is trying to continue as a charter carrier.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge C. Timothy Corcoran said Saturday that GPA
could sue Braniff to get the five aircraft back if the airline did
not meet the deadline. Braniff took delivery of the planes before
filing for bankruptcy.
   Corcoran's decision came after a five-day trial in a lawsuit
brought by Braniff against GPA. Braniff claimed breach of contract
when GPA canceled a lease agreement for 50 Airbus A320 jets a few
hours before Braniff filed for bankruptcy.
   ``In large measure, we have been prevented from obtaining the
financing for Monday's payment because of the litigation with
GPA,'' Cook said. ``Once the dispute involving the contracts was
cleared up, we had only two days to come up with financing. We're
working on this.''
   The airline's most valuable asset, its lease and purchase
agreements for the 50 jets, could not be subleased or sold until
Corcoran's ruling that the contracts for the Airbuses are valid.
   GPA and other defendants in the lawsuit are parties in several
complex agreements designed to enable Braniff to lease 26 Airbuses
from GPA, buy 24 from Avsa SARL and finance the transaction.
Braniff also had an option to buy another 50 Airbuses.
   American Airlines has discussed the possibility of acquiring the
Airbuses from Braniff.

   The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press reached a
tentative agreement with five unions today, ending the threat of a
strike that could have disrupted the start of their joint operating
agreement.
   ``We're delighted we have a settlement,'' said Robert Giles,
president and publisher of The News. ``We expected to able to work
it out on an amicable basis, and we did.''
   ``Now we can go full speed ahead,'' said Robert J. Hall,
publisher and chairman of the Free Press.
   The agreement was reached about 6:45 a.m. EST in a negotiating
session that began about late evening Monday.
   Joe Fundaro, interim secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 372,
which represents 1,100 workers in the merged circulation department
serving the two newspapers, said ratification meetings for union
members would be scheduled Sunday.
   ``It's the best that the unions felt they could achieve,'' said
Lou Mleczko, president of the Newspaper Guild Local 22,
representing about 900 editorial employees at the papers. ``We went
along with the recommendation of the Teamsters.''
   Terms of the tentative contract were not immediately released,
but The Detroit News quoted a union source today as saying the
two-year agreement would provide raises totaling $80 a week, plus
two-week bonuses.
   The unions sought raises totaling $110 weekly during a 2{-year
contract plus a three-week pay bonus, said Lou Mleczko, president
of the Newspaper Guild Local 22, representing editorial employees
at the papers.
   The average weekly salary of all workers at the two papers,
excluding benefits, is about $570, Hall said.
   Many employees have had only one raise since 1986, when News
owner Gannett Co. and Free Press owner Knight-Ridder Inc. announced
plans for a joint operating agreement.
   The unions had set a 12:01 a.m. Thursday strike deadline,
averting a walkout that could have delayed the long-stalled partial
merger between the nation's ninth- and tenth-largest newspapers.
   The joint operating agreement sought since 1986 began on
schedule Monday.
   The papers merged business, advertising, production and
circulation operations to cut costs, while retaining separate news
and editorial departments.
   The Free Press remains a morning newspaper, while the News will
generally have afternoon home deliveries. Weekend editions will be
jointly produced under the masthead of The Detroit News and Free
Press.
   The daily circulation of the News is 690,422 and 832,382 on
Sundays, and the Free Press' is 626,434 daily and 687,537 Sundays.
   The JOA's path was cleared of legal challenges from a coalition
of readers and advertisers when the U.S. Supreme Court tied 4-4 on
Nov. 13. The tie let stand lower court rulings that approved the
100-year deal.
   The Free Press, which lost millions of dollars in the past 10
years, was described as in danger of failing without the JOA. The
two papers say they have lost about $200 million in the past decade.

   The Supreme Court, in a dispute stemming from
the 1981 settlement of the Iran hostage crisis, ruled today that
American companies recovering money from Iran must pay a portion to
the U.S. government.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices upheld a 1985 law requiring
companies that win claims against Iran before a special
international tribunal to pay 1.5 percent of the first $5 million
recovered and 1 percent of the excess to the U.S. government.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said the money
paid to the federal treasury is a reasonable ``user fee'' intended
to reimburse the government for its costs. Also, he said, United
States participation in the international tribunal assures the
companies they will collect money owed them by Iran.
   White rejected arguments by Sperry Corp. that forcing companies
to pay the fees is an unconstitutional confiscation of their
property and that any costs to the government should be borne by
the nation as a whole.
   ``As we see it, Sperry has not identified any of its property
that was taken without just compensation,'' he said.
   The Bush administration said tens of millions of dollars were at
stake, including some $12.7 million already deducted by the U.S.
government from claims paid to companies.
   The financial deal that freed the 52 American hostages from Iran
included the release by the U.S. government of billions of dollars
in frozen Iranian assets. Also, the settlement set up a process
permitting those with claims against Iran to take them to an
international tribunal.
   The Supreme Court in 1981 upheld the power of former President
Jimmy Carter to approve the settlement, and that was not at issue
in today's ruling.
   Sperry Corp., which leased computer systems to Iran before the
1979 hostage crisis severed relations between the United States and
that country, was awarded $2.8 million by the tribunal set up to
handle claims after the hostages were freed.
   Sperry was ordered to pay the U.S. government $42,000 for what
the government said was U.S. expenses in helping resolve the
company's claim against Iran.
   A federal appeals court here ruled in 1988 that the fee is an
unconstitutional seizure of private property by the government.
   In overruling the appeals court, White said, ``This court has
never held that the amount of a user fee must be precisely
calibrated to the use that a party makes of government services.
Nor does the government need to record invoices and billable hours
to justify the costs of its services.''
   Today's ruling is not related directly to recent developments
suggesting easing of tensions between Iran and the United States.
   The Bush administration announced three weeks ago that the
United States is returning $567 million in frozen assets to Iran, a
move Prsident Bush said he hopes will prompt Tehran to push for
freedom for American hostages in Lebanon.
   The $567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by
American banks against Iran.
   The case is U.S. vs. Sperry Corp., 88-952.
   Meanwhile, in an unrelated case, the court ruled by a 9-0 vote
that a federal law aimed primarily at compensating injured
dockworkers also applies to railroad employees who clean and repair
dockside locading equipment.
   It ruled that three injured railroad workers from Virginia are
limited to receiving benefits under the Longshoremen's and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act. They had sought potentially greater
compensation under a disability law covering the railroad industry,
the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said the workers
were covered by the longshoremens act because their jobs were
``essential to the loading process.''

   The stock market rebounded in moderately active
trading today after early weakness as players continued to sort out
the prospects for lower interest rates.
   At noon EST, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.54
points at 2,700.51. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indicator was up
2.98 points.
   Philip Puccio, senior vice president at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the 2,700 mark on the Dow Jones Industrials
could prove to be an important psychological resistance level.
   ``If the Dow can break through 2,700, it will bring in some
buying,'' Puccio said shortly before the blue-chip indicator
penetrated 2,700.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 4 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 724 issues up, 568 down and 543
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 75.26 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts said market players continued to debate the
Federal Reserve's next move after the central bank surprised many
observers on Monday by draining reserves from the banking system.
The Fed action pushed short-term interest rates higher, dashing
widely held beliefs that it was easing credit.
   Nevertheless, investors remained generally optimistic that
interest rates are in an overall declining pattern, analysts said.
   ``Over the next couple months the perception is that rates have
to come down so there's no reason to get excited about short-term
action by the Fed,'' said Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Foreign investors also were helping keep stock prices firm,
Puccio said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.44 to 191.57.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
gained 0.14 to 374.18.

   Jack A. Laughery will step down as
chief executive of Hardee's Food Systems, the fast food restaurant
company announced Tuesday.
   Laughery will continue as chairman of Hardee's and will continue
his service on the board of Hardee's parent company, Imasco Ltd. of
Montreal.
   Bill Prather, who joined the Hardee's organization four years ag
as president and chief operating officer, will assume the duties of
chief executive officer on Jan. 1, the company said in a news
release.
   Bob Autry, president and chief operating officer since 1988 of
Fast Food Merchandisers Inc., the distribution and manufacturing
company that services Hardee's Restaurants, will assume the title
of chief executive officer of that organization at the same time.
   Laughery has been chief executive officer of Hardee's for the
past 16 years. During Laughery`s leadership of the chain, Hardee's
Food Systems has grown from 750 restaurants to more than 3,300 in
42 states and nine foreign countries.
   During the same period, operating profits have grown at a
compound annual rate of 22 percent. Sales for the company will
exceed $3.5 billion for calendar year 1989.
   As chairman, Laughery will spend a major portion of his time
working closely with the Hardee's franchise community. ``There are
exciting days ahead for Hardee's,'' Laughery said. ``My commitment
to the chain is undiminished and I look forward to a continued
relationship with Hardee's and its franchisees.''
   Headquartered in Rocky Mount, N.C., Hardee's Food Systems says
it is the third largest hamburger fast-food chain in the world.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilots, Management Discuss Return to Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' pilots union met with management
Tuesday to negotiate a return to work after the collapse of the
pilots' 8{-month strike.
   Federal mediator Sam Cognata of the National Mediation Board was
sitting down for discussions with the two sides behind closed
doors. But the airline was taking a hard line in public on the fate
of the 2,200 pilots who last week ended their sympathy walkout.
   ``The reality of the situation is that once strikers were not
available to work, when the replacement workers take those jobs,
they inherit a right to those jobs,'' Eastern Vice President Tom
Matthews told reporters.
   Miami-based Eastern, which began rebuilding without its unions
after the Machinists struck on March 4, said it has enough pilots _
1,850 _ to operate its current schedule. Of those, about 1,000 were
hired as replacements; the rest crossed picket lines during the
strike or were management pilots.
   Skip Copeland, who heads the Eastern chapter of the Air Line
Pilots Association, took a conciliatory position as Tuesday's
meeting opened.
   ``We're going to have to somehow come to a position that's
acceptable to both parties, however that is,'' Copeland said. ``We
know our position and their position are tremendously different
right now. They say that we've been replaced; we say status quo.''
   The meetings were expected to break up after the session so ALPA
leaders could consider Eastern's proposals.
   The airline's flight attendants union, which also voted last
week to abandon its sympathy strike, was scheduled to meet
Wednesday with management. The Machinists union has been left alone
on the picket lines.
   Eastern has asked a federal judge in Miami to clarify the rights
of employees who are currently working and determine the rights of
strikers who wish to return to work. Company spokesman Robin Matell
said no hearing date had been set.
   Eastern last June sought in bankruptcy court in New York to have
the striking pilots' contract invalidated, but later withdrew that
request.
   After direct talks broke down, the pilots requested federal
mediation. There also were negotiations with the court-appointed
bankruptcy examiner, attorney David I. Shapiro.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors five days
after the strike began, and is currently in bankruptcy
reorganization under court supervision.

<HEAD>Grains and Soybeans Higher Despite Lack of News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade despite the lack of news to
influence trading.
   Soybean futures closed higher as traders reacted to a sense that
the market was oversold in the wake of Monday's sell-off of soybean
futures.
   ``There wasn't much selling in the market today, it was all done
yesterday,'' said analyst Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. Prices plunged Monday on slack export sales and bearish
technical signals.
   Soybeans also received support from the Malaysian palm oil
market, where futures were higher yesterday after last week's
weakness, Gustafson said.
   Palm oil accounts for the largest share of edible vegetable oil
traded internationally. Its price has a big effect on soy oil
prices, Gustafson said.
   Wheat prices gained in the wake of the National Weather
Service's six- to 10-day forecast out Monday. The outlook calls for
continued dry weather in winter wheat crop areas.
   Corn prices were higher on expectations of another week of
strong export shipments, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was } cent lower to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.06} a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2} cents higher with December at $2.34\ a bushel; oats were

   Environment ministers from the 12
European Community nations on Tuesday approved formation of an
agency to monitor environmental developments.
   The European Environment Agency should be functional by January
1991 if it gets final approval from the European Parliament, said
Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's Commissioner for the Environment.
   Ripa di Meana said the agency would collect and interpret
standardized environmental statistics from its member states.
   The information would be used by the EC's executive commission
to establish environmental policy for the trade bloc. Non-EC
countries would be eligible to join the agency but their
applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   Although no budget has yet been fixed for the agency, the
ministers agreed it would be partly financed by the EC's budget and
partly by national budgets of its member countries.
   The agency would be run by a 14-person management board
consisting of a representative of each EC nation and two Commission
representatives. It also would have a nine-person scientific board.

   The administration's nominee to run nuclear
weapons production has taken a lower-ranking post in the arms
program until the Senate concludes its drawn-out hearings on the
nomination early next year, the Energy Department said Tuesday.
   In his new appointment as principal deputy assistant secretary
for defense programs, Victor Stello Jr. can work on the weapons
program without Senate confirmation.
   In an internal memorandum disclosing the appointment, Energy
Undersecretary John Tuck said Stello would hold his new title for
an ``interim period'' pending Senate action on his nomination as
assistant secretary for defense programs.
   Stello has been working for Energy Secretary James D. Watkins as
a special adviser on nuclear weapons matters since President Bush
announced his nomination last July. In that period, Stello remained
on the payroll of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where he
served as executive director for operations.
   On Monday, Stello officially quit his NRC post to take the
Energy job, said Joseph Fouchard, a commission spokesman. Stello
worked for the NRC, which regulates commercial nuclear power, and
its predecessor the Atomic Energy Commission, for 24 years.
   The latest manuevering by Watkins stems from the political
controversy surrounding the Stello nomination. Several prominent
members of Congress, including some members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee that held confirmation hearings earlier this
month, claim Stello is unfit for the position.
   Stello's critics contend he lacks enough commitment to nuclear
safety and that his reputation for drawing controversy could
undermine the credibility of the weapons program at a time when
public trust in the program's safety is declining.
   In the latest sign of trouble in the weapons complex, the
department on Tuesday dispatched a high-level team of experts to
the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in Colorado to try to
resolve ``continuing safety concerns.''
   Watkins said ``this is a critical time at Rocky Flats,'' but did
not elaborate beyond saying federal and state officials had raised
unspecific safety issues at Rocky Flats, which already is under FBI
investigation for alleged environmental violations.
   After confirmation hearings on Stello Nov. 15 and 16, the Senate
Armed Servies Committee decided to postpone action until after
Congress reconvenes in January. The panel held open the possibility
that Stello would be asked to testify again.
   Tuck said the appointment was made after Watkins consulted with
Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services Committee chairman, and
John Warner of Virginia, the panel's ranking Republican.

<HEAD>Florida Farm Workers Protest Cheap Foreign Labor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Florida farm workers marched
outside a meeting of federal labor officials Tuesday to protest a
citrus company's plan to import hundreds of foreign pickers at
rock-bottom wages.
   ``It's nothing but legalized slave labor as far as we're
concerned,'' said farm labor organizer Fernando Cuevas, who led the
protest. ``There's no reason to bring in foreign workers when we've
already got too many American workers.''
   At issue is the federal government's H-2 program, which allows
foreign workers into the country to pick crops when domestic labor
is in short supply.
   The program was started under the Immigration Reform and Control
Act in 1987 after farmer complaints that legalization of many alien
workers in recent years had depleted their labor pool.
   Oakley Brothers Inc., a Lake Wales-based grower, has petitioned
the government to bring in 942 workers from Mexico in January to
pick citrus at a prevailing rate of 65 cents a box.
   ``Sixty-five cents is an absolute minimum rate that Oakley wants
to pay to everyone,'' said farm worker Tirso Moreno. ``It's not
that there's not enough American workers _ there's just not enough
who will work for 65 cents a box.''
   Moreno said other growers are paying seasonal rates ranging from
$1.03 to $1.23 a box.
   Cuevas claimed that growers such as Oakley are seeking foreign
workers who will agree to substandard wages and working conditions,
which he said undermines domestic workers and puts more Americans
on welfare.
   About 75 chanting, sign-carrying demonstrators marched outside a
hotel where more than 200 federal farm labor officials were holding
a national planning conference.
   Some of the conferees who oversee the H-2 program said every
effort will be made to protect domestic workers.
   ``For us to approve Oakley's petition, it has to be demonstrated
that they've exhausted their domestic supply of workers,'' said
Carol Gaudin, Atlanta regional administrator for the U.S.
Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration.
   Gaudin said a decision will be made on Oakley's petition up to
12 days before the January picking date when workers are needed.
   ``Every effort is being made to hear the concerns of the
domestic workers,'' she said, adding that federal representatives
were to meet with the farm worker representatives.
   The application by Oakley is the first by a citrus or vegetable
grower in Florida under the federal program. H-2 workers from
Jamaica have been used the past few season for cutting sugar cane.
   An Oakley spokesman did not immediately return telephone calls
Tuesday.

   An alliance of powerful investors including
oil fortune heir Gordon P. Getty said Tuesday it had increased its
stake in Avon Products Inc., the cosmetics company, to 8 percent.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Chartwell Associates, a limited partnership, said it had purchased
an additional 652,800 Avon shares, increasing its stake from 6.9
percent earlier this month.
   Avon, which previously vowed to fight to maintain its
independence, has twice thwarted unsolicited takeover efforts this
year, including one by Dallas-based Mary Kay Corp. the parent of
Mary Kay Cosmetics.
   A spokesman for New York-based Avon, John Cox, declined to
comment on the latest development.
   Partners in Chartwell Associates include a senior executive of
Mary Kay, the Gordon P. Getty Family Trust and the Fisher real
estate family of New York.
   In the SEC filing, Chartwell Associates said it bought 652,800
shares between Nov. 15 and Monday for prices ranging from $36 to
$37 per share.
   Earlier this year, Avon rejected outright takeover proposals
from the direct sales company Amway Corp. of Ada, Mich., and from
Minneapolis-based investor Irwin Jacobs. Avon also rejected
takeover feelers from Mary Kay.

   The stock market closed higher today as
investors remained focused on the direction of the economy and
interest rates.
   The market opened weak following Monday's rally then stalled
around midday after the Dow Jones industrial average pierced the
psychological resistance level of 2,700.
   The blue-chip indicator had not closed higher since the day
before the Oct. 13 stock plunge when it reached 2,759.84.
   The market regained its footing in mid-afternoon behind a
strengthening bond market, but wasn't able to sustain a strong
rally as volume faded.
   ``It was a sleepy, slow day, not the kind of market that gives
people inspiration,'' said John Burnett, senior vice president at
the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Analysts said recent actions by the Federal Reserve confused
investors and sent many scurrying to the sidelines to await fresh
signals as to its intentions.
   The Federal Reserve on Monday drained reserves from the banking
system in a move that surprised many observers. The Fed action
pushed up the federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks
charge each other for overnight loans.
   Last week, the Fed added funds to the system, which many
analysts took as a signal that the central bank was allowing
short-term interest rates to fall in an effort to cushion the
impact of a slowing economy.
   Analysts said that despite the confusion investors remained
generally optimistic that interest rates are in an overall
declining pattern.
   ``Over the next couple months the perception is that rates have
to come down so there's no reason to get excited about short-term
action by the Fed,'' said Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst with
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Oil stocks led the blue-chips on the upside, while technology
stocks remained generally weak, equities traders said.

<TEXT>
   The 104-year-old Miller &amp; Rhoads department
store chain, once a pricey trendsetter for Christmas shoppers, sat
Tuesday like a rack of last season's fashions as officials sought
buyers for the failing operation.
   The demise of Miller &amp; Rhoads, which has 14 stores in Virginia
and North Carolina, followed a gloomy trend in the retail industry
that has left giants like Campeau Corp. struggling with debt after
buying Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. and
L.J. Hooker Corp. liquidating six of its seven B. Altman &amp; Co.
branches.
   Ironically, Miller &amp; Rhoads was once part of Allied. The
investor group that owns Miller &amp; Rhoads bought it from Campeau in
1987, six months after Campeau won a $3.4 billion takeover battle
for Allied and began selling stores to pare its debts.
   Miller &amp; Rhoads President John E. Stokely said Monday the
company had filed a plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court contemplating the
sale of all its assets rather than attempting to reorganize the
business.
   Stokely confirmed reports that circulated for the past week that
May Department Stores Co., the nation's seventh-largest retailer,
was negotiating to purchase four Miller &amp; Rhoads stores for its
Hecht Co. chain based in Washington, D.C.
   A news conference scheduled Tuesday by Hecht officials at which
the purchase was expected to be announced was canceled. May
spokesman James Abrams said there were still details to be worked
out but ``there has been no change in our intentions whatsoever.''
   May owns 14 department store chains including the upscale Lord &amp;
Taylor. The 22-store Hecht chain had $759 million in sales last
year.
   The fate of Miller &amp; Rhoads' other stores remained in doubt
Tuesday, although Stokely said negotiations were under way with a
potential buyer for two branches in Roanoke and Lynchburg. He would
not identify the buyer.
   The planned sale of Miller &amp; Rhoads came as other big department
store chains, including Federated's Bloomingdale's division, were
also on the block. Campeau said recently it would sell
Bloomingdale's to raise badly-needed cash.
   Two other big chains _ New York-based Saks Fifth Avenue and
Chicago-based Marshall Field _ also are up for sale. Their owner,
Britain's BAT Industries PLC, is restructuring its businesses as it
fights an unwanted takeover bid.
   Retail industry analysts said it may take some time for Miller &amp;
Rhoads to sell its stores.
   ``There are a lot of department store properties on the block
now, and people are being careful about what they're paying,'' said
analyst William Smith of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Miller &amp; Rhoads filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection
last July, listing debts of $87.3 million and assets of $129.6
million.
   The company suffered from the same sluggish sales that afflicted
many other retailers. It began to have cash flow problems soon
after the investor group led by Philadelphia developer Kevin F.
Donohoe purchased the stores from Campeau for $65 million.
   ``Miller &amp; Rhoads has been a basket case for some time,'' said
Pamela Stubing, an analyst with Moody's Investment Service in New
York. The debt from the 1987 purchase ``probably was too much for
them,'' she said.
   Donohoe, who controlled 83 percent of the company, said sales
for fiscal 1989 were $142.5 million, down 3.1 percent from $147
million the previous year.
   Stokely said Miller &amp; Rhoads would operate through the Christmas
season, including after-holiday returns and refunds. ``Our
customers can be confident that we will continue to operate
normally,'' he said.
   Miller &amp; Rhoads had planned to trim the chain to eight stores by
next spring, leaving four stores in the Richmond area, three in
Hampton Roads and one in Charlottesville.
   But Stokely said the company's ``current circumstances and
financial condition led the board of directors to conclude that a
reorganization as a profitable going concern is not feasible.''

<HEAD>Revised Reorganization Plan Filed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. filed a revised
joint stock plan of reorganization with U.S. Bankruptcy Court on
Tuesday.
   The consumer products company, which manufactures Sunbeam and
Oster small appliances, has been reorganizing under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws since February 1988.
   The revised stock plan continues to be jointly proposed by
Allegheny International and its secured bank lenders.
   The plan provides for payment in full in cash of pre-petition
Sunbeam claims, except for certain obligations that are being
reinstated. It also provides for payment in cash of $23.75 million
to Sunbeam institutional lenders in full settlement of all claims
for post-petition interest and other charges.
   Allowed claims of Allegheny International's secured bank group
would be paid in cash to the full extent of cash available. But
Allegheny International management said it does not anticipate any
cash will be available for such distribution.
   As a result, it is expected the secured bank claims class would
instead receive about 59 percent of the reorganized company's new
common stock. It also is believed Chemetron creditors and creditors
of certain other Allegheny International subsidiaries will receive
about 11 percent of such common stock.
   Allegheny International said in a statement the official
committee of unsecured creditors informed the company if will not
support the stock plan.
   The stock plan is expected to take effect around March 31, 1990.

   Petroleum futures prices tumbled Tuesday despite
an OPEC agreement to limit crude oil production.
   Energy market analysts said traders doubted that the 13 members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would abide by
their promises and keep oil output to 22 million barrels a day in
the first half of next year.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, slid 38 cents to close at $19.25 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for
delivery in February through April posted similar declines.
   The January crude contract ended with a 19-cent loss on Monday.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc also
ended lower, in part due to the developments at OPEC's regular
winter conference. Heavy wholesale gasoline stocks in the Northeast
and technical selling also weighed down gas futures.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery dropped 1.36
cents to settle at 49.53 cents a gallon, adding to Monday's loss of
0.74 cent. Contracts for later delivery also finished sharply lower.
   No. 2 heating oil for December delivery shed 0.61 cent to 60.31
cents a gallon after falling 0.49 cent in the previous session. The
January through March contracts finished with larger declines.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker at E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said: ``I think that the market lost ground today on
skepticism regarding the recently concluded OPEC agreement.''
   OPEC's 13 ministers, meeting in Vienna, Austria, signed a
production-limiting deal intended to raise the price of their crude
oil to at least $18 a barrel and curb cheating on individual output
quotas in the first half of 1990.
   The ministers agreed to raise the cartel's self-imposed daily
production limit to 22 million barrels from the current 20.5
million barrels. OPEC also changed its ``target price'' of $18 a
barrel to a ``minimum reference price.''
   A basket of OPEC crudes monitored by the cartel stands at $17.74
a barrel.
   Apart from the possibility that OPEC members, Kuwait in
particular, might overproduce, Lebow said there is speculation the
cartel has been overly optimistic in its demand projections for
next year. This means that even if OPEC stays within its limits, it
would still have excess crude.
   Meanwhile, he said gasoline futures prices have been depressed
by industry statistics showing abundant supplies on the East Coast.
Weekly figures from the American Petroleum Institute, due to be
released after the market closed, were expected to confirm another
buildup in gas stocks.

<HEAD>Report Says Some Farmers Gouging on Crop Subsidies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some farmers are still gouging the government
by collecting crop subsidies in excess of limits set by Congress,
the Agriculture Department's watchdog agency said Tuesday.
   In one case, the department's Office of Inspector General said,
an individual collected about $2.8 million in subsidies, 56 times
the $50,000 limit set by law.
   The semiannual report to Congress on investigative and audit
activities cited other abuses including crop insurance
overpayments, loopholes in debt restructuring by the Farmers Home
Administration and flaws in the export subsidy program.
   By law, the crop subsidies, called ``deficiency payments,'' are
not supposed to exceed $50,000 per person per year. These are
direct payments to help make up the difference between depressed
market prices and higher ``target'' prices set by the government.
   For example, last month the price of corn at the farm was $2.20
a bushel. The target price for 1989 corn is $2.84.
   A ``person'' can be an individual, a joint stock company, a
corporation, an association, a trust or some other legal entity.
   The report said ``abuses in the program continued'' in spite of
efforts by Congress in the 1987 Omnibus Reconciliation Act to close
loopholes. Overall, in 1987, an estimated $66 million was paid to
farmers who dodged the $50,000 limitation.
   Investigators have found that big operators often reorganize to
qualify additional ``persons'' for the purpose of collecting larger
payments.
   In one case, an individual used relatives, employees and
business associates as ``persons'' under the program, the report
said. Those totaled at least 21 in 1986 and 29 in 1987. Payments
totaled about $2.8 million for the two years, plus more in 1988 and
1989, which are under review by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   ``We have recommended that ASCS improve its review procedures
and withhold 1989 payments until final eligibility is determined,''
the report said.
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said: ``Outrageous payments such as these undermine
public support for farmers. A few bad apples are giving all farmers
a bad name.''
   A spokesman for the National Farmers Union, Michael V. Dunn,
said that loopholes in the law are ``something we've been concerned
about'' for a long time.
   ``We end up with subsidies going to all types of corporations
and corporate investors,'' he said. ``We have long advocated
targeting those payments to family-sized operations.''
   Other findings in the report, which covered the six months ended
Sept. 30, included:
   _Loss adjustment errors by the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. and
reinsured private companies resulted in overpayments estimated at
$91 million out of $716 million paid out in claims. Underpayments
totaled $1.6 million.
   _Under Farmers Home Administration debt-restructuring
procedures, borrowers were able to sell off security property and
still qualify for ``buyout'' benefits. Buyouts allow borrowers to
have debts written off by FmHA after buying back the note at 30
cents on the dollar, based on the value of the remaining property
held as collateral.
   ``For example, one borrower improperly disposed of a portion of
collateral securing outstanding debt totaling $160,000,'' the
report said. ``However, since the borrower qualified for the
buyout, FmHA allowed the borrower to buyout the debt for about 30
cents on the dollar, a loss to the government of $112,000.''
   The report recommended FmHA seek legislation that would deny a
``buyout'' to anyone who demonstrated a lack of good faith under
the debt-restructuring program.
   _Subsidized sales of farm commodities to designated foreign
countries are provided under the Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP. Private exporting companies collect the subsidies, or bonuses,
in the form of surplus commodities held by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   The subsidies enable the exporters to charge foreign customers
lower prices than otherwise would be the case. And that enables
U.S. products to compete in overseas markets with other suppliers,
notably the European Economic Community, which has export subsidy
programs of its own.
   But investigators said they found that ``some countries in the
program do not show strong competition with U.S. commodities.''
Overall, the report questioned EEP bonus payments of $151 million
for transportation costs, which ``may not be allowed'' by federal
law, and payments of $89.8 million that resulted from ``a possible
miscalculation of world prices.''

   The stock market closed higher in cautious
trading Tuesday as the market remained focused on the economy and
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.04 points to
2,702.01 behind a strong performance in the energy sector. The
blue-chip indicator had not closed higher since the day before the
Oct. 13 stock plunge, when it closed at 2,759.84.
   The market opened weak following Monday's rally, surged briefly,
then stalled around midday. It regained its footing in
mid-afternoon behind a strengthening bond market, but wasn't able
to sustain a strong rally as volume faded.
   ``It was a sleepy, slow day, not the kind of market that gives

   Analysts blamed the sluggishness on recent actions by the
Federal Reserve, which they said confused investors and sent many
to the sidelines to await fresh signals as to its intentions.
   The Federal Reserve on Monday drained reserves from the banking
system in a move that surprised many observers. The Fed action
pushed up the federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks
charge each other for overnight loans.
   Last week, the Fed added funds to the system, which many
analysts took as a signal that the central bank was allowing
short-term interest rates to fall in an effort to cushion the
impact of a slowing economy.
   ``There is not a broad-based interest in equities because of
concern and confusion over the status of the economy and when the
Fed is going to ease interest rates,'' said Edward P. Nicoski,
technical analyst with the investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood
Inc.
   Energy stocks led the blue chips upward in what analysts said
could be the start of a bullish period for oil companies as the
reindustrialization of Eastern Europe gets under way. Analysts also
cited an agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to limit output in the first half of 1990 as a possible

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was generally lower Tuesday as
interest rate concerns continued to dominate the foreign exchange
markets.
   Gold prices were mixed as traders began to take profits in
response to the metal's recent gains.
   Analysts said the dollar moved higher in early trading following
signals on Monday that the Federal Reserve was not lowering
interest rates. When interest rates rise in the United States,
dollar-denominated securities and the U.S. currency itself become
more attractive to investors.
   The dollar has fallen in recent sessions amid expectations the
Fed would move interest rates lower. But Monday's developments
``caused a momentary hesitation in the market'' and traders began
buying dollars early in Tuesday's session to shore up their
positions, said Robert Ryan, senior foreign exchange trader with
the Bank of New York.
   But the dollar continued its slide in later trading because of
continuing expectations that interest rates would rise overseas,
particularly in West Germany, making foreign currencies more
valuable, said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset
Management Inc.
   The West German mark has been strong against most currencies
since East Germany opened the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, raising
expectations that West German industry would benefit from the new
opening to the East and that the Bundesbank would raise West German
interest rates.
   The mark suffered from some profit-taking Tuesday, but still
closed higher. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7770 marks from
late Monday's 1.7890 after slipping earlier in Frankfurt to 1.7880
marks from 1.7900 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.5880 Swiss francs, down from 1.6040; 6.0710
French francs, down from 6.1100; 1,312.75 Italian lire, down from
1,320.75; and 1.16645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16665.
   The dollar also declined against the British pound. One pound
cost $1.5670 in New York, compared with $1.5585 late Monday, and in
earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.5625 from $1.5605 late
Monday.
   The dollar rose slightly to 143.20 Japanese yen in New York from
late Monday's 143.195. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing
143.65 Japanese yen from 143.35 yen, and in London, the dollar
traded at 143.69 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.5950 Swiss francs, down from 1.6050; 6.1035
French francs, down from 6.1125; 2.0270 Dutch guilders, up from
2.0203; 1,319.50 Italian lire, down from 1,321.25; and 1.1674
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1670.
   Gold prices were mixed in New York and lower overseas amid a
second straight day of profit-taking. Gold had risen steadily
during the past two months and broke through the $400 an ounce
level Nov. 21 for the first time since January, and traders had
been expected to take some profits.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold fell
50 cents to close at $413.40, while the Republic National Bank of
New York quoted a late bid of $413.35, up 40 cents.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid price of $411.25 a
troy ounce, down from $414.25. The late bid price in Zurich was
$410.50, down from $414.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $409.35 bid, down from $418.15.
   Silver rose 0.30 cent on the Commodity Exchange to close at
$5.693 a troy ounce. Earlier in London, silver fell to a late bid
of $5.64 a troy ounce, down from $5.73 late Monday.

<HEAD>Polaroid Announces New Medical Venture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. announced Tuesday it was developing
equipment for hospitals to take electronic pictures, as the company
tries to compete more in the medical business while continuing to
look beyond instant photography.
   ``This is a complete and total departure in some ways,'' said
Len Aberbach, Polaroid's director of medical imaging.
   Polaroid, based in Cambridge, said its electronic imaging
technology for hospitals is in the developmental stage and will be
available for sale in 1991. The company gave a preview of its plans
this week in Chicago at the annual meeting of the Radiological
Society of North America.
   The new imaging system is designed to record images from
electronic diagnostic tools in hospitals, giving doctors pictures
of internal organs and other body parts.
   Like traditional Polaroid systems, the new system will record
images that are instantly available and require no processing
equipment or darkroom facilities. But unlike other Polaroid
materials, the technology will not rely on light-sensitive film.
   Also, the company said, the system will provide pictures as
sharp and as detailed as those processed in conventional
photography and doctors will be able to enhance the images.
   ``The new system is the forerunner of an era of electronic
imaging for Polaroid, an era of new imaging devices and new media
that we, with our instant photography heritage, are particularly
well suited for,'' I. MacAllister Booth, president and chief
executive officer of the company, said in a prepared statement.
   Polaroid built its success around instant photography, but
recently the company has been moving into other ventures, including
conventional film.
   The strategy comes as the company tries to rebuild profits after
the last fiscal year, when Polaroid lost $22.6 million while
fending off a hostile takeover bid.
   Part of the company's new approach is to promote the use of
instant photography for businesses, such as real estate, insurance,
auto body repair and architects.
   Polaroid for years has marketed its products to medical
professionals, Aberbach said in an interview from Chicago.
Ophthalmologists have used standard Polaroid film to take instant
pictures of patients' retinas, while plastic surgeons have used it
for photos of people's faces.
   But Aberbach said Polaroid was unable to maintain a strong
position in the medical market because the company did not offer
the technology to meet hospitals' specific needs.
   Polaroid's medical-related sales exceed $100 million, Aberbach
said, but the overall market for medical diagnostic imaging has
about $13 billion in sales annually.
   But while the company is targeting the medical field for its new
technology, Polaroid officials said other groups, such as graphics
designers, might be able to use applications of the system in the
future.

   Precision Airlines, a regional airline
operating in the Northeast, said Tuesday it had agreed to be bought
by another small carrier.
   Northeast Express Airlines, of Bangor, Maine, was buying the
Manchester-based Precision for an undisclosed amount, said Fred
Martin, Precision's vice president for marketing. The sale was
expected to be completed on Friday, he said.
   Precision, which has 300 employees and 13 planes, flies from
Manchester to Boston, Newark, Philadelphia and New York's LaGuardia

   ``Financially, there will be more new money coming in and this
will allow us to continue through the slow time of the year and

<HEAD>Regulators To Begin Working on Dual Trading Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal commodity futures regulators approved
plans Tuesday to begin a long process for developing rules to
restrict dual trading in a limited pilot project.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the dual
trading curb project as an objective for fiscal year 1990.
   The CFTC's Division of Economic Analysis released a study
earlier this month that said dual trading does not enhance market
liquidity or present other benefits, as claimed by its supporters.
   Dual trading, in which floor traders can conduct transactions
for themselves as well as their customers, is legal but has come
under sharp criticism since more than 40 traders were indicted last
August on various fraud charges.
   Critics charge that dual trading was linked to many of the
alleged schemes uncovered at the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The CFTC's Division of Trading and Markets is working on
proposed rule-making that would restrict dual trading on a
staggered, phased-in pilot basis by floor members in certain
markets, subject to certain exceptions.
   The CFTC did not specify what exchanges or what exceptions would
be included in the proposed rules.
   In the first quarter of fiscal year 1990, the division will
prepare proposed rules for consideration by the five-member CFTC.
   Following a 60-day comment period the division will begin
drafting final rules in the second quarter, with final approval of
the dual trading curbs coming in the third quarter.

<TEXT>
   Colt Industries Inc. said Tuesday it
would sell its beleaguered firearms division to a group of
investors in a deal that could end a nearly 4-year-old strike by
some union workers.
   Terms of the sale to CF Holding Corp., which includes a Colt
executive and two former United Technologies Corp. officials, were
not disclosed. Analysts had said they expected the sale to bring
between $150 million and $200 million.
   The deal at the 153-year-old company that makes the Colt .45
pistol ended 3{ months of negotiations as well as attempts by
striking union workers to buy the division.
   Michael Dunn, a spokesman for New York-based Colt Industries,
said company officials expected to complete the sale in January.
The new company will be called Colt's Manufacturing Co.
   The new owners said they did not know how many people will be
employed by the company, but they extended an offer of sorts to
striking United Auto Workers who walked off the job in January 1986.
   Anthony D. Autorino, one of the investors, said the new company
would contact current and striking Colt workers immediately and
begin hiring based on skill and seniority within three weeks.
   ``We think this will work out well for the people of Connecticut
and the workers as well,'' Autorino said in a statement.
   Colt currently employs about 950 workers at plants in Hartford
and West Hartford. Another 800 union workers are still on strike.
   Colt was founded in Hartford in 1836 by Samuel Colt, who
invented the revolver. The firearms division is a leading
manufacturer of handguns and rifles for military and commercial
uses.
   Products include the Colt .45 pistol, the King Cobra Magnum
revolver, AR-15 sport rifle and the M-16 military rifle. The
company also makes aerospace and automotive parts.
   Colt lost its contract to produce the M-16 for the Army in 1988.
The loss of that contract, coupled with the strike, apparently
figured in Colt's decision to sell that division, but company
officials deny it played a role.
   ``The buyout of Colt Firearms division by the CF Holding Corp.
offers us an opportunity to write a new chapter for Colt workers,
and I am hopeful that all the elements of this will come
together,'' Phillip Wheeler, executive director of the UAW's Region
9A, said in a statement.
   The investors include Autorino, former president of United
Technologies' Hamilton Standard division and now president of
Wethersfield-based Shared Technologies; Richard F. Gamble, another
former president of Hamilton Standard; and Ronald F. Stilwell, Colt
Firearm's vice president for military sales.
   Autorino declined to identify the remaining investors.
   When Colt announced in April it was seeking a buyer, the union
and managers of the firearms division combined forces with the
state and private investors to make a bid. State officials declined
to comment on Tuesday's announcement.
   About 1,050 union workers walked off the job Jan. 24, 1986,
after failing to reach agreement on a new contract during 10 months
of negotiations. Some workers have crossed picket lines and others
have found new jobs, leaving about 800 on strike. Replacement
workers have been hired to fill their positions.
   Autorino said the Colt plants are to close briefly in January to
allow for inventory and transition. He said the plants should be
operating at full capacity by March 1990.
   ``We have fairly extensive marketing and strategy plans which we
think can bring Colt back into its rightful place at the top of the
industry,'' Autorino said.
   In September, a judge found that Colt changed working conditions
unilaterally and refused to bargin in good faith with the striking
workers. The judge ordered Colt to rehire the strikers and pay lost
wages, estimated as high as $40 million.
   Autorino declined to discuss how the award figured into the
sale. Wheeler did not immediately return phone calls seeking
comment.

<HEAD>Investment Bank Buys Carvel Ice Cream Chain</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `Tom Carvel ...,' to CORRECT description of Thinny

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international investment bank has bought the
Carvel ice cream chain from its 83-year-old founder, Tom Carvel,
the bank announced Tuesday.
   Investcorp paid more than $80 million for a 99 percent share of
Carvel, which is the nation's third-largest ice cream store chain
based on annual sales after Dairy Queen and Haagen-Dazs, said
Robert Glaser, a member of Investcorp's management committee.
   The privately-owned Carvel has more than 700 stores, mainly in
New York, Florida, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and other
East Coast states.
   Tom Carvel founded the Yonkers-based company in 1934. His
gravelly voice became familiar to many Americans through homey,
long-winded commercials in which he pitches the virtues of
fancifully named Carvel products like Fudgie the Whale and Cookie
Puss ice cream cakes, Flying Saucer ice cream sandwiches and Thinny
Thin frozen low-calorie desserts.
   Tom Carvel will remain a consultant and adviser to the company
but will not continue making the commercials, said Glaser.
   With the purchase, which took effect Nov. 21, Investcorp also
acquired control of two other food businesses owned by Carvel:
Nedick's hot dogs and Dugan's bakery products.
   Investcorp said it hopes to expand Carvel's business by
increasing the number of franchises, modernizing its brand image
and introducing new products.
   ``Many of the investments we've made in the past have been good
companies with good products that would benefit from the injection
of new capital and new energy,'' said Glaser. ``Carvel has a good
name and we want to build on that.''
   ``We are confident of Carvel's future prospects,'' said Sanio W.
Tung, Investcorp's representative on the Carvel board of directors,
in a statement. ``The outlook for the ice cream confectionary
business is very favorable; we anticipate healthy growth of Carvel
in the coming year.''
   Investcorp has offices in Bahrain, New York and London. Its
other corporate investments have included Tiffany &amp; Co., Gucci,
Dellwood Foods, and yacht manufacturers Bertram &amp; Trojan.

   Precious metal futures prices were mixed in active trading
Tuesday on New York's Commodity Exchange as bargain hunting
developed a day after profit-taking sent prices sharply lower.
   On other markets, energy futures were lower, grain and soybeans
prices rose and livestock and pork futures declined.
   Gold ranged from 50 cents higher to 60 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in December down 60 cents at $413.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with December at $5.695
cents a troy ounce.
   Gold prices continued Monday's slide in early trading, but
reversed direction as speculators began to bargain hunt. Prices
also were helped as the dollar weakened during the day, nearing its
1989 low against the West German mark.
   ``Gold continues to be bought by speculators,'' said analyst
Peter Cardillo of Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York. ``Basically, there
still is a sense of fear about the strength of the economy.''
   Energy prices declined sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as traders reacted to news that OPEC ministers reached a
new production agreement that would raise the group's output
ceiling to 22 million barrels a day and maintain a target price of
$18 a barrel.
   Analyst Robert Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York said the agreement, reached in Vienna, Austria, ``had a few
more leaks in terms of quota dicipline'' than was desired by the
market.
   ``The agreement was signed with the recognition that the United
Arab Emirates would continue to overproduce,'' Baker said, adding
that Kuwait would also continue to surpass its quota.
   The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have been producing 2
million barrels a day apiece, or double their current quotas.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 29 cents to 43 cents lower
with January at $19.25 cents a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to
.94 cent lower with December at 60.31 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .80 cent to 1.36 cents higher with December at 49.53
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade despite the lack of news to influence trading.
   Soybean futures rose as traders reacted to a sense that the
market was oversold in the wake of Monday's sell-off of soybean
futures on slack export sales and bearish technical signals.
   ``There wasn't much selling in the market today, it was all done
(Monday),'' said Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Soybeans also received support from the Malaysian palm oil
market, where futures were higher Monday after last week's
weakness, Gustafson said.
   Palm oil accounts for the largest share of edible vegetable oil
traded internationally. Its price has a big effect on soy oil
prices, Gustafson said.
   Wheat prices gained in the wake of the National Weather
Service's six- to 10-day forecast released Monday. The outlook
calls for continued dry weather in winter wheat crop areas.
   Corn prices were higher on expectations of another week of
strong export shipments, analysts said.
   Wheat was a { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with December at
$4.06} a bushel; corn was } cent to 2{ cents higher with December
at $2.34\ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1} cents higher with
December $1.43} a bushel; soybeans were a { cent to 3} cents higher
with January at $5.79} cents a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Frozen pork belly prices fell the daily limit as profit-taking
took over after a run up of prices in recent sessions.
   Cattle prices were lower in anticipation of increased marketing
by producers, and analysts said beef demand has slackened because
retailers' shelves are full.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .63 cent lower with December at
75.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .45 cent lower
with November at 83.55 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .65
cent lower with December at 50.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.75 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 62.55
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Cement Company Announces Restructuring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lone Star Industries Inc., which makes
cement and other construction materials, said it plans to sell
several businesses, real estate and other assets as part of a
restructuring.
   The board of directors adopted the program to improve the
company's cash flow and profitability, said James E. Stewart,
chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement issued Monday.
   The company said the reorganization would result in a $250
million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter, but did not say how
the charge would affect results for that period.
   Lone Star's net income in the third quarter was down 66 percent
from the same quarter last year, to $1.8 million from $5.5 million.
   Lone Star was not specific about which businesses it plans to
sell, but said several in the Southwest were targeted. It also said
it would sell interests in certain joint ventures, an investment in
preferred stock and surplus real estate.
   The company has 22 cement plants, including operations in Texas,
Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   The cash generated from selling assets would be used to repay
debts and improve the company's liquidity, the company said.
   ``The new Lone Star will be made up of the company's strongest
and most profitable assets and will emerge as a strong and healthy
industry leader, capable of re-establishing a long-term record of
profitability and rewards to its shareholders,'' Stewart said in
his statement.
   Lone Star has been hurt by continued softness in the
construction industry. It also is the target of lawsuits by
railroad companies that claim Lone Star sold them defective
railroad ties, although a spokesman said the suits had no
connection to the restructuring.
   Lone Star is a major producer of cement, ready-mixed concrete,
sand and gravel, crushed stone and precast concrete products.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp., undergoing a corporate
restructuring, announced Tuesday it would sell a major part of its
leasing operations to a Japanese bank and that it expected to post
a substantial fourth-quarter loss.
   Bank of Tokyo Ltd. will pay $110 million to acquire all the
operations and 225 employees of Bank of New England's New England
Merchants Leasing Corp., as well as approximately $500 million of
its lease portfolio.
   The sale is part of the bank's plan to streamline its operations
and focus on its core businesses, primarily in New England. Changes
in tax laws have made the leasing business less attractive, and 80
percent of the bank's leasing business is outside New England, the
bank said.
   Bank officials expect the transaction to be completed by early
1990.
   Chairman Walter J. Connolly Jr. said the bank expected to add
substantially to its reserves at or before the end of the year due
to the effect of the continuing softness in the region's real
estate market on the bank's loan portfolio. He said the bank
expected the fourth quarter ``will show a substantial loss.''

<HEAD>Report: Shearson Considering Outside Investor for Cash Infusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is considering
selling a large block of its shares to an outside investor to
provide a cash infusion for the troubled investment house, The New
York Times reported in its Wednesday editions.
   The identity of the investor was not known, the Times said.
   Under the proposal, American Express Co., which owns 62 percent
of Shearson, would sell a large percentage of its shares to the
investor, the Times said, citing unidentified sources. American
Express has said in the past that it wanted to cut its Shearson
holding to less than 50 percent.
   The sale of the shares would have to be approved by the
directors of both Shearson and American Express. Such a deal could
be hindered or blocked by opposition from Nippon Life Insurance
Co., the Japanese company that owns 13 percent of Shearson and
holds two seats on the company's board.
   On Oct. 30, Moody's Investors Service placed Shearson's debt and
commerical paper under review for a possible credit downgrading.
The credit rating concern cited the profitability problems among
Wall Street firms as well as Shearson's exposure to commercial real
estate through one of its subsidiaries.
