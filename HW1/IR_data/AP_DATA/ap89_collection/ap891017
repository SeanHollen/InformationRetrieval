   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy hit the airwaves
Tuesday to attack his autobiography's critics, questioning the
motives of those challenging his assertion the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. had extramarital affairs.
   Abernathy appeared on NBC's ``Today'' show in the morning and
the network's ``Donahue'' program in the afternoon.
   Black leaders, including other former King aides such as Jesse
Jackson and Andrew Young, denounced the book last week, calling for
Abernathy to repudiate passages about the slain civil rights
leader's personal life.
   Abernathy wrote that King had a weakness for women, and that he
had sexual encounters with two women and fought with a third woman
the night before his 1968 assassination in Memphis, Tenn.
   The critics also cited Abernathy's two recent strokes, and
expressed doubts he wrote the book, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling
Down.''
   On ``Today,'' the 63-year-old Atlanta minister said Jackson
``was not honest with Martin Luther King. He wanted to fire him,
and I had to suspend him after I became the president of the
SCLC,'' the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   ``Martin was angry with Jesse because Jesse was always trying to
upstage and steal some of the glamour away from Martin,'' Abernathy
said on ``Donahue.''
   Abernathy said the criticism from his civil rights colleagues
``tells me that most of the black leaders in this country are not
concerned about the movement, the poor people, the downtrodden.''
   Abernathy suggested Young's motive for criticizing the book was
political. Young, the outgoing mayor of Atlanta, is expected to run
for governor of Georgia.
   Asked by ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel about three other black
leaders who have criticized his book _ NAACP executive director
Benjamin Hooks and Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Bill Gray, D-Pa. _
Abernathy called them ``good men.''
   ``All of these men that you're saying are good men have
repudiated the book and have a problem with it,'' said Gumbel.
   ``But they have not read the book,'' Abernathy replied. ``You
have to read the book in its entirety.''
   Hooks appeared on ``Donahue'' with Abernathy, and disputed
Abernathy's account that King had trysts.
   ``I cannot understand to save my life even if it were true how
he could say it,'' Hooks said.
   He suggested that Abernathy's ill health and pressure from
publisher Harper &amp; Row led to the inclusion of the controversial
material as well as what Hooks said were factual mistakes in the
book.
   ``If Ralph had been in control, he would have caught those
errors,'' he said. Harper &amp; Row has said the words in the book were
Abernathy's.
   After the show, Hooks and Abernathy embraced, laughing and
chatting.
   Earlier, when Donahue asked Abernathy about his health,
Abernathy got out of his seat, waved an arm and snapped his
fingers. ``I can do anything,'' he said. He also gave a rambling
account of an operation he underwent.
   Roy Innis, director of the Congress of Racial Equality, appeared
on ``Donahue'' to defend Abernathy, arguing that despite the
revelations in the book, ``King's stature is still as great.''
   On ``Today,'' Abernathy repeated his contention that he had
little choice but to write an honest account of King's ``difficult
time'' resisting sexual temptation because previous King historians
have addressed the subject.
   ``I wanted to make it look like Martin Luther King Jr. was
simply a human being, that he was not a god, he was not a saint,
but he was a human being, a mortal human being subject to make
mistakes and errors,'' Abernathy said.

<TEXT>
   An Ohio senator said Tuesday he wants a new
Energy Department safety oversight board to review the possibility
that tanks holding radioactive and chemical waste at the Hanford
nuclear reservation could explode.
   Earlier, Democratic Sen. John Glenn's staff released a 1984
report which concluded in a worst case the tanks at the reservation
in southcentral Washington state could explode with a force of 36
tons of TNT and scatter radioactivity widely.
   A followup report just months later, however, essentially
dismissed the danger of explosion, according to a spokesman for the
lab that prepared both reports.
   Washington state officials said Tuesday that the followup report
focused on different chemical compounds found in the tanks and that
the earlier report had ``some validity.''
   The Energy Department is currently studying the tanks and the
potential for explosions and a spokesman said a report could be
issued as early as next spring.
   The possibility of a tank explosion is a key question as the
department tries to decide whether to leave the waste in place or
remove it, solidify it and store it elsewhere.
   ``The risk of explosions from these waste tanks has not received
the attention it deserves,'' said Glenn as members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee questioned nominees to the Department of
Energy Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board. ``We are not just
dealing with an abstract problem.''
   Glenn said later that the five members of board need to ``look
over the shoulder'' of the department and offer a ``second
opinion'' on environmental, safety and health issues.
   ``Questions like those about these tanks should not go on year
after year without being resolved,'' said Glenn, who sponsored the
legislation creating the board.
   There was no indication from the nominees of what they planned
to do about the tanks. The prspective chairman, John T. Conway,
said the new board would have to look at all nuclear safety issues
in the nation's nuclear weapons-building complex.
   A possible explosion in one of the tanks would not be a nuclear
blast, but could spread radioactivty.
   The explosion of a similar tank at Kyshtym in the Soviet Union
in 1957 or 1958 scattered intense radioactivity over an area the
size of Rhode Island, killing hundreds of people and forcing such
an extensive resettlement program that 30 villages simply
disappeared from maps, Glenn said.
   The wastes, both chemical and radioactive, are byproducts of
more than 40 years of plutonium production. Some of the
single-shell tanks at Hanford date back to the Manhattan Project
that built the first atomic bomb in World War II.
   There has never been a waste storage tank explosion at Hanford,
but DOE officals have said there have been ``burps'' caused by
small gas bubbles.
   Both the 1984 report and the followup report were done by
Battelle Northwest Laboratories for contractors at the reservation.
   According to the 1984 report, up to 140 tons of ferrocyanide may
be contained in old, single-shell tanks at the reservation.
   The ferrocyanide was added to the liquid waste stream from 1954
to 1975 to precipitate radioactive cesium and radioactive
stronitum, two metals, the report said. The goal was to produce
additional tank storage space by concentrating the waste.
   ``Mixed with nitrates and nitrites, both of which are in the
tanks, cyanide has been shown to undergo explosive reactions when
heated,'' the report said.
   The report said that under a ``worst-case scenario'' the energy
released from a single waste tank could be equivalent to that of 36
tons of TNT.
   ``At present, there is insufficient information to state that
the hazard of a potentially violent cyanide reaction does not
exist,'' the report said.
   The report said large amounts of cyanide were placed in at least
14 of 149 tanks at the reservation, with possibly up to 30 tons in
a single tank.
   Ken Morgan, a department spokesman in Richland, Wash., said that
19 tanks contained the cyanide.
   The cyanide could be explosive if it reached temperatures higher
than about 650 degrees Fahrenheit, the report said. Morgan said
current temperature in the tanks is less than 130 degrees.
   But Morgan said the 1984 report failed to pass peer review, a
process in which it is critiqued by other scientists, and was never
published.
   ``To say that (wastes) can explode is as useful as saying the
flour in the kitchen can explode, which it can under the right
conditions,'' Morgan said.
   Gary Petersen, a Battelle spokesman, said the second,
peer-reviewed report released in June 1985, concluded the chance of
a potential reaction among the chemicals was ``non-existent or
negligible.''
   But that report focused on organics in the tanks, not
ferrocyanides, Battelle spokesman Jerry Holloway said later in the
day.
   ``I don't buy it,'' Don Provost of the Washington state
Department of Ecology, said of the second report's conclusion
downplaying the possibility of an explosion. ``I think the 1984
report had some validity.''

   The government has ordered the closure
of five factories that produced contaminated cookies that have
killed 36 people since mid-summer, a senior official says.
   Sudomo, the government's coordinator for defense and political
affairs, told reporters Tuesday after meeting with President
Suharto that the government was trying to withdraw all contaminated
cookies from markets throughout the country.
   Kusparmono Irsan, director of the Criminal Investigation
Department, said employees of a freight-forwarding firm confused
sacks of ammonium bicarbonate, an ingredient in baking powder, with
sodium nitrate when unloading cargo from Hong Kong in April.
   The sodium nitrate was sent to the cookie factories by mistake,
and beginning in July ended up in cookies. Sodium nitrate is used
in making explosives and fertilizers.
   The government so far has been unable to determine how many
contaminated cookies were produced.

<TEXT>
   It was a typical Friars Club roast: celebrity
victim (Bruce Willis); dais thick with cigar smoke (thanks, Uncle
Miltie); air blue with obscene jokes (sorry, not printable). But
this time, for the first time, women were permitted to share in the
fun.
   ``They have caved in to reality, surrendered to reality. ...
They have to enter the 20th century,'' said attorney Gloria Allred,
whose complaint about the Friars' no-women roast policy opened the
doors Tuesday for about two dozen females at the Willis affair.
   Ms. Allred entered after a brief but nasty exchange with a Friar
who told her, ``You're yesterday's news, lady. We don't care about
you.'' Ms. Allred, proclaiming ``sexism is yesterday's news,''
walked past him.
   ``I feel it should have been done a long time ago,'' said
Marilyn Haft, an entertainment lawyer who attended the roast. ``But
it's sexism, and it takes time to change sexism.''
   Ms. Allred arrived at the Sheraton Centre shortly before the
noon roast, anticipating a fight to get in. But other female guests
already had entered the roasting room, preventing a repeat of the
Ernest Borgnine affair she was ejected from last year.
   The Friars, founded in 1904, have banned women from their roasts
with only a few exceptions: Lucille Ball and Phyllis Diller have
been roastees. Never before were women allowed in the audience.
   Despite the presence of the ladies, the roasters promised the
usual raunchy routines would not be toned down.
   ``After my five minutes, Bruce will be convicted of a felony,
I'm sure,'' said comedian Rick Ducommon. ``He might get a light
sentence, being such a big star, but he'll be convicted.''
   The Friars seemed to take the new policy in stride. Even Henny
Youngman, who engaged in a much-publicized argument with Ms. Allred
last year over the club's lunch policy banning women, appeared
kinder and gentler.
   ``Nobody bothers me any more. I got money saved,'' said Youngman.
   Comic Gilbert Gottfried felt the admission of women, while a
good thing, would not be personally rewarding.
   ``They could allow millions of women in here, and it still
wouldn't help me,'' said Gottfried. ``I'd still end up going home
with Henny Youngman.''

   The San Francisco earthquake Tuesday was ``a
good warning,'' the head of the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   `The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming. The
question is when,'' said Dallas Peck, director of the service, in
an interview.
   Tuesday's quake was ``not a trivial earthquake, but it was not a
1906 earthquake,'' Peck said.
   The survey's geologists estimated the magnitude of Tuesday's
tremor at anywhere from 6.2 to 6.9 on the Richter scale _ ``we'll
pin that down,'' Peck said _ while the 1906 quake has been
estimated at up to 8.3.
   Tuesday's quake ``is telling us we've got a lot to learn and to
do better,'' strenghtening buildings and other structures to
withstand a major quake, Peck said.
   At present there is no way of warning of a specific quake at a
specific time _ but odds can be calculated. ``There was no
warning'' of Tuesday's, Peck noted.
   In July 1988, a committee of experts convened by the Geological
Survey was more worried about Southern California than the San
Francisco area.
   The committee estimated that a major quake _ one measuring 7.0
on the Richter scale _ had a 50 percent chance of occuring in the
San Francisco area along the San Andreas Fault, the fault involved
in Tuesday's shocks, during the next 30 years.
   That committee said the chance of such a quake in the following
10 years was about one in five.
   But a repetition of the 1906 quake was given odds of less than
one in 10 during the next 30 years.
   The San Andreas Fault runs along the western side of San
Francisco Bay. The Hayward Fault runs along the eastern side, and
the committee gave the same odds for a quake there.
   Southern California was seen at more risk.
   The committee said there was a 60 percent chance of a
7.5-magnitude quake along the Southern California segments of the
San Andreas Fault, and a 50 percent chance of one of magnitude 8.0
or greater.
   Elsewhere in Southern California, the committee put the chance
of a 6.5 quake on the Imperial Fault at 50 percent over 30 years,
and the chance of a 6.5 to 7.0 quake on the San Jacinto Fault near
SAn Bernardino-Riverside at at the same 50 percent during 30 years.

   Authorities recovered three bodies from
shallow graves inside a barn, the first such discoveries in a
search of the area that began last week, officials said Tuesday
night.
   The bodies were found on a farm belonging to Neil Bryan in the
northwestern Missouri community, about 90 miles northeast of Kansas
City. The bodies haven't been identified, authorities said.
   Authorities, acting on a tip, used backhoes and bloodhounds in a
search beginning Oct. 9 on a farm belonging to Ray and Faye
Copeland of Mooresville, 12 miles north of Bryan's farm.
   Bryan said he hired Ray Copeland to do odd jobs. The Copelands
have not been named as suspects in the case.
   Bryan said Copeland worked for him for about 20 years. ``I
didn't know he had any time to get into any mischief. He worked all
the time,'' said Bryan, who retired in 1968.
   Officials said they would continue searching the Bryan farm and
other unspecified sites.
   The North-Central Missouri Major Case Squad did not have
information about the ages or sex of the three bodies. ``Forensic
experts are still in the process of examining the remains,'' the
squad, which consists of state troopers and local law enforcement
officials, said in a statement.
   The bodies were discovered Monday and recovered Tuesday, the
statement said.
   Copeland, 75, and Mrs. Copeland, 68, were charged Oct. 9 with
conspiracy to steal in an alleged cattle swindle. They were being
held in the Livingston County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bonds.
   Jack McCormick, who worked as a middleman in livestock purchases
for the Copelands and was named in the charge against them, was at
the Copeland farm last week pointing out sites where deputies
should dig. McCormick was being held in the Sullivan County Jail.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the
Socialist who has eased Western concerns about where he would lead
Spain after his unexpected landslide victory seven years ago, is
heading for what polls indicate will be an unprecedented third term
in elections Oct. 29.
   Gonzalez, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer, has since led the
country into an economic boom with policies that upset some of his
own Socialists, labor particularly.
   He also has brought Spain into the European Economic Community
and reaffirmed its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   So far it has been a successful road for Gonzalez, who once had
to slip into Spain from France in the trunk of a car because his
party was outlawed by the authoritarian regime of Gen. Francisco
Franco.
   According to private and government polls, the Socialists are
expected to win at least 40 percent of the vote from the country's
29.5 million registered voters for their third absolute majority in
the 350-seat lower house of Parliament. They now hold 183 seats.
   Polls also indicate little on the right or left can block the
Spanish Socialist Workers Party, the official name of Gonzalez's
party.
   The main opposition group, the conservative Popular Party, is in
disarray, having struggled in the past two years for coherence
under three different leaders.
   Its current leader and candidate to replace Gonzalez is
36-year-old Jose Maria Aznar. He took the reins of the party less
than two months before Gonzalez, on Aug. 25, issued the call for
this election. The conservatives now hold 91 lower house seats and
are campaigning on a platform calling for privatization of state
industry, sharp cuts in public spending and lower taxes.
   Former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez of the Social Democratic
Center Party is repeating his 1986 attempt to recapture the office,
mainly with a call for the abolition of the 12-month obligatory
military service. His party now holds 28 seats in the lower house.
   In 1977, two years after Franco's death, the 58-year-old Suarez
formed Spain's first democratically elected government in 41 years.
   The Socialists' response to Suarez on the military service issue
is that they reduced the obligatory service time to the current 12
from the 18 months that existed during his administration. The
Socialists also ask how Suarez plans to pay for an all-volunteer
army.
   The United Left coalition under Julio Anguita, the 48-year-old
Communist and former mayor of Cordoba, is expected to gain up to
five seats more than its current seven by picking up the votes of
Socialists disillusioned with the Gonzalez government, which they
perceive as having shifted towards the center-right.
   Their slogan, ``We Are the Alternative,'' is aimed at members of
the General Workers Union, the country's largest and historically
Socialist labor movement. The union has not called on its rank and
file to vote Socialist this time, claiming that the Gonzalez
government has failed to promote an equitable distribution of
Spain's new wealth.
   According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, Spain's per capita gross domestic product rose from
$4,192 in 1984 to $7,449 in 1987, the year after Spain joined the
EEC and confirmed its membership NATO.
   Its annual growth rate of 5 percent is Europe's highest.
   In the 1982 campaign, when Gonzalez ran in his first successful
campaign, his anti-NATO stance and populist style made Western
leaders nervous.
   In this campaign, Gonzalez and other Socialist leaders maintain
that opposition parties have failed to come up with serious
platforms and alternatives.
   ``Their exaggerated negativism is a reflection of their
frustration,'' Gonzalez has said. ``They would be better off if
they tried to come up with alternatives that would appeal to
voters.''
   Another issue that has upset the opposition is Gonzalez's wife,
Carmen, who is running for Parliament on the Socialist ticket in
Cadiz.
   Opposition parties have compared her to Eva Peron, who had an
exceeding influential role in Argentina as the wife of populist
dictator Juan D. Peron, and to Imelda Marcos, the wife of former
President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines.
   Gonzalez's only response to those who make the comparisons is
that they lack ``democratic sentiment.''

   The telephone was ringing off the hook
at a company that specializes in belly dancers and ``exotic apes,''
courtesy of some unexpected advertising on ``Monday Night
Football.''
   The ABC telecast pitting the Los Angeles Rams and Buffalo Bills
showed a classified ad placed last week in the Buffalo News
designed to recharge the Bills' sluggish defense.
   But the camera shot also took in the ad that appeared just above
it: ``BELLY &amp; hula dancers, exotic apes, male dancers, 773-2433.''
   ABC announcers Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf joked about the
belly dancers and emphasized they weren't advising people to call
the number. That, of course, caught the attention of a nationwide
audience looking for some thrills during what had been a dull game
up to that point.
   As of Tuesday, at least 75 people had telephoned the Showbiz
Entertainment Service run by Nick and Marlene Sidoti out of their
home in Grand Island, just north of Buffalo.
   ``For a $4 ad, I got myself $75,000 or $100,000 worth of
advertising,'' Sidoti said. ``Thank you, ABC.''
   ``They were asking if we could send entertainment over for
halftime,'' Sidoti said. ``One guy said, `Why did you put the ad
on? Why didn't you just put the belly dancers on?'''

   Axel Hanson capped a perfect driving
career with what officials called a rare act: voluntarily giving up
his driver's license at age 88.
   ``I figured at my age I might make a wrong move sometime or
other,'' Hanson said. ``I thought it was a good idea to give up my
license for my own safety and for other people, too. I would hate
to be the cause of an accident.''
   Officials at the state driver's license examiners office in Eau
Claire said Hanson's decision was nearly as rare as his excellent
driving record _ no accidents or citations in 72 years on the road.
   ``In my 24 years as an examiner I maybe have seen six such
cases,'' said examiner Eldon Lustig. ``It's very rare when they
come in out of the blue and give up their license such as Mr.
Hanson did.''
   Hanson said he began driving at age 16. The first car he bought
was a 1921 Ford Roadster; the last was a 1966 Plymouth Valiant sold
to him 11 years ago by his son Wayne.
   Wayne Hanson accompanied his father to the examiners' office.
``I let Dad drive those last few blocks to the office and he was as
good as ever,'' the younger said.
   ``Now I'll just walk, I guess,'' his father said, ``and it will
be Wayne's turn to take us on Sunday afternoon drives.''

   Just the thought of eating fried chicken
at 8:30 a.m. might send some folks running for a sweet roll and
coffee.
   Not Orville Dickerson. He wouldn't miss being first in line for
the famous 50-cent anniversary chicken dinners at Haab's restaurant
in downtown Ypsilanti.
   It's the eighth time Dickerson has been first in line since
Haab's began celebrating its anniversary eight years ago with
prices from its original 1934 menu.
   Dickerson, 60, joined 2,139 other people who took advantage of
Haab's 55th anniversary feast Monday.
   Haab's co-owner Mike Kabat said 1,720 people ordered the chicken
dinner, which regularly sells for $7.45, about 260 ordered the
40-cent spaghetti plate and 151 ate 20-cent barbecued sandwiches.
   ``It's nice it only comes once a year, but it's nice to be able
to do something like this for people,'' said Nancy Hyde, after
spending five hours waiting on tables.

   An accident involving a tanker truck
carrying propane gas set at least two mobile homes on fire late
Monday night and forced the evacuation of a trailer park, a
sheriff's official said.
   ``There's two or three residences on fire,'' said Ross County
sheriff's Sgt. Don Haber. There were no immediate reports of
injuries, he said.
   It was not known how many vehicles were involved in the 11:10
p.m. accident, Haber said. ``The tanker overturned or exploded.
We're not sure,'' the sergeant said.
   Authorities ordered the evacuation of Charm's Trailer Park about
two miles from this village some 50 miles south of Columbus. Haber
did not know how many people were forced from their homes.

<TEXT>
   Northern rebels have launched a
major offensive, according to reports reaching the Ethiopian
capital, and the guerrilla forces have inflicted defeats on
government troops.
   According to diplomats in Addis Ababa, the rebels have pushed
government forces back and reached nearly to Dese, 155 miles from
the capital.
   The reports could not be confirmed. But a rebel advance to Dese
would raise a threat of cutting the road between Addis Ababa and
the Red Sea port of Assab, site of Ethiopia's only oil refinery and
one of two key points of entry for tons of emergency relief food.
   One African diplomat said President Mengistu Haile Mariam's
forces would have act to halt the rebel advance before it becomes
serious trouble for the government.
   The diplomats interviewed spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   The push southward is by a group calling itself the Ethiopian
Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Movement, a combined force of the
Tigre People's Liberation Front and the Ethiopian People's
Democratic Movement.
   The Liberation Front, which took up arms in 1974, is pressing
for increased autonomy for the province of Tigre and the overthrow
of Mengistu's Marxist government. The Front has an estimated 20,000
troops.
   The Democratic Movement, a smaller group, split four years ago
from the radical Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Party formed
after the 1974 ouster of the late Emperor Haile Selassie.
   The Ethiopian army went through a leadership crisis following a
May 15 coup attempt, when troops loyal to Mengistu killed at least
14 generals and the government jailed 100 senior officers.
   Officers appointed to replace those killed or imprisoned have
little field experience and apparently have failed to rally the
support of the troops, one African envoy said.
   In a speech after the coup, Mengistu said the rebellious
generals had lacked patriotism. He blamed them for the government's
repeated recent failures in clashes with the rebels.
   He was referring to rebel victories that began with a joint
offensive in May 1988 by the Liberation Front and the secessionist
Eritrean Peoples' Liberation Front when the rebels captured most of
Tigre and much of Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province.
   The Eritreans have been fighting since 1962, but in September
began peace talks with the government. The second round of talks is
scheduled for Nov. 18 in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
   The government recouped most of its losses in Tigre, but the
lines in Eritrea remained static. Another Liberation Front
offensive from February to March pushed government forces out of
nearly all of Tigre, setting the stage for the recent offensive.
   The reports said a string of rebel victories pushed 20,000
government troops and thousands of civil servants from the Tigrean
provincial capital of Mekele south to Maychew, near Tigre's
southern border and out of the province and into neighboring Wollo
last month.
   Diplomats said the army suffered a major defeat in Maychew,
where they said the rebels destroyed at least 15 Soviet-made tanks
and captured more than 20. The rebels also seized an unknown number
of anti-aircraft guns, multiple rocket launchers, and ammunition,
they said.
   ``Two divisions were wiped out,'' said one Western diplomat.
   The Liberation Front, in a clandestine broadcast Sept. 20, said
the rebels killed or wounded 17,000 government troops and captured
10,300. It was impossible to verify the claim.
   The Ethiopian government has an estimated 313,000 troops but the
morale of the soldiers is questionable.
   In addition to low troop morale, Mengistu also faces the problem
of financing the war, which he said consumed half of the
impoverished nation's budget this year.
   The World Bank calculates Ethiopia's per capita income at $120 a
year and considers the Horn of Africa nation of 49 million people
the world's poorest.
   Diplomats say the Soviet Union, Ethiopia's major arms supplier,
is pressing Mengistu to seek a political solution to the fighting.
   Addis Ababa residents say they are skeptical a negotiated end to
the war is possible in Tigre and Wollo and believe the rebels will
not stop until the current government is overthrown.

<UNK>Report Says Explosive</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tanks of radioactive waste at the government's
nuclear reservation in Washington state contain a potentially
explosive mixture, according to a five-year-old consultant's report.
   The report, never made public, was compiled by Batelle Northwest
Laboratories for the operators of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation
in 1984, Rockwell International Corp., according to a congressional
expert who described its contents Monday night on condition he not
be identified.
   The report estimated the potential explosive power of the
mixture at 37 tons of TNT if all the worst-case assumptions
underlying its analysis turned out to be true. Such an explosion
would not be a nuclear blast but could scattered radioactivity
widely.
   The explosion of a similar tank at Kyshtym in the Soviet Union
in 1957 or 1958 scattered intense radioactivity over an area the
size of Rhode Island, killing hundreds of people and forcing such
an extensive resettlement program that 30 villages simply
disappeared from maps.
   Environmental groups have said similar tanks at the Savannah
River site in South Carolina also pose a threat of explosion.
   The Hanford mixture could explode if it got too hot, and as long
as the waste is kept sufficiently moist, ``I don't think
realistically you can expect these tanks to blow up tomorrow,'' the
expert said.
   He said the tank mixtures are at about 100 to 200 degrees
Fahrenheit, while a realistic explosive danger would not arise
until the temperature reached 300 to 400 degrees.
   The expert said he obtained the report through state officials.
The Energy Department considered the report a draft which did not
have to be released, he said.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has said he will raise the report at a
confirmation hearing Tuesday for the first members of the Energy
Department's Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, the expert
said. Glenn was the author of the law that established the
five-member board last year.
   According to this expert's description, from 1954 to 1975
ferrocyanide was added to the liquid waste stream to precipitate
radioactive cesium and radioactive stronitum, two metals.
   The resulting less-radioactive liquid was dumped in the ground
and the two metals were removed while the ferrocyanide built up in
14 of 149 single-shelled waste tanks, he said.
   In all, 140 metric tons, about 154 U.S. tons, of ferrocyanide
waste accumulated in the tanks, and as much as 30 metric tons could
be in one tank, the expert said.
   The mushy waste complex also contains nitrate compounds that
could explode and is generating explosive hydrogen and methane
cases which have to be vented to the atmosphere, he said.

   The sometimes funny ``Look Who's Talking'' made
its debut as the nation's biggest moneymaker last weekend. ``Black
Rain'' dropped to fifth after three weeks at the top.
   Woody Allen's latest movie ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' earned a
fair $14,000 per screen in limited release in its first weekend.
   ``Look Who's Talking,'' starring John Travolta, Kirstie Alley
and Bruce Willis, collected $12.1 million, the biggest opening for
any fall film, said Deborah Stein, a spokeswoman for its producer,
Management Company Entertainment Group.
   The previous fall record was set earlier this year by ``Sea of
Love.''
   In second last weekend was the latest dead teen-ager sequel
``Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers.'' The slasher film
grossed $5.1 million in its debut.
   ``Sea of Love,'' the romantic thriller starring Al Pacino as a
detective whose chief murder suspect (Ellen Barkin) is also his
lover, sold $3.611 million worth of tickets to come in third.
   In fourth was Tom Selleck's prison drama ``An Innocent Man,''
earning $3.605 million. ``Black Rain,'' the international crime
caper starring Michael Douglas, earned $3.4 million last weekend.
   ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' the stylish comedy-drama featuring
Jeff and Beau Bridges as a struggling lounge act, opened in sixth
with $3.3 million in a limited release on 858 screens.
   In seventh was the family comedy ``Parenthood,'' with income of
$1.7 million. It was followed by the babysitting farce ``Uncle
Buck'' in eighth with $1.54 million.
   Rounding out the top 10 were the romantic comedy ``When Harry
Met Sally ...'' in ninth with $1.2 million, and ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors'' with $911,385. Allen's movie was released to only 66
theaters.
   Jane Fonda's and Gregory Peck's ``Old Gringo'' fell out of the
top 10 after just one week. In grossing only $501,810 last weekend,
``Old Gringo'' looks to be dead.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co.:
   1. ``Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $12.1 million weekend
gross, 1,208 screens, $10,023 per screen, $12.1 million total

   A man who tried to collect a $28 million
lottery jackpot with a forged ticket was arrested by officials who
noted the fake was pretty easy to spot: The computer drawing didn't
produce a winner.
   Ralph Brunner, 25, of Newtonville, was charged Monday with
forging a ticket for the Mass Millions lottery, said state Trooper
Ken Halloran.
   The fact that no winning number was drawn Friday night was
widely publicized, said David Ellis, spokesman for the lottery
commission.
   ``The world knew no one had won it,'' he said.
   Officials who examined Brunner's $2 ticket bearing the winning
numbers found the computer printing had been altered, Ellis said.
   The receptionist who accepted the ticket Monday asked Brunner to
fill out a claim form while officials studied the ticket. They
called police, who arrested Brunner.
   He was scheduled for arraignment today in Quincy district court,
Halloran said.

   More than 52,000 East Germans have flooded into
West Germany since Sept. 10, including Hardy Britze, Katrin Proehl
and their 4-year-old daughter. This is the first of periodic
reports of their progress as they adjust to life in the West.

   For Hardy Britze, the final
decision to flee West came after the dreaded East German secret
police searched his home and demanded to know how a baker could
afford a French-made Citroen.
   ``They searched my business and home, everything,'' Britze says.
   Now, after abandoning friends and parents in the city of
Cottbus, Britze said only political reforms could take him back to
his Communist nation, a prospect he says he hopes will one day come
about.
   ``For them I'm criminal now. We look forward to being allowed to
go back to visit our homes some day, but that won't happen without
major political reforms,'' says the husky 23-year-old Britze,
relaxing over a few beers in Frankfurt.
   Britze, his 23-year-old companion Katrin Proehl, and their
blonde, 4-year-old daughter, Linda, arrived in West Germany on
Sept. 13, two days after Hungary opened its Western borders to the
East German refugees.
   For now, they share one room in a city-run refugee home,
furnished with twin beds, a small table and desk with chairs, a
television, clothes closet and wash basin.
   ``It's a little small, but we expected things like that when we
decided to come here,'' Ms. Proehl said in an interview. ``We
expected to start at the bottom and work up. We'll be getting an
apartment soon.''
   Speaking as her daughter clambered on the bed to watch TV, Ms.
Proehl said the family was encouraged by its welcome here.
   ``Everyone has been so friendly and helpful to us. And shopping
_ fantastic. The first time we walked around the Kaufhaus
department store, we spent an hour just looking and looking.''
   The couple came with just a few clothes and personal belongings
packed in their car quickly for the trip from Cottbus, about 70
miles south of Berlin, to West Germany. ``We'll have to start from
scratch to furnish an apartment,'' Ms. Proehl said.
   ``We left a lot behind. We had our cafe and bakery, our own
business. We had our own home. But because of our car and business,
we had the `Stasi' in our house checking on us.''
   ``Stasi'' is short for Staatsicherheitsdiest, the East German
secret police.
   Britze inherited the bakery from his grandfather, and ``now the
`Stasi' will confiscate it,'' he said.
   ``Our families, grandmother, mother, brothers and sisters are
all still there. We telephoned them that we're here. But unless
things change there, I never, ever want to go back,'' Ms. Proehl
said.
   Britze added: ``We want to be free to decide what to do for
ourselves, take care of our own business. Maybe go to Venice or
Holland for a weekend. I can save money and do that here.''
   Britze said he's confident the family will make good in West
Germany.
   ``I am one of the lucky ones, we both already have jobs. I'm a
trained auto mechanic, and I begin as a service station mechanic on
Nov. 1. It's a start and I can work up from there,'' he said.
   ``Katrin starts the same day as a sales clerk in a boutique,''
Britze said. ``We also have an apartment lined up and will move in
within the next three months.''
   Although Britze feels free in West Germany, he still has
concerns about East German secret police.
   ``There have been cases of the `Stasi' going to other countries
like Hungary and grabbing people off the street to take them back
to jail in the GDR,'' he said.
   ``It's something you can't imagine if you've never lived there.
Here we are free to do as we want. There, you're locked in like an
animal.''
   Britze said his problems with East German police began 18 months
ago when he bought a used 1982 Citroen that had been imported new
to East Berlin for party members.
   ``When they got new Volvos in 1987, they sold their old cars and
I bought one for 50,000 East marks,'' Britze said. That works out
to about $3,000 at the black market rate or $26,000 at the official
rate.
   ``It was still a lot of money regardless of the rate,'' Britze
said, adding that he had saved the money from earnings at his
bakery. ``That's why the `Stasi' started harassing us.''
   After two searches of their property by the East German police
the couple decided to flee West. Hearing rumors that Hungary might
open its western border, they applied for a visa to vacation there.
   ``We didn't tell anyone our plans,'' Britze said. ``We got our
visa on Sept. 12, packed the car and drove all night. We were
searched twice by Czechoslovak border guards, but made it to Passau
in Bavarian at noon the next day.''
   The family registered in Passau, in West Germany's Bavaria
state, stayed overnight, then drove to Frankfurt where they have
some acquaintances.

<TEXT>
   Since becoming president two
months ago, F.W. de Klerk has promised repeatedly to seek a ``new
South Africa.'' To an extent, it is here.
   In the old South Africa, whites would have not turned on the
state-run TV news or looked at pro-government newspapers and seen
African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu gazing back, fist
raised, a free man.
   But on Monday, there was Sisulu, flanked by six colleagues, on
TV and the front pages of virtually every daily paper in the
country. Their guerrilla movement technically remains outlawed, but
at a news conference Sunday following their release from long
prison terms, they made clear that they were back at work.
   The ANC has never lost its hold on support in the black
community, but most whites have accepted the government's view that
it was a communist-controlled terrorist group, bent on forcible
seizure of power and imposition of a one-party system.
   Since de Klerk replaced P.W. Botha in August, however, the
political climate has changed dramatically. For the first time, the
government is openly acknowledging the ANC's broad popularity among
blacks, and even relatively conservative whites are beginning to
accept the inevitability of negotiations between the guerrillas and
the government.
   ``A difficult, dangerous period lies ahead of us, but this is
inevitable if there is to be a new South Africa,'' said an
editorial Monday in The Citizen, one of the newspapers most loyal
to de Klerk.
   The change in perceptions was epitomized by the remarkably
high-profile coverage that pro-government media gave to the ANC
news conference Sunday. Beeld, the largest-circulation daily for
the Akrikaners who dominate the government, ran a banner headline,
``Sisulu Speaks Out,'' above a large color photo of the seven ANC
leaders raising clenched fists.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. showed the same scene on
its morning news, with Sisulu urging ``orderly and disciplined''
pressure to force the government into further concessions.
   Beeld, significantly, played down the freed prisoners'
endorsment of continued guerrilla activity by the ANC and began its
article with Sisulu's call for a democratic system in which either
a black or a white could be president. There seemed to be no effort
by the newspaper, nor by the TV network, to stir up antipathy
toward the ANC.
   The release of the seven ANC leaders, along with a member of a
smaller guerrilla movement, was the most dramatic move yet taken by
de Klerk, but it followed a series of recent steps by government
officials aimed at enhancing the prospects for black-white
negotiations.
   Among these moves:
   _ For the first time in years, the government has allowed mass
demonstrations and marches by anti-apartheid activists. Hundreds of
thousands of people have joined these marches in recent weeks,
openly displaying ANC banners which in the past were likely to
provoke police action.
   _ The pace of desegregation has quickened. Johannesburg, the
country's largest city, has eliminated the last of its whites-only
public facilities, and only a handful of beaches remain segregated.
   _ De Klerk met for three hours with three prominent
anti-apartheid church leaders, including Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, by far the longest such talks in recent years between
a head of state and black activists. Government officials held
their first direct negotiations with activists on a 3-year-old rent
boycott in Soweto, the country's largest black township.
   There is debate over the degree to which these moves were
influenced by foreign political pressure. De Klerk says he intended
to move toward racial reconciliation regardless of overseas
opinion, but there no question that the threat of further sanctions
has been on his mind.
   ``Mr. de Klerk had to move quickly after his inauguration,''
said Con Botha, chief spokesman for the governing National Party.
``This (the prisoner release) is a continuation of what he said he
would do to make it possible for the leaders to get together to
negotiate.''
   As yet, de Klerk has won only modest praise for his moves, both
at home and abroad. Those whose goal is a non-racial democracy are
unlikly to applaud until the National Party negotiates itself out
of power.
   Almost wistfully, de Klerk spoke of this lack of recognition
after meeting Tutu last week.
   ``It appears,'' he said, ``as if the undertakings of this
government have not been fully appreciated.''

   Marina Ogilvy is two months pregnant and refuses
to marry the father until the child is born. She says her parents
are demanding they marry now or have an abortion.
   It is a sad and commonplace tale of modern morality, but it is
also an uncommonly public royal scandal: Miss Ogilvy is 24th in
line to the throne, her mother being the first cousin of Queen
Elizabeth II.
   The royal family recently suffered the breakup of the marriage
of Princess Anne, the queen's daughter. Now, royal-watchers say,
Miss Ogilvy, 23, has broken palace taboos by going public in lurid
detail about her estrangement from her parents, Sir Angus Ogilvy
and Princess Alexandra.
   The affair took on bigger dimensions Monday when Miss Ogilvy,
clutching the hand of boyfriend Paul Mowatt, broadcast a tearful
plea to her mother over BBC-TV.
   ``I want you to really stand by me and love me as a mother,''
she said in the taped interview with host Robert Kilroy-Silk.
   ``We believe we are doing the right thing and it's what we want
to do,'' Miss Ogilvy said.
   ``I don't agree that Marina should be pushed up the aisle into,
as such, a shotgun wedding,'' Mowatt said. They said the baby is
due in May and they plan to marry sometime afterward.
   Miss Ogilvy said in an interview published Oct. 9 in Today, a
London tabloid, that her parents had tried to trick her into an
abortion, disowned her, and cut off her $160,000 trust fund and
$450 monthly allowance.
   Her parents, in brief statements from their official St. James's
Palace residence, denied being ``cut off'' from their daughter.
They also have a son, James.
   ``Marina's parents sadly do not know where she is but Marina has
their (telephone) numbers and they would love her to get in touch
with them,'' said a statement issued Sunday night.
   Kilroy-Silk duly obliged by asking one of his talk show guests,
a royal-watching journalist who knows Miss Ogilvy, to give her
parents the phone number.
   The parents are making an official tour to India and Nepal later
this week and ``at the moment the tour has to proceed,'' said their
spokeswoman.
   Buckingham Palace, the queen's residence, declined to comment.
   Princess Alexandra, 52, receives $230,000 annually from the
money the state gives the queen, and it pays mainly for official
duties. Ogilvy, a commoner businessman, refused a royal title when
he married Alexandra in 1963.
   Mowatt, a 26-year-old free-lance photographer, says he did not
know Miss Ogilvy had royal connections until after their affair
began. Miss Ogilvy says that when she and Mowatt visited her
parents at their Richmond Park mansion in west London on Sept. 29,
they issued an ultimatum ``that you both get married before you
have the child or you have an abortion. If you don't do that we
don't really want anything to do with you.''
   ``I expected them to say ... whatever decision you come to, I
want you to know we will stand by you,'' she said.
   Andrew Morton, author of seven books on royalty, was quoted in
The Sunday Times as saying Miss Ogilvy had committed ``an act of
betrayal. ... No member of the royal family has ever done anything
as bitter as this.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of the British
bluebloods' bible, Burke's Peerage, said he was dismayed by Miss
Ogilvy's public antics.
   ``The strength of the royal family is that they've always closed
ranks and stuck together,'' he said. ``Disagreements always
happened behind palace walls.''
   He described Princess Alexandra as ``probably the most
compassionate person the royal family ever produced. ... No child
should act that way even toward parents who are less perfect than
these (the Ogilvys) are.''
   ``She has exposed the Achilles heel of the royal family to the
world,'' he said. ``If we're going to look at every single human
foible that people in the royal family have and decide the post is
no longer useful, the monarchy will disappear.
   ``It's of great interest to the public but not in the public
interest,'' he said.

ever seen in these here parts.
   The rocky hills west of Jerusalem seem an unlikely spot for a
rodeo, but Lipschitz and his partner, Doobi Solomon, on Monday
managed to draw a crowd of several hundred to watch the horseplay,
eat corn on the cob, and listen to songs such as ``You Are My
Sunshine.''
   Riders from the Galilee, the Golan and even the occupied West
Bank roped calves, pushed their steeds around barrels and made mad
leaps onto galloping horses in the pony express ride, much to the
delight of younsters in skullcaps packing plastic pistols.
   ``I've got horses in my blood,'' Lipschitz said when asked why
he started a rodeo and riding school near Jerusalem, whose stony
slopes are more associated with biblical shepherds than cowboys of
the Old West.
   He and Solomon are unlikely cowpokes. Lipschitz is from South
Africa, his partner from Rosh Pina in northern Israel. Both fell in
love with rodeos from seeing them in the United States.
   Lipschitz, 48, said he has always loved horses _ his father
raised thoroughbreds _ but it was in Texas and Arizona that he
``got bitten by the rodeo bug'' about seven years ago.
   When he decided to open a riding school in Israel in 1987, he
went to Scotland to buy purebred Arabians originally from lands to
the east that Israel has been at war with since its founding in
1948. He calls his horse Shades of Silver.
   Solomon, 33, spent two years in Oklahoma and California learning
rodeo tricks from Reg Camarillo, brother of world champion cowboy
Leo Camarillo, before he returned to his native northern Israel to
start a horse ranch.
   ``He was a good teacher, I was a good student,'' the bearded
Solomon said after he had put on a show roping dogies.
   There have been other rodeos in northern Israel, where there are
real, working cowboys, but Solomon said none had ever been
organized around Jerusalem.
   He said he hoped soon to have a full American-style rodeo but
that Neve Ilan, nestled in the hills above the Arab village of Abu
Gosh 10 miles west of Jerusalem, did not yet have the facilities
for bucking broncos and bull riding.
   ``You need a higher fence,'' he said.
   Even without the more dangerous rodeo rides, the crowd seemed
happy. Many bought straw cowboy-style hats made in Hong Kong, for
$5 apiece, and tapped their feet to a trio of fiddle, guitar and
banjo.
   ``I'm from out West, the West Bronx,'' fiddler Bruce Brill
replied when asked where he learned to play. His guitar-playing
friend, Dave Mencher, is from another New York City borough,
Brooklyn, and banjo player Sid Singer is from Liverpool, England.
   Steve Berger, who shoes the horses for Lipschitz's riding school
and comes from Pottstown, Pa., said he was not surprised at the
crowd's enthusiasm or size.
   ``Horses are really popular in Israel,'' he said. ``There are
thousands of them. Every week there are jumping shows. There are
races with all breeds, even though they're not regulated yet.''
   Around him stood men and women in chaps, fringed leather vests
and broad-brimmed, sweat-stained hats. But there were reminders
that this was Israel 1989, not Texas 100 years ago.
   One of the door prizes for the rodeo was special glass plating
for the winner's car to protect against stone throwers who've been
attacking Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the
22-month Palestinian uprising.
   Some of the pistols tucked into belts were quite real and up to
date, worn by Jewish settlers who live in the territories that
Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and still occupies.
   ``We should never need the guns,'' said Natie Charles,
originally from Livingston, N.J., whose pistol rested in his belt
next to the fringe of his Jewish prayer shawl. ``But it's better to
have them, just like life insurance.''

   Wall Street averted another Black Monday and had
a Blue Chip day instead, as some of the heaviest trading in history
produced a rally in big-name stocks and losses in many smaller
issues.
   The Dow Jones average, which represents stock prices of
America's 30 biggest industrial companies, rose 88.12 points, or
3.4 percent, to 2,657.38, erasing nearly half the losses suffered
in last week's Friday the 13th plunge.
   Volume totaled 416.29 million shares, the fourth largest in
history.
   It was a ``reasonably normal 400 million-share, 88{-point day,''
New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan Jr. joked at a news
conference.
   Share prices rebounded sharply early Tuesday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange following its biggest drop this year the day before. Other
Asian stock markets followed suit, rebounding from significant
losses Monday.
   Tokyo's closely-watched Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 618.89 points Tuesday, or 1.79 percent, in Tuesday's
morning session, regaining most of the 647.33 points it dropped
Monday.
   Gains were also posted in early trading in markets in Hong Kong,
Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Manila, the Philippines.
   In spite of Monday's gains in the Dow, stocks whose prices
declined outnumbered those that increased by a 5-to-4 margin at the
New York Stock Exchange. The 88.12-point gain was the fourth
largest point rise.
   ``When you get into a period like we're in now, there's always a
flight to quality. People want safety and they want companies that
have either documented growth rates or a safe dividend,'' said
Robert Kahan, manager of equity trading at Montgomery Securities
Inc. in San Francisco.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones average suffered its second-biggest
point drop ever, falling 190 points and raising fears of a repeat
of Oct. 19, 1987, when a Friday decline turned into a Monday rout
that knocked a record 508 points off the average.
   Indeed, it started to shape up as a repeat of Black Monday, with
sharp declines in foreign stock markets and the Dow Jones average
falling about 63 points in the first hour Monday.
   But after gyrating wildly, the market settled down in the
afternoon. Indexes of the American Stock Exchange and
over-the-counter stocks fell, but the New York Stock Exchange
composite index rose.
   ``What we're seeing is a demonstration that the safety valves in
the U.S. financial system are in place and operating,'' said David
Resler, chief economist of Nomura Securities International Inc. in
New York.
   The huge trading volume for the day was exceeded only by the 600
million-share sessions of Oct. 19 and 20, 1987, and the 450 million
shares traded Oct. 21, 1987.
   In lower Manhattan, tourists lined up early outside the New York
Stock Exchange, hoping to get an eyewitness view of the trading
spasms.
   ``I feel like I'm watching a car accident,'' said John Egan, 24,
a New Yorker waiting to get into the visitor's gallery.
   But in a sign of the market's underlying strength, stocks held
up in spite of a steep decline in the U.S. bond market and the
weakness in foreign stock markets.
   Stock indexes fell 1.8 percent in Tokyo, 3.2 percent in London
and a steep 12.8 percent in Frankfurt, West Germany, where one
trader described trading as a ``blood bath.''
   The dollar's value tracked the stock market and was mixed
against major currencies.
   Traders said the stock market benefited from the experience
gained in the 1987 crash. The New York Stock Exchange managed to
handle te heavy trading volume because of a big investment in
technology made after the crash.
   In addition, traders were soothed by a promise over the weekend
by the Federal Reserve to supply fresh money to the financial
system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing to
traders who lost money.
   It turned out that little action by the Fed was necessary. As a
precaution, the central bank injected about $2 billion into the
financial system on a day when it ordinarily would have drained
reserves.
   The Fed injects money into the banking system by purchasing
Treasury securities, putting cash into the hands of the sellers.
   ``The stock market was never in any danger,'' said Angelos
Michalopoulos, an independent bond trader in New York.
   Turmoil continued in the airline sector. Donald Trump announced
he was withdrawing his $7 billion bid for AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines, after the company's stock fell. However, he said
he would consider a new offer at a lower price. AMR fell $22.25 to
$76.37{.
   It was trouble with the pilot-management buyout of the parent of
United Airlines that sparked Friday's 190-point plunge in the Dow.
The UAL Corp. bidders continued scrambling Monday to put together a
new deal as the stock plummeted $56.87{ a share to $222.87{.
   The top three leaders in trading volume were all familiar blue
chips: Philip Morris, up $2 to $43; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., up $3.25 to $43; and International Business Machines Corp., up
$1 to $103.
   At the New York Stock Exchange, ``All of the systems throughout
the exchange have functioned extremely well throughout the day,''
chief spokesman Richard Torrenzano said. ``There has been no delay
of any kind.''
   There were communications all day between the stock exchanges,
the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Torrenzano said.

   Chanting in English ``We are here to stay,'' more
than 4,000 young people jammed into an East Berlin church for a
rock concert by musicians from across the land whose works bitingly
lampooned Communist leaders.
   While East Germany's opposition leaders have long flocked to the
relative safety of Lutheran churches, the concert symbolized the
new fervor of the growing movement to open up a tightly-controlled
society.
   Young and inspired by the zeal that carried along the 1960s
protest movements in the United States and Europe, the supporters
of East Germany's opposition movement are vowing to push for
changes from within.
   They do not want to join the refugee exodus.
   Rock bands and folk singers from across East Germany put on
Sunday's benefit at the Church of the Redeemer in East Berlin to
raise money for protesters who face trial after being arrested at
recent huge street demonstrations.
   Balladeers ridiculed the Communist government's sudden professed
willingness for dialogue, and the crowd sang along in English as a
band played John Lennon's ``Give Peace a Chance.''
   A folk singer from Leipzig parodied the rapid transformation
last week of the Communist Party's orthodox ideology chief, Kurt
Hager, from hard-liner to advocate of dialogue.
   ``Now Kurt Hager has invented dialogue,'' went one refrain,
followed by the sarcastic ``Reforms, we can start those tomorrow.''
   Opposition groups believe the hard-line Communist government is
attempting to sidetrack growing public calls for reforms by
promising a limited dialogue with opposition groups it has long
suppressed.
   The protests and the exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans
to the West in recent months have forced the government to be more
conciliatory to growing demands for change.
   But Communist leader Erich Honecker has rejected any talks with
opposition groups.
   Speakers at Sunday's benefit also talked of the brutal treatment
some protesters received after their arrest during demonstrations
in East Berlin.
   ``A man was forced to stand for 16 hours at a police station
before he collapsed,'' said one of the speakers. ``Two policemen
beat him until he pulled himself up.''
   During the more than three-hour event, representatives of
several opposition and reform-minded artistic groups announced new
protest plans and initiatives.
   Members of the Working Theater Federation vowed to hold a march
demanding press freedoms on Nov. 4, for example.
   Others called for reforms in the nation's closely supervised
education system and an independent investigation into the behavior
of state security forces during protests in cities across the
nation.
   Police have used force to end many demonstrations.
   Students groups declared their intention to form independent
federations and university officials demanded authorities not
aexpel students for taking part in the demonstrations.

   A 102-year-old Lithuanian immigrant waited 39
years to become a U.S. citizen, but he isn't going to waste any
time going about his civic duty.
   ``The first thing I'm going to do is support the Republican
party,'' Kazimieras Bandzevicius said after being sworn in as a
citizen Monday.
   The former banker and car dealer in Lithuania got special
attention when he swore the oath in a nearly inaudible voice before
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter.
   ``Welcome sir,'' Hatter said. ``It's never too late to become a
citizen.''
   Bandzevicius, a balding man with close-cropped gray hair who
squints through thick glasses and walks slowly with a cane, beamed
when he was called to pick up his citizenship certificate. Then, he
kissed the hand of his attorney, Kaye Evans.
   ``I feel really good today because I'm planning to live for a
long time,'' he said later in Russian translated by his
granddaughter, Olga Goodman, 46. ``The good Lord gave me good
health.''
   Becoming an American is the latest move in an eventful life.
   Born in rural Lithuania, he moved to Russian city of St.
Petersburg _ now Leningrad _ to get an education at age 9 or 10. He
eventually got university degrees in physics and mathematics, and
still has the honorary cross he received from the czar for his
scholastic achievements.
   He fled back to Lithuania during the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917 and then left his homeland for Germany in 1940. He came to the
United States 10 years later, moving first to Chicago and then to
Los Angeles in 1953.
   In this country, he worked as a machinist until failing eyesight
forced him to retire.
   Along the way he married Anna, the widow of a friend who was
executed during the revolution, and adopted her son and two
daughters. She died eight years ago.
   Bandzevicius said he draws hope from Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms, but the restructuring of Soviet society causes
him concern.
   ``He's afraid the country won't have the strength to change,''
Mrs. Goodman translated. If Gorbachev succeeds, Bandzevicius added,
he hopes it will someday mean independence for Lithuania.

   A scuba diver left unconscious after
an underwater accident died Monday night in a decompression chamber
aboard NASA's rocket booster recovery vessel, a Coast Guard
spokeswoman said.
   Keith Seigal, 34, of Cocoa Beach was pronounced dead at 10 p.m.,
said Petty Officer Anneta Culver of the Coast Guard's Mayport
station. He had been taken aboard the ship nearly five hours
earlier.
   The incident was not related to any protests of Tuesday's
scheduled space shuttle launch, said Culver, who noted that it was
Seigal's third diving accident. The second occurred just three
months ago.
   ``The first one there was nerve damage,'' she said. ``The second
accident, he refused medical treatment.''
   The Coast Guard picked up a frantic distress call from Seigal's
fiancee shortly after 4 p.m. Monday. Their 23-foot pleasure boat,
``C U Later Bye,' was anchored 20 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral.
   Seigal, who was diving alone at a depth of 140 feet, 4 feet from
the ocean floor, had lost consciousness after coming up from a
second dive, and was bleeding from the mouth and nose, Culver said.
   NASA's vessel, Freedom Star, was about three miles away, waiting
to recover the solid rocket booster after the launch of shuttle
Atlantis. Crew members offered the use of its decompression chamber
and the Coast Guard quickly transported Seigal to the ship in a
helicopter.

<HEAD>Tobacco Opponents Claim Victory With Expanded Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smoking foes are proclaiming victory following
House-Senate negotiators' vote to ban smoking on all continental
U.S. airline routes and on many flights to and from Hawaii and
Alaska.
   The restrictions, which must be approved by the House and Senate
before being sent to President Bush, would cover practically all of
the 16,000 airline flights scheduled in the United States each day.
   By the estimate of tobacco industry lobbyist Charlie Whitley,
the rules would allow smoking on about 55 flights daily. Lobbyist
Jo Ellen Deutsch of the Association of Flight Attendants said she
thought smoking would be permitted on fewer than 20 flights a day.
   ``This isn't even a compromise,'' said Nancy Hailpern, lobbyist
for the American Cancer Society, one of many health groups that
fought to expand current anti-smoking rules. ``We're using the word
compromise basically for the benefit of the other side.''
   ``With few exceptions, every airline passenger in America now
can look forward to smoke-free travel,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., who helped write the measure.
   Durbin and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who championed an
airline smoking ban in the Senate, predicted the legislation would
be approved by Congress.
   ``I don't think we'll have a bit of a problem,'' Lautenberg said.
   The tobacco industry was battered in Congress this year when on
Aug. 2, the House voted 259-169 to make permanent the current
smoking ban on flights of two hours or less.
   On Sept. 14, the Senate voted 77-21 against cigarette-state
lawmakers' effort to prevent adoption of even stricter rules. The
Senate then passed a permanent ban on all flights by a voice vote.
   With those defeats behind them, tobacco interests had to accept
what they could get.
   Whitley, a former Democratic congressman from North Carolina,
said of the adopted language, ``As much as it preserves, we'll take
that.''
   Flights from the West Coast to Hawaii and Alaska are scheduled
for less than six hours and would be covered by the ban, Lautenberg
and others said. Uncovered would be non-stop flights to those
states originating in the central and eastern United States.
   The prohibition would also apply to flights to or from U.S.
possessions in the Caribbean, but not to Guam.
   The current prohibition on smoking during short flights covers
80 percent of U.S. routes. Those restrictions are scheduled to
expire in April 1990. The new rules will take effect 95 days after
they are signed into law.
   The provision is part of an $11.9 billion transportation measure
for fiscal 1990 which House-Senate negotiators are still trying to
complete.
   During bargaining lasting several hours, Lautenberg initially
said he would insist that if House negotiators did not adopt the
Senate language, he would force the House to vote on his proposal.
He said he believed he would have prevailed on the House floor.
   But after House Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., and several
others objected, Lautenberg accepted the compromise offered by Rep.
Martin Sabo, D-Minn.
   ``I just felt it was a long, a very, very long time for people
not to be smoking,'' Sabo said, referring to the flights lasting
more than six hours.
   Senate negotiators accepted the compromise without voting. The
11 House bargainers adopted the language on a show of hands. There
was no official vote count, but the only member seen voting against
it was Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.

<HEAD>End of a Dream: Failed Police Recruit a Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All Danny Morales ever wanted was to become a
police officer _ so much so that he never considered college or
another career in his 21 years.
   When the dream began to slip away, he took the revolver he had
hoped to use as an officer and killed himself Friday in front of
his instructor on the Police Training Academy shooting range.
   ``Ever since first grade he has wanted to be a police officer,''
said Linda Zwier, 21, his girlfriend. ``It was the only dream that
he had ever had and he never talked about college, he never talked
about doing anything else.''
   ``He was very focused and dedicated, much more than most
people,'' said an uncle, Mark Morales of Louisville, Ky. ``I admire
the fact that he knew what he wanted to do with his life. There are
people who spend all of their lives searching for that.''
   His father and four uncles among them won six city high school
wrestling championships and three state championships. When
Morales' turn came, he didn't disappoint, winning two city
conference championships.
   After graduating from Milwaukee Tech High School, Morales got a
job as a police aide. He studied police science at Milwaukee Area
Technical College, biding his time until he turned 21, old enough
to apply to the department.
   He was accepted to the recruit class that started training Aug.
20. But a month later, his grasp on his future started to slip.
   He failed a firing range test and then failed the retest and
resigned from the academy Sept. 29.
   Then, he found out he was nearsighted, got glasses and appealed
his resignation. Trainers gave him another chance to take the test.
   On Friday, after a week of remedial training and full of renewed
hope, he returned to the range to retake the test.
   ``Danny felt real good and felt confident,'' said Geary Morales
of St. Francis, Minn., another uncle.
   But it quickly became clear the glasses hadn't helped.
   Morales needed a score of 210 of 300 in three rounds of shooting.
   He scored a poor 62 in the first round, and 66 in the second. He
needed an 82 in the third round, and it was clear he couldn't get
it.
   With one shot left, Morales turned his gun on himself, according
to the Milwaukee County medical examiner's report.
   Family and friends preparing for Morales' burial today said
suicide was completely out of character.
   ``I think the environment he was in, alone in that firing range,
didn't give him an opportunity to talk to someone for a few
minutes, and the fear was overwhelming,'' said Geary Morales,
adding he wasn't criticizing the police department.
   Police Lt. Peter Pochowski, who was Morales' supervisor when he
worked as an police aide, said: ``I believe it was a split-second
decision. It was not part of his life plan that day. In that one
second he saw his whole world collapse and he couldn't face what
had happened. ...''
   ``I just assumed he would do well in whatever he did,''
Pochowski said. ``He was a blue chipper. He was going to be one
hell of a cop.''

   Illusionists Siegfried and Roy returned home to
a reception of squealing kids and squirming white tiger cubs after
a year-long tour that drew 1.4 million people from Japan to New
York City.
   ``There's nothing better than sweet home,'' Roy said, holding a
restless white tiger cub as it nuzzled a microphone at an airport
welcoming ceremony Monday. ``I'm ready to stay here the rest of my
life. I missed the people. I missed the sunshine.''
   The stars of the airport welcome ceremony were three white tiger
cubs born July 3 in Japan and named Red, White and Blue. The cubs
kicked and squirmed and a flailing paw left a small cut on Roy's

   Prizefighter George Foreman is 41, but says he has
not yet reached the top of his form in the ring.
   And, Foreman adds, he expects to reclaim the world heavyweight
crown by beating undisputed champion Mike Tyson _ perhaps as early
as June.
   ``I haven't reached my peak by a long way,'' Foreman said
Sunday, on a trip to promote a new boxing video. ``I train harder
than any man in the world. That is my secret. The day I meet a man
who trains harder than I do, then I will quit.''
   At the airport news conference with Foreman was Joe Frazier, the
man he beat in two rounds in 1973 to claim the heavyweight title.
Foreman lost the title the next year when he was knocked out by
Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire.

   ``Zorba the Greek'' movie theme composer
Mikis Theodorakis, a former Communist member of the Greek
parliament, says he'll run again _ on a conservative party ticket.
   Theodorakis said Monday the turn-about was prompted by the
slaying of a politician by the extreme left-wing November 17
guerrilla organization.
   ``After Pavlos Bakoyannis' murder, which shook me, I decided to
mobilize myself in politics once again,'' Theodorakis said. He's

<TEXT>
   Award-winning author Scott O'Dell, who wrote
``Island of the Blue Dolphins'' and 25 other children's books, has
died. He was 91.
   He died Sunday of prostate cancer at the Northern Westchester
Hospital Center in Mount Kisco.
   O'Dell had written five books for adults before he turned to
historical fiction for children.
   ``The only reason I write is to say something,'' he said in a
1984 interview. ``I've forsaken adults because they're not going to
change, though they may try awfully hard. But children can and do
change.''
   O'Dell's books, which often featured female protagonists, won
numerous awards. ``Island of the Blue Dolphins'' won the John
Newbery prize in 1961 for the most distinguished contribution to
American literature for children.
   The story conjured up the life of a 19th century Indian girl who
lived alone on a coastal Pacific island for 18 years.
   O'Dell said he wrote the book after being angered by the
increasing number of hunters near his home in California.
   ``The Black Pearl'' and ``Sing Down the Moon'' also won Newberys.
   O'Dell won the 1972 Hans Christian Andersen Medal, which is
given to the author whose works have made the biggest contribution
to literature for the world's children.
   His most recent book, ``My Name is Not Angelica,'' was scheduled
to be published Oct. 30.
   Born in Los Angeles in 1898, O'Dell graduated from Stanford
University and worked for several years as a cameraman at Paramount
Studios.
   He published his first novel, ``Woman of Spain,'' in 1934.
   O'Dell was also a farmer in addition to being a book columnist
for the Los Angeles Times and a book editor for the Los Angeles
Daily News.
   He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Hall; a daughter, Susan
Anderson of Cohocton; a son, David Mason of Los Angeles; and seven
grandchildren.

<HEAD>NRC Staffers Allege Coverup of Problems at Texas Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
investigating charges by members of its staff that senior agency
officials tried to cover up evidence of serious problems at the
Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in Texas.
   In an Oct. 4 letter to commission Chairman Kenneth Carr, an
anonymous group of NRC inspectors said senior NRC officials had
manipulated inspection data to make it look as though the plant was
ready for fuel loading, although the inspectors said it was not.
   A copy of the letter and documents spelling out the commission's
plans to investigate the matter were released by the NRC on Monday.
   A special team of commission inspectors was dispatched to
Comanche Peak, about 40 miles southwest of Fort Worth, on Monday to
begin an 11-day assessment of the plant's readiness to begin
loading fuel for low-power testing. The $9 billion plant got its
construction permit in 1974 but has never operated.
   The plant had been scheduled to start loading fuel sometime this
month, although NRC efforts to verify the allegations appear likely
to delay the procedure.
   The anonymous inspectors implied agency documents had been
edited to create an untrue impression of the plant's readiness to
operate, and negative information about the plant owner's
performance was deliberately withheld from official inspection
reports.
   ``We believe that the commission should be aware of what we view
as manipulation and the exclusion of factual information,'' the
inspectors wrote in the letter.
   ``If such information were properly considered and evaluated, it
would indicate a less than satisfactory performance rating in some
areas'' by the plant owner, Texas Utilities Electric Co., and a
need for improvements before the NRC approves fuel loading, the
letter said.
   Joe Fouchard, an NRC spokesman, said the commission does not
know who wrote the letter but has no doubt that it is legitimate.
   ``We are treating it seriously,'' Fouchard said.
   Executives of Texas Utilities are scheduled to meet with the
five-member commission at its Rockville, Md., headquarters on
Thursday to discuss the matter.
   The letter did not spell out the flaws at Comanche Peak the
inspectors contended were covered up by the NRC, but the authors
included pages of draft inspection reports and internal NRC memos
they said demonstrated the seriousness of the problems.
   The NRC declined to release the draft inspection reports and
internal memos.
   Thomas Murley, director of the agency's Office of Nuclear
Reactor Regulation, said in an Oct. 10 letter to James M. Taylor,
the acting NRC chief of staff, that he had referred the coverup
allegations to the NRC inspector general.
   Murley wrote that he agreed Comanche Peak was not ready for fuel
loading and assured Taylor no NRC decisions had been made about the
plant's readiness.
   In their letter to Carr, the NRC inspectors said a draft report
on Texas Utilities' performance at Comanche Peak had incorrectly
concluded that there were no problems there.
   The letter said the views of ``those who knew the real
performance'' had been ``outvoted'' by senior NRC officials who had
little or no direct involvement with the site.
   ``Additionally, information and findings brought to the
attention of (the senior NRC officials) were deliberately excluded,
giving a false impression about the plant,'' the letter said.
   Comanche Peak is one of the most thoroughly inspected nuclear
power plants in the nation. After about 1,000 allegations of
construction flaws surfaced in 1982, Texas Utilities switched
engineering contractors and spent several years reverifying the
plant's design and repeating tests required by the NRC.

<HEAD>Justice Department Accused of Delaying Fernandez Iran-Contra Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is coming
under criticism from the Iran-Contra prosecutor for delaying the
criminal trial of a former CIA station chief.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said Monday that Thornburgh,
for ``no legitimate reason,'' is using court appeals to sidetrack
the prosecution of Joseph Fernandez.
   Fernandez was scheduled to go on trial in July, but the Justice
Department went to the appeals court after U.S. District Court
Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va., said Fernandez was entitled
to disclose certain government secrets.
   Last week, without notifying Walsh at the time, the Justice
Department asked the appeals court for another month to consider
whether to seek a rehearing. The motion was granted on Friday.
   Fernandez, who assisted Oliver North's Contra resupply network,
is accused of obstructing the Tower Commission and the CIA
inspector general's offices and making false statements.
   Thornburgh has ``repeatedly thwarted'' the prosecution ``by
last-minute, unannounced procedural maneuvers designed only to tie
this case in a knot of endless litigation,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh said Thornburgh ``has asserted no legitimate reason for
delay'' and that ``there is every reason to proceed promptly.''
   Asked about Walsh's arguments, Justice Department spokesman
Daniel Eramian said, ``We won't respond unless the court asks us
to.''
   After the appeals court ruled against the Justice Department,
said Walsh, Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis on Oct. 2
reported the department probably would not seek further court
review. Dennis, head of the department's criminal division, said
Thornburgh probably would file an affidavit prohibiting disclosure
of the information at the Fernandez trial, said Walsh's court
papers.
   Such a step could result in the charges against Fernandez being
dismissed.
   In addition, said Walsh, a Justice Department criminal division
attorney indicated last Wednesday the division had sent a memo to
the solicitor general recommending against seeking further appeals
court review. The criminal division attorney said it was ``a
virtual certainty'' the solicitor general would concur with the
recommendation, Walsh's court papers said.
   Walsh complained the attorney general provided no notice he had
decided to file the request for an extension. The Justice
Department and Walsh's office have worked closely on secrecy issues
for three years. In this instance, the Justice Department mailed
Walsh a copy of his request, depriving the independent counsel of
an opportunity to respond before the court acted, the court papers
stated.
   The department's request for the extension was prepared last
Wednesday, the day Justice Department spokesman David Runkel
assured reporters in a memo that ``there are no new developments in
the Fernandez case.''
   Asked on Friday about the discrepancy between his statement and
the department's actions, Runkel said he was unaware that
government lawyers were preparing to file the request for the
extension.
   Walsh said the information Thornburgh seeks to protect ``is
widely known to the public,'' such as the existence of CIA stations
in Latin America.
   The appeals court said in a decision Sept. 29 that Thornburgh's
only recourse in protecting the information is to file an affidavit
which would prohibit its use at Fernandez's trial. Such a step
could lead to dropping the criminal charges against the ex-CIA
officer.

   Marines who marched behind the slogan ``rape,
kill, pillage, burn'' during basic training at Parris Island, S.C.,
this summer are being told their drill instructor recants the use
of the words.
   The flag that carried the saying has been destroyed, Capt. J.R.
Mill, public affairs officer at the training depot, said Monday.
   Mill said the approximately 70 members of the Platoon 1066 all
received a letter from Staff Sgt. B.C. Kirkpatrick.
   ``As your former senior drill instructor in platoon 1066, I
would like to correct a misconception you may have about words
written on our Basic Warrior Training guidon flag,'' said the
letter.
   ``These words, ``Rape, Kill, Pillage and Burn'' were certainly
not an expression of my true beliefs or an official Marine Corps
slogan.''
   The letter, dated Oct. 6, followed a complaint four days earlier
by the mother of one of the recruits who saw the sign in a
graduation photograph of her son's basic training platoon.
   Another sign in the picture showed a naked woman. The signs were
used during marching drills.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., received the mother's complaint and
immediately asked the Marine commandant to investigate.
   McCain said Friday that he was satisfied the corps was reacting
appropriately, but still expected a full report.
   He called the use of the signs a failure in leadership, saying
``it shows a lack of supervision.''
   Mill said the signs were made by and for the platoon under
Kirkpatrick's leadership that graduated in August.
   The letter from Kirkpatrick said, ``Some day, in combat, we may
be confronted with the harsh necessity to kill or destroy, but
glorifying these activities or suggesting that we commit serious
crimes is inappropriate and simply not true.''
   Kirkpatrick advised in his letter that the Marines refer to the
principles taught in their class on ``the law of war.''
   Furthermore, he said, ``A Marine is one who possesses the
highest in military virtues,'' and ``obeys orders, respects his
seniors and strives constantly to be the best in everything he
does.''

<HEAD>Mitchell Says Bush Would Encourage Chemical Weapons Proliferation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says
President Bush is retreating from the U.S. commitment to ban all
chemical weapons production and stockpiling worldwide.
   Mitchell and other Democrats say Bush, in an apparent shift in
position, is embracing a compromise that would permit the United
States to continue producing chemical weapons years after a treaty
banning them is ratified.
   ``Timidity, mixed signals, inconsistent statements _ all of
which is what has been coming from the administration _ could
result in the loss of an historic opportunity to prevent the spread
of chemical arsenals around the world,'' Mitchell, a Maine
Democrat, told the Senate on Monday.
   Mitchell said, ``Unless the president clarifies his position on
this issue _ makes a decision and makes it known _ it is likely
that little progress will be made in negotiations in Geneva toward
achieving the multilateral treaty prohibiting chemical weapons
which the president, ironically, has stated is one of his highest
priorities.''
   One administration arms control expert, who spoke on condition
he not be identified, acknowleged the policy shift ``is going to
cause a little commotion'' in the Geneva negotiations.
   Bush, acting as vice president in 1984, carried to Geneva a
draft text of a treaty proposing that nations signing a chemical
weapons ban cease producing such arms immediately and destroy their
stockpiles over a 10-year period. About 40 nations are taking part
in the talks, which resume in November.
   On Sept. 25, Bush proposed in a speech at the United Nations
that the United States and the Soviet Union cut their existing
chemical stockpiles by 80 percent to spur the Geneva negotiations.
   But Bush has signed a confidential order permitting the Pentagon
to continue producing a new generation of chemical weapons for an
unspecified period of time while older stocks are being destroyed,
according to administration officials who spoke on condition they
not be identified.
   Bush has said the United States is ready to destroy 98 percent
of its chemical weapons stockpiles in the first eight years of a
treaty, provided the Soviet Union does likewise.
   The remaining two percent would be destroyed over the following
two years provided ``all nations ... capable of producing chemical
weapons'' actually do so, a condition many observers believe is
unlikely to be met.
   Mitchell said if accounts of the confidential order are correct,
the order would end up ``encouraging the very proliferation of
chemical weapons which the treaty is intended to prevent'' and
disrupt treaty negotiations.
   ``Time and technology are not standing still,'' Mitchell said.
``The evidence of the past two years is that many of the restraints
_ moral, political and military _ against the use of chemical
weapons are weakening, and the appetite of many nations to possess
these weapons appear to have been whetted.''

<HEAD>Game Plan on Stock Markets Included Distancing From White House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's game plan for trying
to keep last Friday's stock market dip from becoming an avalanche
included distancing the issue from the White House, officials say.
   ``It was not a crisis in any sense of White House involvement,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater after the stock market
rebounded from Friday's 190-point tumble with a 88.3 point gain on
Monday.
   ``We didn't want to say anything that would cause anxiety. The
president said he wasn't worried. Things have worked out,''
Fitzwater continued.
   Still, despite the outward calm evidenced by Bush and his
lieutenants on Monday, there were intensive and frequent
behind-the-scenes consultations beginning Friday among the White
House and other U.S. agencies, Wall Street officials and foreign
allies, sources said.
   With Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady taking the lead for the
administration, a strategy of containment evolved over the weekend
_ an effort to keep the situation from getting any worse and to
profit from missteps made by U.S. officials during the October 1987
market crash.
   Bush, at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., was kept
posted on developments by phone calls through the weekend from
Brady and chief White House economist Michael Boskin, officials
said.
   The evolving strategy was accompanied by a clear early signal by
the Federal Reserve that it would flood the nation's banking system
with money if needed _ as it had done, somewhat belatedly, in the
1987 plunge.
   In fact, the Fed on Monday pumped some $2 billion into the
system, making it easier for banks to continue to provide credit to
hard-pressed brokerage houses and securities firms.
   And, sources said, the strategy also called for closer economic
coordination with the so-called G-7 group of economic allies _
Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Canada and Italy in addition
to the United States _ than took place last time.
   In fact, comments by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III,
now the secretary of state, publicly criticizing Germany for not
doing more to lower interest rates to stimulate its economy on Oct.
18, 1987, were cited by some analysts as one factor in the record
508-point drop the next day.
   This time around, the White House voiced reassuring comments on
the underlying strength of the economy, even when the stock market
appeared to be continuing to fall. Bush asserted ``I'm not
worried'' about an hour after markets opened Monday, at a time when
stock prices were posting an initial plunge.
   Brady chaired the presidential commission which studied the
October 1987 crash and recommended ways for dealing with future
market crashes. Some of his recommendations are now law, including
automatic triggers that suspend trading when price swings exceed a
specified level.
   The administration and some Wall Street analysts credited some
of those reforms with helping put a damper on trading volatility on
Monday.
   White House officials wanted to make sure it was clear Brady was
dealing with the issue, along with the Fed and the SEC, and that it
had not reached a level of crisis where the White House should get
involved.
   Brady himself drove this point home, making an unscheduled
appearance at a White House staff meeting to urge that an upbeat
face be put on the situation and to caution against any suggestion
of a crisis atmosphere.
   Later, asked if there was a master crisis management plan,
presidential spokesman Fitzwater said no, because there wasn't a
crisis. ``Mainly we rely on the Treasury and the Fed and the SEC.
... We have full confidence in their ability to deal with any
situation,'' he said.
   Also, there is a limit to what the government can do to
influence the stock market _ beyond rhetoric and pump-priming by
the Fed or, in extreme cases, an emergency declaration by the
president halting trading.

<HEAD>Former NIH Director Wants Ban on Fetal Tissue Research Ended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former director of the National Institutes
of Health says he is disappointed in the Bush administration's
reported decision to extend a ban on federal financing of medical
experiments using fetal tissue.
   James Wyngaarden, former director of NIH and now in the White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy, had recommended the
ban be lifted.
   ``There are medical opportunities that might be addressed by the
transplantation of fetal tissue,'' he said. ``And I thought one
could decide on the use of fetal tissue without involving the
abortion issue, since in this country that's a legal procedure.''
   Scientists say transplanting fetal tissue into adults may be
effective in treating diabetes and Parkinson's disease.
   But anti-abortion groups have warned the Bush administration
would find itself in the middle of a firestorm of protest if it did
not continue to the ban.
   ``The evidence is clear that if fetal-tissue transplantation
became successful therapy, it would increase abortions,'' said
James Bopp Jr., general counsel for the National Right to Life
Committee.
   ``I would be inconceivable that a pro-life administration would
have the government sponsor research which would lead to an
increase in abortion,'' he said.
   The New York Times reported Monday the administration would
extend the ban that was imposed in March 1988.
   James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the Department of
Health and Human Services, has recommended the ban be continued,
despite conclusions by two federal panels that such research holds
promise for treating diabetes and Parkinson's disease, the
newspaper said.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan was expected to act within a week,
said the Times, which cited no sources for its information.
   Spokesmen for Sullivan and Mason would say only that the issue
was under review in the department.
   HHS imposed the ban 19 months ago while the department reviewed
the issue. In December, two NIH panels studied the question and
recommended the ban be lifted.
   Robert Windom, assistant secretary for health in the Reagan
administration, told the Times he had been prepared to approve
fetal tissue experiments in January, but was instructed by then-HHS
Secretary Otis Bowen to leave the decision to the Bush
administration.
   Bopp said the NIH advisory panel on fetal tissue research was
``stacked'' with people who favored such research. Bopp was one of
four members of that committee who dissented from the
recommendation that the ban be lifted.
   Wyngaarden, who chaired another NIH advisory committee which
appointed Bopp's panel, said Bopp's claims were untrue. ``It was
not a jury-rigged committee,'' he said, adding that some on the
panel were ``wrenched by the abortion issue.'' Wyngaarden's
committee received the fetal tissue advisory panel's report and
concurred, recommending to Windom the ban be lifted.

<TEXT>
   Senate critics of a constitutional amendment
to ban burning the American flag are urging defeat on grounds it
would stifle freedom of speech, but sponsors call it the only
certain protection for the national symbol.
   ``It is the intention of the drafters of this legislation to go
after speech, certain kinds of speech,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
D-Del., said Monday as the Senate began to debate the proposed
amendment.
   Biden said it would allow authorities to ignore ``a well kept
businessman in a three-piece, Brooks Brothers suit who burned the
flag'' while jailing ``a college dropout with long hair and torn
jeans who burned the flag.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said dissent would not be stifled
by a limit on such protest and called for support ``as we seek to
protect our most cherished symbol of democracy from contemptuous
desecration.''
   The measure would authorize federal and state governments to
outlaw burning and other desecration of the flag.
   The Senate confined itself to debating the measure Tuesday and
aimed for a vote later this week. The House would vote on the
amendment after that.
   Even if approved by Congress, it would have to be passed by the
legislatures of 38 states before becoming part of the Constitution.
   Lawmakers sent to President Bush on Thursday a rival measure
that would ban burning or other desecration by simple statute.
   Sponsors of the amendment, however, say the statutory ban could
be ruled unconstitutional on the same grounds as the Texas law
thrown out by the Supreme Court this summer in overturning the
conviction of flag burner Gregory Lee Johnson.
   ``I remain convinced that the bill that passed the Congress last
week will not survive constitutional scrutiny in light of the
Johnson decision,'' said Thurmond. He said there were many ways to
express dissent other than burning flags and ``those avenues should
and will go unimpeded.''
   The bill already sent to Bush was designed to avoid the
constitutional question by simply barring flag desecration
regardless of whether it involved political protest.
   Thse who are opposing the amendment say it would amount to
tampering with the Constitution for political reasons.
   ``What are we going to remember more, the Constitution or a
momentary political poll?'' Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., asked the
Senate.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said lawmakers were being asked
to amend the Bill of Rights ``partly because of concern over the
obnoxious act of a protester who burned the flag but largely
because of an unseemly effort to gain partisan political advantage
from the incident.''
   He said the Texas protester ``committed a despicable act.'' But
he noted President Bush initially seemed to accept the Supreme
Court's decision in the case and only launched a campaign for an
amendment after having lunch with GOP national Chairman Lee Atwater.
   ``The Atwater-Bush amendment will do more violence to the
Constitution than Gregory Lee Johnson could possibly have hoped to
accomplish with his puny act of protest,'' Kennedy said.
   Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., said the Supreme Court ruling was
``a wrongheaded decision'' and said the amendment is needed as
``the surest protection against further acts of desecration.''
   ``It's the only effective way to protect our cherished flag,''
Dixon said.

<HEAD>Drama But Little Evidence in Tape of Mystery Flight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tape of radio transmissions involving pilot
Thomas Root's 800-mile autopilot flight and crash into the Atlantic
Ocean provides some drama but little evidence about the mystery
flight.
   Root made only one reference to trouble with the July 13 flight,
moments before he apparently blacked out for unknown reasons,
according to a tape and transcript released Monday by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The tape also includes an exchange between an air traffic
controller and a military pilot who said he saw Root move in the
cockpit after passing out but then apparently lapse back into
unconsciousness.
   Root's plane fell into the ocean near the Bahamas when it ran
out of gas after a six-hour journey. Root was flying from
Washington, D.C., to Rocky Mount, N.C., when he radioed the first
and only indication of trouble:
   ``Ah, yes, sir, I'm having a little problem up here, having a
little trouble breathing. How, how far am I to Rocky Mount now?''
Root asked at about 45 minutes into the flight.
   The controller, who was not identifed by the FAA, told the
36-year-old pilot he was about 17 minutes away from his destination.
   Root, his voice faltering, gave one last response: ``Ah, ah,
one, three.''
   The tape did little to clear up mysteries surrounding the July
13 crash of the Cessna aircraft piloted by Root, a Washington
communications attorney.
   About a half-hour after Root's last radio contact, a military
pilot sent up to trail the plane reported he could see the pilot
move.
   Root has said he could not explain photographs that appear to
show him turning his head and changes in the plane's sun visor
while he said he was unconscious.
   ``Sir, we're tracking parallel to `one-three yankee' and, ah,
apparently the individual is unconscious. His head is back, his
mike boom is away from his face,'' the military pilot said.
   A few minutes later, he said, however, ``We just saw the
individual move his head forward.''
   The controller asked whether that might have been caused by the
aircraft bouncing around in turbulence.
   ``No, sir, we were relatively stable and it appeared he had
rocked his head forward and then back,'' the military pilot said.
   The tape, which covered communications from air traffic
controllers and other planes during most of the first two hours of
Root's flight, had no further reference to movements by Root. The
Alexandria, Va. resident, has said the first thing he remembers
after blacking out was finding himself in the water.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said military communications after
Root's plane left FAA-controlled airways were not available.
   Root also was treated for a gunshot wound after he was rescued
from the water. He has said the impact of the plane hitting the
water must have discharged a pistol in the cockpit. The gun's maker
said that couldn't have happened, but authorities have offered no
other explanation for the wound.
   No sound of a gunshot is heard on the tape and there is no
reference to a gunshot in the communications.
   Medical tests found no evidence that Root used drugs, suffered
from carbon monoxide poisoning or had a heart problem during the
flight.

<HEAD>Administration Argues Right to Privacy Isn't Right to Die</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants the Supreme
Court to prevent a Missouri couple from removing life support from
their 31-year-old daughter left severely brain damaged in a car
crash.
   In the first ``right to die'' case before the Supreme Court, the
Justice Department sided Monday with the state of Misouri's effort
to stop Nancy Cruzan's parents from ending her life support.
   The Justice Department's friend-of-the-court brief reaffirmed a
narrow doctrine of privacy consistent with its recent filings
attacking Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion.
   The administration is lining up against the American Medical
Assocation and other groups which point out that many legislatures
and a handful of state appeals courts have supported the withdrawal
of life-sustaining treatment in cases such as the one in Missouri.
   In the case before the Supreme Court, Joe and Joyce Cruzan's
contend their ``right of privacy'' protects from state intrusion
their decision to allow doctors to remove a feeding tube implanted
in their daughter's stomach following a 1983 automobile accident
that left the woman brain damaged.
   The brief by Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr urged the high
court to ignore ``abstract notions of a generalized `right to
privacy'' and limit ``the scope of substantive due process to those
interests that have received he sanction of history, tradition, and
law.''
   ``The court should decline petitioner's invitation to extend the
`right of privacy' to cover all types of decisions about medical
treatment and procedures,'' the administration argued.
   The Carterville, Mo., couple contended in a lower court that
their daughter told them ``she didn't want to live'' if faced with
life ``as a vegetable.''
   But the Justice Department defended the Missouri Supreme Court's
4-3 decision that the Cruzan's had not presented ``clear and
convincing'' evidence their daughter would choose to die a death of
slow starvation and dehydration.
   The Missouri court ``reasonably concluded that any error should
be made on the side of life,'' the department said.
   They defended the Missouri court's refusal to consider as
``conclusive evidence'' the Cruzans' statements that their daughter
would not want a life sustained only by a feeding tube.
   ``Human experience unfortunately teaches that, unlike the
petitioner's family, not every family will have the best interests
of the patient at heart,'' the brief said. ``Thus, although it
would be odd for a state rigidly to disregard all evidence from the
patient's family members, it also need not give such evidence
conclusive weight.''
   The view of privacy outlined by the department echoes its recent
arguments for greater limits on abortion.
   The department argues there may be a ``liberty interest'' in
having an abortion but not a ``fundamental right'' to the procedure
that the state has no role in regulating.
   As in abortion, the department said the Constitution ``should be
construed to give the states considerable flexibility in adopting
rules'' about refusing medical treatment to further its ``profound
interest in preserving human life.''
   ``A state plainly has a strong interest in ensuring that any
decision to refuse life-sustaining treatment is made after careful
thought and full consideration of the consequences,'' the Justice
Department said.
   ``A currently incompetent adult, however, is by definition
unable to give careful thought to the life-and-death questions
regarding medical care.''

<HEAD>Navy Study: Chemical Bomb Caused Iowa Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy experts say the explosion on the USS Iowa
that killed 47 sailors was caused by a chemical bomb placed between
gunpowder bags, according to a published report today.
   A study by the Navy described by The Washington Post concluded a
container of fuel, such as hydraulic fluid, put inside a bag with
an oxidizer was the cause of the explosion last April in the
battleship's No. 2 gun turret.
   The Navy's findings were contained in a report given to
congressional investigators, the newspaper said.
   Earlier theories that an electrical device was inserted between
the powder bags have been ruled out by Navy explosive experts, the
paper said.
   In an earlier report, the Navy concluded Clayton Hartwig, a
gunner's mate second class, most likely deliberately caused the
explosion because he was upset about the breakup of a friendship
with one sailor and the rejection by another shipmate of his
homosexual advances.
   The new report says Hartwig may have spread the oxidizer, a
cleaning powder, on steel wool and put the fuel in a plastic vial,
the newspaper said. He then put the substances in a lead foil sack
that fit between two powder bags that were rammed into the breech
of one of the ship's 16-inch guns, according to the report.

   A usually sockless state lawmaker donned a
pair of aquamarine argyles to try to rescue a piece of legislation
his colleagues have held hostage.
   Last week, the Michigan House approved 11 out of the 12 bills in
a package sponsored by Rep. David Honigman, but decided to hold off
on the last one until the Republican wears socks to House sessions
for a full week.
   Honigman, a lawyer, says he never wears socks _ except during
athletic activities _ because his feet get too hot.
   But to try to win passage of a bill that would let growing
neighborhoods buy and preserve open spaces, Honigman agreed to give
up his trademark sockless look last week. However, he delayed
keeping his promise until Monday because he had to buy some socks
first.
   ``I bought quite a few pairs of the most unusual variety,'' he
said, showing off his new argyles.

   Rogers Corp. stopped paying for the street
lights, so some residents of this northeast Connecticut village
want to stop using the company's name for their community.
   ``Many of the older residents feel betrayed,'' said Roger
Fontaine, an 18-year village resident and spokesman for a group
campaigning to go back to the original name, Williamsville.
   That name was changed to Goodyear in the early 1900s after the
Goodyear Tire &amp; Ruber Co. moved into the area. In 1954, Goodyear
moved out, Rogers Corp., which makes synthetic resins, moved in,
and the company's president, Saul Silverstein, asked residents to
change the village's name to Rogers.
   In exchange, Silverstein said he would pay for the village's 22
street lights.
   But last summer, Rogers Corp. officials decided $2,600 a year
was too much to pay for street lights, and the village went dark.
   ``We don't think it's an appropriate way to spend the
shareholders' money,'' said company spokesman William
Schoppenhorst. ``We give to a lot of chrities.''
   Ronald Robinson, head of corporate facilities for Rogers, admits
he wouldn't mind a name change.
   ``Personally, I like the name Williamsville,'' he said.
``Emotionally and aesthetically, Williamsville is a nice name.''

   This western Massachusetts suburb of 26,000
has been calling itself a city for several months, but some
residents say they'd feel more at home in a town.
   ``I moved here 45 years ago from a city. Keep it a town,'' said
one respondent to a poll in the Union-News of the city of
Springfield.
   ``Town sounds friendlier and more successful. City means failure
and financial difficulties,'' a second respondent said.
   ``We aren't a city. You don't see people sleeping in the
streets,'' said a third.
   Agawam residents voted last year to dump the town manager form
of government in favor of a mayor and city council. But the
Union-News took an unscientific mail-in poll and reported Monday
that supporters of reverting to a town outnumbered opponents 233-38.
   But city partisans also held strong opinions:
   ``City denotes adults. Town sounds like kids playing in
school,'' one told the newspaper.
   The Rev. Benjamin T. Lockhart, a retired minister and city
councilor, has proposed a non-binding referendum on the matter.
   ``It's not exactly a burning issue,'' Lockhart said. ``But a lot
of the older folks are just uncomfortable with calling it a city.
When they see city, they think of Springfield.''

   Hundreds of teen-agers who don't want to
dissect a frog have called a hot line run by the mother of a girl
whose biology-class battle turned into a national animal-rights
effort.
   ``Most students who call want to know what their rights are, how
they should talk to their teachers,'' said Pat Graham, mother of
Jenifer Graham, a vegetarian whose moral objection to dissection
led her to court.
   ``I've had students cry to me on the phone. They're often
distraught, especially if they feel they can't talk to their
parents,'' Ms. Graham said Monday. She appeared at a news
conference to spread the word about the toll-free line sponsored by
the Animal Legal Defense Fund.
   The animal rights supporters hope their cause will get a boost
from today's scheduled broadcast of Jenifer's story in ``Frog
Girl,'' on CBS-TV's ``Schoolbreak Special.''
   Jenifer refused to dissect a frog in her sophomore biology class
at Victor Valley High School in Victorville in 1987.
   In the ensuing battle with school officials, she said she had
moral objections to killing animals for research, and maintained
she should be allowed to learn frog anatomy from a model or
computer program.
   The case attracted the attention of animal-rights attorneys, and
eventually, led the Legislature to approve a bill that gives
students in kindergarten through 12th grade the right to refuse to
dissect animals.
   Jenifer graduated and now is a freshman at California State
University, San Bernardino. But she maintains the high school
unfairly lowered her biology grade, and is pressing a federal
lawsuit against the district, seeking to establish a legal right to
refuse to dissect animals.
   The Animal Legal Defense Fund is starting a campaign to inform
more high school and college students about their right to refuse
to dissect animals, and about animal rights in general, executive
director Joyce Tischler said Monday.
   The group offers handbooks on animal rights for students and
teachers, and hopes to get the cooperation of national science
teachers' associations in the distribution of its materials.
   The organization estimates that 5.7 million animals, mostly
frogs, are killed each year for high school and college students to
dissect in classrooms. It advocates alternatives such as videotapes
showing dissections and the use of plastic models of animals and
their insides.
   Mrs. Graham works as project director of the Students Against
Dissection Hotline, taking calls at her home in Victorville, 80
miles northeast of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>KGB Hands Over Wallenberg's Personal Effects to Relatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A KGB official handed over the personal effects of
Raoul Wallenberg to his relatives nearly 45 years after the Swedish
diplomat was arrested by the Soviets in Budapest, and insisted he
had died in jail.
   Soviet officials also for the first time expressed remorse about
the arrest of Wallenberg, who saved tens of thousands of Jews from
Nazi gas chambers during World War II.
   ``The detention of Wallenberg was a tragic mistake,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Monday in a press
briefing.
   Wallenberg's half-sister, Nina Lagergren, received the passport,
driver's license, address book, calendar and cash her half-brother
carried when he was arrested in January 1945.
   ``It was terribly emotional to see his handwriting and his
photograph and his identity papers,'' Ms. Lagergren said.
   Family and friends from the Raoul Wallenberg Association in
Stockholm were in Moscow at the Kremlin's invitation looking for
clues about the fate of the Swedish diplomat, who would be 77 today.
   The move to clarify what has become a diplomatic embarrassment
for the Soviet Union came under the political reforms of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Previous governments attempted to ignore the
case.
   The delegation gave the Soviets a list of reported sightings of
Wallenberg in Soviet prison camps and were to meet with officials
twice more this week, according to Per Anger, head of the
association. He refused to say when and where Wallenberg was last
reported seen.
   But, dashing hopes that the Kremlin might have new information
on Wallenberg's fate, the Soviets clung to their decades-old
assertion that he died of a heart attack in 1947 at Lubyanka, the
KGB prison in Moscow.
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov and his wife, Yelena
Bonner, have made several trips to prison camps in search of
Wallenberg, but never turned up anything.
   Ms. Lagergren, however, said she believes Wallenberg still is in
isolation at a Soviet prison, his identity long covered up.
   ``We are confident that he has been able to survive,'' he said.
   Anger, a colleague of Wallenberg in Hungary, said Kremlin
officials serving now may be genuinely ignorant of Wallenberg's
fate.
   ``We think it's difficult to find people in the gulag,'' he
said, referring to the Soviet prison camp network.
   The only proof of death offered by Vladimir Pirozhkov, deputy
chief of the KGB, and Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Nikiforov
was a doctor's letter reporting the death, which was announced in
1957.
   Pirozhkov told the group Wallenberg's personal effects were
found in KGB headquarters in Lubyanka last month, said Guy von
Dardel, Wallenberg's half-brother.
   Wallenberg's blue diplomatic passport, stamped with the three
crowns of Sweden, shows a square-jawed, balding 32-year-old man.
   It carries all the necessary stamps of Sweden, Hungary and Nazi
Germany to show the University of Michigan graduate had full
diplomatic immunity when he was arrested.
   Anger said the passport proves that Soviet secret police
deliberately violated international law when they charged
Wallenberg with spying after Soviet troops entered Budapest.
   Nikolai Uspensky, chief of the Foreign Ministry's Second
European Department, said the delegation was told that Wallenberg's
remains were cremated and buried in a common grave at Moscow's
Donskoy monastery.
   ``We gave an exhaustive account of the bleak period in our past
history in which Raoul Wallenberg found himself involved,''
Uspensky said. ``It is our hope that this meeting made it possible
to identify all the minor details related to the tragic fate of
Wallenberg.''
   The letter, written by a doctor named Smartsov to the prison
director, said, ``Prisoner Wallenberg suddenly died last night of a
heart attack. Following your directive on personal supervision of
Wallenberg, please give me instructions on ways to dispose of the
body.''
   Wallenberg issued Swedish travel documents to 20,000 Hungarian
Jews slated for Nazi concentration camps. His intervention with
German authorities was credited with winning survival for another
100,000 Jews.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced
back by more than 500 points Tuesday, regaining most of what it had
lost during the previous day's trading.
   Other Asian stock markets also rebounded Tuesday, encouraged by
news of a partial recovery in New York and the revival in Tokyo.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
142.35 yen, up 1.50 yen from Monday's close. It had opened at
141.97 yen.
   Financial centers in the Far East had posted significant
declines Monday, reacting to a plunge on Wall Street Friday that
sent the Dow Jones industrial average down by over 190 points.
   On Tuesday, Tokyo's principal market barometer, the Nikkei Stock
Average, jumped by 527.39 points, or 1.53 percent, to 34,996.08. It
had fallen 647.33 points Monday, at 1.8 percent its largest drop
this year.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said factors affecting the plunge in New York Friday
were totally different from those during the ``Black Monday'' crash
of October 1987, when the Tokyo exchange's main market barometer
fell 15 percent in one day.
   He said there was no reason to fear Friday's plunge would send
stock markets crashing worldwide.
   ``The crash in New York (Friday) was not linked to uneasiness
about funds, as was the crash of Black Monday,'' the dealer said.
   During the crash two years ago, he said, there was a 2 percent
spread between interest on Treasury bills and another key
short-term interest rate which suggested there might be a flight
away from purchasing government bonds.
   But the spread is only 1 percent now, he said.
   The dealer also said good news precipitated Tuesday's stock
market rebound, including the recovery on Wall Street, and
statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the Fed
would engage in necessary intervention to prevent the crash from
expanding.
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro repeated remarks he made
Monday that he wasn't seriously concerned about the impact of
Friday's plunge in New York on Japanese markets.
   ``I don't think markets moved that sharply (this time),'' he
said, speaking at a press conference after a regular Cabinet
meeting.
   Hashimoto also praised coordination between financial
authorities of the Group of Seven nations during the stock crisis.
   Sumio Fukushima, a dealer with Sumitomo Bank, said Tokyo's
foreign exchange market was quiet Tuesday morning.
   ``The only news is that the stock market has rebounded. There
has been nothing else this morning,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge: Meese Associate Sold Influence on White House Back Stairs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced attorney E. Robert Wallach to
six years in prison, saying the close associate of former Attorney
General Edwin Meese III sold his influence on the White House back
stairs in the Wedtech scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen also fined Wallach $250,000 and
ordered him to forfeit $425,000 in illegal payoffs he got from
Wedtech Corp. to influence Meese and other government officials to
help the South Bronx defense contractor win government contracts.
   ``Too much success can bring failure. I am the epitome of that
and I am paying for it,'' Wallach, who has known Meese since they
attended law school together, told Owen during Monday's sentencing.
   A jury convicted Wallach, 55 of San Francisco, on Aug. 8 of
racketeering, two fraud charges and conspiracy to defraud the U.S.
government for his dealings with the now-defunct Wedtech.
   ``The litany of these things, I am sickened to talk about
them,'' the judge told Wallach. He scolded Wallach for selling
``your influence on the back stairs of the White House.''
   Owen also gave prison sentences and stiff fines to Wallach's two
co-defendants, former Meese financial adviser W. Franklyn Chinn and
Chinn's business associate R. Kent London.
   Owen sentenced Chinn, 47, of San Francisco, to three years in
prison and fined him $100,000, and sentenced London, 46, of
Honolulu, to five years in prison and fined him $250,000. The judge
also ordered Chinn and London to forfeit a $1.14 million consulting
fee they received from Wedtech.
   Chinn and London were convicted of racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy and fraud charges stemming from payments Wedtech gave
them.
   Wallach, who would be eligible for parole after serving two
years in prison, was free pending appeal. Lawyers for Chinn and
London also indicated they would appeal.
   Evidence at Wallach's and other Wedtech trials showed that the
one-time small machine shop grew into a multimillion-dollar
military contractor through various bribe schemes.
   Wedtech, which collapsed in 1986, was awarded more than $250
million in no-bid contracts in four years. It became the target of
five state and federal criminal investigations.
   Four former Wedtech executives pleaded guilty to bribe- and
theft-related charges in January 1987 and have testified at several
trials, including a case that resulted in the conviction of Rep.
Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., on racketeering. As Owen held his sentencing
hearing, another jury in the same courthouse was deliberating in a
Wedtech case in which Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., and his wife are
charged with conspiracy, extortion and bribery.
   Wallach's lawyer, Gary Naftalis, urged the judge to sentence his
client to community service. He said Wallach had devoted his life
to helping various causes and was an excellent father.
   Wallach, hired by Wedtech as a consultant, was found to have
defrauded the company and its shareholders of $125,000 in 1983. He
billed that as work for the company's public stock offering, but it
actually was for his efforts to influence Meese and others on
behalf of the company.
   He also was convicted of illegally receiving $300,000 from
Wedtech officials, purportedly for helping the company acquire
shipyards and a Michigan tug-barge system. The jury found the money
was actually a payment in anticipation of Wallach's employment at
the Justice Department, where he could influence Meese and other
officials. Wallach never received a job at the Justice Department.
   Meese, who has not been charged in the Wedtech case, was
President Reagan's counsel before becoming U.S. attorney general.
He resigned as attorney general in July 1988, and an internal
Justice Department report later faulted him for his efforts to help
Wallach.

<HEAD>State Department To Hire Blind Man as Diplomat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blind man who has been trying to join the
State Department for more than a decade will be granted his wish
under the reversal of a policy that dates back to the 18th century.
   Avraham Rabby, of New York City, said in a telephone interview
Monday he learned last Friday that the State Department had
notified Congress of its intention to hire qualified blind people
for the career diplomatic service.
   State Department officials said the decision was based primarily
on technological advances, including optical scanners capable of
``speaking'' written words through a conversion process.
   These advances enable the blind to improve efficiency and limit
the need for readers and other types of outside assistance.
   Another factor contributing to the policy reversal was a federal
law that states that the government cannot disqualify prospective
employees persons because of blindness or other handicaps. It must
also provide ``reasonable accommodations'' to help them overcome
their handicaps.

   A congressional commission says the federal

infant mortality which add up to misery in the lower Mississippi
River region.
   The Lower Mississippi River Delta Development Commission on

region from ``participating as a full partner in America's future.''
   ``In short, the region is not only worth saving, but because of
its location, resources and climate, could make a major
contribution to the rest of the nation and the world,'' the
commission said.

help clean up a burgeoning drug problem in the Disrict of Columbia,
national drug policy director William J. Bennett has failed at his
most important goal, relieving chronic prison overcrowding in the
city, critics say.
   Bennett called the drug problem in the nation's capital ``out of
control,'' in April and pledged an injection of federal aid to
combat the rising tide of drug-related violence.
   But Bennett's efforts have failed to make any discernible dent
in the local drug trade, federal and city officials agree. And
Bennett's campaign has been hampered by bureaucratic roadblocks and
squabbling, leaving his office unable to deliver on crucial
elements of his plan.
   The prisons, which are more crowded than ever, are evidence of
Bennet's biggest failure, critics say.
   ``My problems are worse today than they were six months ago,''
Walter B. Ridley, the District's acting corrections director, told
The Washington Post.
   Ridley's office had been targeted for the most help under
Bennett's plan. ``I can't think of any significant assistance that
we've gotten,'' he said.
   At a news conference scheduled for Thursday, Bennett plans to
release the first of what he promised would be regular progress
reports on the D.C. initiative.

   A 20-year-old student suspected of
being a police spy was tortured and bludgeoned to death and six
militant students were being held in connection with his murder,
police said today.
   The body of Sol In-jong was found Sunday in the student council
office at Seoul's Yonsei University, laid on a folding bed and
wrapped in a brown blanket, police said.
   They said he had been tied to a chair, tortured and beaten to
death.
   A police spokesman, requesting anonymity in keeping with
official practice, said six students reported the killing and
turned themselves in Sunday after confessing to a Roman Catholic
priest.
   Two of the six students allegedly administered the beatings,
police said.
   Korean newspapers called the killing shocking and senseless and
blamed it on the ideological extremism of radical students.
   ``The murder is a terrible lynching which cannot be forgiven,''
said an editorial in today's Dong-a Ilbo newspaper.
   The six students told police that they discovered Sol carried a
fake university identification card after he gained entrance to
their radical student club _ and they suspected him of being a spy
for the national security police, a police spokesman said.
   The six seized Sol at the university library late Saturday and
took him to a club meeting room for interrogation, police said. The
victim's hands and legs were tied to a chair with nylon cord and he
was beaten repeatedly, police said.
   The radicals claimed Sol confessed he worked for the Agency for
National Security Planning and reported regularly on the activities
of radicals at the university, police said.
   Sol was identified as a second-year student at Tongyang
Engineering College in Seoul.
   There was no explanation as to why he carried Yonsei University
identification or joined the radical's club, but police said a full
investigation was under way and an autopsy would be performed.
   Radical students, a small but vocal minority on campuses, have
staged violent protests to demand the overthrow of the Seoul
government and withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based in South
Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   The extremists have little public support because of their
violent tactics. Police and security agents have used undercover
agents in the past to help keep tabs on the radical students'
activity.

<HEAD>Baker Offer's U.S. Assistance to Help Soviet Economic Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH NEFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is ready to offer technical
help to promote Soviet economic reform, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said. But he criticized Moscow for ``disturbing actions''
around the world.
   ``We want perestroika to succeed,'' Baker told the private
Foreign Policy Association on Monday night in the Bush
administration's warmest statement of support so far for Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts at economic, social and
political reform.
   ``The Soviets are entering very, very uncharted waters,
experimenting with markets, competitive enterprises, and realistic
pricing, all of which we take for granted,'' Baker said.
   Washington stands ready to help Moscow with advice on price
reform and the development of a convertible currency, Baker said.
   The Soviets already have consulted top officials such as Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Wayne Angell, a member of the
Fed's Board of Governors, in Moscow on technical problems in
reorganizing their economy.
   But Baker said there would be no free lunch for the Soviets:
Trade ``must be on a straight commercial basis.''
   Baker denied that a more prosperous Soviet Union would be a more
dangerous enemy. He said perestroika _ Gorbachev's economic
restructuring _ ``really can't succeed without more freedom.'' He
said free speech, human rights, and the respect of law were
essential for economic reform.
   Baker tempered his praise by charging that the Soviets were
reluctant to withdraw from regional conflicts.
   He said Soviet arms shipments to Afghanistan and Ethiopia were
surging and had doubled in Cambodia over last year.
   ``These disturbing actions, this seeming preference for military
solutions, may work in the short run to keep a Najibullah or a Hun
Sen or a Mengistu in power,'' Baker said, referring to the
Soviet-backed leaders of Afghanistan, Cambodia and Ethiopia.
   ``In the long run, however, only political solutions based on
national reconciliation can settle these conflicts,'' he added.
   Baker said the Soviets could save billions of dollars by cutting
ties to regional clients.
   Despite the regional tensions, Baker said ``an historic
opportunity'' exists for the superpowers to leave behind ``the ups
and downs of the Cold War.''
   ``The prospects for a lasting improvement in U.S.-Soviet
relations are better than ever before,'' he said, citing Soviet
arms control measures designed to prevent war and Gorbachev's
promises to turn tanks into tractors.
   Baker also offered strong U.S. support for reconciliation
between the two Germanies, saying it was ``time for perestroika and
glasnost to come to East Germany.''
   He made it clear, however, that a reconciled Germany should not
be neutral or eastward leaning, but with the ``people integrated
into the community of democratic European nations'' on the basis of
Western values.

<HEAD>Settlement Talks in Key Abortion Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents in a lawsuit that many believe could be
used by the U.S. Supreme Court to restrict abortions agreed to
continue negotiations that could lead to a settlement and keep the
case from the high court.
   The talks were the first meetings between the parties since the
high court decided in July to consider the case, a lawsuit
challenging an Illinois law that regulates abortion clinics. The
plaintiff, who runs an abortion clinic, has prevailed at the trial
and appeals court levels.
   Abortion-rights supporters contend the standards make the
clinics more expensive to operate, thus pushing the price of
abortion out of reach of poor women.
   In Springfield, meanwhile, a state legislative committee was
scheduled to vote today whether a proposal to restrict abortions
could be considered by the full Assembly.
   A recent draft of the bill would require doctors to determine
the viability of a fetus 20 weeks old or older before performing an
abortion, and require that a second physician be present during
abortions of viable fetuses. It also would bar public employees and
public facilities from direct involvement in abortions.
   State Attorney General Neil Hartigan and public health chief Dr.
Bernard Turnock on Monday met with American Civil Liberties Union
attorney Colleen Connell, who represents clinic operator Dr.
Richard Ragsdale.
   None would comment on the substance of the talks, but they said
they agreed to meet again next week.
   It is one of three cases scheduled for a Supreme Court hearing
this term that anti-abortion forces hope might be used to overturn
Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 landmark ruling legalizing abortion.
   Hartigan, who is defending Illinois in the Ragsdale case but who
personally favors abortion rights, said the settlement talks were
intended to keep the case from the Supreme Court, which is
scheduled to hear arguments in December.
   The attorney general, a Democrat who has announced his intention
to run for governor next year, said he opposes ``the idea of
Illinois being used as a football for ... a much broader decision.''
   ``I don't think there's any question ... that in fact this case
... might be used for something else,'' Hartigan told reporters
Monday.

   A proposed downtown equestrian center has
passed Mayor Vincent Schoemehl's ``smell test.''
   Schoemehl is backing construction of an equestrian arena
intended to make St. Louis a national center for horse shows. The
10,000-seat, $50 million arena would have stables for 1,500 horses.
   To make sure odor would not be a problem, Schoemehl sent two
emissaries to Oklahoma City during the weekend to check out the
Morgan Horse Association show. J. Christopher Grace, executive
director of development, and Kiel Auditorium director Bruce Sommer
prowled the barns during the 900-horse event and came back with a
thumbs up for the project.
   Sommer's advice to the mayor was simple: ventilation and
constant cleaning.
   Sommer said he and Grace prowled the barns and the trailer area,
``the back of the house, so to speak.''
   ``The odor really didn't appear to be a problem at all,'' Sommer
said Monday. ``We were also looking at the overall requirements to
put on a show like that _ traffic, parking, freight and space.''

<HEAD>Student Starts Petition to Whitewash Jimi Hendrix Mural</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIDGEFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school wall mural of legendary
rock guitarist and 1960s counter-culture hero Jimi Hendrix has
become an offensive symbol of drug abuse to a new generation of
students.
   Nearly 100 Ridgefield High School students have signed a
petition aimed at painting over the mural of Hendrix, who died of a
overdose of barbiturates in 1970.
   ``It seems a little hypocritical to have a thing that is such a
symbol of drugs,'' said Jonathan Fulkerson, a high school senior
leading the petition drive to whitewash the mural.
   ``I mentioned it to some people and they said, `Don't bother
with it,' or, `Throw a can of paint on it,' but I thought that
wouldn't be the right thing. I thought I'd see if the
administration feels the same way I do.''
   The 9-year-old mural, drawn from the cover a Hendrix album
titled, ``Crash Landing,'' shows him playing guitar as a robin
flies toward him. Hendrix was known for searing guitar solos that
became the hallmarks of songs like ``Purple Haze'' and ``Foxy
Lady.''
   Hendrix still has fans among the 1980s high school students.
Fulkerson said that, along with the signatures, he has collected
some harassment.
   Fulkerson said some students think the petition drive is
``goofy,'' while others have used harsh language to express
opposition. One of his friends has been threatened with a knife, he
said.
   Fulkerson said he has no plans for something to replace the
mural although a friend suggested using the space for an anti-drug
message.
   Student Council President Tony George said most students most do
not understand why anyone would want the mural removed.
   ``Most people don't understand what all the fuss is about,''
George said. ``I can see why Jon is circulating the petition, but I
don't really agree with it.''
   Assistant Principal Joseph Ellis said that if the students
present a petition, it will be reviewed. He said that some students
are ``creating a controversy where no controversy exists or should
exist.''
   Ellis said the mural should not be removed simply because
Hendrix took drugs and died of an overdose.
   ``A number of kids have spoken to me about this, and they don't
look at him (Hendrix) as a hero,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Rebounds In Second-Largest Rise Of The Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded
strongly today from the previous day's fall as investors reacted to
news that Wall Street had recovered partially from its own sharper
plunge.
   It was the index's second-largest rise this year.
   The recovery in Tokyo led to rallies on stock markets in other
Asian cities, some of which had plunged on Monday after the Dow
Jones industrial average fell by more than 190 points, or 6.9
percent, on Friday.
   Today, Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average jumped by 527.39 points, or
1.53 percent, to 34,996.08. It had fallen 647.33 points on Monday.
   Traders said today's volume was a moderate 650 million shares,
up from Monday's thin 520 million.
   Analysts said investors were encouraged by the recovery on Wall
Street and statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
that the U.S. central bank would intervene to prevent a crash.
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto repeated remarks he
made Monday that he wasn't seriously concerned about the impact of
Friday's plunge in New York on Japanese markets.
   ``I don't think markets moved that sharply (this time),'' he
told a news conference after a regular Cabinet meeting today.
   But Haruhito Ichimura, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities, warned that it was too early to tell whether the New
York market had completely recovered from its fall.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
142.25 yen, up 1.50 yen from Monday's close of 140.75 yen. It
opened at 141.97 yen and ranged between 141.80 and 142.35 yen. The
dollar had plunged 3.25 yen on Monday.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank, said there had
been rumors that Japanese banks again were backing away from a
revised plan for financing a buyout of United Airlines' parent
company. The refusal of banks, mostly Japanese, to commit their
funds to a similar plan last week led to Friday's plunge on Wall
Street.
   But Kinugasa said the rumors did not have a major impact on the
market.
   Elsewhere in Asia today, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, the
market's key indicator of blue chips, was by midday up 3.6 percent
from its close Monday, when it plunged 6.5 percent.
   Share prices on the Securities Exchange of Thailand also
rebounded strongly after a record 42-point fall on Monday.
   In Manila, share prices closed 0.87 percent higher in moderate
trading, and prices on the Taiwan stock exchange posted the largest
one-day gain ever on news of the rapid recoveries of the New York
and Tokyo markets.
   The 410.32-point gain in Taiwan _ 4.23 percent _ followed a drop
of 329.48 points on Monday.
   ``The recovery on Wall Street relieves worries over a worldwide
crash and draws bargain-hunters,'' said one Taiwan broker, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Share prices in Australia and New Zealand rallied as well.
   The All-Ordinaries Index, Australia's main market indicator,
closed 61.6 points, or 3.8 per cent, higher today after a
140.4-point fall on Monday.
   In New Zealand, the Barclays Index gained 117.70 points, or 5.7
per cent, rebounding from an 8.5 percent fall on Monday.

   Hundreds of students yelling ``Yankee
go home'' battled riot police with firebombs and rocks today in at
least two cities to protest President Bush's meeting with President
Roh Tae-woo in Washington.
   About 500 radical students hurling firebombs fought riot police
in front of Seoul's Kunkook University.
   Students threw hundreds of firebombs as a police armored van
with a multiple tear-gas launcher blasted volleys of gas bombs into
the mob of protesters during the hour-long clash.
   Some 200 students battled riot police in a similar demonstration
in the southern city of Chonju at Wonkwang University after they
were blocked from marching into the streets, police said.
   About 300 students took part in a peaceful anti-American protest
at Chosun University in the southern city of Kwangju, they said.
   The protests came as police said six radical students had been
arrested in connection with the brutal torture death of a fellow
student suspected of being a police spy.
   Roh was scheduled to meet today with Bush at the White House.
   The National Police Headquarters said police were on heightened
alert for anti-American protests during Roh's visit to Washington
this week. Security was bolstered at U.S. facilities after an
attack on U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg's residence on Friday.
   During a rally before the fighting in Seoul, a five-foot effigy
of Gregg was torched as students chanted ``Punish Gregg!'' No
arrests or injuries were reported.
   The student militants are calling for Gregg's recall, saying he
helped to support military rule when he was CIA station chief in
Seoul in the 1970s.
   They also demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea and an end to U.S. demands for greater access to South
Korean markets.
   Six radical students climbed over a stone wall to break into the
ambassador's residence on Friday. They hurled homemade bombs at
guards and rampaged through Gregg's home with iron bars, smashing
artwork and windows before being overpowered by police firing tear
gas.
   Gregg and his wife escaped unharmed and left soon afterwards for
Washington to take part in the Roh-Bush talks. Radicals and
dissidents, a small but powerful minority, have little support
because of their violent tactics.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said U.S. officials were conferring
with Korean police to determine how security around U.S. facilities
could be upgraded to prevent future attacks.
   Police said the body of Sol In-jong was found Sunday in the
student council office at Seoul's Yonsei University, laid on a
folding bed and wrapped in a brown blanket.
   Officers said he had been tied to a chair, tortured and beaten
to death.
   A police spokesman, requesting anonymity in keeping with
official practice, said six students reported the killing and
turned themselves in Sunday after confessing to a Roman Catholic
priest.
   Two of the six students allegedly administered the beatings,
police said.
   The six students told police they discovered Sol carried a fake
university identification card after he gained entrance to their
radical student club and they suspected him of being a spy for the
national security police, a police spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   Police say a 56-year-old man was fatally injured
by a turnip hurled from a passing car, and that there have been
nearly two dozen other instances of assault with fruits and
vegetables.
   At an inquest on Monday, Detective Superintendent Graham Howard
said the death of Leslie Merry was being investigated as a murder.
   Merry was hit by a turnip while he was shopping in east London
on July 14. He suffered a punctured lung and a rib was broken in
three places. His condition worsened after he was released from the
hospital two days later. He was readmitted the next day and died on
July 23.
   Dr. David Rouse, a pathologist, testified that Merry died of a
ruptured spleen, caused by the impact of the turnip, and of acute
respiratory failure and chronic pulmonary disease.
   Price said a healthier man might have survived the blow.
   Howard said there have been a number of incidents in east London
in which various fruits and vegetables had been tossed from
speeding vehicles. On April 19, he said, a jogger was hit by a
cabbage.
   ``In many cases where there is no injury the case does not get
reported,'' he said. ``Some of the incidents are undoubtedly
associated with each other and with the unfortunate killing of Mr.
Merry and the injury to a jogger.''
   Howard said the injuries had included a ruptured stomach and
head and facial injuries.
   The coroner, Dr. Harold Price, recorded an open verdict, and the
investigation continues.

   Slurp on a sipper with a slogan
and you've got your hands and lips firmly around a national fad.
   The sipper, a refillable plastic bottle with a drinking straw
fitted into its cap, originated as a handy, no-spill way for
parched athletes to refresh themselves.
   Now, the bottles are being toted by picnickers, commuters, and
others who are helping sipper manufacturers suck up tall profits.
   The Harmony Container Co. of San Bernardino expects to produce
20 million sippers his year, bearing the names and logos of
convenience stores, fast-food restaurants and businesses.
   The demand for sippers spread from the East Coast to the West,
and now ``they're pretty much in every nook and cranny,'' said Bret
Wilson, Harmony's sales manager. He declined to disclose any
financial details.
   Wilson says the promotional drinkware firm with offices in San
Bernardino and St. Louis noticed about 2{ years ago that a squeeze
bottle for sports looked a bit naked: an empty billboard just
waiting for an ad.
   ``The sports bottle has been around for years for athletic
activities. We took the bottle out of the sports market and started
putting catchy logos on it,'' Wilson said. ``We brought it out of
the hands of the sports market and put it in the hands of the
promotional market.''
   Although sports bottle producers generally have stayed out of
the promotional end of the market, Wilson said competitors have
sprung up in the East.
   ``People are even making them in their garage,'' he said. The
bottles have been especially hot items at convenience stores, which
give them catchy names such as ``Main Squeeze'' and often sell them
as part of a deal. At Arco's AM-PM Mini Markets, for instance, the
bottle is sold for 99 cents, with the 49-cent soft drink. Refills
also go for 49 cents
   Sippers also have proven to be popular items for sale at Knott's
Berry Farm in Buena Park, where they carry the amusement park's
logo and sell for $4 each.
   ``It has been quite the rage,'' said Knott's spokesman Robert
Deuel. ``Our purchasing manager told me that the constantly has to
keep an eye on his stock because they move that many.''
   For companies, it's an inexpensive way to advertise, Wilson
said. And convenience stores and fast-food outlets are always
looking for ways to increase fountain sales.
   Why the popularity among consumers?
   ``I think that a lot of people like the sports appeal of it even
if they're not an athlete,'' he said. The bottle also fits in with
a ``commuter society that's always on the move.''
   Sipper popularity hasn't ebbed at Knott's despite the passing of
summer, Deuel said. But Wilson expects sipper sales to go into
hibernation during the winter and then grow again next spring.
   ``We'll see another big year, but beyond that it's hard to
tell,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sentencing Postponed for Actress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sentencing for actress Zsa Zsa
Gabor was delayed for a week after her new attorney claimed she
wasn't properly defended during her trial and the prosecution
recommended 30 days in jail.
   ``We have a miscarriage of justice,'' new defense attorney
Harrison Bull told Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin, who earlier
was sent the prosecution recommendation of 30 days in jail and more
than $17,000 in fines.
   A jury convicted Miss Gabor on Sept. 29 of battery on a police
officer, driving without a valid driver's license and having an
open container of alcohol in her car.
   Bull alleged that the trial attorney, William Graysen,
mishandled the assault case against Miss Gabor and violated canons
of ethics.
   ``We do know Mr. Graysen directly solicited this client. He
guaranteed this client would not go to jail. Those two facts alone,
if proven, would support a denial of due process,'' Bull said
Monday.
   Rubin granted a one-week delay in sentencing, but said he was
not overwhelmed by Bull's argument.
   ``I feel there is a lot of grasping at straws here,'' he said,
adding there was nothing to indicate misconduct by Graysen.
   Rubin said there was no doubt in Miss Gabor's mind that jail was
a possibility if she was convicted. Throughout the trial, the judge
said, ``she made some of the most incredible statements about
incarceration.''
   The judge said he would not allow Miss Gabor to use dilatory
tactics or grandstanding. But he set the Oct. 24 date for
sentencing and a motion for a new trial.
   Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox disagreed with the defense
argument.
   ``I felt the matter should have referred to the defendant's
competence rather than counsel's,'' Fox said. ``The tenor of this
motion appears to be sour grapes.''
   Graysen said in an interview that he expects his defense to be
upheld.
   ``I wish her well. I hope she gets a new trial and that she is
vindicated,'' he added.
   The courtroom developments occurred after Los Angeles County's
top prosecutor castigated the actress for mocking the judicial
system.
   ``She created this situation for herself with her celebrated
mouth. She made her bed and she can lie in it, and that's at Sybil
Brand,'' District Attorney Ira Reiner told reporters, referring to
the women's jail.
   In addition to the jail term, the prosecution sentencing
memorandum sent to the judge sought more than $3,000 in fines and
$14,000 to compensate the Beverly Hills Police Department for its
costs.
   ``This is not some befuddled old lady,'' Reiner said. ``She's as
street-wise as anybody else.''
   Miss Gabor, whose movies include ``Moulin Rouge,'' ``Queen of
Outer Space,'' ``Boys Night Out'' and ``Picture Mommy Dead,'' was
uncharacteristically quiet about Reiner's comments and the jail
prospects.
   ``I don't say anything,'' Miss Gabor said by telephone from her
Bel-Air home.
   Miss Gabor could be sentenced to 18 months in jail for hitting
Officer Paul Kramer. Fox has said she will likely get some type of
public service.
   ``If she is given any form of community service it will be a
farce ... preposterous, an outrage,'' said Reiner, insisting jail
time was necessary to convince citizens that celebrities have no
special privileges.
   The tempestuous Miss Gabor slapped Kramer on June 14 after he
stopped her $215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible. The actress testified
she instinctively struck out after Kramer roughed her up.

   Avraham Rabby seemed to have all the attributes
that make an ideal diplomat _ well-educated, multilingual, with a
lifelong interest in international relations.
   But he couldn't join the Foreign Service because he's blind.
   Now, however, the State Department has reversed a policy dating
from the 18th century that kept blind people out of the diplomatic
corps. Rabby, 47, of Manhattan, said Monday the State Department
offered him an appointment Friday after notifying Congress of the
change.
   Rabby had tried to join the Foreign Service since the Ford
administration and has passed required exams several times since
1985.
   ``The main problem is one of attitudes toward the blindness,''
he said. ``In any situation like that, when you're trying to change
attitudes, sometimes it takes decades but eventually it has to
come. I'm very happy that it's come now.''
   Rabby planned to meet with his lawyer in Washington today after
testifying about his situation before a House subcommittee. He
expected to meet with State Department officials soon to discuss
what post he would receive.
   Department officials said they changed their policy toward the
blind primarily because of technological advances, such as optical
scanners capable of converting and ``speaking'' written words.
   Another factor was a federal law barring the government from
disqualifying prospective employees because of blindness or other
handicaps. It also must provide ``reasonable accommodations'' to
help them overcome their handicaps.
   The department previously insisted on a general exemption from
this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats
must work.
   Last November, department officials agreed their policies were
contradictory, letting blind people take Foreign Service
examinations but denying them jobs.
   Rabby has worked with the National Federation of the Blind for
about 15 years to make the State Department understand ``that
discrimination doesn't make sense.''
   Born in what is now Israel and blind since age 8, Rabby is a
graduate of Oxford University in England with degrees in Spanish
and French and has a master's degree in business administration
from the University of Chicago.
   He is hoping eventually to become a political officer assigned
somewhere like Moscow, London or Tokyo.
   Some department officials have argued against hiring the blind,
contending that most foreign countries lack the facilities
available in this country for helping the blind.
   They also contended that much of diplomacy involves reading the
``body language'' of foreign envoys. Such gestures as winks and
nods form part of the overall message a diplomat must assimilate,
the officials said.
   ``The fact is that a lot of body language, so-called body
language, you can hear as well as see,'' Rabby said. ``Particularly
in negotiating situations, the final decision is what's written on
the page, rather than someone's nod of the head. ...
   ``Blind people serve already in all kinds of professional and
upper management level positions,'' Rabby said. ``Sure there are
problems that crop up that are blindness-related, but there are
ways to get around them.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has rebuked the editor of
Ogonyok and other outspoken journalists, accusing them of acting
against the Communist Party or of seeking his political downfall,
Soviet reporters said today.
   The journalists said the Soviet president's leader's toughly
worded accusations during a top-level conference had sown great
worry in their ranks that the sort of frank criticism spawned by
the Kremlin's policy of glasnost, or greater openness, might again
be ruled off limits.
   If accounts of the meeting are accurate, it would mark an
about-face for Gorbachev, who has permitted extraordinary criticism
on a wide variety of topics while saying freedom of expression
nonetheless has some, so far ill-defined, limits.
   The incident comes as Soviet lawmakers are drafting a new law
spelling out the rights and responsibilities of the Soviet press.
The bill is scheduled to be submitted to Parliament by the end of
the month.
   On Friday, Gorbachev met at party headquarters in Moscow with
leaders from the country's state-run mass media, creative unions
and agencies charged with formulating ideology to discuss
``consolidation of all forces of society for the successful
realization of the tasks of perestroika,'' Tass said.
   The meeting was attended by voting and non-voting members of the
ruling Politburo and members of the party Secretariat, indicating
the party leadership considered it a major policy session. Tass,
the official news agency, said Gorbachev gave a speech, but
official media have not distributed the text.
   Soviet journalists, however, said they were told by their bosses
who attended that Gorbachev tore into some of the brightest stars
of Soviet journalism and popular thought in the glasnost era,
including Ogonyok weekly editor-in-chief Vitaly Korotich, historian
Yuri Afanasyev and reformist economists Gavriil Popov and Nikolai
Shmelev.
   The Soviet leader accused Afanasyev, Popov and Shmelev of
joining with maverick Communist legislator Boris N. Yeltsin to form
``a fascist clique striving for power,'' said the journalists, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gorbachev told the meeting that Afanasyev, the rector of Moscow
Historical Archives Institute and an outspoken member of the Soviet
Congress, should be thrown out of the Communist Party, the
reporters said.
   Korotich was reportedly charged by Gorbachev with violating the
party line by permitting the publication in his trailblazing weekly
of overly radical demands and criticism.
   The reporters said that according to Gorbachev, Korotich had
begged him for mercy and promised to scale back his widely read
weekly. But he only kept that promise for a single issue, Gorbachev
was reported to have told the gathering.
   Gorbachev also reportedly demanded that he been given all
letters critical of him that had been sent to the weekly Arguments
and Facts.
   The tabloid newspaper, using readers' mail, recently calculated
that human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was more popular than
Gorbachev or any other member of the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Gorbachev complained that he had always supported the weekly,
which is printed by the ``Znaniye'' national lecture society.
   The editor of Arguments and Facts, V.A. Starkov, was given an
additional dressing-down during a long meeting with chief party
ideologist Vadim A. Medvedev on Monday, the journalists reported.
   Gorbachev also reportedly called the editorial board of the
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper ``a nest of informal, anti-party
organizations.''
   The paper is published by the Komsomol Young Communist League in
the Soviet capital.
   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment this morning
from those Gorbachev was said to have rebuked. A colleague at the
historical institute said Afanasyev was on a business trip until
Oct. 27, as were several of the editors involved.
   However, the Communist Party daily Sovietskaya Rossiya asked
today that if Afanasyev believes that the official ideology of
Marxism-Leninism is outmoded, ``then isn't it more honest for him
to leave the party?''

   Showers and thunderstorms representing the remnants of Hurricane
Jerry dampened the Midwest early today, and snow fell in Colorado
and Wyoming.
   The remains of the hurricane combined with a cold front crossing
the central United States to bring rain to the lower and middle
Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio Valley. Light rain fell over
parts of West Virginia, Maryland and south-central Pennsylvania.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the central Gulf
Coast into the middle Mississippi Valley and across southern
sections of the lower Ohio Valley Monday evening.
   Thunderstorms in Mississippi spawned a tornado southwest of
Yazoo City on Monday. More widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms developing along the cold front extended from central
Indiana across the lower Great Lakes region and extreme northern
Maine. Other showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered across
Florida and Georgia.
   Snow fell this morning in the higher elevations of Colorado and
Wyoming.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed from the eastern half of
Texas to the southern and middle Atlantic Coast region Monday. More
than a dozen cities reached the record high for the date, including
Atlantic City, N.J., 84, and Baltimore, 84.
   The hot spot in the nation Monday was Beeville, Texas, with a
high of 98 degrees.

<HEAD>Newman Files Antitrust Suit Against HBO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Paul Newman filed a $5.45 million suit
against Home Box Office Inc., claiming the cable television company
undersold his film, ``Fort Apache, The Bronx'' so it could rent out
other HBO features.
   Ronald Rosen, Newman's attorney, said the actor signed with
HBO's subsidiary, Time-Life Productions, to make the 1980 film
about a veteran policeman in New York City.
   The suit filed Monday in federal court alleges breach of
contract and antitrust violations. It seeks $5 million in punitive
damages and $450,000 in alleged lost fees to the actor. It also
seeks an injunction against further ``block-booking'' of ``Fort
Apache.''
   Newman was to receive 15 percent of domestic gross receipts and
12.5 percent of overseas earnings under the contract, Rosen said.
   In 1985, Time-Life Productions licensed ``Fort Apache'' and 192
other films to Procter &amp; Gamble Co. for $50 million, Rosen said.
   The rental fee charged P&amp;G for ``Fort Apache'' was $1 million,
he said, arguing HBO used the film to coerce P&amp;G into taking the
other films, a violation of antitrust laws. Newman maintained the
film's true value through licensing was $4 million.
   ``HBO compelled P&amp;G to artificially allocate a lower license fee
to the film than was economically justified, and artificially
allocated higher license fees to the other 192 motion pictures in
the group,'' Rosen said.
   A call to HBO's New York offices made after business hours
Monday went unanswered.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Police On Strike, 300 Detained</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of policemen went on a 24-hour strike
for higher pay in this violence-plagued capital, and at least one
man was reported killed in a shootout between strikers and a police
patrol.
   More than 300 policemen were detained by their colleagues on
Monday, according to police sources. They were being held at a
police academy south of Lima, the sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   Strikers clashed with officers leaving the downtown police
headquarters to patrol the city. They exchanged punches, fired
pistols into the air and lobbed tear gas grenades at one another,
according to reporters at the scene.
   In a separate clash, one man was reported killed and several
wounded when strikers and working policemen exchanged gunfire. It
was not immediately clear whether the dead man was policeman or a
bystander.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yovera said just 5 percent
of Lima's policemen were on strike, but the sources said as many as
80 percent of lower-level officers were participating.
   The strike, which appeared limited to Lima, came as leftist
rebels stepped up a violent campaign against the government and
private citizens in an attempt to disrupt municipal elections set
for Nov. 12.
   On Monday, three masked men boarded a bus downtown, forced the
driver and passengers off at gunpoint, then burned the bus.
   Yovera said police officers sympathetic to the pro-Cuba Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement were promoting the strike.
   By midday, several hundred on-duty police troopers, wearing ski
masks that covered their faces and armed with automatic rifles,
ringed police headquarters and patrolled the city. The ski masks
were to prevent against reprisals from rebels or striking
colleagues.
   According to some reports, 300 striking policemen occupied the
police compound. But Yovera said on-duty policemen were in control
of the facility.
   In a statement released to reporters, strikers said they were
demanding ``a fair salary'' to compensate for Peru's 3,000 percent
annual inflation and the dangers policemen face in Peru.
   They also want a 48-hour work week, instead of the current 56
hours, and overtime pay. Police earn base pay equivalent to about
$70 a month. The minimum wage in Peru is $40 a month.
   Hundreds of policemen have been killed by guerrillas of the
Mao-inspired Shining Path, a rebel movement that launched an armed
insurgency in 1980.
   The much smaller Tupac Amaru group took up arms in 1984, but in
general has not made policemen a target of attacks.
   In May 1987 policemen went on strike for four days, and the
government led by President Alan Garcia placed Lima under military
control to protect against guerrilla attacks.

<HEAD>Intense Light Can Bind Matter Together</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matter can be held together by intense
light, providing a potentially useful way to craft novel materials,
researchers said.
   The scientists found they could organize randomly arranged
microscopic beads into new structures that lasted as long as they
were bathed in the intense light.
   The practical applications of this observation are still
unclear, although experts said it could play a role in devising new
methods of optical communications or in arranging molecules to make
drugs and other products.
   The study was carried out on tiny plastic beads just 1.43
microns, or 0.000057 inch in diameter. Under the light, they moved
toward each other in hops of 0.387 micron, or 0.000015 inch.
   ``The spheres act like miniature antennas that pick up and then
re-radiate light,'' said Harvard physicist Jene Golovchenko. ``This
scattered light combines with that coming directly from the laser,
giving rise to force fields that bound the small spheres together
in space. The length and strength of the bonding are controlled by
the intensity and wavelength of the laser light.''
   Golovchenko conducted the research with Michael Burns and
Jean-Marc Fournier of the Rowland Institute in Cambridge. It was
published recently in Physical Review Letters.
   The researchers said that until now, the only known way to bind
matter was by atoms exchanging electrons. The newly discovered
process seems to work by exchanging packets of light known as
photons.
   The light-assembled structures fall apart as soon as the laser
is switched off. However, Golovchenko said that light might be used
to align molecules in novel ways, and then they could be made
permanent by freezing or chemical processes.
   The researchers observed the interaction by putting water-soaked
beads between plates of glass and then shining a laser on them.
   ``The spheres did a kind of dance, hopping between bound
states,'' said Golovchenko, producing an interaction that he
believed no one had witnessed before.

   Photographers will fan out across the globe
next month to chronicle mankind's quest for health, gathering
images of sidewalk snakebite healers in Brazil, laser
acupuncturists in China and some of the oldest people alive.
   The seven-day effort, organized by the creator of the ``A Day in
The Life'' series of coffee-table books, will become ``Power to
Heal: Ancient Arts &amp; Modern Medicine.'' The $45 book is scheduled
for publication next fall by Prentice Hall.
   ``It is certainly going to remind some of us doctors why we got
into this business in the first place,'' Dr. Matthew Naythons, a
physician, photojournalist and co-publisher of the book, said
recently.
   Carrying an average of 160 rolls of film, the photographers _
including six Pulitzer Prize winners _ will shoot more than 400,000
pictures in 30 countries from Nov. 12 through Nov. 19. Only 350 of
the pictures will make it into the book.
   Assignments include a ``safe sex'' instructional tribal dance in
the Ivory Coast, witch doctors in Guatemala, Mother Teresa's
hospitals in Calcutta, acupuncture treatment for crack abusers in
New York, a portable hyperbaric chamber in Colorado, Florida fat
farms and the ``ultimate smoker'' _ who still has to be found.
   The book also will feature pictorial chronicles of 20 physicians
around the world making their rounds; the manufacture of plastic
eyes at the oldest eye factory in the United States; and the daily
activities of Bleachman, who combs the streets of San Francisco in
a superhero's costume to teach drug addicts how to sterilize
needles.
   In accompanying texts, centenarians will offer tips on longevity
and journalists will discuss subjects ranging from childbirth to
the future of medicine.
   ``The concept is that in the course of one week around the world
it seems as if you can almost retrace the footsteps of man's
attempts throughout history to heal this machine we all live in,''
said Rick Smolan of Sausalito, who originated the ``Day in the
Life'' series in 1981.
   ``We're trying to show the human side of healing, not just the
blood and guts stuff,'' said the former Time and National
Geographic photographer.
   Sponsors have paid some of the project's $3.5 million cost or
have provided airfare, accommodations, film and computers.
   Previous books in the series include ``A Day in the Life of the
Soviet Union,'' ``A Day in the Life of America,'' and volumes
focusing on Australia, Japan, Canada, Hawaii, Spain, California,
China and Christmas.
   The 10 books have sold 2 million copies, earning about $100
million, according to Smolan.

<TEXT>
   A hospital has suspended use of more
than 150 generic drugs because of the quality scandal in the
industry, a move one pharmaceutical group called the first of its
kind in the nation.
   Officials of the Hospital of St. Raphael said Monday they would
replace 60 percent to 80 percent of the generics the hospital uses
with more expensive brand-name drugs as precaution.
   The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the 30 top-selling
generic drugs because some makers are accused of faking test
results or bribing FDA inspectors to win approval to market
generics.
   ``The allegations were so serious we couldn't in good conscience
wait any longer,'' said Dr. Charles Riordan, St. Raphael's vice
president for medical services.
   The hospital will resume using the generic drugs _ which
generally cost 50 percent to 70 percent less than brand-name
counterparts _ once officials are sure they have been adequately
screened for quality, Riordan said.
   The move was criticized as rash by Jay Molishever, a spokesman
for the New York-based Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association.
He said the suspension was the first of its kind reported to the
industry group.
   ``This is an astounding action on the part of this hospital,''
said Molishever.
   The hospital will continue using generics produced by the makers
of brand-name drugs, and the products of three generic drug
companies it has dealt with for many years, said James J. Cullen,
chief operating officer of the 491-bed teaching hospital.
   ``We are not making a statement against the use of generic drugs
en toto,'' he said.
   St. Raphael's will absorb the cost of the partial switch to
brand name drugs, estimated at $100,000 a year, Cullen said.
However, hospital officials expect to resume using at least some of
the banned generics within the year, he said.
   The hospital will continue to use generics from three makers _
Elkins-Sinn Inc., LyphoMed Inc., and Roxane Laboratories Inc. _
because there hasn't been any indication of irregularities,
officials said.
   St. Raphael's has stopped using 160 to 200 of the approximately
250 generic drugs it stocks, according to Robert Jacovino, the
hospital's pharmacy director.

   Thousands of Tibetan refugees lined the
streets and monks blew traditional horns today to welcome home
their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who returned to his
mountain abode with the Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Dalai Lama arrived in New Delhi earlier, where he was
showered with flowers and presented with silk scarves. The Budhist
monk then traveled to Dharmsala, his Himalayan home-in-exile for
the past 30 years.
   About 5,000 cheering refugees from the 100,000-member Tibetan
community exiled in India lined the 5-mile route from the airport
to the Dalai Lama's mountaintop headquarters.
   The 54-year-old Dalai Lama was traveling in the United States
when he was named winner of the prestigious prize on Oct. 5 for his
non-violent quest to free Tibet from Chinese rule.
   Monks at the Nangyal monastery blew traditional Tibetan horns as
he drove through the town 300 miles north of New Delhi, which is
home to most Tibetan refugees living in India.
   Priests at a local church rang bells as the Dalai Lama's
motorcade passed. Several Western tourists watched, displaying
placards that read, ``Congratulations and Welcome.''
   The Tibetan government-in-exile declared today a public holiday
and announced a public reception later in the day.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising
against the Chinese annexation of his remote Himalayan nation.
Since then, he has continued to advocate non-violence as the only
means to achieve Tibetan independence.
   In recent months, he has dropped demands for complete Tibetan
independence and has proposed that China retain responsibility for
military and foreign policy.
   Beijing insists Tibet has been an integral part of China since
the 13th century. The Chinese government has said it will talk with
the Dalai Lama if he renounces Tibetan independence.
   China has condemned the Nobel award as an insult and
interference in its internal affairs.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet legislative panel, flexing its new
muscles in the revamped Supreme Soviet, rejected a government
proposal on decentralizing economic control as not radical enough,
newspapers reported today.
   The committee decided the government plan on taking away some
economic powers from Moscow and parceling them out to the country's
15 constituent republics ``does not reflect the radical changes in
the Soviet federation,'' said the daily Leninskoye Zamya, or
Lenin's Banner.
   ``Can we talk today about the widening of rights for the
republics? What we need is for each republic to be economically
independent,'' the deputy committee chairman, Valerian Advadze, was
quoted as telling the Supreme Soviet on Monday.
   The legislative commission charged with fostering the economic
development of the country's republics and regions gave the Council
of Ministers, the government organ that presented the proposal,
until Nov. 15 to revise it.
   The Supreme Soviet, which gained new powers under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's overhaul of the Communist Party-dominated
political system, has demonstrated growing confidence in its new
role.
   It voted down several candidates for ministerial posts proposed
by the government, and refused to follow Gorbachev's lead when he
called for a temporary ban on all strikes.
   Instead, it prohibited strikes in several key sectors.
   Today, the legislature took up a draft law on ownership that was
billed as a measure intended to end the state monopoly on property
in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Cleanup Continues After Weak Hurricane</HEAD>

   Crews cleaned up after Hurricane Jerry,
which wielded a brief but deadly blow, causing three deaths and as
much as $8.25 million in damage.
   As the weak hurricane's remnants slipped out of Texas and into
Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday, the Gulf Coast island city of
about 62,000 quickly returned to normal. Crews picked up downed
power lines and trees, and only one school was closed by a power
failure.
   ``We've had much more serious storms,'' Galveston Mayor Jan
Coggeshall said. ``But for the people who did have damage, it was
very serious for them.''
   Jerry, a relatively small hurricane, grew unexpectedly from a
tropical storm to a hurricane early Sunday and roared ashore later
that night with winds gusting to 100 mph.
   As it swept across Galveston Island, Jerry toppled trees and
power lines, tore off roofs and shattered windows in cars and
homes. The hurricane also spawned a half-dozen tornadoes in the
area, but damage generally was confined to roofs and power lines.
   Damage was estimated between $5 million and $8.25 million after
ground and aerial surveys Monday, Ms. Coggeshall said.
   Power was restored Monday for most of about 75,000 Houston
Lighting &amp; Power Co. customers who lost at the height of the storm.
   The hurricane also churned up the Houston Ship Channel,
crumpling four Houston Lighting &amp; Power transmission towers built
to withstand 90 mph winds. Customers were not seriously affected,
but downed wires halted traffic on the ship channel, which likely
would be closed until today, utility spokeswoman Geri Konigsberg
said.
   Three people were killed when a pickup apparently was swept off
Galveston's protective seawall Sunday. The bodies of a 26-year-old
Coast Guardsman and his 2-year-old daughter were found Sunday on
the seawall's rock jetties; the body of a 19-year-old Coast
Guardsman was found Monday.
   Though Jerry barely brushed Louisiana, it stirred up enough
waves to eat away more of the delicate coastline of the barrier
island and popular resort community of Grand Isle. Mayor Andy
Valence said he would request federal and state help to build more
jetties in vulnerable areas.
   ``We're so sensitive, so vulnerable that when the water hits our
very soft sand, it just crumbles and disappears,'' Valence said.
   He said high tides were only about 2.3 feet above normal, but
more than four feet of beach was eroded in some areas.

<HEAD>Newspapers Carry Full Text Of Jiang Speech, Indicating Purge Imminent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-month-old speech by Communist Party chief
Jiang Zemin, published in full for the first time today, reveals
serious splits in the party despite its leaders efforts to appear
unified.
   Jiang acknowledged that many party members supported the crushed
pro-democracy movement and that some high officials still don't
back the party's new hard-line stance.
   He called for a purge of these people, whom he called
opportunists, and for an ideological struggle within the party to
``sweep out the dirt.''
   ``Grasp the opportunity to do serious investigation and cleanup
in order to protect party ranks,'' he urged. ``We must not pause,
or there will be trouble later.''
   Jiang delivered the speech in August to a meeting of party
organization officials, but it was not reported in the official
media until Monday, when the Xinhua News Agency carried brief
excerpts.
   The full text appeared today on the front pages of all national
newspapers.
   It is Jiang's toughest statement since party elders selected him
in June to replace ousted reformist Zhao Ziyang as party general
secretary. Zhao was accused of supporting the spring student-led
pro-democracy protests and ``splitting the party.''
   But Jiang's speech revealed that despite repeated party calls
for members to ``unify their thinking'' and unite around the party
core, serious disunity remains.
   ``In this struggle, even now there are some people who are
watching,'' Jiang said. ``Watching what? To see if there wil be
change. We cannot permit high-ranking officials to sit on the
fence. ... This is opportunism.''
   He said that all fence-sitters with top jobs will be required to
immediately make their stands clear and ``become very
revolutionary,'' or expect to be fired.
   Many moderate officials and Zhao allies remain in government and
party jobs, and the belated publication of Jiang's speech may
signal that the hard-liners have finally gathered enough strength
to begin purging them.
   ``So many party members took to the streets and marched, this is
a serious problem,'' Jiang said. ``I read a bulletin that said a
student party member wanted to march, but the school party
organization would not let him go. He said, `I am a student first,
then a party member, I must go.' ... Such a party member is not
qualified.
   ``Some party members left the party at its moment of danger,
imperiling the party. I think we need not urge such members to
stay. It won't hurt us if we lose a group of them.''
   The pro-democracy movement was crushed June 4 when troops broke
up demonstrations in central Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed
civilians.
   Jiang said the role of the party in workplaces should be
strengthened.
   ``If the party grassroots organizations are dissolved, I think
the party general secretary will become a commander in name only,''
he warned.
   He also said exploiters _ an old word for wealthy private
businessmen _ should be barred from the party.
   He said that one millionaire was allowed to join in recent
years, but, ``Our party is the vanguard of the working class. If we
allow those who don't want to abandon the principle of exploitation
to join, what kind of party will we wind up with?''
   Apparently taking its cue from this speech, the Beijing city
party committee voted over the weekend to bar wealthy businessmen
from its ranks, and to purge all unfit members.

<HEAD>Original Bob's Big Boy Closes After 51 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connoisseurs of American
meat-and-potatoes cuisine mourned as the original Bob's Big Boy
restaurant closed after 51 years.
   The restaurant, which served up its last Big Boy Combo on
Monday, will be demolished and replaced by a mini-mall.
   ``I've eaten thousands of hamburgers here. I've come here all my
life,'' said Ben Trigg, 57, who remembered being at Bob's when it
opened in 1938. Then, he was a hungry 7-year-old whose mother
rewarded him with a hamburger and chocolate shake after clarinet
lessons.
   ``Hey, I grew up at this place,'' said Rodney Herrick, 41. ``I
used to come here in my battleship-gray Plymouth, order a Coke and
fries and wait for girls. Hard to believe it's closing down. This
place is a landmark.''
   Among the mourners was the restaurant's founder, Robert C. Wian,
75.
   ``I feel perfectly lousy about it,'' he said. ``There is a lot
of sentiment tied up in that place. But it's difficult to stand in
the way of progress.''
   Wian sold his car for $350 to buy the 10-seat diner that became
Bob's Big Boy. A few years later, Wian converted it into a drive-in
restaurant but kept the same meat-and-potatoes menu. A hamburger
and a milk shake ``so thick you can eat it with a spoon'' cost 60
cents.
   The formula was a success. Wian eventually created a national
restaurant chain that inspired numerous imitations.
   On Sunday and Monday, Big Boy customers paid their last respects
by slipping into the brown vinyl upholstered booths and ordering
their last Big Boy Combo _ a double cheeseburger, fries and a small
salad drenched in blue cheese or thousand island dressing.
   Outside stood the chain's mascot, a larger-than-life statue of a
chubby boy wearing suspenders. That character, Wian remembers,
originally was sketched on a napkin by a customer drawing a picture
of a boy Wian had hired to clean counters.
   Wian created the double-decker hamburger as a joke to satisfy a
regular customer's desire for something new, and the idea caught on.
   In 1967, Wian sold the chain to Marriott Corp. Citing lackluster
sales, Marriott decided six months ago to sell the original
restaurant property to a shopping center developer.
   The loss of the original Bob's is only the beginning of the end
of the sit-down burger and home-cooking empire.
   By 1991, all Bob's Big Boys will have been converted into
Allie's, named for Alice Marriott, the mother of Marriott chairman
and president J.W. Marriott Jr.
   Instead of double-deck burgers, fries and brownie hot fudge
sundaes, the menu will feature Mexican dishes, pasta salads and
trendy sourdough.
   As tribute to its past, the Glendale restaurant had a
mini-museum near the front counter with Bob's first spatula and
menu enshrined in a glass case. Wian has asked that the museum
artifacts be shipped to his Newport Beach home.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall has
decided to start using ``Afro-American'' in his written opinions.
   ``I spent most of my life trying to get `Negro' spelled with a
capital `N,''' Marshall told The Sun of Baltimore in a telephone
interview Monday. ``By the time I got that done, everyone was using
`black' with a small `b.'''
   Marshall, 81, the first black on the Supreme Court, said he had
never gotten into the habit of using the word ``black,'' preferring
``Negro'' long after others had abandoned it.
   The New York Times today reported he referred to ``Negroes'' in
speaking from the bench last week while questioning a lawyer in a
case concerning juries' racial composition.
   Marshall conceded that the word ``black'' had ``sometimes
slipped into'' opinions. But ``I don't think `black' connotes
anything,'' he told The Sun.
   ``Who is `black?' I've only seen two black people in my life,
and they were both in Africa.''
   Marshall has now decided to use ``Afro-American,'' which he
calls ``the original phrase.'' Some black activists, including the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, recently have advocated use of the term
``African American.''
   Marshall used ``Afro-American'' for the first time Monday, in a
six-page dissent in a death penalty case.
   Asked by the Times whether he expected the other Supreme Court
justices to follow his lead, Marshall said, ``I didn't ask anyone.
It's everone on his own. It's like what the old lady said when she
kissed the cow _ everyone to his own liking.''

<HEAD>Bomb Found on Body After Triple Murder, Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who killed himself after fatally
shooting his former lover and their two children hid a bomb on his
body that could have blown up in the medical examiner's office,
police said today.
   The seven-inch cardboard tube filled with gunpowder was attached
to a ``push detonator,'' said Detective William Brennan. ``All it
has to do is touch against something.''
   Assistant Medical Examiner Bennett G. Preston said he discovered
the bomb as he started to remove clothes from the body of
37-year-old Daniel Wright, who had shot himself in the neck after
setting fire to his former lover's house.
   ``I just reached in and pulled it out,'' he said. ``I thought it
could be just about anything. ... I said, `Looks like we've got a
bomb here.' ... We didn't mess with it.''
   The office's 65 employees were evacuated for two hours until the
bomb squad removed the explosive.
   About 12 hours later, police called the bomb squad to remove
unspecified ``military apparatus'' found in military lockers from
the man's apartment, Brennan said.
   Police said Wright confronted his ex-girlfriend, Agnes Rivera,
29, and several of her relatives in her home Monday morning. He set
off several tear-gas canisters, then began shooting wildly with a
lever-action rifle.
   Ms. Rivera was fatally wounded in the chest, while the relatives
escaped out the front door. Police said Wright then went into an
upstairs bedroom, where he shot his children, ages 7 and 4. He
apparently doused the room with a flammable liquid and ignited it.
   Then he shot himself and collapsed on the bodies of his
children, police said.
   Police said they had not determined a motive behind the attack,
but neighbors and relatives said there had been tension between
Wright and Ms. Rivera.
   ``He was always threatening her,'' said a sobbing Hector Rivera,
who identified himself as Ms. Rivera's uncle. ``He said if they
would ever break up, he would kill her.''
   The house sustained minor damage.

   Fair weather and a new defense of sand
spared South Carolina's hurricane-scarred beaches further damage
from unusually high tides.
   As the cleanup from Hurricane Hugo continued nearly a month
after it struck, there were these other developments:
   _ Officials on Isle of Palms asked a judge to postpone elections
set for Nov. 7.
   _ A spokesman for the National Flood Insurance program said
12,644 Hugo flood claims filed in South Carolina will represent the
program's biggest payoff ever.
   _ Schools reopened Monday for 44,000 youngsters. Pupils built
houses for displaced birds, wrote essays and talked out their
feelings about the storm.
   A high tide of 7.3 feet arrived Monday morning along beaches
flattened by Hugo's 135 mph winds and 17-foot tidal surge last
month. Tides generally run between 5 and 6 feet along South
Carolina's coast.
   ``It was a beautiful day and the ocean was just about flat at
high tide,'' said Folly Beach Mayor Bob Linville. Forecasters had
said the tides could further damage the beaches only if accompanied
by storm-driven winds; winds Monday were only 7 mph under sunny
skies.
   The higher-than-normal tides were caused by an alignment of the
Earth, moon and sun that occurs about once a decade.
   During the last two weeks, crews have been pushing up mounds of
sand along 40 miles of the hardest-hit areas of the coast.
   ``The berms on the beaches performed well. They did exactly what
they were intended to do,'' said Lt. Col. Jim Scott, an engineer
with the Army Corps of Engineers.
   He said in some places the tides breached the berms, but the
water pooled harmlessly behind them.
   At Folly Beach, the tide gently washed over a temporary
replacement road to about 200 homes on the island's east end. As
the tide receded, the road was uncovered and traffic began using it
again.
   Predicted high tides were to drop to 7.2 feet today and then
recede the rest of the week.
   On Isle of Palms, Mayor Carmen R. Bunch and other officials
asked a judge to postpone the election.
   ``It's unconscionable to politic on the island at this time,''
said Ms. Bunch, who had not filed for re-election Monday.
   But critics of her administration _ which came under fire when
it prevented residents from returning to the island while workers
cleaned it up _ claim the delay would illegally extend the
officials' terms.
   ``We have what is tantamount to maternal despotism over there,''
said Edward Guerard, who represented mayoral candidate W.C. Walters
at a preliminary hearing Monday. ``For the city to now say that the
residents can't choose to throw them out is ludicrous.''
   The National Flood Insurance spokesman, Rick Mayson, said Hugo
flood claims will represent ``the biggest payoff in the history of
the program.'' He predicted some property owners would use the cash
to move their buildings back from erosion-prone beaches.
   Schools reopened Monday, but in Charleston County some school
buildings were so badly damaged they will remain closed for months,
during which classes will be held in neighboring schools.

<TEXT>
   The first 120 of more than 1,500 East
German refugees here packed their bags today and prepared to fly
West, and West Germany urged Communist authorities to speed up
processing of the others.
   A Polish LOT Airlines charter plane was scheduled to leave
tonight for Duesseldorf, West Germany, a two-hour flight, carrying
the 120 refugees, a West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   The flight was scheduled in the evening to allow time for an
additional group of East Germans to be released from their
citizenship, diplomatic sources in Warsaw said. Forty-six East
Germans were released from citizenship Monday.
   The flood of East Germans to the West German Embassy continued,
with about 200 people joining their countrymen since Monday. That
brought the total at the compound or in nearby shelters to 1,500.
   A dispute was brewing between Bonn and East Berlin over the
issuing of exit permits, which the refugees need to leave Poland.
East Germany has said it will process 40 to 50 people a day.
   Hans Klein, the chief West German spokesman in Bonn, said his
government had asked East Germany to process larger groups of
refugees but there was no immediate response from East Berlin.
   ``It's obvious that the East Germans do not want to have another
spectacular passage'' of hundreds of refugees, Klein said. He
acknowledged that technical problems could limit the number of
requests processed daily.
   In Warsaw, East German ambassador Juergen van Zwoll said, ``We
are interested in speeding up this operation, but this does not
depend solely on us. Verification in the GDR (East Germany) is
necessary. We cannot allow some murderer to leave, for instance.''
   The exodus from Poland is part of a larger flood of more than
52,000 East Germans who have reached West Germany since Sept. 10,
when Hungary opened its border to Austria. Many also fled in large
groups through West German embassies in Warsaw and Prague,
Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Literature Prize To Be Announced Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The winner of the 1989 Nobel Prize for
literature will be announced on Thursday, the awarding body said
today.
   The Swedish Academy, a 203-year-old institution created to
safeguard the Swedish language and literature, will announce the
winner from its 18th-century headquarters in Stockholm's Old Town.
   Irish poet Seamus Heaney has been the only candidate tipped by
the Swedish media _ by the weekly ``Vi'' magazine. There was also
speculation the prize might go to an East European writer.
   The Academy never discloses a list of nominees. According to
tradition, it keeps the date of the Nobel announcement secret until
a few days before.
   The literature prize is the last of six Nobel prizes to be
awarded this year. The prize is worth about $463,000.
   The 1988 laureate was Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the
first Arabic-language author to receive the prize since it was
first awarded in 1901.
   The award comes as the 18-member Academy has been distracted by
the worst internal dispute in its history, over its response
earlier this year to the Salman Rushdie affair.
   Three members submitted letters of resignation, but the Academy,
whose members are chosen for life, refused to accept them. The
three have boycotted the crucial meetings at which the prize is
discussed and chosen.
   The three protested the Academy's refusal to condemn the death
sentence on Rushdie issued by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
early this year. Khomeini said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in his book
``The Satanic Verses.'' The British author has been in hiding ever
since.
   The Academy issued a statement supporting freedom of speech, but
declined to go further in accordance with its code of avoiding
political issues.
   Sture Allen, the Academy's secretary, said the dispute did not
interfere with the selection of this year's laureate.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II marked the 11th anniversary of his
election as pontiff in fitting fashion _ winging home aboard a
jetliner over the Indian Ocean and with Lebanon and other
destinations on his mind.
   The most-traveled pontiff returned Monday from Mauritius, the
last leg of an Asian pilgrimage that was his 44th foreign tour
since his election to the papacy Oct. 16, 1978.
   Over 10 days, the pope visited South Korea, Indonesia and
Mauritius, spending 58 hours in the air alone.
   John Paul turns 70 in May and showed signs of tiring on the
Asian tour, especially under the wilting tropical sun. His
shoulders slumped at times as he clearly battled fatigue and jet
lag.
   But he was fresh and in good spirits when he briefly addressed
reporters aboard the Air Mauritius Boeing 767 taking him home and
explained why he is a such a frequent flier, having already covered
some 424,000 miles.
   The pope recalled being asked by a seminarian in Indonesia last
week why he travels so extensively.
   Responding, John Paul quoted Christ telling his apostles, ``Go,
teach all nations.''
   The pope said he was also carrying out the Second Vatican
Council's opening to the world, part of the great reform of the
Roman Catholic Church in the 1960s launched by Pope John XXIII.
   John Paul certainly doesn't go as a tourist, having passed up a
look at famed Budhist and Hindu temples in Java on his Indonesian
swing and of the Taj Mahal when he visited India in 1985.
   Foremost in John Paul's travel plans is Lebanon, although no
date has been fixed.
   ``He keeps thinking of a trip, if that could help,'' said
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro. ``The consideration should be
that it will bring results.''
   John Paul has made a series of appeals to the Moslem and
Christian communities for a lasting peace in the country torn by 14
years of civil war.
   Polish-born John Paul began his globetrotting after just three
months in the papacy, flying to Mexico to address the bishops of
Latin America.
   In the works for 1990 are two trips to Africa, where the
Catholic Church is experiencing its fastest growth, and another
visit to Mexico.
   John Paul began his latest tour with a flight for the first time
over the Soviet Union, which he hopes was a prelude to an actual
visit.
   This could be determined by his talks with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev at the Vatican later this year.

   A judge who told a reporter he gave a lighter
sentence to a killer because the victims were homosexuals ``asking
for trouble'' thought the remarks were off the record, his lawyers
argued at a disciplinary hearing.
   State District Judge Jack Hampton confirmed, however, that after
making the remarks in his chambers he told the newspaper reporter,
``Just spell my name right because no one will remember what I've
said in 1990.''
   The confirmation was in a deposition presented at the hearing
Monday by Bill Hornung, an attorney for the State Commission on
Judicial Conduct.
   The commission has accused Hampton of damaging public confidence
in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. The panel could
dismiss the allegations, censure Hampton or urge his removal by a
seven-judge tribunal.
   ``The place the judge expresses his opinion should be from the
bench, not in an impromptu conversation with the press,'' Hornung
said.
   Cliff Hutchinson, an attorney for Hampton, said Dallas Times
Herald courthouse reporter Lori Montgomery had been in Hampton's
chambers more than 100 times and did not make clear she would write
a story about his Dec. 16 comments about the sentencing of murderer
Richard Bednarski, 18.
   ``Ms. Montgomery took advantage of the friendship she cultivated
with Judge Hampton to write a slanted article about the judge,''
Hutchinson said.
   ``I am not on trial here. My work is not on trial. What the
judge said is the issue,'' Ms. Montgomery said after the hearing.
``The judge knew I was conducting an interview on the record.''
   Ms. Montgomery quoted Hampton as saying he gave a 30-year-prison
term to Bednarski, and not a longer sentence, in part because his
two victims were ``queers.'' The judge said they were ``asking for
trouble,'' based on testimony from Bednarski that they were
soliciting sex.
   On the same day Hampton's comments were published in the Times
Herald, he told The Associated Press, ``The victims were
homosexuals. They were out in the homosexual area picking up
teen-age boys. Had they not been out there trying to spread AIDS
around, they'd still be alive today.''
   Hampton, a Republican, later apologized for a ``poor choice of
words'' but has claimed the criticism is politically motivated. He
was out of town Monday on a judicial retreat.
   About 35 gay-rights protesters stood outside the Criminal Courts
Building chanting slogans against Hampton during Monday's hearing.
   Retired Judge Robert R. Murray, who presided over the hearing,
will submit a statement of facts within two weeks to the 11-member
commission.

   British and Argentine diplomats held talks
today aimed at restoring ties severed because of their 1982 war
over the Falkland Islands.
   The first round of the two-day talks was held at the suburban
home of the British charge d'affaires, Ivor Roberts. Wednesday's
session was to be held at the Argentine Embassy residence.
   ``It's too early to say much,'' Argentine Ambassador Lucio
Garcia del Solar said at the end of the three-hour morning session
between five-man delegations. ``But I think it's positive.''
   Britain's U.N. representative and delegation head Crispin
Tickell called the first meeting ``good, interesting and
businesslike.''
   Today's were the first formal talks between the two countries
since an initial encounter in Bern, Switzerland, in March 1984
foundered on the question of sovereignty over the wind-swept
archipelago in the South Atlantic, a British colony since 1892.
   The Madrid talks, announced at the United Nations Aug. 18, were
made possible after President Carlos Menem of Argentina agreed to
drop the insistence of his predecessors that Argentina's claim to
what it calls the Malvinas had to be the first issue considered in
any discussion of normalization.
   The agenda of the talks was not made public, but they were
expected to center on re-establishment of consular ties as well as
air and sea links between the two countries severed because of the
74-day war, which claimed nearly 1,000 lives.
   The Argentines are also expected to seek an end to the
British-imposed 150-mile zone of exclusion around the 200-odd
islands that would permit Argentine fishing boats to operate in the
fish-rich region, which lies above the Argentine continental shelf.
   Spanish diplomatic sources, who are not directly involved in the
talks, said Argentina would most probably call for a reduction in
the 2,000-man British military contingent based in the Falklands
since the end of the war as a pre-condition to restoring consular
relations.
   Indirect relations between the two countries have been handled
through a British interests section at the Swiss Embassy in Buenos
Aires and an Argentine interests section in the Brazilian Embassy
in London.
   The Spanish sources also described Argentina as being ``more in
a hurry'' than Britain to come to an agreement because of the Latin
American nation's pressing need to normalize economic relations
with London and desire to establish closer ties with the 12-member
European Economic Community.
   Last week, Menem pardoned and freed the leaders of the military
junta convicted and jailed under the government of former President
Raul Alfonsin for their role in backing the April 2, 1982, invasion
of the islands that was eventually repelled by a British task force.
   Argentina surrendered on June 14, 1982, but never made a formal
declaration of cessation of hostilities.
   Del Solar has said as far as he is concerned the hostilities are
over and a formal declaration is not necessary because Argentina
and Britain have been carrying on cordial relations since.
   The majority of the 1,800 residents of the islands, whose
economic mainstay is sheep-raising, are descendants of British
sailors.
   In 1964, the issue of sovereignty over the islands came before
the U.N. Committee on Colonization. The following year, the General
Assembly approved a resolution calling on Britain and Argentina to
find a peaceful solution to the dispute.
   Argentine claims to the islands are based on the 1494 Treaty of
Tordesillas by which Spain and Portugal settled conflicts over land
claimed in the New World and on Spanish possession, to which
Argentina succeeded after declaring independence from Spain in 1816.
   British claims are based on continuous and effective occupation
since 1833.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Enforcement Of Citizenship Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge concluded that under a
200-year-old law Vietnamese fishermen living in the United States
are poachers if they don't have U.S. citizenship.
   The citizenship law requires commercial fishing boat owners and
captains to be U.S. citizens.
   Alan Sparer, a lawyer for the Vietnamese Fishermen's Association
and six individual fishermen who challenged the law, said he would
appeal.
   He said 30 to 100 boat owners in northern California would be
put out of work under the ruling, along with their crews.
   The Vietnamese refugees have been granted permanent residence in
the United States while applying for citizenship, a process that
can take seven years. They insist they compete very little with the
rest of the fishing industry.
   The Vietnamese said many were forced to stop fishing and some
were threatened with confiscation of their boats when the Coast
Guard, after years of non-enforcement, started enforcing the law
last November and fining them up to $500.
   They obtained a temporary restraining order against the law
Sept. 27, arguing that the citizenship requirement, passed in the
post-Revolutionary War period to protect the fledgling U.S. fishing
fleet, unconstitutionally deprived resident aliens of their right
to pursue their occupation.
   But U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer ruled Monday that he
had no choice but to find that the Vietnamese fishermen had no
chance of ultimately proving the law unconstitutional.
   ``They have been poaching,'' he said.
   The judge said Congress, out of concern for national security
and domestic commerce, had the authority to pass the law.
   He also said the Vietnamese had been warned about enforcement
for up to five years.
   ``It's not as if the government has suddenly jumped in and come
down with its ax without warning,'' the judge said. ``What these
people have been doing has been unlawful all the time. They have
been able to build up a business because of limited enforcement.''

   A woman was put on 10 years' probation
for the drug overdose death of her 17-month-old son, who had eaten
cocaine left around the house.
   Nealie Beaty, 26, was sentenced Monday after being convicted
last week of third-degree injury to a child in the 1987 death of
Robert Beaty Jr.
   She could have received up to 10 years in prison. The jury found
her innocent of the first-degree charge, which carried a life
sentence.
   ``There are a lot of battles in this war against drugs. I think
this was a losing effort here,'' said prosecutor Dale Summa.
   Mrs. Beaty's husband, Robert, 27, is serving a life sentence on
his first-degree injury-to-a-child conviction.
   The couple's three other children were removed from their
Brazoria home the night the baby died.

   The world body controlling wildlife
trade formally banned ivory sales today despite bitter objections
from southern African countries, which insist their elephant herds
are not endangered.
   A 91-nation plenary session of the Convention on Trade in
Endangered Species, or CITES, approved without vote a compromise
proposal that places elephants on the endangered list but also
creates a panel of experts to consider exemptions.
   Objecting nations have three months to file reservations. That
means they would be allowed to sell ivory to other CITES countries
who file reservations or to more than 60 non-CITES members.
   Zimbabwe took the hardest stand against the ban, and said it
might withdraw completely from the convention.
   ``(Withdrawing) would hurt us a lot,'' said Rowan Martin,
director of research in Zimbabwe's Park and Wildlife Department.
``But it shows how much this means to us.''
   South African delegate Johannes Neethling said the vote punished
those countries that successfully managed their wildlife and
maintained stable elephant herds. He said he expected his
government to file a reservation.
   Earlier, Botswana, Malawi, and Mozambique said they also would
file reservations. They claim they need the proceeds from ivory
sales to maintain successful conservation.
   They were joined by Burundi, which has no elephants left but has
a stockpile of 86 tons of suspect ivory.
   Ivory from elephant tusks is highly valued for its use in the
signature stamps popular in many Asian nations and for jewelry,
piano keys and carvings.
   The plenary session followed a committee vote where the
compromise formula, proposed by Somalia, received the required
two-thirds majority.
   Under the new measure, countries may be granted exemptions from
the ban if they can prove to a special panel of experts that they
maintain stable elephant populations.
   Countries granted exemptions would be allowed to resume limited
ivory trade. But no exemptions are likely to be considered before
the next conference of CITES in 1991.
   The meeting, which ends Friday, also is considering about 300
other emdangered animals and plants. But the focus was on the
African elephant after a continent-wide census suggested the
elephant population had declined from 1.3 million to less than
650,000 in the past decade.

   Rowena Russell has had enough with
those doggone drivers.
   Twice in 14 months, canines left in the cab of pickup trucks
while their owners dashed into the General Store, uphill from her
house, have knocked the vehicles out of gear and sent them
careening into her yard.
   She has asked selectmen to put up a barrier to protect her house.
   ``I'm asking them to do what they think is best so if it happens
again, noone will be killed or injured,'' she said.
   ``It's a bit much,'' agreed Police Chief Gary Wickland after the
latest incident.
   Russell said she was working in her garden Sept. 30 when a
80-pound Labrador retreiver came flying by behind the wheel of
Francis LeDuc's pickup, with Leduc in pursuit on foot.
   The truck zipped backwards across a road, narrowly missing a
tree in her front yard before crashing into the home's steps, she
said.
   ``Instead of putting her in obedience school, we're thinking of
enrolling her in driver's training,'' said Leduc.
   Scott P. Heyl said he's still getting kidded a year after his
part- Pyrenees, part-Labrador dog bumped against the gearshift of
his pickup in front of the General Store.
   ``I went in to grab a soda and both were gone,'' Heyl recalled.
   That time the truck whizzed between two trees and over Russell's
neighbor's lawn before slamming into Russell's car, parked in her
driveway. The dog bailed out through an open window before the
crash.

   El Salvador's conservative government
and leftist rebels opened talks on ending the country's 10-year-old
civil war and immediately reached a deadlock as each side rejected
the other's first proposal.
   Joaquin Villalobos, a leader of the rebel Farabundo National
Liberation Front, said the government's offer amounted to no more
than ``a call for unconditional surrender.''
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, who is heading the government
delegation for the talks that are to last through today, called the
proposal ``serious and responsible.''
   The rebels proposed a series of military, economic, political
and legal reforms directed toward achieving peace and democracy.
   A source close to the rebels said today the proposal includes
removal of top military chiefs who are directing the war. They
include Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Larios; Gen. Juan Rafael
Bustillo, the air force commander, and numerous brigade commanders.
   A copy of the government offer obtained by The Associated Press
calls for the rebels to cease hostilities by Wednesday, demobilize
immediately and organize to participate in elections and the
country's political life.
   The proposal promises only to ``halt military operations without
prejudice that the armed forces carry out their constitutional
duties.''
   It implicitly rejects a rebel proposal for a cease-fire in
exchange for a government promise to undertake wide political and
social reforms, purge the armed forces of rightist officers and
negotiate a permanent end to hostilities.
   ``Basically, the government proposal is to stop the fighting,
without basis or discussion _ simply silence the guns. This is an
absurd, illogical and inflexible scheme,'' Villalobos said.
   Government spokesman Juan Martinez Varela denied the offer was
merely a scheme to get the rebels to lay down their weapons. ``We
are not asking anyone to surrender,'' he said, but refused to
answer further questions.
   This was the second round of talks between the two sides since
President Alfredo Cristiani took office in June for a five-year
term.
   Three separate peace meetings from 1984 to 1987 with his
predecessor, former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, also ended in
deadlock for similar reasons.
   This time, however, both sides appeared eager for an early
cease-fire in the war that has cost more than 70,000 lives, most of
them civilian.
   In last month's first round in Mexico City, with Roman Catholic
Church leaders acting as mediators, the two sides agreed to talks
at 30-day intervals after this round until a peace accord is
reached.
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who won the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize for his efforts to achieve peace in Central America,
opened Monday's meeting at a Roman Catholic parish house in
Moravia, a town six miles northeast of San Jose.
   ``I know that you are going to want to bury that past because
you don't want to be leaving here accomplices in the continuation
of the war, the pain, the tears and the death,'' he said.
   Attending as witnesses on Monday were Salvadoran Catholic
bishops Gregorio Rosa Chavez and Marcos Rene Revelo and the
secretary of the Papal Nuncio's office in San Jose, Monsignor
Vicente Juan Segura.
   Alvaro de Soto of the United Nations and Ricardo Givoje of the
Organization of American States attended as international observers.

   An Israeli military investigation urged that a
colonel in charge of air defenses be reprimanded over his failure
to detect a fighter jet that a defector flew over the border from
Syria last week.
   The Israeli army said Monday that investigators had concluded a
``faulty report and mistaken decision-making process'' in the air
force led to the failure to intercept the Soviet-made MiG-23
fighter jet.
   The Oct. 11 flight into northern Israel caused an uproar here
over possible flaws in the air defense system along the border with
Syria.
   The military team recommended that the colonel who directed air
defenses at the time of the defection be reprimanded. The officer
was not identified.
   Military officials said the air force also was expected to
update its standing orders and procedures related to air
infiltrations.
   One question not answered by the army probe was why the pilot,
Maj. Mohammed Bassam Adel, spent 20 minutes on the ground with no
security officials around after landing at Megiddo, a few minutes'
flight from Haifa, a port city of 250,000.
   Adel, 34, was on a training flight over southern Syria when he
flew into Israel and landed at an airstrip used by crop-dusting
planes. He said he defected in search of freedom and democracy.
   Also Monday, a Beirut newspaper reported that Israel's secret
service used a Druse woman to lure the Syrian air force pilot who
flew the jet.
   Ad-Diyar, a conservative daily based in Christian east Beirut,
said in an unsourced front-page report that a Druse woman, whom it
did not identify, confessed following her arrest that she had been
recruited by Israeli intelligence.
   Ad-Diyar said Israel had been interested in gaining direct
information from a Syrian pilot flying a MiG-23. Syria and Israel
have been in a state of war since Israel's creation in 1948.

   President Bush will veto a bill allowing
federally financed abortions in cases of rape and incest after
giving up efforts to find a compromise, his spokesman said today.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the provision,
part of a spending bill already approved by a House-Senate
conference committee and the full House, would be vetoed once it
wins final Senate approval.
   The White House previously had hinted that a veto was likely.
Today, Fitzwater said it flatly.
   The White House abandoned the bid for a compromise after chief
of staff John Sununu met for a second day Monday with leading
anti-abortion congressmen.
   ``We talked to people on all sides of the issue ... We couldn't
find any flexibility,'' Fitzwater said today.
   Bush earlier had threatened to veto legislation expanding
current law, but last week he said he was seeking ``room for
flexibility'' to avert a veto.
   ``I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' he said Friday.
``I'm not going to change my position any. But let's see how those
negotiations come out.''
   Congressional Democratic leaders have already conceded they do
not have enough votes to override a veto of the measure, which has
already passed the House.
   The efforts to reach a compromise were never given much of a
chance by abortion rights supporters, who won a surprise victory
last week in the House and expressed no willingness to yield their
position.
   Fitzwater acknowledged as much after Sununu met with Reps. Vin
Weber, R-Minn., Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
just as he did on Friday.
   ``I don't think really there was ever much opportunity to get
close,'' Fitzwater said. He said ``senior advisers'' to the
president ``have recommended a veto.''
   Abortion rights supporters warned that a veto will hurt the
Republican party in the context of what some believe is a changing
political climate on the issue.
   ``If he vetos it, it hurts him,'' Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore.,
said earlier Monday. ``It hurts our party. It hurts our
candidates.''
   Packwood said a veto could particularly damage GOP candidates
for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, two states with races this
fall in which the abortion issue has been successfully used by
Democrats who back abortion rights against anti-abortion
Republicans.
   ``He's misjudged badly the sentiment of the public on the issue
of choice,'' Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, said earlier Monday. ``He's going to have to take
his lumps.''
   The language dropping a 10-year-old ban on the use of federal
money for abortions by poor women in cases of rape and incest is
included in a $156.7 billion appropriations bill for the labor and
health and human services departments. Current law allows Medicaid
abortions only when the mother's life is in danger.
   The bill next goes to the Senate for agreement on a separate
provision.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he did not
know when the bill would come to the floor. Senate sources said
Republicans are holding up the bill while they decide on their next
move, and they have told Democrats to expect an attempt to add an
amendment.
   Fitzwater said the talks seeking a compromise included
suggestions that Bush sign the legislation while announcing
government regulations requiring stricter reporting requirements.
Those requirements would be aimed at preventing women from later
claiming they had been victims of rape or incest merely as a way of
obtaining a federally paid abortion.
   Some attempts at compromise centered on defining the time limit
required for reporting rape or incest by the victims seeking an
abortion. The bill only says the victim must ``promptly'' report
the rape or incest to authorities.
   Abortion rights leaders rejected a GOP proposal to set a 48-hour
time limit.
   Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., last week
pleaded with Bush not to veto the legislation, which they said
affected the ``most vulnerable American women.''
   Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research
Council and a former policy adviser in the Reagan administration,
predicted that following a veto, conservatives would try to ``work
out something ... that wouldn't give the right-to-life people
heartburn and at the same time allow the pro-choice groups to claim
some progress.''

   A day after thousands of pro-democracy activists
took to the streets in several cities, East Germany's Communist
Party today promised an ``atmosphere of openness'' to discuss
critical issues.
   The ruling Politburo, facing mounting unrest at home, was
scheduled to hold its regular weekly meeting late today amid
speculation it could determine the political future of hard-line
leader Erich Honecker.
   Neues Deutschland, the party newspaper, pointed out in a
commentary that in recent days it had dealt with ``many critical
questions, constructive suggestions and new starting points.''
   But the paper emphasized the country's communist system will
stay firmly in place, and it left out the growing pro-democracy
opposition movement from a list of discussion partners about
possible reforms.
   ``Everything should be discussed openly, with the exception of
Socialism on German soil,'' the newspaper cautioned its readers.
   ``We are doing this in a matter-of-fact dialogue and in trusting
cooperation, in an atmosphere of openness, honesty and a realistic
estimate of the powers and possibilities,'' the newspaper said.
   Opposition leaders say they are in favor of ``democratic
socialism,'' implementing free elections but also preserving many
of socialism's benefits, such as guaranteed jobs and free medical
care.
   Monday's night's march in Leipzig, the largest single protest in
the nation's 40-year history, put new pressure on the government to
consider reforms.
   For the first time, East Germany's state-run television promptly
reported the protest, saying ``tens of thousands of citizens'' took
part.
   Christoph Wonneberger, the pastor of St. Luke's Lutheran Church
in Leipzig, told West Germany's ZDF television that more than
120,000 people participated in the three-hour march.
   In other protests Monday night, 10,000 people marched through
downtown Dresden and about 3,000 people gathered in an East Berlin
church for a pro-democracy vigil, activists said. West Germany's
ARD television network said today that thousands also marched
Monday night in Magdeburg, Plauen and Halle.
   Protesters in Leipzig carried placards demanding freedom of the
press and free elections. They chanted ``Power to the young
people'' and ``Erich, lead reforms or go to a retirement home.''
   There were reports of scuffles when security forces attempted to
grab banners away from marchers but no reports of arrests.
   More than 70,000 protesters marched unhindered in Leipzig on
Oct. 9. Earlier in the month, police broke up mass demonstrations.
   Honecker, 77, reportedly is under increasing pressure to step
down from within the ruling Communist Party after 18 years in power.
   Pressure has mounted on the aging hard-line leadership in East
Berlin as unrest spreads, there has been a seemingly endless exodus
of tens of thousands of refugees to the West in recent weeks.
   Early this month, East Germany began to be hit by street
protests that have been the most serious since 1953, when Soviet
tanks helped put down a workers' revolt. The new protests were
stirred in part by the anniversary celebrations and the mass
emigration of young, skilled workers disillusioned by the system.
   Most protesters are young, and they insist they want to reform
East Germany rather than flee to the West.
   More than 52,000 East Germans have fled westward since late
July, either over Hungary's open border with Austria or after
seeking refuge in West Germany's embassies in Warsaw, Poland, and
Prague, Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Hunter Charged For Shooting Wandering Moose</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNDERWOOD, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deer hunter pleading self defense was
cited today for killing a moose that had wandered hundreds of miles
from its natural range and startled farmers by ambling through
Iowa's cornfields.
   Michael Scott Wiggins was charged with shooting an animal out of
season _ Iowa has no moose season _ and having a center-fire rifle
in his possession while deer hunting during a muzzle-loading season.
   Each charge carries up to a $100 fine or 30 days in jail, said
Assistant County Attorney Tim Markel. The state also will seek
$1,000 in damages, he said.
   The bull moose was first seen Sept. 22 near Sheldon, in the
state's northwestern corner. It wandered into downtown Cherokee and
many cornfields, startling farmers and attracting spectators. Some
people even took to airplanes to get a better look.
   Wiggins, who turned himself in Sunday, said he encountered the
moose in a soybean field earlier in the day near Underwood, about
10 miles from Council Bluffs, while hunting coyotes, said
Conservation Officer Doug Clayton.
   Wiggins said he shot the animal when it threatened to charge
him, Clayton said.
   The nearest natural habitat of moose is about 400 miles north of
Iowa, in the woods and lakes of northern Minnesota. Only three
others, all bulls, have been reported in Iowa in the last dozen
years.

<HEAD>Oil, Auto Companies to Test Gasoline Against Methanol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil and auto industries, seeking to
influence the outcome of Congress' debate over alternative motor
fuels, today announced a joint program to test the
pollution-cutting benefits of gasoline against methanol.
   Keith McHenry, senior vice president of technology at Amoco
Corp., said the $11 million testing program would provide an
``objective assessment'' of the relative air quality benefits to be
derived from methanol and new formulations of gasoline.
   The joint program, involving the Big Three auto companies and
the 14 largest oil companies, is to begin immediately. A report on
findings is due by next July or August.
   McHenry said too little was known at present about the
emission-reduction potential of methanol and reformulated gasoline
for Congress and the states to make good decisions on policies
aimed at curbing smog caused largely by burning fossil fuels.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the trade organization of the
major oil companies, has vigorously lobbied against methanol and
touted the advantages of gasoline.
   McHenry asserted, however, that the joint study would have ``no
bias.''
   ``We have made no preconceived notions about how our data will
turn out,'' he told a news conference.
   The oil companies have sought to defeat a provision in President
Bush's proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act that would require
the auto companies to make vehicles that run on fuels other than
gasoline, and for the alternative fuels to be available for use by
motorists in the most polluted urban areas by 1995.
   The alternative fuel favored by the administration is methanol,
which currently is not in commercial production. The oil industry,
which sells about 100 billion gallons of gasoline yearly, has
raised safety, economic and environmental questions about methanol,
a form of alcohol.
   McHenry said senior executives of Amoco and General Motors Corp.
met with White House chief of staff John Sununu to inform him of
the joint study, but he said there was no discussion of the
political aspects of alternative fuels.
   ``He said, `Sounds like a good program, go ahead and do it,
we've very interested in the results,''' McHenry quoted Sununu as
saying.
   McHenry said the oil companies and automakers hoped their test
results would be available before Congress passes clean-air
legislation.
   The testing procedures and results are to be reviewed by an
independent advisory committee composed of academic specialists and
federal and state agencies, McHenry said, adding that this would
ensure the outcome was not biased.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge was gunned down today as
he waited on a Medellin street corner for a ride to work, and an
anonymous caller said drug traffickers killed him in retaliation
for extraditions to the United States.
   Courts reportedly were paralyzed in Medellin after the slaying.
Shocked judges conferred with each other and a union encompassing
all Colombia's judges and court employees considered a strike for
better security.
   Police said Judge Hector Jimenez Rodriguez was shot six times by
a passenger on a motorcycle.
   The gunman got off the motorcycle, walked up to Jimenez and shot
him, the Colombian radio chain Caracol quoted witnesses as saying
in Medellin, the base of the country's most notorious cocaine
cartel.
   An anonymous caller to Caracol said the judge was slain by ``The
Extraditables,'' a group of suspected drug traffickers being hunted
for extradition to the United States.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco has extradited four
Colombians to the United States, including three last Saturday,
since a crackdown on drug trafficking began Aug. 19.
   ``The Extraditables'' said in a communique soon after the
crackdown began that they would kill 10 judges for every Colombian
extradited. Jimenez was the first judge killed since the drug sweep
started. It was not immediately known if Jimenez had been involved
in any recent extradition cases.
   There are varying figures on the number of judges that have been
killed in Colombia, but the Justice Ministry says that about 50
judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed since 1982.
   The Association of Judicial Employees says 1,600 of Colombia's
5,000 judges have been threatened with death in the last 12 months.
   The court workers' union held an emergency meeting in Bogota to
decide whether to ask members to strike for better security, an
executive with the union told The Associated Press.
   Court activity in Medellin came to a standstill as judges met
behind closed doors to decide what to do, the union executive said.
He asked to remain anonymous so he would not become a target of
drug traffickers.
   Meanwhile, the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal of Bucaramanga,
heavily damaged by a bomb on Monday, hit the streets with a 16-page
edition today. The newspaper had joined in a condemnation of
cocaine barons.
   There had been doubts that Vanguardia Liberal would be able to
publish today. The paper usually publishes 24 pages each day. Four
employees of the newspaper were killed when a car bomb wrecked its
building in northeastern Colombia.
   The newspaper's publisher blamed drug traffickers for the
bombing in Bucaramanga, a city of 400,000 people 175 miles north of
Bogota.
   Four journalists were assassinated by unidentified gunmen last
week in the cities of Medellin and Monterria.

<HEAD>Study: Child Care Jeopardized by Low Wages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children in child care centers are in jeopardy
because poverty-level wages have fueled ``an alarming rate of
turnover'' of trained teachers, according to a study released today.
   The National Child Care Staffing Study found that teachers are
earning an average hourly wage of $5.35, which provides an annual
income of $9,363 for full-time employment. The 1988 poverty
threshold for a family of three _ the average family size in the
sample _ was $9,431 a year.
   The study said almost three-quarters of the child care teachers
in the study had some college background but earned less than half
as much as comparably educated women and less than one-third as
much as comparably educated men in the work force.
   ``These low wages are fueling an alarming rate of turnover,''
said Marcy Whitebook, head of the Child Care Employee Project and
principal investigator of the study. She said staff turnover jumped
from 15 percent in 1977 to 41 percent last year, nearly tripled in
the last decade.
   ``Instead of centers that promote healthy child development, we
are confronted by programs where children don't know who will be
caring for them from day to day, where they are isolated from
peers, where they lack language competence and miss critical social
development,'' said Rep. George Miller, chairman of the House
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   The House early this month approved a $22.7 billion child care
package that Miller said addresses the problems of salary and
training. Now lawmakers are working out differences between the
House version and one passed by the Senate earlier this year.
   Deborah Phillips, assistant psychology professor at the
University of Virginia and a project investigator, said 227 child
care centers in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Phoenix and Seattle were
examined between February and August 1988. The centers served a
total of more than 16,000 families _ including 53 infants, 97
toddlers and 110 preschoolers _ and employed more than 3,000 staff.
   ``Our study raises serious concerns about the quality of care in
America,'' she said. ``The typical classroom in centers had barely
adequate quality ratings. Better quality centers had higher wages
for teaching staff, lower teaching staff turnover, better educated
and trained staff and more teachers caring for fewer children.''
   Other observations, said Ms. Phillips, were that better quality
centers were more likely to be non-profit and that low- and
high-income children were more likely than middle-income children
to attend centers providing higher quality care.
   Ms. Phillips explained that day care for low-income families
oftentimes is subsidized by the federal government, while
middle-income families must personally pay for the entire expense.
   Carollee Howes, professor at the University of California at Los
Angeles, said the study recommended that child care teacher
salaries be increased to recruit and retain qualified workers, and
that formal education and training be promoted. She said staff
training should be adopted at both the federal and state levels.
   The study, funded with $500,000 by a consortium of foundations
including the Ford Foundation and the Foundation for Child
Development, was endorsed by a number of organizations.
   ``We have known for far too long that the staffing crisis is
strangling the supply and quality of early childhood programs,''
said Barbara Willer of the National Association for the Education
of Young Children. ``The staffing study dramatically supports the
adage, `You get what you pay for'. ''

<HEAD>Soviets Abstain From Vote to Oust Israel, First Time Since '82</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today ended a seven-year
effort to expel Israel from the General Assembly and abstained from
a vote to reject Israel's credentials. Israel was seated by a vote
of 95-37, with 15 abstentions.
   It was the first time since 1982, when Moslem nations first
tried to oust Israel, that the Soviet Union did not vote against
the Jewish state.
   Last year's vote was 95-41, with seven abstentions in the
159-nation General Assembly.
   Speculation had centered on whether the Soviet Union would
change its vote and end opposition to Israel's presence, in a sign
of warming Soviet-Israeli relations and better U.S.-Soviet ties.
   Israeli diplomats had said the Soviet vote would be a test of
its intentions in improving relations with Israel and playing a
significant role in the Middle East peace process.
   General Assembly resolutions are not binding and a vote of the
15-nation Security Council is required to expel a nation or admit a
new member. The assembly, by refusing to accept credentials, can
bar a nation from participating in the work of the assembly, as in
the case of South Africa.
   For the past seven years Arab nations have sought to expel
Israel, claiming it is an international outlaw and defies U.N.
resolutions calling on it to withdraw from occupied Arab lands.
Israel occupied land from Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with Israel during
the 1967 war, but both sides have been improving unofficial
contacts.

   The cricket wars are laying waste to Shanghai
fields, an official newspaper said Tuesday.
   Nearly 1,700 acres of fields have been damaged and 1 million
square feet of city shrubbery trampled by people hunting at night
for bugs to do battle in cricket fighting contests, the China Daily
said, quoting a Shanghai newspaper.
   It said 1,000 people in the city of 12 million make their living
by dealing in crickets, and that at one market, 10,000 crickets are
sold daily for an estimated $54,000 to $81,000.
   A cricket club has been set up and at a recent national cricket
fighting contest, the winner took home the equivalent of $810,
double what a factory worker earns in a year.
   City agriculture and urban management departments have called
for cricket fighting, a popular activity for gambling in many parts
of China, to be banned.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China opened a major aviation show Tuesday, but
the West's embargo on military deals and uncertainty about the
nation's stability kept many foreign exhibitors away.
   Officials said 91 companies from 14 countries have displays at
the five-day exhibition, down from about 260 firms from more than
20 countries at the last one in 1987.
   The United States and other Western nations imposed embargoes on
arms sales to China after the June military crackdown on
pro-democracy dissent, and all military equipment seen on display
was Chinese.
   China, which last year sold an estimated $1.9 billion in arms,
almost all to the Third World, exhibited models of fighter planes,
training jets, missiles and launching systems and booster rockets.
   U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley attended the opening
ceremonies and U.S. companies, including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas,
Lockheed, Allied-Signal and Rockwell, had large displays. British
Aerospace, Airbus Industrie, Dassault, Rolls Royce and Aerospatiale
were also among the major exhibitors.
   Most agreed that sales to China had been affected by the
political turmoil and sharp spending cuts as the government tries
to rein in excessive economic growth and inflation.
   ``China has major problems with foreign exchange and when there
are political uncertainties it's difficult for companies to get
funds,'' said an official of one U.S. company. Business prospects
``have been put back at least a year,'' he said.
   ``There is a tendency for things to slow down,'' said R.L.
Wintringer of Lockheed. But the commitment of the Chinese to expand
their aviation industry is still there, and ``we're going to
stay,'' he said.
   The Civil Aviation Administration of China operates 210 large
and medium-size airliners from 93 domestic airports and plans to
buy 90 jetliners in the next five years, providing major
opportunities for foreign aviation companies.
   ``It's a very competitive market and we've got a presence
here,'' said an official for British Aerospace about his company's
participation in the show. The British firm has already sold 10
medium-range BAE 146s to China.
   The Soviet Union, which is actively seeking more trade with
China following the normalization of bilateral relations this year,
had a large exhibit, including models of planes and helicopters,
instruments, ejection escape systems and even a space suit.
   An official of the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry said his
country is not trying to take advantage of China's strained
relations with the West. ``Our trade will not be at the cost of the
West,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nuns Surrender Over Infected Chickens; Will Switch to Chocolate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Roman Catholic nuns gave up their legal
battle to save their salmonella-infected chicken flock Tuesday,
following a dispute in which they had locked themselves inside the
coop.
   The Mother Superior at Our Lady Of Passion Monastery, Sister
Catherine, conceded the chickens must die. A High Court is
preparing to return its decision on the Ministry of Agriculture's
order to slaughter the birds.
   ``We have just had the ground completely cut out from under our
feet,'' Sister Catherine said. ``But we really accomplished what we
wanted, which was to show that it's just a political thing.''
   The nuns would have had to prove that the decision by Minister
of Agriculture John Gummer was unreasonable or irrational, and
their attorney, Alan Rawley, said the nuns agreed that they could
not meet that test.
   Gummer said the 5,000 laying hens would be destroyed as soon as
possible.
   The nuns, at Our Lady of Passion Monastery in the central
England town of Daventry, 70 miles north of London, challenged the
ministry's order to destroy the egg-laying chickens after tests
revealed they carried salmonella.
   A High Court Judge had granted a reprieve when Sister Catherine,
an 82-year-old native of Kentucky, led a sit-in at the henhouse to
keep out health inspectors and ministry officials.
   The agriculture ministry said tests conducted by the Public
Health Laboratory showed the hens were infected with the same type
and strain of salmonella involved in a July food poisoning outbreak
traced to the nun's flock.
   The nuns said the tests were improperly conducted and that their
eggs posed no health threat.
   The government authorized its veterinarians to close
egg-producing plants and slaughter chickens after a food poisoning
scare earlier this year involving salmonella in eggs.
   Sister Catherine said the nuns had been told by the ministry
that the presence of salmonella meant an end to egg producing. She
estimated the total loss of income at around $32,000 a year.
   The British Egg Producers Association, which is meeting the
nuns' legal costs, said it was pleased that the High Court had
ruled the nuns would be paid the full market price for each of the
slaughtered birds.
   The nuns, who will be allowed to keep one flock of 5,000 birds,
said their next venture will be making chocolate.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television cameras recorded the proceedings of the
House of Commons for the first time on Tuesday as legislators
returned to work from their summer break.
   But the taping by the eight remote-controlled cameras was only a
dress rehearsal to be seen only by legislators and TV program
planners. The nation's TV viewers won't get to see the lawmakers
until Nov. 21 with the official opening of a new session of
Parliament.
   Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe, standing in for Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher who is at the Commonwealth conference in
Kuala Lumpur, was one of the first Commons politicians to be
recorded by the cameras as he responded for the government at
Tuesday's ``question time.''
   At the end of the experimental period next summer, the
legislators in the 650-seat Commons will vote on whether to permit
regular TV screening of their proceedings, or ban the cameras.
   The House of Lords, the more sedate unelected upper chamber of
Parliament, has permitted televising of its proceedings since
January 1985 and viewers have occasionally glimpsed a peer of the
realm soundly asleep.
   But the often rowdy Commons had always refused to admit the TV
cameras until a decision in February 1988, when legislators voted
318-264 to let in the cameras for an experimental period.
   The Commons admitted microphones for radio broadcasts in 1978.
Its refusal to let in TV cameras separated it from other
legislatures around the world, which have allowed such coverage for
years.
   Hoping to discourage rowdy scenes and exhibitionism among
legislators, the House has laid down strict rules about what
Broadcast Communications, the company in charge of the cameras, can
and cannot show.
   If there is a noisy disruption in the Commons, as there often
is, either among legislators on the floor of the House or among
demonstrators in the public gallery, the camera operators have
strict orders to ignore it and focus only on the Speaker, Bernard
Weatherill.
   The cameras will give head-and-shoulders shots of individual
legislators as they speak. Reaction shots are forbidden unless the
person is specifically mentioned by the legislator who is speaking.
   Panning shots of Mrs. Thatcher, opposition Labor leader Neil
Kinnock, and their senior colleagues on the front benches nearest
the Speaker are also banned. Wide-angle shots of the chamber must
be used sparingly.
   Conservative legislator David Harris, a member of the House's
select committee on televising the Commons, said the guidelines
might need to be modified. ``We all need to learn,'' he said.
   Labor legislator Frank Dobson said: ``I think that some of our
customs may appear silly and bizarre and I think if they appear
very silly and very bizarre we will be under pressure to adjust
what we do.''

<HEAD>Anti-Pornography Campaign Backfires, Sales Boom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Headlines in official newspapers Tuesday
proclaimed impressive results: after two months the ``sweep up
pornography'' campaign has netted 30 million books and magazines.
   But on inside pages, several newspapers revealed the details of
how the campaign backfired, in some cases increasing sales of
pornographic books and spreading them among children.
   It seems that in many cities each work unit was given a quota
for turning in pornographic material. Bosses gave their workers
orders: bring in one dirty book apiece.
   Even elementary schools were given quotas, and they sent their
pupils home to rummage through shelves and cupboards for ``yellow
literature,'' the Chinese phrase for pornography.
   Such orders are not unusual: Chinese children are accustomed to
bringing in dead rats during anti-rat campaigns and the masses have
met quotas for killing mosquitoes and swallows.
   But this assignment caused unusual confusion. Economic Reference
News said some students took the order literally and came back with
books printed on yellow paper. Others grabbed calendars with
pictures of female movie stars, or any magazine that had a woman's
picture on the cover.
   Some parents complained that they didn't have any pornography,
but teachers told them to bring in something _ anything _ for the
count, the paper said.
   The newspaper described the assignment as ``preposterous.''
   A reader who wrote to China Youth News agreed. Students at the
middle school in her hometown in eastern China's Jiangxi province
were ordered to bring in two yellow books apiece.
   ``Parents didn't know whether to laugh or cry,'' wrote Long
Ximiao. ``Some parents asked their children to go to the street and
buy pornographic books at high prices. There were so many people
buying pornographic books that the supply fell short of demand and
the prices went up several times each day.
   ``The book sellers were very happy to earn so much money,'' Long
wrote. ``The children ... exchanged the books and read them with
curiosity before they handed them in. It was the talk of the town
for a while.''
   Other problems developed in Dengzhou City in central China's
Henan province, a reader reported in a letter to the Peasants
Daily. He said so many people were drafted into ``sweeping up
pornography'' teams that their ``quality was not too high,'' and
team members were found to be hoarding the confiscated books for
their own use.
   Some even resold them, the reader said, creating new outlets for
yellow literature.
   No such discouraging details have made it into the front-page
reports. The People's Daily praised regional party committees for
taking a leading role in the campaign, and singled out several
provincial party chiefs who personally directed investigations in
their provinces' worst districts.
   It said coastal provinces have clamped down on imports of
pornographic material.
   Official speeches have given the impression that most
pornography comes from outside. Li Ruihuan, the top party leader in
charge of literature and the arts, said in a speech published over
the weekend that ``foreign hostile forces'' were trying to spread
pornography, gambling and drugs inside China to poison the minds of
its citizens and push China toward capitalism.
   Printing or selling pornographic material is punishable with a
three-year prison term, but the law does not define pornography.

   Hundreds of radical students on
Tuesday hurled firebombs at riot police and chanted ``Yankee go
home!'' as they denounced President Bush's meeting in Washington
with President Roh Tae-woo.
   Police fired volleys of tear gas at the 500 students at Seoul's
Kunkook University, where demonstrators burned an effigy of U.S.
Ambassador Donald Gregg and demanded his recall.
   Similar anti-U.S. protests occurred at Wonkwang University in
the southern city of Chonju after police blocked about 200 students
from marching into the streets.
   The students demanded an end to close ties between the United
States and South Korea and to efforts by the United States to open
South Korean markets wider.
   Police reported no arrests or injuries.
   The protests came as police questioned six radical students for
the torture death of a student suspected of being a police spy. The
students surrendered Sunday after confessing to a priest, police
said.
   Police have been on heightened alert since Roh left Sunday for
Washington, with security bolstered at U.S. facilities after an
attack on Gregg's residence on Friday.
   Dissidents and radical students have demanded Gregg's recall,
contending he supported South Korea's military rule when he was CIA
station chief in Seoul in the 1970s.
   Six radical students armed with firebombs and iron bars broke
into the ambassador's residence on Friday and hurled homemade bombs
at guards and smashed artwork and windows before being overpowered
by police.
   Gregg and his wife escaped unhurt and left for Washington to
take part in the Roh-Bush talks Tuesday.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said U.S. officials were conferring
with Korean police to determine how security around U.S. facilities
could be improved to prevent future attacks.

   Voters picking a successor to the late
U.S. Rep. Larkin Smith decided today whether to keep the seat in
GOP hands or give the Democrats Mississippi's entire House
delegation for the first time in 17 years.
   Republican Tom Anderson, 43, long-time chief of staff to U.S.
Sen. Trent Lott, faced Democrat Gene Taylor, a 36-year-old state
senator, in a high-stakes campaign to fill the seat left vacant by
Smith death in a plane crash Aug. 13.
   Lott had held the seat for the Republicans for 16 years before
he went on to the Senate. Smith defeated Taylor for the post last
year.
   The district in the southeastern corner of the state includes
the Gulf Coast and the cities of Biloxi, Gulfport and Hattiesburg.
   The GOP has shown the importance they place on the seat in the
amount of money Anderson has spent, a campaign appearance by
President Bush and Lott's visibility. Anderson spent about $500,000
_ roughly five times what Taylor has spent.
   ``That district is important to us not because it has been in
Republican hands for so long,'' said state Democratic Chairman Ed
Cole. ``That's one of the reasons.
   ``But that district represents the best of what Mississippi has
to offer in that it has the strongest economy, the highest per
capita income, the highest technology base and the greatest
population growth in the last 10 years.''
   A Taylor victory would give Democrats all five of Mississippi's
congressional seats for the first time since 1972. Republicans hold
both Senate seats.
   In the primary Oct. 3, Taylor got 42 percent of the vote and
Anderson 37 percent to advance to today's runoff. Attorney General
Mike Moore, a Democrat, got 21 percent of the vote and was
eliminated.
   Taylor's campaign predicted a victory. Anderson described
himself in recent days as the underdog and took the offensive
recently, criticizing Taylor's legislative record and accusing him
of accepting money from big labor groups.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi today called
for new parliamentary elections next month in which he will face
voters amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption.
   Voting in the world's largest democracy will start Nov. 22 and
continue Nov. 24, chief election commissioner R.V.S. Perisastri
told a news conference. He said subsequent dates would be announced
if two days appear insufficient.
   Gandhi's decision came on the heels of fresh charges of
high-level corruption and his failure to push two constitutional
amendments through Parliament last week. Gandhi took office five
years ago.
   ``By deciding to face the people, the government has been forced
to take the only option available to it,'' said Gandhi's chief
political rival, Vishwanath Pratap Singh.
   Singh is the leader of the Janata Dal, one of five groups
comprising the opposition National Front.
   United News of India and Press Trust of India said Gandhi's
Cabinet decided to set November elections rather than wait for the
constitutional deadline of late December or early January.
   Gandhi and his Congress Party want to turn the election into a
referendum on the constitutional amendments defeated Friday in
Parliament's upper house, the Press Trust said.
   Gandhi said the amendments were designed to give village and
municipal governments more autonomy.
   They fell three votes short of the necessary two-thirds
majority. Opposition parties charged the bills were intended to
consolidate the federal government's power.
   Some analysts said that by pushing power-to-the-people measures,
Gandhi hoped to divert attention from charges that he is presiding
over a corrupt government.
   The 45-year-old prime minister has been dogged for the past two
years by charges that people close to him or his party received
kickbacks paid by the Swedish arms company, AB Bofors.
   Indian newspapers have alleged that Bofors paid as much as $50
million in commissions or kickbacks to secure its 1986 contract to
sell $1.4 billion worth of artillery to India.
   Gandhi has repeatedly denied he profited from the deal, and has
said no Indians received commissions. The Indian press has charged
the money went to companies whose ownerships are largely a mystery.
   At stake are 542 seats in the Lok Sabha, or house of the people,
Parliament's policy-making lower house.
   Gandhi's Congress Party won 415 seats in the last vote, held in
December 1984 two months after his mother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.
   The wave of sympathy that propelled Gandhi to an unprecedented
landslide subsequently eroded with allegations of corruption.
   An August poll published by the respected news magazine India
Today projected Gandhi's party would win only 314 seats this time.
   An opposition victory would mean an end to the Nehru-Gandhi
dynasty that has governed the world's largest democracy for all but
about three years since independence from Britain in 1947.

   A national abortion rights group today removed
Connecticut Gov. William O'Neill from a list of top political
targets for defeat today, reversing a stand the group took just
three days earlier.
   The reversal by the National Abortion Rights Action League took
O'Neill off a list that included Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Florida
Gov. Bob Martinez and six other elected officials as ripe political
targets because of their anti-abortion views.
   ``I have spoken with Gov. O'Neill's office and I have received
assurances that the governor is not planning any anti-choice
initiatives,'' NARAL leader Kate Michelman said in a statement
today.
   ``The governor has stated that regardless of his own personal
views he believes individuals have a right to make their own
decisions. As a result, NARAL is removing him from its list of
elected officials targeted for defeat in 1990.''
   In Hartford, Conn., O'Neill said today he didn't have the
slightest idea how he got on the list in the first place, ``but how
I got off there became self-evident because the local people in the
state of Connecticut knew I shouldn't have been on there to begin
with.''
   Michelman added that her group will be watching all the
candidates in the 1990 race for Connecticut governor and may
``consider involvement'' as the campaign develops. O'Neill, a
Democrat, has said he plans to seek re-election.
   O'Neill's selection to the group's ``NARAL Nine'' drew protests
from NARAL's Connecticut chapter and from the governor's office,
which said that O'Neill, while personally opposed to abortion,
supports abortion rights.
   After discussions Monday between Michelman and O'Neill's chief
of staff, David J. McQuade, the group agreed to issue a press
release removing O'Neill's name from the list.
   ``Short-lived infamy,'' McQuade said after Michelman agreed in a
telephone conversation to remove O'Neill's name from the list and
to announce the move in a press release today.
   Lynn Blackwell, president of the board of the Connecticut NARAL
group, said NARAL's national office never consulted with the board
members of the local chapter about O'Neill's abotion stand. And
despite a NARAL claim that the organization wrote to O'Neill about
his abortion stand, the governor's office had no record of such a
letter.

<HEAD>Romanian Leader Rejects Reforms in Poland, Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu made
his first direct attack on reforms in Poland and Hungary, saying
Romanians ``do not want to become slaves again'' under similar
reforms, a news agency reported Tuesday.
   Speaking at a rally Monday in the northern city of Bistrita,
Ceausescu made clear that under his hard-line policies, Romania
would never change its Stalinist economic and political system.
   For the first time in a public speech, Ceausescu mentioned
Hungary and Poland by name when criticizing their efforts at
market-oriented economic reforms that grant private business some
role in the overall national economy.
   ``I would like to give an answer to some gentlemen who ask:
don't Romanians, too, contemplate to take some measures like those
(adopted) in Hungary and Poland? Don't they, too, think to give up
the development of socialist property and turn to the small
capitalist property?'' the official Agerpres news agency quoted
Ceausescu as saying.
   ``I want to give them an answer ... that we do not think of such
things ... we do not want to become slaves again, neither of the
home capitalists, nor of the capitalists and imperialists abroad,''
he said. ``Let those gentlemen have no illusion and no concern: no
one will ever work for them in Romania.''
   Ceausescu's attack marked an escalation in Romanian criticism of
Soviet bloc reforms following a reported attempt by Bucharest in
August to organize joint Warsaw Pact action to ``defend socialism''
in Poland after the creation of a non-communist government in that
country.
   Romania's centralized economy has brought widespread food and
energy shortages. Most farmland is owned by state collective farms
and the only private farming allowed is in small plots around
farmers' homes. All industrial property is state owned.
   In a rare move probably triggered by growing criticism about
food shortages at home, Ceausescu last week toured poorly stocked
markets in Bucharest and promised better food supplies.
   Observers speculated that Ceausescu's weeklong market tour, the
first such visit since 1982 when the government imposed food
rationing, reflected his concern over recent unofficial calls on
him to step down.
   Ceausescu apparently wants to ensure that no criticism of his
harsh domestic policies surfaces at a Communist party congress to
be held in Bucharest Nov. 20-25.
   In the wake of the visits, however, foreign diplomats in
Bucharest said the markets still were short of meat and other basic
staples, while fruit and vegetables were of poor quality.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoys Take Posts in Australia, New Zealand</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new U.S. ambassadors arrived at
their posts in Australia and New Zealand this week amid debate over
their appointments and the future of U.S. relations with the South
Pacific nations.
   Multimillionaire Florida developer Melvin Sembler arrived
Tuesday in Canberra to take over from Bill Lane, a California
publisher appointed by former President Ronald Reagan.
   On Monday, Della Newman, a Seattle real estate agent who ran
President Bush's election campaign in Washington state, arrived in
New Zealand to take up her post. She replaces Paul Cleveland, who
left in May.
   Mrs. Newman's arrival in Wellington ``comes amid conflicting
signals over the future of American-New Zealand relations,'' said
the Evening Post, the New Zealand capital's only afternoon
newspaper, in an editorial Tuesday.
   ``Mrs. Newman is entitled to a courteous reception but until the
U.S. sees that New Zealand is still a staunch friend, and adjusts
its attitude accordingly, the New Zealand government's welcome
should be measured,'' said the paper, which has a daily circulation
of 90,000 in a city of 200,000 people.
   Sembler has been the subject of lengthy debate in Washington _
which received widespread coverage in Australia _ about political
appointees over career diplomats. Sembler is known to Australians
as a Florida shopping center developer who raised $130,000 for the
Bush campaign.
   He follows a long line of U.S. ambassadors to Australia who
previously worked in non-related jobs such as car salesmen,
publishing and real estate.
   The South Pacific, long perceived as a backwater, has had its
share of world headlines in recent years with general turmoil among
island states and two coups in Fiji, to the bombing of the
Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior by French secret agents in
Auckland, and New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy that led to the
collapse of the ANZUS military alliance and the virtual severing of
its relations with the United States.
   Mrs. Newman, 57, on her arrival pledged to strenghten ties
between the two countries while recognizing major policy
differences.
   ``We cannot ignore the serious differences that have developed
between our governments in recent years regarding ANZUS and nuclear
policy, but we must not allow that to blind us to our many
interests,'' she said.
   Sembler, 58, drew headlines in Australia as ``Bush's $100,000
Man To Get Posting In Australia,'' while Mrs. Newman was reported
as a woman ``experienced in holding parties and functions.''
   An Australian government official said of the appointments that
at least the two countries will ``have the ear of the president.''

   A man who accidentally smothered his baby
daughter, then fatally shot his wife four months later in an
argument over the infant's death has been sentenced to 20 years in
prison.
   Darryl Masheck, 25, of West Haven was sentenced Monday by Judge
Martin Nigro to the maximum term for first-degree manslaughter. He
pleaded guilty in the death of 22-year-old Pansy Masheck, whom he
shot in February, three weeks after they separated.
   Relatives said the baby's death led to the disintegration of the
couple's marriage, and Nigro noted that in the sentencing.
   ``If I were God, I would be able to change everything to the way
it was,'' he said. ``But I'm just here to enforce the law.''
   Masheck accidentally suffocated the couple's 2{-month-old
daughter, Shayla Nicole, on Oct. 12, 1988, as the two slept
together on a couch, according to police and a medical examiner.

<TEXT>
   An artist whose library mural was
forestalled by a canceled federal grant during the Depression says
he's getting ready to complete his painting on the theme, ``Reading
good books is time well spent.''
   The Works Progress Administration, which hired unemployed
artists during the Depression, paid artist Wilfrid Berg $100 to
paint a mural featuring people of the world in native dress, he
recalls. The mural is on a wall in the children's reading room at
Hackley Public Library, but the opposite wall is blank because the
WPA withdrew promised funding in 1934 for a second mural, Berg said.
   Berg, now 81, said he expects to complete the second mural in
time for the library's centennial next year thanks to a private
donation.
   ``Painting has been my life, but I never had the studio or the
space to do the big things I really like to do. That's why I
couldn't resist when I got a chance to do this,'' he said Monday.
   The design for the second mural features characters from classic
children's literature, including Huck Finn, Peter Rabbit,
Cinderella, Rip Van Winkle and Pinocchio.
   The benefactors, Daniel and Shirley Rapoport of Muskegon, would
not disclose the amount of their donation, but Mrs. Rapoport said
it is ``considerably more than what the WPA paid him.''

   A federal jury acquitted a man of biting a

the defendant bent down an kissed the courtroom floor.
   Rolando Dominquez, 40, a native of Nicaragua, was in this
country illegally, according to testimony. He was detained for

   Border Patrol agent Thomas Kilgoar said Dominquez bit him on the
arm and sent him to the hospital. But Dominquez testified that
Kilgoar slapped him in the face and he was acting in self-defense.
   Kilgoar denied he slapped and shoved the man.
   Dominquez testified that he walked out of Nicaragua in 1987 to
Honduras and lived in forests and begged for money to reach this
country.
   When he was stopped at a Mobile bus station, he said he was on
his way to New York.
   Although acquitted Monday of the biting charge, Dominquez
remains in custody and could be deported. His attorney, Domingo
Soto, told U.S. District Judge Charles Butler that his client will

   Sonoma County has come up with a plan
to make casting a ballot as easy as buying a fast-food burger.
   Election officials are opening a drive-through window so
motorists can pull up, sign their names and drop off their marked
ballots.
   The window will shorten the often long lines of early absentee
voters filing into the elections office, said Deputy Registrar of
Voters Janice Atkinson.
   Her idea was approved easily at a recent meeting of the Sonoma
County Board of Supervisors despite some doubters.
   About 10 percent of the 32,000 absentee voters in the county
cast their ballots at the office.
   The plan is expected to take effect after the first of the year,
when the registrar of voters office moves to a new building in the
county government complex.
   The new system, including the ``teller's'' window and drive-up
ramp, is expected to cost $9,100.

<HEAD>House Panel Blocks Action on Abortion Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Illinois House committee today voted
to block further action on abortion restrictions designed to mirror
the Missouri law upheld in July by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The measure fell one vote short of the 10 needed to clear the
House Rules Committee and move to the full House. Nine lawmakers
voted in favor of the measure, eight against.
   Anti-abortion lawmakers have said they might try to bypass the
committee and bring the issue to the House, but some parliamentary
experts have questioned whether that's possible.
   In a brief debate before the vote, anti-abortion lawmakers said
the measure adheres to the guidelines set down by the Supreme
Court, and that it was an emergency.
   ``I ask you, please, to vote `aye' for life,'' said Rep. Penny
Pullen, the bill's sponsor.
   Pro-choice lawmakers argued that the measure was being rushed to
final passage and amounts to ``harassment'' of physicians and women
needing late-term abortions.
   ``Yes, the Supreme Court did say on July 3 that a bill like this
is constitutional,'' said Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie. ``What it
didn't and couldn't say is that a bill like this is sensible.''
   The bill would have required doctors to determine the viability
of a fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or older before performing
an abortion, and mandate the presence of a second physician at
abortions of viable fetuses. It also would bar public employees and
public facilities from direct involvement in abortions.
   Anti-abortion lobbyists voiced hope Monday for a victory, though
they acknowledged that pro-choice movement has gained momentum from
the recent vote by Congress to expand Medicaid funding of abortion
and the defeat of proposed abortion restrictions in Florida.
   Nicholas Stojakovich, lobbyist for the Illinois Pro-Life
Coalition, had said Monday that if the measure failed in committee,
anti-abortion lawmakers might seek another vote later in the week
or try to bypass the committee and bring the issue to the House.
But he called such alternatives ``a long shot at best.''
   ``If it comes to a vote on Tuesday and it's voted down, that
could be the end of it,'' he said.
   The measure before the Rules Committee was introduced last
spring as a legislative vehicle for any new abortion restrictions
permitted by the U.S. Supreme Court.

   Britain's defense minister said today a report had
concluded that Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was not responsible
for the execution of six British commandos in World War II,
although he probably was aware of them.
   The report, commissioned by the Ministry of Defense, also
rejected allegations that Britain was involved in covering up
evidence of Waldheim's activities as a German army officer.
   ``The report indicates that ... Waldheim knew of the capture of
the British servicemen and the possible fate of `commandos' in such
circumstances,'' Defense Minister Archie Hamilton told the House of
Commons.
   ``But no evidence has come to light to indicate that as a junior
staff officer he had the power either to order or to prevent that
fate or indeed to affect the outcome in any way.''
   The government accepted the findings of the research team's
report, he said.
   ``Allegations that records were altered, destroyed or withheld
to protect President Waldheim are shown to be unfounded,'' Hamilton
said. ``He was not wanted by the United Kingdom either as a `top
Nazi' or as a war criminal.''
   Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary general, became the first head
of state to be barred from the United States under a 1987 Justice
Department list. The department said it had evidence that Waldheim
``assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of persons
because of race, religion, national origin or political opinion.''
   The World Jewish Congress, which provided documents for the
British investigation, said in Washington that the documents show
British authorities knew of Waldheim's wartime activities since
1948 but still supported his election as secretary general.
   Waldheim has denied committing atrocities as a Nazi intelligence
officer.
   In Vienna, Britain's ambassador presented a copy of the report
to the Foreign Ministry.
   A statement released by Waldheim's office said: ``The
investigation report ... proves once again that the allegations
against federal president Dr. Kurt Waldheim in connection with his
wartime service are devoid of any foundation in this case too, as
has been the case with previous accusations.''
   Waldheim had been accused of complicity in the murders of the
British troops captured off the Turkish coast in April 1944.
   The British troops were taken to the village of Arsakli near
Salonica, Greece for interrogation at the headquarters of the
intelligence unit of the German Army Group E, where Waldheim was a
junior intelligence officer.
   The six commandos of the Special Boat Squadron refused to talk,
and were later shot by a firing squad in a suburb of Athens. Under
the Geneva Convention it is a crime to kill prisoners of war.
   The ministry's report is based on the work of a 16-member team
which examined British records and documents provided by the United
States, West Germany and Greece.
   An international commission of historians which probed
Waldheim's army career reported in February 1988 that the initial
``W'' was on transcripts of interrogations of the six men.
   However, the commission said it could not prove a connection
between Waldheim and the commandos, though it suggested he knew
they were shot by the Gestapo under a general order by Adolf Hitler
that commandos be executed.
   The fate of the British troops was part of the commission's
inquiry into charges that Waldheim took part in or facilitated
atrocities, including the massacres of some 60,000 Yugoslav
partisans and civilians and the detention of Jews.

   Nearly three out of four Americans, 72 percent,
say there are homeless people in their city, although 40 percent
say they hardly ever see them, according to a nationwide survey
released Tuesday.
   About the same number, or 74 percent, would not object to a
homeless shelter ``two blocks from their own home,'' according to
the survey commissioned by Parents magazine for its November issue.
   Eighty percent of the respondents said homelessness dramatically
symbolizes some of the tragic inequities in American society. Only
14 percent said that since only a small portion of the population
is homeless, it is not really a severe problem.
   Twice as many people said they believe people become homeless
for circumstances largely beyond their control than said
homelessness is due to a person's own negligence or irresponsible
behavior _ 54 percent to 27 percent.
   When asked about the major causes of homelessness:
   _ 49 percent blamed drug and alcohol abuse;
   _ 44 percent, lack of affordable housing;
   _ 31 percent, inequities in our economic system;
   _ 25 percent, mental illness;
   _ 22 percent, bad government policies.
   The telephone interview of 1,000 adults was conducted in late
April and early May by Kane, Parsons and Associates using a
national random sample. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1
percent.

   The Associated Press erroneously reported Oct.
17 that a Navy report concluded that Clayton Hartwig, a gunner's
mate second class, deliberately caused the explosion aboard the USS
Iowa in part because another shipmate rejected his homosexual
advances.
   The Navy report, which concluded that Hartwig was the most
likely person to have caused the explosion, contained no assertion
that he was a homosexual. It painted a picture of him as a person
with few close friends who could have committed suicide because of
the breakup of a friendship with a sailor.

<HEAD>Oil, Auto Industries to Test New Gasolines Against Methanol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The auto and oil industries, faced with
government proposals to replace gasoline with alternative fuels,
said Tuesday they will jointly conduct a scientific runoff to
determine which fuel cuts air pollution most cheaply.
   Final results from the research and testing program are not
expected before next July, but the companies said they hoped data
would be ready in time to influence the outcome of national and
state legislation on promoting alternative fuels.
   Congress is considering a Bush administration proposal requiring
that 1 million alternative fuel cars be sold each year in the nine
most polluted cities by 1997. Both the auto and oil industries have
lobbied against the proposal.
   Tuesday's joint announcement by the Big Three auto companies and
the 14 largest oil companies said their testing program would have
``no bias'' against methanol _ the administration's favored
alternative fuel _ although the oil industry in recent months has
carried out an aggressive public campaign against methanol.
   ``We believe this will be a valid study with no bias,'' said
Keith McHenry, senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp.
He said objectivity will be assured by an advisory panel of
academic and government experts.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the trade association of major
oil companies, has pushed the idea of reformulating gasoline to
achieve pollution reductions. It has repeatedly raised safety,
economic and environmental concerns about methanol.
   Earlier this month the oil group circulated to members of the
news media a 1988 letter from the American Association of Poison
Control Centers asserting that a fullscale conversion to methanol
could trigger big increases in blindness, permanent brain damage
and death due to accidental swallowing of methanol.
   Methanol is not yet in commercial production, although some oil
companies have been studying it for years. It can be produced from
natural gas or coal.
   Unlike gasoline, methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and
nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes
severe smog problems in many cities. Methanol is more expensive,
however, and presents a host of new problems for auto builders
because of its corrosive properties that could damage car parts.
   McHenry said the $11.3 million joint research and testing
program, which is starting immediately, will use 26 different
formulations of gasoline _ all but two of which are experimental
formulas _ plus a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent
gasoline. Phillips Petroleum Co. will do the fuel blending.
   The tests also will evaluate ethanol, or grain alcohol, as an
additive to reformulated gasoline.
   All types of vehicle emissions _ tailpipe exhaust, evaporation
and running losses _ will be measured. The data will then be used
in atmospheric chemistry and air quality models to determine
potential smog reductions from all the tested fuels.
   ``What we're looking for is the most cost-effective way to clean
up the air,'' McHenry said.
   McHenry said that while the White House was informed of the
testing program there were no discussions about its relation to
President Bush's clean air legislation.
   He said senior executives from Amoco and General Motors Corp.
met with White House Chief of Staff John Sununu to brief him on the
program.
   ``He said, `Sounds like a good program, go ahead and do it,
we've very interested in the results,''' McHenry said, adding
later, ``It was not a political discussion.''
   The participating auto companies are GM, Chrysler Corp. and Ford
Motor Co., and the oil companies are Amoco, ARCO, Ashland Oil Inc.,
BP America Inc., Chevron Corp., Conoco Inc., Exxon Corp, Marathon
Oil Co., Mobil Corp., Phillips, Shell Oil Co., Sun Co. Inc., Texaco
Inc. and Unocal Corp.

<HEAD>Industrial Production Shows Continued Manufacturing Weakness</HEAD>

   Industrial production dipped 0.1 percent in
September, the first drop in six months, the government said
Tuesday in a report that reflected continued weakness in the
manufacturing sector of the economy.
   But Michael Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
forecasting firm, said that ``while the economy is not strong,
there's no sign of a downturn.''
   The Federal Reserve said last month's decline in output was the
first since a 0.2 percent drop last February. It followed a revised
gain of 0.3 percent in August and an unchanged rate in July.
   Indications of the coming dip were contained in a Labor
Department report earlier this month that said manufacturers
reported a September loss of 103,000 jobs, including 33,000 at auto
plants. It was the biggest drop since November 1982, at the end of
the last recession.
   ``The most significant declines occurred in the output of
trucks, basic metals and construction supplies,'' the Fed said
Tuesday. ``The decline in truck production more than offset a sharp
rise in auto assemblies.''
   Cynthia Latta, an economist at the DRI@McGraw-Hill forecasting
firm in Lexington, Mass., said industrial production has been cut
in half this year compared to 1988.
   ``This confirms that demand is slowing,'' she said. ``When you
get a slowdown in the economy it tends to show up first in the
goods sector.''
   The manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by the
Fed's tight-money policies as it tries to contain inflation by
slowing the economy without tipping it into a recession.
   William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, called on the Fed to ease further its grip on
credit.
   ``Falling industrial production in September was accompanied by
indications that business investment stopped growing,'' he said.
``With inflation coming down, it is incumbent on the Fed to reduce
interest rates to encourage investment.''
   In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the
nation's factories, mines and utilities also fell in September, by
0.2 percentage point to 83.6 percent. This also reflected the
decline in the production rate.
   Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or
above as an indication of inflationary pressures because the closer
U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to
shortages and price increases.
   Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both
durable and nondurable goods fell 0.2 percent last month after
rising 0.3 percent in July.
   ``The decrease in manufacturing output mainly reflected
widespread weakness in durables,'' which fell 0.5 percent, the Fed
said. Production of nondurable goods edged up 0.1 percent.
   Output at mines and oil wells increased 0.9 percent, while
production at utilities rose 1.2 percent.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in September stood
at 142.3 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.4 percent in
August.
   In its factory use report, the Fed said the operating rate at
manufacturing plants fell from 84.1 percent in August to 83.7
percent in September. It had peaded at 84.7 percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years _ fell 0.6 percentage oint
to 82.1 percent. The rate at factories producting nondurable goods
fell 0.2 percentage point to 86 percent.

   Opponents of U.S. military aid to Central
America demonstrated outside a hotel where Vice President Dan
Quayle was speaking, and 21 people were arrested.
   Several of those arrested were later injured in a traffic
accident as they were being taken to jail. Protester Robin Terry
said the worst injury was a broken leg and that all of the
protesters had been released from a hospital by today.
   ``There were about 200 protesters out there. I would say out of
respect for the office of vice president there should have been
500,'' Quayle quipped during his appearance at a Republican
fund-raiser at a downtown hotel.
   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said it was the
largest demonstration against Quayle since he's been vice president
and the only demonstration that disrupted his schedule. Quayle left
the hotel a half hour late.
   The protest began as a ``die-in,'' with 11 demonstrators wearing
red-stained clothes lying on the sidewalk in front of the hotel.
   When police asked them to move, the protesters tried to push
their way through the doors, chanting: ``Bush, Quayle, we know you;
Hitler was elected, too.''
   Police used nightsticks to quell the demonstration. ``It was
hats and bats and shoving and pushing,'' said a police officer who
didn't give his name.
   Earlier, Quayle dropped in at an FBI news conference to praise
investigators' efforts in breaking up a drug ring.
   ``What you've been able to accomplish is part of the strategy of
President Bush in his war against drugs,'' he told law enforcement
officers from several agencies. ``We're not going to give up until
that war is won.''
   The news conference was called to announce the seizure of $150
million worth of tar heroin and cocaine on the West Coast.

<HEAD>NAACP Officials Ask University of Mississippi to Integrate Fraternities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state NAACP demanded full racial
integration of University of Mississippi fraternities and
sororities in a meeting Tuesday with school officials.
   The meeting was in response to an incident last month in which
two white fraternity pledges were left naked, with racial slurs
scrawled on them, at a black college near the university.
   NAACP officials also recommended stiffer penalties for racial
incidents on campus; additional black staff members at the
university so students of all backgrounds would have more black
role models; and establishment of an academic course that would
give students a knowledge of black history and cultural differences.
   Such a course is scheduled to start next fall.
   ``The meeting was a sharing of ideas by officials representing
the NAACP and Ole Miss officials,'' said Ed Meek, director of
public relations at the university. ``It was a calm, deliberate
kind of discussion.''
   ``The black community is outraged and disturbed at what took
place and the ongoing racial incidents stemming from the
fraternities and students who are enrolled there,'' Morris Kinsey,
education chairman for the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said prior to
the meeting.
   Kinsey was joined by state NAACP President Aaron Henry and other
NAACP officials in the meeting with a university delegation headed
by Chancellor Gerald Turner, Meek said.
   He said Turner told the NAACP officials that ``many of the
recommendations were already under study and said their concerns
certainly would be taken under advisement.''
   The Beta Theta Pi fraternity was expelled from campus for three
years because of the recent racial incident. The chancellor also
handed out punishments ranging from expulsion to probation to 14
students who took part in the prank.
   Last week, Turner set up a 23-member minority affairs council to
build programs and policies to increase minority participation in
campus life.

   Backers of a United Airlines buyout are working
to salvage the deal whose failure to line up financing helped
trigger the stock market's Friday the 13th drop, but the revised
plan could knock $1 billion off the price.
   Stock of the airline's parent company, UAL Corp., was down
$23.87{ to $199 a share by midday today on the New York Stock
Exchange, after plummeting $56.87{ a share on Monday.
   A $300-a-share offer by United's pilots and management collapsed
and the company's stock price began plunging Friday when banks
refused to finance the $6.75 billion deal.
   On Monday, top UAL Corp. executives flew to New York, Washington
and Europe to meet with legal and financial advisers, bankers and
lobbying strategists in an attempt to keep the buyout attempt alive.
   Citibank, the New York-based bank that is leading a syndicate of
lenders involved in the UAL deal, today confirmed reports that it
had presented potential Japanese lenders with terms for a revised
bid.
   ``We have expressions of interest from both the borrower and the
banks,'' said spokeswoman Holly Cherico in New York. ``We do not
have an agreement ... but we are working with both towards coming
to a satisfactory resolution with the financing.''
   Under the proposed terms, the bid would be lowered to $250 a
share, said Akira Yokoo, a Citicorp spokesman in Tokyo. That would
value UAL at about $5.62 billion.
   The terms also called for a higher interest rate on the loan and
bigger fees for participating banks, he said today.
   United pilots issued a statement denying there was any formal
offer at $250.
   ``All Citibank has been doing is sounding out various financial
institutions to determine the acceptability of various changes from
the original offer,'' the statement said.
   U.S. and international banks have given ``expressions of
interest'' in lending enough money to finance a UAL buyout, said
Rodney F. Ballek, head of Citibank's corporate finance division.
   Those expressions, which are not formal commitments, are
``significantly in excess of what is required,'' Ballek told The
New York Times.
   However, the newspaper said it was not clear whether the terms
of the financing would be acceptable to the management-pilot buyout
group.
   When the buyout group, which also includes British Airways PLC,
announced Friday that financing had not gone through, it helped
trigger a 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average,
the steepest one-day point decline since the 1987 crash.
   UAL stock Monday closed at $222.87{, down $56.87{ on the day.
   Stephen Dexter, an airline industry analyst with Kemper
Financial Services Inc., said that shows that the market ``has
very, very high doubt as to whether this deal can be consumated.''

<HEAD>Freed Black Leader Says Violence Needed to Pressure Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freed African National Congress
leader Walter Sisulu said Tuesday his organization must pursue
violence to pressure the government into concessions that might
lead to negotiations.
   Sisulu, released Sunday along with six other senior ANC leaders,
said pressure by anti-apartheid groups locally and abroad compelled
the government to free them unconditionally after lengthy prison
terms.
   The releases ``were merely a reaction to the pressure of the
world,'' Sisulu told foreign journalists at a church near his home
in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.
   Sisulu, 77, is the highest-ranking of the freed activists and
and spent 26 years in prison along with his close friend, senior
ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   President F.W. de Klerk decided to release the prisoners as part
of his effort to improve the climate for negotiating a new
constitution that will include the 28 million black majority.
   The government has said the ANC must renounce violence before it
can be allowed to participate in the talks, but Sisulu said he
believes the ANC should pursue violence to maintain pressure on the
government.
   ``We don't reject violence,'' said Sisulu. ``It's not because
(the ANC) believes in violence for its own sake. It is because of
compelling conditions. remove the compelling conditions and there
will be peace.''
   The ANC's bombing and sabotage campaign, launched in 1961, has
been largely dormant this year. There have been more than 210
bombings responsible for 37 deaths since the state of emergency was
declared in 1986, but only about 40 blasts and three deaths this
year.
   Sisulu denied the ANC had partially suspended its campaign of
violence, suggesting it was a ``logistical'' decision.
   He also called for stronger economic sanctions against South
Africa.
   ``The pressure must be sustained,'' he said. ``There must be no
chance for the government to retreat and reorganize.''
   He said the ANC and its backers would not accept anything short
of a one-person, one-vote system.
   ``Democracy _ I know it to be only one thing: a vote for all.
There is no other democracy,'' said Sisulu. ``We have got
fundamental differences on that'' with the government.
   Asked about changes in South Africa since he went to prison,
Sisulu said: ``I find the spirit of the people different. I think
there is much greater political consciousness, greater awareness,
greater unity.''
   The Cabinet minister assigned to promote negotiations with black
leaders said Tuesday he was prepared to confer with Sisulu about
the ANC's possible role in formal talks.
   ``If we want to get going, the fewer preconditions the better,''
said Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen.
   He said the ANC would have to demonstrate it was committed to a
peaceful negotiation process. But he indicated the outlawed
guerrilla movement would not necessarily have to make a formal
renunciation of violence, as previously demanded by the government.
   Viljoen said the appropriate climate for negotiations ``can only
come about if, in practice, people distance themselves from
violence and destablizing activities.''
   Sisulu said the ANC would be prepared to enter negotiations if
the government legalized all banned political organizations, lifted
the state of emergency, released all political prisoners and
reprieved all prisoners on Death Row.
   De Klerk says he is reviewing these matters to see what steps he
might be able to take, and Viljoen expressed willingness to meet
with Sisulu to discuss the demands.
   All but one of the freed prisoners served at least 25 years in
jail. Five, including Sisulu, were sentenced to life prison terms
in 1964, along with Mandela, for plotting anti-government sabotage.
   Mandela, 71, remains imprisoned, although he is expected to be
released soon.

   Judge Alcee L. Hastings said Tuesday he
believes he will win his fight to remain on the federal bench, but
hinted he might attempt an unusual appeal to the Supreme Court if
the Senate votes to remove him.
   ``I'm not going to be convicted,'' the Miami jurist told a news
conference the day before the Senate was to hear final arguments in
his impeachment case.
   A special committee of 12 senators heard evidence in the
impeachment trial in July and August and the Senate is now nearing
the final chapter in the case.
   The Senate is to hear final arguments Wednesday, followed by a
closed-door debate Thursday with the vote to come at an unspecified
time afterward.
   A Senate vote to convict Hastings on any of the charges against
him would immediately remove him as a federal judge and halt
payment of his $89,500 judicial salary.
   Hastings is accused in the articles of impeachment, approved by
the House in August 1988, of plotting to accept a $150,000 payoff
and lying about it to a U.S. District Court jury in 1983.
   The jury acquitted Hastings, the first black federal judge in
Florida history.
   The articles of impeachment also accuse Hastings of improper
disclosure of information obtained as a result of a federal wiretap
that he had authorized. The allegation arose after the 1983 trial,
and thus was not an issue in it.
   Senate action in an impeachment case is considered final.
   Hastings said, however, that so many unusual issues have arisen
that an attempt might be made to appeal an unfavorable verdict to
the Supreme Court.
   ``There is that possibility,'' Hastings told the news
conference, which was called by congressional Delegate Walter
Fauntroy, D-D.C., as a way to register his support for the
embattled judge.
   As an example of one unusual circumstance in the case, he noted
that he was acquitted by the 1983 jury but being placed on trial
anyway. He said that represented a violation of his right against
double jeopardy.
   The Senate has determined that the impeachment trial does not
represent double jeopardy, calling it a fundamentally different
type of proceeding from a criminal trial. If convicted, Hastings
would merely be removed as a judge. He would not face any sentence,
fine or the like.
   Hastings reiterated that he believes the major reason for the
allegations against him is that he was used as a ``guinea pig'' to
test judicial ethics rules. But he also expressed the belief that
race played a role in the case.
   ``I am not guilty of having committed any crime at all
whatsoever,'' Hastings said. ``But even so, with innocence as my
defense and the facts as my defense, if I were a white person this
would not be happening.''
   Despite Hastings' claim, black leaders have with some exceptions
kept their distance from the case. Among the House prosecutors,
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a veteran campaigner for civil rights,
said at the time Hastings was impeached that the judge had brought
his problems on himself.
   Fauntroy, however, told the news conference that ``basic
constitutional principles of justice and fairness are being
violated in the impeachment proceedings against Judge Alcee
Hastings.''
   ``I find it difficult to believe that, after nearly a decade
when records have been lost and witnesses have passed, any serious
student or advocate of the United States Constitution would
consider the upcoming proceedings of the Senate just or fair,''
Fauntroy said.

   The Bush administration made a fresh appeal
Tuesday to Palestinian Arabs to negotiate with Israel despite PLO
rejection of a five-point proposal by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   ``The Palestinians have to find a way to respond positively and
to move forward, and the PLO to do nothing to block it,'' Margaret
D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said.
   ``We are working to try to get the Israelis and the Palestinians
to a dialogue,'' she said. She declined to say whether the
administration thought Palestinians could agree to negotiate with
Israel without a green light from the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The PLO Central Council, at the end of a two-day meeting Monday
in Baghdad, Iraq, rejected Baker's proposal for implementing an
Israeli election plan on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   ``The PLO and the PLO alone has the right to name the
Palestinian side to any talks with Israel, whether they be
Palestinians inside the occupied territories or outside,'' the
Central Council declaration said.
   The Israeli plan, and proposals by Baker and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to implement it, provide no direct role for the PLO
in talks with Israel.
   Under Baker's framework, however, Egypt is consulting with the
PLO about the Palestinians who would arrange the elections with
Israel. Shamir objects, meanwhile, to Mubarak's effort to include
two Palestinians who had been deported from the West Bank.
   Spokeswoman Tutwiler said Baker ``is still engaged'' with
Israeli and Egyptian officials about the election proposal.
However, she added: ``If, in the end, the parties in the area are
not prepared to pursue peace then progress will not be made. We
cannot produce progress on our own if the parties do not have the
will to move ahead.''
   Under Shamir's proposal, Palestinians chosen in the balloting
would make arrangements with Israel for five years of limited
self-rule to be followed by wider negotiations on an overall Middle
East settlement. Egypt and Jordan, which held Gaza and the West
Bank for 20 years, would participate in the talks.
   The PLO has denounced the proposal as a device to preclude the
establishment of a Palestinian state. U.S. policy opposes statehood
for the Palestinians while calling on Israel to relinquish
territory in return for peace.
   Spokeswoman Tutwiler said Baker was not discouraged by the PLO
Council's action. ``Obviously, the Palestinians have to find a way
to respond positively and to move forward,'' the U.S. official
said. ``They should have an interest in pursuing peace in a
realistic way. ... We do not consider any of these statements to be
anybody's last words.''
   Baker's five-point proposal includes a three-way meeting in
Washington with Israelis and Egyptians before the
Israeli-Palestinian talks. Also, Israel would meet with
Palestinians only if it was ``satisfied'' with the composition of
the delegation.

<HEAD>Gandhi Calls For Parliamentary Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Tuesday
called new parliamentary elections for next month following charges
of corruption against his government and the defeat of two
constitutional amendments.
   The elections are seen as a test of the durability of the
world's only democratically elected dynasty. Gandhi's family has
governed independent India for all but five years of its 42-year
history.
   Voting will be conducted Nov. 22 and Nov. 24 in all but one of
India's 25 states, said Chief Election Commissioner R.V.S. Peri
Sastri. New elections had been due by mid-January.
   Because of the vastness of this country of 880 million people,
elections normally are conducted over several days.
   At stake are 542 seats in the Lok Sabha, or house of the people,
the law-making lower house of Parliament. Gandhi's Congress Party
won 415 seats in the last elections, held in December 1984 two
months after Sikh bodyguards assassinated Gandhi's mother and
predecessor, Indira Gandhi.
   Gandhi's decision to call elections early came on the heels of
new charges of high-level corruption and his failure to push the
two amendments through Parliament last week.
   Viswanath Pratap Singh, once one of the prime minister's
staunchest allies and now one of his bitterest rivals, said Gandhi
had no choice.
   ``By deciding to face the people, the government has been forced
to take the only option available to it,'' said Singh, leader of
the Janata Dal, or People's Party, one of five opposition groups
that comprise the often fractious coalition known as the National
Front.
   ``The National Front and the Janata Dal are fully prepared to
meet the challenge posed to the future of the nation by a corrupt,
inept and treacherous regime headed by a totally venal and amoral
individual,'' said Singh, who once belonged to Gandhi's Congress
Party and served him as defense and finance ministers.
   The decision to call fresh elections came abruptly, with Gandhi
canceling plans to attend this week's Commonwealth summit in
Malaysia and summoning his Cabinet.
   ``The decision is a culmination of political developments after
the constitutional amendment bills failed to get the requisite
two-thirds majority,'' said an official source, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The government also wanted to scotch
rumors that it was considering postponing the election.''
   Sources said Gandhi and the Congress Party wanted to turn the
election into a referendum on the two bills he had campaigned hard
for, only to see them fall three votes short of the necessary
two-thirds majority Friday. The bills were proposed constitutional
amendments that Gandhi said would give more power to village and
municipal governments.
   Singh and other opposition politicians, however, said the bills
were intended to consolidate federal power at the expense of state
governments.
   Gandhi, a 45-year-old former airline pilot, has been dogged for
more than two years by opposition and newspaper charges that people
close to him and his party received up to $50 million in kickbacks
from the Swedish arms manufacturer, AB Bofors, to secure a 1986
contract to sell $1.4 billion worth of artillery guns to India.
   Gandhi has repeatedly denied he profited from the deal and
insisted no Indians received commissions. But newspaper reports
have alleged the money was funneled to a series of companies whose
ownerships are largely a mystery.

   President Bush assured South Korean President
Roh Tae Woo today that the United States will stand by its security
commitments but said South Korea must open its markets more to U.S.
products.
   With Roh standing at his side in the East Room of the White
House after more than two hours of talks, Bush promised that U.S.
forces will remain in South Korea ``as long as there is a threat
from the north.'' He expressed support for Roh's efforts to reduce
tensions on the peninsula.
   But he said that while Korean workers and companies have
benefited from access to open markets in the United States,
``American workers and companies deserve equal access to Korean
markets.''
   Bush added that protectionism offers no more than a ``false
prosperity.''
   The trade issue has been the thorniest between the two
countries, and Roh said much progress has been made in easing
frictions.
   He said, ``In spite of many domestic difficulties, the Korean
government, with strong faith in free and fair trade, has been
moving toward economic liberalization and market opening.''
   On the security question, Roh said he and Bush agreed that there
should be no change in existing arrangements, adding that he felt
reassured by Bush's position.
   The two exchanged views at an Oval Office session also attended
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney.
   Talk of a reduced U.S. military deployment has become more
commonplace as South Korea becomes more prosperous and the Soviet
Union appears to be a less menacing adversary than it was before.
Moscow has close links to Seoul's arch-rival, North Korea.
   Roh said before leaving South Korea that he saw little
possibility of any significant change in the ``general level'' of
U.S. forces in South Korea, which have numbered about 40,000 for
many years.
   But he said South Korea will increase its share of the cost of
stationing U.S. forces in his country.
   Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on Monday,
said maintenance of the U.S. deterrent in South Korea is a high
priority for both countries.
   Still, the official, asking not to be identified, said ``minor
reductions'' are possible in the future as South Korea assumes a
larger role in its own defense.
   After late morning talks in the White House Oval Office, Bush
planned a working luncheon with his guest. Roh also expects to
address a joint meeting of Congress during his stay.
   Bush met with Roh in Seoul a month after taking office.
   The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Michael Armacost, appeared to be
laying the groundwork for an eventual U.S. troop reduction when he
said last week there will come a time ``when it is appropriate to
adjust the size'' of U.S. forces in South Korea.
   The administration has begun a review of the U.S. military
commitment to South Korea and some in Congress believe reductions
should come sooner rather than later.
   But the administration believes that with North Korea continuing
to modernize its military forces, the United States should be in no
hurry to institute cutbacks.
   Administration officials are delighted with the democratic
progress South Korea has made over the past two years.
   But human rights groups claim there has been an increase in
repression lately. And the senior U.S. official said Monday that
although the overall picture is positive, ``the impression should
not be one of complacency'' in Washington.
   Roh has defended the arrest of several hundred dissidents in
recent months, saying they had violated the law.
   Anti-American radicals are a small but powerful lobby in South
Korea. They added to their reputation for bold action last week
when six of them staged a violent attack on the U.S. ambassador's
residence.
   Thousands took part in anti-American protests around the country
on Friday and Saturday.

   The House early this month approved a $22.7 billion child care
package that Miller said addresses the problems of salary and
training. Now lawmakers are working out differences between the
House version and one passed by the Senate earlier this year.
   The study _ funded with $500,000 by a consortium of foundations
including the Ford Foundation and the Foundation for Child
Development _ examined 227 child care centers in Atlanta, Boston,
Detroit, Phoenix and Seattle between February 1988 and August 1988.
   The centers served more than 16,000 families and employed more
than 3,000 staffers.
   ``The staffing study dramatically supports the adage, `You get
what you pay for,''' said Barbara Willer of the National
Association for the Education of Young Children.
   The study was endorsed by both the Service Employees
International Union and the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, which have been working to organize child
care workers.
   SEIU President John Sweeney noted that only 4 percent of child
care teachers ``are protected by a union contract,'' and called for
``adoption of minimum federal standards for adult-child ratios,
staff training, education, and compensation.''
   Investigator Deborah Phillips of the University of Virginia said
the study found ``better quality centers had higher wages for
teaching staff, lower teaching staff turnover, better educated and
trained staff and more teachers caring for fewer children.'' Better
centers also were more likely to be non-profit, she said.
   The study also found that low- and high-income children were
more likely than middle-income children to attend centers providing
higher quality care. She said the main reason is that day care for
low-income families oftentimes is subsidized by the federal
government, while middle-income families must personally pay for
the entire expense.

<HEAD>Pope Says Governments Have Duty to Protect Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II said Tuesday that
governments have the duty to protect human life from conception
until death.
   Noting that the Roman Catholic church ``defends human life from
its initial stages until its natural end,'' the pontiff said civil
authorities must do the same.
   ``Civil society, which is responsible for the common good, has
the duty to guarantee, through law, the right to life for all and
the respect of every human life until its last moment,'' he said.
   The pontiff, who returned Monday night from a 10-day Asian
pilgrimage, spoke to a group of European bishops meeting in Rome to
discuss the way birth and death are treated in modern society.
   John Paul said the issue poses a serious challenge to the
church, especially in the wake of this century's scientific and
technological advances.
   He said modern society ``pushes man to a reduced vision of birth
and death, in which the transcendent dimension of the person
becomes obscured, if not altogether ignored or denied.''
   ``The church has the historic task of helping modern man recover
the sense of living and dying, which in many cases today seems to
escape him,'' the pope said.
   He specifically condemned abortion, which is outlawed by the
church, and warned about advances in genetics and biogenetics which
sometimes lead to ``the logic of the creation of a product and not
the procreation of a person.''
   The pope offered his support to groups coming under the banner
``Movements for Life'' and said the church should work closer with
them.
   In Warsaw, Poland's ambassador to the Vatican said the pope may
make his fourth trip to his homeland as pontiff in 1991.
   ``There have been no official statements by the government or
the episcopate, but there is every indication that in tune with the
four-year cycle, we must prepare for this pilgrimage,'' said
Ambassador Jerzy Kuberski, interviewed in the government daily
Rzeczpospolita.
   John Paul visited Poland in 1979, 1983 and 1987.

<TEXT>
   A Spanish free-lance journalist has
been sentenced to five years in prison for illegally entering
Afghanistan, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
   Jorge Juan Garcia, 35, arrested near the Pakistani border in
August, was tried and sentenced Sunday. The government spokesman
said Garcia was convicted of entering the country illegally and
collecting ``anti-government'' material.
   Garcia entered Afghanistan with U.S.-backed guerrillas known as
the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, who have been fighting
for 11 years. Since the Soviets withdrew their troops in February,
the guerrillas have continued to battle the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul.
   In a news conference in September, Garcia said he was had not
collaborated with the guerrillas and that he was ``just making
notes for my book.''
   A government spokesman said Garcia's five-year sentence was not
excessive and that it matched the conviction. He said the
government would consider relasing Garcia if Spain made a formal
request.
   The Afghan government apparently seeks to use such incidents for
diplomatic purposes. A senior French official went to Kabul last
month to secure the release of Henri-Xavier Lemire, a French aid
worker also arrested for illegally entering Afghanistan.
   In July, the Afghan government released a jailed American
photographer Tony O'Brien after Washington complied with a demand
to make a formal request for his freedom from the regime it does
not recognize. O'Brien was captured at a guerrilla hideout but was
never charged.
   A French photographer and an Italian photographer captured by
government forces were freed last year, but only after their
governments formally requested their release and dispatched senior
officials to Kabul.

   Motorists waxed nostalgic during a tearful
farewell to the Studio City car wash they battled to spare from a
wrecker's ball.
   ``I'll miss this place,'' said Pat Galati, his reddened eyes
gazing over the empty car wash waiting room.
   Galati, who operated the car wash and gasoline station, watched
the last car roll through the scrub brushes on Saturday. ``It's
really hard to say goodbye to people you've known for 35 years,''
he said.
   Residents, fans and motorists battled all summer to keep
property owner Ira Smedra from going ahead with demolition and
construction of a shopping center on the site.
   The car wash had a brief brush with immortality when the
Cultural Heritage Commission considered landmark status for the
odd-looking structure, which features a 55-foot tower in the shape
of three giant boomerangs.
   But the commission turned down the request in July.
   ``I'll miss this place. I've taken my car here every Saturday
for five years,'' said Ed Peck, watching workers towel off his
green 1965 Mustang.
   Smedra is angry, meanwhile, that the city has required an
environmental study that could cost $1 million and stall
construction of his $15 million shopping center.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's education secretary is in East
Harlem to hail that struggling district for allowing parents wide
choice in the schools their kids can attend. He got back a bitter
message: Praise is nice, but send money.
   Several hundred parents, educators and community activists met
with U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos on Monday night in
the auditorium of Intermediate School 117.
   The school's district ranked last in pupil performance in the
city 17 years ago but gained national recognition by replacing
overcrowded, failing schools with 52 smaller magnet schools for
parents to choose from.
   ``You have right here one of the best examples of choice in the
United States,'' Cavazos told the gathering, the first event in a
two-day regional meeting that the Bush administration hopes will
help spread the idea of choice as a reform measure.
   ``Choice is the cornerstone of education reform,'' Cazvazos said
in the keynote speech delivered today.
   He stressed, however, that he did not view choice as a cure-all
for America's education problems. ``When I talk about choice, I see
that as one, one of the strategies.''
   The conference was to conclude later in the day with a speech by
New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and workshops on how choice operates
elsewhere in the country.
   President Bush and others believe that if parents had more
options, the resulting competition would compel schools everywhere
to improve. Bush has called choice ``the single most promising
idea'' in education today.
   But parent after parent during Monday night's 2{-hour forum said
schools generally, and in their district in particular, were
shortchanged by the federal, state and city governments.
   ``I don't want to read his lips. I don't want to see a thousand
lights. What we need is money,'' said Pat Bradford, a Newark, N.J.,
parent.
   Dolores Quintero, whose 10-year-old son attends school in the
East Harlem district and who was homeless for 15 months, said: ``If
I could learn to stretch my dollars when I was homeless, then you
in the government ought to be able to figure it out. In the name of
Jesus, kick up the money.''
   Several parents referred to the Education Department's rejection
in August of the district's application for a $1.4 million federal
magnet school grant, leaving the local board struggling to save 30
teaching and staff positions.
   ``The irony is that we're celebrating choice at a time when
we're in a crisis in this district. Instead of increased support,
we're getting less support,'' said Ray Rivera, who has two children
in the district's schools.
   Cavazos, in brief remarks at the close of the evening session,
said that ``the funding issue will continue to be a major, major
discussion.'' At a news conference today, he said that East
Harlem's grant bid had been denied through a competitive process
that he had nothing to do with.
   ``Unfortunately we ran out of money,'' Cavazos said. He added
that the Bush administration had sought from Congress last spring
$100 million in additional federal magnet school grants. The
measure is still awaiting action.
   Cavazos's two-day visit to the school was the first of five
regional meetings on parental choice planned by the administration.
The other stops are in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Oct. 23-24; Charlotte,
N.C., Nov. 13-14; Denver, Nov. 16-17; and Richmond, Calif., Nov.
28-29.
   Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Arkansas already have adopted
statewide ``open enrollment'' plans giving parents wide discretion
in choosing schools even outside their districts. Scores of local
districts around the country have for years offered magnet and
alternative schools that extend options beyond neighborhood schools.
   Several education groups have been cool to the idea of choice,
warning it's no cure for America's school problems.
   In a statement last month, the American Association of School
Administrators expressed concern that the choice concept might
worsen some schools by encouraging the most motivated parents and
youngsters to flee, while other families simply couldn't afford the
transportation to schools outside their neighborhoods.
   But choice advocates frequently cite Harlem's Community School
District 4, where I.S. 117 is located, as proof that choice can
transform even desperately downtrodden urban districts.
   In 1972, District 4 was dead last among New York City's 32
community districts in reading and math scores. Only 15 percent
read at their grade level. I.S. 117 was a failing, impersonal
school with more than 2,000 students.
   Armed with federal and private dollars and the idea that parents
should be free to choose among schools with themes, nearly everyone
agrees that schools like I.S. 117 were gradually transformed for
the better _ so much so that children outside this impoverished
district are on waiting lists to attend.
   The school houses four academies _ schools within schools _ each
occupying a floor and each with roughly 200 students: a gifted
program, a school for performing arts, a career academy to help
children develop career goals, and a special school with small
classes to help underachieving youngsters with emotional problems.

   Vladimir Karimov, 39, a member of the Soviet Union Red Army

   Karimov had asked for political asylum Monday night at a police

   Nearly all the 1,160 inmates at the Federal
Detention Center boycotted the dining hall for a second day
Tuesday, but officials said they couldn't find out why.
   ``We've had staff circulating through the population since
yesterday lunchtime, and we just haven't been able to pick up much
of anything,'' M.L. Jeziorski, executive assistant to the warden,
said.
   Only about 100 inmates ate at the dining hall Monday or Tuesday,
he said.
   ``In an ordinary hunger strike, the inmates would present a list
of grievances to the administration in hopes of getting changes,''
said Jeziorski. ``But we've gotten no list of complaints, no one
stood forth as spokesman for inmates.''
   At lunch Monday, inmates refused a meal of pork chops, potatoes,
cabbage and salad, Jeziorski said. They also refused to eat the
dinner of meatballs and noodles.
   Jeziorski said the prison closed the commissary after lunch
Monday, so striking inmates could eat only what little they might
have in their cells.
   In 1987, Cuban detainees took hostages, rioted and set fire to
the Federal Detention Center during an eight-day siege. The rebuilt
center does not house Cuban detainees, Jeziorski said.
   He said inmates at the center continued the normal routine of
work, school and recreation.
   ``There's not even a hint of violence or anything of that
nature,'' he said.
   Jeziorski said the prison continued to prepare meals. It was
salvaging what food it could, but had to throw away a lot, he said.
   The food couldn't be given to soup kitchens or other charities,
he said.
   ``It's something we couldn't even consider. We couldn't
guarantee the quality after it left here _ some could be sabotaged
or whatever,'' he said.

   NASA has given elaborate assurances
that the nuclear power plant carried by space shuttle Atlantis is
safe, but dozens of experts were on hand _ just in case _ before
today's launch was scrubbed.
   They were ready ``if the unthinkable happens,'' said Chris West,
a spokesman for the Department of Energy.
   About 50 people carrying dosimeters and other devices were to be
scattered around the Kennedy Space Center to sample the air in case
of an accident as the shuttle lifted off. The launch was scheduled
for 12:57 p.m. but was canceled because of rain, and NASA
considered making another attempt on Wednesday. The Department of
Energy had planned to have an airplane aloft and 150 people
standing by.
   In a Washington courtroom last week, attorneys for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration convinced a judge that the
launch was safe and that the two nuclear power packs on the Galileo
space probe would not leak even after a Challenger-like explosion.
   West said the Department of Energy was asked by the state of
Florida and Brevard County, where the Kennedy Space Center is
located, to monitor the launch. A twin turboprop airplane,
outfitted with sophisticated detection equipment, was to circle the
area at lift-off time.
   ``If the unthinkable happens, as soon as the big pieces stop
falling, the plane will do a criss-cross pattern around the
vicinity of the problem and map from the air what the radiation
levels are and where it's going,'' he said.
   Ten teams of two people each will be at posts outside the launch
center with equipment designed to detect plutonium-238, the fuel
used to provide electricity for the Galileo space probe on its
eight-year mission to Jupiter.
   The two nuclear generators on Galileo, carrying 24.7 pounds of
plutonium each, are not reactors and would not produce fission
products in an explosion, NASA said. If the containers broke open,
the plutonium inside would emit mostly heat and alpha radiation _ a
low-level radiation that is stopped by even a piece of paper.
   In case of an accident, said West, state and local authorities
would go on radio and television and advise people to stay indoor
or in their cars and turn on the air conditioning until the
pollution had blown out of the area.

<HEAD>State Department: U.N. Officials Are Impartial Toward Namibia Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. officials have impartially supervised
preparations for upcoming elections in Namibia, despite initial
fears they might favor leftist guerrillas, a top State Department
official said Tuesday.
   John R. Bolton, the assistant secretary of State for
international organizations, told a group of conservatives that the
U.N. Transition Assistance Group in Namibia has done a good job of
preparing the country for its first elections Nov. 7.
   Voters in the country, a South Africa-governed territory
formerly known as South-West Africa, will go to the polls to elect
delegates for a constituent assembly. That body will draft a
constitution for when Namibia gains full independence next year.
   Bolton said officials in Washington were worried that UNTAG
officials might show favoritism to rebels from the South-West
Africa Peoples Organization, or SWAPO, the group that waged
guerrilla warfare against South Africa for 23 years.
   SWAPO, which operated from bases in Angola and other countries,
has a strong Marxist element. Several years ago, the U.N. General
Assembly accorded SWAPO observer status at the United Nations. It
also created the Council for Namibia, a group that was to
administer the country.
   ``As a result, we and others had significant worries that the
United Nations could not be impartial in supervising an election in
Namibia,'' Bolton said in prepared remarks at a conference on the
future of the territory.
   To date, however, UNTAG ``has not shown any favoritism towards
SWAPO, as was feared, although there have been reports that
individual personnel in UNTAG have done so.''
   The U.N. special representative has told his subordinates that
the ``need to be and be perceived as impartial'' is a key
requirement.
   As an example of even-handedness, Bolton said the U.N. officials
authorized the use of South African and Namibian forces to
counter-attack when SWAPO tried to infiltrate armed guerrillas into
northern Namibia in April, he said.
   In the election, SWAPO representatives will run against those
from right-leaning Democratic Turnhalle Alliance and the Federal
Convention of Namibia.
   So far, nearly 700,000 Namibians have registered to vote and
41,000 Namibians refugees have been repatriated.
   ``If all goes well, conservatives should cautiously welcome the
U.N. role in Namibia,'' Bolton said. ``The emergence of a new state
according to democratic principles is a rare event in the history
of decolonization.''

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Limit Debate on Nicaraguan Package</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 8 grafs new, Senate votes to invoke cloture and begin debate.
Picks up 6th graf pvs, White House spokesman.</HEAD>

   The Senate moved ahead today on a $9 million
aid package President Bush is seeking to give the political
opposition a boost in Nicaraguan elections scheduled for next year.
   The Senate voted 74-25 to limit debate on the issue, assuring
that the matter would come up for a final vote later in the day.
Sixty votes were required to invoke cloture, heading off filibuster
threats from opponents of the package.
   Earlier, at the White House, Bush had mapped strategy with
Republican senators in a bid to win support for the aid package, of
which up to $2 million could go to an electoral council controlled
by the leftist Sandinista government.
   The money would flow through the National Endowment for
Democracy, a quasi-governmental body established by Congress to
encourage democratic processes around the world.
   Some of it would be used to boost the long-shot election chances
of opposition newspaper publisher Violeta Chamorro, the
presidential candidate of the opposition coalition UNO. She is
opposing incumbent President Daniel Ortega, who is seeking
re-election.
   Under Nicaraguan law, half of any contribution to Mrs. Chamarro
must go to the Sandinista-controlled Supreme Electoral Council,
which is supposed to use the money for expenses of running the
election. But U.S. officials fear the it could be spent to aid the
Sandinista side.
   The cloture vote came because of fears that opponents would
filibuster the bill.
   The administration was concerned about an amendment planned by
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, that officials said could torpedo the
entire aid package.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told the
senators that no one likes the prospect of giving $2 million to the
Sandinistas, ``but we have no choice.''
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., charged after the meeting with Bush
that the real intent of the Harkin amendment is ``to assist the
Sandinistas.''
   Harkin, a liberal, was forging an alliance with conservative
senators in an effort to prohibit any U.S. aid from going to the
Sandinistas. The administration said that would in effect kill the
whole aid package and wind up hurting Mrs. Chamarro's chances.
   Harkin was not immediately available for comment, but his
legislative assistant, Ed Long, said, ``The senator wants to have
positive, constructive support for free elections, not support that
would be perceived as having bought off the election. That can be
done with a smaller package.''
   Long said the United States has already provided $3.5 million
through the National Endowment for Democracy for the Nicaraguan
elections.
   The Sandinistas, in control of Nicaragua since 1979, have agreed
to elections Feb. 25. Mrs. Chamarro is facing an uphill struggle
against Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   Fitzwater quoted Bush as saying, ``many senators don't want to
give aid to the Sandinistas, and neither do we, but we have no
choice. It's the only way to help Mrs. Chamarro and the opposition
to assure a reasonable shot at free and fair elections.''
   Congress and the administration have stopped military aid to the
anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.
   Fitzwater said Bush ``feels this election is the last crucial
shot at getting representative democracy in Nicaragua. Under
current circumstances, with the Sandinista government controlling
the media, the assets, the money, the funding, and Mrs. Chamarro
and the opposition being so underfunded there is no way to suggest
that this is a fair election without some (U.S.) support for her
campaign.''

   Windfall or short change? Taxes aren't as
certain as they used to be.
   A $20 million bank error threw off state estimates of how much
sales tax revenue was due earlier this month to New York counties,
cities and towns.
   Quarterly checks to many downstate governments, such as Putnam
County, came up short, while Plattsburgh and others upstate got
more than they deserved.
   But Benjamin Franklin's famous axiom _ the one about death and
taxes being the world's only certainties _ may not be off on the
tax part for long.
   ``We will be informing them very shortly of the adjustments we
have to make upward or downward,'' said Paul Rickard, a state Tax
Department spokesman. ``They shouldn't look at what happened this
month as any significant trend.''
   About $20 million in tax revenue was not counted at a bank,
skewing the complex formula the state uses to distribute the money.
   Plattsburgh, for example, wrongly received a check for $822,000
_ a 17 percent increase over $697,000 last year. Putnam County
received less tax revenue than last year _ $3.9 million, compared
with just more than $4 million.

   Mason Hommel likes his world a little
topsy-turvy.
   The 75-year-old motorist has no plans to exchange license plates
that were printed with the state name, slogan and Connecticut map
upside down.
   Hommel called the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles about
the odd plates he bought recently. The man he talked to told him to
go ahead and use them.
   ``Undoubtedly, he thought I was drunk or something,'' Hommel
said.
   The words ``Connecticut'' and ``Constitution State'' appear
upside down.
   ``I'd love to be stopped by a state cop and see what his
reaction is,'' Hommel said.
   Paul Oates, a state motor vehicles spokesman, said the plates
were made at the Cheshire Correctional Community and are
``basically legal.''
   ``They're an oddity, no doubt about it,'' he said.

   County jail prisoners were freed by a
dispatcher when fire broke out and stayed around to help fight the
blaze.
   There was no fear the five prisoners would escape.
   ``We're just a small country town,'' said San Saba County
sheriff's dispatcher Nan Barker. ``If you're calling from Dallas,
then you really wouldn't understand.''
   The men were transferred to the Mills County Jail, about 20
miles away.
   San Saba County commissioners will have to decide whether their
jail, which was built in 1884, can be repaired.
   The jail was heavily damaged and a computer and radio equipment
lost. No damage estimate was available.
   Investigators had not determined what caused the fire, which
started in an area where recovered property is stored.
   San Saba is a town of about 3,000 located about 80 miles
northwest of Austin.

<HEAD>Railroad Heaven Found in Downtown Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every child's fantasy has come to downtown
Washington, where the National Geographic Society has gathered toy
trains of every size and era into a model railroad heaven.
   Collected from basements and museums, garages and model clubs
across the land, the trains will be on display until Jan. 7 at
Explorer's Hall, on the ground floor of the Society's headquarters.
   Intricate wood and ivory trains carved by Ernest Warther are
displayed across from giant one-eighth size metal model
locomotives; elegant place settings from railroad dining cars are
around the corner from a computerized control system that can run
80 electric model trains at once.
   A class of Maryland third-graders scampered busily around the
displays on opening day, boys and girls equally interested and
amazed.
   But the joy was far from limited to the children, with National
Geographic President Gilbert Grosvenor overheard volunteering to
remain at the exhibit and help out following the grand opening.
   ``The Disappearing Railroad Blues'' was playing over the sound
system as the exhibit opened, but looking around a visitor would
never know that trains are no longer the nation's most important
transportation system.
   Railroad calendars from past years cover one wall, a large
display case traces the comparative sizes of the different popular
model train gauges, a video plays in an enclosed area and visitors
can listen to recordings of train sounds and railroad history.
   ``People of all ages share a nostalgia about railroading,''
observed Susan Coughlin, deputy director of the Federal Railroad
Administration.
   These models, she commented, trace the growth of the United
States from coast to coast,
   Lionel Trains Inc., lent many current and historical items for
the display. Presenting Lionel President Arthur Peisner with a
souvenir boxcar model, Grosvenor paused for a moment and quipped:
``This is a little like someone giving me a map.''
   The railroad display is a map of exacting work and nostalgia.
   ``Any model is never really finished,'' said Robert Love of
Bethlehem, Pa., who lent a section of his model of Leaville, a
project he and his son Dennis have been working on for decades.
   Leaville is a model of a fictional California mining town in the
1930s.
   Only nine feet of the 20-foot Leaville model has come to
Washington, enclosed in a large covered display to simulate night.
All buildings are lighted from inside to show the detail. Street
lights glow and even automobiles have lighted headlights.
   Less technology but the same dedication to detail is shown in
the display of David Warther, who lent several models carved by his
late father, Ernest.
   The elder Warther carved various woods, ivory and mother of
pearl by hand into exacting model trains.
   ``My father felt that every soul on Earth had a God-given
talent, if they could just find it. He found his at age 5,'' said
Warther.
   One model is dismantled to show the exactness. Warther points
out that a single drive wheel is composed of 54 pieces, including
hubs made of a wood containing natural oils so they would never
have to be oiled, since that could stain other parts.
   His father, a steel worker, spent a lifetime carving the model
trains, creating a detailed history of the steam engine that the
family now displays at a museum in Dover, Ohio.
   Playing in their father's workshop was perhaps the ultimate
childhood for train lovers like Warther and his sister. And he
remembers fondly that if, as sometimes happened, there was an
accident and something got broken, dad wasn't cross.
   His father believed that it took more energy to get mad than to
simply repair whatever damage had been done, said David Warther.

<HEAD>House Panel Questions Kemp's Plan to Fight Urban Blight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's plan to fight
urban poverty with economic enterprise zones ran into skeptics
Tuesday in the House Ways and Means Committee, where Democrats
questioned the cost and said big new tax breaks would benefit the
wealthy.
   ``I think we have to be persuaded by more than your
enthusiasm,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., told Kemp as the secretary
made his familiar pitch for enterprise zones. ``I'm not convinced
the ... enthusiasm makes much sense.''
   ``I hope there's more here than just enthusiasm,'' responded
Kemp. ``I didn't come here to be a cheerleader.''
   Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, appeared
before the tax-writing committee to push the administration's plan
for a program of tax incentives aimed at attracting new business
investment to designated areas of economic blight.
   The administration's proposal _ also sponsored with Democratic
Rep. Charles Rangel of New York _ would start with 50 such zones
phased in over four years. In an effort to win the support of
rural-district legislators such as Dorgan, its sponsors have
provided for a portion of the zones to be designated for depressed
rural areas.
   The proposal would eliminate the capital gains tax on tangible
assets within the zones, provide investors with a $50,000 per year
tax deduction for new equity investment and provide an income tax
credit for low-income wage-earners.
   Kemp has frequently boosted the plan in appearances before
Congress, as it is a centerpiece of his plan to use private
enterprise to fight poverty. On Tuesday, he told the panel it
represented not ``trickle-down'' economics but ``a Niagra Falls''
of economic growth.
   Kemp estimated the cost at $1 billion over four years. Rep. J.J.
Pickle, D-Texas, said the total cost when more zones are added
could be much higher, and said Congress has ``apprehension and fear
... that once this starts, the cost will go out of bounds.''
   ``The cost is the thing we've got to face,'' Pickle said.
``Otherwise, the committee is going to have reservations.''
   Kemp said the cost would ``not get out of bounds.''
   Kemp's plan won support from many Republican members, but Rep.
Don Pease, D-Ohio, charged the program would ``generate enormous
tax benefits for the wealthy.''
   ``Why do we have to help poor people by first helping wealthy
people?'' he said.
   Kemp said the tax breaks would benefit investors but that their
money, invested in the zones, would provide jobs and opportunity
for the poor. ``I want to give other people a chance to get rich,''
he said.
   Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., questioned how sponsors could
justify a program that would provide benefits to businesses on one
end of a street but not on the other.
   ``If you can prove to us this is a worthwhile project, I
certainly would join with my colleagues to initiate at least a
pilot program,'' Rostenkowski told Kemp.

<HEAD>NOW Tour Aimed at Coleman's Anti-Abortion Views</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women
launched a tour this week to encourage women to vote for Democrat
L. Douglas Wilder for governor because of the anti-abortion views
of his Republican opponent.
   The involvement by NOW in the campaign between Wilder,
Virginia's lieutenant governor, and former Attorney General J.
Marshall Coleman reflects a turn in the contest during the past
couple of weeks to a focus on abortion.
   ``If we get illegal abortions in this country, women will die,''
said NOW President Molly Yard. ``We will never go back to the day
when abortions were illegal in this country.''
   NOW's ``Freedom Caravan for Women's Lives'' stopped Monday in
Newport News, in Frederickburg on Tuesday, Richmond on Wednesday
and Roanoke on Thursday.
   The NOW caravan comes on the heels of a newspaper and television
advertising campaign by the National Abortion Rights Action League,
which has targeted Coleman for defeat Nov. 7.
   Anti-abortion activists have been less visible in the campaign,
focusing instead on informing supporters about the candidates'
views and conducting occasional protests at abortion clinics.
However, some advertising has been used.
   ``We intend to be involved for Mr. Coleman,'' said David N.
O'Steen of the National Right to Life Committee. ``We just don't
discuss our strategy. ... We want to stay as flexible as possible.''
   Polls show that most Virginians have pro-choice views on
abortion.
   Wilder has endorsed parental consent when a minor seeks an
abortion but otherwise supports leaving unchanged Virginia's law,
which allows virtually unrestricted abortions in the first
trimester.
   Coleman opposes abortion except when the pregnant woman's life
is threatened but has said he would not ask the General Assembly to
adopt abortion restrictions.
   The abortion debate has all but overshadowed other issues in the
campaign, Wilder's bid to become the first elected black governor
of a U.S. state and Coleman's comeback effort from a 1981 defeat in
the race for governor against Democrat Charles S. Robb.

<TEXT>
   The National Science Foundation said
Tuesday it is cutting off funding for Princeton University's
supercomputer center.
   The John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center, home of some
of the most technologically advanced computing devices in the
world, had expected to receive about $69 million over the next five
years.
   Cheryl Dybas, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said support is
being cut off because of the demise of ETA Systems Inc., the
Minnesota computer company that made a machine that is the heart of
the Princeton center.
   Doyle Knight, president of the Consortium for Scientific
Computing, which manages the center, told the The Star-Ledger of
Newark he received a telephone call Monday from the foundation,
informing him that federal funding for the center would be
terminated as of Sept. 30, 1990.
   Center officials have developed a new five-year plan using
equipment from another computer maker, and five members of a
seven-member foundation panel voted to recommend continued funding
after reviewing that plan, he said.
   The center has received about $44 million from the federal
science agency since it was founded five years ago.

   Substitute teachers were hired to
keep classes open during the first teachers strike in this wealthy
city of movie stars, but some classrooms are in chaos.
   One class ordered pizzas Monday, the first day of the strike,
while other students sneaked off to go shopping. Some students in a
second-story classroom at Beverly ills High School hurled books,
papers and even a chair out a window.
   ``It's crazy, it's chaos, it's havoc,'' said junior Chris
Wegener, who left class to join his teachers _ and his mother, a
school counselor _ on the picket line.
   ``I have a feeling the substitute teacher is not going to make

football in his history classroom.
   All but 15 of the city's 300 teachers joined the strike,
affecting 4,700 students in one high school and four elementary
schools.
   Starting Beverly Hills teachers earn $21,604. Starting pay in
Los Angeles, where teachers won a 24 percent raise over three years
after a strike in May, is $27,346. Top scale for a Beverly Hills
teacher is $46,270.
   The district offered an 11 percent increase over two years. The
union wants an 18 percent over two years or 10.5 percent for 1989.
   The yearly after-tax household income in the city of about
33,000 people averages $122,003, according to Quinn-Brein

   President Bush has picked Antonia Novello,

today.
   Novello was undergoing routine background checks before her
formal nomination, said the sources, who spoke only on condition of

that candidate was Novello.
   Novello's office said she had no comment and declined to provide
any background.
   According to an industry newsletter, Medicine &amp; Health, she is
44 years old and studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of
Medicine.
   She would succeed C. Everett Koop, the outspoken pediatrician
who stepped down last month after serving in the post for most of
the decade.
   Novello was recommended to the White House by Louis Sullivan,
secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the
sources said. Her nomination was pushed by Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, the senator's office said.

   Rain today forced NASA to postpone
until Wednesday the launch of space shuttle Atlantis and its
Jupiter-bound Galileo probe.
   ``It appears the local weather will not cooperate, so we're
going to have to scrub,'' launch director Bob Sieck said after the
26-minute period during which Earth and Jupiter were in proper
alignment elapsed without a break in the weather.
   Liftoff of the shuttle and its crew of five was reset for 12:50
p.m. Wednesday.
   With about 200 armed security guards on alert for anti-nuclear
trespassers protesting against launch of the plutonium-powered
Galileo, the countdown had advanced smoothly to a point nine
minutes before the designated 12:57 p.m. liftoff time.
   Showers moved into an area 20 miles offshore that Atlantis would
have to pass through if the astronauts had to make an emergency
landing on a 15,000-foot runway near the launch pad.
   NASA twice suspended the countdown, hoping the rain would pass,
but time ran out.
   Rain hitting a descending shuttle could severely damage the
fragile fiberglass tiles that protect the vehicle from heat during
re-entry from orbit.
   If the Galileo isn't launched by Nov. 21, NASA will have to wait
until 1991 before the planets are again in the right position.
   The $1.5 billion Galileo is the most expensive and sophisticated
unmanned spacecraft ever built and is expected to give the best
look yet at the mysteries of another planet.
   ``It is the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft,'' said Clayne Yeates, a
mission manager.
   The five astronauts boarded the spacecraft at mid-morning. The
mission commander is Donald Williams. The others aboard were Mike
McCulley, the pilot, and mission specialists Ellen Baker, Franklin
Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
   Guards on foot, in helicopters and boats patrolled the Kennedy
Space Center for activists who have said they might try to stop the
launch by infiltrating the launch danger zone. The zone covers five
miles on either side of a line that extends 30 miles to sea.
   Eight demonstrators were arrested for trespassing Monday when
they walked through a line of security guards at a space center
gate. Another was arrested today when he walked up to a gate and
stepped across the space center boundary line.
   The activists oppose the launch because Galileo receives
electrical power from two generators fueled by nearly 50 pounds of
plutonium. They contend an accident a Challenger-like explosion
could scatter radioactive material over Florida.
   Officials of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, which
is leading the protests, had said they would remain today in
Orlando, 50 miles away, so they would not have to breathe
radioactive plutonium if there were an accident.
   NASA said the chances of a plutonium release are less than 1 in
25,000 and even if there were a release there would be no
appreciable health effects.
   Last week, three groups lost a federal court lawsuit to stop the
launch. On Monday, a three-judge appeals court panel upheld the
ruling.
   About 6{ hours after liftoff, the astronauts were to release
Galileo from Atlantis' cargo bay. An hour later, an attached motor
was to boost the 6,700-pound craft on a roundabout, six-year trip
that will cover 2.4 billion miles along the path to Jupiter, the
largest planet in the solar system.
   Along the way, Galileo will obtain fly-by data about the moon,
Venus and two asteroids, Gaspra and Ida. It will make two return
swings by Earth, to within 600 miles next year and within 200 miles
in 1992. The sweeps past Earth and Venus will use the planets'
gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed to reach
its distant target.
   In December 1995, a 737-pound probe released from Galileo is to
plunge into Jupiter's cloud layers and make the first sampling of
its atmosphere.
   Galileo will orbit the planet, and its cameras and 10 scientific
instruments will gather information for about 22 months on
temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, clouds and gravity fields.
   The 1979 Voyager views of Jupiter and its satellites were
breathtaking, but Galileo's images will be up to 1,000 times
clearer, planners say.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wandered like a kid
in a candy store through displays of IBM computers, Band-Aids and
Ritz crackers Tuesday at the first full-fledged U.S. trade show to
be held in the Soviet Union.
   Deprived Soviet consumers soon will enjoy a small flood of such
goodies, according to the head of the council that organized the
fair.
   Dwayne Andreas, co-chairman of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and
Economic Council, said he received a letter from President Bush
promising to press for reduced trade barriers with the Soviet Union.
   Bush wrote that he was ``prepared to work with Congress to open
the way to extending most-favored-nation status'' to the Soviet
Union, Andreas said.
   If the Soviet Union is granted most-favored-nation status,
American tariffs on imported Soviet goods will be lowered.
   ``That means we'll be customers and not only suppliers,''
Andreas said before the fair opened.
   A consortium of six American companies is planning to export
$500 million in consumer goods to the Soviet Union in the coming
months and invest up to $10 billion in joint Soviet-American
ventures in the next 15 years, Andreas said.
   Almost 150 American firms were represented at the trade show.
   Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov meandered for almost
two hours along the aisles of stands, leaving excited vendors in
their wake and collecting an array of souvenirs.
   Gorbachev ``took a veggie burger,'' said Joan Godby, who was at
the stand promoting the Archer Daniels Midland-produced powder that
turns into vegetarian simulations of burgers. ``I don't know if he
actually ate it, but there was a piece out of it.''
   Gorbachev, closely surrounded by jostling bodyguards and
reporters, lingered longest at the IBM stand, where he asked
questions about technology and came away with a prize: a microchip
from the most advanced type of computer IBM sells in the Soviet
Union, embedded in clear plastic and hooked to a keychain.
   Gorbachev and Ryzhkov were also presented with small stuffed
dogs by a manufacturer of toys and children's clothes.
   Gorbachev encouraged one vendor with the prediction that ``if
you get a foothold in the Soviet market, the opportunities are
endless.''
   But he made it clear, with his repeated queries about companies'
intentions in the Soviet Union, that he was most pleased by firms
that wanted not only to buy and sell but also to set up joint
manufacturing enterprises.
   U.S. trade with the Soviet Union traditionally has been minimal,
hampered by the longtime political tension between the two
countries and by geographical distance.
   Soviet-American agriculture trade, mainly American sales of
grain, amounts to more than $2 billion, Andreas said. ``But when I
added up the trade other than agriculture quite recently, I came
face to face with the fact that it's less than we do with Haiti or
Trinidad,'' he said.
   Soviet-American trade is already expanding, with the volume
rising from $1.8 billion in 1987 to $3.3 billion in 1988, said
Soviet Chamber of Commerce chairman Vladislav Malkevich.
   About 100 American companies have founded joint enterprises with
Soviet firms, Malkevich added.
   He said about 20,000 representatives of Soviet businesses were
expected to visit the fair during its eight-day run and try to make
a deal with American partners.
   Fair organizers acknowledged that perhaps the greatest obstacle
to Soviet-American trade remained the non-convertibility of the
ruble. The ruble is not freely exchanged on world currency markets
and its rate is dictated by the Soviet government.
   Asked what guarantee of profitability American firms can have as
long as the ruble remains non-convertible, Gorbachev said, ``I
think that in time, everything will fall into place. Everything is
being done toward that end.''
   Andreas refuted Soviet complaints that the United States does
not seem interested enough in helping Gorbachev's reforms work by
investing in joint enterprises. ``We have over 1,000 people here.
If that isn't an expression of interest, then I don't know what
is,'' he said.
   The scores of stands at the fair made the giant exhibition
center in central Moscow slightly reminiscent of a U.S.-style
shopping mall, with displays of such Americana as Q-Tips, Levi's
jeans, Coca-Cola and a gleaming, midnight blue Cadillac.
   Among the more esoteric offerings were soy protein for Soviet
sausages, dental floss and chicken-growing systems.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Postpones PLO Request For Membership</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UNESCO's General Conference on Tuesday postponed
the PLO's request for membership for two years, a move aimed in
part at persuading the United States to rejoin the U.N. agency.
   In return for agreeing to the postponement, the Palestine
Liberation Organization obtained assurances that UNESCO would
involve Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories more
closely in its activities.
   The decision by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization's highest decision-making body was taken by
consensus. The executive board called Oct. 11 for the postponement.
   Yacov Aviad, the Israeli representative to UNESCO, protested the
PLO membership request ``in the most vigorous terms'' and said it
would divert the organization from more pressing business.
   The head of the PLO observer mission, Omar Massalha, said his
group accepted the postponement ``in order to avoid a confrontation
or disruption that is not in UNESCO's interests.''
   The United States, which left UNESCO in 1985, had said admitting
Palestine as a member state would eliminate any chance of a U.S.
return.
   Massalha said if the PLO had lobbied to have the membership
application approved, it would have succeeded. Most UNESCO members
recognize the Palestinian state proclaimed by the PLO in November
1988.
   UNESCO has promised the Palestinians greater participation in
its educational and cultural programs in the West Bank and Gaza.
   At his opening speech to the month-long conference, Director
General Federico Mayor said he would never allow the organization
to be used for political purposes and vowed to work for ``freedom
of expression that does not have any limits.''
   The Spanish biochemist who took over the troubled agency two
years ago also said he wanted to see disparities between
industrialized and developing nations that threaten cultural
diversity ``grow smaller and eventually disappear.''
   In other business, the conference elected Malaysian Education
Minister Anwar Ibrahim as its chairman for the next two years and
admitted the Cook Islands and Kirbati in the Pacific as the 160th
and 161st members.
   The conference, which meets every two years, will adopt a plan
of activities for the first half of the 1990s and a program and
budget for the next two years.
   The United States and Britain left UNESCO in the mid-1980s
because they said the organization had become too politicized,
spent too much money and was poorly managed under Mayor's
predecessor, Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal.
   Singapore also withdrew, saying it could spend its dues better
elsewhere.
   Mayor hopes to end the decade-long controversy over the New
World Information and Communication Order, which communications
specialists say has been made obsolete by technological advances.
   Western governments and media organizations believe the new
order could lead to press censorship and licensing of journalists.
Developing countries said it was needed because Western media
reported about them unfairly and dominated information flows.
   In his speech, Mayor also appealed for the release of all
hostages, ``journalists or not, who have become pawns in an
intolerable bargaining.''
   This seemed a reference to American and British hostages held in
Lebanon, including Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, and British TV journalist
John McCarthy.

   An international group approved a
formal ban on ivory trade Tuesday after a long, bitter fight over
how best to save the last elephant herds still roaming wild in
Africa.
   The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species overrode
objections from southern African governments, which threatened to
find alternative channels for selling ivory tusks.
   ``This will be a great help,'' said Ian Douglas-Hamilton, a
Nairobi-based expert whose count of 609,000 is the widely accepted
estimate for African elephants, less than half the 1979 total.
   ``The African elephant is enormously better off today than it
was a year ago because of international action,'' he said.
``Unilateral import moratoriums in the United States and Europe are
already showing results.''
   But Wlliam Nduku, head of Zimbabwe's Parks and Wildlife
Department, called the vote a slap at the few countries which
successfully protect their elephants and count on revenue from
legal ivory sales.
   He said Zimbabwe might withdraw altogether from the convention,
known as CITES. Delegates from South Africa, Botswana, Burundi,
Mozambique and Malawi said their governments might file
reservations to the ban, allowing them to find buyers outside of
the convention.
   The compromise won preliminary approval Monday on a 76-11 vote
with four abstentions. The measure sets up a panel of experts to
consider whether countries with well-managed herds might continue
to trade legally in ivory.
   The measure places elephants on the convention's ``Appendix I,''
banning trade in elephant products. Members have 90 days to file
reservations, which means they consider their elephants to be
listed in ``Appendix II,'' which allows trade.
   Some objecting countries said they would organize a ``Southern
African Center for Ivory Marketing'' in Botswana to sell ivory
taken from culled elephants.
   South Africa also might market its ivory through the center,
overcoming political differences with its frontline neighbors.
   ``For us, Appendix I is a dead end. Once our elephants are
listed on it we will never get them off,'' said Pieter Mulder,
chief of the South African delegation. He said South Africa will
accept a two-year moratorium on ivory sales until the next meeting
of the convention but objected to a ban.
   Countries insisting on a ban, including Kenya, Tanzania and the
United States, argue that any legal trade would open loopholes and
encourage poaching in critical areas.
   Japan, which has consumed 40 percent of world ivory exports,
made no immediate comment. Although Japan temporarily banned
imports last month, it could file a reservation and buy southern
African ivory.
   ``This vote was a crushing blow to the ivory market which is the
critical factor in the fate of the elephants,'' said Craig van Note
of the Washington-based Monitor Consortium, a network of
environmentalist groups. ``Now all nations and citizens must reject
any product made from ivory.''
   The long dispute left Africans split and in some cases bitter.
   ``Imagine a situation where Trinidad and Tobago are deciding the
fate of African elephants,'' said Rowan Martin, director of
research in Zimbabwe's wildlife department.
   In South Africa, John Ledger of the private Endangered Wildlife
Trust urged South Africa to renounce all ivory sales.
   ``The ivory trade is rotten to the core,'' he said a statement
from Johannesburg.
   ``By continuing to trade in ivory, South Africa finds itself in
the company of ruthless poachers, smugglers and criminals who will
kill the last elephant in Africa to satisfy their greed.''
   Ivory is highly valued for its use in the signature stamps
popular in many Asian nations and for jewelry, piano keys and
carvings.

<HEAD>Third PLO Guerrilla Killed in 8 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A PLO guerrilla was shot and killed in a
southern Palestinian refugee camp before dawn Tuesday, the third
such killing in eight days, prompting residents to go on strike.
   Armed guerrillas loyal to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat swooped
through the narrow alleys of Ein el-Hilweh after the shooting by
unidentified assailants.
   Munir Saadi, a corporal with the PLO's military police in the
densely populated shantytown, was shot in the head shortly before
sunrise, said a police spokesman who cannot be identified in line
with regulations.
   Witnesses said pro-Arafat guerrillas fired their automatic
rifles in the air in a traditional expression of anger and they
shouted slogans blaming the killing on ``agents of Israel.''
   Brig. Wajih Abu Ali, commander of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military police in the camp on the eastern edge of
Sidon, a southern port city, blamed the killing on ``a terrorist
and criminal faction'' which he did not identify.
   Saadi's assassination came one week after unidentified
assailants gunned down Palestinian physician Ali Hashem in Ein
El-Hilweh.
   Hashem, a member of Arafat's Fatah guerrilla group, was very
popular among the camp's 50,000 refugees. He was killed one day
after gunmen shot and killed a follower of Palestinian terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal in the camp.
   Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council group identified its
dead official only by his code name Sadeq and said in a statement
he was also killed by ``agents of Israel.''
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
Arafat's Fatah in 1973 and founded his own faction, basing it in
the Syrian capital of Damascus. His group, bankrolled by Libya, has
been blamed for a series of terrorist activities, including the
December 1985 attacks on Vienna and Rome airports.
   PLO spokesmen and Lebanese police have also blamed Abu Nidal's
group for the abduction in Sidon Oct. 6 of Emmanuel Christen and
Elio Erriquez, two Swiss citizens working for the Swiss-based
International Committee of the Red Cross.
   The Red Cross representative in Sidon, Roland Sidler, discussed
the abduction with pro-Iranian clergyman Sheik Maher Hammoud in
Sidon.
   ``We denounce the abduction which targeted two people working
for a humanitarian organization that helps the Lebanese people,''
Hammoud said after the meeting.
   Hammoud is one of a few Sunni Moslem clergymen cooperating with
the Shiite Moslem, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
is believed to be the umbrella for the underground pro-Iranian
factions holding 18 Westerners hostage.
   Sidler's organization said its orthopedic center in the southern
provincial capital has failed to provide 81 amputees with
artificial limbs because of the abduction of Christen and Erriquez.
The Red Cross suspended work at the orthopedic center after the two
were abducted.
   There has been no authenticated claim of responsibility for
their kidnapping.

   An outbreak of rabies spread by bats has
killed 23 people in the southeastern jungle, and health officials
are worried more will die if they don't receive an anti-rabies
vaccine.
   Regional Health director Nazario Flores was quoted in the Lima
newspaper Expreso as saying he has asked the government to send 300
doses of vaccine to treat people who have been bitten by bats near
the jungle city of Puerto Maldonado, 690 miles southeast of Lima.
   He said most of the 23 who died are from the mining camp of
Choque, 100 miles east of Puerto Maldonado, and many people have
fled the camp out of fear.
   Flores said at least 100 people are being treated for bat bites
in Choque.

   ABC put an end to NBC's long domination of
the ratings with its broadcasts of the first two games of the San
Francisco Bay-area World Series.
   NBC fell behind ABC in the Nielsen ratings for the week ended
Oct. 15 after an unprecedented winning streak of 68 weeks. In all,
NBC has been the No. 1 network for four years.
   Neither Saturday's game nor Sunday's game between the San
Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics was in the Top 10. In
fact, neither won its time period. But they had enough viewers to
to put ABC into first place.
   ABC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of 14.8. NBC
was second with 13.9 and CBS third with 12.5, according to CBS.
ABC's interpretation of the ratings gave NBC 13.8 and NBC gave
itself 14.0. A ratings point represents the percentage of the 92.1
million television homes. A share is the percentage of the sets in
use.
   The raw data is provided by Nielsen and then interpreted by the
networks. The networks generally agree on their interpretations,
but figures can vary when programs such as ball games run live in
prime time in one part of the country and in fringe time in another
part of the country.
   ``I'm sorry it's come to an end,'' Brandon Tartikoff, president
if NBC Entertainment, said in an earlier interview, ``but I hope we
start a new streak soon.''
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the top-rated show of the week and the
network had three other series in the Top 10. NBC had five shows at
the top and CBS had one.
   Saturday's opening game of the World Series was tied for 18th
place with ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' The Sunday game was 16th.
   It appeared likely that ABC also would win the current week with
additional Series games.
   Here are the Top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne;'' NBC's ``The Cosby
Show;'' NBC's ``Cheers;'' NBC's ``A Different World;'' ABC's ``The
Wonder Years;'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?;'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls;'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote;'' ABC's ``Chicken Soup,'' and
NBC's ``Dear John.''
   ``Chicken Soup'' is the highest-rated new show, and ABC's
``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' tied at 18th place with Saturday's World
Series game, was second. ``Doogie Howser'' is the first series from
producer-creator Steven Bochco's multi-series deal with ABC.
   NBC's ``Mancuso, FBI,'' the last new series to premiere, was in
56th place.
   Here's how other new shows are doing: CBS' ``Major Dad,'' 32nd;
ABC's ``Family Matters,'' 36th; CBS' ``Rescue: 911,'' 45th; CBS'
``Island Son,'' 47th; CBS' ``People Next Door,'' 52nd; ABC's
``Young Riders,'' 55th; NBC's ``Nutt House,'' 58th; ABC's ``Life
Goes On,'' 59th; NBC's ``Hardball,'' 60th; NBC's ``Baywatch,''
NBC's ``Sister Kate,'' and CBS' ``Wolf'' in a tie with NBC's
``Quantum Leap'' for 61st; CBS' ``Top of the Hill,'' 65th; ABC's
``PrimeTime Live,'' 66th; CBS' ``Peaceable Kingdom,'' 72nd; and
CBS' ``Snoops,'' 73rd.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With Children'' remained
its highest-rated show, in 51st place.
   ABC had the highest-rated evening news show. The ratings: ABC
9.9, CBS 9.3, NBC 9.0.
   CBS' ``Saturday Night with Connie Chung'' was the lowest-rated
show among the three networks.
   Here are the bottom five programs among the three networks:
NBC's ``Magical World of Disney,'' CBS' ``Peaceable Kingdom,'' CBS'
``Snoops,'' ``CBS' ``Tour of Duty'' and CBS' ``Saturday Night with
Connie Chung.''

<HEAD>Hungary Parliament Considers End of One-Party Rule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parliament Tuesday began debating bills
designed to end 41 years of communist one-party rule, and
opposition leaders presented petitions urging a delay of next
month's presidential election.
   Lawmakers considered constitutional amendments to eliminate all
references to the leading role of the Communist Party and to bring
the constitution in line with new legislation setting legal
preconditions for multi-party elections due by June 1990.
   Earlier this month, the Communist Party renamed itself the
Socialist Party and committed itself to loosening its hold on power
and allowing multiparty democracy.
   The draft amendments before parliament would end the pattern of
one-party rule, Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said.
   ``Parties will not be able to wield direct power,'' he said,
adding that they would ``declare rights not doled out by the state
but that are guaranteed for each ... citizen.''
   Other bills before parliament include one on the functioning of
political parties, the establishment of a constitutional court and
a new electoral law.
   The body also plans to debate the creation of the office of
state president _ a new post that would replace the collective
presidential council of 21 members. It also will discuss the rights
of the new president and set the date for a free election to the
post. The date has tentatively been set for Nov. 26.
   However, before parliament opened its session, members of the
opposition League of Free Democrats presented more than 120,000
signatures on a petition calling for a referendum on the date and
for a postponement until after next year's national elections.
   Opposition leaders believe that a presidential vote held before
the parliamentary elections would favor the communist candidate,
Minister of State and popular reformer Imre Pozsgay.
   Under recently adopted legislation, parliament must decide on
calling a referendum within 60 days of receiving 100,000 signatures
on a given issue.
   Kulcsar instead suggested that parliament vote on the issue
despite the receipt of the petition, which opposition leaders say
now bears nearly 200,000 signatures.
   He questioned the validity of the way signatures were collected,
noting that the date of the presidential election was only one of
four questions requiring a collective yes or no answer.
   Maverick lawmaker Zoltan Kiraly also criticized the petition,
saying the inclusion of other questions about the party's assets
and its armed guard, the Workers' Militia, misled some signers.
   Members of the opposition League of Free Democrats, which
co-sponsored the petition with the League of Young Democrats, said
it had been conducted properly and charged that Kulcsar and Kiraly
were campaigning for the presidential post by making remarks
broadcast on live television.
   At the weekend the Patriotic People's Front, a mass social
organization trying to shed its affiliation with the ruling party,
nominated Kulcsar for president.
   Kiraly has been proposed by a local group of the small Social
Democratic party, but has denied being a presidential candidate.
   Peter Toelgyessy of the Free Democrats said if the presidential
elections went ahead without a referendum, Hungary would ``not be a
state of law but a police state.''

   President Bush's personal physician says he'd

he disagrees with the president on abortion.
   ``I would love the job,'' Dr. Burton J. Lee III said in an
interview Tuesday. ``But I couldn't take it if that had to be my
position, I wouldn't be able to work effectively and I couldn't do
what the president wants that guy to do. So I would have to say
`no.'''
   ``I think it's wrong,'' Lee said of such an abortion litmus
test. ``But what the hell, a lot of people think it's wrong.''
   Shortly after he made his comments, administration sources said
Bush had chosen Antonia Novello, deputy director of the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development, to be surgeon
general.
   Novello was undergoing routine background checks before her
formal nomination, said the sources, who spoke only on condition of
not being identified. She was one of several women supported by Lee
for the job, and he said she ``would be terrific if she's picked.''
   Lee was the first administration official to state publicly that
candidates to succeed C. Everett Koop as surgeon general must
conform with the president's views on abortion.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said, ``There is no litmus
test on this or any other issue.'' But she added that ``it is
appropriate for people in sensitive positions to articulate the
president's policies.''
   Administration officials also have asked at least one candidate
for the post of director of the National Institutes of Health for
his views on abortion, according to the journal Science.
   Chase Untermeyer, White House personnel chief, said Tuesday that
potential nominees are asked their views on abortion ``if it's
pertinent, and in almost every case there (at the Department of
Health and Human Services) it is.''
   ``The president's position on abortion, and that of the
Republican Party, is well known, and the American people knew that
when he was a candidate,'' Untermeyer said. ``Therefore, it is
entirely appropriate for people being considered for appointments
at HHS to be asked if they hold the same views as those of the
president of the United States, who would appoint them.''
   Bush opposes abortion in most cases except instances of rape and
incest or if the life of the mother is in jeopardy. Lee says he
favors the right of a the mother to decide whether to have an
abortion.
   On the day Lee commented, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater announced Bush would veto legislation, now on the verge
of passage by Congress, that would loosen restrictions on the use
of federal funds for abortion. The bill would allow use of federal
money for abortions in cases of rape and incest.
   Abortion also has emerged as a political issue in campaigns for
governor in Virginia and New Jersey as well as in the race for
mayor of New York City.
   Koop left office the beginning of this month after more than
seven years as the government's top health official. When he was
named surgeon general by President Reagan, Koop was regarded as a
strong foe of abortion and the resulting uproar helped delay Senate
approval of the nomination for nine months.
   By the time Koop left office he was a hero to many of those who
most strongly opposed his nomination. As surgeon general Koop
angered conservatives when he advocated use of condoms and sex
education to combat AIDS and when he refused to issue a report
requested by Reagan on whether women suffered psychological harm
from abortion.
   ``I never made any promises to espouse any causes,'' Koop said
in an interview last spring.
   Lee said he discussed the surgeon general post with Bush and
``I've disqualified myself from any consideration for a job like
that because of my pro-choice stand and he's aware of that.''
   He said he has proposed some 20 candidates for the surgeon
general's job, all of them women and all in agreement with Bush on
abortion.
   ``All of the women whose names I have submitted have said they
can make that statement,'' said Lee.
   A former lymphatic cancer specialist at the Sloane Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, Lee, 59, maintains residences in
Greenwich, Conn., and Washington. He travels with the president and
directs a team of three doctors and nine other medical personnel.
   Bush and Lee discussed the retirement of Koop early in the year
when Koop first told the president of his plans to leave office.
   ``We talked about it very early on,'' Lee said. ``I told him I
was really not a candidate because I couldn't fit in with the
position he wanted to take on (abortion). ... He said, `That's
probably the case.'''
   Lee said he saw no inconsistency with the president's having a
personal physician with pro-choice views while requiring that the
surgeon general be anti-abortion. And he said there has been no
friction between him and the president on the issue.
   ``I'm not dealing with legislation or public policy issues,''
Lee said. ``I give credit to President Bush for seeing that what he
wants is the best physician and not first and foremost an ideologue
on abortion.''

   Millions of drivers, young and old,
have dreamed of owning a Corvette in the years since the car was
introduced in 1953.
   That dream came true for Dennis Amodeo _ 36 times over.
   The 33-year-old carpenter from Huntington Station, N.Y., learned
Saturday that he won VH-1's grand prize: one Corvette for each year
the car has been manufactured.
   ``I've always told myself: `Before I die, I'll have one,'''
Amodeo said Monday night at a reception at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
offices in Culver City.
   Amodeo plans to hold on to the Corvette collection, worth an
estimated $1 million, although insurance costs could exceed the
cars' value.
   ``I'd like to try to keep them,'' he said. ``For now, I'll try
to find a way to get them back'' to his home.
   About 2.2 million people entered the contest sponsored by VH-1,
the soft-rock music video cable channel operated by MTV Networks,
said Jim Cahill, a VH-1 executive.
   The success of the contest was due to the enduring popularity of
the Corvette, Cahill said. ``I can't think of another product which
has inspired as many people in the postwar era than the Corvette.''

<HEAD>No Dancing In The Streets _ Yet _ For Baysball Fans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everyone is supposed to love a parade. But
baseball fans in Oakland and San Francisco have to ponder whether
they can love a victory parade on the other side of the eight-mile
Bay Bridge.
   Fans of the Oakland Athletics weren't dancing in the streets
Tuesday just because their American League champion team was ahead
2-0 in the World Series going into the night game here. Not after
last year, when the A's post-season swagger was humbled by the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
   ``We expected to win last year, and so there is a little more
cautious approach this year,'' said Sonny M. Ismail, who works for
the Port of Oakland. ``Just from observation, everything's very
quiet on the streets.''
   A taste of defeat also hampered the enthusiasm of San Francisco
fans, who had been ecstatic over the Giants' first appearance in a
World Series since 1962.
   ``My heart is with the Giants,'' said Robin O'Donnell, who works
in San Francisco's financial district and acknowledged Tuesday that
the odds didn't look good for a comeback.
   ``I don't like it, but I'm not a worrier,'' said O'Donnell, who
plans to attend all the series games at Candlestick Park this week.
``We've come back from worse situations than this.''
   Both cities have made their parade plans. But until the victory
fireworks, the most colorful signs of team pride are the green A's
flags that adorn streetlights and insignias of the team that can be
seen in the windows of most restaurants in Oakland.
   ``Oakland's been real reserved this year,'' said Tim Gallen, of
Celebrate Oakland, a group leading a promote-Oakland campaign.
``Basically, what's happening is everyone's just waiting to erupt.''
   Some fans have divided loyalties, so a hot souvenir item has
been a baseball cap that has the Giants logo on one side and the
A's insignia on the other.
   CalTrans, the state transportation agency, tried a similar
approach on a grander scale. It put up small Giants banners along
the Bay Bridge route into San Francisco and A's flags along the
bridge heading eastbound, into Oakland.
   Civic boosters say the game they are calling Baysball is a
no-lose situation for the area.
   ``I think they're representing the whole Bay area,'' said Lyle
Gordan, a worker at Cost Plus Nursery in Oakland, where he said
nearly all his customers are talking about the two ballclubs.
   Of course, there are always people who don't care about
baseball, even amid a World Series.
   While diehard fans were attending Game 2, or watching on the
252-square-foot television screen at Jack London Square in Oakland,
Marjorie Fishkin was huddled in a wool coat and scarf in a line to
see the new Woody Allen movie, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.''
   ``Woody Allen is a genius, and I'm not interested in baseball,''
she said.
   Darryl Lindsey of Oakland acknowledged he's not much of a
baseball fan either, and being originally from Los Angeles, he
hasn't followed the A's much.
   But if they do win the World Series, Lindsey said he intends to
be at the victory parade, ``just to be able to say I was there.''

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sudanese court is asking the families
of seven victims of a terrorist gang's bomb to decide whether the
five Palestinians convicted in the attack should live or die.
   Among the victims were a British couple and their two children,
whose relatives are Quakers opposed to the death penalty.
   But contrary to a statement last month by an appeals court, they
and the parents of a fifth British victim, a teacher for a relief
agency, say they have not agreed to pardon the bombers.
   The five Britons and two Sudanese died in May 1988 when a bomb
blew the roof off a Khartoum hotel dining room where the British
victims and one of the Sudanese were having dinner. The other
Sudanese victim was a waiter.
   Dinah Rolfe, whose son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren
died in the blast, said in Britain that she and her husband,
Edward, do not want the killers executed. But she added: ``We don't
think it's sensible to let them go free so that they can kill
again.''
   Ken Rockett, a retired music teacher whose daughter was killed,
said killing the terrorists would make them ``martyrs in their own
country.''
   Rockett said he had ``no desire to see them killed'' but added:
``It is a terrible crime and should be punished.''
   The Palestinians were caught after the bombing and a
simultaneous machine gun attack on a nearby private club restricted
to citizens of Commonwealth nations.
   They told investigators they were avenging the April 1988
assassination by Israeli commandos of Khalil Wazir, also known as
Abu Jihad, who was military commander of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   A year ago, the Palestinians were convicted of bombing and
illegal possession of arms, and were sentenced to hang.
   The official Sudan News Agency this week quoted a judiciary
source as saying the Court of Appeal has asked the government to
notify families of the victims to appear Jan. 3 and say whether
they want the sentence carried out.
   At issue is a stipulation of Sudan's Islamic law, or Sharia,
that came into effect with a recent appeals court order changing
the assassination conviction to premeditated murder.
   As Islamic law, based on the Moslems' holy book the Koran and
pronouncements of the Prophet Mohammed, does not deal with the
political crime of assassination.
   But the Sharia decrees that the family of a murder victim can
decide whether the convicted person should be executed, made to pay
restitution and be pardoned or be pardoned outright.
   Sudan News Agency said it was told that the court will order the
five Palestinians executed if the families do not appear at its
January hearing. The agency's source did not say what would happen
if families disagree on the fate of the defendants.
   When the Court of Appeal amended the charge, it said relatives
of Christopher Rolfe, who was killed, had pardoned the
perpetrators. In addition to Rolfe, the British victims were his
wife, Clare; their children, Thomas, 3, and Louise, 1; and Sally
Rockett, a teacher.

<HEAD>Parents Outraged Over Courter Ads About Their Son's Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The parents of a slain state trooper
say the Republican candidate for governor's campaign ignored their
wishes by invoking their son's name and using film of his funeral
in a commercial.
   ``They won't even let him rest in peace. That's all we want _
for him to rest in peace,'' Grace Lamonaco said in an interview
Monday. ``What kind of person could exploit a picture of a
funeral?''
   The 30-second television commercial for Republican James Courter
features a photograph of Philip Lamonaco, footage from his 1981
Christmas Eve funeral, and a brief interview with his widow, Donna.
   The widow urges viewers to support Courter on grounds that he
will pursue a stronger death penalty. She criticizes Democrat James
Florio for being satisfied with the existing death penalty law.
   The Lamonacos said the ad has reopened the wound of their son's
slaying. They said the Courter campaign knew they objected and say
their wishes should have been respected regardless of the
willingness of their daughter-in-law to appear in the ad.
   ``If it wasn't for the commercial, we wouldn't be going through
all this again,'' said Joseph Lamonaco, breaking into tears during
the interview at the couple's home. ``How can they bring something
like this up in a political campaign?''
   Ken Connolly, Courter's campaign manager, said Courter was not
told of the parents' objections.
   They parents also said the commercial is misleading because it
implies that their son's killers were spared the death penalty
because of a flaw in the law. The capital punishment law was not
enacted until 1982 _ a year after his slaying.
   Donna Lamonaco wrote a letter on pink stationery on behalf of
Courter during last spring's primary election. His campaign sent
the letter to thousands of Republican voters in a mailing that
included a snapshot of the dead trooper.
   When Lamonaco's parents heard of the letter, they called Courter
and told Connolly they did not want their son's name exploited for
political purposes.
   ``I thought he was going to be enough of a gentleman to stop
with the pictures. Then to jump on pictures of the funeral for
God's sake. How cold-hearted can you be?'' said Grace Lamonaco.
   Connolly said deciding whether to tape the commercial against
the parents' wishes was difficult. He said the failure of the
campaign to call the parents and warn them of the commercial was
``an oversight on my part.''
   Donna Lamonaco did not return a message left with the Courter
campaign. She has an unlisted telephone number. The campaign and
her family refused to give it out.
   Lamonaco was shot on Interstate 80. After a three-year manhunt,
police captured self-avowed revolutionaries Thomas Manning and
Richard Williams and charged them with the slaying. Manning was
convicted, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on Williams
and he is to be retried.
   Courter is running an uphill battle against Florio in the race
to succeed Republican Gov. Thomas Kean. Recent polls show Florio
ahead by 14 to 23 percentage points.

<HEAD>Danforth Introduces Living Will Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospitals and nursing homes would have to
inform patients of their right to have ``living wills'' that spell
out the intensity of medical treatment they desire when nearing
death under legislation introduced Tuesday in the Senate.
   ``For many people, the last months of their lives realize the
nightmares of their earlier years,'' Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
said at a news conference where he unveiled the legislation.
   The nightmare, he said, is ``that modern medicine is capable of
prolonging the process of death for interminable periods of time;
that every shred of dignity is kept from human beings; that people
who have lived wonderful lives are required, through no decision of
their own, to vegetate.''
   Danforth said 40 states have living will laws, but only 9
percent of Americans execute such documents.
   He suggested that is more from Americans' lack of awareness
about such matters rather than their lack of desire to have a say
about what is done if they reach the point where life support
systems are needed to keep them alive.
   Danforth's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y., would require all states to have living will legislation,
but would not spell out the provisions such measures must contain.
   However, it would require that hospitals and nursing homes that
accept Medicare and Medicaid payments _ in essense every such
institution in the nation _ inform patients when they check in
about that particular state's laws.
   Hospitals would also have to point out that patients have the
right to designate someone to make decisions about their health
care if the patient becomes unable to make such decisions.
   Danforth compared the disclosure to a sort of medical version of
the ``Miranda warning'' police must give people they arrest.
   Danforth said he expects debate over his bill to encourage
people to make decisions before they become ``vulnerable to the
decisions of medical technocrats.''

<HEAD>Hunter Charged For Shooting Moose _ In Iowa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNDERWOOD, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moose that caught the fancy of Iowans
as it wandered southward for weeks, hundreds of miles south of its
normal range, has been killed by a hunter who claimed self defense.
   ``Everyone is appalled that the moose was shot because everyone
has been watching him from day one,'' Doug Clayton, a conservation
officer for the state Department of Natural Resources, said Tuesday.
   The moose had been wandering southward through Iowa since first
being seen Sept. 22 near Sheldon. The moose's wanderings had taken
him to downtown Cherokee and into many Iowa corn fields.
   Michael Scott Wiggins, 27, of Underwood, was cited Tuesday in
Pottawattamie County District Court for shooting an animal out of
season _ there are normally no moose in Iowa and therefore no
hunting season _ and having a center-fire rifle in his possession
during a deer hunting season restricted to muzzle-loading guns.
   Both citations are simple misdemeanors with a maximum penalty of
$100 fine or 30 days in jail, said Assistant County Attorney Tim
Markel. The state will also seek $1,000 in damages, he said.
Arraignment was set for Oct. 20.
   Wiggins, who notified Iowa Department of Natural Resources
officials about the shooting Sunday, said he encountered the bull
moose in a soybean field east of Underwood, about 10 miles northest
of Council Bluffs in southwestern Iowa, Clayton said.
   Clayton investigated the shooting and said he is skeptical about
Wiggins' claim that he shot the moose after it charged him.
   ``He said the moose was charging north to south, but we found
moose tracks going east to west,'' Clayton said. He also said the
animal had not been killed with ``head-on shots.''
   Clayton said Wiggins told him he had been hunting for a coyote
with his .270-caliber Magnum rifle in his father's soybean field
when he looked up and saw the moose charging him.
   Richard McGeough, chief of the department's enforcement bureau,
said he also found it hard to accept Wiggins' explanation.
   ``These animals routinely travel through the state, and people
line up on the highways and gawk and take pictures,'' he said.
``And of all these reports, the people who shoot the moose are the
only ones who say the moose charged them.''
   Only three other moose, all bulls, have been reported in the
state in the last dozen years. Their natural habitat is about 400
miles north of Iowa, in the lakes and forests of northern
Minnesota. Underwood is about 150 south of the Minnesota state line.
   Wiggins could not be reached for comment; there was no answer at
his father's house.
   Officials said the moose would be stuffed and used in an
educational display at the Springbrook State Park north of Guthrie
Center.
   State wildlife specialist Lee Gladfelder said the best theory is
that the wandering bulls lost a contest for mating rights and were
rejected by the rest of the herd.
   But why some of the beasts travel south is a mystery, he said.
Of the other three moose in Iowa, one was shot by a farmer who was
fined for killing a protected animal, one died of natural causes
and one wandered on to Missouri and disappeared.

   Authorities on Tuesday freed a former

after reportedly criticizing the military government.
   Tam David-West refused to comment on his detention except to
say, ``Wherever I was, I was treated very well.''
   The Daily Champion, an independent newspaper, reported he was

   The independent newspaper said David-West, a professor of
virology, was picked up Oct. 11 in Ibadan, where he teaches at the
University of Ibadan, 60 miles north of Lagos.
   The newspaper said he had been held under Decree No. 2, which
allows the detention of anyone deemed a threat to state security or

   The paper did not say how David-West had criticized the
government. No other details were available.

<HEAD>Cavazos' Choice Pitch Gets Tangled in East Harlem School Funding
Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's education secretary said Tuesday
that letting parents pick their child's school is the ``cornerstone
of education reform.'' But East Harlem parents and a state educator
told him ``choice is not enough.''
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos was in the city's East
Harlem neighborhood to lavish praise on its impoverished school
district which has gained fame for transforming crowded schools
into 52 smaller magnet schools aimed at providing educational
options.
   But the choice-in-education message Cavazos hoped to convey in
the first stop of a five-city road show became mired in politics as
parents demanded an explanation for the loss of $1.4 million in
federal magnet funds for their district _ the very funds designed
to encourage the choice programs Cavazos was praising.
   At a 2{-hour meeting Monday night at Intermediate School 117,
parents told Cavazos and city and state education officials that
choice without adequate funding holds only hollow promise for
improving schools.
   ``The irony is that we're celebrating choice at a time when
we're in a crisis in this district. Instead of increased support,
we're getting less support,'' said Ray Rivera, who has two children
in the district's schools.
   At Tuesday's concluding session, some speakers stressed that
expanding parental choice alone would not cure school ills.
   ``At the risk of being branded an infidel, choice is not
enough,'' said New York State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol.
``Adequate resources need to be provided. When the average
elementary class size in New York City is 28, and outside the city
it is 22, the quality of choice outside the city is likely to be
greater. And that has to end.''
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, who delivered one of the final
speeches of the conference, said: ``Choice isn't the be all and end
all. But there are too many schools that just don't work. Choice is
the passageway to get from the schools of today to the schools of
tomorrow.''
   Cavazos himself said choice was just ``one of the strategies''
needed. But he later told reporters: ``Choice by itself is a
stimulus. It creates competitive interaction.''
   President Bush has called choice ``the single most promising
idea'' in education today. He and others argue that if parents are
given the chance to choose schools, the resulting competition will
improve education everywhere.
   At Tuesday's session, an East Harlem group called ``Parents For
Choice'' distributed leaflets saying they had been told by
Education Department officials that the district's magnet fund
grant proposal ``was weak and inadequate and therefore funds were
not provided this year.''
   The district had received federal magnet grants the last two
years. Without those funds, district officials have said 30
teaching and other staff jobs are in jeopardy.
   Education Undersecretary Ted Sanders told reporters that the
quality of magnet fund applications has improved making competition
stiffer and that Congress wants preference given to new applicants.
   Lon Anderson, a spokesman for the department, said Cavazos had
nothing to do with awarding grants and the rejection of East
Harlem's bid ``was absolutely no reflection on the quality of
education programs in the district.''
   Cavazos's visit was the first of five regional meetings on
parental choice planned by the Bush administration. The other
scheduled stops are in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Oct. 23-24; Charlotte,
N.C., Nov. 13-14; Denver, Nov. 16-17; and Richmond, Calif., Nov.
28-29.
   In 1972, East Harlem's Community School District 4 ranked last
among the city's 32 local school districts in standardized test
scores, and only 15 percent were reading at grade level. Today,
with parents able to choose among 52 magnet schools, 66 percent are
reading at grade level and the district's citywide rank has
improved to 16th.

   A storage tank containing a toxic
chemical exploded and caught fire Tuesday, killing three
maintenance workers and injuring three, police said.
   The tank of the Paktank company, in Rotterdam's Botlek port
area, exploded at midmorning while the crew was working on it,
according to police spokesman Hans Stoop. He said it took
firefighters four hours to control the blaze.
   The cause of the blast was not immediately known, Stoop said.
   The tank contained 250 tons of acrylonytril, a highly flammable
and toxic chemical used in the plastics industry, the spokesman
said.
   Nearby residents were advised to keep their windows closed for
several hours, but no evacuations were necessary, Stoop said.

   President Bush promised anew Tuesday to help
defend South Korea against its communist neighbor. He also nudged
President Roh Tae Woo to open South Korea's markets wider to
American competition.
   The two leaders concluded 2{-hours of meetings and a luncheon at
the White House with pledges to keep U.S. troops there to help
maintain peace on the Korean peninsula.
   Bush pledged, ``our forces will remain as long as there is a
threat from the North.'' He also applauded Roh's ``creative
diplomacy'' in proposing to create a commonwealth between North and
South Korea ``as a step toward reunification.''
   On trade, the thorniest issue between the two allies, Bush said,
``South Korea is now the world's 10th largest trading nation and
America's seventh largest trading partner.
   ``Korean workers and companies have benefited from U.S. open
markets, but American workers and companies deserve equal access to
Korean markets,'' Bush said at the ceremony in the East Room, with
their wives and top Cabinet members standing nearby.
   Roh, speaking through an interpreter, said: ``I emphasized to
President Bush that in spite of many domestic difficulties, the
Korean government, with strong faith in free and fair trade, has
been moving toward economic liberalization and market opening.''
   What had been scheduled as a 10-minute private meeting between
the two leaders lasted 40 minutes, and they spent another 30
minutes with Cabinet officials and top aides before a working
luncheon.
   Richard Solomon, an assistant secretary of state who briefed
reporters afterwards, said that at one point, Roh used the
``analogy that if an apple is picked before it is ripe, it can be a
bit tough and sour. When it's ripe, however, it's nice and sweet.''
   But Bush rejoined, ``We don't want the ripening to take so long
that we're too old to enjoy the food.''
   Solomon said Roh ``indicated that he will continue to
liberalize,'' with a goal of making South Korea's market as open by
the mid-1990s as markets are now in the major Western industrial
nations.
   Roh also noted that the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea was
down in August by a third from last year's level.
   Bush ``indicated his hopes for rapid progress in the areas of
telecommunications and implementation of intellectual property
rights,'' Solomon said.
   Asked about the prospects for getting more U.S. agricultural
goods into South Korea, Solomon said, ``That's an area where it may
take _ from the Korean perspective _ a little longer for the apple
to ripen.''
   Bush said ``the division of Korea is merely a part of a great
divide between all the nations of the world.''
   Roh said both he and Bush ``shared the view that a new breeze of
reform and openness currently blowing ... (is) spreading freedom in
the socialist world.''
   ``We noted the stark reality, however, that despite this
encouraging trend of change, confrontation and tension have not
abated on the Korean Peninsula,'' said Roh.
   Talk of a reduced U.S. military deployment has become more
commonplace as South Korea becomes more prosperous and the Soviet
Union appears less menacing than before. Moscow has close links to
Seoul's arch-rival, North Korea.
   South Korea has made strides toward democracy in the past two
years, but human rights groups claim there has been an increase in
repression lately. Roh has defended the arrest of several hundred
dissidents in recent months, saying they had violated the law.
   Six anti-American radicals staged a bold attack on the U.S.
ambassador's residence in Seoul last week.
   The White House was ringed with police as several dozen young
Koreans demonstrated in nearby Lafayette Park in protest of the Roh
visit.
   Bush met with Roh in Seoul last February, a month after Bush's
inauguration. Roh will have breakfast with Vice President Dan
Quayle before addressing a joint session of Congress Wednesday. His
five-day visit to the United States ends Thursday.

otherwise be forced to return to their native countries, including
thousands to the Philippines.
   The bill, approved by voice vote and sent to the Senate, would
exempt the nurses from the ceilings on visa allotments because of
the current shortage of nurses in this country.
   To be covered by the bill, a person would have to prove he or
she was employed as a nurse for at least three years in the United

   The bill also includes a pilot program for admission of

   Stocks prices retreated today following two of
the wildest sessions on Wall Street since the October 1987 market
crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 18.65 points
to 2,638.73 after being down as much as 63 points around 11:30 a.m.
Broader market indicators also fell.
   The closely watched Dow had ended a volatile day of trading
Monday with a gain of 88.12 points, or 3.4 percent, at 2,657.38 _
the fourth-biggest point rise on record. Volume was the
fourth-largest in history, with 416.29 million shares changing hand.
   The Monday rally erased about half of Friday's 190.58-point
plunge, the worst decline since the Black Monday crash of Oct. 19,
1987.
   The Commerce Department reported today that the nation's trade
shortfall increased to $10.77 billion in August, up 30.77 percent
from a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion. Many economists had
expected the deficit to be about $9 billion.
   Larry Wachtel, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., attributed today's retreat largely to concerns that the U.S.
trade deficit was worsening and could lead to higher interest rates.
   But not all analysts agreed that the trade deficit was a major
factor in today's decline. Some noted that bonds and the dollar _
which are most sensitive to bad trade figures _ held up relatively
well.
   The dollar recovered after a sharp drop that followed the trade
report, while bonds were mixed _ an indication that investors were
not seriously worried about worsening inflation and higher interest
rates.
   The Federal Reserve injected $1.5 billion into the banking
system today after adding $2 billion in reserves on Monday.
   Banks will be able to use the new reserves to come to the
assistance of brokerage firms caught in a cash squeeze because of
the drop in stock prices.
   Traders were worried about the outlook for the
employee-management buyout proposal for the parent of United
Airlines. The stock fell another $25.67{ a share to $197.25 after
tumbling about $57 a share Monday, and that contributed to the
overall market weakness.
   In the overall New York Stock Exchange today, declining issues
outpaced advances by almost 3 to 2. Volume totaled a
heavier-than-usual 224.07 million shares, with the heaviest action
in the early going.
   Monday's rally was concentrated in blue-chip stocks, which
benefited from a ``flight to quality'' among nervous investors
while many smaller issues continued to lose ground.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 5-to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange. Indexes of the American Stock
Exchange and over-the-counter stocks fell.
   Friday's plunge had raised fears of a repeat of Oct. 19, 1987,
when a Friday decline turned into a Monday rout that knocked a
record 508 points off the Dow average. That did not turn out to be
the case.
   Stocks rallied today in Tokyo in response to Wall Street's
strength of Monday, but London's market lost ground in sympathy
with today's weakness on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In Tokyo, where Tuesday trading ended before New York opened for
business, the Nikkei average jumped 527.39 points, or 1.5 percent,
to 34,996.08. It was the second-biggest gain this year and erased
most of Monday's 647.33-point decline.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
fell 27.9 points, or more than 1 percent, to close at 2,135.5.
   Traders said the stock market benefited from the experience
gained in the 1987 crash. The New York Stock Exchange managed to
handle the heavy volume because of a big investment in technology
made after Black Monday 1987.
   In addition, traders were soothed by a promise during the
weekend by the Federal Reserve to supply fresh money to the
financial system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing
to traders who lost money.
   It turned out that little Fed action was necessary.
   Turmoil continued in the airline sector. Donald Trump announced
he was withdrawing his $7 billion bid for AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines, after the company's stock fall. He said he would
consider making a lower offer.
   It was a failure to obtain financing for an employee-management
buyout of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that sparked Friday's
plunge. A spokesman for British Airways, which is backing the
buyout group, said the group planned to pursue a takeover, although
the terms of the deal were under review.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Commemorates Armenian Massacre</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Tuesday
to commemorate the massacre of more than a million Armenians 75
years ago, approving a resolution sure to anger Turkey and the Bush
administration.
   Before passing the measure on an 8-6 vote, the panel rejected an
effort by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to soften its language by
eliminating the word ``genocide.''
   Metzenbaum said he offered his substitute at the suggestion of
Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser.
Scowcroft met Monday with Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the resolution's
sponsor, to discuss the issue.
   The Dole measure would set April 24, 1990, to memorialize the
1.5 million Armenians who were killed between 1915 and 1923 during
the Ottoman Empire.
   The Bush administration, concerned that the resolution could
damage relations between the United States and Turkey, lobbied
behind the scenes to defeat the measure, even bringing back the
U.S. ambassador to work against it.
   Publicly, however, the State Department took no position on the
resolution.
   President Bush found himself in a jam over the resolution
because he had voiced support for language marking the ``Armenian
genocide'' during the 1988 campaign.
   The measure, which now goes to the Senate floor, aroused strong
feelings among Americans of Turkish and Armenian ancestry.
   ``I became the focal point for the greatest lobbying campaign
I've experienced in a long while,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Metzenbaum suggested replacing the word genocide with a
``national day of remembrance'' for Armenians.
   Genocide means a ``deliberate and systematic'' elimination of a
racial group, he said. ``I don't think that's really what occurred
here.'' Some historians have rejected the idea of a genocide.
   But Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
said, ``The only debate is whether it was attempted genocide or
genocide.''
   And Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said ``people were massacred
because of their ancestry,'' in the Ottoman Empire.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, failed in his attempt to transfer the
resolution to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying the
Judiciary Committee did not have the expertise to understand the
foreign policy ramifications of the measure.
   The Turkish government had strongly opposed the resolution,
believing it was tantamount to comparing that nation's history to
Nazi Germany.

   Dry weather helped farmers take a big bite out
of field work the past week, including rapid progress in the fall
harvests of corn and soybeans, the government's Joint Agricultural
Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``Rain was needed in the Great Plains to promote winter wheat
emergence and development,'' the facility said in its report.
``Soil moisture was short to adequate in the Great Plains and most
of the West, and adequate in the East. Soil moisture was adequate
to short in the Delta.''
   The facility, operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, reported that by the end of the Oct. 9-15 week an
estimated 81 percent of the winter wheat had been planted, nine
percentage points ahead of normal.
   About 46 percent of the corn had been harvested, two points
ahead of normal, and 55 percent of the soybeans, eight points ahead.
   The cotton harvest, however, was only 23 percent completed, nine
points behind the normal pace.

<HEAD>Soviets Abstain on Seating Israel, Still Oppose Its Mideast Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Soviet Union abstained Tuesday on the
annual vote to seat Israel, instead of opposing it as usual, but
tempered the sign of better relations by repeating its disapproval
of Israeli policy in the Middle East.
   It was the first time since 1982 the Soviets did not join Arab
nations in voting to reject Israel's credentials for the 159-member
General Assembly. Israel has been U.N. member since the Jewish
state was founded in 1948.
   The vote in the assembly was 95-37 to seat Israel, with 15
abstentions and 12 nations not voting. Last year's vote was 95-41,
with seven abstentions and 16 absent.
   Credentials of all nations must be approved each year and the
annual challenge to Israel has become a ritual.
   Although the Kremlin did not support Israel, the changed vote
was considered a victory for the Israelis and a setback for the
Arabs.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov said later his
government had given ``a signal to the government of Israel that it
is high time to listen to the world community'' and heed U.N.
resolutions on the Middle East.
   ``The ball is in Israel's court and it is up to them to make
their assessement and take certain concrete decisions,'' he said.
   Belonogov said dropping opposition to Israel's credentials did
not mean a change in Soviet views on Israel's Middle East policy or
presage resumption of the diplomatic relations severed in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Israeli ``intransigence'' in Middle East peace efforts and its
refusal to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization make
resumption of formal ties impossible despite warmer unofficial
relations, he said.
   Israeli diplomats had said the Soviet vote would be a test of
its intention to improve relations and play a constructive role in
the Middle East peace process.
   Byelorussia and the Ukraine, the Soviet Union's other two votes
in the General Assembly, joined the switch. Turkey, which abstained
last year, supported Israel in Tuesday's vote.
   Ambassador Johanan Bein of Israel called the Soviet change of
heart ``a move in the right direction; yes, definitely positive.''
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens issued a statement
praising ``the positive attitude of the Soviet Union that found
expression'' in the vote.
   Clovis Maksoud, representative of the Arab League, described the
new Soviet position on the challenge to Israel as ``regrettable,'
but called it a ``tactical change'' that did not alter Moscow's
support for the Arab position.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, a former ambassador to
Israel, said: ``The Soviet abstention is a good sign. A `yes' vote
would have been better.''

   Sir David Lean, the 81-year-old English
director, says he thinks he's persuaded Marlon Brando to play a
brutish South American general in his next film.
   The movie is based on Joseph Conrad's novel ``Nostromo,'' the
story of how the lust for silver corrupts and destroys a host of
characters living in a fictional South American nation.
   ``I'm terribly excited because it looks very much as if we'll
have Marlon Brando in one of the parts,'' Lean told The New York
Times by telephone from London in an interview published Tuesday.
``I think he's probably the greatest film actor ever. I wanted him
for `Lawrence (of Arabia)' and for `Ryan's Daughter.'''
   Lean said the part for which he wants the reclusive Brando is
``a villain called Montero, which he can do off the back of his
hand and make it very interesting and rather funny, too.''

   Motorcyclists and state officials joined
Tuesday in opposing legislation to withhold some federal highway
aid from states without mandatory automobile seat-belt and
motorcycle helmet laws.
   The cyclists told a hearing of a Senate Environment and Public
Works subcommittee that most states either have helmet laws or are
on their way to doing so. The cyclists also argued that riders'
edcuation programs have helped reduce fatalities over the last
eight years by 35 percent.
   ``Issues of highway safety and personal freedom have
traditionally and rightfully been resolved by state governments,
and the imposition (of the proposed law) is a violation of state's
rights,'' said Robert Rasor, vice president for governmental
relations of the American Motorcyclist Association of Westerville,
Ohio.
   At issue is legislation sponsored by Sen. John R. Chafee,
R-R.I., to empower the Transportation Department to withhold up to
10 percent of a state's federal highway aid unless it required
motorcylists to wear helmets and all front-seat automobile
passengers to wear safety belts.
   Chafee said that nearly 50,000 people are killed on the highways
each year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
estimates that 20,000 lives have been saved over the last five
years through the wearing of motorcycle helmets and automobile
safety belts.
   Public health groups, physicians and the insurance industry
support Chafee's proposal.
   ``Our taxes pay more than $9 billion each toward the care of
injured motor vehicle occupants and motorcyclists,'' Susan P. Baker
of the Johns Hopkins Injury Prevention Center in Baltimore told the
subcommittee on water resources, transportation and infrastructure.
   But represenatives of state government and other opponents of
sanctions contained in the proposed ``National Highway Fatality and
Injury Reduction Act of 1989'' argued that the sanctions would be
counterproductive.
   ``Adding to the list of ways in which a state can jeopardize
funding for transportation, including safety, only limits the
state's ability to find the most effective combination of laws,
regulations and educational efforts to encourage driver and
passenger safety,'' said Virginia state Sen. Charles Wadell,
representing the National Conference of State Legislators.
   Robert Ford of the Massachusetts-based ``Freedom First'' group,
which fought successfully for repeal of that state's seat-belt law,
argued that reducing highway aid would make roads more hazardous.
   The insurance industry's Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
says that only 16 states don't now have mandatory seat-belt laws.
   Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have helmet laws
applying to all riders. Three states _ Colorado, Illinois and Iowa
_ don't have helmet laws. The rest have laws covering riders under
a certain age, which varies from state to state.

   The 49-nation Commonwealth of
Britain and its former colonies opens its biennial summit
Wednesday, divided over whether to toughen sanctions on South
Africa or give it six months to make racial reforms.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain will make the
opening speech and argue against stronger sanctions or a deadline
for reform in South Africa, which quit the Commonwealth in 1961.
   The African National Congress, the main group fighting white
domination in South Afrida, urged the Commonwealth to impose more
sanctions and indicated its hit-and-run guerrilla attacks may
change.
   ``It is very important ... to pay attention to the question of
building up the military capacity to conduct a sustained armed
struggle, not merely to carry out an operation once in a while,
however spectacular,'' said Thabo Mbeki, the organization's
spokesman on foreign affairs.
   Mrs. Thatcher is likely to dominate the 40th anniversary summit
as she has in the past.
   Many delegates said they were prepared to give South Africa's
new president, F.W. de Klerk, six months to deliver on promises of
radical reforms following Sunday's release of several leading black
nationalists.
   British officials said Mrs. Thatcher felt a deadline would be
``wholly artificial.''
   ``You're not going to solve the South African question in six
months. It's going to take some time,'' one said.
   Commonwealth countries have led the push for international
action against apartheid, South Africa's official policy of racial
segregation.
   Britain says recent progress toward political settlements in
Namibia, Angola and Mozambique should not be jeopardized by forcing
South Africa into a corner.
   ``The way forward is not to set it back and not to put artifical
deadlines upon people,'' the official said. ``You must allow the
reform process to go forward to prove its worth.''
   Sir Shridath Ramphal, Commonwealth secretary-general, indicated
in a briefing before Mrs. Thatcher's arrival that environmental
issues might eclipse the South Africa question. He said
environmental problems were of such wide concern, ``it could be in
some respects a crisis agenda.''
   After her arrival and meetings of British officials with other
delegations, however, it became clear Mrs. Thatcher wanted South
Africa at the top of the list for the conference in the Putra World
Trade Center on the Klang River.
   The summit, which does not take formal votes on issues, runs
until Oct. 24.

   Lawmakers and Bush administration officials
clashed Tuesday over President Bush's war on illegal drugs, with
some congressmen complaining about unrealistic goals and confusion
over the duties of government agencies.
   Representatives of the Defense Department, Customs Service and
Coast Guard told two House Government Operations subcommittees that
the administration has made progress in stemming the flow of drugs
into the United States.
   ``I have spent 60 percent of my time on the drug war this
year,'' said Gen. Thomas Kelly, director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``I assure you our attention has been
gotten.''
   The general said the commanders in chief of the Unified and
Specified Commands have completed their proposals for the drug war.
Last month, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney asked military leaders to
draw up plans by Oct. 15 for using ships, planes, radar and troops
in the fight against illicit drugs.
   Kelly said Cheney and the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be briefed
on the proposals later this week with a final plan expected
sometime later. No date was given.
   Kelly said he was not at liberty to discuss the proposals but
did confirm earlier reports that the United States will use its
ships in the drug war.
   ``We will have battle groups in the future in the Caribbean,''
said Kelly, who spoke of achieving the goals set by the president.
   But members of the subcommittee on legislation and national
security and the panel on government information, justice and
agriculture expressed reservations about the administration's
policy.
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the full committee,
questioned Bush's recent stated goal to reduce drug imports by 10
percent in two years and 50 percent over 10 years.
   ``Ten percent of what?'' Conyers asked.
   Michael Lane, acting commissioner of the Customs Service, said
the agency has asked William Bennett, head of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, for clarification on what the base
will be for judging reductions.
   Shortly after Conyers' comment, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., and
Stephen Duncan, the Defense Department's coordinator for drug
enforcement policy and support, got into a heated exchange over
whether the Pentagon is usurping the Customs Service as the top
agency in the drug war.
   ``Has this administration changed the directive of the previous
administration? ... In May 1987, Customs was the lead agency for
interdiction,'' English said.
   Duncan said the Bush administration has not changed the
directive. He also emphasized that the various agencies ``don't get
into whose under and whose over in day-to-day operations.''
   Englsh persisted, asking ``Who determines where we're putting
our resources?''
   Duncan stressed that the Defense Department is the lead agency
for detection and monitoring but Customs remains the chief
department for interdiction.

<HEAD>Journalists Threaten Strike After Gorbachev Rebuke</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet journalists threatened a strike and a group
of legislators on Tuesday accused President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of
using ``pressure tactics'' in his rebuke of some prominent,
outspoken editors.
   The 58-year-old Kremlin leader, facing growing public discontent
over economic decline despite his reforms, lashed out at the press
at a time when it is providing increasingly frank coverage of the
country's problems.
   The attack came at a closed-door meeting and appeared to be an
attempt by the leadership to regain a measure of control over the
media, which daily carry reports critical of the system and
occasionally of its leaders.
   Soviet journalists said Gorbachev accused the editors of working
against the Communist Party or of seeking his political downfall at
a time when the nation is being torn by economic crisis, ethnic
strife and calls from some quarters for secession from the union.
   One journalist said Gorbachev likened the situation in the
country to a lake of gasoline that could be set afire by a single
match. He was quoted as saying the people need moral guidance from
the media in this critical period.
   Since coming to power in March 1985, Gorbachev has repeatedly
called for more open expression and has relaxed some political
control over the media. But he also has said his policy of
glasnost, or openness, has limits. He has condemned extremist views
appearing in the media.
   The journalists, speaking on condition they not be identified,
told Western colleagues Gorbachev's accusations came at a top-level
meeting Friday with representatives of state media, creative unions
and agencies charged with formulating ideology at the Communist
Party Central Committee. It could mean the frank criticism spawned
by glasnost may now be ruled off limits, they said.
   The Soviet public has not been told of Gorbachev's remarks. The
official news agency Tass reported Gorbachev spoke, but the text
was not distributed and no details appeared in the Soviet press.
   The journalists said Gorbachev aimed some of his toughest
criticism at Vladislav A. Starkov, editor of the weekly tabloid
Arguments and Facts, and suggested he resign. It is the country's
most popular newspaper, with a circulation of 26 million. Gorbachev
also demanded he be given all letters critical of him that were
sent to the newspaper.
   Using readers' mail, Arguments and Facts recently calculated
that human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was more popular than
Gorbachev or any other member of the Soviet Congress.
   Starkov was given an additional dressing-down at a meeting
Monday with chief party ideologist Vadim A. Medvedev, the
journalists said. They said Medvedev also told Starkov he must go
and offered him a job at the state publishing committee, but
Starkov will fight to stay put.
   Journalists at Arguments and Facts said they are considering a
walk-out after completing work on next week's issue unless
Gorbachev backs off, and hope other journalists would join them.
   Nikolai A. Kutsenko, a member of the Supreme Soviet, the
national legislature, gathered at least 30 lawmakers' signatures
Tuesday on a petition to Gorbachev defending Arguments and Facts.
   It accuses Gorbachev of using ``pressure tactics'' against the
newspaper that it said conflict with his drive to democraticize
Soviet society. It also accuses Gorbachev of trying to discredit
the weekly.
   Arguments and Facts was responsible for several sensational
stories in the past year, including the first Soviet disclosure
that dictator Josef Stalin imprisoned or killed as many as 40
million people. It was the first Soviet publication to print
excerpts of the memoirs of Nikita S. Khrushchev, the late former
prime minister.
   Soviet journalists quoted their bosses who attended as saying
Gorbachev also tore into some other stars, including Ogonyok weekly
editor-in-chief Vitaly Korotich, historian Yuri Afanasyev and
reformist economists Gavriil Popov and Nikolai Shmelev.
   He accused Afanasyev, Popov and Shmelev _ members of the
legislature's opposition group _ of joining with populist Communist
legislator Boris N. Yeltsin to form ``a fascist clique striving for
power,'' they said.
   Gorbachev reportedly said that Afanasyev, rector of Moscow
Historical Archives Institute, should be thrown out of the
Communist Party.
   One source described the president as shouting when he accused
Korotich of breaking a personal promise not to mention Yeltsin in
print.
   Gorbachev also reportedly called the editorial board of the
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper ``a nest of informal, antiparty
organizations.'' The paper is published by the Komsomol Young
Communist League in Moscow.

<HEAD>Census Adjustment Agreement Poses Problems, House Panel Told</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   States may be faced with two sets of numbers
for congressional redistricting under a court agreement aimed at
adjusting the 1990 census for an historical undercount of
minorities, a House panel was told Tuesday.
   The potential of two sets of figures also may influence whether
the commerce secretary makes the adjustment official, Daniel
Melnick and David Huckabee told the House Post Office subcommittee
on census and population.
   The panel is studying whether legislation is needed to correct
any problems with last July's court agreement over the census
adjustment. The agreement stemmed from a lawsuit seeking to force
the Commerce Department to adjust the census for its historical
undercount of minorities.
   The Census Bureau has been criticized for missing from 1 percent
to 2 percent of the population in the 1980 census, and as much as 5
percent of minorities, because some people do not respond to
questionnaires or refuse to cooperate with canvassers.
   New York City, for instance, has estimated that the 1980 census
missed up to 500,000 of its residents, costing the city $52 million
a year in federal funds that are awarded on the basis of
population. The census figures are also used to determine the
number of congressional seats that states gain or lose.
   In a report analyzing the agreement, Melnick and Huckabee, who
work for the Congressional Research Service of the Library of
Congress, raised key questions about it.
   Questions included whether states should begin drawing district
lines with initial counts or wait until the (commerce) secretary
decides whether to adjust the figures.
   By law, the Census Bureau must provide the president with an
overall national head count by Dec. 31, 1990, and the states with
localized breakdowns by April 1, 1991.
   Under the July agreement, however, the Census Bureau will also
perform a follow-up survey of 150,000 households to find and
correct any undercount. If the commerce secretary decides to make
the adjustment official, the adjusted numbers would be released to
the states no later than July 15, 1991.
   The government analysts also raised the question of whether
states should change the dates by which they must adopt new
district guidelines.
   ``To effect these changes, should states change the dates of
their primaries in 1992 or the dates by which candidates must file
their intention to run?'' the report asked.

   A data bank to help hospitals and other
health-care providers keep track of incompetent physicians,
dentists and other practitioners is due to go on line early next
year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday.
   The National Practitioner Data Bank ``will reduce the ability of
incompetent medical practitioners to avoid scrutiny by moving to
another jurisdiction,'' but will protect confidentiality, HHS
Secretary Louis Sullivan said.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group said the data bank was
``a good thing,'' but complained that the information in it would
not be available to most of the public.
   Lynn Soffer, a research associate with the health group, said
access to the information would be limited to hospitals, licensing
boards and other health-care entities and to individuals who are
subjects of reports.
   ``I think some basic information should be available to the
public from the bank,'' Soffer said. ``If a patient knows their
doctor was kicked off the staff, they deserve to have some basic
information on this.''
   The data bank will contain information concerning malpractice
payments made on behalf of physicians, dentists and other
health-care practitioners, as well as information on actions taken
by state boards against the licenses of physicians and dentists.
   Hospitals and other health-care facilities and professional
societies will be required to report their review actions
concerning professional competence or conduct that affect the
clinical privileges or membership of physicians or other
health-care practitioners. Reports must be made within 30 days from
the date of the payment or action.
   Also, hospitals must consult the data bank each time a
physician, dentist or other health-care practitioner applies for a
medical staff position or clinical privileges. Hospitals also must
request information every two years on the practitioners on its
medical staff and those who have clinical privileges.
   The data bank will be operated by UNISYS Corp. under a
five-year, $15.9 million contract.

   The Bush administration wants to require
automobile companies to manufacture, but not necessarily sell, cars
that burn cleaner fuels than gasoline, an Environmental Protection
Agency official said Tuesday.
   Seeking to clarify the administration's position on a key
element of the president's clean air bill, William G. Rosenberg,
assistant EPA administrator for air and radiation, told a Senate
committee Bush opposes an amendment endorsed by a House
subcommittee last week.
   The amendment would eliminate Bush's requirement that automakers
build and sell a million cars a year to run on alternative fuels
such as methanol and compressed natural gas. The cars would be sold
in the nation's smoggiest cities.
   Lawmakers friendly to the auto and oil industries pushed the
amendment, which environmentalists said would weaken the bill.
   Confusion arose during last week's meeting of the House Energy
and Commerce environment subcommittee, which approved the amendment
12-10, when the administration appeared to send conflicting signals
on its position.
   Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu had told him the administration was neutral on the
amendment. But Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said EPA Administrator
William Reilly had voiced opposition.
   During Tuesday's hearing of the Senate Committee On Energy and
Natural Resources, Rosenberg said the administration would support
the House amendment only with major changes.
   Under the House amendment, sponsored by Reps. Ralph Hall,
D-Texas, and Jack Fields, R-Texas, automakers would have to certify
they could build the clean-fuel cars but would not have to make
them. Rosenberg said the administration wants the cars actually
built but would agree to drop the requirement that the autos be
sold.
   Automakers have fought the sales requirements, saying there is
no guarantee the public would buy the cars.
   The administration also wants the bill to establish a two-part
system for phasing in use of clean-fuel cars, Rosenberg said. For
the immediate future, cars burning a combination of gasoline and
clean fuels such as methanol would be acceptable. Over the long
term, EPA would establish auto emission standards based entirely on
clean fuel use.
   ``We are confident that with these changes, the Fields-Hall
amendment will achieve environmental benefits comparable to the
administration's proposal,'' Rosenberg said. ``Until these
adjustments are made part of the Fields-Hall amendment, the
administration continues to support the president's original
propsal in both the Senate and the House.''

   Environmental activists in Communist
Bulgaria have for the first time been allowed to campaign publicly
against a government industrial project in a scenic mountain area,
diplomats in that country said Tuesday.
   Observers speculated that Bulgarian authorities made the move to
create a positive impression at a 35-nation conference on the
European environment that opened Monday in Sofia.
   The diplomats, speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity,
said activists from the unsanctioned Eco-Glasnost group have worked
freely since Saturday in Sofia, Bulgaria's capital. They said at
least 1,400 signatures had been collected on petitions against the
project.
   Eco-Glasnost has been refused permission to register as an
official organization. It was formed after several hundred
activists got together last year to protest pollution in the Danube
River city of Ruse and to campaign for cleaner air in Sofia.
   Addressing the conference Tuesday, British chief delegate
Anthony Williams said, ``Eco-Glasnost has not been allowed to
register and ... some of its members have suffered harassment.''
   ``We urge the Bulgarian government to avoid ... harassment and
to allow (Eco-Glasnost) and other similar groups to carry out their
activities,'' a British diplomat in Sofia, reached by telephone,
quoted Williams as saying.
   The current petition campaign is directed against construction
of a hydrolectric plant in the Rila Mountains, about 75 miles
southwest of Sofia. The area is home to a 13th century monastery
famous for its painted icons.
   The government project was allowed despite official pledges in
the 1970s to keep the mountains a natural park and preserve.
   The Bulgarian environmental activists plan to present their
petitions to parliament and start legal action against the project,
a Bulgarian emigre said on condition of anonymity.
   The conference, the first of its kind, was being attended by the
35 signatories to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act: the United States,
Canada, the Soviet Union and European nations.
   Among topics on the agenda are preventive measures against
industrial accidents in border areas and pollution of international
waterways.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Navy technical team that
looked into the cause of the killer blast aboard the USS Iowa
believes it ``most probably'' was caused by a chemically ignited
explosive device, the Navy said Tuesday.
   Capt. Joseph D. Miceli headed the Navy team that conducted some
20,000 tests to determine the cause of the explosion that claimed
the lives of 47 sailors last April.
   Last month, the Navy issued a report on the blast but said it
was unable to cite a specific cause of the explosion.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Baker said the service stands by that
report.
   He said that while it is Miceli's personal opinion that a
chemically explosive device was used to set off the explosion, the
captain was unable to prove that was the case.
   ``He was not able to pin it down to a specific cause through the
tests,'' Baker said.
   ``It is Miceli's personal opinion that the cause of the Iowa
explosion was most probably a chemical device,'' the spokesman
said. ``However, he does not expect to be able to identify a
specific device as the cause of the explosion.''
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan issued the Navy's report on the
blast, saying its experts concluded that Gunner's Mate Clayton
Hartwig was the ``most likely person with the access, knowledge and
possible motivation'' to have set off the fireball in the
battleship's No. 2 gun turret.
   The Navy described Hartwig was a ``loner'' who was upset about
the breakup of a friendship with another sailor.
   Milligan said it appeared that Hartwig had placed ``some type''
of explosive device between the first and second bags of gunpowder,
but that he could not cite with certainty what made up the device.
   Under questioning by reporters, Milligan said it could have been
constructed of such simple materials as steel wool and hydraulic
brake fluid.
   Hartwig's family and some members of Congress have found fault
with the Navy's study and demanded a congressional investigation.
   On Tuesday, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said, ``I am tired
of seeing the Navy convict Clayton Hartwig on no evidence simply
because it does not have any idea as to what caused the tragic
explosion on the Iowa.''
   ``After conducting 20,000 tests of black powder and the
propellant used to fire the guns, the Navy has not produced any
evidence that an explosive device was placed in the gun, nor have
they produced a shred of evidence that Hartwig was responsible for
the explosion,'' the senator said.
   The Washington Post said in its Tuesday editions that
congressional sources say Navy experts have theorized that Hartwig
put something that would serve as an oxidizer, like some cleaning
powders, on a steel wool pad and then put something that would
serve as a fuel, like hydraulic brake fluid or hair cream, in a
plastic vial, knowing the two elements would ignite when combined.
   According to the theory reported in the Post, he then slipped
the combination into a lead foil sack that was inserted between the
first and second bags of gunpowder, and made sure the bags were
rammed deeper than usual into the gun barrel to ensure the vial
would break.
   Milligan decided to release his report last month after Navy
technical experts found ``foreign material'' in a ring inside the
barrel of the 16-inch gun that exploded, believing that was enough
evidence to make the case that the explosion was most probably
caused by human intervention, the Navy said.
   The Navy has continued to try to nail down the precise makeup of
the device that caused the explosion, and Baker said all of
Miceli's information ``had been shared'' with Milligan prior to his
release of the report.
   The Navy also said it has been cooperating with a General
Accounting Office study of its Navy report, which has been going on
for several weeks.

   The Senate Armed Services Committee indicated
Tuesday it planned to recommend full Senate confirmation of
President Bush's nominees to a new board overseeing safety in the
Energy Department's troubled nuclear weapons program.
   In a related development, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said
he was dispatching teams of independent inspectors to nuclear
weapons facilities in Missouri, Nevada and Ohio as part of a
continuing effort to root out environmental problems.
   The five nominees to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board
encountered no tough grilling in their brief Senate confirmation
hearing Tuesday. Several members said they were limiting their
questions because they wanted the board to start its work as soon
as possible.
   Panel members uniformly praised the nominees, but a vote was
delayed by Senate floor action.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, said the
board's role was ``critical to the future of safe operations'' at
the weapons complex, which includes 17 major production facilities
and laboratories in 12 states. Much of the system has been plagued
with management, technical and safety problems for several years.
   Congress created the safety board last year as a remedy to slack
oversight of the weapons program by the Energy Department, which
owns all the facilities but hires private companies to run them.
   The nominees are John T. Conway, recently retired executive vice
president of the New York utility Consolidated Edison; Edson G.
Case, a former official of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a
veteran of the nuclear Navy; John W. Crawford Jr., a 10-year
veteran of the Navy's nuclear propulsion program; Andrew J.
Eggenberger, a former engineer at the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory, and Herbert J.C. Kouts, an expert in U.S. and
international nuclear safety issues.
   Conway, who will be chairman of the panel if confirmed, said a
top priority of the group will be to oversee the Energy
Department's plan for restarting the tritium-producing nuclear
reactors at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C. The reactors
have been closed for more than a year for safety improvements.
   Conway said he also expected the panel to become involved
quickly in issues at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant
near Denver that is accused of serious environmental violations and
is overloaded with nuclear waste.
   In announcing plans to send environmental ``tiger teams'' to
three weapons sites later this month, Watkins said officials of the
Environmental Protection Agency and the states of Missouri, Ohio
and Nevada had been invited to observe the inspections. Watkins did
not say exactly when the investigations would begin.
   The sites to be inspected are the Kansas City Plant at Kansas
City, Mo., which produces non-nuclear components for the weapons
program; the Nevada Test Site, where underground nuclear weapons
tests are conducted, and the Portsmouth Uranium Enrichment plant at
Piketon, Ohio, which makes fuel for nuclear reactors.
   Watkins in recent months started similar investigations of
several other weapons plants.

   The Bush administration said Tuesday it is
seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on
American involvement in foreign coups that might result in the
death of a country's leader.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the proposed
changes would not alter a longstanding executive order banning U.S.
involvement in assassinations but would allow the CIA to have
contact with plotters of a coup in which a foreign leader might be
killed.
   ``There's a wide variety of interpretations and issues to be
discussed,'' Fitzwater said.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate intelligence
committee, said ``there is some vagueness'' in the policy. He said
he would welcome a request from Bush to ``clear up any ambiguity.''
   The issue took on new urgency in the wake of the failed coup
attempt against Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega on Oct. 3.
   Administration officials complained that CIA officers in Panama
were essentially prevented from advising the coup plotters because
of the possibility that Noriega might be killed.
   President Bush, at a news conference last week, signaled he
wanted to see the restrictions relaxed. ``I want as broad a power
as possible and I think under the Constitution, the president has
it,'' he said last Friday.
   Bush said his powers were ``broader than some in the Senate or
House might think,'' adding, ``I may have a difference with some on
interpreting what the powers of the president might be.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. William Cohen of Maine, senior Republican
on the Senate intelligence committee, said it may be time to review
the interpretation of the executive order on assassinations but
that the order, itself, should not be changed.
   ``I don't want to see us getting into the assassination business
by another name,'' Cohen said.
   Separately, Boren said he supported giving Bush ``any authority
that is truly needed to meet his responsibilities as commander in
chief.''
   Boren said, ``When anybody overthrows a government ... I don't
think that, by the farthest stretch of the imagination, should be
covered.''
   U.S. officials are extremely reluctant to publicly discuss
intelligence matters, particularly subjects such as coups and
assassinations. However, CIA Director William H. Webster, in an
interview with The New York Times, openly said he would like to see
the restrictions eased.
   Quickly endorsing the comments, Fitzwater said, ``We certainly
are in agreement with everything Judge Webster said yesterday.''
   ``What he said was that there are interpretations and
discussions and understandings with the Hill that should be
reconsidered in light of their impact on coup activities,'' the
spokesman added.
   Webster was quoted as saying he wanted rules devised so that CIA
officers' authority was so clearly defined that ``they can go right
up to the edge of that authority and not worry if they or their
agency is going to get into trouble.''
   Webster said that under the current interpretation of the
executive order, the United States could not devise a plan for the
assassination of Noriega or hire an individual or group who wants
to kill him.
   ``Now it begins to get a little tighter when you say, `Here's a
group that says it doesn't plan to kill him, but they're going to
have to play rough and it could happen,''' Webster said. ``Now
we're in the area that has to be addressed.''
   Fitzwater confirmed that the administration was discussing the
situation with congressional leaders, but said ``we're not willing
to talk about details'' publicly.
   However, asked whether he was talking about a situation in which
the United States would not carry out an assassination but might be
a party to a coup that might lead to the death of a foreign leader,
Fitzwater said, ``Yes, that's right.''
   The executive order prohibiting U.S. involvement in
assassination attempts was signed by President Ford in 1976 after
congressional investigations detailed the CIA's role in
assassination plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro and others.
   The order was strengthened by President Carter and adopted
without change by President Reagan.
   Bush invited the leaders of the Senate intelligence committee,
Boren and Cohen to the White House last week to stress that he
wants to work cooperatively with the panel.

   President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday shuttled
to Libya for a second day of mending fences with Moammar Gadhafi in
the neighboring land that no Egyptian leader had visited for 18
years.
   His trip came a day after the U.S. State Department appeared to
frown on his dialogue with Gadhafi, whom it accuses of backing
international terrorism.
   On Monday, the two leaders met at Egypt's Mediterranean resort
of Mersa Matruh. Gadhafi, who broke relations with Eygpt over its
peace initiatives with Israel, had not visited Egypt for 16 years.
The two countries fought a brief border war in 1977.
   The state-run Middle East New Agency reported that Mubarak flew
from Mersa Matruh to the eastern Libyan town of Tobruk on Tuesday.
   It said Gadhafi greeted Mubarak at Tobruk's Gamal Abdel Nasser
Air Base, named for Egypt's first president. The two leaders then
met privately at a local hotel, the report said.
   However, their were no details on their meeting. The agency said
Mubarak did not talk to reporters when he returned late Tuesday to
Cairo airport.
   The two leaders began their reconciliation in May, when they met
privately at an Arab summit in Morocco. The last time an Egyptian
leader went to Libya was when Anwar Sadat made the trip in 1971.
   Despite the latest talks, diplomatic relations remain severed.
Mubarak told reporters Monday night he had not raised the issue
with Gadhafi.
   After their meeting Monday, the two leaders announced only that
they were easing formalities for travel between their two countries.
   In her comments in Washington on Monday, U.S. State Department
spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said, ``Our position on Libya, its
support for terrorism and other regional activities involving
destabilization, is well known.'' She added, ``We have made known
to Egypt our views and concerns.''
   In other remarks Tuesday in Libya, Mubarak criticized Syria for
allowing a radical Palestinian group to ``insult'' Egypt from its
soil, the Middle East News Agency said.
   Asked if relations with Syria could improve as they did with
Libya, Mubarak said, ``I know President Hafez Assad (of Syria)
well, and I know others there well, and there is no problem with
them except that I blame them for letting George Habash insult
Egypt from Damascus.''
   Mubarak was referring to a warning made in the Syrian capital on
Oct. 9 by Habash, chief of the Marxist-oriented Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.
   In his comments, Habash rejected a plan put forward by Mubarak
for Middle East peace.
   He also said the Egyptian president could suffer the same fate
as his predecessor, Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated by Moslem
extremists in 1981 after the 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
   Syria and Libya are the only two of 17 Arab countries that have
failed to restore ties with Egypt after breaking them over the
treaty.

<HEAD>Legislators Permit Ownership of Equipment, Inheritance of Leased
Land</HEAD>

   Legislators gave overwhelming preliminary approval
Tuesday to a bill that would scrap decades of Communist orthodoxy
by allowing people to own factories and farmers to pass leased land
on to their children.
   The landmark legislation stopped short of permitting widespread
private property, which some members advocated, and said all land
still would belong to the state.
   By a vote of 309-29, with 34 abstentions, the Supreme Soviet
approved the bill and sent it to a commission headed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which will edit the legislation and publish
it for nationwide discussion before final action.
   Strict ideologists say Marxist principle stipulates that all
means of production belong to society as a whole, and that private
ownership leads to exploitation.
   Under the legislation approved Tuesday, citizens may own their
``means of production'' and ``pursue individual and other kinds of
economic activity,'' the official news agency Tass reported.
   It did not define means of production, but the term generally
means equipment and factories.
   Farm families would have the right to pass land leased from the
state to future generations, and the legislation would permit
joint-stock and other forms of private ownership, Tass reorted.
   Allowing farmers to pass leased land along was suggested by the
Communist Party Central Committee.
   Some deputies pressed for complete legalization of private
property as a means of providing incentives for employees to work
harder.
   The bill says land and natural resources will be joint property
of the nation as a whole and the individual republics involved.
   Deputies from the independence-minded Baltic republics of
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia want exclusive ownership. They say
Moscow has abused land and resources in the past and the republics
should receive the profits from their own territory.
   The Baltics have won central government approval for control
over their own economies, beginning next year.
   Some private enterprise, in the form of cooperatives, already is
allowed and the Supreme Soviet passed legislation Tuesday governing
those businesses.
   One law bars cooperatives from buying manufactured goods and
food from the state and reselling it for profit. Another imposed
price controls on cooperatives to prevent gouging.

<TEXT>
   A woman who was sentenced to 25 years in
prison after pleading guilty to killing her live-in boyfriend, who
she said beat her, has pleaded guilty a second time and been
allowed to go free.
   Susan J. Scott, 36, was a free woman Monday for the first time
since the slaying of Frederick E. Bickling, 43, in September 1986.
   Scott has always maintained that she was a battered woman and
feared Bickling would kill her.
   Kent County Superior Court Judge John E. Babiarz Jr., who
sentenced her after her first guilty plea in May 1988, this week
accepted a prosecution recommendation to resentence her to time
already served _ three years and 26 days _ and seven years
probation.
   ``I know now ... that you were abused by him to a certain
extent,'' Babiarz told Scott. ``I am not about to characterize how
much or how little. But I am satisfied you are less culpable than I
thought you were last year.''
   Scott first pleaded guilty to manslaughter a week before she was
to be tried on a charge of first-degree murder.
   Scott's family later fired her lawyer and retained Richard L.
Ducote, a New Orleans attorney who specializes in abuse cases.
   Earlier this year, Ducote asked Babiarz to allow Scott to
withdraw her guilty plea, alleging the first attorney did not give
her adequate representation and should have argued that Scott
suffered from ``battered woman syndrome'' and shot Bickling in
self-defense.
   Scott was allowed to withdraw her original plea and jury
selection was scheduled to begin Monday for a new first-degree
murder trial. At the last minute, Deputy Attorney General James
Rambo again offered a plea bargain, and Scott agreed to plead
guilty to manslaughter a second time. She also waived her $56,000
share of Bickling's life insurance policy.
   Scott issued a statement saying she should have fled the
relationship with Bickling.
   ``I admit that my recklessnness led to the death of Fred
Bickling,'' she said. ``When he began abusing me, I was reckless in
remaining in the relationship. When the pattern of abuse got worse,
I was reckless in not leaving him and seeking help for battered
women.''

<TEXT>
   A government report published Tuesday cleared
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim of allegations he was involved in
the executions of British prisoners in Greece while serving as a
German army officer in 1944.
   Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton told Parliament 16
investigators examined thousands of documents provided by the
United States, West Germany and Greece. Their 117-page report
concluded Waldheim could not be held responsible for the prisoners'
execution though he was probably aware of their fate.
   Hamilton said the lengthy investigation failed to find evidence
pointing to a war crime by Waldheim when he was a lieutenant
serving as an intelligence officer in the Balkans.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ordered the inquiry in February
1988.
   The Justice Department said in Washington that Waldheim would
still be banned from entering the United States. His name was
placed on the unwanted list in April 1987 after a finding he was
involved in the execution of Allied prisoners and the deportation
of Jews to death camps.
   Neal Sher, head of the U.S. Office of Special Investigation that
looks into Nazi war crimes, said Tuesday, ``The notion that
Waldheim has been exonerated is absurd.''
   Waldheim always denied war crimes accusations and after the
British report was delivered in Vienna, his office stated: ``The
investigation report of the British government relayed to the
British Parliament today proves once again that the allegations
against Federal President Dr. Kurt Waldheim in connection with his
wartime service are devoid of any foundation in this case, too, as
has been the case with previous accusations.''
   In an interview later on Austrian television, Waldheim said:
``The report fills me, of course, with great satisfaction.''
   Six British commandos were captured in April 1944, two years
after Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler ordered that all captured
commandos be killed after interrogation.
   The commandos of the Special Boat Squadron were taken to
Arsakli, 10 miles east of Salonika, for interrogation at the
headquarters of German Army Group E, where Waldheim was a junior
intelligence officer.
   The prisoners refused to talk and were later shot by firing
squad in a suburb of Athens, a war crime under the Geneva
Convention, which forbids killing prisoners of war.
   ``No evidence has come to light to indicate that as a junior
staff officer he (Waldheim) had the power either to order or to
prevent that fate or indeed to affect the outcome in any way,''
Hamilton said.
   The report dismisses allegations that records were altered,
destroyed or withheld to protect Waldheim and says Waldheim was
never wanted by Britain either as a ``top Nazi'' or as a war
criminal.
   Robert Rhodes James, a British lawmaker who served in Waldheim's
U.N. office when Waldheim was secretary-general and who pressed for
the inquiry, commented: ``The conclusion is that because he was so
junior he could not be accused of being a war criminal.''
   But the allegation was that Waldheim was involved in war crimes,
and evidence of participation existed, James said.
   Sher said, ``It is absolutely impossible to conclude that
Waldheim was uninvolved in the interrogation of the commandos and
the process which led to their demise.''
   Greville Janner, secretary of the parliamentary war crimes
group, said in London: ``Waldheim was there, he knew _ that's what
the report says. He should never have been secretary-general of the
United Nations, nor president of Austria.
   ``We never suggested he was holding the smoking gun, but the
report confirms that he knew what was going on, he was part of the
team. He knew our boys were being sent away to be exterminated and
that is what the report confirms.''
   The New York-based World Jewish Congress said in a statement the
report ``finally put to rest'' Waldheim's claim that no British
commandos were interrogated at his headquarters.
   The congress charged in 1986 that for more than 40 years
Waldheim covered up his past as an officer in the German army
command that deported thousands of Greek Jews to their deaths and
murdered Yugoslav partisans and peasants.

   President Bush, in a rallying cry to GOP
governors, said Tuesday night that the key to wresting control of
Congress from the Democrats in the 1990s is to elect more
Republican governors next year.
   Bush, in remarks prepared for delivery at a Republican Governors
Association dinner, said that if the party is to escape its
minority status, ``we must rededicate ourselves to the nuts and
bolts of politics, the grassroots, as our opponents, do.''
   He bemoaned the fact that 34 years have passed since the
Republicans last controlled the House of Representatives, and said
the Democrats perpetuate their hold through gerrymandering schemes
approved by state legislatures they also control.
   ``We have proven, time and again, that our party can keep the
White House,'' said Bush. ``But to win a majority of governorships,
state offices and seats in Congress, we must roll up our sleeves
and get down to the basics of winning elections.''
   Bush outlined what he called ``three obtainable goals'' for the
1990 elections.
   The first is ``to move toward our rightful place as the majority
party of governors,'' said Bush. The Democrats now hold 28
governorships to the Republicans' 22.
   ``Our second goal is to recapture the U.S. Senate,'' he said.
The Republicans held the Senate from 1981 to 1987, but Democrats
now have the edge, 55-45.
   ``And third, we must open the House of Representatives to
two-party competition,'' the president said. ``But the key to all
three goals is the first: to elect more Republican governors.''
   He called gerrymandering _ drawing congressional district lines
in ways to boost the chances of a particular party _ ``a terrible
injustice.''
   ``As Republican leaders, you can veto these gerrymander schemes
and take our message to voters of your states by declaring that
this form of voter discrimination must end,'' said Bush, the first
president in the last four to reach the White House without first
serving as a governor.
   Virginia and New Jersey choose new governors next month.
Thirty-six governorships are at stake in 1990, including 20 now
held by Democrats. Virginia now has a Democratic governor, New
Jersey a Republican.

<HEAD>US Wants Right to Continue Producing Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency confirmed Tuesday that the United States wants
to reserve the right to continue producing chemical weapons, even
as it pursues an international pact on banning the deadly weapons.
   Ronald Lehman was asked in a meeting with reporters about recent
reports that President Bush has signed an order allowing the
continued production of a new generation of chemical weapons for an
unspecified period of time.
   The reports surfaced after Bush told the United Nations last
month that he was proposing the United States and the Soviet Union
cut their existing chemical weapons stockpiles by 80 percent as an
impetus to the Geneva negotiations at which talks on curbing
chemical weapons are underway.
   The president did not mention his decision on production in his
U.N. speech.
   Bush, as vice president in 1984, carried a draft text to the
Geneva negotiations proposing that nations signing a chemical
weapons treaty cease producing such arms right away and destroy
their stockpiles over a 10-year period. The international talks, in
which 40 nations are taking part, resume next month.
   An agreed-upon draft of the international treaty calls for the
immediate end to the production of such weapons.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, on Monday criticized Bush's
stance on continuing to produce chemical weapons, calling it ``a
major step backwards'' and one that threatens the international
negotiations.
   Asked about such criticism, Lehman said the threat of chemical
weapons ``needs to be addressed and our policy has been to seek a
total ban on the production and storage and use of these weapons.''
   But he stressed that the administration has also been ``quite
clear,'' and told Congress that it intends ``to maintain our binary
program.'' Binary chemical weapons are a new generation of chemical
arms that consist of two non-lethal substances that become deadly
when mixed.
   ``It is not good to cut programs in anticipation of negotiations
_ that undercuts your negotiation leverage, it undercuts your
security,'' Lehman said.
   The arms agency head said that the key to U.S. elimination of
its older chemical weapons is to get other nations to eliminate
theirs, ``and until they are committed to such a thing, we will
have a stock, albeit a very small stock.
   ``So we will be continuing our production program. The president
has asked us to look at how we would structure the program, how we
would implement this in the context of the overall negotiations,''
Lehman said.
   ``Our policy is clear. Whatever stocks will be maintained, they
should be the safest possible,'' he said.
   Lehman defended the administration's stance, saying it had made
progress on the issue during the recent U.S.-Soviet talks in
Wyoming, and said that as a result of that session the two
superpowers will begin exchanging data on the location and types of
stocks and amounts that the two sides have before the end of this
year.
   But Soviets diplomats, speaking privately, have said the Kremlin
is concerned about Bush's decision to continue production of the
new generation of chemical weapons.
   His U.N. proposal on having the two superpowers reduce their
stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 percent of the current U.S.
level would mean deeper cuts for the Soviets than for the United
States.
   U.S. officials contend Moscow has far greater stockpiles than
the United States _ an acknowledged 50,000 tons compared to an
estimated 30,000 tons for the United States.
   Bush proposed a U.S.-Soviet agreement to begin those cuts at
once, while the 40-nation treaty was being worked out in which the
United States would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over
eight years if the Soviets joined the ban.
   The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban.
   Only the United States, the Soviet Union and Iraq acknowledge
having chemical weapons, but more than 20 nations are believed to
have them or the capability to produce them.
   The United States has condemned Iran and Iraq for using chemical
weapons and has said Libya is on the verge of production. Some
officials suspect Syria has a chemical weapons program.

   Fire and heavy smoke engulfed a house
Tuesday, driving back neighbors, firefighters and police officers
who tried to save the five young children and two adults who died
in the blaze.
   June Scott, who escaped unharmed with a 5-year-old grandchild,
lost her father, son and five grandchildren.
   ``It's a very great, great, great tragedy,'' Mrs. Scott said.
``You don't know how I feel about losing my father and my baby boy
and five little babies that couldn't even help themselves.''
   Firefighters pulled three children from the burning three-story
row house, but they were dead when taken to The Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia, hospital spokeswoman Brenda Hicks said.
   Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer said the fire appeared to be
accidental but the cause was not immediately known.
   Ulshafer said the fire must have been burning for some time
before it was reported at 7:34 a.m., because the first floor was
fully aflame when firefighters arrived from a firehouse two blocks
away.
   ``If you look at the faces of the firemen around here, they're
stunned that in a small house like this, you lose seven people,''
he said.
   He said the house apparently had no smoke alarms, which are not
required in older, private homes. Three of the dead were found near
a window, he said.
   ``There was fire coming out of the windows, and the babies just
screaming and howling, people were all screaming and howling,''
said Cynthia Morrison, who lives in the working-class neighborhood
on the city's west side.
   Ian Baldwin, who lives across the street, said his mother called
in an alarm after he saw Mrs. Scott running.
   ``I saw her running across the street screaming, `My house is on
fire! My house is on fire!''' he said. ``I told my mom to call the
fire department.''
   Baldwin said he and a few other neighbors tried to enter the
burning house from the rear. ``There was too much smoke,'' he said.
   Several more attempts were made by firefighters and three
undercover police officers to enter the house but they were driven
back by the heavy smoke and flames, said John Devlin, a battalion
fire chief.
   The victims were identified as Mrs. Scott's father, Clyde
Staples, 66; her son, Emerson Lee, 19; and her grandchildren:
Joseph Lee, 7; 3-year-old twins Jamal and Jeffrey Lee; Andrell
McCoy, 5, and Shanta McCoy, 3.
   Emerson Lee was the uncle of the five children. The grandchild
who survived was Andrell McCoy's twin.
   Later in the day, dozens of neighbors gathered around the gray
stucco home as firefighters tossed blackened mattresses, chairs,
rubble and papers through shattered windows.
   First-floor shutters had partially melted and were dangling away
from the building. Plumes of soot stretched up all sides of the
house and onto the adjoining house, which was otherwise undamaged.

   The first airlift in East
Germany's refugee exodus flew in from Warsaw late Tuesday _ with
the 125 refugees flashing smiles, new passports and a teddy bear
before heading off for the next stop of their journey to a new life.
   The flight brought relief to only a small fraction of the latest
refugee wave, as more than 1,700 other East Germans fleeing their
reform-resistant homeland remained behind in the Polish capital
awaiting travel documents.
   In a compromise solution announced Saturday, the refugees were
allowed to renounce their citizenship at the East German Embassy in
Warsaw, freeing them to go on to the West German Embassy to receive
the necessary travel documents.
   ``Now, for the first time, we can look forward to freedom,''
declared 27-year-old Gabriele Holger after descending with her son
and husband from the Soviet-made Tupolev-154 aircraft.
   The Bonn government chartered the aircraft from Poland's LOT
airline.
   Twelve-year-old Michaela Ostmann clutched her teddy bear ``Sonny
Heart'' as her parents and fellow passengers were hustled onto
buses waiting on the tarmac for the refugees who touched down in
this northern industrial city just after 8:30 p.m.
   The refugees, the latest of more than 53,000 to arrive in West
Germany since last month, were the first to fly to freedom. East
Germany agreed to the arrangement apparently to avoid the
near-riots that marred two previous evacuations from Warsaw and
Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   During a dramatic release of thousands on Oct. 5, East German
police used force to prevent other desperate would-be escapees from
jumping aboard the westbound trains as they passed through East
Germany.
   A couple of dozen relatives, friends and well-wishers were left
stranded inside Duesseldorf airport terminal when authorities
prevented them from going onto the tarmac. The new arrivals were
being quickly directed onto buses for the trip to a reception
center at Schoeppingen, about 40 minutes to the north.
   ``We are a little disappointed,'' said Anika Roescher of
Duesseldorf, one of those unable to greet the arrivals. ``We wanted
to see if our friends were in this group.''
   A distraught woman at the airport information office shouted
over the public address system to the thwarted greeting-party, ``We
have no possibility to let you get in contact with the arriving
refugees! We understand very well that you are angry, frustrated
and disappointed'' at not being able to talk to them, the voice
said.
   During arrivals of East Germans from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
Poland in recent weeks, the public was generally allowed to greet
the newcomers. Authorities at Duesseldorf airport explained,
however, they wanted to get the new arrivals to Schoeppingen
quickly.
   One angry young West German, who declined to give his name, told
reporters he was waiting for his uncle, ``and now I'll have to
return home without knowing if he has arrived.''
   In the Polish capital, refugee children at the airport held up a
banner before their departure, reading, ``Thank you, Warsaw. Auf
Wiedersehen.''
   ``Things can't go wrong now. We just hope we make it safely and
don't crash,'' said a young construction worker from East Berlin as
he stood in line with other refugees there to check in for the
flight.
   The plane took off on schedule for the two-hour journey.
   West German Ambassador Franz-Joachim Schoeller boarded the plane
in Warsaw shortly before takeoff to bid farewell to the refugees,
and he said the number of East Germans remaining there has swelled
to 1,667.
   East Germans have been arriving at the embassy for weeks.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans have fled East Germany
recently, most of them skilled young workers who complain of
repression by Erich Honecker's strict regime.
   Hans Klein, chief West German spokesman, said in Bonn his
government had asked the East Germans to process papers for the
refugees in Warsaw in groups larger than the 40-50 originally
planned. He said the East Germans had not responded.
   The flood of German refugees began after Hungary removed all
restrictions on its border with Austria on Sept. 10. An additional
70,000 emigrated by legal means or did not return from visits to
West Germany.
   Honecker's government requires the refugees in Warsaw to give up
their citizenship in exchange for new identity cards, which allow
them to leave for the West choice but prohibit them from traveling
through East Germany.

   Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union and Jan Timman
of the Netherlands on Tuesday scored last-round semifinal victories
in the World Chess Championship Candidates.
   The winner of the Candidates' final, scheduled for March in
London, will challenge world champion Garri Kasparov for his title
in a 24-game match starting October 1990.
   Karpov, 38, who held the world title for 10 years before losing
to Kasparov in 1985, returned to form and scored a crushing 53-move
victory over fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in the eighth and final
game.
   Timman, 37, defeated Jon Speelman of England in 54 moves after a
zigzag battle.
   Both Karpov and Timman won by 4.5 points to 3.5. A win scores
one point and a draw one half-point.
   Karpov, playing white, built up a devastating kingside attack
and then exchanged down to reach an endgame with two extra pawns.
   Karpov and Timman each get $77,000 for winning their semifinals,
while Yusupov and Speelman each won $46,000.

<HEAD>Red Cross Asks Release Of Two of Its Workers in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red
Cross on Tuesday demanded release of two Swiss medical workers held
hostage in Lebanon.
   ``The ICRC calls for the immediate and unconditional release of
its delegates,'' it said in a French-language statement released in
Beirut.
   It called the Oct. 6 abduction of Red Cross orthopedic
technicians Emmanuel Christen, 32, and Elio Erriquez, 23, an
``unacceptable and unjustifiable attempt against the 15 years of
humanitarian work of the ICRC in Lebanon.''
   Masked gunmen kidnapped the pair, bundled them into the trunk of
a car and sped off toward Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp on
the outskirts of Sidon.
   Tuesday's statement said a Western news agency in Ankara,
Turkey, received a telephone call from a man purporting to speak
for the Lebanese Islamic Jihad, or holy war, and claiming
responsibility. He said the lives of the two would be in danger if
air pirate Mohammed Hussein Hariri was not released in three days.
   Islamic Jihad usually communicates through written statements,
accompanied by a photograph of a hostage to demonstrate
authenticity. Such was not the case with the Ankara call.
   Hariri, 22, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is serving a life sentence
in Switzerland for hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner to Geneva in
1987 and killing a French passenger on board.
   The Red Cross closed its orthopedic center in Sidon, which
provides artificial limbs to civil war victims, after the
abductions.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's letter to
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., outlining his opposition to a bill
that would extend Medicaid benefits to pay for abortions for
victims of rape or incest. Byrd is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill.
   Dear Bob,
   As the Senate begins consideration of H.R. 2990, the conference
report accompanying the Department of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and Related Appropriations bill for
(fiscal year) 1990, I want you to know that I will not sign the
measure should it include language that expands federal funding for
abortion beyond that which has been current law sine 1981.
   My position on the issue of abortion is clear. I support a
constitutional amendment that would reverse the Supreme Court's
decision in Roe v. Wade. I also support a human life amendment with
an exception for rape, incest, or where the life of the mother is
threatened. I do not support federal funding of abortions except
where the mother's life is threatened.
   As H.R. 2990 progressed through the legislative process, my
senior advisors indicated that they would recommend I veto the
measure if it included expanded federal funding for abortion beyond
the life of the mother exception. Although I wrote a letter to
members of Congress clearly expressing my concerns during
consideration of the District of Columbia Appropriations bill for
FY 1990, I nonetheless asked my senior advisors to take another
look at this complex issue, particularly the role of public funds,
consistent, though, with my position as stated above.
   This decision is one that I have not reached easily or lightly.
   Many citizens and members of Congress were consulted as this
question was reviewed. Abortion is a difficult, often painful, and
very personal decision for all Americans. It is made even more
difficult when the underlying issue is whether the government _ and
ultimately the American taxpayer _ is asked to pay for abortions
and under what circumstances. Since 1981, the federal government
has detemined, I think wisely, that taxpayer funds should be used
for abortion in only the most narrow of circumstances: where the
life of the mother is endangered. If abortion funding were expanded
to include other circumstances, it would be difficult to limit to
the few cases of actual rape or incest, and could have the
unintended consequence of allowing the taking of countless other
lives of unborn children well beyond the few cases argued as
reasons for the proposed legislative change.
   My intense personal concern for those women who are victims of
the crimes of rape and incest is as strongly felt as my position on
abortion. Rape and incest are crimes of violence which must not go
unpunished, and those convicted of such crimes must be brought to
justice.
   The question raised by H.R. 2990, however, involves whether the
federal government and American taxpayers should be forced to pay
for the termination of an unborn child's life in the case of rape
or incest. That such a child may have been conceived through an
unconscionable act of violence makes this question difficult and,
indeed, agonizing; it does not, however, alter the basic fact that
Federal funding is being sought that would compound a violent act
with the taking of an unborn life. And in the absence of perfect
legislation that would reconcile these difficult issues, if I have
to err, I prefer to err on the side of human life.
   For these reasons, should H.R. 2990 reach my desk with language
expanding federal funding of abortion, I will veto the measure and
return it to Congress.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday that
Israel stood ready to confront the United States rather than trade
occupied land for peace.
   ``We are not interested in conflicts,'' Shamir said, in some of
his harshest words for the Bush administration. ``But the United
States should know that there are things Israel will stand on to
the end.''
   Shamir told supporters of his right-wing Likud bloc at a rally
in Ramle: ``In everything related to the Land of Israel, we shall
stand as one man, and we will not give in, even if we would have to
face a conflict. I hope we would not have to. It is not justified
from the American point of view, but totally justified from the
Jewish and the Israeli points of view.''
   Shamir rejected American efforts to arrange negotiations between
Israeli and Palestinian delegations in Cairo. President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt has offered to play host to such talks.
   ``The stone-throwers, the firebombers have not succeeded in
driving us into the arms of the PLO. It is not possible that when
they fail to do this, others by diplomatic means and exercises
would try to bring us to meetings with the PLO,'' Shamir said.
   He said the proposed meeting would be a ``trap'' in which other
parties would try to make Israel ``slide into recognition of a
Palestinian state.''
   Israel has balked at the proposed meeting with Palestinian
representatives because it fears the Palestinians would be members
of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel considers the PLO
a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it.
   Shamir told a closed-door meeting of Likud legislators earlier
Tuesday that Israel might be ``entering a period of tension with
the United States,'' Israel radio reported.
   On Tuesday, a human rights group reported that Israeli soldiers
killed 20 Palestinians in the first two weeks of October, one of
the bloodiest periods of the 22-month-old uprising against Israeli
rule in the occupied lands.
   The increase in deaths followed a change in army orders last
month that allows soldiers to fire live ammunition at masked
Palestinians who ignore orders to halt, even if they are not armed.
   Army reports said at least eight Palestinians killed in the
first 15 days of October wore masks.
   According to the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights,
the early October death toll was second only to the same period in
April 1988, when 23 Palestinians were killed.
   Soldiers or Israeli civilians have killed 596 Palestinians since
the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and 40 Israelis have died. At least 130 Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating
with Israel.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured three West Bank towns
Tuesday, including Beit Sahour, where soldiers and tax agents have
carried out tax raids for three weeks.
   Reporters and photographers were not allowed to accompany Rabin
into the Christian town, which the army has declared a ``closed
military zone.''
   Telephone lines also have been cut to Beit Sahour, a town of
about 10,000 known for widespread compliance with a tax boycott
called by the uprising leadership.
   Israeli officials said up to $1 million worth of furniture,
machinery and other goods had been confiscated in Beit Sahour and
would be sold to recover unpaid taxes. The town is prosperous
because scores of small, family-owned factories operate there.
   ``Everyone, everywhere, pays taxes,'' Rabin said after touring
Beit Sahour.
   In nearby Bethlehem, a soldier pursuing Palestinian
stone-throwers was slightly injured by a rock and troopers opened
fire, wounding one Palestinian, the army said. A second man was
reported arrested.
   Elsewhere, seven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in
clashes with Israeli troops, Arab hospital officials reported. The
army said it was checking the reports.

<HEAD>Defense Lawyer: Molestation Investigators Fanned Rumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators inadvertently touched rumors at
the outset of the McMartin preschool molestation case, creating
community hysteria that tainted the probe, a defense attorney said
Tuesday in the 2{-year-long trial.
   Attorney Dean Gits outlined a range of doubts about police
competence and witnesses' credibility, appealing to a jury during
his closing statement to depend on common sense and the legal
standard of reasonable doubt.
   ``I want you to take them and put them in your pocket and carry
them with you,'' Gits said.
   Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62,
are charged with 64 counts of molestation and a joint count of
conspiracy. They are accused of molesting 11 children at the
family-owned McMartin Pre-School in suburban Manhattan Beach.
   The alleged crimes date back a decade and the trial _ at 2{
years _ is the longest criminal proceeding in the nation. Judge
William Pounders has said jury deliberations in Superior Court
could be very lengthy.
   Gits argued that police incompetence at the start of an
investigation of a parent's complaint touched off rumors in
Manhattan Beach.
   He cited a Sept. 8, 1983, form letter that investigators sent to
hundreds of parents whose children had attended the preschool.
   The letter asked parents to keep the investigation confidential
because of ``the highly emotional effect it could have on our
community.''
   ``Law enforcement completely lost control of the interview
process. It was the start of rumors that governed this case,'' Gits
said.
   He said medical procedures used to determine whether children
were molested were unscientific, and that too many people testified
they never saw sexual abuse for the allegations to make sense.
   Gits focused on conflicting information in the testimony of one
alleged victim, a boy who said games like ``naked movie star,''
``tickle'' and ``cowboys and Indians'' took place in a secret room.
   The boy attended the school from fall 1978 to June 1979.
   He testified at a preliminary hearing that teacher Babette
Spitler was in a room at the time of a ``naked movie star'' game
and molested him, Gits said. He said the boy didn't claim that
during the trial and that Ms. Spitler didn't work at the school
when he was there.
   Ms. Spitler was among seven McMartin teachers originally
arrested in 1983. Charges against her and four others were dropped
for lack of evidence, and the case was scaled down from hundreds of
counts involving 41 children.
   The judge has limited each side to 6{ days for closing
arguments, fearing a mistrial if the case drags on.
   Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson concluded his summation on
Monday after three days, reserving 3{ days for rebuttal of defense
arguments.

   Georgia asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to
allow implementation of a law opposed by abortion rights advocates
that would require young women to inform their parents before
having abortions.
   An attorney representing two Planned Parenthood chapters in
Georgia urged the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold
lower court decisions which have blocked the law for two years.
   The law would require a woman under 18 to bring a note from a
parent before having an abortion, or otherwise show a parent was
notified. A minor could secure the permission of a juvenile court
judge to undergo an abortion without parental knowledge.
   The statute also includes a 24-hour waiting period between the
time of notification and the abortion.
   The appeals court took the case under consideration without
indicating when it would rule.
   The statute was first passed in 1987, but a lawsuit filed by
Planned Parenthood resulted in a federal judge ruling key portions
unconstitutional before it took effect. The Legislature revised the
statute in 1988, but it was again challenged by Planned Parenthood
with the same result.
   In the second lower-court ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert
Hall ruled, among other things, that the law improperly allowed a
juvenile court ``intake officer'' to screen and possibly dismiss a
young woman's request for a waiver.
   Kathryn Allen, a senior assistant state attorney general,
complained to the the appeals court Tuesday that Hall applied too
strict a standard.
   ``The court below has taken what is constitutionally permissible
and put it under a microscope, finding constitutional defects in
the most unlikely places,'' Ms. Allen said.
   Dara Klassel, a Planned Parenthood lawyer, disagreed.
   Laws affecting ``a fundamental constitutional right have to be
subjected to strict scrutiny,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   An Afghan convoy is en route to the
eastern border town of Khost, where planes have been parachuting
supplies to communist troops besieged by U.S.-backed rebels,
Western diplomats said Tuesday.
   They said that elsewhere, rebels have blockaded the 75-mile
highway linking Kabul, the capital, to the eastern city of
Jalalabad and that the government has launched heavy air attacks
and armored assaults trying to open the road.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said guerrilla
forces have moved within three miles of Khost airport. The town
lies about 10 miles from the border with Pakistan. Guerrilla groups
long have used Pakistan as a base.
   The rebels have been trying for weeks to take the heavily
fortified town. The capture of Khost would allow them to open
direct supply lines to bases in central and northern Afghanistan.
   Diplomatic sources, presumably with access to satellite
pictures, said photographs show parachutes inside the Khost
perimeter. ``There is clear visible evidence of air drops'' by
government forces, one diplomat said.
   Rebel sources said planes parachuted 44 barrels of fuel about
two weeks ago, but eight reached the target and the rest landed in
guerrilla-controlled areas.
   The last attempt to resupply Khost by land was in December 1987,
when 20,000 Soviet soldiers reportedly helped out. The attempt
succeeded after six weeks.
   Diplomats said a 200-vehicle convoy left Kabul late last week
and was moving slowly toward Gardez, about 45 miles northwest of
Khost.
   Moscow sent more than 103,000 soldiers into Afghanistan in 1979
to back up the Marxist government. But the last Soviet soldiers
left last Feb. 15 in keeping with a U.N.-brokered accord.
   However, the Soviet Union has airlifted millions of dollars in
military aid to the government in Kabul since then, diplomatic
sources say.
   Washington is a major backer of the Afghan rebels, who have been
fighting for more than a decade to oust successive communist
governments.

   East Germany's ruling Politburo held a meeting
Tuesday that could determine the fate of Erich Honecker, the
77-year-old leader whose stern rule has been challenged by mass
emigration and pro-democracy protest.
   Demonstrations were reported in five cities on the eve of the
regular weekly meeting, including a march by 120,000 people in
Leipzig that was the largest protest since East Germany was founded
40 years ago.
   In West Germany, the mass-circulation newspaper Bild reported
late Tuesday that a special session of the Communist Party Central
Committee had been called for Wednesday.
   Quoting party sources it did not identify, Bild said Honecker
would be ``pressured'' to turn over leadership of the party ``to
younger hands.'' Honecker also is East Germany's head of state.
   Secrecy surrounded the Politburo meeting. Early Wednesday, there
was no report of any action taken at the session.
   The flight of tens of thousands of East Germans and protests
that began early this month have been the most visible signs of
growing opposition to Honecker, who has presided over an
authoritarian regime for 18 years.
   Pro-democracy activists estimated the Monday night throng in
Leipzig at more than 120,000, but West Germany's ZDF television
network quoted witnesses Tuesday as saying the number of marchers
was closer to 150,000.
   Chants of ``Freedom!'' and ``Democracy now!'' rose from the
throng and marchers shouted ``We're staying here!'' Most protesters
in East Germany have been people who do not want to emigrate and
demand reform at home akin to those being pursued in the Soviet
Union, Hungary and Poland.
   ARD television of West Germany said thousands also marched
Monday night in Magdeburg, Plauen and Halle.
   About 3,000 pro-democracy activists held a vigil in an East
Berlin church Monday night. Security on the capital's streets was
increased, but no incidents were reported.
   Three men were given prison terms for vandalism, illegal
assembly and resisting arrest Oct. 4-5, when thousands of people
tried to board trains at Dresden that carried East German refugees
to West Germany from Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   Two got more than three years and the third received 4{ years,
said the official news agency ADN, which reported the convictions
and sentences Tuesday.
   Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden told 10,000 protesters from
a City Hall balcony Monday night, speaking through a megaphone,
that he was prepared to continue dialogue with reform-minded groups.
   He refused, however, to talk with the pro-democracy New Forum, a
new organization that has united the East German reform movement.
   At last week's regular meeting, the 21-member Politburo
expressed willingness to talk about possible reform.
   That increased interest in this Tuesday's session, which many
people felt might indicate the political futures of Honecker and
his aging colleagues.
   Power rests in the hands of the Politburo, which is dominated by
hardliners, but leadership changes need formal approval by the
Central Committee, which has 163 members.
   There have been reports and speculation for days that Honecker,
who rejected talks with pro-democracy groups, might be near the end
of his tenure. Bild reported Monday that regional party leaders
were demanding his dismissal.
   The No. 2 official in East Germany's Higher Education Ministry
was quoted by Bild as saying, ``In life anything is possible'' when
asked about a Honecker resignation.
   The official, Joachim Garscha, also told Bild that government
officials realize East Germany's strict regulation of travel to the
West is among the chief complaints of many citizens. Garscha said
freer travel regulations could come ``very soon.''
   Bild's interview with Garscha was to appear in Wednesday
editions, but it was telexed to other news media in advance.
   Official media have carried scores of letters and commentaries
critical of the regime.
   In recent days, thousands of prominent East German artists,
intellectuals and entertainers have spoken out for change.
   Reform groups also have urged the government to declare a
general amnesty for those arrested and convicted of crimes in
connection with street protests, which police had broken up with
clubs until last week.
   East Germany's chief prosecutor, in an interview with state
television Tuesday, promised to investigate charges of police
brutality against protesters.
   Prosecutor Guenter Wendlandt said ``complaints by citizens will
be investigated and decisions will be made according to the
corresponding laws.''
   The Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland said Tuesday
``everything should be discussed openly,'' but it added that
changing the system's structure would not be discussed.

   A major earthquake rocked northern

miles away.
   Some buildings may have collapsed, said Police Officer D.
Collins. There were reports of injuries at Candlestick, where fans
were waiting for the World Series to begin, and the stadium was
evacuated, ABC-TV and Cable News Network reported.
   The quake, which lasted about 15 seconds, measured 6.5 on the
Richter scale, according to seismologists at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The preliminary reading was
from the Alaska Tsunami warning system, Caltech said.
   Televised footage of the bridge showed that a 30-foot section of
the span's upper deck had collapsed onto the bottom level.
   Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed for about 15
seconds. Players from the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland
Athletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leave
their seats.
   Buildings in San Francisco swayed several feet.
   The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to the
northeast, and was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the
east.
   The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at
The Associated Press' bureau in San Francisco.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Britain paved the way Tuesday for the probable
release of at least three people imprisoned 14 years ago for IRA
bombings aimed at British soldiers. The Irish government and civil
libertarians cheered the move.
   The government said it will not oppose the appeal by the
so-called ``Guildford Four'' _ three men and a woman who insisted
throughout that they were innocent and who became the focus of a
lengthy campaign for their release.
   The Times of London newspaper said policemen involved in the
original investigation that led to the convictions and life terms
will be prosecuted.
   In its Wednesday issue, copies of which were available Tuesday
night, the paper reported: ``A handful of officers, who were then
of relatively junior rank, will face charges after an investigation
by ... police into a number of aspects of the original inquiry.''
   A spokesman at the Home Office, the government department
responsible for police, refused to comment.
   The bombings led to murder convictions for the Guildford Four
during a wave of terrorism by the Irish Republican Army.
   The Dublin government, leaders of the Roman Catholic and
Anglican churches, and prominent British government figures
protested the innocence of the four.
   British Broadcasting Corp. Television, the domestic news agency
Press Association and other news reports said at least three of the
prisoners probably would be released soon after a Court of Appeal
hearing Thursday.
   ``Circumstances have recently come to the notice of the Director
of Public Prosecutions which have caused him to conclude that it
would be wrong for the Crown to seek to sustain the convictions,''
the prosecutor's office said.
   It said its decision will be explained at the Thursday hearing.
   The murder convictions of Paul Hill, Gerard Conlon and Patrick
Armstrong, all of Belfast, Northern Ireland, and of Armstrong's
English girlfriend, Carole Richardson, were referred to the Court
of Appeal by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd in January.
   The four were convicted of murder in the bombing of two pubs
frequented by British soldiers in Guildford, southwest of London,
on Oct. 5, 1974. Five people were killed, including two soldiers,
and 65 injured.
   Armstrong and Hill also were convicted of a Nov. 6, 1974, pub
bombing in Woolwich, a London suburb, in which two people died and
26 people were injured. Hill is serving a concurrent sentence for
the murder of a former British soldier in Belfast in 1975, and so
may not be released with the others, news reports said. That
conviction was based on statements obtained by Belfast police while
he was in prison in Guildford.
   IRA guerrillas are fighting to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the British province with the Republic of Ireland.
   In ordering the case reviewed, Hurd cited possible alibi
witnesses for two of the convicts, and evidence that Ms. Richardson
had been injected with drugs during interrogation because she was
suffering from withdrawal from barbiturates.
   All four were convicted on the basis of incriminating statements
which they repudiated when they came to trial. The prosecution did
not offer any forensic evidence or identifications by witnesses to
the bombings.
   Four members of an IRA unit _ the ``Balcombe Street Four'' _
admitted the two Guildford pub bombings after their arrest in
December 1975, but they were never charged in the case.
   The IRA men's statements about the bombing were presented to the
Court of Appeal in 1977, but the government attorney argued those
statements did not necessarily preclude the participation of the
four convicted earlier.
   In Dublin, the Irish government welcomed the decision ``in the
most positive terms.''
   ``The government shares what it knows will be a general feeling
today of great relief and satisfaction at this outcome,'' the Irish
statement said.
   Cardinal Basil Hume, head of the Roman Catholic Church in
Britain, told BBC-TV he was ``immensely grateful'' for the decision.
   ``I absolutely can't believe it,'' Hill's mother, Lilly Hill,
told BBC radio from Belfast. ``Good God, I just can't believe that
this has happened.''
   Lord Scarman, who was active in the campaign, said the decision
represented ``more than a pardon. These people will now be
innocent.''
   ``I think the British legal system will benefit in reputation,''
sid Scarman, 78, who as a law lord formerly was part of Britain's
highest appeals court.

   The killing of an army colonel's
daughter could jeopardize talks between Salvadoran guerrillas and
the government over ways to end their country's 10-year-old civil
war, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``It is a disastrous terrorist plan to assassinate public
officials and their families,'' said Mauricio Sandoval, a spokesman
for the government delegation, following the shooting in San
Salvador on Tuesday.
   Men firing automatic weapons killed Ana Isabel Casanova, a
student who was celebrating her 23rd birthday, in her car a block
from her home.
   In San Salvador, the government blamed insurgents for the
attack, but the language in the claim of responsibility was unlike
that used by the rebels in the past.
   A man purporting to speak for the ``joint command'' of urban
guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front called
at least one radio station in El Salvador to claim responsibility
for the attack.
   The caller said the attack was meant to underline demands for
the release of a missing unionist allegedly arrested by security
forces and to call for an end to repression by government security
forces.
   However, rebel leaders in El Salvador said in statement, ``It is
totally false that urban commandos from the FMLN killed Miss Isabel
Casanova, and we reiterate it is not FMLN policy to attempt against
the lives of relatives of military chiefs.''
   The rebel leaders said the slaying was part of ``psychological
warfare'' that the Salvadoran military high command's intelligence
division and the press office is waging against them.
   ``It is highly suspicious that this occurs just when this
meeting is taking place and the intention to speedily blame the
FMLN for the attack,'' the rebel leaders said in the statement,
which was also handed out in San Jose.
   ``Anyone can pick up the telephone and say he's from the FMLN,''
rebel spokeswoman Nidia Diaz told reporters as she distributed the
statement.
   There has been little progress reported in the two days of talks
between the rebels and the rightist government of President Alfredo
Cristiani. The government has proposed a cease-fire without the
economic, political and legal reforms the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front guerrillas insist on.
   Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador and a
witness at the talks, said the negotiating process ``allows hope,
not for spectacular results, but for them, at the end, to reach a
minimal agreement that allows work to continue so that a peace
agreement finally is signed.''
   Rebels said the assassination of the colonel's daughter, like
the removal of rebel sympathizers during a peace vigil at the
Metropolitan Cathedral in San Salvador, would not interrupt the
talks.
   The Costa Rica talks are the second meeting between the
government and rebels since the opening session occurred in Mexico
City in September.
   A previous round of dialogue between the government and rebels,
in October 1987, was broken off because of the assassination of
Herbert Anaya, leader of a leftist human rights group.
   The Front said Tuesday it proposed purging the armed forces of
its top officers, including Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Larios;
Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, the air force chief; and Col. Rene
Ponce, chief of the joint chiefs of staff'
   ``The majority of those officers have accumulated large economic
interests through corruption,'' the rebel proposal says. ``They are
involved or directly linked to acts of repression and crime.''
   Rosa Chavez, who with Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas has
mediated contact between the guerrillas and government for several
years, said the two sides were trying Tuesday to agree on what
constitutes a cease-fire in the war, which has killed an estimated
70,000 people, most of them civilians.

   A violent earthquake rocked Northern
California during Tuesday evening's rush hour, caving in a section
of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, terrifying World Series fans in
Candlestick Park and shaking buildings as far as 200 miles away.
   CBS-TV reported one person had been killed on the bridge. There
were no other immediate confirmed reports of deaths or injuries,
but ABC-TV and CNN both said some people were injured at
Candlestick, where the game was canceled and fans were evacuated.
   It was not immediately clear how extensive the damage was from
the quake, which struck at 5:04 p.m. PDT and registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale. It was centered near Hollister, 80 miles southeast
of San Francisco in San Benito County.
   ``The thing struck just as everyone was going home,'' said Tom
Mullins, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency
Services in Sacramento. ``We've got reports coming in from San
Benito and Santa Clara counties of heavy damage.''
   CBS said the California Highway Patrol reported a J.C. Penney
building in downtown Hollister collapsed and a bridge on Highway
101 in Hollister collapsed.
   There were unconfirmed reports that a shopping mall collapsed in
San Jose, 50 miles south of San Francisco.
   San Francisco Airport was evacuated, and some people there were
hit with falling plaster.
   One major fire was blazing in San Francisco's Marina District
and another near the library at University of California at
Berkeley. A huge plume of smoke visible for miles over Berkeley.
   Hundreds of people fled Bay Area Rapid Transit subway and
elevated stations in San Francisco and East Bay suburbs. The system
was shut down.
   Televised footage of the bridge connecting Oakland and San
Francisco showed that a 30-foot section of the upper deck had
collapsed, leaving two cars dangling between the two levels.
Reports said most occupants got out of their cars safely.
   In Washington, President Bush said the federal government was
prepared to send help to the earthquake area in California and he
was sending Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner there to assess
the damage.
   At City Hall in San Francisco a radio reporter told listeners,
``The entire building started to shake ... you could hear people
yelling and screaming all over the building.''
   She said there were ``obvious problems'' at the health
department across the street. ``Water was literally gushing out of
the building from a window on the second floor,'' the unidentified
reporter said.
   Citizens of Marin, north of San Francisco, were warned to shut
off their gas because the smell of gas was all over town.
   Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said
the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It occurred at
5:04 p.m. PDT and was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75
miles south of San Francico on the Pacific Coast.
   The quake was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the
northeast.
   The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at
The Associated Press bureau in San Francisco.
   The San Mateo bridge, which crosses the bay about 10 miles south
of Candlestick Park was closed for inspection.
   San Francisco Police Officer Dwayne Collins said there were
reports that buildings and statues in the historic South of Market
district near downtown had collapsed.
   ``I thought I was losing my balance, then I saw the lamppost
sway one foot each direction. Then I saw falling glass, broken
glass on the street, but luckily not near me, `` said Les Galvacs
who was walking down Market Street in downtown San Francisco.
   David Balague, 22, was on the 14th floor of the Bank of America
building. ``I've never been so scared. People were fighting to get
under the desks.''
   Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed shortly
before the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics were to have
begun the third game of the World Series.
   ``This upper deck was absolutely shaking, the light stanchions
were blowing back and forth, phones have gone out,'' Suzyn Waldman,
a reporter covering the World Series for WFAN-AM in New York told
listeners shortly after the quake hit. ``Everyone is standing
around here, people in the upper deck absolutely terrified to move
not knowing what to do.''
   A man in Saratoga, southwest of San Jose, told a San Francisco
radio station, ``My house is OK, but everything in it is gone. My
refrigerator is standing in the middle of the kitchen.'' He said
10,000 gallons of water from his swimming pool crashed through his
picture window into his home.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 6 on the scale can cause severe damage. A 7
reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before
the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the
Richter scale.

   An assassin apparently sent by drug
barons stepped from a motorcycle Tuesday and calmly killed a
federal judge with six gunshots as he waited outside his home in
Medellin for a ride to work, witnesses said.
   Hours later, a radio announcer was shot to death by unidentified
assailants in Medellin, hub of the major Colombian drug cartel,
making him the eighth newsman assassinated since the government
cracked down on narcotics traffickers on Aug. 19.
   The radio network Caracol quoted police as saying two men on a
motorcycle gunned down Diego Vargas Escobar of the Medellin station
La Voz de las Americas while the 54-year-old was in his car in a
western section of the city. The victim had worked for Caracol
until changing jobs several months ago.
   Police said there had no suspects in the shootings.
   Earlier, an anonymous telephone caller to Caracol radio in
Medellin said ``the Extraditables'' killed Judge Hector Jimenez
Rodriguez in retaliation for the extradition of Colombians wanted
on drug charges in the United States.
   Jimenez, 55, is among scores of judges and court employees slain
by the drug gangs. After his murder, the 14,000 members of a court
workers' union, which includes federal judges, called a three-day
strike that virtually shut down the judicial system.
   Union spokeswoman Consuelo Hererra said about 3,000 of the
estimated 9,000 non-union court employees had decided to join the
strike.
   A union executive in Bogota said none of Medellin's 42 federal
judges had police protection. He spoke anonymously to avoid
becoming a target of drug dealers.
   ``The Extraditables'' refers to alleged traffickers wanted in
the United States. Colombia has extradited four suspects since a
government crackdown on drug gangs began.
   A newspaper bombed Monday brought out a slim edition Tuesday
despite destruction of about 80 percent of its facilities at
Bucaramanga in northeastern Colombia. Vanguardia Liberal published
16 pages instead of its usual 24.
   An official police report Tuesday said the car bomb killed four
people and wounded nine. Some broadcast and newspaper reports had
said as many as six were killed and 20 injured.
   Jimenez spent 20 years as a judge in the federal appeals court
at Medellin, 150 miles northwest of Bogota. All federal judges in
the city have handled drug matters, but it was not known
immediately whether Jimenez had recent cases involving the Medellin
cartel.
   On Tuesday, the judge waited in his house and a colleague, Jaime
Ardila Urrea, called for him. As he prepared to step into Ardila's
car shortly before 7 a.m., two men pulled up on a motorcycle,
witnesses told Caracol.
   The motorcycle's passenger got off, strolled over to Jimenez,
pulled a revolver and fired six shots, the witnesses said.
   Police said Ardila was not injured and the assailants sped away
on the motorcycle.
   Various figures are given on the number of judges slain in
Colombia. The union says 221 court employees, including 42 judges,
have been killed in 12 years, many of them by drug traffickers.
   The United States has sent Colombia bulletproof vests for judges
and approved a program to train judges to use firearms and take
other defensive actions. A colleague said Jimenez was not wearing a
bulletproof vets.
   Court workers struck for a week after drug traffickers killed
federal Judge Carlos Valencia Garcia in Bogota on Aug. 16. He was
murdered days after rejecting a defense request to exonerate Pablo
Escobar, reputed chief of the Medellin cartel, of planning the
assassination of a newspaper publisher.
   Escobar had been charged in the 1987 killing of Guillermo Cano,
publisher of El Espectador. He is among 12 top alleged traffickers
wanted in the United States, none of whom have been captured.
   The four suspects extradited so far are said to be underlings in
the multibillion-dollar cocaine trade.

   Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union and Jan Timman
of the Netherlands scored decisive last-round victories Tuesday
against their opponents in the World Chess Championship Candidates'
semifinal.
   They will face off in the Candidates' final, set for March in
London, with the winner challenging world champion Garri Kasparov
of the Soviet Union for his title in a 24-game match starting
October 1990.
   Karpov and Timman each won by 4.5 points to 3.5. A win scores
one point and a draw half a point.
   Karpov, 38, who held the world title for 10 years until losing
to Kasparov in 1985, scored a crushing semifinal last-round victory
over fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in 53 moves.
   Timman, 37, defeated Jon Speelman of England in 54 moves after a
zigzag battle.
   After leaving the stage at the Sadler's Wells ballet theater,
Karpov told a news conference the quality of play in his match
against Yusupov and in Timman's match against Speelman was poor.
   Asked to comment on Kasparov's claim that the world champion
wouldn't face a difficult challenge in 1990, Karpov replied: ``If
we play on the same level as here, he has no rival. But I don't
think we shall play this level of chess all the time.''
   Timman told a later news conference he felt psychologically
stronger after the match.
   Asked about his chances of beating Karpov, Timman said: ``I
never say before the match what I think my chances are.''
   Karpov and Timman will each receive $77,000 for their play in
the semifinal. Yusupov and Speelman will each receive $46,200.
   A German computer company has offered a prize of 1 million Swiss
francs ($616,000) to the first Westerner to win the Candidates'
final and challenge Kasparov.
   Playing with the advantage of white, Karpov returned to form
after a lackluster showing in the first seven games.
   Kasparov said by telephone from Los Angeles that Karpov deserved
to lose his match against Yusupov.
   He cited a winning continuation missed by Yusupov in the sixth
game, which could have catapulted Yusupov into the lead.
   On Tuesday, an inferior continuation from Yusupov on the 17th
move let in Karpov's pieces to swarm around Yusupov's king.
   On the 24th move, Karpov sacrificed a knight to rip open the
pawn cover around Yusupov's king.
   Yusupov eventually emerged two pawns behind in a hopeless
endgame.
   Playing white in an English opening, Speelman gained an
initiative after an early exchange of queens and could have won a
pawn on the 19th move, experts said.
   But playing for bigger stakes, Speelman steered the game into
complications.
   With Timman having only 10 minutes for his last 13 moves,
Speelman made a weak 28th move that let Timman gain a pawn on the
31st move.
   Timman won a second pawn following a weak 45th move from
Speelman.
   Nine moves later, Speelman resigned.

   Rain offshore, not demonstrators or
mechanical problems, stopped the launch of the space shuttle
Atlantis and its nuclear-fueled cargo Tuesday.
   ``It looks like the local weather is not going to cooperate,
we're going to call it a day,'' launch director Bob Sieck told the
five astronauts who had been lying on their backs in Atlantis'
cabin for three hours.
   NASA said it will try again Wednesday at 12:50 p.m. EDT.
   But Tuesday night's earthquake in northern California gave the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration some concern. The
rocket which propels the Galileo space probe is controlled in
flight by an Air Force station in Sunnyvale, Calif. NASA said it
had received reports the station suffered some damage.
   The station's condition would have to be assessed before workers
started filling the shuttle's fuel tank early Wednesday, said Steve
Nesbitt, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   The launch opportunity _ determined by the relative positions of
Earth and Jupiter _ extends until 1:21 p.m.
   The outlook was not promising, with only a 60 percent prospect
for adequate weather Wednesday. Another scrub then and no further
attempt could be made until Friday at the earliest. The chances for
clear skies Friday were rated at 70 percent.
   NASA's last opportunity to launch the space probe is Nov. 21,
when Earth and Jupiter lose their favorable alignment. The launch
``window'' lengthens each day until Nov. 2, then gets shorter by
the day.
   The scrub cost NASA $624,000, more than half of that for the
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that had been pumped into the
shuttle's external fuel tank overnight.
   Atlantis's mission _ already delayed for seven years by budget
and other problems _ is to carry the 6,700-pound Galileo probe into
orbit, the start of its 2.4 billion-mile, six-year trip to Jupiter.
   The $1.5 billion Galileo is the most expensive and sophisticated
unmanned spacecraft ever built and is expected to give scientists
their best and closest look at another planet.
   The weather became a factor in the final hours of Tuesday's
countdown, with clouds building offshore and across the Kennedy
Space Center runway.
   The showers were in an area that Atlantis would have to pass
through if an engine were lost shortly after liftoff and the
astronauts had to attempt an emergency landing on the 15,000-foot
runway near the launch pad.
   Officials also worry that rain hitting a descending shuttle
could severely damage the fragile tiles that protect the vehicle
from heat during reentry from orbit.
   For a time it also appeared that all three emergency landing
sites, in Spain and Morocco, were unusable because of weather _
another reason for abandoning the launch attempt. But moments
before the final scrub the runway at Ben Guerir in Morocco was
deemed O.K.
   Protesters had tried to block the launch in court because
Galileo's two electrical generators are fueled by highly
radioactive plutonium. They feared an accident during launch, like
the explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger, would release
the plutonium in the atmosphere.
   But promised protests at the launch site did not materialize.
One man was arrested after declaring that he would walk through a
restricted gate. Eight boats were shepherded out of the protected
area offshore, but the Coast Guard said none appeared to be trying
to interfere with the launch.
   There were also no intrusions into the restricted airspace
around the launch site.
   ``It was a quiet day, not even a minor traffic accident,'' said
Gary Wistrand, the space center's deputy security director. The
same precautions will prevail Wednesday, he said, even though
protest groups had given no indication that attempts would be made
to interfere with the launch.
   To guard against unwarranted intrusions, about 200 armed
security guards were deployed around the 144,000-acre space center.
The government and its contractors had another 200 people ready to
monitor any release of plutonium.
   The countdown went without a hitch to the nine-minute mark and
Sieck held it there for several minutes to wait out the weather. He
then allowed the count to go down to the five-minute mark, hoping
showers would move out.
   NASA had only a 26-minute period during which Earth and Jupiter
were in proper alignment for a launch. Sieck had two minutes left
when he scrubbed.

   Authorities are trying to determine whether a
12-year-old girl was kidnapped in infancy or was given away by her
mother, who now wants her back from the woman who has raised her
ever since.
   Cynthia Anderson, 31, the girl's biological mother, was in a
grocery store Friday when she heard the voice of Maxine McCaslin,
43, who used to work for her as a baby sitter. She had not seen
McCaslin since 1977, when McCaslin and Anderson's 6-month-old
daughter both vanished.
   Anderson got McCaslin's license number and notified police.
Detective Mona Jaramillo said the women had lived just 17 blocks
apart for the last two years.
   The girl, who did not know about her biological mother until
Friday, was in a foster home until Tuesday, when Denver Juvenile
Court allowed her to return to McCaslin until the custody case can
be resolved, officials said.
   McCaslin, who reared the child from infancy, told police
Anderson asked her to care for the child because Anderson could not.
   ``It was hell keeping the secret,'' police quoted McCaslin as
saying.
   Anderson claims now that her daughter was kidnapped.
   However, Jaramillo said that in 1977 Anderson filed a complaint
against McCaslin over the custody of the child, but not a
kidnapping complaint.
   ``Our records indicated that the natural mother had turned this
child over to the other woman. It was not regarded as a kidnapping
back then,'' the detective said.
   There was no immediate explanation where McCaslin and the girl
had been until two years ago, why police had never located them, or
whether Anderson could have cared for the girl. There also was no
information immediately available about the girl's father.
   Jaramillo said police were unable to comment on the women's
whereabouts over the years because it is part of the investigation.
   McCaslin had an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment Tuesday. Anderson's lawyer, Dennis Blewitt of
Boulder, was out of his office and did not immediately return
calls. And police records are incomplete.
   ``I just can't give up hope _ and that's all I can say,''
Anderson said in a statement Monday. She could not be located for
additional comment Tuesday; no telephone number is listed for her.
   ``She's very distraught,'' Blewitt said, adding that Anderson
has bought birthday presents each year, hoping someday to locate
her daughter.
   ``Today, the Denver Department of Social Services refused to let
the mother see her daughter,'' Blewitt said. ``I don't know why,
but they said we `leaked' this to the press. We didn't, but
somebody did.''
   Blewitt said he knew nothing about the father.
   McCaslin told the girl of her history after both were taken to
police headquarters Friday night, police said.
   No charges had been filed.
   ``The stories are so conflicting it was impossible to prove the
case beyond a reasonable doubt,'' said Denver District Attorney
Norm Early.
   ``We are not sure whether we will file criminal charges against
McCaslin at this point,'' said Capt. Jim Fitzpatrick. ``The main
person we and the courts are concerned about at this point is the
victim.
   ``It's been hard on her. She never knew there was another woman
who claims to be her mother.''
   ``She has been well treated, has been raised in an excellent
environment and is a bright little girl,'' said Fitzpatrick.
   Detective Sgt. Gordon Reed, also involved in the investigation,
said there are many mitigating factors on both sides.
   ``The one real victim is the little girl. Her life, as she knew
it, has been destroyed,'' he said.
   Reed described it as ``probably the most tragic case I've seen
in 21 years with the Denver Police Department.''
   Authorities say many reports from the case have vanished in the
intervening years. Because of the complexity of the case police may
have to rely on memories of other police officers who investigated
the case 12 years ago, police said.
   Neighbors and school officials said the girl is a well-adjusted
seventh-grader, a B-plus student and a volleyball player at a
private school.
   A neighbor who tutors the child in math described her as ``a
wonderful little girl, a very well-mannered kid.''

<HEAD>Area Where Earthquake Hit Seen as Highly Probable in 1988 Report</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-SF Quake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major earthquake that struck the San
Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists
targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in
Northern California.
   A 1988 report by the U.S. Geological Survey placed the
probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale
at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.
   The high probability is based on several factors, including
length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in
1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at
the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.
   ``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake. It just has to
do with the probability of an earthquake in this area,'' Allen said.
   He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of Large
Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,''
presented information that was already widely known among
scientists. Allen said this information should have alerted
officials to take preventive steps.
   Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said
the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It was centered
in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A reading of 6 can cause severe damage. A quake of 7
magnitude, a ``major'' earthquake, is capable of widespread heavy
damage.
   Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday's
quake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.
   ``It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a
calamitous event. It's something we should therefore be ready
for,'' Allen said.
   The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of
structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los
Angeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.
   ``I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view
from this earthquake,'' he said. ``What will be important is to see
how the modern structures behaved.''
   Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that
appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the
Los Angeles region. In addition, some of the roadways and
overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction
as the Bay Bridge.
   In some areas of Southern California, there is a higher
probability of a major quake occurring. The highest, the USGS says,
is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90
percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.

   President Bush is prepared to veto a bill
allowing federally financed abortions in cases of rape and incest,
now that his spokesman says the White House is giving up efforts to
find a compromise.
   The White House abandoned the bid for a compromise after Chief
of Staff John Sununu met for a second day Monday with leading
anti-abortion congressmen.
   ``We have made every effort ... and have decided basically there
is not'' any possibility to find common ground, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``It's our judgment at this time that no one has been able to
provide a convincing reason for the president to change his
position'' opposing such funds, he said. ``So the president will

   Stock market investors are groping for stable
ground after two of the wildest days on Wall Street since the Crash
of 1987.
   Analysts said the market still might have some surprises in
store after the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks plummeted
190 points on Friday and leaped 88 points on Monday.
   ``The chances are pretty good that we'll see a brief lower low''
than Monday's bottom before the bull market resumes, said Bert
Dohmen, president of Wellington Financial Corp., an investment
management firm in Honolulu.
   The Dow fell about 63 points to about 2,505 in the first hour

   House leaders say they'll quickly pass an
emergency deficit bill to roll back automatic spending cuts once
they decide how to handle issues such as a capital gains tax cut
and Medicare catastrophic health care.
   President Bush signed an order Monday night implementing $16.1
billion in automatic Gramm-Rudman budget cuts after giving up hope
for a last-minute compromise with Congress.
   The White House and the Senate had pushed the House to accept
their deal on a ``stripped-down'' deficit package, which would have
allowed Bush to avoid the automatic cuts.
   ``We'll continue to work with the Congress'' on a compromise
plan to roll back the spending cuts, said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater. ``But there is some feeling here that (the
automatic cuts) are the way to go. It will reduce spending in a

Germany's ruling Politburo that could determine the future of
hard-line leader Erich Honecker.
   Monday's night's march, the largest single protest in the
nation's 40-year history, put new pressure on the government to
consider reforms. It also renewed speculation that the Politburo
might initiate a leadership change at its regular weekly meeting
late today.
   Honecker, 77, reportedly is under increasing pressure to step
down from within the ruling Communist Party.
   In Leipzig, protesters on Monday night carried placards

   Northern rebels have launched a

capital, and the guerrilla forces have inflicted defeats on
government troops.
   According to diplomats in Addis Ababa, the rebels have pushed
government forces back and reached nearly to Dese, 155 miles from
the capital.
   The reports could not be confirmed. But a rebel advance to Dese
would raise a threat of cutting the road between Addis Ababa and
the Red Sea port of Assab, site of Ethiopia's only oil refinery and
one of two key points of entry for tons of emergency relief food.
   One African diplomat said President Mengistu Haile Mariam's
forces would have act to halt the rebel advance before it becomes
serious trouble for the government.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened
sharply to $10.77 billion in August as imports flooded into the
country at a record pace, the government said Tuesday in a dose of
bad economic news that crimped the stock market's recovery.
   The Federal Reserve Board moved for the second straight day to
soothe investors' worries, pumping $1.5 billion into the banking
system a day after making a $2 billion cash infusion.
   The money is intended to calm jittery markets by showing the
Fed's resolve to make sure banks have enough reserves to keep loans
flowing to brokerage houses caught in a cash squeeze because of
falling stock prices.
   The Commerce Department said the August trade shortfall between
imports and exports was the largest imbalance in eight months and
was 31 percent bigger than a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.

   The stock market seesaw tipped downward again
Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 19 points
after briefly falling more than 60 points early in the day.
   Speculators and program traders yanked around a market still
deeply shaken by Friday's 190-point plunge and Monday's 88-point
recovery in the Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks.
   Stock prices held up fairly well despite continued uncertainty
surrounding a proposed buyout of United Airlines' parent company
and a government report showing a bigger-than-expected trade
deficit in August. The Federal Reserve helped by adding a modest
amount of reserves to the banking system.
   In a sign of the market's nervousness, stock index futures
plunged shortly before noon, which briefly dragged the Dow Jones
average 63 points below Monday's finish.
   The average closed with a loss of 18.65 points at 2,638.73 with
224.07 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
scarcely more than half Monday's volume.

   The Soviet Union's attitude toward human rights

   In a report published Wednesday, the worldwide human rights
movement says its list of Soviet citizens imprisoned for
non-violent exercise of their human rights shrank from 600 three
years ago to about 90 in July, and would have been lower but for
further arrests.
   An Amnesty International delegation was allowed into the Soviet
Union for the first time last March, and found that ``the Soviet
perspective on human rights has shifted dramatically since 1986,''
the report said.
   ``The most promising prospect for long-term reform is a major

   The U.S. energy picture for the 1990s is a blur of dark lines
and bright signs: doubt about ensuring stable prices and steady
supplies, but also promise of technological leaps toward a more
secure energy future.
   Such consumer advances as compact fluorescent light bulbs,
``superwindows'' that better insulate buildings, and more efficient
refrigerator motors are just over the horizon. The efficiency of
these new products should partly offset the expanded use of
electricity in the '90s.
   Energy projections over the past two decades have been
astonishingly far off the mark, proving that the energy economy is
too volatile to follow a predictable path. Even so, the consensus
view is that oil prices, now $16 to $18 a barrel, will hold fairly
steady in the early 1990s, and then move moderately higher.
   Analysts are quick to note, however, that the trend in oil
prices over the past two decades has been determined largely by
political events and market reactions almost no one foresaw.
   Experts say forces already at work point to key energy themes
for the 1990s:
   _More automobiles will be powered by fuels other than gasoline,
as the nation looks for environmentally safer alternatives that can
lessen dependence on foreign oil. Some may use hydrogen gas made
from water, using electricity generated by the sun. Fuels made from
natural gas, coal and grain are likely to become more common.
   _The federal government will push harder to revive atomic power.
Tax dollars may be used to develop a nuclear reactor with added
safety features, but public opposition to the atom is likely to
persist. A key focus of debate: how to store growing tons of
nuclear waste. Relatively ``clean'' energy from nuclear fusion will
remain only a distant prospect.
   _Decisions about developing traditional U.S. energy resources _
oil, natural gas and coal _ will become more intertwined with
worries about the harmful environmental effects of finding,
extracting, moving and burning these fossil fuels.
   _The nation will become more dependent on foreign oil and
natural gas as domestic oil producers look abroad for drilling
prospects.
   _Houses and commercial buildings will become more
energy-efficient, with compact fluorescent lights and other
advanced appliances, and ``superwindows'' whose glazing offers
greater protection from the extremes of the air outside.
   These trends suggest conflicting signals about American energy
fortunes in the next decade: new possibilities for popularizing
more benign fuels, but uncertainty about a commitment to move away
from the most polluting ones, especially oil.
   The Bush administration is already promoting a revival of
nuclear energy, stagnant since the mid-1970s, but electric
utilities say major changes in state and federal regulations will
be needed before they will build more plants.
   Complicating the outlook is a warning from the utility industry
and many energy analysts that some regions _ especially the
Northeast _ could face electricity shortages early in the 1990s.
Others foresee plenty of power if the government does more to push
energy efficiency and conservation.
   While energy sources favored by environmentalists _ including
``renewables,'' such as sunlight, wind, water, wood and geothermal
steam _ are likely to gain more favor in the next decade, America
and the world still will run mainly on oil.
   Modern economies, quite simply, are wedded to oil. Little could
change that in the 1990s.
   ``It is and will continue to be the critical commodity in all of
our economic and strategic planning well into the next century,''
said Henson Moore, the deputy U.S. energy secretary.
   Joseph Stanislaw, an analyst in the Paris office of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, said the United States will face an oil
crunch sometime in the 1990s if, as expected, U.S. oil production
keeps falling and demand keeps rising.
   ``We're like a shark driving through the water wanting more and
more imported oil,'' he said.
   Critical, too, then, will be the actions of the OPEC oil cartel,
which teetered on the brink of extinction in the mid-1980s but now
seems poised for a comeback.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries engineered one
of history's greatest transfers of wealth when it jacked up oil
prices after the 1973-74 Arab embargo against the United States and
again in 1979 when oil buyers reacted with panic to a shutoff of
Iranian oil output.
   Almost no one in the West had foreseen those events. Nor did
many expect the crises to create an energy conservation ``chic''
that would quickly discredit the mid-1970s predictions that oil
soon would shoot up to $100 a barrel.
   After peaking at $40 a barrel in 1980, oil's price fell
steadily, capped by a stunning _ and largely unforeseen _ collapse
in 1986 to below $10 a barrel.
   Although energy developments of the past decade were largely a
reaction to the oil price pain of the '70s, trends in the coming 10
years are likely to be determined by still-emerging responses to
the price declines of the '80s.
   The key uncertainties:
   _Will the nation's rapidly growing dependence on foreign oil
undermine its security?
   _Will oil imports rise so rapidly as to give OPEC renewed power
to dictate prices?
   _If prices do stay low, will efforts to develop alternate energy
sources be abandoned? Will that, in the longer run, make the
country even more beholden to OPEC?

<TEXT>
   Brian Denehy left Vietnam and the Marine Corps
in 1965, having, he says, ``seen a lot about what life is and how
fragile life is.'' He decided then what he wanted to do with the
rest of his life.
   He wanted to act.
   He has done that, and then some. At 51, he's one of the busiest
``name'' character actors around. The roles include a rotten
sheriff in ``Silverado,'' a tough New York cop in ``Gorky Park,'' a
philosophical barkeep in ``10.''
   On Oct. 28, he'll co-star in a Home Box Office movie, ``Perfect
Witness,'' essaying a cynical, ambitious, yet sentimental U.S.
attorney in a drama about an eyewitness to a contract killing in a
working-class bar here.
   Later this year, he'll return on behalf of the law as a
prosecutor in a new movie, ``Presumed Innocent,'' playing Harrison
Ford's boss.
   It hasn't been an overnight trip to the big bucks, the better
roles. ``My career has been gradual,'' he says. ``Which is good in
a way. Because you stay around longer in a way.''
   There have been reports that Denehy came to his calling
relatively late in life, in his mid-thirties. Not so, he says:
   ``I was always trying to be an actor, but with three kids to
support'' _ all daughters _ ``I was also driving a truck, also a
cab. I even worked as a stockbroker for a while. I was the worst
stockbroker in the history of the market.''
   ``It wasn't so much that I came late to acting. It was that
success came late to me. I was 35 or 36 before I started to get the
ball out of the infield.''
   The major breakthrough, in 1979, was ``10,'' the Bo Derek-Dudley
Moore comedy. Denehy, who has a degree in history from Columbia
University, chuckled when asked if, during his scuffling days, his
kids ever asked when he was going to hang it up and get a real job.
   ``No, but my old man certainly did,'' he said. ``Thank God he
saw it all happen before he died. He got a big kick out of it, he
loved it. But it was a long time between drinks of water for him,
too.''
   His father, Ed Denehy, was a respected Associated Press editor
in New York.
   One lesson learned by watching and listening to his father
always stuck with Denehy: ``He had passion, he really loved his
job. He cared about his work, and it was everything to him.
   ``That's the kind of life I try to live _ to find something that
makes you passionate and then do it. I've tried to communicate that
to my kids and I think I've done it.''
   He mock-sighed. ``Unfortunately, I may have done it a little too
successfully, since two of them are actors.''
   Denehy, whose scuffling days as an actor started in New York
theater, is starting to revisit the stage. He returned here last
year in an acclaimed production of ``The Cherry Orchard'' at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music.
   Next spring, in Chicago, he hopes to play what he calls ``the
big one'' for any Irish-American actor _ Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's
``The Iceman Cometh.''
   But next month, he only intends to relax in Santa Fe, N.M.,
where he and his wife moved last year. They bought an old adobe
house and fixed it up.
   They formerly lived in Los Angeles, where it is said you can
hear the sparrows coughing at dawn. Los Angeles wasn't bad, he
insists. But the traffic got to him. He hasn't that problem in
Santa Fe.
   ``I just love it,'' he says. ``I just love to leave my house and
walk up into the mountains. I can be there in 10 minutes.''

<HEAD>Yes, Stocks Do Have Enduring Value</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Had you begun investing $1,000 a year in stocks
back in 1973 you might have an equity portfolio today worth more
than $50,000.
   Yes, you can trust the stock market. Give it time and it always
produces for those who choose wisely. But try to outwit it in the
short term and it can fight you to the death, professional or
amateur.
   That $50,000-plus portfolio, precisely $52,740 at the end of
1988, is the result of a theoretical $1,000 a year invested in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index _ theoretical because there was
no vehicle for so doing in 1973.
   The point, however, is that the payoff would have come not from
any maneuvering or spectacular luck, but simply by playing the
averages.
   Over time the averages work in your favor. When the latest rages
consume themselves and the fads lose their fans, as sometimes
happens overnight, stock prices return to their basic values, based
on corporate quality.
   But time, or its expression in patience, is seldom talked about
in a marketplace where day-to-day movements are magnified, where
advice changes by the hour, where a premium is placed on
anticipating daily movements.
   Time and quality work everytime, even when economic hurricanes
blow away short-term values. Even through a depression.
   Ralph Tate relates that had you begun investing $1,000 a year in
stocks in 1926, and continued to do so through the Great
Depression, your account - based on the averages _ might have grown
to $19,700 by the end of 1940.
   Tate is an officer of Aetna Equity Investors, which analyzes
with actuarial precision the investments of its parent, the big
insurance company. Because of their nature, insurers must rely on
rather steady, long-term performance.
   Long-term, however, is not even in the vocabulary of many stock
market participants. They seek to ``play'' the market. ``That one
phrase does more harm to investing than any other,'' says Peter
Lynch.
   Lynch runs the Fidelity Magellan Fund, a huge mutual fund that
owns records for long-term performance. The phrase, he said in an
interview prior to the latest debacle, causes people to think in
terms of markets, not companies.
   And, he adds, the verb ``play'' means no work and instant
gratification.
   Too many people, he contends, fail to do their homework. Before
they buy a refrigerator, he says, they examine the models and
prices. But then they put $10,000 into an inferior stock and say
the market is rigged if it sinks.
   ``If only they did one-hour's work,'' he said. ``You have an
obligation to study and remain informed _ to be responsible to
yourself.'' Investors, he repeated, must know the fundamentals of
companies whose shares they own.
   They cannot panic. ``Individual stocks are volatile. My fund is
volatile. In the past 12 years it has declined 10 to 30 percent
eight times.'' But, he suggested, if you own fundamental value you
can hold tight and win out.
   Knowing value means knowing everything you can about a company,
especially about the quality of its management, its financial
condition, its products, its earnings history. It means monitoring
the company for any changes.
   It means standing firm when others lose their heads about
economic events. ``To spend time trying to predict the economy or
the stock market just takes time out of your week,'' says Lynch.
``You've got to study companies.''
   That's the word from a man extolled as one of the country's
wisest and most successful long-term money managers. You don't
worry about what the economy might do or the seers are saying. You
ignore the screams of the marketplace.
   Easier said than done? Of course. Otherwise it would be too
easy. ``Everyone has the intelligence to make money in stocks,''
says Lynch. ``Do they have the stomach?''
   Says Tate: People remember Babe Ruth's 714 homers better than
his 1,330 strikeouts, and they should think the same way about the
stock market.
   In a comment made before the latest sharp decline, Tate wished
that more Americans would recognize ``the quality of the stock
market's longer term slugging percentage and not focus on the
occassional dramatic strikeout.''

   Every two days, Americans generate almost a
billion pounds of garbage. The dumps can no longer hold it all.
This is one of a periodic series of articles, ``The '90s,'' looking
ahead to the promise and peril of the upcoming decade, in the
environment, medicine, technology and society.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   By the end of the 1990s, you may be paying by the pound to get
rid of your garbage. Your home could have more recycling bins than
trash cans. And your supermarket food will probably come with a
little less super-wrapping.
   Solid-waste specialists say such changes are inevitable because
of an upcoming crunch on the garbage front: Half the nation's 6,000
dumps will be filled and closed in the '90s.
   The ride into the ``recycling decade'' may be bumpy. Buyers for
recycled newspaper, glass and plastic are sometimes difficult to
find. Breaking the generations-old habit of tossing everything into
one garbage can may prove daunting. New recycling systems need
hefty up-front appropriations.
   But the specialists see overwhelming motivations for change:
   _The cost of simply throwing things away is rising, as
communities ship their garbage farther and farther away, and new
environmental regulations make dump maintenance more expensive.
   _People are growing more concerned about cleaning up the planet.
A Media General-Associated Press poll earlier this year found that
87 percent of Americans would back a requirement to separate their
trash for recycling.
   ``Environmental awareness is growing by leaps and bounds,'' said
Sylvia Lowrance, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's
office of solid waste. ``We're going to see a lot of peer pressure,
neighborly pressure on people not to throw away everything.''
   In garbage, the future is also the past. Greater recycling and
reuse of discarded material would represent a return to pre-World
War II ways in America, including fewer-frills packaging on food
products.
   ``By the end of the decade, I think recycling is going to be
part of the cultural fabric of society,'' said Bruce Weddle,
director of EPA's municipal solid waste program. ``People will be
separating out all bottles, cans, newspapers, plastics, leaves and
grass clippings instead of throwing them in one can.''
   The transition will not occur overnight, the experts say. But
``even with the recalcitrant ones,'' said Lowrance, ``when it hits
their pocketbook, they are going to become recyclers.''
   As it is now, many communities go to great lengths to dump their
garbage.
   Northeast states truck trash hundreds of miles to Midwest dumps.
West Coast cities ship it by rail to rural landfills because their
hometown dumps have closed. But much of the interstate garbage
business is in jeopardy because landfills are closing and local
residents oppose opening new ones to the out-of-state waste.
   In addition, new EPA landfill regulations due out in December
will accelerate the garbage crunch by shutting down many antiquated
dumps, Lowrance said. She said the rules will require dump
inspections and multi-layered dump liners, which prevent liquid
from contaminating groundwater. About 80 percent of the nation's
dumps do not have liners.
   Although all this makes recycling look more attractive, most
garbage specialists say recycling alone will not solve the garbage
crisis.
   They foresee a need to keep establishing new dumps, especially
sites serving entire regions, and the building of more incinerators.
   Federal officials say the proportion of the nation's garbage to
go up in smoke from incinerators could rise by the year 2000 to 25
percent from 10 percent. The United States now has 149
incinerators; 227 are expected to be on line in 1992. Incinerators
have been opposed by environmentalists, concerned over air
pollution and the problem of disposing of toxic ash.
   Former EPA administrator William Ruckelshaus, now chief
executive of Browning-Ferris Industries, a solid-waste management
company, believes the garbage crisis demands an integrated solution
of recycling, burying and burning. In a telephone interview, he
said local residents across the country have thwarted this approach
by blocking new dumps and incinerators.
   ``The idea that we are out of space is ridiculous. EPA needs to
encourage states to adopt integrated energy plans,'' he said.
   Americans now bury about 80 percent of their waste in dumps,
burn 10 percent and recycle the remainder. The EPA predicts
recycling will jump to 25 percent by 1992. Some states, such as
Massachusetts, have set a 50 percent recycling goal by the year
2000. That would mean widespread recovery of food and yard waste,
which amounts to 23 percent of what is buried in dumps.
   Ten states now require communities to establish recycling
programs. And the the nation's largest city, New York, has just
embarked on a phased-in mandatory recycling program.
   In Seattle, where the city's last dump closed three years ago,
residents pay $13.75 a month per garbage can for curbside pickup.
In one neighborhood, the city is experimenting with weighing
individual households' garbage. Garbagemen enter the weight into a
truck-board computer, and the bill is sent later.
   Seattle's recycling is free. Residents separate newspapers, junk
mail, aluminum, grass clippings and even old latex paint.
   Said Ginny Stevenson, spokeswoman for the city's recycling
program, ``The pocketbook was probably the biggest instigator for
people to get involved in recycling.''
   As if to herald the ``recycling decade,'' a new magazine on
solid-waste management has arrived on the scene just in time for
the 1990s. It's called simply ``Garbage.'' And it's printed on
recycled paper.

   To a new breed of environmentalist, this
Northwest metropolis is a Mecca.
   ``We do dream about a different world,'' says waste reduction
project manager Lorie Parker, one of nine Seattle city employees
plotting new ways to recycle solid waste. ``We want to make
recycling just as easy as throwing away garbage.''
   A new city booklet that shows the way, ``On the Road to
Recovery,'' is being read by garbage specialists across the country.
   The publication outlines the city's plans to recycle 60 percent
of its waste by the end of the 1990s. By the year 2010, the booklet
predicts, residents ``are buying more durable products than
disposable products. They are buying products with little or no
packaging. ... Most homes have only one waste can, but every room
has a recycle can. ...
   ``Processing the recyclables has become a major industry in
Seattle, employing hundreds of people.''
   In 1987, the city recycled 24 percent of its waste. It is now up
to 34 percent, after starting its voluntary program last year.
   Residents recycle newspapers, waste paper, glass, aluminum, some
plastics, household toxic wastes ad steel garbage
cans. Trucks pick up the separated material, whcurbsides.
   nd even their olRecycling is free, but residents are charged by the
barrel for
trash _ $13.75 a month per garbage can for curbside pickup.
   The city's next recycling target is food and yard waste _
leaves, grass clippings and the like. Officials want it collected,
processed, composted and sold back to residents as high-grade mulch.
   Seattle is also experimenting with weighing people's garbage and
charging by the pound, and is considering an intensive education
program promoting the purchase of ich is left on
durable goods, the reuse of
products and avoiding excessive packaging.
   The rest of the country is watching Seattle's progress.
   Said Bruce Weddle, director of the Environmental Protection
Agency's municipal waste program, ``If I were a local official, I'd
look very closely at it.''

   gained in the 1987 crash. The New York Stock Exchange managed to
handle the heavy volume because of a big investment in technology
made after Black Monday 1987.
   In addition, traders were soothed by a promise during the
weekend by the Federal Reserve to supply fresh money to the
financial system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing
to traders who lost money.
   It turned out that little Fed action was necessary. As a
precaution, the central bank injected about $2 billion into the
financial system on a day when it ordinarily would have drained
reserves.
   Turmoil continued in the airline sector. Donald Trump announced
he was withdrawing his $7 billion bid for AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines, after the company's stock had fallen. He said he
would consider a new offer at a lower price.
   It was a failure to obtain financing for an employee-management
buyout of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that sparked Friday's
plunge. A spokesman for British Airways, which is backing the
buyout group, said the group planned to pursue a takeover, although
the terms of the deal were under review.

<HEAD>West Point-Pepperell Agrees To Sell Cluett Peabody Divisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. has agreed to sell
three of Cluett Peabody &amp; Co.'s four principal divisions to a
French fashion and apparel firm for $600 million.
   Cluett Peabody Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of Bidermann
Industries USA, said it would acquire the divisions from the
Georgia-based textile giant. The French company did not specify
which three divisions were involved.
   The deal is expected to be completed by the end of November.
   William Farley, chairman of West Point-Pepperell, said in a
statement Monday, ``We are very pleased by the execution of this
agreement to sell Cluett to Bidermann.''
   Farley Inc., Farley's Chicago-based holding company, acquired
Pepperell earlier this year. It reportedly wants to sell Cluett
Peabody divisions to pay off some of the debt it took on in the $3
billion Pepperell deal.
   Cluett Peabody manufactures men's clothing such as Arrow shirts,
Schoeneman suits and Gold Toe socks. Bidermann Industries is the
principal subsidiary of Bidermann Group, which makes and markets
men's and women's branded and designer collections.
   Cluett is worth $450 million and $500 million, said Josie
Esquivel, a textile and apparel analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. Farley had reportedly sought $700 million to $800 million for
the company.

   Wall Street averted another Black Monday and had
a Blue Chip Monday instead, as some of the heaviest trading in
history produced a rally in big-name stocks and losses in many
smaller issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, benefiting from a
``flight to quality,'' rose 88.12 points, or 3.4 percent, to
2,657.38, erasing nearly half the losses suffered in last week's
Friday the 13th plunge.
   The gain was the fourth-biggest point rise on record, although
it did not rank among the top percentage gainers. Volume totaled
416.29 million shares, also the fourth largest in history.

   Stock markets around the world tumbled as foreigners reacted to
Wall Street's Friday plunge with a deluge of sell orders that
clogged exchanges from Tokyo to Lisbon.
   But analysts said that despite sharp drops in stock prices
Monday, the global backlash was nowhere near what it was two years
ago in the wake of Wall Street's Black Monday collapse.
   In Tokyo, the key 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down
647.33 points, or 1.8 percent, at 34,468.69. London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down by more than 9
percent at one point but finished at its high of the day, off 70.5
points, or 3.2 percent, at 2,163.40.

cash buyout offer made for the parent of United Airlines by a

buyout group announced it could not obtain financing for its

   Parties to the buyout said Monday that all sides were working to

<HEAD>A Glossary of Financial Market Terms</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PAM-Markets Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a glossary of some frequently used terms
related to the stock market:
   BARGAIN HUNTERS: Investors looking to buy shares at reduced
prices in a period of market decline.
   BLACK MONDAY: Refers to the Oct. 19, 1987, plunge that saw the
Dow Jones industrial average fall a record 22.6 percent. The term
previously referred to the Oct. 28, 1929, selloff, also known as
the Great Crash, when the Dow industrials fell 12.8 percent and
helped trigger the Great Depression.
   CIRCUIT BREAKERS: A post-crash system of rules to temporarily
halt trading of stocks and futures contracts when prices plummet.
   COMPUTERIZED PROGRAM TRADING: A computer-run strategy enabling
big institutional investors to make lightning-quick trades of huge
amounts of stocks, stock index futures and options on index futures
in attempts to profit from price disparities among these markets.
   DIVIDEND: A payment made to shareholders of a corporation from
earnings, payable at a fixed rate on preferred shares and at a
varying rate, according to the size of profits, on common shares.
   DOW JONES AVERAGE: Refers to the Dow Jones &amp; Co. average of
stock prices of 30 major industrial companies, a closely watched
barometer of blue-chip issues.
   EXPRESS SERVICE: A New York Stock Exchange service that puts
individual orders of up to 2,099 shares ahead of big, institutional
orders, generally on days when there is a 25-point change in the
Dow industrials.
   GREAT CRASH: The stock market collapse that occurred on ``Black
Monday,'' Oct. 28, 1929, when the Dow Jones average dropped 12.8
percent. The historic event helped trigger the Depression of the
1930s.
   INDEX ARBITRAGE: The purchase of a stock-index future in one
market and sale of the stocks that comprise that index in another
market, or vice versa, in order to profit from temporary price
differences in the two markets. Index arbitrage is the most widely
used form of computerized program trading.
   MARGIN ACCOUNT: A credit line enabling an investor to speculate
in the market with shares bought with borrowed money that is backed
by collateral such as the investor's stock holdings. Under Federal
Reserve regulations, investors may borrow up to 50 percent of the
value of a stock purchase. When the value of an investor's
collateral falls below the amount of money the investor has
borrowed to buy stock, a brokerage firm will make a ``margin call''
requiring the investor to put up more collateral or face the forced
sale of the stock.
   MUTUAL FUND: An organization that invests the money of its
shareholders in a diversified group of securities of various
corporations.
   OPTION: An agreement, usually for a fee, that permits an
investor to buy or sell a stock or a stock index future within a
specified time period in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
   PORTFOLIO INSURANCE: A strategy in which investors sell options
or futures against the underlying stock in a portfolio to offset
price declines and enhance price increases. The strategy widely
fell out of favor after the 1987 market crash.
   SHORT SELLING: The practice of selling borrowed securities,
expecting to be able to buy them later at a lower price before
having to return them to the lender.
   STOCK: The permanently invested capital of a corporation
contributed by the owners when the corporation is organized and
then divided into shares, each representing a proportionate
ownership in the company. Common stock enjoys an exclusive claim to
net assets and profits of a corporation if no other class of stock
is issued. Preferred stock, when issued, takes precedence over
common stock according to specified terms.
   STOCK INDEX FUTURES: Contracts that allow investors to buy and
sell theoretical packages of stocks for delivery at a future date.
   TRADING HALT: A measure designed to check a steep slide in the
stock market.
   VOLATILITY: Wild price swings in stock trading.
   YIELD: The difference between the purchase price and the face
value of a security.

Hesse, a former Energy Department official, has served on the
commission for three years, all as chairwoman. Her term was to

   Allday will be nominated to a four-year term in the seat now
held by Charles G. Stalon, the White House said, and he will be
designated chairman upon confirmation by the Senate.
   Bush lived in Midland during his years as a Texas oilman. Allday
practiced law there from 1959 until last year.

   Here is look at the stock market's performance
Monday and why it happened.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHAT HAPPENED:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones industrials average of 30 major stocks rose 88.12
points, or 3.4 percent, to 2,657.38. The rebound, the fourth
largest in history, erased nearly half the losses suffered in last
week's Friday the 13th plunge, when the Dow Jones average fell
190.58 points.
   Volume totaled 416.29 million shares, the fourth highest ever.
   Broader indicators of the market were mixed. Declining issues
outnumbered gaining ones 5 to 4 in the overall tally of New York
Stock Exchange issues. The American Stock Exchange index and
over-the-counter index fell, but the New York Stock Exchange index
and Wilshire Equity Index were higher.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHY IT HAPPENED:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said many traders concluded that Friday's sharp drop
was an overreaction, and that the lower prices for stocks presented
buying opportunities. Investors concentrated their buying in
blue-chip stocks such as the Dow Jones industrial average
components because they were nervous about the market's outlook and
preferred high-quality issues, especially ones that would stand up
well in case of a recession.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHAT IT MEANS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market historically has been regarded as a barometer
and forecaster of economic health, so the gyrations of Friday and
Monday raised questions about the outlook for the broader economy.
But economists say the short-term behavior of the market does not
give any clear picture about whether inflation or recession is more
or less likely.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>REFORMS SINCE THE CRASH:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   After Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the nation's major stock and
futures exchanges voluntarily began cooperating to avoid panicky
selling that could contribute to similar collapses in the future.
   Few of those provisions went into effect Monday. One feature was
tripped when Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures contracts fell 5
points at the opening. An opening 5-point drop in those contracts
traded on the Chicago Merc triggers a 10-minute period during which
those contracts cannot be traded at any lower price.
   A spokeswoman for the Merc, Julie Jacobs, said that on Monday
buyers surfaced within seconds at prices matching or higher than
the opening price and trading was never interrupted.

   Compaq Computer Corp. has unveiled a pair of
long-expected 6-pound ``notebook'' computers that have full
personal computer features but fit on top of a regular sheet of
paper.
   The Compaq LTE and LTE-286 don't have batteries or screens as
good as the ones in the new Portable Macintosh from Apple Computer
Inc. but they are much smaller and lighter than Apple's entries.
   The Compaq machines, unveiled Monday, also have more power than
other ``notebook'' computers from NEC Corp. and Zenith Data Systems
Inc., which are more direct competitors than Apple's because they
run the same software.
   The computers measure 2 inches high and are 8{ inches by 11
inches on the sides. They have more than 3{ hours of battery life.
They range in price from $2,399 to $4,999.
   Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive, said in an
interview that orders from dealers had been strong. ``We believe
we're going to kind of define this marketplace,'' he said.

   Donald Trump's $7.5 billion buyout proposal for
AMR Corp. was one of the casualties of the upheaval on Wall Street,
but observers expect the takeover business to recover.
   Trump himself indicated Monday that he doesn't think the
takeover game is over. Although he shelved his $120-a-share bid for
AMR, he said he may yet make another offer at a lower price for the
parent of American Airlines.
   The developer attributed his withdrawal to the drop in AMR's
stock price _ he canceled his proposed bid after the price tumbled
$13.75 a share to $84.87{ _ and the volatility on Wall Street. AMR
closed $22.12{ lower on the day at $76.50.
   The Dow Jones industrial average recovered 88 points Monday
after plunging 190 points Friday, but other stocks lagged behind
blue-chip issues.
   If the takeover business follows the precedent set after the
market collapse of October 1987 _ when the Dow Jones average lost
508 points on Black Monday alone _ it will go through a lull and
then emerge from this crisis largely unscathed.
   Two years ago, several takeover deals were abandoned or put on
hold because the plunge in stock prices made the pre-crash offers
too expensive.
   Carl Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., postponed his
plans to take the airline private, and Dart Group Corp. gave up its
$6.62 billion bid for the retailer Dayton Hudson Corp.
   But Icahn achieved his goal a year later, and although Dart did
not renew its offer for Dayton Hudson, the company was back on the
takeover trail just three months after the crash with an
unsuccessful bid for Stop &amp; Shop Cos. Inc.
   And if you look at the broader picture, some of the biggest
takeovers of all time _ including the record $24.53 billion buyout
of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and the $12.9
billion acquisition of Kraft Inc. by Philip Morris Cos. Inc. _ were
under way within a year of Black Monday.
   ``I don't think (the market scare) will have any long-term
impact,'' said Israel Shaked, a professor at Boston University's
School of Management, looking at the record of takeovers since the
1987 crash.
   ``As long as we have companies that are undervalued and
companies that are mismanaged, takeovers will exist,'' Shaked said.
   There may be changes in how deals are financed, however,
especially because of recent reverses in the market for high
yielding junk bonds.
   The junk-bond market was shaken recently after several big
buyouts, including Campeau Corp.'s $6.6 billion takeover of
Federated Department Stores Inc., ran into trouble because the
target firms weren't generating enough cash to meet interest
payments on the risky debt securities.
   And although the planned employee-management buyout of UAL Corp.
didn't involve junk bonds, the failure of banks to come up with
loans to finance the $6.75 billion deal helped trigger Friday's
market tailspin.
   Bernard Black, a corporate finance professor at the Columbia
University School of Law, said buyers may be forced to depend more
on equity and less on debt to complete their deals.
   Still, deals will be aided by lower stock prices, because the
cost of buying a company falls along with the price of the firm's
shares.
   ``Low stock prices should be good for takeovers, not bad,''
Black said. ``We had nice healthy takeovers in 1983-86 with
substantially lower prices.''

   When the results of the past few tumultuous days
on Wall Street are eventually added up, many analysts contend they
will mean more pluses than minuses for American consumers and
businesses.
   Monday's 88.12-point rally in the Dow Jones industrial average,
to 2,657.38, went a long way toward calming fears that the stock
market was headed for some sort of replay of the Crash of 1987.
   In addition, the rebound seemed to buttress the view that
Friday's 190-point drop in the Dow stemmed mainly from concerns
about a single question _ the fading boom in corporate buyouts
financed with borrowed money.
   Stocks of two airline holding companies, UAL Corp. and AMR
Corp., plunged in Monday's trading, responding to news that
takeover proposals had run into snags or been withdrawn.
   But in marked contrast to Friday's session, the shares of many
blue-chip companies not involved in takeover news or rumors staged
a strong advance.
   If takeover speculation is indeed on the wane, observers say, it
would take away one of the prime forces that carried the stock
market to record highs as recently as a week ago Monday.
   However, they argue, it also could reduce the perils of credit
risk in the economy.
   ``The unwinding of excesses in leveraged buyouts and junk bonds
is very healthy,'' said Edward Yardeni, an economist at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Since the collapse of stock prices two years ago,
economy-watchers have come to see sudden swings in the financial
market in a new light.
   Unlike many past debacles, the Crash of 1987 neither
foreshadowed nor caused a recession. In fact, many analysts
contend, it may have helped keep the economy in healthy shape, in
part by prompting the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Similarly, the jolt of Friday's selloff ``is likely to shake the
Fed into a more accommodative stance than it would have otherwise
pursued,'' said David Resler, an economist at Nomura Securities
International in New York.
   ``If we do see a recession in 1990, I don't think it would be a
result of this market drop.''
   If anything troubled observers about the stock market's recent
behavior, strange as it may sound, it was not so much Friday's
slump as it was the abrupt rebound Monday.
   The comeback seemed to betoken complacency, and perhaps an
all-too-eager readiness to dismiss the pre-weekend scare as a
harmless ``correction.''
   Yardeni, for one, suggested that the optimists might be
overlooking a developing downward trend in corporate profits and
other vital signs of the pace of business activity. ``There is some
genuine softness in the economy,'' he said.
   But as the market closed Monday evening, few observers claimed
they would have been preferred to go through another full-blown
crash.
   As for investors in stocks, mutual funds and other securities,
the markets' wild gyrations seemed to make a new and compelling
case for taking a long-term perspective.
   The volatile hour-by-hour atmosphere was full of potential
pitfalls for anyone who tried to anticipate or react to short-term
price fluctuations. For those who chose instead to ride out the
storm, the Dow Jones industrials' Monday close left it less than
two points away from where it stood three weeks earlier, at
2,659.19 on Sept. 25.

   Donald Dinsmore stepped outside and puffed
nervously on a Macanudo cigar during a break from a morning of
frantic stock trading. Ten feet away, scraggly anarchists burned
fake money and shouted ``Look out for falling stockbrokers!''
   Also outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, helmeted
police flanked Japanese tourists waiting for a tour of the capital
of capitalism.
   ``It's the place to be this morning in New York,'' said Laurent
Bijard, 32, a writer for the French magazine Le Point visiting the
city.
   Inside, 12 minutes of frenetic floor activity defined a day that
many feared would be a replay of Black Monday 1987, when the Dow
Jones industrial average plunged 508 points in the greatest one-day
crash ever.
   At 10:10 a.m., the Dow average of 30 blue-chip stocks was down
63.13 points and falling. Six minutes later, screams and cheers
erupted when the critical market barometer recovered to stand less
than 50 points down.
   At 10:18 it was down 39 points. A minute later, 29. Another
minute, 10. More jubilation at 10:22.28, when the Dow moved into
the black, up 0.41 point. The rise continued and the Dow closed up
88.12 points, erasing nearly half its Friday the 13th dive that
gave the market the willies.
   ``I had butterflies in my stomach,'' said Dinsmore, a
56-year-old floor specialist who has worked at the exchange 30
years. ``There was a lot of money on the line.''
   Dinsmore said he doesn't drink but had plans for the day's end
anyway: ``I'll have a good stiff cigar.''
   As on previous occasions when the stock market made big news,
protesters flocked to Wall Street. About a dozen police officers,
some on horseback and others on motorcycles, were deployed nearby.
   A group of self-described anarchist ``squatters'' who occupy
abandoned city-owned buildings rooted for another crash. One
black-scarved protester held a sign reading ``Down With the Dow,
Revolution Now.''
   ``For society to be reorganized, the economic structure first
has to experience a debilitating crash,'' said a protester who gave
his name as John Squat. ``We believe, of course, that a revolution
would be what would come out of it.''
   The stock exchange closed its visitors' gallery, deploying
tan-uniformed sentries at all entrances. But that didn't stop
scores of curious tourists from milling around the building.
   ``It might be a swell piece of history,'' said John Bissell, 58,
a textile exporter from Canton, Conn.
   While protesters shouted ``Look out for falling stockbrokers!''
in an enduring image of the Great Crash of 1929, one wag walking
down Wall Street before the market opened said: ``They locked all
the windows so they can't jump out.''

   Turmoil in the stock market is drawing attention
once again to the sleepy area of financial services advertising.
   The admakers at PaineWebber Inc. scrambled Monday afternoon to
make a new version of their long-running ``PaineWebber Special
Reports'' commercials that give the views of some of its top
executives.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., meanwhile, unveiled a new campaign
debuting Wednesday in which it stakes its claim to an industry
leadership role.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was already on the air during Sunday's
baseball World Series broadcast with commercials it has used before
with the tagline ``A Tradition of Trust.''
   But Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. isn't likely to rerun the
advertisement it placed in Friday's Wall Street Journal anytime
soon.
   ``What does an old-fashioned investment firm say to someone who
fled to CD's two years ago?'' the ad said. ``The environment that
drove you into CD's is not the environment of 1989.''
   ``The timing wasn't exactly propitious,'' spokesman Bob Connor
conceded Monday even as the Dow Jones industrial average recouped
88.12 points of the 190.58 it lost Friday. ``I don't think we'll
run it again this week.''
   Financial services advertising has been in the doldrums since
spending fell sharply after the October 1987 market crash.
   Financial advertising on network television, for instance, was
down 25 percent from a year ago in the first six months of 1989,
according to the Television Bureau of Advertising.
   Advertising in the print media also has been soft, as evinced by
Dow Jones &amp; Co.'s report last week that ad linage in The Wall
Street Journal was down 7.9 percent in the first nine months of the
year.
   The stock market's sharp selloff Friday afternoon left no time
for most financial services companies to come up with new
advertising for the weekend.
   But moments after the market closed Monday afternoon,
PaineWebber was recording Mary Farrell, a senior vice president and
investment strategist, for a one-minute commercial on her view of
market developments.
   The message: Farrell says that although wide swings may be
inevitable in the short term, the stock market ``is still the place
to be for long-term appreciation.''
   Some critics say investor confidence in the market is so low few
people will pay any attention to such pronouncements.
   But John Lampe, advertising director for PaineWebber, said he
wanted to get the commercial on the air immediately.
   ``It shows the people that are watching the commercials that we
are on top of what is going on in the marketplace and are trying to
be upfront and candid about our advice,'' he said.
   Shearson hired a new ad agency last spring, and the new campaign
``Leadership by Example'' is the first offering produced by Ally &amp;
Gargano Inc.
   Hardwick Simmons, Shearson's vice chairman, said the ads were
designed to tout the firm's leadership role in areas such as
over-the-counter stocks, municipal bonds and assets under
management without making the firm ``appear arrogant or
Yuppie-like.''
   Five commercials have been created. In one, a European company
in need of $300 million is depicted as turning to Shearson, which
tapped its Tokyo, New York and Geneva offices to arrange low cost
financing within 24 hours.
   In another ad, scenes of Russians, Chinese and East Europeans
enjoying the fruits of capitalism _ like skateboards, hot dogs and
fancy sneakers _ are shown to illustrate that Shearson stands ready
to ``help expand the free enterprise system globally.''
   The campaign and the scheduling of its debut during Wednesday
night's boradcast of the World Series baseball game were determined
well before Friday's market fall and Monday's partial recovery.

   A House aviation subcommittee approved
legislation requiring government review of takeovers of major
airlines after witnesses said leveraged buyouts could threaten
safety if purchasers are servicing their debt instead of serving
their passengers.
   The bill, passed Monday by voice vote, would give the
Transportation Department up to 50 days to block the purchase of at
least 15 percent of a major carrier's voting stock.
   The fast action on the bill, introduced only last week, was
spurred by Donald Trump's proposed $7.5 billion takeover of AMR
Corp. of Fort Worth, parent of American Airlines. But Trump said
Monday he was withdrawing his offer, although he may come back
later with another proposal.
   In a letter to Rep. James L. Oberstar, chairman of the aviation
subcommittee, Trump said the perception that such legislation may
be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the United
Airlines takeover attempt and Friday's disruption in the financial
markets.
   Trump also said attempts to rush legislation through Congress
``cannot be in the interest of anyone but AMR executives.''
   Backers of the bill, however, said the legislation was not
written for AMR or any particular airline. Similar legislation has
already been approved by the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
   Despite strong support in the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee, the Bush administration opposes the bill,
according to a letter to Oberstar from Elaine L. Chao, deputy
secretary of transportation.
   She said the department already has sufficient authority to act
when an acquisition raises questions about an air carrier's fitness.
   Oberstar's bill would allow the Transportation Department to
block an airline takeover if the carrier would be financially
weakened and safety would deteriorate, if a major reduction in
assests would occur, or if control would go to a foreign interest.
The full committee is scheduled to vote on the bill either today or
Wednesday.
   ``There is a widespread feeling that leveraged buyouts ought to
be subject to review and some degree of regulation so they do not
jeopardize the potential for competition in the nation's air
transportation system,'' Oberstar, D-Minn., said.
   Due to recent mergers, the country's top eight airlines control
than 90 percent of domestic air traffic, Oberstar said.
   ``The traveling public cannot afford to have one of these
remaining major airlines dismantled or seriously disabled as an
effective competitor by the burden of servicing excessive debt
resulting from a leveraged buyout,'' Oberstar said, adding that
Congress and the government must be vigilant in ensuring safety
isn't compromised.
   Michael Kelliher, president of the Association of Professional
Flight Attendants, which represents the 15,000 American Airlines
flight attendants, said those employees have no desire to become
pawns in a corporate chess game.
   ``Our flight attendants would strongly object ... to working as
hard as we do to service inflated junk bond interest debt
accumulated for reasons contrary to keeping our airline healthy,''
he said.
   Also voicing support for the bill were representatives of the
Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Transport
Workers Union of America and the Association of Flight Attendants.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Banks Are Too Highly Leveraged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a
pitch for strong capital standards, told bankers at their annual
convention that banks like many other corporations today are highly
leveraged.
   Greenspan, addressing the American Bankers Association on
Monday, cited recent efforts by banks to build their capital, the
cushion that protects government insurance funds and by extension
the taxpayers from losses.
   But, he added, ``despite the progress many of you have made in
recent years ... capital levels for the industry remain at the low
end of their broad historical range.''
   ``Current levels (of 6.3 percent of assets) are one-sixth the
levels of the mid-1800s, and are less than one-half the level some
50 years ago,'' he said.
   In some ways, the trend for banks mirrors the trend for
corporations generally, which in recent years have taken on more
debt, keeping their equity ratios low.
   Greenspan pointedly refrained from commenting on the sharp
dispute dividing two other banking agencies _ the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
   Both agencies have agreed on a new risk-based capital standard
that gives banks a break for holding relatively safe investments
such as government securities and home mortgages. However, they
disagree over a second capital standard, called a leverage ratio,
meant to stop banks from sharply reducing their capital by
restructuring their holdings.
   The FDIC, which insures bank deposits, is pushing for a leverage
ratio of 4.5 percent, but the comptroller's office, an arm of the
Treasury Department which charters national banks, wants 3 percent.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the comptroller's proposal
would reduce standards for 90 percent of the nation's banks,
allowing the industry as a whole to hold $8 billion less of a
safety cushion. However, Comptroller Robert L. Clarke said
Seidman's proposal would dampen the features of the risk-based
standard designed to encourage banks to make safe investments.
   ``I do not wish to debate the details of which specific ratios
or standards are most appropriate to assess capital adequacy,''
Greenspan said. But ``it is important to keep in mind that, in both
relative and absolute terms, banking is a highly leveraged
industry.''
   He said bank owners have an incentive to minimize their capital
as a way of maximizing their stockholders' return. However, when a
financial institution holds inadequate capital, its owners do not
have the proper exposure to limit risky activity, he said.
   Moreover, the risks in banking today are arguably higher than
they were in the days when banks had higher capital ratios, the
chairman said.
   ``The number and size of failures we have seen in both the
banking and thrift industries demonstrate clearly that depository
institutions must maintain sound capital positions and be able to
deal with unexpected events,'' he said.
   Greenspan made only a brief reference to the turmoil in world
stock markets on Friday and Monday. Greenspan said the Fed had also
been in ``productive contact'' with foreign governments, but did
not elaborate on what actions the United States and other
governments were taking.

   Bankers at their annual convention noted the
increasing competition from credit unions and cried foul.
   A study released Monday by the American Bankers Association
concludes that credit unions, which as non-profit organizations are
tax-exempt, serve members who are economically better off than most
Americans.
   ``It is ironic that credit union members have higher incomes ...
yet banks are subject to federal income taxes,'' said Thomas P.
Rideout, outgoing president of the ABA and vice chairman of First
Union National Bank of North Carolina.
   The report, prepared by The Secura Group, a consulting firm
headed by former bank regulator William Issac, said 49 percent of
credit union members had annual incomes between $30,000 and
$80,000, compared with 32 percent of non-members in the U.S.
population.
   Moreover, by loosely interpreting membership requirements,
credit unions have grown from $69 billion in assets in 1980 to $196
billion at the end of last year, it said. Their membership reached
60 million this year (34 percent of all adults in the country), up
from 40 million 20 years ago.
   A spokeswoman for a credit union trade group, Susan Broaddus of
the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, denounced the
bankers' survey, saying credit unions ``are a whole different
animal'' from banks.
   ``They serve a wide spectrum of income levels. ... They're not
for profit. ... And they operate with a lot of volunteer support,''
she said. ``The whole (ABA) effort was not to get objective data on
credit unions, but an attempt to bolster their case.''
   The banking trade group has made the imposition of taxes on
credit unions one of the key parts in its fight to persuade
Congress to permit it to compete more effectively.
   But, at a panel discussion featuring members of Congress, the
bankers were told they were fighting an uphill battle against
credit unions, which can muster strong grassroots lobbying.
   ``If I wanted to tax credit unions, I would do so the day after
I announced by retirement,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va.

<HEAD>Trump Withdraws Offer for AMR, Cites Market Slide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump said he might consider a lower offer
for AMR Corp. after withdrawing his $7 billion bid for the parent
of American Airlines, but opponents approved a plan to give the
government power to block a buyout.
   The billionaire developer said he was pulling his $120-a-share
offer for the nation's largest airline because of the stock market
turmoil triggered in part by a buyout attempt for the nation's No.
2 airline.
   AMR stock plunged in heavy trading on the New York Stock
Exchange following word of Trump's withdrawal, finishing down
$22.12{ a share at $76.50.
   Union leaders and several congressmen have criticized the
takeover proposal, saying it would saddle AMR with such a heavy
debt it would be forced to sell assets and cut corners on safety.
   Before Trump announced his withdrawal, opponents testified
before a House subcommittee in support of a bill that would give
the Transportation Department up to 50 days to block the takeover
of at least 15 percent of the voting stock of a major air carrier.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn.,
approved the bill, which was to be taken up Wednesday by the full
House Public Works and Transportation Committee.
   A Senate committee already has approved a bill with similar
provisions, and many, including Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, had
indicated they would amend the bill to make it cover Trump's AMR
plans.
   Trump sent a letter to Oberstar on Monday accusing AMR
management of ``obvious self-interest'' in supporting the
legislation. He said attempts to rush legislation through Congress
``cannot be in the interest of anyone but AMR executives.''
   But Bentsen said, ``I think Mr. Trump has elected the wisest
course. Taking a solid airline like American and piling it up with
$6.5 billion worth of debt was ill-advised from the start. I hope
Trump's withdrawal is a full-scale retreat.''
   In a two-paragraph letter to AMR, Trump said, ``I am currently
reviewing all my options with respect to AMR, including making
another offer at a lower price, increasing my existing position in
AMR, selling my AMR stock or taking other actions that I may deem
appropriate.''
   Trump Organization officials said there would be no further
comment.
   AMR greeted the news with the same silence it has maintained
since Trump unveiled his bid for the nation's largest airline on
Oct. 5.
   But baggage and freight handlers said they would continue to
support the current management and oppose Trump.
   Trump's has a history of buying shares of companies, making
takeover noises and later selling his stock on the subsequent
speculation-related runup, or when a third party bidder emerged.
   Monday's slide in AMR stock continued a plunge that began last
Friday, when news that a management-employee group was unable to
obtain financing for its planned $6.75 billion buyout of United
Airlines parent UAL Corp. triggered the second-biggest one-day
point drop in stock market history.
   Analysts said Monday a second, lower offer by Trump might be
even more difficult.
   ``He supposedly has taken a look at the earnings power of this
corporation, and said it's worth $120'' a share, said Kevin Burke,
a transportation analyst at First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.
   David Pizzimenti, an analyst at Nomura Research
Institute-America, said a price lower than $120 a share ``would be
undervalued'' and an already reluctant AMR board would be unlikely
to accept anything less.

   Program traders were notably absent as the stock
and stock-index futures markets rebounded, experts said.
   But it wasn't for lack of opportunity, as Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index futures sometimes traded at wide variances to the underlying
cash index Monday, offering potential profits for those willing to
buy one and sell the other.
   Futures ended the session at a sizeable premium. The contract
for December delivery of the 500 stocks tracked by the S&amp;P 500
index settled 15.65 points higher at 344.50 on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while the cash index finished at 342.86.
   Traders and analysts speculated that program traders sat out the
session either out of caution or concern that their large-scale
trades might unnerve smaller investors.
   ``I would assume the firms that do program trading knew it was a
crucial day for people to have confidence in the market,'' said
William Finke, a vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago.
   John Legittino, vice president of Elders Futures Inc., guessed
that the computer traders were ``sitting on the sidelines to see
how the whole thing unfolds.''
   Stock-index futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of
stocks at specified prices by a specified date.
   Program trading employs computers to buy and sell huge blocks of
stocks and index futures in an attempt to profit from minute
differences in prices on the two markets. The practice can cause
rapid price swings and is believed by some to have accelerated the
stock-market collapse of Oct. 19, 1987.
   Traders and analysts attributed Monday's rally to a resurgence
of investor confidence following a 30-point plunge in the S&amp;P 500
futures on Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by
190 points.
   The Dow rallied by just over 88 points on Monday.
   In addition to the dearth of program trading, experts said
supportive factors included the encouraging performance of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange earlier Monday, where the main market
barometer fell by a modest 1.8 percent, and the stated
determination of British Airways PLC to continue with an
employee-management group to seek to buy United Airlines' parent
UAL Corp.
   Failure of the buyout group to arrange financing of the deal
helped trigger Friday's market plunge.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
sharply today and the dollar rallied as Monday's strong recovery on
Wall Street restored confidence in the financial markets.
   Other Asian stock markets also surged ahead today, apparently
reassured that a repeat of the global crash of 1987 wasn't in the
making.
   News that the Dow Jones industrial average rose by more than 88
points on Monday, reversing almost half of Friday's big 190-point
selloff, helped propel the Tokyo market to its second-biggest point
gain of the year.
   The Nikkei Stock Average jumped by 527.39 points, or 1.53
percent, to 34,996.08. The rally erased most of Monday's
647.33-point plunge.
   Traders said volume was a moderate 650 million shares, up from
Monday's thin total of 520 million shares.
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto praised coordination
between financial authorities of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations during the stock crisis. He also repeated
remarks he made Monday that he wasn't seriously concerned about the
impact of Friday's plunge in New York.
   ``I don't think markets moved that sharply,'' he said at a press
conference after a regular Cabinet meeting.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said one reason Friday's Wall Street plunge didn't lead
to another crash was because interest rates are lower today than
two years ago.
   ``The crash in New York (on Friday) was not linked to uneasiness
about funds, as was the crash of Black Monday,'' the dealer said,
referring to the record 508-point fall in the Dow industrials on
Oct. 19, 1987.
   But Haruhito Ichimura, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities, said it was too early to tell whether Wall Street had
recovered completely from its fall.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank, said there were
rumors Tuesday that Japanese banks again were backing away from a
revised plan for financing a buyout of United Airlines' parent
company, although they had little impact on share prices.
   The refusal of banks, many Japanese, to support the proposed
$6.75 billion buyout helped trigger last Friday's plunge on Wall
Street. A Citibank spokesman in Tokyo said the bank was presenting
a revised financing package for a bid of $250 a share, down from
$300 a share under the original plan, but United's pilots denied
there was any formal offer at the lower price.
   The U.S. dollar ended trading at 142.25 yen in Tokyo, up 1.50
yen from Monday. It moved within a range of 141.80 yen to 142.35
yen during the day.
   Elsewhere in Asia Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged
94.20 points to close at 2695.90, recovering some of the ground
lost Monday when it fell 6.5 percent.
   Indexes in Australia and New Zealand, which fell about 8 percent
on Monday, finished today with gains of 3.8 percent and 5.7
percent, respectively.
   Taiwan's stock index gained 410.32 points to close at 10,100.52.
It was the market's biggest one-day point gain ever and more than
erased Monday's decline of 329.48.
   ``The recovery on Wall Street relieves worries over a worldwide
crash and draws bargain-hunters,'' said one Taiwan broker, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Share prices rebounded in Thailand and the Philippines.

   Friday's 190-point drop had raised fears of a repeat of October,
1987, when a Friday decline turned into an Oct. 19, Monday rout
that knocked a record 508 points off the average. That did not turn
out to be the case this time.
   Stocks held up while the U.S. bond market fell steeply and
foreign stock markets showed widespread weakness.
   Stock indexes Monday fell 1.8 percent in Tokyo, 3.2 percent in
London and a steep 12.8 percent in Frankfurt, West Germany, where
one trader described trading as a ``blood bath.''
   The dollar's value tracked the stock market and was mixed
against major currencies.
   Traders said the stock market benefited from the experience
gained in the 1987 crash. The New York Stock Exchange managed to
handle the heavy trading volume because of a big investment in
technology made after the crash.
   In addition, traders were soothed by a promise over the weekend
by the Federal Reserve to supply fresh money to the financial
system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing to
traders who lost money.
   It turned out that little action by the Fed was necessary. As a
precaution, the central bank injected about $2 billion into the
financial system on a day when it ordinarily would have drained
reserves.
   Turmoil continued in the airline sector. Donald Trump announced
he was withdrawing his $7 billion bid for AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines, after the company's stock fell in the broad
market plunge. He said he would consider a new offer at a lower
price.
   It was a failure to obtain financing for an employee-management
buyout of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that sparked Friday's
plunge. A spokesman for British Airways PLC, which is backing the
buyout group, said the group still planned to pursue a takeover,
although the terms of the deal were under review.
   There were communications all day Monday between the stock
exchanges, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, New York Stock Exchange spokesman Richard Torrenzano
said.

   An unexpectedly poor U.S. trade report knocked
some buying enthusiasm out of the stock market this morning and
Wall Street got off to a weak start.
   But a barrage of sell orders in the opening minutes appeared to
be subsiding. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, off
more than 20 points in the first quarter hour of trading, was down
12.92 at 2,644.46 at 10 a.m. EDT.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 761 down, 330 up and 472
unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks was 1
point lower at 188.76.
   Much of today's initial selling was traced to news that the U.S.
trade deficit, after two straight monthly declines, rose to $10.77
billion in August. The Commerce Department said the August
shortfall represented nearly a 31 percent increase from the revised
July deficit of $8.24 billion.
   But market analysts also said stocks were vulnerable after
Monday's uneven recovery, which was concentrated mainly in the blue
chip sector.
   In the early going, blue chip issues again dominated the list of
actively traded NYSE stocks.
   Philip Morris lost 1 to 42\, International Business Machines
fell 1| to 101], American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped | to 42],
Chevron gained [ to 64 and General Electric was off ] to 56[.
   Ford Motor, which announced it has raised its stake in Jaguar to

   AMR, which tumbled Monday after investor Donald Trump said he
was withdrawing his $7 billion for the airline holding company,
lost another 2} to 73}.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average recouped almost half
of its Friday the 13th 190-point loss, jumping 88.12 to 2,657.38.
It was the fourth biggest point gain on record.
   NYSE volume totaled 416.29 million shares, the fourth heaviest
ever, and significantly more than the 251.17 million shares that
changed hands in Friday's selloff.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed shares by about 4 to 3,
with 975 stocks down in price, 749 up and 279 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index rebounded by 4.20 to 189.76.

   House and Senate Democratic leaders met today
to map out strategy for completing an emergency deficit-reduction
bill that would roll back automatic spending cuts mandated by the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   But the White House said it may no longer accept legislation to
reverse the arbitrary cutbacks, which slash more than $8 billion
each from defense and domestic programs to reduce the federal
deficit.
   ``There is some feeling here that (the automatic cuts) are the
way to go. It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion,''
said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman who announced
Monday night that President Bush had ordered the cuts as required
by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The White House and the Senate had pushed the House to accept
Monday their deal on a ``stripped-down'' deficit package, which
would have allowed Bush to avoid ordering the cuts.
   The House brushed aside that suggestion. Leaders of both parties
said they could not so easily jettison their version of the budget
bill, which included action on some of the year's most contentious
issues.
   In two weeks of sometimes furious debate, the House voted to cut
the capital gains tax, multiply federal aid for child care and
repeal the Medicare catastrophic illness plan _ along with a host
of other political favorites.
   ``We're not suddenly going to abandon them,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, met with House
Democratic leaders on the topic this morning. He said formal
negotiations between the two chambers could begin as early as this
afternoon.
   Panetta and Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., spent Monday
meeting with other House leaders. Panetta said they hope to develop
a plan this week to produce a House-Senate deficit reduction bill
and send the Senate a separate bill including the other issues
without forcing new House votes.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., the ranking Republican on the Budget
Committee, said GOP members wanted to make sure their favorite
measures in the old House bill retained their status.
   ``We are anxious to work with the Democrats to obviate the
need'' for the Gramm-Rudman cuts, he said. But Republicans, he
said, were ``a little less frantic.''
   The order signed by Bush Monday night cut 4.3 percent from
Pentagon programs and 5.3 percent from domestic agencies, except
for Social Security and poverty programs.
   The cuts would reduce the deficit for fiscal 1990 by $16.1
billion. They were required by the Gramm-Rudman law because
Congress and the president have not been able to agree on an
alternative way to cut the projected deficit below $110 billion.
   Although few immediate disruptions were expected in the short
term, the cuts could have widespread effects if not reversed.
Layoffs in the military, furloughs of air traffic controllers and
cancellation of thousands of student loans could be expected.
   Richard Darman, the president's budget director, also said he
thought sticking with the across-the-board cuts might be better
than accepting legislation to undo them.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said the deficit bill could have been in place weeks ago
except for the administration's ``obsession'' with attaching to it
the president's cherished capital gains tax cut.
   He said if the automatic cuts were to remain in place, it would
put ``a real torpedo in the side of education'' and other important
programs, such as defense and fighting illegal drugs, which Bush
supports.
   Darman's ``bellicose statements'' that he'd accept the cuts
amounted to ``a lot of breast-beating,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boeing, Machinists To Talk Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. has agreed to resume negotiations
with striking Machinists but called off talks with engineers
seeking a new labor contract because of ``grossly excessive''
pay-raise demands.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said the company and the Seattle
Professional Engineering Employees Association met Monday, the
first of two days of negotiations.
   ``The company has advised SPEEA that because of its unrealistic
and grossly excessive economic proposal,'' Boeing canceled a
meeting scheduled for today, Carr said Monday.
   The union, which represents 28,000 engineers and technical
support workers, said last week it was seeking pay raises of 19
percent in the first year and 8 percent in the second and third
years of a three-year contract. The current contract expires Dec. 1.
   Dan Mahoney, engineers' union spokesman, late Monday had no
comment on Boeing's action.
   Sepparately, Boeing agreed to return Wednesday to the bargaining
table with the Machinists. Federal mediator Doug Hammond said he
believes the time is right to resume talks.
   A strike by 57,800 members of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers enters its third week Wednesday.
   Carr refused to say if the company had improved its offer.
   ``We welcome a chance to see whether Boeing has re-evaluated its
position,'' union spokesman Matt Bates said.
   The Machinists walked out on Oct. 4. They voted 85 percent
against a new contract offer from the world's largest commercial
jet builder, which is enjoying its fifth straight year of
record-high orders.
   About 43,300 strikers are in the Seattle area, 12,000 in
Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore. and lesser numbers at a
half-dozen other locations.
   Boeing's three-year offer to the Machinists included wage hikes
of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of
gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause
almost matching inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and
increases in some benefits.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened dramatically to
$10.77 billion in August, the biggest imbalance in eight months,
the government said today in a report which sent stock prices
tumbling at the start of trading.
   The Commerce Department said the August shortfall between
imports and exports was 30.8 percent higher than a revised July
deficit of $8.24 billion.
   While analysts had been expecting the trade deficit to worsen in
August, the actual figure was much higher than a consensus forecast
for a deficit of around $9 billion.
   Unexpectedly bad trade reports have in times past sent shock
waves through financial markets, first causing the dollar to
plunge, with the weaker U.S. currency acting to pull down stock
prices as well.
   The dollar dipped in early trading and stock prices opened
sharply lower.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrial stocks plunged
24.59 at the opening, but the loss was cut to 12.50 within 30
minutes. Traders attributed the early sell-off to concerns that the
trade deficit was worsening and that could lead to higher interest
rates.
   The August deficit was the worst trade imbalance since a $10.80
billion deficit last December.
   The widening gap resulted from a 0.2 percent decline in exports
to $30.4 billion and a 6.4 percent increase in imports to $41.2
billion.
   ``This is of course an unwelcome increase and we're hopeful that
it simply is a one-month situation and will turn around,'' said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Asked if the administration feared the trade figures would drive
down the market, Fitzwater said, ``The market seems stable and the
economy is sound and there is no cause for disruption of that
kind.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the level of imports
was a record but was ``primarily due to higher purchases of capital
goods which are used to produce other goods. This increase supports
growing capacity in the manufacturing sector.''
   Mosbacher, noting the volatility of the monthly trade reports,
added that ``looking at the longer-run trends, we see that the
trade balance for the first eight months of 1989 of $73.1 billion
continues to be substantially below the total for the same period
last year of $78.8 billion, or $102.2 billion for the same period
in 1987.''
   ``While exports have increased by about 15 percent so far this
year and by 48 percent compared to the same period in 1987, we note
that exports remain high but growth has slowed in recent months,''
he said.
   The August deficit was the first increase since May.
   Economists had been watching to see what effect the rising value
of the dollar would have on the trade imbalance. A stronger dollar
tends to widen the trade gap by making U.S. goods more expensive
overseas while lowering the price of imports to American consumers.
   Rising imports tend to curb demand for U.S.-produced goods, thus
dampening production and threatening the loss of jobs.
   Exports, on the other hand, strengthen demand on domestic
production and help create more jobs.
   Preliminary estimates had put the deficit in August at about $9
billion.
   The nation's foreign oil bill increased 0.4 percent to $4.3
billion in August. The amount of imported oil rose to 8.67 million
barrels a day from 8.14 million in July, but the price per barrel
fell to $16.14 from $17.12.
   In addition to oil, increased imports included manufactured
goods such as electrical machinery, clothing and footwear.
   Analysts had said a big decrease in airplane and aircraft
exports would contribute to the widening of the August deficit.
Such exports were off 16.1 percent, the Commerce Department said.
   For the first eight months of the year, exports increased 14.6
percent while imports rose 18.7 percent.
   The deficit for the year on an annual rate was $109.7 billion.
The deficit totaled $118.5 billion in all of 1988.
   As usual, the largest trade deficit in August was with Japan, an
imbalance of $3.99 billion, down from $4 billion in July. The
deficit was $1.4 billion with Taiwan, $1.2 billion with Canada,
$700 million with South Korea and $600 million with China.
   The July trade gap of $8.24 billion was the slimmest since a
$6.79 billion imbalance in December 1984 and compared with a $8.01
billion deficit in June and a $10.1 billion deficit in May.

   An audit showed that Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association was in such poor condition that it warranted an
immediate crackdown more than three years before the government
seized the institution, a federal regulator said today.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said the March 12, 1986 audit by the San Francisco branch of
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that Lincoln had violated
rules limiting risky direct investments in commercial ventures, was
not in compliance with accounting standards, had substantial loan
losses, had inadequate and missing records and was speculating in
options trading.
   The FDIC, which insures bank and S&amp;L deposits, took control of
Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif., last April after S&amp;L regulators at the
bank board declared it insolvent.
   Seidman, in sworn testimony to the House Banking Committee,
estimated that the failure of Lincoln would eventually cost
taxpayers between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, making it the
costliest S&amp;L collapse in the nation's history.
   Had the FDIC been in charge of supervising Lincoln in 1986, it
would have moved to stop the abuses, Seidman said. ``My staff
indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own
institutions, we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist
order to stop the hazardous operations,'' he said.
   The FDIC, under orders from President Bush, began taking over
insolvent S&amp;Ls in February, removing them from the jurisdiction of
the now-defunct bank board, headed by M. Danny Wall.
   Since the Lincoln takeover, the government has filed a $1.1
billion fraud and racketeering suit against Phoenix millionaire
Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent, American
Continental Corp. It charges that Keating, his family and
associates diverted funds from Lincoln's depositors for their
personal use.
   A key question of the hearings is why the bank board under Wall,
after meeting with Keating, transferred the task of regulating
Lincoln to Washington from the agency's San Francisco office.
   The San Francisco-based regulators recommended in the spring of
1987 that Lincoln be seized. However, after Keating complained that
he was being treated unfairly, Wall ordered another examination by
regulators in Washington, delaying action against Lincoln until
this year.
   ``The sad fact about this failure is that the warning signs were
there and the stop signs posted in time to prevent much of the loss
to the insurance fund,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
Banking Committee chairman.
   ``But the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, instead, waved the
institution through the stop signals and let it continue racing
down the fast land until it crashed.''
   ``Institutions like Lincoln Savings and Loan should never be
allowed to poison our financial system,'' said Rep. Chalmers Wylie
of Ohio, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. ``Lincoln
was a rogue elephant. ... The fact that this institution was
federally insured is frightening.''
   Because of congressional protocol, the House committee is
unlikely to deeply explore the role of five senators who received
campaign contributions from Keating. Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn,
D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., met with regulators in
April 1987 to question them about Lincoln.
   DeConcini and Riegle have since returned the contributions, but
the self-styled citizens lobby Common Cause last week asked the
Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the matter.
   Last week, the banking panel voted to subpoena federal and
California regulators, private accountants and Keating himself.
Additional hearings are scheduled Oct. 24, Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.
Keating and Wall are not scheduled to appear until the last session.
   During the debate of the S&amp;L bill, Gonzalez had sought
unsuccessfully to force Wall to be reconfirmed by the Senate in his
new position as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, an
arm of the Treasury Department created to replace the bank board.
   However, as part of the compromise to get the legislation
enacted, Gonzalez dropped his objection to Wall, who was strongly
supported by Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the
Senate Banking Committee.

<HEAD>Ford Increases Stake in Jaguar to 10.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it raised its stake in
the luxury car maker Jaguar PLC to 10.4 percent from 5 percent.
   The U.S. auto maker said it held 19 million Jaguar shares at the
end trading Monday.
   The increase signals Ford's commitment to pursue the purchase of
up to 15 percent of Jaguar, possibly as the prelude to a full bid.
   Some analysts had speculated that Ford might withdraw its plans,
announced in mid-September, because of an expected production and
equity-sharing link between Jaguar and General Motors Corp.
   Jaguar is negotiating a deal with GM that would maintain the
British company's independence, and Jaguar has spurned Ford's
approaches.
   Under Jaguar's by-laws, Ford and other outside shareholders are
prohibited from acquiring more than 15 percent of the company until
the end of next year.
   The condition was imposed by the British government when it
privatized Jaguar in 1984.

<HEAD>Control Data Announces New Mainframe Computer, Tech-Sharing Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. on Tuesday
announced development of a mainframe computer it expects to begin
shipping in the second half of 1990.
   The Cyber 2000 is a $2.3 million machine that eventually will
replace its biggest mainframe, the Cyber 990. The new machine,
based on Control Data's own proprietary technology, will have twice
the computing power of its predecessors, the company said.
   The computer company also announced a technology-sharing
agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., to
design the brains of its future computers.
   The joint development agreement with MIPS means Control Data
will use a streamlined chip design known as Reduced Instruction Set
Computing, or RISC, developed by that firm. That is a departure
from using chips of the company's own design.
   As early as next year, Control Data expects to be selling
specialized computers based on the technology but it also will
conduct joint development of projects further in the future, said
E. J. Otis, senior vice president.
   ``As we move forward, RISC technology will pervade all CDC
projects,'' Otis said.
   RISC computer chips cannot carry out all the functions of more
general-purpose chips that have traditionally been the central
processors in computers. But they are faster and are gaining
acceptance for computers performing intensive numerical operations
or producing sophisticated graphics.
   The move by Control Data is related to the layoff of 95 research
and development people last week at Control Data's Arden Hills
facility. Because the company will rely on someone else to design
the central processing chips of future computers, it no longer
needs the employees who have been designing its own proprietary
chips.
   ``In agreeing to obtain that technology, Control Data is
recognizing that they can't do it all,'' said analyst Gary Smaby of
the Smaby Group in Minneapolis.
   As for the new mainframe computer, Smaby said, ``It keeps them
in the ball game. ... A lot of people out there had thought they
had fallen so far behind they couldn't get back in anymore.''

   Futures prices for soybeans and corn were mostly
higher and wheat prices mostly steady in early trading today on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans opened higher than expected due to new export demand
and rains in the central states that were slowing the crop's
harvest, analysts said.
   Corn prices were supported by export demands from South Korea,
China and Mexico, said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat was weakened by the U.S. Agriculture Department's
rejection of an Egyptian tender for 400,000 metric tons of the
commodity, he said.
   In early trading, corn was up { to 2{ cents, with the contract
for delivery in December at $2.38} a bushel; wheat was unchanged to
1\ cents higher, with December at $4.11 a bushel; oats were 2 to 2{

   Price variations were not available.
   On Monday, livestock and pork prices slipped lower.

   U.S. Treasury bonds made moderate price gains
today as the market once again rallied at the expense of an
unsteady stock market.
   Market analysts said a downturn in stock prices today, following
Monday's partial rebound from the sharp loss on Friday, sent many
investors and to the relative safety of bonds.
   ``The outlook seems to have worsened for stocks,'' said Robert
A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities Co.
International.
   At noon EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 27.87 at
2,629.51.
   The stock market was concerned, in part, over the release of a
government report today showing the nation's August trade deficit
widening to $10.77 billion from a revised July deficit of $8.24
billion.
   Bond investors weren't as worried, analysts said.
   ``Depsite the fact that the trade deficit was worse than people
had generally looked for, it gave evidence that production in the
U.S was sluggish and the economy of the U.S. is not strong at the
moment,'' explained Carol A. Stone, senior economist for Nomura
Securities Inc.
   Fanning that feeling about the economy, as well as hopes that
interest rates had room to decline, was another government report
today showing industrial production edging down 0.1 percent in
September, she said.
   By midday today in the secondary market for Treasury bonds, the
bellwether 30-year issue was up | point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face
amount. Its yield, which moves inversely from its price, fell to
7.91 percent from 7.97 percent.
   The closely watched issue fell around $17.50 on Monday, wiping
out nearly all of the huge gains from Friday's rally.
   Prices of short-term government issues were up around \ point,
intermediate maturities rose between \ point and ] point and
long-term issues rose between ] point and } point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, stood at 1,191.08, up 1.93.
   Meanwhile, yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.48
percent as the discount fell 10 basis points to 7.26 percent.
Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.77 percent as the discount fell
2 basis point to 7.39 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to
7.69 percent as the discount fell 14 basis points to 7.20 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8 11-16 percent, up from 8| percent late Monday.
   In corporate bond trading, highly rated issues gained ground.
Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total
return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five
years or longer, rose 0.39 to 337.04.
   High-yield ``junk'' bonds continued to improve from Friday, when
trading was at a near-standstill. Traders said prices of the more
widely traded issues ranged from { point down to { point up.
   But unlike the Treasury market, the junk market was moving in a
closer direction to stocks.
   ``They're tracking equities,'' said Robert Lupo, a managing
director Smith Barney, Upham &amp; Co. ``They seem to be married to
each other.''
   In the tax-exempt market, prices of municipal bonds were mixed,
traders said.

<HEAD>Firm Rocked by Market's Slide Gets Guarantees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two financial exchanges are among parties that
have agreed to help guarantee backing for an options trading firm
hit hard by Friday's stock market collapse, a spokesman for
Continental Bank's options unit said Tuesday.
   Under the rescue plan, most of the customer accounts of
Chicago-based Fossett Corp. are being transferred to First Options
of Chicago, the bank's option's unit, said First Options spokesman
Bill Murschel.
   The unit agreed over the weekend to acquire Fossett's customer
accounts in exchange for financial guarantees from the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and
Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp., Murschel said in a telephone
interview.
   About 200 Fossett accounts are being transferred to First
Options in a transaction expected to be completed Tuesday, he said.
   The clearing corporation, which is owned by the nation's options
markets, pledged $20 million, while the CBOE offered $8 million in
guarantees and the American Stock Exchange offered $4 million, the
Chicago Tribune reported in Tuesday's editions, citing sources it
did not identify.
   Stephen Fossett, the company's president, pledged about $18
million to the Continental operation for a total of $50 million.
   Fossett was not in his office and did not immediately return a
telephone message seeking comment on how much his firm lost last
Friday.
   But sources who asked not to be identified told The Associated
Press $50 million is the worst loss Fossett would face if the
market continues to slide.
   That loss would have had to appear to be likely for Fossett to
agree to the transfer, sources said, adding that it probably won't
be determined until the end of the week if the guarantees will be
needed.
   The transfer of accounts is not unusual, the sources said, but
the guarantees offered by the exchanges are unprecedented.
   ``If a given firm is experiencing troubles, and it was obvious
late Friday that this firm was experiencing troubles, the clearing
organization can step in and work with that firm ... and transfer
accounts of that firm to a healthy firm,'' said a source who asked
not to be identified.
   The Fossett firm processes and guarantees trades of close to 200
professional options traders known as market makers. There was
concern that the firm wouldn't be able to meet numerous demands for
cash to back losing options positions if Friday's market decline
spilled over into Monday.
   Murschel said the transfer of accounts was taking place despite
the market's imrpovement Monday.
   Under the agreement, assets of the firm and its president would
be used first, followed by those of the clearing corporation, the
CBOE and Amex.
   ``We felt it was very important that Fossett not be allowed to
liquidate,'' said Alger Chapman, CBOE chairman. ``So did the
Options Clearing Corp. and the American Stock Exchange.
   ``It was simply not in the market's interest to have to
liquidate a firm coming on the heels of Friday, when the market
dropped 190 points,'' Chapman said.
   ``It is the first time we have taken such a step, and hopefully
it will be the last,'' he said.
   Continental and its federal regulators wanted the guarantees to
limit the bank's exposure in the event of a continued market
collapse, the newspaper said.
   Again citing unidentified sources, the Tribune said Continental
was especially concerned about the potential damage because of its
own options troubles during the stock market crash two years ago.
   Heavy losses at that time saddled the bank unit with a $90
million loss.

<HEAD>Fed Pumps More Cash Into Banking System</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs, with top 2 grafs new to raise amount to lead.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

   The Federal Reserve, taking the lead in
handling the government's market rescue efforts, pumped an
additional $1.5 billion into the U.S. banking system today as the
stock market focused on an unexpectedly bad trade report.
   Banks will be able to use the new reserves to make loans,
including coming to the assistance of brokerage firms caught in a
cash squeeze because of the drop in stock prices.
   The new infusion of cash followed an increase of $2 billion in
reserves supplied by the central bank on Monday and came as the
stock market was tumbling in reaction to a surprisingly bad
economic report.
   The government said the merchandise trade deficit in August
widened dramatically to $10.77 billion, the worst deficit since
December of last year.
   The bad trade report triggered a sell-off on the stock market,
with the Dow Jones industrial average off almost 30 points at
mid-day as investors worried about more volatility in a market
which has plunged and surged over the previous two trading days.
   The fresh infusions of cash on the part of the Fed were an
effort by the central bank to back up its pledge to keep the Friday
the 13th stock market plunge from having a disastrous ripple effect
through the financial system.
   Some private economists have expressed worries that by pumping
up the U.S. money supply, the central bank was running the risk of
making inflation worse and weakening the value of the U.S. dollar.
But Fed officials discounted those fears and said they stood ready
to supply more money if needed to insulate the banking system from
the stock market turmoil.
   For its part, the Bush administration was playing down any
worries over the dollar or inflation, preferring to bask instead in
successfully keeping the market's 190-point plunge on Friday the
13th from becoming a rerun of 1987's Black Monday.
   Instead of another huge drop, the market rallied Monday to
regain nearly half of the losses suffered on Friday, leaving the
administration breathing a sigh of relief.
   ``Calm and cool has prevailed,'' said one Treasury official who
spoke after the markets closed on Monday.
   Many economists said they believed the Fed's $2 billion infusion
on Monday threatened the dollar's stability by driving down U.S.
interest rates.
   ``Reducing interest rates too much could bring the dollar
down,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Any
dollar slide would be the most dangerous prospect for financial
markets because of the heavy holdings by foreign investors of
dollar-based assets.''
   The Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady was in close consultation
throughout the weekend with officials at the Federal Reserve and
the Securities and Exchange Commission and officials from other
governments.
   Brady, who chaired a commission which investigated the 508-point
market drop two years ago, emphasized the need for the various
agencies to keep all sides informed on what everyone was doing and
avoid any hint of panic, officials said.
   Thus, at the opening of the market on Monday when stock prices
were still falling, Bush told reporters ``I am not worried'' and
stressed that government agencies were keeping close tabs on
developments.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who won plaudits for his handling
of the 1987 crash, gained more kudos for the latest episode. Over
the weekend, the Fed made it clear that it would flood the banking
system with as much cash as needed to make it easier for banks to
continue making loans to brokerage houses that may have suffered
heavy losses.
   Without the line of easy credit, brokerage firms could have been
forced to sell more stocks to replenish their cash supplies, thus
further depressing stock prices.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, who has been in office less than
week, said the safeguards installed after the October 1987 market
crash worked well on Monday, demonstrating ``the significant
improvements that have been made in trading systems over the past
two years.''
   But some in Congress were unconvinced, saying that the market
gyrations demonstrated the need for more government regulation of
securities trading.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said
his panel would call Brady to testify on Oct. 26 about what further
reforms were needed to dampen market volatility.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said he believed a ``super
regulator'' was needed to oversee the markets, one of the
recommendations not implemented from the Brady Commission report.
   ``Regardless of the triggering mechanism, it pretty much falls
in the same pattern,'' he said. ``There is an incident ... which
creates some short-term volatility, at which point computer-driven
program trading kicks in, which adds velocity to the marketplace,
which creates a second level of volatility _ panic.''

<HEAD>USDA Sees Programs Continuing, For Now, Under Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs after 10th graf, After deducting, to explain
total cutbacks will be nearly $1.2 billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department will be forced to
furlough some chicken inspectors and reduce loan services to
farmers if Congress fails to cancel spending cuts ordered by the
Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   The law, triggered on Monday, orders spending cuts totaling $16
billion in the 1990 fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.
   Dennis Kaplan, chief of USDA's budget control and analysis
division, said there is widespread belief ``Congress will pass some
kind of reconciliation'' measure soon that will make the
Gramm-Rudman mandatory cuts, or sequester, unnecessary.
   Meanwhile, he said in an interview, the department's programs
``are going to go on, basically, as they always have over the next
couple of weeks ... There'll be no real impact on programs'' during
that time.
   ``Even if we go through the sequester, you're not going to see
any major impact until toward the end of the year,'' Kaplan said.
   Some USDA agencies with big payrolls would be hit hard
eventually. The Food Safety and Inspection Service, for example,
which handles federal meat and poultry inspection, ``will probably
furlough a lot of their employees,'' he said. ``But that won't
occur until August or September.''
   Other agencies in a similar boat include the Forest Service,
with its vast organization of regional and lower-echelon offices;
the Farmers Home Administration, including county offices that
service loans for financially pressed farmers; and the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, including its quarantine and
disease-control activities.
   Kaplan said much of USDA's spending is exempted from
Gramm-Rudman cuts, including the vast food stamp, school lunch and
other child nutrition programs.
   Farm price support operations are subject to the Gramm-Rudman
cutback, which averages 5.3 percent for domestic agencies, or about
$8.1 billion. Defense cuts also must total $8.1 billion, or 4.3
percent.
   After deducting all the exempted programs from USDA's projected
spending for the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, the base used
for the cuts is about $9.59 billion, Kaplan said. The 5.3 percent
Gramm-Rudman reduction would amount to around $509 million.
   In addition, a large bloc of price support spending by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp. for 1990 crops will actually be
made in fiscal 1991. However, Kaplan said that under Gramm-Rudman
rules this CCC expenditure will be counted as part of the 1990
cutback.
   Thus, the total Gramm-Rudman sequester will be nearly $1.2
billion, including the CCC reductions, which will carry into 1991.
   Two years ago, in another Gramm-Rudman round that was later
rolled back by Congress, USDA underwent an 8.5 percent pruning of a
base exceeding $8.25 billion, meaning a reduction of around $702
million.
   One of the first significant impacts on farm programs would
affect dairy farmers.
   Under the dairy price support program, the department's
Commodity Credit Corp. buys cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk to
support the price of milk paid to farmers by dealers. These
purchase prices will be reduced if Gramm-Rudman remains in effect,
although the USDA has not decided by how much.
   Kaplan said decisions on how to apply Gramm-Rudman cuts to crop
price support programs, including target prices, are ``still a long
way off.''
   Another factor in the operation of USDA agencies will be
scheduled pay raises of 3.6 percent that will have to be absorbed,
he said. All told, those raises will cost the department about $148
million.
   For example, the Food Safety and Inspection Service will have a
Gramm-Rudman spending cut of about $22 million. The agency's pay
raises in January will cost around $15 million.
   If Congress appropriates about the same amount as for 1988-89,
that means the agency will have to come up with about $37 million
out of the same total budget that it had the previous year in order
to meet Gramm-Rudman and pay raise requirements.
   Kaplan said the $37 million will be equal to nearly 9 percent of
the agency's spending budget planned for this fiscal year _ in
effect a 9 percent cutback instead of only a $5.3 percent
reduction. And that would chew into services the agency is expected
to provide.

<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second
largest long-distance telephone company, Tuesday reported nearly a
60 percent gain in third-quarter earnings on 23 percent revenue
growth.
   Income in the quarter ended Sept. 30 came to $165 million, or 62
cents a share, compared to $104 million, or 38 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $1.67 billion from $1.36 billion in 1988's third
quarter.
   MCI reported that the volume of residential calls increased
faster than business volumes, due largely to the introduction of a
new PrimeTime calling plan and expansion of operator and pay
telephone services.
   During the quarter, the Washington-based company announced
several major commercial contracts to provide telecommunications
services, including a deal with Congress.
   ``The company continued to garner a greater share of the
business market, and is making new inroads into the $23 billion
consumer market,'' said Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI president and
chief operating officer.
   For the first nine months of this year, MCI's after-tax earnings
more than doubled to $450 million, or $1.69 a share, from $224
million, or 78 cents a share, in the corresponding 1988 period.
   Revenue rose about 28 percent to $4.76 billion from $3.71
billion for the first nine months of last year.

   GTE Corp. on Tuesday said its
third-quarter income spurted 18 percent, reflecting greater use of
its local telephone networks and strong growth in its
celluar-telephone operations.
   The company said after-tax earnings in the three months ended
Sept. 30 reached a quarterly record of $368 million, or $1.06 per
share, up from $313 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose about 9 percent to $4.4 billion from $4 billion in
the comparable period a year ago.
   ``GTE's record earnings are particularly noteworthy in light of
the regulatory and competitive pressures affecting our
businesses,'' said James L. Johson, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   ``Fueled by increased usage of our local-telephone networks
along with very strong growth in our cellular-telephone operations
and solid performance in our other businesses, the trends in
earnings per share and return on equity continue to be positive,''
he said.
   For the first nine months of this year, GTE earned $1 billion,
about a 14 percent jump from the prior year's $898 million.
Earnings per share were $3.01 vs. $2.62.
   Revenue in the first three quarters of 1989 rose about 5 percent
to $12.8 billion from $12.2 billion.

   The stock market remained down sharply this
afternoon and airline shares continued to have a rough ride.
   Blue chips appeared to be steadying at lower levels in the
absence of any large-scale buying or selling waves.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 25.21 at
2,632.17 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Earlier, the average briefly
dipped below 2,600, depressed by futures-related computerized sell
programs, but bounced back up a bit when buy programs reappeared.
   Declining issues maintained a wide lead over advances on the New
York Stock Exchang _ of about 2 to 1 _ with 1,002 down, 517 up and
423 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks was
1.41 points lower at 188.35.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 174.21 million shares with 2
hours left to go.
   Part of today's weakness was attributed to profit-taking.
Investors were selling to collect profits made during the previous
session's rally in blue chip stocks that pushed the Dow Jones
industrial average up more than 88 points.
   Market analysts said stocks were vulnerable to any disappointing
news after Monday's uneven recovery, which was concentrated mainly
in the blue chip sector. That made report of an unexpectedly big
U.S. trade deficit particularly unwelcome.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit, after improving
for two months in a row, rose to $10.77 billion in August. The
August shortfall represented nearly a 31 percent increase from the
revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.
   UAL, which tumbled more than 56 on Monday, dropped another 19{
to 203]. There were doubts on Wall Street that an
employee-management group would be able to obtain the money they
need to buy the parent of United Airlines.
   AMR, which tumbled Monday after investor Donald Trump said he
was withdrawing his $7 billion for the airline holding company,
lost another 2} to 73}.
   The Dow Jones average of 20 transportation stocks fell 44.63 to
1,259.60, hurt by the selloff in UAL.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Down, Gold Mixed ^Eds: Ams version planned by 5:30

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Tuesday against most major
currencies in European trading after the release of an unexpectedly
high U.S. trade deficit for August.
   Gold prices were mixed in sluggish trading.
   Dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow range before dropping
on news that the U.S. trade deficit widened in August to $10.77
billion. Traders had expected a deficit around $9.5 billion.
   A rising deficit suggests the dollar is too expensive, making
American goods less competitive in foreign markets and making
foreign goods cheaper in the United States.
   Dealers said the dollar perked up after the release of slightly
better-than-expected U.S. industrial production and capacity
utilization figures.
   ``It shows that even a bad figure can't depress the market, for
there is enough interest in buying the dollar when it's cheap,''
said one dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   Dealers said it was difficult to predict the dollar's movements
over the rest of the week, because the market is still nervous
about volatility in U.S. stock prices.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.50 Japanese yen to a closing 142.25
yen from 140.75 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it edged
up further to 142.35 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5835 from $1.5820 late
Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe vs. late Monday: 1.8520 West
German marks, down from 1.8650; 1.6227 Swiss francs, down from
1.6345; 6.2960 French francs, down from 6.3365; 2.0867 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0805; 1,365.00 Italian lire, down from
1,372.50; 1.1755 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1765.
   Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $367.75 a
troy ounce, up from $366.50 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $366.90 from $367
bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 42 cents to close at a bid
$366.66.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.12 a
troy ounce from $5.11 bid late Monday.

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc., helped by a strong
performance in its space and aviation division, Tuesday reported
third-quarter earnings of $74.4 million compared with a $41.4
million loss a year earlier.
   But sales sagged to $1.726 billion from $1.729 billion.
   Last year's third-quarter results included a pre-tax charge of
$108 million related to unrecoverable contract costs, which was
partially offset by a pre-tax real estate gain of $12.3 million.
   Earnings per share of $1.73 for the three months ended Oct. 1,
compared with a per-share loss of 98 cents in the comparable 1988
quarter.
   Nine-month net income was $212.1 million, compared with $47.9
million in the corresponding 1988 period. Nine-month earnings per
share were $4.92, compared with $1.13 last year.
   Sales for the first nine months of 1989 were $5.17 billion, off
about 0.8 percent from $5.22 billion in 1988.
   Nine-month 1988 figures included pre-tax charges related to
unrecoverable contract costs and a discontinued product line of
$177 million and real estate gains of $27.2 million, Honeywell said.
   Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James J. Renier
said Space and Aviation Systems operating profit increased
significantly in the third quarter, reflecting continued strong
performance in commercial flight systems and recovery in military
avionics systems.
   Home and Building Automation and Control operating profit also
was up strongly, reflecting strength in building services and
continued satisfactory performance in a difficult new-construction
market, he said.
   Honeywell said it expects to complete the sale next week of
approximately 16 percent of the outstanding common stock of its
Tokyo-based partner, Yamatake-Honeywell, for approximately $280
million.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used in the company's previously
announced program to repurchase up to 10 million of its shares.

<HEAD>Company in the Spotlight After Monday Night Football Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND ISLAND, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The telephone was ringing off the hook
Tuesday at a company that specializes in belly dancers and ``exotic
apes,'' courtesy of some unexpected advertising on Monday Night
Football.
   The ABC telecast pitting the Los Angeles Rams and Buffalo Bills
showed a classified ad placed last week in the Buffalo News
designed to recharge the Bills' sluggish defense.
   But the camera shot also took in the ad that appeared just above
it in the News: ``BELLY &amp; hula dancers, exotic apes, male dancers,
773-2433.''
   ABC announcers Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf joked about the
belly dancers and emphasized they weren't advising people to call
the number. That, of course, caught the attention of a nationwide
audience looking for some thrills during what had been a dull game
up to that point.
   As of Tuesday, at least 75 people phoned the Showbiz
Entertainment Service run by Nick and Marlene Sidoti out of their
home in Grand Island, located just north of Buffalo.
   ``For a $4 ad, I got myself $75,000 or $100,000 worth of
advertising,'' Sidoti said. ``Thank you, ABC.''
   From Connecticut to California, from West Virginia to Utah, fans
decided to have a little fun _ by ordering out for a hula dancer.
   ``They were asking if we could send entertainment over for
halftime,'' Sidoti said. ``One guy said, `Why did you put the ad
on? Why didn't you just put the belly dancers on?'''
   Some callers asked about a job as a dancer. Some businessmen
called to ask how the Sidotis had arranged the nationwide
publicity. And some callers were just grateful.
   ``One lady from South Carolina said, `It was very nice of you to
sponsor the game, so I can see it on TV.'''
   Asked on Tuesday why the ad seemed to catch people's fancy,
Sidoti told the Buffalo News, ``People sit down, watch TV, get all
psyched and they get crazy. So there is a whole market out there.
There's definitely a captive audience.''

   Futures prices for soybeans and corn climbed
while wheat prices mostly steadied at the close Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``The main story was soybeans where there were strong rumors
that the Soviets are in the market for beans and meal, and a fairly
large quantity,'' said Ted Mao, a grains analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Soybeans contracts for delivery this winter gained 10 cents
during the session.
   Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., also
attributed the increase in soybean prices to rain in harvest areas
of central states.
   Corn was supported by China's purchase of corn, Mao said.
   Traders were talking about the possibility that the Chinese
could be buying as much as 500,000 metric tons. They purchased
150,000 metric tons of corn on Monday.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 1} cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.09 a bushel; corn was } to
2\ cents higher, with December at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were 1 to 2

   PepsiCo Inc. said Tuesday that third-quarter
profit rose 11.5 percent, reflecting advances in the company's soft
drink, snack food and restaurant businesses.
   The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said earnings rose to a record
for any quarter of $269.3 million, or $1.02 per share, in the three
months ended Sept. 9 compared with $241.6 million, or 91 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $3.90 billion from $3.13 billion a
year earlier.
   The 1988 figures included an after-tax loss of $5.9 million on
the sale of a winery in Spain.
   In the latest quarter, operating profit in the soft drink
business rose 36 percent to $205.7 million on a 26 percent sales
increase to $1.55 billion.
   Excluding the loss on the winery sales and the impact of recent
acquisitions and sales in the domestic soft drink business,
operating profits were up 12 percent, PepsiCo said.
   Improvement in domestic operating margins and higher prices
offset a decline in international results that reflected
acceleration of concentrate shipments and higher marketing spending.
   Operating profit from snack foods including Frito-Lay products
rose 30 percent to $211 million while sales rose 27 percent to
$1.06 billion in the quarter.
   The results included strong worldwide volume gains and
continuing margin improvements as well as the acquisition in July
of Smiths and Walkers, two leading snack chip companies in the
United Kingdom.
   Worldwide earnings from restaurant operations rose 25 percent to
$139.1 million while sales rose 22 percent to almost $1.3 billion
in the quarter.
   Operating earnings jumped 33 percent to $62.2 million at Pizza
Hut and 50 percent to $40.5 million at Taco Bell, but fell 4
percent to $36.4 million at Kentucky Fried Chicken, where a strong
international performance was offset by a decline in domestic
operations due to lower customer counts, higher labor costs and
higher chicken prices.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, PepsiCo said it
earned $699.3 million, or $2.64 a share, up 21.7 percent from
$574.5 million, or $2.18 a share, a year ago.
   Nine-month revenue rose 22.8 percent to $10.45 billion from
$8.51 billion a year earlier.
   The 1989 results included an after-tax net credit of $15.0
million stemming mainly from a decision to retain a foreign
bottling operation once held for sale, while the 1988 results
reflected an after-tax charge of $16.3 million for reorganizing
domestic soft drink operations and the winery loss.

<TEXT>
   McGraw-Hill Inc. reported Tuesday that third-quarter earnings
gained 9 percent from a year ago, while another large media
company, E.W. Scripps Co., said quarterly earnings jumped 35
percent.
   Park Communications Inc., a smaller communications concern based
in Ithaca, New York, said earnings fell 2 percent in the third
quarter.
   New York-based McGraw-Hill's earnings for the three months ended
Sept. 30 totaled $64.11 million or $1.31 a share, compared with
earnings of $58.75 million or $1.21 per share in 1988. Revenue rose
8.5 percent to $452.18 million from $416.69 million.
   Scripps, based in Cincinnati, said it earned $18 million or 23
cents a share in the third quarter on revenue of $304.25 million.
That compared with earnings of $13.4 million, or 17 cents a share
on revenue of $293.24 million.
   Park said quarterly earnings totaled $3.86 million, down from
$3.95 million a year earlier. Earnings per share remained at 19
cents, reflecting the impact of a 3-for-2 stock split. Revenue
totaled $39.26 million, up from $39.11 million.
   McGraw-Hill Chairman Joseph L. Dionne said the company had
growth in its publishing division, partly because of a solid
performance by its weekly magazine Business Week, and its financial
services companies. However, he said the information services
division showed a slight decline.
   For the first nine months of this year, McGraw-Hill earned
$146.05 million or $2.99 a share on $1.27 billion in revenue. Last
year earnings totaled $130.53 million or $2.69 a share on $1.19
billion in revenue.
   Scripps President Lawrence A. Leser said the company had strong
improvement in its publishing segment but that broadcasting results
came under pressure from weak advertising.
   In the first three quarters, Scripps' earnings totaled $58.3
million or 74 cents a share, vs. $47.6 million or 64 cents a share
a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.7 percent to $920.05 million from
$878.74 million.
   Roy Park, Park Communications' chairman, said broadcast revenue
for the third quarter was flat, while newspaper revenue rose
slightly.
   For the first nine months, Park Communications' earnings fell to
$12.54 million from $12.70 million. Earnings per share were 61
cents, the same as in 1988. Revenue was $119 million, up $1.7
million over 1988.

<HEAD>Market Frenzy Might Cramp LBOs and Junk Bonds in Europe, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest world stock market turmoil might cramp
the European trend toward U.S.-style leveraged buyouts and
junk-bond financing, which already is threatened by high interest
rates and economic worries, experts said Tuesday.
   Wall Street's near-record Friday the 13th plunge and subsequent
gyrations in stock markets worldwide was sparked by the failure of
a management-employee group to get financing for its planned $6.75
billion buyout of United Airlines.
   Nervousness about further market volatility might make it harder
for European bidders to raise funds for debt-financed deals.
Would-be buyers also are likely to scrutinize the profitability and
breakup value of their targets much more closely, the experts said.
   Market gyrations also could exacerbate anti-buyout, anti-junk
bond sentiment in Europe, where there is widespread ambivalence
about the import of these American takeover techniques.
   ``Human nature being what it is, when there a fright in the
market people immediately begin to question whether they ought to
be doing what they're doing,'' said Bruce Classon, managing
director of corporate finance at Bankers Trust Co. in London.
   ``European banks and even American banks will be more cautious
than in the past,'' said Roger Brooke, chief executive of Candover
Investments, a London-based buyout firm.
   Big, highly leveraged deals are raising controversy.
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith's $21 billion
all-securities bid for the British conglomerate BAT Industries PLC
has prompted a storm of protests in Britain.
   In a leveraged buyout, or LBO, a bidder borrows funds to take
over a company, then uses that company's profits or sells its
assets to pay off the debt.
   Such deals frequently are financed with the high-yield,
high-risk debt securities called junk bonds. Junk bonds are so
named because of their low credit ratings, which means they have a
considered to have greater default risk than higher-rated bonds.
   A slowdown in such deals could further deflate the London stock
market, which recently has gotten some support from takeover
speculation.
   Cheaper share prices resulting from the market downturn could
spur cash buyout bids, although not to the extent seen after the
October 1987 stock market crash, experts said.
   ``Investors and bankers are looking at economic prospects more
cautiously around the world,'' said Guy Dawson, head of corporate
finance at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC.
   ``You will see a slowdown in the market,'' Dawson said. ``Either
you will see fewer buyouts or they will be done at lower prices.''
   But he added, ``I don't think it spells the end of the LBO
market at all.''
   Bidders turned their attention to London and the rest of Europe
as a potential LBO market because competition among buyout houses
in the United States has reduced yields of such deals there.
   But higher interest rates in Europe have been making it more
expensive to finance buyouts. In Britain, Europe's biggest takeover
market, interest rates are 15 percent, an eight-year high, partly
due to government attempts to curb inflation.
   Also working against LBOs are concerns about corporate
profitability in a climate of slowing economic growth and higher
inflation, particularly in Britain.
   Critics say companies with heavy debts can go bust when interest
rates rise and also have less leeway to spend money on research and
development.
   Europeans also are biased against buyouts because they fear they
will cause job losses, worsening the Continent's relatively high
unemployment.
   Matthias Graeper, a consultant in the Hamburg office of the
British buyout firm Schroder Ventures Manager Ltd., said: ``There
are some bad feelings about junk bonds and the purchase prices of
some companies in the United States but I think we can avoid the
mistakes in Germany.''

   Most of Europe's stock markets partly recovered
Tuesday in a seesaw session, but the key London market fell and
nervousness about Wall Street's behavior persisted.
   Frankfurt, which suffered a record drop Monday, saw big gains in
urgent buying. Market indexes also finished higher in Paris,
Amsterdam, Milan, Zurich, Madrid, Athens, Vienna, Stockholm and
Oslo.
   The upward and downward moves were much less dramatic than
Monday's gyrations, which followed Wall Street's Friday the 13th
slump.
   Trading disruptions continued in Europe Tuesday. The Brussels
exchange had computer problems for a second day, preventing
significant trading since Friday.
   ``Once the confidence of the small investors has been hurt, it
will be difficult to return to a sustained upward trend,'' said
Jens Wiecking, institutional adviser at the Duesseldorf investment
firm Merck, Finck and Co.
   In the morning, European stock prices followed Tokyo's climb on
relief over New York's relatively strong finish Monday, which
suggested that an all-out crash appeared to have been averted.
   Earlier in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed 527.39 points,
or 1.3 percent, higher at 34,996.08, recouping most of the 1.8
percent lost on Monday.
   But European share prices fell in the afternoon on
worse-than-expected U.S. trade figures and on a subsequent weak
opening on Wall Street.
   The U.S. trade deficit rose to $10.77 billion, compared with
market expectations of around $9.1 billion.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell 27.9 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,135.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 29.6 points lower at
1,730.7. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 8.63 points to
close at 1,181.74.
   Volume totaled 643.4 million shares Tuesday vs. 959.3 million
shares Monday.
   The London session was jittery with the key index swinging 61.5
points from a session high of 2,182.3 in the first 15 minutes of
official dealings to a low of 2,120.8 in the last 40 minutes of
trading.
   But that was less dramatic than Monday, when the London index
fell more than 200 points and then mostly recovered to finish with
a 70.5 point decline.
   Dealers said London was buffeted throughout the session by
crosscurrents from Wall Street and fears about the U.S. trade
figures.
   ``Our market is behaving like a puppet on a string,'' said a
senior dealer at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. ``All markets are, and
Wall Street is controlling the strings.''
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 27.87 points, or 1
percent, at 2,629.51 at about the time London closed.
   The Dow Jones industrial average bounced back 88 points Monday
after its 190-point plunge on Friday.
   ``Everyone is still very nervous about the down side,'' said a
dealer with the London investment firm UBS Phillips and Drew.
``Also buyers who passed up bargains Monday decided to hold off
today to see if they'd come back later in the week.''
   The German Stock Index (DAX), which had plunged 12.8 percent in
its worst one-day drop ever Monday, soared 89.72 points, or 6.4
percent, to 1,475.44.
   Frankfurt's trading volume even surpassed Monday's frenzied pace
as small retail investors rushed to buy back some of the stocks
they had dumped, and institutional funds exploited lower prices to
boost their holdings.
   But the early enthusiasm soon gave way to a more sober
assessment and profit-taking late in the session, which was
extended by one hour to process all the orders.
   The Madrid Stock Market's General index rose 5.96 points, or 2
percent, to a close at 311.18. The index fell 6.5 percent Monday.
   In Zurich, the Swiss Market Index rose 82.3 points, or 5.1
percent, to 1,705.2. It declined 10.5 percent in the previous
session.
   The Athens Stock Exchange General Index rose 42.65 points, or
9.4 percent, to 497.79. It dropped 10.05 percent on Monday.

   Stocks retreated today following two of the
wildest sessions on Wall Street since the October 1987 market crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 18.65 points
to 2,638.73 after spiking down as much as 63 points around 11:30
a.m. Broader market indicators also fell.
   The Dow average had plummeted 190.58 points on Friday and
bounced back with an 88.12-point gain on Monday, leaving investors
groping for stable ground.
   The Commerce Department handed the market some bad news today
with its report that the merchandise trade deficit rose nearly 31
percent in August to $10.77 billion from a revised July deficit of
$8.24 billion.
   But analysts did not all agree that the big trade deficit was a
major factor in today's stock decline. Some noted that bonds and
the dollar _ which are most sensitive to bad trade figures _ held
up relatively well.
   The dollar recovered after a sharp drop that followed the trade
report, while bonds were mixed _ an indication that investors were
not seriously worried about worsening inflation and higher interest
rates.
   The Federal Reserve injected another $1.5 billion into the
banking system today after adding $2 billion in reserves on Monday.
   Banks will be able to use the new reserves to make loans,
including coming to the assistance of brokerage firms caught in a
cash squeeze because of the drop in stock prices.
   The Fed adds reserves by repurchasing Treasury securities from
the banks, and that puts fresh cash in the banks' hands.
   Stocks remain somewhat unstable after the drastic moves of the
past two sessions, some analysts said.
   ``There's much more going on in the stock market at the moment
than the trade numbers,'' said Lawrence A. Veit, international
economist at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   ``You'll tend to see somewhat accentuated volatility this week
and next,'' said Giulio Martini, economist at Sanford C. Bernstein
&amp; Co.
   Monday's gain was concentrated in blue-chip stocks, which
benefited from a ``flight to quality'' by nervous investors. It
came on trading volume of 416.29 million shares, the heaviest ever
except for the week of the 1987 market crash. The index's gain was
the fourth-biggest point gain, although it was not among the
biggest percentage gainers.
   Many economists had expected the latest trade deficit to be
about $9 billion, and Veit said he believed the sharp rise could
turn out to be a statistical freak.
   Traders were worried about the outlook for the
employee-management buyout proposal for UAL Corp. The stock fell
another $25.67{ a share to $197.25 after tumbling about $57 a share
Monday, and that contributed to the overall market weakness.
   In the overall New York Stock Exchange today, declining issues
outpaced advances by almost 3 to 2. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange totaled a heavier-than-usual 224.07 million shares, with
the heaviest action in the early going.
   Stocks rallied in Tokyo in response to Wall Street's strength of
Monday, but London's market lost ground in sympathy with today's
weakness on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In Tokyo, where Tuesday trading ended before New York opened for
business, the Nikkei Stock Average jumped by 527.39 points, or 1.5
percent, to 34,996.08 today. The gain was the second biggest on the
Japanese market this year and erased most of Monday's 647.33-point
decline.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
fell 27.9 points, or more than 1 percent, to close at 2,135.5.
   In New York on Monday, declining issues outnumbered advancing
ones by a 5-4 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Indexes of the
American Stock Exchange and over-the-counter stocks fell, while the
New York Stock Exchange composite index and Wilshire Equity Index
rose.
   Friday's 190-point drop had raised fears of a repeat of October,
1987, when a Friday decline turned into an Oct. 19, Monday rout
that knocked a record 508 points off the average. That did not turn
out to be the case this time.
   Traders said the stock market benefited Monday from the
experience gained in the 1987 crash. The New York Stock Exchange
managed to handle the heavy trading volume because of a big
investment in technology made after the crash.
   In addition, traders were soothed by a promise over the weekend
by the Federal Reserve to supply fresh money to the financial
system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing to
traders who lost money.

   Stocks pulled back today as Monday's blue-chip
rally faltered and the broader market couldn't overcome the impact
of another selloff in airline issues.
   Part of today's weakness was attributed to profit-taking.
Investors sold to collect profits made during the previous
session's strong blue chip performance that allowed the Dow Jones
industrial average to bounce back by more than 88 points from
Friday's 190-point dive.
   Market analysts said stocks were vulnerable to any disappointing
news after Monday's uneven recovery. That made report of an
unexpectedly big U.S. trade deficit particularly unwelcome.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit, after improving
for two months in a row, rose to $10.77 billion in August. The
August shortfall represented nearly a 31 percent increase from the
revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.
   A downturn in the airline sector hurt the Dow Jones average of
20 transportation stocks for the second day running. It plunged
49.96 to 1,254.27.
   UAL, which tumbled more than 56 on Monday, dropped another 25|
to 197\. Doubts persisted about whether an employee-management
group would be able to obtain the money they need to buy the parent
of United Airlines.
   AMR, which skidded Monday after investor Donald Trump said he
was withdrawing his $7 billion for the airline holding company,
lost 3\ to 73\.

   Stocks seesawed to a lower close Tuesday and
airline issues had another rough ride.
   Computer-driven program trades periodically rocked the market,
causing the third straight volatile session on Wall Street. Trading
was heavy but well below Monday's huge volume.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended the day down 18.65
points at 2,638.73.
   The drop was partly due to profit-taking. Investors sold to
collect profits amassed during the previous session's blue-chip
rally that helped the Dow Jones industrial average bounce back by
more than 88 points from Friday's 190-point dive.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
931 down, 658 up and 413 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 224.07 million
shares, down from 416.29 million on Monday, the fourth highest
total on record.
   Market analysts said stocks were vulnerable to any disappointing
news after Monday's uneven recovery. That made report of an
unexpectedly big U.S. trade deficit particularly unwelcome.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit, after improving
for two months in a row, rose to $10.77 billion in August. The
August shortfall represented nearly a 31 percent increase from the
revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.
   A downturn in the airline sector battered the Dow Jones average
of 20 transportation stocks. It plummeted 49.96 points to 1,254.27,
after losing more than 102 points on Monday for the largest
point-loss since the Black Monday crash two years ago.
   UAL skidded another 24~ to 198, adding to Monday's massive
56-point slide. Doubts persisted about whether an
employee-management group would be able to obtain the money they
need to buy the parent of United Airlines.
   AMR fell 3\ to 73\ after tumbling 22[ Monday on word Donald
Trump was withdrawing his $7 billion for the airline holding
company. AMR was second on the Big Board's list of actively traded
issues and more than 3.4 million shares changed hands.
   Philip Morris finished unchanged at 43\ and headed the actives'
list on volume of 3.9 million shares.
   Other actively traded blue chips included: International
Business Machines, down } to 102\; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
down } to 42\; Chevron, up [ to 64; Eastman Kodak, down } to 44\;
General Electric, unchanged at 56{; and USX, down ] to 33~.
   Ford Motor, which announced it has raised its stake in Jaguar to
10.4 percent from 5 percent, fell ~ to 49~.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 256.67 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $15.19 billion, or 0.45
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
declined 0.87 to 188.89.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index declined 1.99 to 389.34, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index ended at 341.16, off 1.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market went
down 1.05 to 459.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 375.16, down 1.25.

   The dollar recovered from an early loss Tuesday
and finished mixed in U.S. trading after falling against most major
currencies in trading in Europe on news of a bigger-than-expected
U.S. trade deficit.
   Gold prices edged higher in New York after a mixed showing
overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for
gold of $366.40 a troy ounce, up 60 cents from Monday's late bid.
   The dollar dropped early in the day on news that the U.S. trade
deficit widened in August to $10.77 billion when many traders were
expecting a deficit of about $9.5 billion.
   A rising deficit suggests the dollar is too expensive, making
American goods less competitive in foreign markets and making
foreign goods cheaper in the United States.
   But Graham Broyd, vice president in the foreign exchange
department at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said the dollar
bounced back fairly quickly as traders focused for another day on
price movements in the U.S. stock market.
   ``From that point on, the dollar tracked movements of the stock
market,'' he said.
   The dollar fell as the Dow Jones industrial average dipped about
60 points early in the day, but then the currency recovered to
finish above the closing levels reached earlier in Europe as the
Dow Jones average retraced lost ground. The Dow Jones average
finished with a loss of about 19 points.
   One reason for the interaction between the two markets is that
the Federal Reserve may encourage lower interest rates if the stock
market were to come anywhere near Friday's 190.58-point decline in
the Dow Jones industrial average. Falling interest rates would make
the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
   But Broyd said another reason is that many currency traders view
the U.S. stock market's recent volatility as more of a U.S. than a
worldwide problem. The volatility has been blamed by many
strategists on excessive borrowing for corporate takeovers.
   As a result, Broyd said currency traders feel a U.S. stock
market crash would hurt the dollar more than it would other
currencies.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 142.25 Japanese yen from 140.75 yen
at Monday's close. Later in London it edged up further to 142.35
yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 142.70 yen from 141.80 yen on
Monday.
   The dollar weakened against the British pound. In London, the
British pound rose to $1.5835 from $1.5820 late Monday. Later in
New York, the pound edged up to $1.57575 from $1.5750 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late rates
Monday included: 1.8672 West German marks, down from 1.8680; 1.6365
Swiss francs, up from 1.6340; 6.3475 French francs, down from
6.3480; 1,400.375 Italian lire, up from 1,374.50; and 1.17555
Canadian dollars, down from 1,17675.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday included:
1.8520 West German marks, down from 1.8650; 1.6227 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6345; 6.2960 French francs, down from 6.3365; 2.0867
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0805; 1,365.00 Italian lire, down from
1,372.50; 1.1755 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1765.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose
10 cents a troy ounce to $367.40.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $367.75 a troy ounce, up
from $366.50 bid late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $366.90 from $367 bid late Monday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold fell 42 cents to close at a bid $366.66.
   Silver for current delivery slipped 0.2 cent to $5.102 a troy
ounce on New York's Comex. In London, silver rose to a late bid of
$5.12 from $5.11 late Monday.

<TEXT>
   Rumors of more U.S. trade with communist nations sent futures
traders scurrying to buy soybeans and corn Tuesday, eclipsing
stock-index futures as the the center of action in the commodity
pits.
   Futures prices for soybeans and corn were mostly higher while
wheat prices were steady on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Stock index futures settled slightly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after a big recovery the previous session that
helped erase much of the anxiety left from Friday, when prices
plunged and played a role in a big stock selloff.
   The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, which jumped a record 15.65 points
Monday, settled .50 point lower at 344 points Tuesday. Each point
is worth $500.
   ``The main story was soybeans _ where there were strong rumors
that the Soviets are in the market for beans and meal, and a fairly
large quanity,'' said Ted Mao, a grains analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Soybeans contracts for delivery this winter had gained as much
as 10 cents just before the closing bell, then slipped.
   Steve Freed, a Chicago-based analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., also credited rains in U.S. central states harvest areas for
supporting soybeans.
   Corn was bolstered by Chinese demand, said Mao.
   Traders were talking about the possibility that the Chinese
could be buying as much as 500,000 metric tons. China purchased
150,000 metric tons of corn on Monday.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 1{ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.09{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{
cents higher, with December at $2.38} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
1{ cents higher, with December at $1.43} a bushel; and soybeans
were unchanged to 8{ cents higher with November at $5.55{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mecantile Exchange, livestock and pork prices
moved higher.
   Frozen pork bellies led the way, with prices settling as high as
190 points or 1.90 cents above Monday's close.
   ``The market ignored lower cash prices,'' said Phil Stanley of
DEC Futures Inc. ``Traders just believe demand will remain good for
pork and this remains a strong psychological factor.''
   Meanwhile, packing company interest at higher prices supported
cattle futures, he said.
   Cattle settled cent.32 to .93 cent higher, with the contract for
delivery in October at 73.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20
cent to .47 cent higher, with October at 83.10 cents a pound; live
hogs were .10 cent to .72 cent higher, with October at 48.00 cents;
and frozen pork bellies were 1.82 cents to 1.90 cents higher, with
February at 52.52 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices were generally higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``Heating oil was the star performer, pulling crude and gasoline
higher,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president of trading and
research for Carson Petroleum Co. in Chicago.
   Heating oil was strengthened by overseas demand and rising
concerns about the availablity of natural gas from the Soviet Union.
   Crude oil settled 14 cents to 16 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in November at $20.75 a barrel; heating oil was .45
cent to .72 cent higher, with November at 61.05 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .01 cent lower to 1.00 cent higher, with
November at 55.84 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals were steady on the Commodity Exchange in New
York.
   Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co., said there was a brief flurry of gold buying during
the day due to the 60-point dip in the Dow Jones Industrials and a
decline in the U.S. dollar.
   But when the dollar and New York Stock Exchange recovered, gold
prices also drifted lower, he said.
   Gold settled unchanged to 20 cents higher, with the contract for
October at $367.40 a troy ounce; and silver was .2 cents to .7
cents lower, with October at $5.10 a troy ounce.

   The U.S. Treasury bond market ended lower in
brisk, choppy trading Tuesday as investors moved in step with an
unsteady stock market.
   Market analysts said bonds relinquished earlier gains as prices
of stocks started to improve.
   ``Those that had bought are now giving up the hope that the
stock market will continue to tumble and that the flight to quality
into bonds will continue,'' said Jay Goldinger, a principal at the
Beverly Hills, Calif., investment firm Capital Insight Inc.
   The closely watched Dow Jones industrial average closed down
18.65 points at 2,638.73 Tuesday, after losing as much as 63 points
in late-morning trading. Analysts said the credit markets generally
shrugged off a government report that the merchandise trade deficit
rose in August to $10.77 billion from a revised July gap of $8.24
billion. The government also said industrial production edged down
0.1 percent in September.
   Both reports initially were intepreted by the credit markets to
mean that the economy was sluggish and interest rates had room to
decline.
   But as Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist with Nikko
Securities Co. International, explained, ``The market was not at
all behaving to fundamentals.''
   The credit markets also showed little reaction to news that the
Federal Reserve injected another $1.5 billion into the banking
system Tuesday after adding $2 billion in reserves on Monday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, the bellwether
30-year issue, fell about | point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face amount,
after rising around $6.25 by midday. Its yield, which moves
inversely from its price, jumped to 8.03 percent from 7.97 percent.
   The closely watched issue had fallen around $17.50 on Monday,
wiping out nearly all of the huge gains from Friday's rally.
   Prices of short-term government issues were off around 1-32
point, intermediate maturities fell between [ point and 5-16 point
and long-term issues lost around | point, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial-information service.

<HEAD>The Trade Deficit Increase: What It Means</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 31 percent increase in the nation's trade
deficit in August means Americans dug themselves deeper into debt
with the rest of the world.
   The trade deficit is the imbalance between what Americans buy
from overseas and what they ship to foreign customers. It rose in
August because exports declined a slight 0.2 percent while imports
jumped by 6.4 percent.
   The imbalance threatens jobs because it means consumers are
buying products made abroad instead of ones made by American
workers.
   Nations that run trade surpluses with the United States are
accumulating piles of dollars that they use to buy U.S. stocks,
bonds, factories and real estate.

<HEAD>Calls Off Talks With Unidentified Buyer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Integrated Resources Inc. said Tuesday it had
abandoned talks to sell core financial businesses to an
unidentified buyer and raised its estimate of second-quarter losses
above the previously announced $600 million.
   But Integrated said a group of senior executive officers had
advised the firm that it intends to make a proposal to buy three of
the five principal financial businesses.
   The struggling investment concern, which defaulted on debt
payments in June, had been negotiating to sell key assets to raise
money to pay some of its $1.75 billion in outstanding debt and
avoid a bankruptcy filing.
   The annoucements Tuesday sent Integrated stock falling 25 cents
to $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Integrated was trading
around $16 a share in May.
   Integrated's principal financial businesses are Integrated
Resources Equity Corp. of Englewood, Colo., its principal
broker-dealer subsidiary; Resources Trust Co.; and Integrated
Resources Asset Management Corp., an investment adviser.
   The firm also is seeking to sell two of its life insurance
companies, Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines,
Iowa, and Capitol Life Insurance Co. of Denver.
   ``If we can arrange the sale of these three core companies, we
feel that we will be in a stronger position to sell Integrated
Resources Life Insurance Co. and maximize its value,'' Integrated
Chairman Stephen Weinroth said in a statement.
   ``Accordingly, we feel that this proposal should be considered
in order to further our overall restructuring plan,'' he said.
   Integrated said last week it was negotating with an unidentified
third party for the sale of the five principal financial companies
after a $310 million deal with Whitehall Financial Group fell
through.
   Privately held Whitehall said it could not obtain financing for
the planned $310 million transaction, citing worsening conditions
in the nation's debt financing markets and concerns over the value
of the businesses.
   Integrated has not paid any principal or interest to bondholders
since June, when it said it would have to default because of
worsening troubles stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out
of real estate into financial services.
   Integrated said its previously announced estimate of $600
million in second-quarter losses after taxes was based partly on
the planned sale of its core financial businesses.
   The firm said it expects to report a higher loss because ``of
the change in its expectations as to the proceeds from a sale of
the core businesses as well as other events which have occurred
subsequent to Integrated's previous announcement.''

<HEAD>China Buys More U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought additional U.S. wheat under a
price subsidy program, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said three private exporting
companies made the deals for a total of 300,000 metric tons under
the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized
China under EEP last Feb. 27.
   With the latest EEP approvals, China has 340,000 tons remaining
to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 11 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at $3.85 per bushel, the wheat
would have a farm value of around $42 milion.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $12.81 per ton, or
about 35 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by the Peavey Co., 210,000
tons; Cargill Inc., 50,000; and Bunge Corp., 40,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 4.3 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began
on June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China bought
more than 8 million tons of U.S. wheat, all of it under the EEP
program.

<HEAD>Airline Deals Prove the Takeover Game Survives Although the Rules
Are Changed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The rules of the mergers game may be changing,
but it was clear Tuesday there's no shortage of players _ even if
there is turmoil on Wall Street.
   While UAL Corp. executives were trying to appease big banks and
salvage a planned buyout of the parent of United Airlines, a much
smaller carrier, Mesa Airlines Inc., received a takeover bid from
Stateswest Airlines Inc.
   Stateswest _ like Mesa a small regional carrier _ declined to
reveal the terms. But coming as the stock market continued to
fluctuate _ the Dow Jones industrial average closed down more than
18 points after seesawing throughout Tuesday's session _ the offer
showed there's still confidence in the takeover business.
   In the UAL deal, the management-led investor group seeking to
buy the airline restructured its offer and lowered its price to
$5.62 billion from $6.75 billion, trying to persuade Japanese banks
to help finance the takeover.
   News that banks would not back the deal contributed to the stock
market's tremendous slide on Friday, when the Dow Jones average
plunged 190 points. It also raised concerns that takeovers had
skidded to a halt.
   On Monday, one possible takeover bid became a casualty of the
market volatility as developer Donald Trump withdrew his $7.5
billion proposed offer for AMR Inc., the parent of American
Airlines.
   Andrew Geller, who follows AMR for Provident National Bank in
Philadephia, said the snag in the UAL offer probably helped Trump
decide to shelve his proposal.
   Observers said the takeover business would survive the UAL
problems and the tumult on Wall Street. But billion-dollar buyouts
were expected to be more difficult to accomplish and prospective
deals were likely to undergo the same kind of scrutiny as the UAL
offer.
   Bankers have become cautious because companies such as Campeau
Corp. and Resorts International Inc. have been unable to make the
interest payments following takeovers.
   Campeau, for example, ran into trouble because its Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. units did not have
the kind of sales that Chairman Robert Campeau anticipated when he
went heavily into debt to buy the two retailers.
   Without those sales, Campeau did not have enough cash to pay his
bills.
   Bankers want to ensure that a company will be able to handle the
heavy debt load undertaken in a buyout and ``are looking at a
certain kind of credit risk,'' Geller said.
   UAL's bankers are concerned about a falloff in air travel. If
United does less business it would not have the cash needed to
service its debt, and its assets _ particularly its fleet of
airplanes _ would be worth less because of the reduced demand.
   By lowering its price, the group seeking UAL is lowering the
payments it would have to make after the buyout and thereby easing
its cash flow requirements.
   While all deals will be examined closely, some prospective
buyers will have an easier time than others.
   For instance, analysts say, if KohlbergKravis Roberts &amp; Co. were
presenting its $24.53 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc. before banks
today, it likely would win approval for its proposal faster than if
it were buying an airline like United.
   The reason is that RJR Nabisco has a business that is considered
``recession proof.'' Even if consumers become cautious, they'll
still buy the food and tobacco company's products and its cash flow
would likely be steady.
   Put another way, consumers might forgo expensive vacations and
put a crimp in an airline's cash flow, but they would not stop
buying Oreo cookies or Camel filters.

<HEAD>Morgan Stanley Posts Sharply Higher Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morgan Stanley Group Inc. said Tuesday its
earnings almost doubled in the third quarter while revenue grew by
more than a third.
   The investment firm said most of its major lines of business
contributed to the profit and revenue growth.
   Morgan Stanley earned $101 million, or $2.54 a share, in the
three months ended Sept. 30, up from $52 million, or $1.31 a share,
in 1988's third quarter.
   Revenue rose 37.4 percent to $582.4 million in the third quarter
from $423.8 million a year earlier.
   This year's revenue was boosted by a pre-tax $56.2 million gain
from the restructuring of Burlington Holdings Inc. Morgan Stanley
led the 1987 buyout of the textile manufacturer Burlington
Industries.
   A joint statement from Morgan Stanley's Chairman S. Parker
Gilbert, President Richard B. Fisher and Vice Chairman Robert F.
Greenhill said the company's third quarter performance was
favorable.
   ``Mergers and acquisitions activity continued at high levels,
and our global sales and trading businesses once again benefited
from our strong market position, particularly in the areas of
international equity-related products and foreign exchange,'' the
executives said.
   For the first three quarters of this year, Morgan Stanley had
after-tax income of $294.4 million, or $7.40 a share, up about 2.8
percent from $286.3 million, or $7.41 a share, a year earlier. The
per-share earnings were adjusted to reflect the impact of a 3-for-2
stock split that took effect Feb. 27, 1989.
   Nine-month revenue rose 8.7 percent to $1.75 billion from $1.61
billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Boeing Union Says Settlement Will Cost More Now Than Before Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. must offer more to settle a two-week
strike by production workers than it would have cost to win
contract approval before the walkout, a union leader said Tuesday.
   A halt in other labor negotiations with Boeing also shows the
world's largest commercial airplane builder ``isn't going to get
serious with any other group until they settle with us,'' said Tom
Baker, president of District Lodge 751 of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   Discounting the likelihood of a quick settlement from
negotiations that resume Wednesday, Baker said voting down a second
contract offer could leave both sides even more entrenched and
farther apart.
   ``That's why we, on this side of the table, have to be so
cautious about taking anything back to the membership that could
possibly be rejected,'' he said.
   Of the 57,800 Boeing workers represented by the Machinists,
43,300 in the Puget Sound area are covered by the district lodge,
while 12,000 other Machinists are in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in
Portland, Ore., and a few hundred at scattered sites in California,
Utah, Hawaii, Montana and other states.
   Amid growing reports of airline concern over delivery delays,
talks were set to resume Wednesday afternoon in the office of
federal mediator Douglas Hammond, who called the two sides together
for the first talks since Oct. 2.
   The strike began Oct. 4 after an 85 percent vote to walk out
rather than accept a three-year contract with wage increases of 4
percent the first year, 3 percent the second and 3 percent the
third; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3
percent the second; cost-of-living boosts virtually matching
inflation; and higher benefits.
   ``The money package is first. We have to improve that money
package. Everything else is second,'' Baker said.
   To end the strike, Boeing must offer more money than would have
been required to win approval Oct. 3 and further ease the number of
overtime hours workers must put in, as well as make concessions in
other areas, he said. He declined to be more specific.
   The rejected offer would have reduced mandatory overtime from
200 hours a quarter to 160 hours. As strikers spend more time with
their families ``that has become a real hot issue,'' Baker said.
   Boeing contends it needs the overtime work to keep up with a
huge backlog of jet orders.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr refused to say whether the
company's negotiators would have a new offer Wednesday.
   ``If the company doesn't have a better offer, then these talks
are kind of futile,'' said Jack Daniels, communications director
for District Lodge 751.
   Members of the United Aerospace Workers Local 1069, representing
about 3,200 production and maintenance workers at Boeing
Helicopters near Philadelphia, voted Sunday to approve an
indefinite extension of their contract, which previously was
extended 10 days.
   Carr said Tuesday the issues there were similar to those for the
Machinists. ``They'll wait now until the IAM settles, I'd expect,''
he said.
   Boeing negotiators walked out Monday in the first day of
negotiations with the company's second-largest union, the Seattle
Professional Engineering Employees Association, citing ``grossly
excessive'' pay demands.
   Those talks, which cover 28,000 engineers and technical support
workers, about 95 percent in the Puget Sound area, will resume next
Monday at the request of a federal mediator, said Dan Mahoney,
general counsel to the unaffiliated union. The association's
contract expires Dec. 1.
   Boeing delivered two aircraft Monday, a 767 to Lauda Air of
Austria and a 757 to United Airlines, bringing to seven the number
of jets delivered during the walkout.
   Dick Shimizu of America West Airlines said the Arizona-based
carrier was told a 757 it was expecting Thursday wouldn't be
delivered until Nov. 7, delaying the the start of four daily routes
out of Houston from Nov. 6 to Jan. 12, but a 737 scheduled for
delivery in December should be on time.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened to
$10.77 billion in August as imports flooded in at a record pace,
the government said Tuesday in a dose of bad news that didn't help
a skittish stock market.
   The Federal Reserve Board moved for the second straight day to
soothe investors' worries, pumping $1.5 billion into the banking
system a day after making a $2 billion cash infusion.
   The money is intended to calm jittery markets by showing the
Fed's resolve to make sure banks have enough reserves to keep loans
flowing to brokerage houses caught in a cash squeeze because of
falling stock prices.
   The Commerce Department said the August trade shortfall between
imports and exports was the largest imbalance in eight months and
was 31 percent bigger than a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.
   At the White House, the Bush administration expressed
disappointment in the trade report.
   ``This is, of course, an unwelcome increase and we're hopeful
that it simply is a one-month situation and will turn arond,''
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   Asked if the administration feared that the trade numbers would
drive the market down, Fitzwater said, ``The market seems stable
and the economy is sound and there is no cause for disruption of
that kind.''
   The market did retreat significantly in the hours after the
trade deficit announcement, dropping by more than 60 points at one
time. But the market rallied with the Dow Jones industrial average
finishing the day down 18.65 points.
   Tuesday's performance followed a gain of 88.12 points Monday and
a plunge of 190 points Friday.
   Analysts said that the surprisingly bad trade figure was just
one of several reasons for the market's gyrations Tuesday. Another
factor cited was the continued uncertainty over the proposed buyout
of UAL Corp., the parent company of United Airlines.
   The sharply higher trade deficit for August also captured the
attention of Democrats in Congress unhappy with the Bush
administration's trade policies.
   House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri said the
August deficit showed a ``continued erosion of our economic
strength. ... It's time that this administration recognize the
battle we face in trade.''
   Private analysts said they feared that the worsening trade
deficit signaled a return to much higher imbalances, which would
act to dampen domestic growth in coming months.
   ``The last time we had sharply higher trade deficits in 1986, it
almost brought the economy to its knees and the economy had a great
deal more steam behind it than it does now,'' said David Jones, an
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   The August imbalance resulted from a 0.2 percent decline in
exports, which fell to $30.4 billion, and a 6.4 percent increase in
imports, which rose to a record $41.2 billion. The trade deficit is
the difference between imports and exports.
   Economists blamed the record imports on the strength of the U.S.
dollar through much of this year. A stronger dollar makes foreign
goods cheaper for American consumers while making U.S. exports more
expensive on overseas markets.
   ``Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more
attractive,'' said William T. Archey, a trade expert at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
   Through the first eight months of this year, the U.S. trade
deficit was running at an annual rate of $109.7 billion, down
slightly from a 1988 deficit of $118.5 billion. The 7.4 percent
improvement compares to a 22 percent decline in the deficit for all
of 1988, a year when a narrowing trade gap contributed almost half
of the total growth in the economy.
   Analysts are worried that if the trade performance deteriorates
too much in coming months it could seriously jeopardize economic
prospects for next year.
   In a further sign of a slowing economy, the government also
reported Tuesday that industrial production dipped 0.1 percent in
September, the first decline in six months, as the output at
factories making both durable and non-durable goods fell.
   The $10.77 billion August trade deficit was the first increase
in the deficit since May and was the biggest imbalance since a
$10.8 billion December deficit.
   The nation's foreign oil bill increased 0.4 percent to $4.3
billion in August as an increase in volume was partially offset by
a fall in price.
   The amount of imported oil rose to 8.67 million barrels a day
from 8.14 million in July, but the average price per barrel fell to
$16.14 from $17.12.
   As usual, the largest trade deficit in August was with Japan, an
imbalance of $3.99 billion, down from $4 billion in July. The
deficit was $1.4 billion with Taiwan, $1.2 billion with Canada,
$700 million with South Korea and $600 million with China.

   A 36 percent gain in net income and a 33

<HEAD>Reports Earnings of $29.9 Million In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. on Tuesday reported third
quarter earnings of $29.9 million, compared with a loss the company
took during the same period in 1988 amid an anti-takeover
restructuring.
   The camera and film maker had a $54.1 million loss in the third
quarter last year, or a loss of 77 cents per share. For the third
quarter of 1989, which ended Oct. 1, the company reported earnings
of 40 cents per share.
   The 1988 loss included a $97 million charge to cover costs
associated with the restructuring plan, which included the
elimination of more than 1,000 jobs under a voluntary severance
plan.
   The restructuring plan was intended partly to thwart a takeover
attempt by Shamrock Holdings, an entity controlled by Roy E.
Disney, nephew of Walt Disney.
   In a prepared statement, I. MacAllister Booth, president and
chief executive officer, said: ``We continue to show improvement in
both gross margin and overhead spending resulting in increases in
operating profits for the third quarter and for the year to date.''
   For the first nine months of this year, earnings were $98.5
million, or $1.27 per share, compared with a loss of $15.1 million,
or 23 cents per share, during the same period last year.
   Total sales for the quarter were $437.7 million, a slight
increase from $436.3 million in 1988. For the first nine months,
sales were $1.36 billion, compared with $1.33 billion in the same
period last year.
   The company, known for its instant photography, said it
introduced its line of conventional film in Europe late in the
third quarter and was receiving strong initial demand.

<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weyerhaeuser Co. said Tuesday its
third-quarter earnings rose 15 percent from a year ago but noted
the earnings were affected by some corporate restructuring and a
stock sale.
   For the quarter, the timber company earned $166.8 million or 78
cents per share on sales of $2.57 billion, compared with earnings
of $144.9 million or 69 cents a share on sales of $2.36 billion a
year earlier.
   For the first nine months, Weyerhaeuser's earnings totaled
$469.8 million or $2.21 a share on sales of $7.54 billion, compared
with earnings of $410.3 million or $1.95 a share on sales of $6.95
billion.
   Weyerhaeuser said third-quarter figures include losses of $33
million stemming from its business improvement and refocusing
program, but a gain of $49 million from selling stock in its North
Pacific Paper Co. subsidiary to Jujo Paper of Japan. That had the
effect of adding 5 cents per share to the earnings for the third
quarter.
   Weyerhaeuser has sold or is seeking buyers for a number of
secondary operations, including its nursery supply business, milk
carton operation, Australian remanufacturing and distributing
company, and a small health and beauty aids company.

   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, said Tuesday
that third-quarter earnings fell 9 percent compared with a year
ago, while No. 7 Manufacturers Hanover Corp. posted a $789 million
loss due to a big addition to its reserve for bad Third World loans.
   Separately, No. 11-ranked Wells Fargo &amp; Co. reported its
earnings rose 17 percent during the quarter, and No. 15 Bank of New
England Corp. said its earnings dropped 41 percent in the period.
   New York-based Citicorp earned $358 million, or 99 cents per
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with earnings
of $394 million, or $1.13 a share, last year. Combined interest
income and non-interest income gained 11 percent to $3.5 billion.
   Manufacturers Hanover posted a loss of $789 million, or $15.46
per share, compared with a profit of $198 million, or $3.77 per
share, in third quarter 1988. Combined interest and non-interest
revenue declined to $796 million from $949 million in the year
earlier quarter.
   Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, earned $153.7 million, or
$2.83 a share, in the third quarter, up from $131.7 million, or
$2.36 per share, in 1988.
   Bank of New England earned $42.7 million, or 61 cents a share,
compared with a profit of $72.3 million, or $1.04 a share, in last
year's third quarter.
   Citicorp said it had strong results from many areas, including
the global consumer business and domestic credit-card operation.
   But it said continued uncertainty about Third World debt helped
drag down earnings. It noted that Argentina made no loan payments
this year, vs. $26 million reported in the first three quarters of
last year, while Brazil made no payments in the third quarter after
paying $154 million the previous two quarters.
   Citicorp said its reserve to cover possible losses on Third
World debt was $2.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, or 30
percent of its $8.9 billion in total medium- and long-term loans to
less developed countries.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Citicorp earned $1.3 billion,
or $3.62 cents a share, up 15 percent from $1.1 billion, or $3.17 a
share, in net income for the 1988 period.
   The results include, among other things, a $77 million after-tax
gain from the sale of property in Japan this year and a $55 million
after-tax gain from the sale of the U.S. pension fund management
business last year.
   Manufacturers Hanover's net loss stemmed from the addition of
$950 million to its reserve against possible losses on loans to
developing countries, announced earlier this year. Without the
reserve addition and tax benefits, the company would have had net
income of $91 million.
   The company said the addition boosted its reserve for Third
World loans rose to $2.4 billion, or 36 percent of its total
outstanding medium- and long-term loans to developing countries.
   Manufacturers Hanover said its operating earnings benefited from
an improved net interest margin, better domestic credit quality and
expense control. Results for the third quarter included $213
million in one-time revenue from the sale of assets, down from $578
million in the year-earlier quarter.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Manufacturers Hanover said it
lost $580 million, or $11.82 per share, compared with profit of
$742 million, or $14.28 per share, a year earlier.
   Wells Fargo said its earnings rose in the third quarter largely
from higher net interest income, specifically from an increase in
domestic loans. Net interest income rose to $544 million from $508
million a year ago.
   Non-interest income was $191.9 million, compared with $193.3
million, while non-interest expense was $393.4 million, up form
$392.7 million.
   At the end of the third quarter Wells Fargo said it had no
medium- or long-term loans to less developed countries. Its
provision for overall loan losses rose to $82 million from $75
million.
   During the nine-month period, Wells Fargo's earnings totaled
$442.6 million, or $8.07 a share, vs. $376.6 million, or $6.75 a
share, in 1988.
   Bank of New England said its net interest income totaled $254.7
million, down 10 percent from last year's third quarter.
Non-interest income totaled $114.4 million, compared with $95.2
million in the year-ago period.
   For the first nine months of this year, earnings were $121.6
million, or $1.73 per share, down from $207.7 million, or $3 per
share for the first nine months last year.
   Bank of New England also announced a restructuring that will
include the sale of 53 branches and the consolidation of a number
of departments that will result in the loss of 800 jobs. In
addition, it will close its loan-production offices in Chicago, New
York and Philadelphia.

<HEAD>Cable Operator Agrees To Buy 50 Percent of Showtime Networks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. said
Tuesday it has agreed to buy a half-interest in Showtime Networks
Inc., the nation's second largest provider of pay-TV service, for
$225 million.
   Showtime's parent, Viacom International Inc., had been trying to
sell a stake in Showtime to companies in the cable industry for
some time.
   Denver-based TCI is the nation's largest cable system operator
with an estimated 10 million subscribers.
   If it completes the deal, which is subject to reaching a
definitive agreement and regulatory approval, TCI could provide
wider distribution of the two pay channels that Showtime Networks
offers.
   Showtime Networks operates Showtime, which carries a mix of
movies, original programming and sports events such as boxing, and
The Movie Channel, which carries theatrical movies. They claim a
combined total of 10 million subscribers.
   The pay-TV leader is Time Warner Inc.'s Home Box Office Inc.,
whose HBO and Cinemax services have about 24 million subscribers.
   ``Pay television is a vital part of TCI's business operations,''
said John C. Malone, TCI's president and chief executive officer.
``It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and
competitive pay television marketplace, which we believe this
agreement fosters.''
   The statement said that the transaction may include other
investors who would share in its 50 percent stake in Showtime
Networks.
   Viacom will continue to be responsible for management of the
pay-TV concern under terms of the deal.
   Frank J. Biondi Jr., Viacom's president and chief executive,
said, ``We are delighted to have TCI as our partner'' and said he
was confident that Showtime would be ``a very productive and
profitable business for years to come.''
   Winston H. Cox, chairman and chief executive of Showtime, said
TCI's involvement is a ``vote of confidence'' in Showtime and
should ``enhance our competitive position in the pay television
market and enable Showtime to achieve its full potential.''
   Viacom is a New York-based communications and entertainmnet
company. Its holding company, Viacom Inc., is 83 percent owned by
National Amusements Inc., a Dedham, Mass.-based theater chain
controlled by billionaire Sumner Redstone.

<HEAD>Simmons Buys More Lockheed Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the stock market was dropping Friday, Dallas
billionaire Harold C. Simmons was buying more stock in Lockheed
Corp., increasing his holding in the defense contractor to 10.62
percent.
   Simmons filed documents Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission saying companies he controls purchased 122,700 shares of
Lockheed on Friday at prices ranging from $47.12{ to $48 per share.
   The purchases give Simmons 6.74 million shares of the Calabasas,
Calif.-based company, making him its largest individual shareholder.
   Simmons began acquiring stock in the maker of the stealth
fighter in April, sparking speculation he intended to take over the
company. Lockheed responded by creating an employee stock ownership
plan that holds 17 percent of the company's stock, effectively
blocking an unfriendly takeover.
   The latest filing says Simmons had not changed his plans for the
stake. In his original statement he said his purchases were ``for
purposes of investment and in order to acquire a significant equity
interest in the company.''
   Simmons included in the filing a statement refuting a weekend
report he intended to sell his Lockheed stake. Simmons said the
report took out of context statements he had made in jest at the
end of a lengthy interview.

<HEAD>Merck, Warner-Lambert Report Higher Third-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead and ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with Rohm and Haas earnings.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three major drug makers announced higher third-quarter earnings
Tuesday, with profits up 25 percent at Merck &amp; Co. Inc., 22 percent
at Warner-Lambert Co. and 24 percent at Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Meanwhile,
Rohm and Haas Co. reported a 35 percent decline in third-quarter
earnings.
   Rahway, N.J.-based Merck said its earnings rose to $390.5
million, or 99 cents a share, from $311.8 million, or 79 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 9 percent to $1.6 billion from
$1.4 billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, earnings rose to
$1.1 billion, or $2.85 a share, up from $899 million, or $2.28 a
share, in 1988. Sales were $4.78 billion, up from $4.40 billion.
   ``Sales growth for the first nine months was led by new
products,'' Merck Chairman P. Roy Vagelos said in a news release.
``Strong unit volume gains were registered by our both our domestic
and international operations.''
   Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert said its net earnings
for the quarter rose to $107 million, or $1.58 a share, from $88
million, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7 percent to
$1.10 billion from $1.03 billion a year earlier, Warner-Lambert
said.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Warner-Lambert
said its earnings rose to $320.4 million, or $4.73 a share, from
$262.8 million, or $3.86 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$3.15 billion from $2.91 billion.
   Eli Lilly said profit in its latest quarter rose to $212.4
million, or 73 cents a share, from $171.4 million, or 60 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.05 billion from $941
million a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, Lilly said earnings rose
to $714.2 million, or $2.45 a share, from $585.3 million, or $2.04
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.39 billion from $3.03
billion.
   Philadelphia-based Rohm and Haas earned $32.6 million, or 49
cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with $49.8 million,
or 75 cents per share, in 1988.
   Sales of $623 million were up 1 percent from last year's
third-quarter sales of $619.8 million, the company said.
   ``The effects of a slowing U.S. economy, capacity limitations
for key product lines and high costs associated with our capital
expenditure program combined to push earnings well below the 1988
level,'' said Chairman J. Lawrence Wilson.
   Profit for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $155 million,
or $2.33 per share, a 17 percent decrease from earnings of $187.8
million, or $2.82 per share, in the same 1988 period. Nine-month
sales totaled $2 billion, a 5 percent increase over the $1.9
billion reported in 1988.

   Share prices rebounded sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Tuesday morning, while the U.S. dollar firmed against the
Japanese yen.
   Other stock markets in Asia followed suit, rebounding from
significant losses posted Monday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
647.33 points Monday in its biggest tumble of the year, regained
most of that in the morning session in Tokyo by rising 618.89
points, or 1.79 percent, to 35,087.38.
   Dealers said the market was encouraged by the rebound Monday on
Wall Street, which saw the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rise
88.12 points following Friday's 190.58-point plunge.
   ``It is just the opposite of Monday's trading pattern,'' said a
dealer with Nikko Securities, a major Japanese brokerage.
   The dealer, who spoke anonymously, said the market was filled
with buy orders. ``There are no sell orders at all.''
   The recovery of the Dow Jones and Nikkei indexes gave the U.S.
dollar a boost. The dollar started trading at 141.97 yen, up 1.22
yen from Monday's close, and firmed to 142.10 yen at the end of the
morning.
   ``The only news is that the stock market has rebounded. There
has been nothing else this morning,'' said Sumio Fukushima, a
dealer with Sumitomo Bank.
   The dollar should remain in a narrow range until the release in
Washington later Tuesday of U.S. trade figures for August, a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo said.
   Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 4.5 percent in
the first 10 minutes of trading. The index had plunged 6.5 percent
Monday.
   Market indexes in Australia and New Zealand, which fell about 8
percent Monday, were up 3.5 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively,
while the Manila exchange opened 1.11 percent higher, recouping
some of Monday's 5.92 percent drop. Singapore's market rallied 4.4
percent in early trading after plunging 10 percent Monday.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which was the first major foreign
market to open open after the Dow Jones industrial average fell
190.58 points Friday in New York, on Monday weathered its biggest
dive this year without sustained panic selling.
   Some analysts had feared the Friday the 13th slide in New York
would trigger a worldwide crash like in 1987, when Wall Street's
Black Monday, Oct. 19,1987 was followed by Black Tuesday plunges
around the world.
   But on Monday, trading was thin and the capital-rich Tokyo
market's main barometer dropped 1.8 percent _ compared with its
record 15 percent drop on Oct. 20, 1987.
   ``Domestic economic conditions are still favorable,'' Japanese
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters, explaining he
did not think the Wall Street turmoil would cause a collapse in
Tokyo.
   The dollar also tumbled in Tokyo, opening at 139.95 yen, sharply
lower than its Friday closes of 144.00 yen in Tokyo and 142.05 yen
in New York, but bounced back to finish at 140.75 yen.
   Other Far East financial markets posted losses ranging from
moderate to large on Monday. But Asian investors did not send share
prices reeling as deeply as they did two years ago after Wall
Street crashed.
