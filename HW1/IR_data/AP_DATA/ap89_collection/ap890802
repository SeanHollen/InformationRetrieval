   Saudi Arabia on Wednesday denounced both
the Israeli kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric and the killing of
U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   The official Saudi press agency quoted ``a responsible source''
as saying Riyadh ``always condemns and denounces terrorist acts of
all forms and of whatever methods ... These are despicable, inhuman
acts.''
   Arab media criticized Israel for abducting Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid from south Lebanon Friday and urged the United States to show
restraint amid reports of U.S. fleet movements in the Mediterranean.
   The Dubai-based Al-Bayan wrote in an editorial: ``Israel has
flung the doors of hell wide open.''
   ``What is the objective behind the Israeli act which can only be
classified as organized state terrorism?'' asked Abu Dhabi's
state-run Al-Ittihad daily.
   The hard-line newspaper Al-Khaleej, in neighboring Sharjah
emirate, said ``the Zionist terrorist operation in south Lebanon
and its repercussions must be attributed to U.S. policy in the
region and the full and unconditional U.S. bias toward Israel.''
   The Kuwait newspaper Al-Rai Al-Aam cautioned the United States
against a military response to Higgins' purported hanging.
   ``The United States does not possess many effective means for a
speedy revenge of the hanging of a Marine colonel by a group
operating in a country with usurped sovereignty such as Lebanon.
   ``An effective military action is impossible in a country
overburdened with rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, bombs,
booby-trapped cars and suicide squads, which could be mobilized in
any reaction to an American retaliatory strike,'' it wrote.
   Oman's leading Al-Watan newspaper said ``blame should be pinned
on Israel as it is the instrument of violence in the region.''
   Al-Watan and other Persian Gulf newspapers, urged self-restraint
in the crisis.
   The newspapers noted that an Arab League committee announced an
impasse in efforts to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The Qatar newspaper Al-Raya said that Israel could exploit the
situation ``to direct a major blow against Lebanon'' that could
lead to its ``partition into small states after
internationalization of its crisis.''
   Syria voiced ``surprise and outrage'' at claims of Higgins'
death but blamed Israel for abducting Obeid and refusing to free
him. Israel offered to exchange Obeid and Shiite Moslem prisoners
it holds for three Israeli servicemen and all 16 foreign hostages
in Lebanon.
   Egypt, a U.S. ally and at peace with Israel, urged ``all parties
concerned, whether regional or international, to exercise extreme
self-restraint.''

<HEAD>`Cheers,' `13 East' Lead NBC to 58th Consecutive Ratings Win</HEAD>

   NBC might have flopped with its nurse drama
``Nightingales,'' but its summer nurse comedy ``13 East'' finished
in the Top 10, helping the network win another Nielsen ratings
derby victory.
   For the week ended July 30, NBC's ``Cheers'' landed in first
place for the fourth time in five weeks, narrowly topping ABC's
``Roseanne.'' ``Cheers'' had a rating of 17.5, only one-tenth of a
point ahead of ``Roseanne.''
   Last week they tied for first place at 17.4.
   NBC easily won the week for its 58th straight victory in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. survey. The only surprise in the Top 10 was the
appearance of lightly regarded ``13 East,'' which finished 10th.
   Other than CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote,'' all
the shows in the Top 10 were comedies.
   The ratings are certainly proof of the resurgence of the
situation comedy, which was all but written off a few years ago.
   Prime-time soap operas like ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty'' dominated
the ratings until the appearance of ``The Cosby Show'' in 1984. In
the 1983-84 season the only comedy in the Top 10 was CBS' ``Kate &amp;
Allie.''
   Comedy also dominated the second 10 highest-rated shows this
past week with seven entries.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's
``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``Dear
John,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' tied,
CBS ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' and NBC's
``13 East.''
   Fox Broadcasting continued its summer surge in the ratings.
``Married ... With Children'' was in 29th place, ``America's Most
Wanted'' was tied for 34th and ``Totally Hidden Video'' was tied
for 39th place.
   NBC was first with an average of 10.8, CBS was second with 8.9
and ABC was third with 8.7. The averages since the fall season
began on Sept. 19 were: NBC 14.8, ABC 11.9 and CBS 11.8.
   The ratings is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million
homes in the United States with television. The share is the
percentage of sets in use.
   The NBC summer show, ``Knight and Daye,'' did not fare that well
in the ratings. It was in 37th place.
   The lowest-rated show on the three networks was CBS' ``American
Nuclear.'' Here are the bottom five: CBS' ``Tour of Duty,'' NBC's
``Jim Henson,'' ABC's ``Nick and Frankie,'' ABC's
``Trans-Antarctica Expedition'' and CBS' ``American Nuclear.''
   CBS had the highest-rated evening news show. The ratings: CBS
9.0, ABC 8.8 and NBC 8.6.

<HEAD>Man Holding Hostage in Courtroom Kills Her, Then Self</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-sheriff's deputy held his former
girlfriend hostage in a courtroom for nearly seven hours Tuesday,
then killed himself and her, authorities said.
   Officials and bystanders heard two muffled shots at 9:45 p.m.
from the courtroom where Manny Cabano seized Juanita Hermosilla, a
county clerk who had obtained a restraining order against Cabano
the day before.
   Paramedics and sheriff's authorities then rushed in and found
Cabano dead, with a gunshot wound to the head, and Ms. Hermosilla
critically wounded.
   Ms. Hermosilla was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort
Worth, where she died at 10:17 p.m. while undergoing emergency
surgery, said Eric Gordon, night administrator. Both victims were
in their 40s.
   Cabano used a .44-caliber pistol he'd taken to the courtroom in
the suicide-murder, said Tarrant County Sheriff Capt. Tony Wise.
Cabano had also seized a .38-caliber pistol from the justice of the
peace in whose courtroom Ms. Hermosilla worked.
   The gunman apparently went to Ms. Hermosilla's home and opened
her mail, finding court papers relating to the restraining order,
before storming the courtroom, sheriff's officials said.
   The standoff began when Cabano grabbed the woman in Justice of
the Peace Robert Ashmore's first-floor courtroom at the Tarrant
County Courthouse at about 3 p.m.
   Police negotiated with Cabano, sometimes through Ms. Hermosilla,
via telephone during the standoff. Wise said talks with Cabano were
improving about 8 p.m. and authorities thought the situation would
end without bloodshed.
   ``Our hopes were building,'' he said.
   But then Ms. Hermosilla came on the line and ``she requested
that she talk to her boys. That's always a bad sign.''
   Wise didn't say whether Ms. Hermosilla was able to speak to her
children.
   Police special weapons and tactics units were dispatched to the
scene but left about 5 p.m., when the Sheriff's Department said
they would take over, said Fort Worth police spokesman Doug Clarke.
   ``Judge Ashmore said he worked with the man and knew him. The
sheriff said he worked with him and knew him,'' Clarke said.
   A sheriff's department dispatcher who did not wish to be
identified said Cabano ``worked here as a deputy years and years
ago. He then became a bail bondsman until he went bankrupt about a
year ago.''
   Four of Ms. Hermosilla's five children, some in their teens,
rushed to the courthouse about 5 p.m., but were taken away by
several of her co-workers.
   Police blocked off the area and evacuated about 300 people in
the courthouse and the City Administration Building across the
street.

   This northwestern Minnesota town with 250
students is challenging larger districts in the state to top its
attendance record and graduation rate.
   Rothsay, in fact, is willing to give $500 in scholarship money
to the first three districts that can top its accomplishments. The
challenge is aimed at districts with more than 4,000 students.
   ``We've been listening to things like, `Bigger is better,' ''
said Tom Fosse, a school board member and president of the Rothsay
Community Development Corp., which is providing the money. ``We're
saying maybe that's not true.''
   Rothsay is issuing the challenge in response to a legislative
auditor's report issued in December saying some of the state's
smallest school districts are not providing students with a good
education and should be phased out.
   ``When you read the report, it just sounds like we're doing such
a terrible job with our young folks,'' said DuWayne Balken,
chairman of the school board. ``We believe that's not true at all.
They're very well prepared.''
   School districts accepting the challenge must meet or exceed
Rothsay's record in average daily attendance and graduation rates
over the last three school years.
   The challenge also includes the rate of extracurricular
participation, the percentage of high school graduates who entered
a post-secondary school and the percentage that earned degrees from
a four-year institution, all during the last three years.
   School officials are confident even though they haven't checked
numbers to see how Rothsay has fared in those categories.
   ``We know they're high,'' Fosse said. ``We're confident that
we'll stack up well. We're waiting for a challenge.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has angered
powerful political associates with a Cabinet shuffle that
humiliated her longtime foreign secretary.
   It was not so much what she did on July 24 _ when 13 of the 22
Cabinet posts changed hands _ that has upset the hierarchy of the
usually well-disciplined Conservative Party.
   It was her manner of doing it that left wounds and resentments
which, some analysts believe, could mark the beginning of
Thatcher's political end.
   ``Many of us found what went on nauseating,'' Tory legislator
David Howell, chairman of the House of Commons foreign affairs
committee, said in a television interview.
   He spoke after news broke of how Mrs. Thatcher moved aside Sir
Geoffrey Howe, Britain's longest-serving foreign secretary since
World War II, and replaced him with a virtual unknown, John Major.
   In the process, according to Howe's aides, Mrs. Thatcher offered
Howe another senior, but less prestigious job as home secretary _
without consulting the incumbent, Douglas Hurd.
   Howe, 62, turned that post down as a demotion after six years as
foreign secretary. He settled for what Mrs. Thatcher's office
called the ``courtesy title'' of deputy prime minister and the job
of government leader in the House of Commons.
   Howe also accepted residence in a country mansion, Dorneywood,
which currently is used as a weekend retreat by the third member of
Mrs. Thatcher's top Cabinet trio, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson.
   ``This is how regimes behave when they have begun to take power
for granted,'' commented London Sunday Times columnist Robert
Harris.
   Off the record, government ministers were quoted as complaining
that Mrs. Thatcher, who has held office for 10 years, committed a
major blunder by humiliating or affronting all three of her top
Cabinet colleagues.
   Some described the shakeup by Mrs. Thatcher _ who has sole power
to appoint Cabinet ministers from among her party's legislators _
as a ``shambles'' and said it reflected her increasing lack of
regard for the Cabinet.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Downing Street office took the unusual step of
announcing she supported Hurd and would have kept him in an
unspecified top job had Howe taken the job of home secretary.
   In the announcement, Mrs. Thatcher also said there will be no
more Cabinet shakeups before the next general election, which must
be held by mid-1992 but could come earlier.
   Howe, who was cheered by sympathizers when he entered the
Commons after the shuffle, hastily denied a newspaper report that
he planned to run against Mrs. Thatcher for the party leadership.
   Hurd announced that the Cabinet was united. Lawson, known to
disagree with Mrs. Thatcher on aspects of economic policy, said
nothing.
   ``The Thatcher Cabinet is now more divided than ever before .. .
not on policy, but on personality. Either they are for Mrs.
Thatcher or they are against Mrs. Thatcher,'' wrote columnist Alan
Cochrane in the pro-conservative Mail on Sunday newspaper.
   ``She is lucky the long summer recess is now upon us ... but the
summer won't last forever. And the contenders for her job won't
bide their time forever,'' he said.
   A senior aide to Mrs. Thatcher hinted that Howe was removed
because he and Lawson pressed the prime minister to be more
conciliatory about European monetary union before June's meeting of
European Economic Community leaders in Madrid.
   At the summit, she agreed in principle to link the pound to
other European currencies.
   But a dip in opinion poll ratings of the Conservative government
that began in March has turned into a persistent deficit of about
10 points behind the opposition Labor Party.
   Furor over the Cabinet shuffle has heightened fears that Mrs.
Thatcher may be an electoral liability.
   With a batch of unpopular legislation due next year, including
the sale of water and electricity industries to private enterprise,
Conservative fears are growing that Labor can't be stopped this
side of an election.

<HEAD>Parents of Slain Youths Prosecute Police In ``Trojan Horse'' Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army officer and 12 policemen
have gone on trial for murder in an unprecedented prosecution
initiated by parents of two boys shot to death in 1985 by officers
hidden in crates on an unmarked truck.
   The parents decided last year to pursue the case on their own
after the attorney general for Cape Province declined to prosecute
the policemen despite a magistrate's finding of police negligence.
   The trial that opened Tuesday in Cape Town Supreme Court is
reportedly the first murder case to proceed under a law allowing
private citizens to press a prosecution in certain instances where
the government has declined.
   The 1985 confrontation, which occurred during anti-apartheid
unrest in a mixed-race township near Cape Town, has become widely
known as the ``Trojan Horse incident'' because white police gunmen
concealed themselves in a what looked like an ordinary delivery
truck.
   Footage of the incident was shown at the time on television news
broadcasts in the United States and Britain.
   According to evidence at the inquest, an army commandant and two
senior police officers ordered the truck into the township of
Athlone expecting it to be a target for stonethrowers.
   Gunfire from the concealed policemen killed Shaun Magmoed, 16;
Michael Miranda, 11, and Jonathan Classens, 21, but the magistrate
ruled there was no evidence that any of the three were among a
handful of mixed-race youths who did throw stones.
   The officers in the crates popped out of the hiding places and
fired 39 rounds of shotgun ammunition at the crowd, according to
the evidence.
   The private prosecution was instituted by Miranda's mother and
Magmoed's father. Their lawyers are to be paid with proceeds from a
fund set up last year which has received contributions from various
overseas human rights organizations.
   Defense lawyers are being paid with public funds.
   The law providing for private prosecutions allows the defense to
ask that the prosecutors pay the defendants' entire legal costs if
the case ends in acquittal.
   At the start of Tuesday's proceedings, defense lawyers asked
that the prosecution be ordered immediately to post a deposit of
$360,000 to cover possible legal costs. The request was taken under
consideration by the judge.

   Most Western hostages in Lebanon are
believed held by factions of Hezbollah, or Party of God, a
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group that gets considerable financial
support from Iran.
   Hezbollah works closely with units of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, stationed in Lebanon since Israel's 1982 invasion, to build
influence among the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.
   The factions are believed to be closely linked and may even be
largely the same people using different cover names.
   These are the groups claiming to hold the hostages:
   _ Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, says it has Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
kidnapped March 16, 1985, and Thomas Sutherland, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, abducted June 9
of that year. Anderson has been held longest of the Western
hostages.
   It demands the release of 17 comrades jailed in Kuwait for
bombing the U.S. and French embassies in December 1983. Some of
those imprisoned are believed to be relatives of Islamic Jihad
members.
   Speculation has arisen that Islamic Jihad also kidnapped
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, who disappeared Jan. 23, 1987,
after leaving his hotel in Moslem west Beirut to negotiate for the
release of American hostages. No claim of kidnapping has been made.
   _ Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine claims to hold
three Americans kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the campus of
U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College: Robert Polhill, a
lecturer in accounting; Alann Steen, a communications teacher, and
Jesse Turner, a visiting professor of mathematics and computer
science.
   It demands the release of Palestinian and Shiite Lebanese
prisoners in Israel.
   _ The Revolutionary Justice Organization claimed responsibility
for kidnapping Americans Joseph Cicippio, acting comptroller of the
American University of Beirut, on Sept. 12, 1986, and Edward Tracy,
a self-styled writer and wanderer, on Oct. 19, 1986.
   Statements from the organization threatened the men's lives
twice in 1988 _ in retaliation for the U.S. Navy's downing of an
Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf in July and if foreign
soldiers were sent to Lebanon because of problems over the election
of a president in September. It did not say they were put to death.
   _ The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
responsibility for kidnapping Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on
Feb. 17, 1988, while he served with a U.N. truce observer force,
and said he was hanged Monday. A videotape was released, but there
was no way to determine when it was made, and no body has been
found.
   _ Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigades said it
kidnapped Frank Reed, the American director of the Lebanese
International School, on Sept. 9, 1986.
   _ Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, believed to
be a cover name for a faction of Palestinian terrorist mastermind
Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council, claimed to have abducted
Alec Collett, a British journalist on assignment for a U.N. agency.
   Collett was kidnapped March 25, 1985, and the group said April
23, 1986, that it hanged him because of British support for U.S.
air raids on Libya eight days earlier. A videotape was released,
showing a body hanging from a scaffold, but no corpse has been
found.
   _ Cells of Armed Struggle claimed to have abducted Jack Mann, a
Briton decorated as a fighter pilot in World War II, on May 12,
1989.
   Five other Westerners are missing and believed kidnapped, but no
claims of abduction have been made and nothing has been heard of
them since they disappeared.
   John McCarthy, a British journalist with the London-based World
Television News agency, was seized April 17, 1986, on th road to
the Beirut airport.
   Brian Keenan, an English language teacher at the American
University of Beirut who holds dual Irish and British nationality,
was kidnapped as he walked to work April 11, 1986.
   Alberto Molinari, an Italian businessman, was abducted Sept. 11,
1985, as he crossed Beirut's sectarian dividing line from Christian
east Beirut to the Moslem zone. He had lived in Beirut for 20 years.
   West Germans Heinrich Struebig and Thomas Kemptner, who worked
with the ASME-Humanitas relief group in Palestinian refugee camps
near Sidon in south Lebanon, disappeared May 16, 1989. No group has
claimed responsibility, but militia leaders in the area say they
are held by radical Palestinians.

   Conductor Zubin Mehta, annoyed by the noise
of latecomers, dropped the baton to his knee a few measures into
Beethoven's ``Leonore'' overture. Obediently, the Israeli
Philharmonic stopped playing.
   The Fine Arts Palace concert hall audience fell deadly silent,
but not before chiding ushers and insulting the late arrivals,
according to the government news agency Notimex.
   Five minutes later, Mehta began the concert again.
   The audience behaved for the rest of Monday's concert and Mehta
apparently forgave them. After a standing ovation, he offered an

   Eddie Murphy thinks he got a raw deal from
Paramount and a bum rap from Spike Lee.
   ``Given my personal circumstances and the success of my films,
I've got the worst deal in Hollywood,'' Murphy said in the Aug. 8
issue of Rolling Stone magazine.
   He was upset by Jack Nicholson's potential $60 million payday
for ``Batman,'' a payoff based on a percentage of the receipts and
merchandising rather than the per-film deal that Murphy signed with
Paramount Pictures.
   ``When I renegotiated my deal with Paramount a few years ago, it
seemed great,'' said Murphy. ``But nobody planned that my pictures
would be as successful as they are. So now I've got a (lousy) deal,
compared with what I could be making.''
   Murphy also said he was angered by fellow filmmaker Lee's
charges that he has failed to use his power to help other blacks in
Hollywood.
   ``I do have a social conscience, but I can't walk into a
studio's front office and demand, `Hire some black people here!'
Spike gets overanxious playing that militant-brother role and
occasionally says some stupid stuff,'' Murphy said.

   Torch singer Phyllis Hyman has taped a
public service announcement about breast exams because of a
friend's death from breast cancer and her sister's struggle with
the disease.
   Ms. Hyman, a Philadelphia native who still lives in the city,
filmed the announcement Tuesday for Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital and the Linda Creed Foundation.
   Ms. Creed, who wrote Ms. Hyman's hit ``Old Friend'' as well as
``The Greatest Love of All,'' died in 1986.
   Ms. Hyman said her friendship with the songwriter and her
sister's battle with breast cancer ``gave me a lot of strength when
I was asked to do this. I get breast exams every year, and I do
self-exams. Not as often as I should, but I do them. It's an easy
process.''
   More than 142,000 women in the United States develop breast
cancer and about 43,000 women die of the disease each year.
   The videotape will be sent to television stations in the
Philadelphia area.

   Mike Rutherford says the music and
message of his solo group, Mike and The Mechanics, is becoming more
defined and is distinctly different from Genesis, the pop group he
helped found.
   ``I feel that with each album I'm getting away from Genesis,''
said Rutherford. ``There's a lot of influences that are coming
through the Mechanics that haven't completely gotten out yet. We
are always changing.''
   Although both groups have a Top 40 sound, Rutherford sees
differences. ``I think onstage we go a little more (rhythm and
blues), and that's one of the things that takes us away from
Genesis,'' he said.
   He believes it is unfair to compare the 12-year-old Genesis and
his veteran bandmates Phil Collins and Tony Banks to the 4-year-old
Mechanics, but Rutherford said it is inevitable.
   Despite the good fortune the Mechanics have experienced, the
group still struggles while Genesis lives in the comfort that they
have fans to buy their records and attend their concerts.
   ``On one hand I can fly around the world with Genesis, and with
the Mechanics I can't make any mistakes,'' said Rutherford.

   Comedian Rodney Dangerfield honored the
Musicians' Union strike by not appearing at Bally's Hotel and
Casino.
   The hotel announced Saturday that Dangerfield was to have opened
Tuesday night despite the continuing strike, but representatives of
Musicians' Local 369 said Dangerfield had changed his mind and
agreed not to appear Aug. 1-9 as previously announced. The hotel
confirmed that Tuesday.
   The hotel announced Tuesday afternoon it was closing its
Celebrity Room, which features name stars, until the strike ends.
Singer Connie Francis had been scheduled Aug. 10-15.
   Musicians struck the Strip resort Thursday when Bally's switched
from musicians to taped music for its Jubilee production show. The
hotel agreed to continue to use musicians to back up headliners
appearing in the Celebrity Room, but the union set up pickets to
protest the switch for the Jubilee show.
   Dean Martin, scheduled to open at the Celebrity Room last week,
canceled his engagement rather than cross the picket line.
   Bally's is the only resort in Las Vegas that has a production
show and a room featuring name headliners.
   The Flamingo Hilton and the Tropicana have switched from live
music to tape for their production shows. The union has been
picketing at both resorts.

   Cuban-born state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen romped to
the Republican nomination Tuesday in the race to succeed the late
Rep. Claude Pepper, while a Cuban-born former city commissioner and
a prominent Jewish attorney headed to a Democratic runoff.
   Attorney Gerald Richman claimed momentum as he narrowly led a
seven-candidate field in the ethnically diverse district. Former
Miami city commissioner Rosario Kennedy, also Cuban-born, had been
the front-runner but was criticized for late negative campaigning.
   She ran just behind Richman, who in his stump speech said the
U.S. House slot was ``an American seat.'' Pepper's niece, Jo Ann
Pepper, fell short of the Aug. 15 runoff for the District 18 seat.
   ``It is really incredible,'' said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who was
carrying nearly every precinct with 80 percent-plus totals. ``We're
quite humbled and really flabbergasted. We really just hoped for a
victory without a runoff.''
   Elections officials said turnout was best in the Little Havana
precincts. The Aug. 29 special election to fill the seat Pepper had
held for the Democrats since 1962 could result in election of the
first Cuban-American in Congress.
   While the Democrats battle in a runoff campaign, Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen will get help from a fund-raising visit Wednesday by
Vice President Dan Quayle for the state Republican Party and she
will film a new television commercial Thursday. ``We are going to
charge ahead,'' she said. ``We don't let up for one minute.''
   In unofficial returns from all 146 precincts, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen,
36, had 16,555 votes, or 85 percent; fellow Cuban-American Carlos
Perez, 57, had 1,997 votes, or 10 percent; insurance broker David
Fleischer, 54, had 555 votes, 3 percent, and evangelist John
Stembridge, 51, had 456 votes, or 2 percent.
   In the heated Democratic race, Richman, 48, had 5,513 votes, or
28 percent, while Ms. Kennedy, 44, had 5,402 votes, or 27 percent.
Ms. Pepper, 39, had 4,757 votes, or 24 percent.
   Some 1,000 Democratic absentee ballots remained to be counted
Wednesday.
   Professor Marvin Dunn, 48, had 1,625 votes, or 8 percent; and
real estate agent Sonny Wright, 54, had 1,476 votes, or 7 percent.
They are both black.
   Businessman Bernard Anscher, 67, had 662 votes, 3 percent, and
striking Eastern Airlines pilot John Paul Rosser, 38, had 264
votes, or 1 percent. Florida hasn't elected a black congressman
since Reconstruction.

   Pepper, a liberal champion of the elderly and poor, drew no
opposition in 1988. He died May 30 at age 88, and his death left
the Republicans with a 10-8 majority in the state's congressional
delegation.
   The district includes the retirement communities of Miami Beach,
predominantly black neighborhoods such as Liberty City, heavily
Cuban neighborhoods and affluent Coral Gables.
   The elections office said the district's 100,198 registered
Democrats comprised 16,028 Hispanics, 32,183 blacks and 51,987
non-Latin whites. The 71,620 registered Republicans comprised
46,738 Hispanics, 23,656 non-Latin whites, and 1,226 blacks.
   But the figures for Hispanics are low, because the office counts
only those who were born in Hispanic nations. Unofficial estimates
that include second-generation Hispanics run to about half of the
registered voters.
   Ms. Lehtinen, an educator and conservative married to U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, led candidates in fund-raising with more
than $200,000 reported as of July 20. She avoided joint appearances
with Perez, a businessman and fervent supporter of Ronald Reagan
and Oliver North, the former National Security Council adviser who
endorsed Perez.
   Ms. Kennedy, whose former husband is David Kennedy, an ex-mayor
of Miami and one of her top political advisers, was criticized in
the campaign's final week for negative mailings aimed at Ms. Pepper
and Richman.
   She was endorsed by the AFL-CIO, The Miami Herald and state
Democratic Party chairman Simon Ferro.
   Richman, former Florida Bar Association president, was attacked
in the mailings for representing international arms dealer Sarkis
Soghanalian, indicted on charges of illegally conspiring to smuggle
combat helicopters to Iraq. Richman called Soghanalian a patriot
who has helped U.S. causes.
   Ms. Pepper, portrayed as a naive political novice by the Kennedy
forces, said she learned inside politics and government during her
frequent travels with her uncle. She said 14 years as a federal
probation officer gave her tough views on crime.

   A trucker from Delaware heading to
Rhode Island to deliver a load of rice had to make a side trip so
his wife could deliver a baby boy.
   Betty Weaver, 26, and her husband, Joe Freitus, of Dover, Del.,
were heading north on Interstate 95 Monday morning when they
stopped at a rest stop in East Lyme.
   When Freitus came out of a McDonald's, Ms. Weaver had gone into
labor. Freitus started driving again to look for a hospital.
   ``I didn't know where the first hospital was,'' she said Monday
night from Lawrence and Memorial Hospital. ``But we saw a sign for
it. Then we hoped there were no tunnels or anything.''
   After Freitus maneuvered the truck into the hospital parking
lot, Ms. Weaver walked into the hospital about 4:30 a.m. and gave
birth to Joseph Lee 15 minutes later.
   The 5-pound, 12-ounce boy, due Aug. 11, was Ms. Weaver's second
child.
   Freitus waited for the delivery and took a picture with his new
son before hopping back into his truck to make his delivery. He
planned to pick her up on his return trip.

   A raffle offering a complete wedding and
reception package drew no takers among public housing residents in
this Ohio River city.
   ``It was my bright idea that maybe we would have some young lady
who, rather than living with a fellow, would like to get married
and did not have the means,'' Evansville Housing Authority Board
member Jeanette Benton said Tuesday.
   The package, including gown, tuxedo, flowers for the wedding
party and the traditional decor, were to be given away Monday in a
raffle for more than 1,000 people living in homes owned by the
housing authority.
   Residents could obtain free tickets by filling out a form that
verified they were single. No one picked up a ticket, a
disappointed Benton said.
   Benton, who owns and operates a wedding outfitting business, got
the idea for the wedding after learning of mass weddings put on by
larger cities' federal housing programs.
   Such weddings in other cities were motivated by housing
officials who wanted to stop couples from living together as a way
of circumventing a federal requirement of reporting all household
members' incomes.
   Benton reiterated that was not her motivation, adding, ``It was
just something to give back to the community.''

   A Mississippi businessman was the paid
informant who in 1964 led the FBI to the graves of three slain
civil rights workers, according to records of a defunct
segregationist state agency.
   Olen Burrage of Philadelphia, Miss., received $30,000 from the
FBI for this information,'' records from the Sovereignty Commission
show. The records quote their own informant.
   Burrage, however, denied that he had anything to do with the
killings.
   A federal judge last week ordered the records of the commission,
which tried to thwart civil rights groups in the 1950s and 1960s,
be opened to the public. The judge later stayed his ruling pending
an appeal.
   Portions of the records are included in the personal papers of
former Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr. The complete records are in the
archives of the McCain Graduate Library at the University of
Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg. Portions were made available
to The Clarion-Ledger in an agreement with the attorney general.
   Burrage told the newspaper Monday that he had nothing to do with
the killings of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
He also denied that the FBI paid him for information.
   Burrage's attorney, Robert Thomas of Philadelphia, said his
client was tried on federal charges of conspiracy to violate the
civil rights of the three men in 1967 and acquitted.
   ``Hey, look, you can write whatever you want to,'' Burrage said
in a telephone interview with the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. ``I
didn't have nothing to do with it. I'm not going to have anything
to do with it now.
   ``I've been harassed for years and years on this mess. I don't
even want to talk to you about it,'' he said.
   Commission investigator A.L. Hopkins' search for the FBI
informant is contained in the commission's records. Hopkins is dead.
   Hopkins wrote a report on his investigation Aug. 6, 1964, two
days after the three bodies were found in a grave at the base of a
pond dam under construction on Burrage's land southwest of
Philadelphia.
   ``I have information from a confidential source ... that Mr.
Olen Burrage, a white male who owns the property where the bodies
were found, and who operates a truck line out of Philadelphia,
Mississippi, is the informant who directed the FBI to the spot,''
Hopkins said in the report.
   Joe Sullivan, who was the FBI agent in charge of the Neshoba
County investigation, said Monday that Burrage never received money
for information.
   ``I didn't pay any money to anybody,'' Sullivan said in an
interview from his New York City home. ``I certainly don't know
anything about it.''
   Sullivan said a freelance writer working on the case during the
44 days federal and state officials looked for the three had
offered a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the bodies.
   ``That was the genesis of all the talk up there,'' Sullivan
said. ``I think he was affluent enough he could have paid the
reward.
   The FBI file shows an informant led agents to the dam, but
Sullivan refused to identify the individual. ``I have never named
anybody, and I don't want to.''
   The commission was created by the Mississippi Legislature on
March 22, 1956, to preserve segregation in the state. The
commission became inactive in 1973 when then-Gov. Bill Waller
vetoed its funding. The Legislature abolished the commission and
ordered its files sealed for 50 years in 1977.

<HEAD>Leading Newspaper Chain Ends 40-Year Snub of East Germany</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since East Germany was founded 40
years ago, West Germany's largest publishing chain has snubbed its
socialist sibling by placing quotation marks around every reference
to the state.
   But starting today, Axel Springer newspapers and magazines will
end the practice that has irked authorities in East Berlin,
Springer officials said.
   The quotation marks have cost the publishing empire journalistic
accreditation in the neighboring socialist state and readership
among much of West Germany's left-leaning populace.
   But far from conceding defeat in the ideological battle, the
publishers contend the war against the division of Germany
continues.
   ``The hope for reunification is unshaken,'' Manfred Schell,
editor-in-chief of the conservative daily Die Welt wrote today.
   But, in light of changes in East-West relations, the barriers to
improving the flow of information between the political blocs must
fall, Schell said.
   The giant Springer publishing network includes Europe's
largest-circulation daily, Hamburg-based Bild Zeitung, which sells
nearly 5 million copies daily. It also includes the influential
Berliner Morgenpost and Bonn's Die Welt.
   Despite Springer's broad audience, its journalists have been
denied accreditation to work in East Germany on the grounds that
the company's editorial policies are insulting to the Berlin
government.
   A spokesman for the East German Foreign Ministry said the
government had no immediate comment on Springer's reversal.
   Schell hinted in his editorial that the newspaper considered the
dropped quotation marks a step toward gaining permission to report
from East Germany. Referring to East Germany as ``DDR,'' the German
abbreviation for Deutsche Demokratische Republik, was the protest
of the publishing chain's founder, Axel Springer, who died nearly
four years ago.
   Germany's division after World War II weighed heavily on
Springer, who moved his prospering business from his native Hamburg
to West Berlin in 1967.
   After construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, he put up a
lighted readerboard to flash news from the West across the barrier.
   Springer also issued political and moral guidelines for the
publications in 1967, and the first and foremost called for the
reunification of Germany.
   From the 1949 founding of East Germany, Springer publications
refused to acknowledge the socialist government and the quotation
marks demonstrated their disdain.
   Die Welt administrative chief Jens Lueddeke said other West
German publications also initially declined to acknowledge East
German statehood, using similar quote marks or skeptical references
to the government.
   But most dropped the practice after West Germany recognized the
east in 1970.
   Springer editors concede now that the quotation marks have now
lost their meaning and in some cases simply confuse readers.
   Circulation of Springer's main dailies has fallen by as much as
10 percent over the past few years, and many attribute the drop to
shifts within the West German populace toward detente with nations
of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``The number of people who can recall adult life in a unified
Germany is a minority,'' Die Welt editor Schell wrote.
   ``With this step we come to grips with the developments in East
and Central Europe, in particular the reform efforts in Hungary,
Poland and the Soviet Union,'' Schell said.

<HEAD>Study: Working Women Sleep Less</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Working women sleep about 25 minutes
less per night than their male counterparts, though the average
woman sleeps slightly longer than the average man, researchers said
Tuesday.
   ``Working women really take it in the neck. They sleep less,''
said Daniel Hamermesh, professor of economics at Michigan State
University and one of the authors.
   ``One possible explanation is that a woman who works still has
to maintain a lot of household duties,'' said Jeff Biddle,
assistant professor of economics at the school.
   ``They aren't spending much less time doing those things, and
their husbands aren't sharing chores with them, so the time has to
come from somewhere and often it comes from sleep time.''
   Mothers of children less than 3 years old get less sleep than
the average person, but being parents to children younger than 3
doesn't cut into the amount of sleep fathers get, Hamermesh said.
   The study of the sleep habits of 1,500 people also found that
people who work sleep less than people who don't work and that for
every extra hour worked, a person sleeps 15 minutes less.
   The more a man works, the less sleep he gets, the report said.
   Men who earn a higher wage per hour sleep less than lower-paid
men, but that pattern fails to hold up for women.
   ``One reason may be that women who are already working are
sleeping less already and so the margin is gone,'' he said.
   Hamermesh and Biddle gleaned the findings from reviewing
information gathered in 1975-76 by the University of Michigan
survey research division. In 1980-81, 620 members of the study
group were interviewed again.
   Biddle said the time lapse since the data was collected
shouldn't matter because lifestyles haven't changed significantly
since then.
   ``Lifestyles and attitudes toward money and family are pretty
much the same. Things like household habits are very slow to
change,'' he said.
   Wide variances in the amount of time people sleep were turned up
by the study. Hamermesh said 10 percent reported sleeping less than
6.5 hours a night and 10 percent reported sleeping more than 9
hours.
   ``Sleep is not something biologically fixed. People can
substitute other activities for sleep,'' Hamermesh said.
   ``Although it's true we do need a certain amount of sleep, we do
have some control,'' Biddle said. ``How much time is valued is
going to enter into that decision.''

   Jett Williams will perform her own music
with songs written by her father, country great Hank Williams, when
she begins touring with his Drifting Cowboys band.
   ``It's meant to be, because a lot of strange things have
happened,'' said Ms. Williams, who recently won a decision by the
Alabama Supreme Court recognizing she had been cut out of her
father's estate. ``I know who I am now. I know that my father
wanted me and that's taken me a whole lifetime.''
   She signed a deal Monday with Buddy Lee Attractions of Nashville
to tour with the two Drifting Cowboys who still perform, fiddler
Jerry Rivers and steel guitarist Don Helms. Tour arrangements were
incomplete.
   Ms. Williams, whose real name is Cathy Deupree Adkinson, was
born in Montgomery five days after Williams' death on Jan. 1, 1953.
Williams and her mother, Bobbie Jett, were not married, and the
child was raised by Williams' mother, Lillian Stone.
   After Mrs. Stone's death the girl was put up for adoption. The
Alabama court decided she should share Williams' songwriting
royalties with Hank Williams Jr.
   Ms. Williams, who is married to Washington attorney Keith
Adkinson, will also perform songs she has written about her own
life, including ``Conceived in Love.''

   A case of mistaken identity landed a man
in jail on his wedding day, and it took the word of the reverend
who was to preside at the service to get him out.
   Frank Padilla of Carlstadt said Tuesday he was riding with three
friends on Route 4 about 3:15 a.m. Saturday when police stopped him
at River Edge in northeastern New Jersey because his car had a
broken tail light.
   The officer checked Padilla's driver's license and found it was
expired. The officer then checked to see if Padilla had a record.
   A computer check showed a warrant for a Frank Padilla, who was
convicted in 1981 and 1986 on narcotics charges and was listed as a
parole violator. The computer listed the wanted man's birthday as
Aug. 15, 1962.
   Padilla's expired license showed the same birthday, landing him
in jail.
   He told police they'd made a mistake.
   ``They said, `That's fine, but we need proof,''' he said.
   Padilla, who described himself as a ``Bible-believing
Christian'' and said he taught emotionally disturbed children in
Edgewater, spent about 45 minutes alone in a jail cell. He said he
sang ``songs to the Lord.''
   While police checked his story, Padilla's friends rounded up
character references for him.
   The police finally accepted the word of the Rev. Tom Mahairas,
who was due to officiate at Padilla's wedding later Saturday.
   He was released about 5 a.m. on his own recognizance in lieu of
$350 bail on the suspended license charge, said Lt. Frank Starace
of the River Edge Police Department. A hearing was set for Aug. 22.
   Ten hours after his release, Padilla and Judith Thomas were
married in Hackensack.
   The bridegroom said he bore no malice toward police.
   ``The officers were very nice about the whole thing,'' Padilla
said. ``They were just doing their job.''

<HEAD>Lucas Rejected; Could Get Civil Rights Job on Interim Basis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is weighing whether
William Lucas could be named chief civil rights enforcer on an
interim basis after his rejection by the Democrat-dominated Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   The idea was raised by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
on Tuesday after Lucas' defeat in a pair of 7-7 votes that Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh labeled ``raw politics.''
   A spokesman said Thornburgh is studying whether Lucas could be
given a recess appointment to the job after Congress' scheduled
adjournment Friday.
   However, one White House official said President Bush likely
would not want to anger Congress so early in his term by defying
the Senate over Lucas, who was criticized by opponents as being
unqualified to become assistant attorney general for civil rights.
   No new names for the position are under consideration while the
legality of the recess appointment option is being explored, said
Robert S. Ross Jr., Thornburgh's executive assistant.
   Ross said Thornburgh and his top aides were surprised by the
committee's action, saying they expected the nomination would be
forwarded to the full Senate where they thought Lucas would win
confirmation.
   A recess appointment would let Lucas serve until the term of the
current Congress expires _ in 1990. The final decision on whether
to go that route would be up to Bush.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., Judiciary Committee chairman,
called the notion of a recess appointment a ``bad idea.''
   Congressional and White House sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a recess appointment would touch off a
confrontation between Bush and Congress.
   ``In terms of where we go from here, we're now exploring our
options,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who
expressed disappointment over the vote. Fitzwater said he did not
know whether Dole discussed the idea of a recess appointment with
the White House.
   ``No decisions have been made, however, about either Mr. Lucas'
future or how we might approach the job at the Justice
Department,'' he said.
   Seven of the Judiciary Committee's eight Democratic members
voted against Lucas, citing his lack of professional qualifications
to head the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., joined the panel's six GOP
members in voting for Lucas.
   The committee also rejected, on an identical vote, a motion by
Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., to send Lucas' nomination to the full
Senate without a committee recommendation.
   Opponents argue that Lucas, 61, a black Detroit Republican who
was sheriff and later chief executive of Wayne County, Mich.,
showed during his confirmation hearing that he was not familiar
with civil rights law.
   Lucas, who has never tried a court case, acknowledged during the
hearing that he was ``new to the law.''
   ``He's lacking in experience and qualifications, his managerial
accomplishments are debatable,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
who cast a crucial vote against confirmation.
   But Republicans accused Democrats of racial hypocrisy by
refusing to give Lucas a chance to gain experience in the job.
   ``By rejecting him we are preaching one civil rights philosophy
and practicing another,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
noting that Lucas would bring to the job his experience as a victim
of racial discrimination.
   But Biden retorted that ``the greatest injustice is being done
to Bill Lucas because of what I think is the apparent cynicism of
this administration.''
   ``Bill Lucas adds up to a perfect foil,'' Biden said, ``A
decent, honorable black man who has had a successful career, who
has demonstrated he knows absolutely nothing about the law. I think
that is cynicism in the extreme.''

<HEAD>Administration to Push for Greater Savings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is planning a fall
offensive to call attention to the chronically low U.S. savings
rate, with officials holding out the possibility that thrifty
Americans will be rewarded with increased tax incentives.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, aides said, will kick off the
campaign with a series of speeches outlining the risks to America's
global competitive position from low savings rates, which drive up
the cost of capital for U.S. businesses.
   The personal savings rate, savings as a percent of after-tax
income, fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and increased
only slightly to 4.2 percent last year.
   By contrast, the savings rate in Japan was 16.5 percent in 1987.
   The administration is looking at a variety of possible solutions
to the problem, ranging from broadening the tax savings offered by
Individual Retirement Accounts to eliminating the double taxation
on corporate dividends.
   The trouble is that such proposals to offer tax breaks to people
who save would mean a tax loss of billions of dollars when the
federal government is already straining to reduce huge budget
deficits.
   But officials said it was likely that the administration would
offer some changes in U.S. tax law for Congress to consider.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying Tuesday
before the Senate Banking Committee, called boosting the low U.S.
savings rate ``the crucial issue for the long-term economic outlook
of the country.''
   Economists have long warned that the low personal savings rates,
combined with the large federal budget deficits, were driving up
interest rates in the United States and making it more expensive
for U.S. businesses to borrow money needed to expand and modernize.
   Greenspan, as he has done in the past, urged Congress to make
reducing the federal budget deficit a top priority. But he said
lawmakers should also consider ways to boost personal savings to
expand the pool of available capital.
   The Fed chairman noted that between the Civil War and World War
I, America had the highest savings rate in the world, which helped
supply the capital needed to transform the country into an
industrial giant.
   While the personal savings rate had rebounded somewhat to 5.5
percent during the first six months of this year, Greenspan said
more must be done to push the rate higher.
   Greenspan said officials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury
Department and the president's Council of Economic Advisers were
studying a variety of legislative proposals to boost savings,
including the possibility of making changes in financial markets
that would favor savers.
   Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber said in an interview
that the administration had a task force reviewing the savings
issue and that one option being considered was revamping IRA
accounts, which were scaled back in the 1986 tax law.
   Also being studied, Glauber said, are ways to eliminate the tax
code inequity that makes it cheaper for corporations to borrow to
finance expansions than to issue stock.
   If a corporation raises capital by borrowing, it can deduct its
interest payments. But if it sells stock and distributes dividends
on its profits, both it and the shareholders are taxed on those
profits.
   Glauber said Brady would frame the issue in a series of speeches
this fall as part of an overall need in America to focus more on
long-term goals. He said the administration's push for a reduction
in the capital gains rate would be included as one of the changes
needed to lower the cost of capital to businesses.
   ``These are issues on which the secretary feels very strongly,''
Glauber said. ``He is going to map out an agenda in some detail and
with some coherence.''
   In a preview of the initiative two weeks ago, White House Budget
Director Richard Darman called in a speech for both public and
private belt-tightening to cut budget deficits, increase
productivity, improve the education system and make other necessary
sacrifices to ``adequately address the future.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Reprimanded Over Conflict of Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge who was reprimanded for ruling
on two General Electric Co. cases while owning GE stock said he
will institute safeguards to prevent it from happening again.
   A judicial panel determined that U.S. District Judge Thomas
Curran violated the U.S. Judicial Code of Ethics by ruling in the
cases, according to documents obtained Tuesday by The Associated
Press.
   The code requires judges to disqualify themselves from any case
in which they have a personal or financial interest.
   In a letter, William J. Bauer, chief judge of the U.S. 7th
Circuit Court of Appeals, admonished Curran to ``increase your
diligence in searching out any future possible conflicts'' but said
no other action would be taken.
   ``Because the violation, unintended as it appears, gives an
appearance of impropriety to the actions, we express our concern
that they occurred,'' said Bauer, who oversees the Milwaukee
district where Curran presides.
   Curran could have faced suspension or a recommendation that he
be impeached, but Bauer said those penalties would have been too
harsh.
   Curran's rulings in the cases where he had holdings were
reported by the AP on May 30. That report triggered the 7th Circuit
review.
   The Judicial Council is made up of the 11 active appeals judges
in the 7th Circuit and four district judges from the 7th Circuit,
which covers Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.
   Upon being notified of the conflict, Curran publicly dismissed
himself from the cases, an action that allows interested parties to
reopen the cases.
   In a letter responding to the reprimand, Curran said he ``joined
in the council's concern'' about the conflicts and ``instituted
additional procedures and safeguards designed to prevent
reoccurrence.''
   Curran wrote he reviewed documents in both cases and ``I simply
never connected up the defendant in each case with my investment.
The responsibility and blame must rest solely on my shoulders.''
   The AP discovered the conflicts by reviewing Curran's annual
financial disclosure statements and cross-referencing his stock
holdings with his case files.
   The AP review showed Curran has reported each year since 1985
that he has held between $15,000 and $50,000 in GE stock. He
presided over unrelated cases involving GE Medical Systems in 1987
and 1989. In both cases, he ruled in favor of GE.
   In the Eastern District of Wisconsin based in Milwaukee, lawyers
are required to file a certificate identifying all interests in the
case. Judges must then review that certificate and compare it
against their financial records to make sure they do not have an
interest.
   In one of the two GE Medical Systems cases, Curran said a
certificate of interest was not filed by either the defendant or
plaintiff.
   Curran, 64, was appointed to the bench in 1983 by former
President Reagan. His 1988 disclosure statement showed net
investments between $648,030 and $1,740,000, generally in blue-chip
stocks. His investments returned between $37,147 and $112,116 in
1988, including between $1,001 and $2,500 in GE dividends.

<TEXT>
   For Jim Wright, veteran speaker of the House,
it was his tryout to be speaker _ with a small ``s.''
   Wright, who resigned from Congress two months ago under an
ethics cloud, found himself sharing billing Tuesday night with a
comic juggler, a magician, Jack Benny's daughter and a professional
cat trainer.
   Such are the perils for the Texas Democrat who, after a few
weeks of rest from the trauma of his resignation, is setting out on
the lecture trail.
   Wright's first stop was the annual convention of the
International Platform Association, an organization of program
organizers and talent bookers who arrange speakers and
entertainment for colleges, corporations and trade groups.
   IPA officials describe their forum as similar to the National
Basketball Association draft, where the best talent is shown off
and shopped around. To an outside observer, it more resembles a
meat market.
   Speakers at the convention in a downtown Washington hotel all
have the same idea, says IPA chairman Dan Tyler Moore.
   ``They have something to say, and they want to be paid a buck
for saying it.''
   Wright's message was a simple one: the honor of politics as a
profession, and of Congress, where he served for 34 years, in
particular.
   The 25-minute talk was punctuated with anecdotes about life on
Capitol Hill, including Wright's account of his well-meaning
attempt to help a would-be Texas bride get a 48-hour leave for her
serviceman fiance so the two could be married.
   He received a telegram of effusive thanks from the woman, and
one from the groom that said: ``Why don't you mind your own damn
business?''
   The IPA, after sitting through days of speeches and acts, is a
tough audience.
   Several of the professional critics said Wright needed to punch
up his routine a bit, perhaps adopting a more controversial topic.
Others said he was better than expected _ for a politician.
   ``I think he'd be popular,'' said Fred Antil of Cornell
University. ``He's got insight into something we are all curious
about. He had good emotion, use of quotations, range.''
   But Richard L. Mellott of Lorain County Community College near
Cleveland, Ohio, said he'd be reluctant to book Wright because of
the ethics controversy that forced him from office.
   ``He's going to be like Ollie North. He'll be big in the
corporate world and the redneck world where they wave the American
flag a lot,'' Mellot said.
   Another veteran conventioneer said Wright will be ``good for a
few months because he's still sort of a hot item, but it won't take
long for the star to fade.''
   Wright said his asking price will be $10,000 a speech, near the
bottom of the range for top speakers these days, but five times the
maximum he was allowed to accept for a speech while a member of
Congress.
   Former President Reagan is getting upwards of $50,000 per
appearance, and North, convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, is
paid a reported $25,000 per speech.
   Wright said his goal in starting a new career as a public
speaker is ``to help people understand Congress a little bit better
and to awaken an interest in young people in public service.''
   ``I'd like to overcome, to the degree possible, the cynicism
that exists.''
   Wright resigned after the House ethics committee charged him
with 69 ethics violations, including allegedly using bulk sales of
his book to evade limits on outside income, and improperly taking
gifts from a developer friend who had a direct interest in
legislation. Wright contended he was innocent of the charges.

<TEXT>
   An Energy Department report on the
government's nuclear weapons program describes a pattern of shoddy
waste management and hazardous conditions with contamination of
ground water or soil at many plants.
   The findings were included in a detailed assessment Tuesday on
what it will take to clean up the nuclear weapons plants after
decades of environmental neglect by plant operators.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said the first phase of the
cleanup effort will cost $19.5 billion over the next five years
with the overall cleanup likely to take at least 30 years. Overall
cost estimates range from $90 billion to as much as $150 billion.
   The department's report listed numerous cases where shoddy
handling of hazardous waste has contaminated ground water, posing
various degrees of risk to surrounding communities.
   For example, according to the report:
   _At the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, ``surface and ground
water contamination'' was blamed on abandoned waste storage tanks.
Some public surface water was found to be contaminated and further
``potential health risks exist.''
   _Soil and ground water was found contaminated at the Savannah
River uranium processing plant near Aiken, S.C., where wastes are
buried in unlined pits and lagoons. Some of the contaminated
wastewater has been discharged into streams.
   _Uranium dust has contaminated water at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory where spent nuclear fuel is recycled. The
report also warned of an ``immediate risk to employees through
exposure to contaminated drinking water'' and said radiation
exposure ``is a potential health risk'' to nearby property.
   _Ground water also was cited at the Hanford nuclear reservation
in eastern Washington state, where particular concern was noted
because of the facility's proximity to the Columbia River.
   _Among other priorities was reducing ground water contamination
at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, Calif.,
and digging up barrels of liquid chemical waste at the Nevada Test
Site north of Las Vegas.
   The report said ground water contaminants must be reduced at
other federal nuclear facilities including the Welden Springs
nuclear site in Missouri; the Fernald uranium processing plant in
Ohio; the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in Colorado; and
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
   At Los Alamos, ``untreated liquid ... were sometimes discharged
(into) canyons'' and radioactive wastes stored in various pits,
trenches and shafts. As yet, the health risk of those actions
``cannot be quantified,'' the report said.
   Watkins outlined the department's proposed cleanup effort in a
speech Tuesday to the National Press Club.
   He acknowledged ``the cost will be high'' and said even an
optimistic timetable ``passes much of the burden to the next
generation.''
   The plan, which must be approved by Congress, calls for spending
$2.4 billion next fiscal year. After that the annual bill is
expected to steadily increase, peaking at more than $4 billion in
both fiscal 1994 and 1995.
   The money would be used to clean up pollution where federal and
state safety laws are violated, repair faulty equipment and develop
new procedures and technology for future waste disposal, the
department said.
   Most of the $19.5 billion will be used at 17 nuclear weapons
plants in a dozen states as well as other nuclear facilities, most
of which are inactive but continue to have hazardous waste problems.
   Among the sites considered most contaminated and getting the
largest share of the cleanup money are: the Hanford nuclear complex
in Washington state, $4 billion; the Savannah River facility near
Aiken, S.C., $3.4 billion; the Oak Ridge Reservation complex in
Tennessee, more than $2.7 billion; and the Idaho National Energy
Laboratory, nearly $2.2 billion.
   Meanwhile, Environmental Protection Agency officials Jonathan Z.
Cannon and Richard E. Sanderson criticized the plan, saying it
``provides for tradeoffs among compliance-related activities''
rather than a commitment to doing everything necessary to clean up
the plants.

<HEAD>Branstad to Press for Change on Education, Environment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new chairman of the National Governors'
Association said he will press the states' chief executives to
reach a ``consensus for change'' on education and the environment.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad outlined his goals at the end of a
four-day meeting of the nation's governors Tuesday that produced
few disagreements and a date to meet again late next month with
President Bush for a domestic summit on education.
   Reflecting the quiet harmony of the conference, the governors
unanimously approved a resolution urging Congress and the president
to impose a two-year moratorium on expansions in the Medicaid
program that states would be required to finance.
   It also asks Congress and the Bush administration to consider
restructuring the entire health care system, ``including
federalization of Medicaid.'' States and the federal government
currently share Medicaid costs, with the program administered by
the individual states.
   Branstad, a Republican who was named to a one-year term as
chairman to replace Democrat Gerald Baliles of Virginia, said he
would make the environment and education the focus of coming
meetings of governors.
   ``We cannot accept a future of declines in education and
degradation of the environment,'' Branstad said. ``Governors can be
the facilitators to bring about a consensus for change.''
   Branstad said South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, a
Republican, and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, will head
the governors' preparations for the education meeting with Bush. No
site has been selected.
   Several governors voiced support for expanding health care
coverage to more poor Americans, but said federal requirements that
states pay for it were consuming their budgets.
   ``We don't think it's fair for Congress to take credit for doing
things and then submit the bill to the states and say, `You raise
taxes to do it,''' Branstad said. ``We think the people that are
going to be requiring things to happen also ought to show how it's
going to be paid for. That's responsible.''
   Central to the governors' complaint is their argument that
actions by Congress requiring expanded Medicaid coverage for more
people and for wider types of health care have forced states to pay
most or all of the costs.
   The governors said that if current growth in Medicaid continues,
spending by all states on the program will grow from $41 billion in
1986 to $104 billion by 1994. Medicaid, under these projections,
will have grown from 6 percent of total state budgets to nearly 16
percent by that date.
   ``All these are worthwhile programs, but if we let this trend
continue we're not going to have a budget to deal with,'' said
Democratic Gov. James Blanchard of Michigan.
   The governors approved a series of other policy statements, few
generating debate. Among them was a cautiously worded one urging
the federal government to reduce the deficit without raising taxes
``if possible,'' while protecting key domestic spending and
imposing a selective spending freeze _ in line with Bush
administration policy.
   Meeting in private, the Democratic Governors' Association
elected Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste as its new president, when
Clinton's term ends in January.
   The full governors conference elected Democrat Booth Gardner of
Washington as vice chairman, putting him in line to follow Branstad
as chairman next year.

<HEAD>USDA Report Shows Profits Rose Despite Drought But Fewer Gain</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Average farm profits showed a modest increase
last year despite the drought but fewer farms posted profits,
according to a new study by the Department of Agriculture.
   ``Farmers depending on crop sales as a major source of farm
income who incurred expenses for production and later were left
with complete crop failure or severely reduced yields had lower
profits or greater losses,'' the report said.
   ``Livestock producers within drought-plagued areas also were
hurt, mostly by higher feed costs,'' according to the report issued
this week. ``At the opposite extreme, producers managing to harvest
crops or having large inventories benefited from higher market
prices.''
   According to the USDA study, the average net farm income
increased by about $350, to $21,300, last year, marking a 1.5
percent increase over 1987.
   ``Average net farm income (profits) rose in 1988, despite the
drought,'' the report said. ``However, the share of farms with
negative income increased slightly from that of 1987.''
   The USDA credited higher earnings from crop and livestock sales
for raising gross farm income ``despite lower direct government
payments, more loan redemptions from the Commodity Credit Corp.,
and fewer net additions to crop and livestock inventories.''
   Average expenses also rose, but not enough to override the
expansion in gross farm income.
   Fewer farms were profitable in 1988 than 1987, the report said,
noting that three out of four farms represented in the Farm Costs
and Returns Survey were profitable last year.
   ``More than half of all farms (53 percent) had positive net cash
farm income in 1988, which was identical to that of 1986 but down 4
percentage points from that of 1987,'' the report said.
   Cash income in 1988 averaged $17,400, up $500 from 1987.
   Net farm income measures the longer term earnings of a farm
business and is the difference between gross farm income and total
expenses. Over time, this income measure shows the farm's ability
to survive as a viable business.
   Net cash farm income measures the short-term cash earnings of a
business and does not account for capital consumed in the
production process. It shows whether the farm is covering all cash
costs, such as interest, income taxes and principal payments.
   The report said fewer farms had relatively high levels of debt
compared with assets, with 48 percent showing no outstanding
liabilities at the end of 1988. That figure was 39.5 percent in
1984.
   ``Higher asset values, thanks to increases in land values and
coupled with continuing efforts by farmers to avoid debt financing
and reduce current debt lives, have resulted in a stronger solvency
position for farmers,'' the report said.

   A Cuban-born conservative easily won the Republican
nomination for the House seat of the late Claude Pepper and looked
forward to building up her campaign war chest while two Democrats
face a tough runoff.
   ``I think the bloody fight is going to be between the Democrats.
We're sailing on,'' said state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who won 85
percent of the GOP primary vote Tuesday against three opponents in
a bid to become the first Cuban-American in Congress.
   Meanwhile, prominent attorney Gerald Richman claimed momentum
heading into the Aug. 15 Democratic runoff as he edged Rosario
Kennedy, also Cuban-born. Jo Ann Pepper, niece of the liberal
champion of the poor and elderly who had represented the diverse
district since 1962, finished third.
   The Richman-Kennedy runoff promised to add ethnic rivalry to the
heated competition for the district, which includes the heavily
Cuban-American Little Havana area.
   ``My whole theme has been to unite the community,'' Richman
said. ``This should be an American seat, with people voting for the
most qualified candidate.''
   ``I am a Cuban-American,'' said Ms. Kennedy, a former city
commissioner. ``I'm also a woman. And I have represented all of the
people of the city of Miami.''
   In unofficial returns from all 146 precincts, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen,
36, had 16,952 votes, or 83 percent; fellow Cuban-American Carlos
Perez, 57, had 2,261 votes, or 11 percent; insurance broker David
Fleischer, 54, had 698 votes, 3 percent, and evangelist John
Stembridge, 51, had 571 votes, or 3 percent.
   In the Democratic race, Richman, 48, had 5,853 votes, or 28
percent, while Ms. Kennedy, 44, had 5,707 votes, or 27 percent. Ms.
Pepper, 39, had 5,097 votes, or 24 percent. Four other candidates
ran well behind.
   Richman, who is Jewish, hoped to pick up the support of Ms.
Pepper, who carried predominantly black precincts. Richman
dominated in predominantly Jewish Miami Beach and Ms. Kennedy won
strong support in Hispanic precincts.
   The elections office said the district's 100,198 registered
Democrats comprised 16,028 Hispanics, 32,183 blacks and 51,987
non-Latin whites. The 71,620 registered Republicans comprised
46,738 Hispanics, 23,656 non-Latin whites, and 1,226 blacks.
   The figures for Hispanics count only those born in Hispanic
nations. Unofficial estimates that include second-generation
Hispanics run to about half of the registered voters.
   Richman was angered by Ms. Kennedy's mailings that attacked him
for representing arms dealer Sarkis Soghanalian, indicted on
charges of illegally conspiring to smuggle combat helicopters to
Iraq. Richman called Soghanalian a patriot who has helped U.S.
causes.
   ``There has been some nasty negative campaigning that had me
extremely upset,'' he said, but he added that his campaign, which
started low in the polls, ``clearly has gained the momentum.''
   Ms. Kennedy said she wasn't worried about Richman's late rush,
saying the former Florida Bar Association president outspent her at
the end on television and radio.
   Republicans were delighted at the nomination of Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen, an educator who is married to U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen.
   ``I'm particularly grateful that the primary campaign was one
that did not open wounds among Republicans,'' said Guy Vander Jagt,
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen will get help from a fund-raising visit today
by Vice President Dan Quayle for the state Republican Party. She
led candidates in primary fund-raising with more than $200,000
reported as of July 20.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Chairman Says Agriculture Department Overreacted</HEAD>

   The Democratic chairman of a House agriculture
subcommittee describes the government's cancellation of some farm
export projects as an overreaction, saying the program has been
handled like a covert operation.
   ``It's almost operated like a Defense Department operation,''
Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said about the Export Enhancement
Program. ``I don't want a stealth EEP.''
   The Agriculture Department, citing congressional leaks of
sensitive information, said Tuesday that all projects approved but
not announced under the EEP have been canceled.
   ``A list of proposals that had been approved but not announced
was made public by members of Congress yesterday (Monday) in a
hearing. This information is market sensitive and was not
authorized for release,'' Richard Crowder, undersecretary for the
USDA's International Affairs and Commodity Programs, said in a
statement.
   The export subsidy program has operated since 1985 to make U.S.
commodities competitive in targeted markets where foreign
competitors _ especially the European Economic Community _ intrude
with subsidized sales of their own.
   About 65 countries, including the Soviet Union and China, have
been designated for subsidized sales.
   Under the program, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities
at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or
subsidies.
   The Agriculture Department and the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, told a House agriculture
subcommittee Monday that the program has succeeded in boosting farm
exports.
   In response to questions by subcommittee members, the GAO gave
the panel a list of export subsidy proposals, some of which had not
been announced.
   The list, which was classified, could enable foreign competitors
to seek out the intended buyers of U.S. goods overseas and offer
better deals, an official said.
   ``If information is released prior to the announcement of a
decision, then the effectiveness of the program dissipates and the
ultimate cost is borne by U.S. farmers by making it more difficult
to compete in markets abroad,'' Crowder said.
   Glickman, chairman of the subcommittee, said in an interview
that ``the GAO voluntarily handed over the document to us. It
became a public document.''
   ``He is overreacting,'' Glickman said of Crowder. ``He's also
inexperienced. But he is an honest, decent guy.''
   Glickman, who said he planned to meet Friday with Crowder, sent
a letter acknowledging that the incident was ``unfortunate'' and
``shouldn't have happended.''
   Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa, said the incident began when he asked
Crowder if the Soviet Union was interested in buying soybean oil
from the United States. Crowder said he didn't know and asked the
GAO, which led to the distribution of the sheets that included
rejected projects.
   ``Obviously he (Crowder) doesn't want this list out,'' Nagle
said. ``They don't want to admit they haven't been taking advantage
of sales opportunities and have been rejecting programs.''
   Nagle said the papers showed rejections to the Dominican
Republic for 200,000 tons of wheat, Venezuela for 700,000 tons of
wheat, Brazil for 500,000 tons of wheat and to Israel for 16,000
tons of rice.
   But Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., an agriculture committee member
who was not at Monday's hearing, blamed Nagle and said the
Agriculture Department had no choice but to cancel the EEP projects.
   ``It is hard to quarrel with what they have done because it
could have adverse effects on the market,'' he said. ``It is
incumbent on the members to be a little more sensitive to tossing
this information around.''

   Foreign ministers hoping to clear a path to peace
in Cambodia went home after a ringing round of speeches, leaving
deputies to hack through almost impenetrable underbrush.
   Even if four disparate Cambodia factions reach an accord,
allowing internationally supervised steps toward reconstruction,
good intention must stand the test of political reality.
   ``A lot of delegates express optimism, but I don't think very
many of them are optimistic,'' a Japanese official said before a
month of committee work began Tuesday.
   The crucial obstacle is what to do about the Khmer Rouge, no
mere negotiating point to any Cambodian who left his family on the
killing fields.
   Front-page cartoons in the Paris daily Le Monde keep fresh the
memory of Pol Pot's regime of the 1970s, in which at least 300,000
people were executed or starved in class purges.
   Tuesday's drawing showed one Cambodian telling others: ``I
propose we forget our little differences.'' They sat at a table
engulfed by a vast sea of skulls.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan sat impassively in the hall,
taking his turn at the rostrum to denounce subsequent Vietnamese
crimes in Cambodia as equal to Adolf Hitler's.
   Speaker after speaker rejected any Khmer Rouge role in
Cambodia's long-term future, but aides acknowledged privately it
was not likely the Khmer Rouge would go away.
   Even U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III endorsed Khmer
Rouge participation in a transitory coalition, regarding that as a
necessary evil to remove Vietnam from the scene.
   Vietnam's role was another imponderable.
   Vietnamese authorities pledged to evacuate their last troops by
Sept. 27, whatever the 19-nation Paris conference decided in
month-long deliberations.
   ``Will the Vietnamese really get out, even if they remove their
troops?'' reflected Lek Hor Tan, a Cambodian historian who helps
edit the London-based Index on Censorship. ``I don't believe it. We
have jungles, sanctuaries.''
   Other expert observers disagreed with Lek. Vietnam's lingering
presence would be noted, endangering its basic purpose of improving
its international image and attracting more aid.
   Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach assured goodwill,
mugging for reporters in a surreal counterpoint to the grim
business at hand.
   He said his Chinese colleague was cordial, modifying Beijing's
harsh tone toward Vietnam. ``We shook hands,'' he said. ``Did we
look at each other and go like this?'' He closed his eyes and stuck
out his tongue. ``No, no.''
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk occupied a pivotal role at the
conference, as he has since his neutralist government crumbled two
decades ago after the Vietnam War spilled across his borders.
   Flitting between China and France, he has rallied support for
his embattled nation, held together by a rich ancient culture that
has absorbed and then shrugged off foreign intrusion throughout
history.
   Still, his popularity is not boundless. Many Cambodians remember
his reign as tainted by profligate relatives of the colorful prince
who, they say, played the saxophone while Cambodia burned.
   Some Cambodian experts see a likely compromise, if any is
forged, will be a symbolic role for Sihanouk under a government
sympathetic to Vietnam with the Khmer Rouge making war at the edges.
   As the conference shifted into grinding low gear, Western and
Cambodian analysts agreed that one of the few concrete results was
a backhand byproduct:
   In the past few months, Hun Sen, the Cambodian prime minister
who was widely spurned as a puppet of Hanoi, has been tacitly
legitimatized as leader of Cambodia.
   He is in a position to hold power while waiting for support to
wane for Sihanouk and for Son Sann, a pro-Western resistance leader
in tenuous control of his forces.
   Despite the obstacles, most of the world is anxious to press for
some sort of settlement.
   The United States and the Soviet Union see it as a costly,
dangerous flashpoint in a world with enough problems. Japan wants
to rebuild Cambodia but cannot without a stable internal framework.
   And the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations have been trying for a decade to get Vietnam to go home and
allow the Cambodians to find some level of co-existence.
   Outside nations hope a thaw in Phnom Penh will melt away
settlements of 300,000 refugees along the Thai border, not only a
human tragedy but also a political tinderbox.
   Beyond the internal issues at the heart of the Cambodian
problem, nations differ over the international structure to
supervise the peace. Some insist that Cambodians should resolve
their own problems at their own pace.
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark, among others, argued that
the international effort has to be part of a comprehensive
settlement, including agreement among the Cambodians. ``There has
to be a peace to keep,'' he said.
   He added what many Cambodian experts considered to be a
understatement: This will be the most complex peacekeeping
operation since the Congo.

   Hungary says it is risking social
unrest, rising unemployment and a possible backlash from the
conservative right in its push toward a free-market economy.
   The government, in a memo Tuesday to a 24-nation conference on
aid to Poland and Hungary, said it is determined to change its
state-controlled economy ``even if it initially causes social
conflicts.''
   Hungary warned, however, of widespread opposition if its
campaign resulted in a sharp and sustained fall in the standard of
living of the country's 11 million people.
   It urged more than 130 officials attending the meeting at the
headquarters of the European Community for financial aid. Hungary's
foreign debt is about $18 billion, the highest per capita in
Eastern Europe.
   The memo said the government was seeking as much as $3 billion
in new Western assistance from 1990 to 1992.
   President Bush and other key world leaders called for the
meeting to draw up a Western aid package that would encourage
democratic change and economic reforms in Poland and Hungary.
   They also urged emergency food shipments for Poland.
   At the one-day talks, the United States pledged an additional
$50 million in food aid to Poland, beginning Oct. 1, to help ease
the shortages caused by that government's moves toward a
free-market economy.
   ``We're trying to help carry them through this period,'' Curtis
Kamman, deputy assistant U.S. Secretary of State for European
Affairs, told reporters.
   Austria and Switzerland also promised food aid. The European
Community, the 12-nation trading bloc, earlier agreed to send $120
million worth of meat, grains and other products to Poland.
   Shortly after Bush's trip last month to Warsaw, the United
States announced it would send $9 million in food from surplus
stocks.
   Poland on Tuesday ended price controls and meat rationing as
part of the current economic reforms. There was concern the abrupt
lifting of price controls might send the country into turmoil.
   Hungary, a founding member of the Warsaw Pact, has been in the
forefront of economic reforms in the Communist bloc since the
1960s. The push has recently accelerated.
   The government's memo said the key goal was for Hungary to
become ``an equal member of the community of the developed
democratic nations.''
   To do so, it wants to create a market economy ``based on the
equality of the different forms of ownership'' and integrated in
the world economy with a currency that can be traded
internationally.
   Hungary's currency, like those of other East bloc nations, does
not circulate in world currency markets.
   ``Parallel with our efforts aimed at creation of the market
economy, economic policy must also be radically changed,'' the memo
said.
   The reforms, it said, require tight monetary and budget policies
that can lead to poor economic growth and higher inflation.
   Hungary said its balance of payments _ a summing up of
international trade payments _ was expected to ``deteriorate'' in
1989. Moreover, it forecast a higher jobless rate due partly to
shutdowns of money-losing companies.
   ``Although unemployment is not yet considerable, its rate is
gradually growing,'' it said, cautioning it could lead ``to serious
problems in certain regions.''
   It invited the nations attending the aid conference to meet in
Budapest next month to take a closer look at Hungary's situation.
   Nations at the meeting were the European Community members of
Britain, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal.
   Others present were the United States, Canada, Australia,
Turkey, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria,
Norway and Iceland.

<HEAD>Health Official Says Congress Responsible for Providing AIDS Funding</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress must share the responsibility in the
battle against AIDS by appropriating money for all the programs it
says must be implemented, a federal health official says.
   Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health at the
Department of Health and Human Services, said Congress often fails
to provide additional money to pay for programs it authorizes.
   ``We have been getting very clear guidance except when we get an
authorization without an appropriation,'' Mason told a House
oversight subcommittee grilling him Tuesday about spending on AIDS
treatment.
   ``It would be helpful if you folks would provide leadership,''
shot back Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the department won't get a
larger share of limited federal funds ``unless the department is
going to squeak a lot louder.''
   Weiss and Pelosi represent the two cities _ New York and San
Francisco _ with the largest AIDS populations.
   Mason, who headed the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
before being selected by Bush for the No. 2 HHS job, said he shares
responsibility for the entire Public Health Service budget, which
includes the CDC, National Institutes of Health and the Food and
Drug Administration.
   ``What is enough (for AIDS)?'' he asked rhetorically. ``We can't
drop infant mortality or cancer. We could drop any other of these
and do more on AIDS but I don't think that is what the nation wants
us to do.''
   Moreover, he said, there are problems even within the AIDS
appropriations provided by Congress.
   For example, Mason said Congress authorized $15 million last
fall to help pay for AZT administered to patients who couldn't
afford it during the current fiscal year. AZT, which costs several
thousand dollars a year per patient, is the only approved drug
treatment for AIDS.
   However, the authorization didn't carry with it a new
appropriation to replace the appropriation that had been used up,
leaving HHS officials with the choice of ignoring Congress'
directive to continue paying for the drug or dipping into other
AIDS budget accounts to come up with the $15 million.
   Mason said he was facing the same problem that his predecessor
did because the HHS budget approved by the House Appropriations
Committee contains about $1.6 billion for AIDS, but nothing to
specifically cover the $30 million authorized for AZT payments
during the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
   ``The only place I can find that is to take it out of prevention
or biomedical research,'' Mason said. ``Someone has to make a
priority decision.''
   The human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee
of the House Committee on Government Operations, which held
Tuesday's hearing, doesn't have jurisdiction of legislation either
authorizing HHS programs or appropriating money for them.

<HEAD>Aquino Signs Bill Giving Greater Autonomy to Moslem Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino has signed a
bill granting regional autonomy for Mindanao island, a law the
government claims fulfills its pledge for self-rule in largely
Moslem areas of the country.
   ``We have kept the faith with the constitution,'' Mrs. Aquino
said. ``To be meaningful, autonomy must translate into the more
effective delivery of government services.''
   Under the measure, the autonomous region will have its own
governor and legislature and will have control over regional
affairs except for national defense, foreign relations, judiciary,
postal and customs.
   Rep. Wilfredo Cainglet, one of the bill's sponsors, said voters
in each of Mindanao's province will be asked in a plebiscite within
90 to 120 days whether they want to join the autonomous region.
   Provinces will be included in the area only if a majority of the
voters agree, he said.
   The new Philippine Constitution provides for autonomy for
``Moslem Mindanao,'' although most of the island's population is
Christian.
   Moslem rebels have rejected the government's proposal because it
allegedly does not go far enough in the self-rule formula.
   Moslems make up about 5 percent of the country's 58 million
people.

<HEAD>Bennett's Drug Strategy Short on Specifics, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar William J. Bennett's national drug
strategy calls for increased law enforcement but is short on
specifics, according to administration officials who have seen it.
   While the program focuses on cocaine, particularly crack, it has
``virtually nothing'' on heroin, dangerous prescription drugs that
are diverted to illegal use or hallucinogens, said one source.
   ``There's only one sentence on all of that,'' the source said
Tuesday.
   The strategy report to the Cabinet, required by the 1988
anti-drug law that created the Office of National Drug Control
Strategy, strongly reflects public comments made by Bennett since
he took office five months ago.
   The final report is due Sept. 5.
   ``It reads like one of his speeches,'' said one source.
   Another source said Bennett wrote the strategy himself after
gathering information from government agencies and drug experts.
All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The strategy calls for an all-out effort to eradicate domestic
marijuana crops and to wipe out money-laundering operations, but it
says nothing about domestic methamphetamine labs, one source said.
   However, the source said there were few specific goals _ such as
the number of drug-treatment beds the nation should have by 1991 _
in the draft submitted Monday.
   The only goals included were that drug-related admissions to
emergency rooms and the drug use found by the National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse should be reduced by 10 percent in two years
and by 50 percent in 10 years, according to one of the sources.
   Bennett warned last week that the strategy would contain ``some
carrots and some sticks.
   ``We will expect states to do certain things if they want
federal funds,'' he said then. ``We will expect educational
institutions to finally do certain things if they want education
funds.''
   In the most recent draft, those threats take the form of a
possible loss of highway funds for states that fail to revoke
driver's licenses from those convicted of drug offenses, and a
possible loss of federal education funds from schools that fail to
have Education Department approved drug-prevention programs and
policies, a source said.
   Threats in an earlier draft to revoke criminal justice funds
were eliminated, the source said.
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., who spent eight
years pushing for creation of the job, said during Bennett's
confirmation hearing that he expected the strategy to include
detailed goals.
   One source said Bennett planned to meet with senators in the
next few days, possibly to reduce expectations.
   The strategy seen by the sources did not include matters such as
international operations and interdiction efforts, which are
included in a separate, classified document being reviewed by the
National Security Council.
   The non-classified strategy, under review by the Domestic Policy
Council, reflects Bennett's oft-stated contention that the drug war
must be aggressively fought on all fronts _ enforcement, prevention
and treatment.
   ``No single strategy, pursued alone or to the detriment of other
possible and valuable initiatives, can work to contain or reduce
drug use,'' the strategy says.
   But what that means in terms of money was not immediately clear.
The draft strategy circulated Monday included no budget figures.
   Bennett said in June that he expected to seek more money for
drug treatment and probably more for prevention. He said last week
that the escalating cost of the drug war may eventually lead to the
need for a tax increase.
   The strategy stresses a need to rid inner cities of illegal
drugs.
   ``A paramount target of law-enforcement activity, especially at
the local level, must be the disruption of those street markets for
drugs in which retail demand and supply finally meet in a
combustible mix.''
   It includes proposed anti-drug legislation for states that
closely resembles outlines Bennett provided two weeks ago to a
gathering of state legislators, according to one source.
   The policies Bennett urged on the state legislators ranged from
hiring more police, judges and prosecutors and building more
prisons, to imposing civil fines of up to $10,000 for those
convicted of possessing small amounts of drugs.

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended lower against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended
with a marginal gain after erasing most of its early upward
momentum.
   The dollar ended at 136.20 yen, down 0.45 yen from Tuesday's
136.65 yen. It started lower at 135.58 yen and moved between 135.50
yen and 136.30 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose just 0.88
point, or 0.003 percent, ending at 34,899.34 after it surpassed the
35,000 mark for the first time at the end of morning trading.
   Dealers attributed the index's fall from the 35,000 mark to
profit-taking and directionless afternoon trading.
   In currency dealings, the dollar in Tokyo opened sharply lower
following its plunges on overseas markets overnight, traders said.
   Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said
dealings in Tokyo were mixed with selling for position adjustment
and buying by foreign investors who will sell it later when the
dollar goes up.
   ``The dollar has been falling as market players became reluctant
to buy it because of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's move to relax
monetary policy,'' she said, ``But it's no longer a strong
market-affecting incentive because it's already been taken for
granted.''
   Ms. Takeuchi said the dollar is unlikely to fall further,
because investors are no longer selling it only based on the U.S.
interest rate cuts and relaxation of monetary policy.
   ``Currently, the market is concerned about the U.S. unemployment
rate Friday as another indicator of U.S. economic growth,'' she
said.
   The U.S. Department of Commerce is to release the nation's July
jobless rate Friday in Washington.

   Congress is being warned not to bet the farm
on high-definition television.
   Despite what its proponents say about the dazzling new
technology, HDTV won't play a significant role in a growing
electronics market in the next 20 years, according to a
Congressional Budget Office report Tuesday.
   The report, which may take some of the wind out of the HDTV
sails in Congress, said:
   _HDTV advocates have made ``very optimistic'' forecasts about
the market size and easy availability of the next generation of
video.
   _Even under the rosiest of scenarios, HDTV sales will be small
relative to other electronic equipment markets.
   _It is questionable how quickly _ or if _ finicky consumers will
accept HDTV, even though it promises 35mm motion picture quality
images, particularly if there are intermediate and cheaper types of
advanced TV receivers available.
   _The total world market for electronic equipment grew by $54
billion in 1988 to reach $461 billion, and the world market for
HDTV receivers and VCRs is forecast to be less than $30 billion by
2010.
   _HDTV will spur only marginal production of sophisticated memory
chips, which are widely used in other applications even now.
   ``It seems counterintuitive to suggest that such a small market
that may exist in the future is a more important driver of
economies of scale, technology and competitive success than is the
growth in the present market.'' the report said.
   ``It would be a case of the tail wagging the dog.''
   But the report, written by Philip C. Webre, said government
support of HDTV might be justified because of increased employment,
national prestige or scientific advancement.
   The report was introduced at a hearing of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which is considering a possible
government role in fostering the growth of a U.S. high-definition
TV industry.
   Proponents say a quick government decision is vital in
overcoming the Japanese and European lead in the HDTV arena.
   Committee Chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the United States
needs to pre-empt foreign competition so HDTV won't become another
U.S.-invented product that is sold back to Americans from overseas.
   Despite the report, the HDTV juggernaut rolled along Tuesday on
several congressional fronts.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee gave
voice vote approval to a $305 million authorization bill for the
Commerce Department's new Technology Administration in fiscal 1990
that includes $37.5 million for federal HDTV research and seed
money for private HDTV consortia.
   The bill was amended to allow foreign companies to participate
in the HDTV research consortia and a provision for $50 million in
loan guarantees was dropped.
   Also, a House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee
approved an amendment to the technology authorization bill to
provide $100 million annually for three years for creating
public-private consortia for HDTV development.
   Peter McCloskey, president of the Electronic Industries
Association, applauded the CBO report, saying it would help shift
the discussion of U.S. competitiveness away from just HDTV to ``the
need to find solutions for major economy-wide problems of primary
importance to national competitiveness.''
   Tom Long, representing the American Electronics Association,
said the report was narrowly focused on HDTV's potential use in
home TV receivers.
   HDTV, he said, would be a far more important technology driver
in engineering work stations and high-end personal computers and
for development of better manufacturing techniques.
   The association has proposed a package of federal support for
HDTV that would include $1 billion in loans and loan guarantees for
manufacturing facilities and $300 million over three years to
expand the $30 million already allocated to the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency for HDTV research.
   Juan A. Benitez, Commerce Department deputy assistant secretary
for science and electronics, reiterated the Bush administration's
proposal to spur HDTV through lower capital gains taxes, a
permanent R&amp;D tax credit and possible antitrust exemption for joint
industry ventures.

<HEAD>House Passes TV Antitrust Exemption to Encourage Self-Regulation
on Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The television industry may be getting a
chance to adopt voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing violent
programming.
   The House voted 399-18 Tuesday to give television networks,
local stations, producers and the cable TV industry a three-year
antitrust exemption to work up guidelines for depicting non-news
violence on television.
   The vote sent the measure to the Senate, which passed a similar
bill May 31.
   At present, such discussions would violate the Sherman Antitrust
Act, which caused the demise of previous industry self-regulation
under the Television Code of the National Association of
Broadcasters.
   The Senate version of the bill was approved with an amendment by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that also would allow the TV industry to
discuss ways to curb scenes that glorify drug use and portray
sexually explicit material.
   A House-Senate conference committee will have to work out
differences in the two bills, which probably won't take place until
after the August congressional recess expected to begin Friday.
   David Carle, a spokesman for the bill's chief Senate proponent,
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said President Bush had not indicated he
opposed the measure and was expected to sign it when it reaches his
desk.
   ``This is indirect censorship, pure and simple,'' Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., said during debate on the bill Monday night.
   But one of the authors of the measure, Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., said the legislation was necessary in a TV age in which,
``conservatively, children are exposed to 12,000 violent acts a
year'' on television.
   ``I believe the television industry wants to accept a degree of
help'' to allow them to deal with the problem, Glickman said,
adding that ``constitutional experts who testified before the
Judiciary Committee said this bill did not conflict with the First
Amendment.''
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., a cosponsor of the bill, said he
had changed his mind.
   ``Now I have concluded that it is a mistake,'' Berman said.
``The notion that the `wildings' of New York, the crime rate of the
District of Columbia ... are a direct or even a partial result of
violent television is a dubious notion at best.''
   The Senate twice before has passed similar legislation sponsored
by Simon, who has said ``overwhelming'' evidence exists that TV
violence contributes to aggressive and destructive behavior in
viewers.
   Both Senate bills died when the House failed to pass them. House
legislation had been bottled up in the Judiciary Committee under
then-Committee Chairman Peter Rodino, D-N.J. But the TV violence
bill passed out of the House committee this year under a new
chairman, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas.
   Broadcasters, aware that Congress could impose mandatory
restraints, have supported the legislation, but are concerned that
they would be vulnerable to lawsuits from anyone they did not
include in the talks on curbing violence.
   The American Civil Liberties Union has called the legislation a
``Trojan horse'' that could open the door for eventual government
censorship of TV.

   Security agents interrogated the
country's top opposition leader today to determine if he knew in
advance about a lawmaker's illegal visit to North Korea.
   Investigators from the Agency for National Security Planning,
the government's security arm, questioned Kim Dae-jung after taking
him from his party headquarters to a downtown police station.
   Police and government officials declined comment. A court
warrant was issued allowing authorities to hold Kim for 24 hours.
   The warrant said Kim, head of the Party for Peace and Democracy,
would be investigated to determine whether he was involved in a
trip to the communist north by Suh Kyung-won, a former Party for
Peace and Democracy lawmaker.
   Kim has denied involvement in Suh's trip and charged the
government with political harrassment.
   Suh is jailed on charges of violating national security for
visiting North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in August 1988. South
Korea bans unauthorized trips to the communist north, maintaining
that contacts with its rival must be through official channels.
   Also detained today was National Assembly member Moon Dong-hwan,
a senior Party for Peace and Demcracy member and brother of
dissident Presbyterian Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, who visited North Korea
for talks with North Korean leaders.
   The minister also is jailed.
   Hundreds of party members and supporters chanted Kim's name and
anti-government slogans when agents arrived at party headquarters
and presented detention orders to Kim and Moon before taking them
away.
   ``Disband the NSP (national security agency)!'' they shouted.
The opposition leader smiled and waved as he left.
   Party spokesman Lee Sang-soo said ``the national security
agency's scheme to suppress and destroy the party has reached the
extreme'' with Kim's detention.
   Suh turned himself into authorities June 25 and was formally
arrested three days later. Party leaders said they encouraged Suh
to turn himself in after the party belatedly heard about the trip.
   Kim ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in December 1987,
splitting the opposition vote with rival opposition leader Kim
Young-sam. President Roh Tae-woo, a former army general, received
36.6 percent of the vote.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked an
army post in the capital in a battle that forced thousands of
residents to run for cover. At least two people were reported
killed.
   The guerrillas attacked at dusk Tuesday from their camps on the
slopes of the San Salvador Volcano that looms over the city's
northwest.
   The battle lasted about two hours and one soldier and one
civilian were reported killed. Two civilians and a soldier were
wounded.
   The battle kept thousands of residents of the San Ramon
neighborhood huddled behind walls or vehicles. Automatic weapons'
fire was heard from the northern neighborhoods of Zacamil and
Mejicanos, but there was no immediate word on casualties from those
zones.
   It was the fifth time in eight months that the army post in San
Ramon has been attacked. An estimated 200 rebels are camped on the
volcano.
   Sgt. Ventura Lopez, commander of the detachment of 10 soldiers
at the post, said there were about 60 attackers who hurled TNT.
About 100 army reinforcements later joined the battle.
   Rebels of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
fighting for 10 years to overthrow the U.S.-backed government, have
stepped up attacks in the capital over the past 10 months after a
three-year lull.

<HEAD>Bush's Clean-Air Bill Best Hope for Breaking Stalemate: Industry
Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's clean-air bill could cost
businesses and consumers money but it remains the best hope for
breaking a decade-long stalemate, a coalition of the nation's major
industries says.
   ``There is no gift here _ for consumers, workers or
businesses,'' coalition administrator William Fay said Tuesday in
answer to environmental groups that contend the Bush proposal is a
sellout to industry.
   Representatives of the petroleum, chemical and auto industries,
all members of the Clean Air Working group, offered a mixed review
of the Bush plan at a news conference.
   Fay said the legislation would dramatically control acid rain,
tighten auto and truck emission standards, force some cities to
adopt an alternative motor fuels program and cut ozone emissions
and airborne toxic chemicals.
   But some of the measures, Fay said, would go too far in slashing
industry profits, hurting competitiveness and costing consumers
money when pollution control costs are passed on.
   The industry representatives criticized two cornerstones of the
legislation: use of alternative fuels for some motor vehicles sold
in severely polluted cities, and a cap on sulfur-dioxide emissions
that would prevent utilities from expanding when demand for
electricity is rising.
   Sulfur dioxide is the main component of acid rain, which has
destroyed trees and lakes in the northeastern United States and
Canada.
   Despite the criticism, Fay said the Bush plan should be ``the
basic legislative text from which a final bill will be drawn.''
   It ``addresses serious issues such as ozone ... and toxic air
pollution,'' he said. ``And the president has made a serious effort
to consider costs and build flexibility into the bill.''
   The bill, Fay said, is a much better alternative than competing
bills backed by environmental groups. Those bills would give
industry far fewer choices in devising ways to improve air quality.
   Fay and other industry representatives say Bush's original
annual cost estimate of $14 billion to $19 billion would be far too
low and would cause layoffs because of expense to industry.
   He wouldn't predict how many jobs would be lost or give
industry's estimate of the cost.
   The provisions that upset the industry group the most have been
cited again and again by administration officials as cornerstones
of the legislation.
   The alternative fuels plan would require that in areas with
severe ozone pollution, at least nine cities, vehicles with
clean-burning fuel must be sold according to the following
schedule: 500,000 in the 1995 model year; 750,000 in the 1996 model
year; and 1 million in each of the model years from 1997 through
2004.
   ``We're suggesting the mandate should not be there'' because
automakers aren't certain the technology is perfected or that
consumers would accept the cars, Fay said.
   Michael Mason, a lobbyist with the American Petroleum Institute,
said his oil industry trade group believes the proposal to be ``a
big mistake,'' saying ``there should be a level playing field in
which all fuels should be able to compete.''
   Mason said the Environmental Protection Agency has most-often
mentioned methanol as the likely alternative fuel, a product made
from natural gas that likely would come from Saudi Arabia, Iran or
the Soviet Union.
   He contended the EPA appeared to be biased against giving U.S.
petroleum companies the chance to produce a cleaner-burning
gasoline.
   The Bush plan also would reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by 10
million tons by the end of 2000, based on 1980 levels. But the
measure also would ``cap'' emissions at the reduced level, thus
restricting growth of utilities unless they could further reduce
their emissions from existing plants.
   The cap on such emissions, Fay said, ``is unnecessarily
restrictive, limits economic growth, and makes it difficult to
build new factories and power plants.''

<HEAD>Political Scientist Michael Harrington Dies at 61</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Harrington, remembered as the
``conscience of America'' who inspired such leaders as the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and President Kennedy with books about
America's poor, has died of cancer at 61.
   The political theorist and longtime activist died Monday night
at his home in suburban Larchmont. The death was announced Tuesday
by the City University of New York, where he was a professor of
political science at Queens College.
   He wrote 16 books on the problems of massive poverty in the
midst of affluence and on the cultural stress associated with
technological advance.
   In a 1987 interview with The Associated Press, Harrington
recalled how key individuals, including King and Kennedy, seized
upon his book, ``The Other America: Poverty in the United States,''
to rally for the federal war on poverty.
   ``The luck was that the book came out at a time when there was a
president of the United States who read books, John Kennedy, and he
read it,'' Harrington said. ``It led him to decide to make poverty
an issue in the 1964 campaign.
   ``He was killed before he could do it but that set in motion the
process that led Lyndon Johnson to declare war on poverty.''
   Harrington also was active in the civil rights movement, the
anti-war movement and the movements against apartheid in South
Africa and against U.S. intervention in Central America.
   He grew up in St. Louis in a middle-class family that fared well
financially even during the Great Depression.
   He became attracted to socialism while at Yale Law School, which
he attended for a year. But Harrington did not come face-to-face
with poverty until he went to work as a social worker for the St.
Louis Board of Education, a job he got through political pull.
   ``It was a rainy day where I walked into a building and all the
doors and windows were closed. And the building stank so much that
I almost got nauseous, because all of the smells of the backed up
toilets and the dead rats and the cooking smells of a hundred years
were all there,'' he recalled in the interview.
   ``At that moment I said to myself, this is something I better
spend the rest of my life trying to abolish.''
   City University Chancellor Joseph S. Murphy said: ``Michael
Harrington's intellectual energy, dynamism, and social commitment
enriched an entire generation.
   ``He was the conscience of America, a champion of the
downtrodden and afflicted.''
   Harrington was a founder of the Democratic Socialists of
America, serving as national chairman and co-chairman from 1982
until his death.
   He was secretary of the Socialist International committee, a
chairman of the Socialist Party from 1968 to 1972 and of the
Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee from 1973 to 1982. He was
also a member of the Senior Seminar of the U.S. Department of State.
   His latest book, ``Socialism, Past and Future,'' was published
by Arcade Press last month.
   Referring to ``The Other America,'' Victor Navasky, editor of
The Nation, to which Harrington contributed for more than 20 years,
said: ``It was one of the very few times that a book led to a
federal program, the war on poverty ...
   ``Ever since then there's been a new consciousness that we
should do something about poor people.
   ``He managed to use the `S' word and call himself a socialist
and still have access to the mainstream media and political
parties.''
   Harrington taught at the universities of Paris, Illinois,
Michigan and California at Los Angeles as well as at Harvard
University and the National War College.
   Harrington received his bachelor's degree from Holy Cross
College. He received a master's degree from the University of
Chicago in 1949.
   He is survived by his wife, Stephanie Gervis Harrington, and two
sons. Private cremation services were held Tuesday. A memorial is
planned for September at Queens College.

<TEXT>
   Judge Alcee L. Hastings, fighting to remain on
the U.S. District Court bench, says he had nothing to do with a
plot to get a $150,000 bribe in a Florida racketeering case.
   ``No, sir,'' Hastings said Tuesday under questioning by his
attorney about the plot to get the $150,000 bribe.
   The first black federal judge in Florida, Hastings was impeached
by the House a year ago on charges of plotting to elicit a bribe,
lying to the 1983 jury that acquitted him of that charge and
improper disclosure of information from a federal wiretap.
   A 12-member panel is gathering evidence for the full Senate
before it votes on whether to impeach him and deprive him of his
$89,500 annual salary.
   Also Tuesday, the panel voted unanimously to move disbarred
Washington lawyer William Borders a step closer to being held in
contempt and perhaps jailed for refusing to testify.
   Borders, convicted and imprisoned for 33 months in the case,
refused twice last week to testify, asserting his right against
self-incrimination.
   The committee contends that he can't refuse to testify on Fifth
Amendment grounds because he already has been granted immunity. The
next step would put the issue before the full Senate and then a
court.
   Taking the stand in his defense, the 52-year-old Hastings
offered an explanation for one of the key points being used against
him.
   He said he appeared for dinner at 8 p.m. Sept. 16, 1981, in the
dining room of the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami. Earlier, Borders
had promised to produce Hastings in the dining room at that time on
that date.
   The idea was to prove Borders could influence the judge and thus
encourage a payoff from a man he believed to be a defendant trying
to buy his way out of a three-year racketeering sentence.
   Unknown to Borders, he was talking to an FBI undercover agent
wearing a hidden tape recorder.
   Hastings said he went to the hotel that night with a date
because Borders had suggested that he would meet him there.
However, Borders was in Las Vegas.
   Hasting said he wasn't surprised that Borders didn't show up.
   Hastings has always maintained that Borders, a longtime friend
and law school classmate, was a ``rainmaker'' who boasted of
influence he didn't actually have as a means of drumming up clients.
   The judge also offered an explanation for behavior prosecutors
say suggests an effort to elude the FBI on Oct. 9, 1981, the day
Borders was arrested as he drove out of a suburban Virginia motel
with a garment bag stuffed with cash and undercover agent H. Paul
Rico by his side.
   That day, Hastings was staying at the L'Enfant Plaza hotel in
Washington, preparing for a testimonial dinner in honor of Borders,
then a leader in the National Bar Association.
   Told of the Borders' arrest, Hastings quickly left for Florida
and went miles out of his way to Baltimore-Washington International
Airport to catch a plane when Washington's National Airport was
only minutes away.
   ``I went there to get a flight that I thought would get me to
Fort Lauderdale,'' Hastings testified. ``I really expected to see
the FBI at the National Airport, the Baltimore airport or Fort
Lauderdale.''
   Agents found him later that night in Miami at a friend's home.

   The United States is urging Israel to avoid
endangering American hostages in Lebanon as this country uses
diplomacy _ and hints at military retaliation as an option _ to try
to secure their release.
   The Soviet Union, now strengthening its ties with Iran, readily
agreed to the U.S. request for help. Arab governments and
Switzerland also were enlisted Tuesday in the U.S. diplomatic
campaign to get through to pro-Iranian factions that hold the
Americans captive.
   The hostages' status appeared to be newly imperiled after Shiite
extremists claimed Monday to have hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to free a
cleric it accuses of involvement in terrorist actions, including
Higgins' kidnapping last year.
   Israel's offer to swap Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and two other
captives for all foreign hostages, including three Israelis, was
spurned by the militant organization known as Hezbollah.
   Officials said the United States sent a strongly worded message
to nations in the Middle East _ including Iran _ on behalf of the
hostages. ``We expect those who have influence over the hostage
takers to exert that influence,'' said one official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   While no pressure was brought to bear on Israel _ and no demands
made for the release of the cleric _ the Bush administration is
urging Israeli leaders not to take any action that might threaten
the other eight American hostages, diplomatic sources said late
Tuesday.
   In a series of fast-paced meetings with leaders of the Israeli
government in Jerusalem, American Ambassador William Brown asked
that Washington be kept informed of Israel's actions in the future,
said U.S. officials and diplomatic sources who demanded anonymity.
   Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze took
with him on a previously scheduled trip to Tehran a U.S. appeal
that he urge Iran to arrange the release of the American hostages
in Lebanon.
   In Moscow, the Soviets denounced as ``inhuman'' the reported
execution of Higgins, but also said Israel had aggravated the
situation by abducting the sheik and registered concern over ``an
escalation of acts of violence and terror.''
   Still, Bush administration officials hoped Moscow might be
influential with Iran on the hostages. The Soviets were approached
while Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Shevardnadze
attended a conference on Cambodia last weekend in Paris.
   And in Stockholm, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly
said he asked Soviet diplomat Nicolai Kozyrev at a meeting Tuesday
on Afghanistan that Moscow ``use its good offices to influence the
Iranian government to bring about their (the hostages') safe and
immediate release.''
   U.S. military retaliation, as an option, was raised at the White
House. An administration source said Tuesday it was ``in the realm
of the possible.''
   Apart from other considerations, though, the fact that the
hostages' captors shuttle them frequently from house to house in
Lebanon and live among women and children in slums and camps makes
targeting the captors difficult.
   The immediate concern, U.S. and other diplomatic sources said,
was Joseph J. Cicippio, a 58-year-old comptroller of the American
University of Beirut whose execution was threatened for Tuesday,
then put off.
   Intrigued by the reprieve, U.S. officials left open the
possibility it was prompted by Iranian intervention.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
United States had not asked Israel to release Obeid.
   She cited U.S. policy against dealing with or making concessions
to terrorists.
   ``No, we have not because you know our longstanding policy on
hostages, and Israel understands the U.S. policy on the matter of
hostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

   After raising expectations of dramatic U.S.
action to prevent the killing of American hostages in Lebanon, the
White House is shifting gears, trying to dispel notions of an
administration gripped by crisis or scrambling to launch a military
strike.
   To underscore an appearance of near-normalcy, President Bush
pointedly refused to cancel plans Tuesday night for a barbecue
dinner on the South Lawn for members of Congress, complete with
country music.
   While acknowledging ``these are not easy days,'' Bush smiled and
clapped his hands to the tunes of the Oak Ridge Boys and thanked
them for bringing a ``touch of joy, touch of brightness'' to the
White House.
   The president told his guests that ``even though there are
complicated times, I think an evening like this of just plain
relaxation with friends is very, very significant and very
important.''
   It was a different message on Monday when a grim-faced Bush cut
short a cross-country trip and hurried back to Washington,
denouncing the ``brutal murder'' of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins by
kidnappers in Lebanon.
   Taking a page out of Ronald Reagan's playbook, Bush summoned his
top military, national security and foreign policy advisers to a
White House meeting. That was followed by an evening briefing by
Bush for members of Congress.
   In the Reagan White House, that kind of scenario suggested the
United States was about to do something dramatic, such as a bombing
raid on Libya or air strikes against Libyan oil platforms.
   However, in this instance, military action was put on the back
burner while the Bush administration pursued a diplomatic solution.
An administration source said a rescue operation for the hostages
or a military strike were ``not attractive options.''
   With the lives of American hostages at stake, Bush was concerned
military action would risk the lives of U.S. citizens in captivity,
aides said.
   And Bush, the author of a 1986 task force report on terrorism,
knew well the danger posed by military action to innocent civilians.
   ``Our principles of justice will not permit random retaliation
against groups or countries,'' the Bush report said.
   The report also acknowledged that counter-terrorism operations
are high-risk missions that ``can have a severe negative impact on
U.S. prestige if they fail.''
   The administration got a breather in the hostage drama Tuesday
when the kidnappers of American hostage Joseph Cicippio announced a
48-hour extension in his threatened execution.
   Administration officials said it was not certain whether the
original deadline provided to the news media was real or not, or
whether the reported extension means anything.
   In any event, the White House clearly did not want Bush to be
portrayed as a helpless captive of terrorists, dominated by their
every move and forced to respond to their actions.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``has
been conducting other work'' beyond the hostage matter. ``It has
not preoccupied the government on a fulltime basis...
   ``We do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere,'' he said.
``But we do want to portray one of concern and one in which the
government shares the concern of the American people for the
citizens held hostage.''
   For Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., chairman of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff, as
well as Fitzwater, the hostage situation is one they have grappled
with since midway in the Reagan administration.
   ``If you've been through this before,'' Fitzwater said, ``you
know you've got to plan for the long term. You can never be sure of
your information.''
   He said officials experienced in such matters ``emphasize the
importance that everyone acknowledges in taking the time to fully
ascertain the facts, to give a thorough assessment of the
situation, to coordinate and diplomatically contact our allies ...''
   It is basically the same process the administration _ first
Reagan and now Bush _ has been pursuing for years.

<HEAD>Senate and House Have Different Approaches to Random Drug Tests</HEAD>

   Both the Senate and House have bills to impose
random drug testing on transportation workers, but the measures
still have most of the differences that kept them from being
combined into a single law a year ago.
   The Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill Tuesday that would
require random and other testing of workers with safety-related
jobs on planes, trains, trucks and buses, while the House on Monday
passed a measure affecting only railroads.
   Similar bills passed both chambers last session, but lawmakers
failed to come up with a single law.
   Sen. Jack Danforth, R-Mo., a sponsor of the Senate version, said
the committee's bill was the ``best way to prevent the lethal
consequences of transportation substance abuse.''
   The Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over all modes of
transportation, while the House Public Works and Transportation
subcommittee that produced the House bill only covers railroads.
   Unlike the House approach, Danforth said, the Senate bill would
give workers the incentive to seek rehabilitation before they are
caught while the House measure would encourage workers to wait
until they are caught.
   Both bills authorize employers to conduct drug tests before
hiring, on reasonable suspicion and after certain accidents, as
well as at random.
   The Senate legislation would require airline crews, railroad
crews and truck and bus drivers to submit to a variety of drug and
alcohol tests.
   Rehabilitation programs would be set up by employers for workers
who voluntarily seek help, but the Senate bill offers no guarantee
of rehabilitation or continued employment for a worker caught by
the tests or involved in a drug-related accident.
   The House bill would require testing only for railroad workers,
and would mandate employers to set up rehabilitation programs for
workers caught under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job.
   The Transportation Department already has ordered a wide range
of drug tests, including random tests for railroad crews, but they
have been challenged in the courts. The tests don't cover alcohol
abuse.
   If the Senate measure is passed, a conference committee would
have to work out the differences in the two bills before a law
could be sent to President Bush for his signature.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops, Stocks Up Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen for the
third consecutive day today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
index rose marginally.
   The dollar closed at 136.20 yen, down 0.45 yen from Tuesday's
136.65-yen finish. It opened at 135.58 yen and moved between 135.50
yen and 136.30 yen.
   The dollar now has declined 3.25 yen in three days.
   Mitsui Bank dealer Yoshitsugu Hanada said market players in
Tokyo were mainly making position adjustments today in the absence
of market-affecting news.
   ``The market's basic sentiment has been toward a weaker dollar
because of the falling U.S. interest rates, but Japanese investors
were trying to buy whenever the dollar fell,'' he said.
   ``When investors found out that the dollar wouldn't fall further
today, some of them started to buy it back, which helped the
currency end higher than its opening rate,'' Hanada added.
   But because of a slowdown in the U.S. economy, the dollar seemed
unlikely to rise again, he said, adding: ``Friday's (U.S.) jobless
rate report will be another indicator.''
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
in early trading but ended up only 0.88 points, or 0.003 percent,
higher, closing at 34,899.334.
   It surpassed the 35,000 mark for the first time at the end of
morning trading. But Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan
Securities Co., said investors started selling to take profits as
soon as the afternoon session began, and the index fell back.
   ``Market players avoided buying to prevent prices from rising
too fast,'' he added.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 800
million shares, up from Tuesday's 700 million.
   Among gainers were steel, electric power company and chemical
issues.

<HEAD>Bloch Said ``Pierre'' Was Just Stamp-Collecting Friend, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suspected spy Felix S. Bloch says he knew his
presumed KGB contact only as a stamp collector, according to
informed sources who also say the U.S. diplomat hasn't confessed to
taking money from the Soviets.
   The sources, commenting Tuesday only on condition of anonymity,
said suspicions about Bloch first arose when the United States
intercepted a May 14 telephone call to Bloch from a man named
Pierre, believed to be a Soviet agent in Paris.
   The suspected Soviet agent was among several individuals under
surveillance, including one who works for the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO,
according to the sources.
   Bloch and Pierre set up a meeting in Paris, and U.S. authorities
arranged for surveillance by the French intelligence service, said
the sources. The French filmed Bloch and the suspected KGB agent
exchanging briefcases a few days later at a Paris restaurant, the
sources said.
   Another telephone call from Pierre to Bloch came June 22, after
the State Department official had returned to Washington. Pierre
voiced veiled concerns that the two of them might be under
counterintelligence surveillance, the sources said.
   Three sources essentially confirmed details of events first
reported Tuesday by The Washington Post. No charges have been filed
against Bloch.
   The telephone call tipping Bloch that he might be in danger was
said to have come on the same day the State Department called him
in, stripped him of his building pass and diplomatic passport, and
placed him on administrative leave.
   Soon afterward, the FBI held its only interview with Bloch. In
it, he portrayed Pierre as a stamp collector and used that
relationship to explain the Paris meeting, the sources said.
   During that interview, Bloch made no admission that he was
working for the KGB or that he had accepted money from the Soviets,
according to the sources. Other reports have suggested he has told
the FBI he accepted money.
   Meanwhile, the apparent standoff in Bloch's espionage case
continued Tuesday, with Bloch inside his Washington apartment,
which coincidentally is just one block from the Soviet consulate.
The apartment was under constant watch by the FBI and the news
media.
   Intelligence sources said the job of making an espionage case
against him remains difficult because of the lack of a confession.
They said that U.S. officials may at some point be forced to
abandon any plans to prosecute and instead may make a deal with
Bloch to do a damage assessment _ an inventory of information that
has been lost or compromised _ if they remain convinced he actually
was helping the Soviets.

<HEAD>`Mandy Patinkin in Concert' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS four grafs with other reviews; no PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mandy Patinkin never does anything halfway.
   If you need proof, the evidence is on display at Broadway's
Helen Hayes Theater where he has opened in a dazzling one-man show
called ``Mandy Patinkin in Concert: Dress Casual.''
   There's nothing casual about Patinkin except maybe his clothes _
red T-shirt, gray sneakers and baggy, black pants. The intense
performer, best known to theater audiences as Che Guevara in
``Evita'' and Georges Seurat in ``Sunday in the Park with George,''
is one of those unique artists who can make an audience cheer. At
the Helen Hayes, he scorches the stage with a virtuosic performance
that is as exhausting as it is exhilarating.
   What makes his show so special?
   Patinkin doesn't just stand there and sing. He takes over each
song as if it were a story, and he were telling it directly to you.
There's a simplicity in his communication that is disarming,
particularly when he is sweetly singing an old standard like
``Pennies from Heaven'' or Randy Newman's ``Marie.'' But he's not
afraid of a little histrionics either, like his almost
over-the-edge, down-on-one-knee version of Jolson's ``My Mammy'' or
``On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe'' performed at full
throttle.
   Although there is a heavy dose of theater songs, Patinkin's
wide-ranging repertoire is astonishing. His precise diction and
exact phrasing make him a natural singer of Stephen Sondheim songs.
And he doesn't disappoint, coming up with two numbers from ``Into
the Woods,'' as well as a heartfelt rendition of the title song
from ``Anyone Can Whistle'' and a hilarious version of ``Buddy's
Blues'' from ``Follies.''
   His grouping of songs is equally effective. Not many performers
would open with ``Doodle Doo Doo,'' move right into ``When the Red
Red Robin Comes Bob-Bob-Bobbin' Along'' and then finish with
``Tchaikowsky,'' a tongue-twisting recitation of Russian composers
from ``Lady in the Dark'' that Danny Kaye made famous. Somehow it
works.
   The show also includes a medley of seven songs from ``Pal Joey''
that seems like a mini-version of the Rodgers and Hart musical, as
well as an impassioned ``Soliloquy'' from ``Carousel.'' Both shows
sound like ideal vehicles for the singer if he decides to return to
the musical theater. In the ``Carousel'' number, Patinkin bounds
around the stage and even does a few chin ups on a backstage bar
while he sings.
   There are several comic highlights including a wacky version of
the Ella Fitzgerald standard ``A-Tisket A-Tasket'' that sounds like
it came out of the television police show ``Dragnet'' and a rare
Kander and Ebb song, ``Coffee in a Cardboard Cup,'' done with all
the sound effects of a typical greasy spoon restaurant.
   There should be a special mention for piano wizard Paul Ford,
Patinkin's partner during the evening. Ford is not just an
accompanist. He anticipates the singer's needs and provides the
support that Patinkin needs as he does his dangerous high-wire
balancing act.
   One final note. No microphones are used during the show. It's a
relevation and a relief to hear Patinkin's unique voice without the
tinny interference of modern technology. ``Mandy Patinkin in
Concert'' truly is ``live'' theater at its best.
   In other reviews:
   Howard Kissel of the Daily News called Patinkin's show the
``most exciting ... in ages.'' ``The range of what he does and the
imagination and power with which he does it are enough for you to
imagine he could singlehandedly revive the American musical
theater,'' Kissel wrote.
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post called Patinkin the greatest
entertainer on Broadway today and described the concert as
``dazzling fun.'' While he can bring tears to your eyes, Barnes
said, ``most of the time you are just happy to be in the same room
with him.''
   Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the show as
``audacious, often brilliant, but also a touch wacky.'' ``Instead
of a bland, all-American confidence, he radiates a fierce, neurotic
intelligence,'' Holden said.

   Well-dressed passersby didn't hesitate to walk
off with computers, desks and other items as U.S. marshals emptied
the office of a downtown Washington computer company whose owner
recently was shot to death.
   ``This is downtown, the Wall Street of Washington, and people
are grabbing and acting like it's a farmer's market and they don't
have to pay,'' said Wendell Holloway, a lobbyist who stopped to
watch the eviction on Tuesday.
   Some people were on their way to work and others were heading to
a sale at a nearby office supply store when they spotted the
merchandise at curbside. Dressed in dark suits, ties, dresses and
high heels, the treasure hunters tossed about words like
``megabytes'' and ``modems'' as they rummaged.
   Marshals removed all the furniture and supplies from an office
that had been leased by Kermit Ferguson, who was fatally shot on
June 28 by a man who walked into another business he owned. No
arrests have been made in connection with the slaying.
   The company was evicted because it owed over $150,000 in rent,
said Blake Esherick, comptroller for Hunter Leasing.
   District of Columbia police said the scavengers are liable for
prosecution on a misdemeanor or felony theft charge, depending on
whether what they took was worth $250 or more.
   A spokesman for the U.S. marshal's office said the property
belongs to the owners and is not considered abandoned until it has
been on the curb for 72 hours.

<TEXT>WARSAW: increasingly independent.    Prior to Kiszczak's election,
the Communists lost a key parliament vote for the first time in postwar
Poland as Solidarity pushed through a resolution to investigate the outgoing
government for economic misconduct.    The free trade union movement believes
the government of Mieczyslaw Rakowski _ now Communist Party chief _ should
be held accountable for the unraveling of the economy during its nine months
in office.    Poland, convulsed by consumer shortages and triple-digit
inflation, suffered further Tuesday when price controls were lifted on
meat, sugar and other basic commodities.    After a Sejm speech by Communist
floor leader Marian Orzechowski, in which he charged such an investigation
would not be fair, the deputies voted 206-169 with 31 abstentions to create
the commission anyway.    The commission would decide if there were legal
grounds to refer government misconduct to the State Tribunal, which handles
prosecutions of the government.    It was the first substantive vote the
Communists have lost, although they have been on the losing side of some
procedural matters.

   After bracing for the worst, relatives of
hostage Joseph Cicippio said they hoped his two-day reprieve would
lead to his release after three years in captivity.
   ``For the next two days, we want to see what kind of movements
take place,'' said his brother, Thomas Cicippio. ``This is an
opportunity for everyone to pull together, right now. We really
need this.''
   Shiite Moslem extremists who have been holding Cicippio in
Lebanon threatened to kill him at 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday in
retaliation for Israel's abduction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
religious leader.
   More than two hours after the deadline, they announced a 48-hour
extension.
   ``I am mentally and physically worn out and now we must endure
this for another two days. We are being held hostage, just like my
father,'' said one of Cicippio's sons, David, 27, an electronics
technician from nearby North Wales.
   Joseph Cicippio, 58, was acting comptroller at the American
University of Beirut when he was kidnapped from the campus Sept.
12, 1986.
   The threat to kill Cicippio came shortly after another group
said Monday it had hanged hostage Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in
retaliation for Obeid's abduction.
   Tom Cicippio, 66, came out from his suburban Philadelphia house
several times Tuesday to answer questions from reporters. He called
the extension ``good news for all of us.''
   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held
Western hostage, agreed that the extension could improve the
situation.
   ``I think the longer they talk, the longer they delay, the
greater the chances that we may turn this around and get them all
home,'' said Ms. Say in Nashville, Tenn.
   Anderson, 41, was the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press when he was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Former hostage David Jacobsen said the Israeli action that
apparently led to the reported hanging of Higgins may have spoiled
plans for Anderson's release. Jacobsen, speaking from his Colorado
home, said sources in London told him that Anderson was to be freed
last Saturday by the new Iranian government as a gesture of good
will.
   In Michigan, Virginia Rose Steen said she fears commenting on
recent developments while her husband, Alann, remains a hostage. He
was kidnapped in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.
   ``It's not my place to say anything right now,'' she said Monday
afternoon outside her parents' Clark Lake home. ``We worry about
all of the hostages constantly, 24 hours a day.''
   Cicippio, Anderson and Steen are three of the eight Americans
held hostage in Lebanon.
   Before hearing of Cicippio's extension, his brother stuck to his
belief that diplomacy was the only way to free his brother.
   ``I don't want to see any military action to try to rescue the
hostages. That would seal their fate,'' Tom Cicippio said.
   But two of Joseph Cicippio's sons said force shouldn't be ruled
out.
   ``It's time we took some kind of action. Who knows what kind of
threats are going to be made in the next 48 hours? I have President
Bush in my prayers and I pray that he makes the right choice,''
David Cicippio said.
   Asked about the prospects of military action, Joseph Cicippio
Jr., said, ``I think it's probably going to come to that.
Negotiations are best, but that's a last resort. If it comes to
that, at least we can say we tried,'' he said.
   After his 20-year marriage broke up, Joseph Cicippio worked in
Saudi Arabia and London before accepting the post in Beirut in
1984. He remained close to his family in the United States, and the
Cicippios believed he was protected from kidnapping because he
converted to Islam and married a Lebanese woman.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Force Removes Cruise Missiles from Greenham Common</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENHAM COMMON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first cruise missiles have
been removed from Greenham Common but the women who made the base a
synonym for protest say they aren't going anywhere.
   ``Just because the Americans are moving out a measly 16 missiles
everyone expects us to go away,'' Catrina Howse, who had been
involved in the protests for seven years, said Tuesday.
   ``We are here to stay. This is nothing more than a military
manipulation exercise. We've nothing to celebrate until the entire
base is shut and restored as common land.''
   A U.S. Air Force transport plane flew out the first group of the
96 missiles at Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said 16
missiles were removed Tuesday but the Air Force refused to disclose
a number.
   The missiles are to be destroyed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base
in Arizona, the Air Force said.
   All the missiles are to be removed by 1991 under the U.S.-Soviet
intermediate weapons arms control treaty signed in 1987.
   Anti-nuclear campaigners established a peace camp outside the
base in 1981, but the protests gained prominence after the
deployment of the cruise missiles on Nov. 14, 1983.
   At the height of the protests, 35,000 women encircled the base.
   On Tuesday, about a hundred women appeared around the base, and
a few climbed over the barbed-wire atop the base's fences before
being rounded up by military police.
   ``Greenham will remain a focus of non-violence. We are not
impressed with this publicity gimmick. As long as military weapons
are in this country we will be here,'' said Elizabeth Junor.
   ``It is a victory for the women at the camp who have stayed here
year in and year out and kept the issue in the public light,'' said
Ann Harris, who brought a bottle of champagne. ``It isn't the end
but it's a great day.''
   One woman, Stephanie Johnson, had come to the base hoping to say
goodbye to more than the missiles.
   ``I'll be glad to see the back of them and those bloody women,''
she said. ``I support what they are doing but they have made such a
mess of the area they will not be missed.''

<TEXT>
   Robert H. Bork favors amending the
Constitution to prohibit flag desecration and expressed his views
before the committee that led the way in blocking his confirmation
to the Supreme Court.
   Bork returned to the Senate Judiciary Committee as it opened
hearings on measures to ban desecration of the flag. His schedule
did not allow time for committee members to question him. But he
told reporters outside the hearing room, ``I have no particular
emotional response'' to returning to the committee that questioned
him for five days in 1987 before voting against his nomination by
then-President Ronald Reagan.
   The full Senate agreed, voting against him, 58-42.
   Bork agreed there was an irony in his appearance since the man
confirmed for the seat Bork had been up for _ Anthony M. Kennedy _
voted with the majority in the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that flag
burning is protected free speech. Bork has said if he were on the
court he would have voted to uphold a Texas law against flag
desecration.
   The committee is considering proposals to amend the Constitution
or enact legislation to reverse a Supreme Court ruling June 21 that
said burning or desecrating the flag as a form of political protest
is a constitutional right.

   Rescuers today recovered the bodies of three
members of a family whose house was crushed by a landslide,
bringing to eight the death toll from torrential rains in the Tokyo
area, police said.
   Three firefighters died Tuesday while trying to rescue the
family.
   The National Police Agency said three people were still missing
_ one in Saitama, just north of Tokyo, and two in Chiba, to the
south.
   The rains, which began Monday night, flooded 7,111 houses,
caused 298 landslides and damaged roads at 50 places in Tokyo and
four neighboring prefectures, said a national police official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Kawasaki, just southwest of Tokyo, firefighters and police
recovered the bodies of Saburo Kogure, 59; his wife, Nobuko, 57;
and son, Tsutomu, 28, from the wreckage of their two-story wooden
house, which two landslides buried Tuesday, police said.
   The second landslide buried 14 firefighters who were trying to
rescue the family. Three of the rescuers were killed and 11
injured, four seriously.
   In Chiba, a station wagon carrying a family of five fell into a
reservoir after being hit by a landslide, another national police
official said. He said three children were rescued from the
vehicle, but the parents were killed.
   More than 9.8 inches of rain fell in Tokyo, while 17.7 inches
were recorded in parts of Chiba from late Monday through Tuesday,
the Central Meteorological Agency said.

   Iran may be responsible for two recent
political murders outside its borders, according to Western
officials who fear Tehran has set up a unit of assassins to kill
foes on foreign soil, a published report said today.
   Iranian assassins are suspected of the murders of a Kurdish
leader in Vienna and a former Iranian military intelligence officer
in the United Arab Emirates capital of Dubai, The Washington Post
reported.
   Unidentified Iranian exile sources were quoted as saying Iran's
Revolutionary Guards have set up a team of assassins.
   The newspaper quotes unidentified Western diplomats as saying it
was unclear who approved the assassinations, but that the killings
may have resulted from power struggles inside Iran between
moderates and hard-liners seeking to eliminate dissidents abroad.
   The Revolutionary Guards are under the authority of Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the winner of Iran's July 28
presidential election. Rafsanjani has shown greater willingness to
open to the West in recent months.
   Austrian Prime Minister Alois Mock said it was ``probable'' the
June 4 attack in Vienna on Abdolrahman Qassemlou, an anti-Iranian
Kurd, was committed by Iran. Iran has denied responsibility.
   In Dubai, police believe an Iranian assassin murdered Ataellah
Bayahmadi, a former military intelligence officer under Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, while he was on a secret mission to meet
with Iranian military officers sympathetic to anti-government
forces.
   Bayahmadi was working for the Flag of Freedom Organization, a
Paris-based group dedicated to overthrowing Iran's Islamic republic.
   The newspaper quoted Iranian exile sources who said Bayahmadi's
killer has been identified as a man named Kabuli, who was denied
entry to Dubai but who entered the country through the neighboring
shiekdom of Sharjah.

   A generous scattering of showers led to the posting today of
flood watches in parts of northeast Texas, and rain fell elsewhere
throughout the South.
   Showers and thunderstorms pelted parts of Texas as a result of
the remnants of Hurricane Chantal _ which was downgraded to a
tropical depression _ and locally heavy rain was expected to cause
flooding in the state.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered this morning from Virginia
into northern Florida, across Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and from
northeast Texas across the upper Texas Gulf coast.
   Showers were scattered in the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico and
the Rockies, as well as northern Utah, and the northern Pacific
Coast.
   The nation's high temperature Tuesday was 112 degrees at
Bullhead City, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from central and eastern Texas across southern Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama, as well as from southern Florida across
southern South Carolina; scattered showers and thunderstorms in
Montana and central Colorado; rainshowers extending from northeast
New York state across northern New England.
   Predicted highs: 80s and 90s across much of the nation; 70s
across northern New England, from the northern Rockies to the
Pacific Northwest, and along the Pacific Coast; near 100 in western
North Dakota and eastern Montana; near 115 in the desert Southwest.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45 degrees

   Iran's main opposition group claimed
today that President-elect Hashemi Rafsanjani secretly sent his
brother to Syria to ``closely supervise'' the killing of Lt. Col.
William Higgins.
   Rafsanjani has been quoted by the Soviet news agency Tass as
denying in a meeting with visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze that Iran had any ``relation to the tragedy.''
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said in a
statement that Rafsanjani exerts direct control of the radical
Shiite Moslem groups believed to be holding Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   The group said Rafsanjani sent his brother, Mahmoud, ``secretly
to Syria a few days ago in order to closely supervise the terrorist
acts of the regime's proxies in Lebanon, including the execution of
the American hostage, Col. Higgins.''
   The opposition's statement said Mahmoud Rafsanjani heads the
Iranian foreign ministry's ``Lebanon Committee'' set up to
coordinate the kidnappers' activities.
   The statement was sent by telex to The Associated Press from
Baghdad, Iraq, where the group has its headquarters.
   A Shiite Moslem group calling itself the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth claimed it hanged the U.S. Marine on Monday in
retaliation for Israel's abduction Friday of a Shiite Moslem cleric
in south Lebanon.
   The group released a videotape that purported to show Higgins
hanging from a makeshift gallows. There was no indication when it
was filmed. Prior reports indicated that Higgins, who led a
75-member U.N. truce monitoring force in Lebanon, may have been
killed by his captors last year.
   Moslem fundamentalist groups loyal to Iran are believed to be
holding most of the 16 western hostages in Lebanon.
   They are thought to be linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God, an
Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group seeking to dominate the
1.2-million strong Shiite community in Lebanon, the country's
largest sect.
   The Mujahedeen statement alleged that several Hezbollah
officials sent from Tehran to Lebanon were told to ``extend their
stay in Beirut for another two weeks on the orders of
President-elect Rafsanjani in order to carry out the execution of
Col. Higgins.''
   Hezbollah denies it has anything to do with hostage-taking,
while Iran has sought to distance itself from the reported hanging
and threats to execute other western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Rafsanjani, who was voted president by a landslide majority in
Friday's election, is believed anxious to erase Iran's image as a
sponsor of international terrorism.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Monday before Higgins'
death was announced the threat against him ``has nothing to do with
us ... However, we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat.''
   But on Sunday, Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi warned
that Islamic groups around the world would retaliate for the
aduction of the cleric, Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.
   The Mujahedeen statement said Iran used its embassy in Damascus,
Syria, as a headquarters for Hezbollah activities in Lebanon. Syria
is a close ally of Iran.
   The statement said Iranian Revolutionary Guards based in Lebanon
were responsible for ``military training of terrorists, operational
planning, interrogations and other intelligence operations by the
regime's proxy terrorist groups in Lebanon.''
   About 4,000 Revolutionary Guards are currently believed based in
the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon.
   Khomeini's 1979 fundamentalist revolution in Iran helped spawn
several Shiite terrorist groups in Lebanon. Revolutionary Guards,
sent into Lebanon during the 1982 Israeli invasion, helped organize
Hezbollah.

<HEAD>Researchers Use Liquid To Help Premature Baby Breathe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new respiration technique that uses a
liquid to deliver oxygen to a patient's lungs could save premature
babies and affect the abortion debate, researchers said.
   In May, a baby born after 28 weeks of gestation and within an
hour or two of death from lung damage was kept alive 19 hours when
doctors filled the infant's lungs with perfluorocarbon, an
oxygen-carrying liquid, said Dr. Thomas Shaffer, a Temple
University physiologist and pediatrician who led the team.
   He and his colleagues are on call to attempt the procedure again
when a candidate becomes available, Shaffer said.
   The baby girl, born two months premature and weighing just under
2 pounds, was the first human to undergo the procedure, according
to Dr. Michael Harrison, a pediatric surgeon at the University of
California San Francisico. Harrison was not involved in the
research in Philadelphia.
   If the procedure could be shown to shorten the time a fetus is
dependent on its mother, the technology could affect the abortion
debate in the country, said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center
for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
   In its controversial decision July 3, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled states may require doctors to determine through various tests
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving
outside the womb. Many states prohibit aborting a viable fetus, but
the court's 1973 decision making abortion legal drew the viability
line at 24 weeks.
   Generally, premature babies delivered 23 to 24 weeks from
conception stand a chance of surviving without major disabilities,
researchers said.
   If the liquid ventilation technique is successful, it could push
that time period back to 20 weeks, Shaffer said.
   However, it is still unclear whether organs other than the lungs
would be developed enough to sustain life at 20 weeks, he said.
   Aside from premature babies, the procedure holds promise for any
kind of situation where a patient's lungs cannot be ventilated with
gas, Shaffer said.
   Dr. Leland C. Clark, a chemist at Children's Hospital Medical
Center in Cincinnati who first discovered the technique, said
perfluorocarbon acts as a liquid Teflon to gently separate parts of
the lung that stick together after a collapse in a premature baby.
   In adults, the body produces surfactant, which prevents the
inside of a lung from sticking to itself. But in premature babies
who have not yet developed surfactant or in babies who lack the
material, normal ventilation runs the risk of bursting a lung or
damaging it, he said.
   The infant, whose lungs had been damaged by two weeks of
conventional ventilation and had partially collapsed, was close to
death May 10 when the experiment was performed, Shaffer said.
   About a half ounce of perfluorocarbon, a liquid that carries
oxygen, was poured into the baby's lungs through her trachea, he
said. About another quarter ounce of the liquid was allowed to flow
in and out of her lungs, bringing fresh oxygen, for 15 minutes,
Shaffer said.

<HEAD>Nissan to Ban Chloroflourocarbons from Its Vehicles by 1993</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Co. said today that it plans to make
its car air conditioners and manufacturing processes free of
chlorofluorocarbons, the gases blamed for destroying the Earth's
protective ozone layer, by 1993.
   Nissan became the first of Japan's major automakers _ which are
heavy users of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) _ to announce a total ban
on the gases.
   Nissan spokesman Shingo Suzuki said the company, helped by
air-conditioning makers such as Hitachi Ltd. and Calsonic Corp., is
developing new car air conditioners that use a new substance to
replace CFC-12.
   Nissan has used some 1,150 tons of CFC-12 a year as coolants, he
said, and a total of 1,500 tons of CFC's a year for all purposes,
accounting for 1.2 percent of total CFC use in Japan.
   In the United States, the spokesman said, Nissan already has
stopped using CFC-11 in the making of automobile bumpers and will
do so in Japan by the end of next year.
   By the end of 1993, he said, the company plans to replace
CFC-113 with water for cleansing automobile parts. He said this
will require the company to develop additional processes to dry
parts after washing. CFC-113 dries instantly.
   ``But it depends on the feasibility of CFC alternatives,''
Suzuki said. ``If we can get stable supplies of new substitutes,
our goal is certainly attainable.''
   Toyota Motor Co. spokesman Hiroshi Hashimoto said, ``Although
we've been considering environmental issues, we haven't reached the
stage to announce anything concrete.'' He said Nissan's move would
``prompt Toyota to consider the issue more seriously and swiftly.''
   An official of the freon countermeasure division in the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry called such moves by the
private sector ``very welcome.''
   Companies that have to use additional machines and substances in
the process of cutting CFC use can obtain tax reductions, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Montreal, Canada, 38 countries agreed in 1987 to reduce
production and use of the gases. Under the Montreal Protocol,
participating countries must freeze their CFC consumption this year
at the 1986 level and reduce consumption to 5 percent of the 1986
level by the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Legislation Proposed to Shield Public Figures From Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawmaker is proposing a bill that would
allow drivers to prevent anyone from finding their home addresses
through state motor vehicle records, the way a man apparently
tracked slain actress Rebecca Schaeffer.
   ``We intend to prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening
again,'' Assembly Speaker Pro-tem Mike Roos said Tuesday.
   Robert John Bardo, 19, has been charged with shooting Miss
Schaeffer to death on July 18 outside her apartment complex. He
allegedly hired an Arizona detective agency to locate Miss
Schaeffer. She was traced through Department of Motor Vehicles
records.
   Currently, the motor vehicle department will provide the address
of any license holder to anyone who fills out a request form and
pays a small fee. The form does ask the reason for the request.
   Under a proposal Roos plans to introduce later this month, a
person applying for a driver's license or to register a vehicle
would be allowed to request their home address be kept
confidential, he said. Applicants would have to provide a post
office box or alternative address, or the address of an attorney or
agent that could be given to anyone who files an address request,
he said.
   The bill ``will provide a balance between the public's right to
know and the right to privacy,'' Roos said at a news conference
outside a DMV office in Hollywood.
   About 16 million requests were filed in California last year,
Roos said.
   Anyone can obtain the home address ``of their favorite anchor
person, favorite movie star, favorite Los Angeles Dodger or
favorite politician, if they have one,'' he said.
   City Attorney James Hahn said numerous crime victims and trial
witnesses have been harassed by people who located them through
motor vehicle records.
   ``Right now we're all sitting ducks,'' Hahn said. ``Home is the
last refuge of your privacy, and if someone is intent on doing
malicious harm they're going to see it through.''
   The proposal follows last week's signing by Gov. George
Deukmejian of a law inspired by alleged threats against actress
Theresa Saldana.
   Sen. Dan McCorquodale said the law he sponsored was designed to
keep violent, mentally ill prisoners in mental hospitals after they
complete their sentences. To do so, a district attorney must prove
an inmate will be a danger to someone following release.
   Miss Saldana was stabbed several years ago by drifter Arthur
Jackson. Jackson allegedly wrote letters from prison threatening to
harm the actress when he was paroled.
   A parole board postponed Jackson's scheduled June 15 parole for
nine months, saying he had fought with the prison staff and broken
a window.

<HEAD>New Front-Runner in Japan's Prime Ministerial Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former education minister who served a
reform-minded government in the 1970s today emerged as front-runner
in the race to become Japan's next prime minister, governing party
members said.
   Toshiki Kaifu became the leading choice to replace Sousuke Uno,
who has been in power only two months, after 78-year-old Toshio
Komoto said he would not run for president of the deeply troubled
Liberal Democratic Party.
   That cleared the way for Kaifu, Komoto's protege, whose
candidacy drew support from other factions in the conservative
governing party.
   ``I'm overwhelmed by the honor and will do my best,'' Kaifu said
at a news conference after Komoto's faction, with 30 members one of
the smallest in the party, united behind him.
   Kaifu, who earlier had said he supported Komoto for party
leader, was the only declared candidate for the post. The Liberal
Democrats' president is certain to be elected prime minister
because of the long-governing party's commanding majority in the
lower house of parliament.
   Kaifu said it was too early to speak in detail about his
policies, ``but political reform is the biggest issue that has been
raised by the people.''
   He said he had received about $110,000 in political funds over
five years from the Recruit Co. conglomerate at the center of the
influence-buying scandal that originally rocked the political
establishment in Japan.
   But Kaifu said all the donations had been reported, and that he
had stopped receiving money from the company after the scandal
emerged last year.
   The Liberal Democrats are to choose a new leader on Tuesday.
   Uno is resigning to take responsibility for the setback in the
July 23 election in which the Liberal Democrats lost their majority
in parliament's upper house for the first time in the party's 34
years, with opposition Socialists gaining strongly.
   Komoto, whose faction ranks a lowly fifth in size among the
party's power blocs, told reporters he had decided not to be a
candidate after canvassing opinion in the party, where many members
say they want a younger president to help repair the party's image.
   ``I've decided that having Kaifu run is the most appropriate and
the best,'' the party elder said.
   Kaifu, a 10-term member of the lower house, was a follower of
the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, who led the government from
1974 to 1976 following Kakuei Tanaka's scandal-plagued
administration.
   Miki was known as the ``Mr. Clean'' of Japanese politics for
efforts he made to throttle back corruption, and Kaifu served as
deputy chief Cabinet secretary under Miki.
   Later, Kaifu served twice as education minister, totaling about
two years.
   He is a member of the party reform committee that was set up in
the wake of the Recruit scandal.
   The Liberal Democrats, in power for more than three decades,
have lost popularity amid a series of scandals that accentuated the
party's image as arrogant and complacent. The party also railroaded
through Parliament a new 3 percent sales tax that is extremely
unpopular.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita stepped down June 2 because of
the party's low popularity and was succeeded by Uno, whose
scandal-free image quickly crumbled amid allegations he had kept
paid mistresses.

clergyman Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, which it called ``in essence, a
terrorist act.''
   The Pravda commentary by analyst Yuri Glukhov said Friday's
kidnapping of Obeid by Israeli commandos was ``a criminal action
(that) provoked the tragic course of events.''
   A Shiite group said it hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins on Monday because Israel refused to release the cleric.
   Kidnappers have threatened to kill another American hostage,
Joseph Cicippio, on Thursday if Obeid is not freed.
   Pravda focused on Israel's ``terrorist actions'' over the past
years, including abductions and political assassinations, and said
the Israeli occupation of the West Bank made the entire Palestinian
people ``the hostage of an aggressive policy.''
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry also blamed Israel for sparking the
hostage crisis. In a hastily called briefing Tuesday, spokesman
Vadim Perfiliev denounced the killing of Higgins as ``inhuman'' but
accused Israel of ``aggravation of the situation.''

<HEAD>Military Personnel Overseas Will be Counted in 1990 Census</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 3rd and 4th grafs to CORRECT that states fear loss of representation
and to clarify use of census figures in distributing House seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is
resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed
overseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep counting
illegal aliens.
   The House blocked an effort Tuesday to require aliens to be
excluded from the census numbers used in House reapportionment
every decade. But the question still may be raised in committee and
in the Senate.
   The national head count will be taken April 1, 1990. Census
figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the
states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local
governments.
   The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of House
members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses
of House seats. Most of these states are in the North, where growth
has lagged behind that of the South and West.
   Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West
and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss
of power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
   While aliens have been counted in the past, military personnel
stationed overseas have not.
   The Commerce Department settled that problem by announcing it
will work with the Defense Department on ways to count the 1.2
million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers who
live overseas.
   The problem has been in deciding which states may count these
people as residents. That has yet to be decided, but possibilities
include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last
state where he or she lived for at least six months.
   The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both in
committee and on the House floor.
   Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on
counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 million
to run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year,
including $800 million to take the census. The bill was approved
258-165 and sent to the Senate.
   Opponents noted the Constitution requires House seats to be
apportioned based on all the ``persons'' residing in a state.
   ``Every census since the Constitution was created has counted
all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''
observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   ``Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in the
census, responded Ridge. The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget for
the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal
aliens, he said.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really over
population shifts that will lead to more House seats for southern
and western states.
   ``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go down
to the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose a
seat,'' said Dymally.
   Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., said, however, that counting illegal
aliens ``is not fair. It may be constitutional, but it's just not
right.''
   Census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete
illegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in the
country legally. Asking people about their status likely would
result in people lying or refusing to participate in the count,
officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of residents in
many areas.

   The only race that concerns George W. Bush is the
American League pennant chase.
   Bush _ oilman, baseball team owner and president's eldest son _
declared Tuesday he would not run for governor of Texas next year.
   ``I have had time to think and sort things out, and at this
time, I am not a candidate for governor in 1990,'' Bush said in a
speech to lawyers.
   ``For now I want to focus my obligations to the Texas Rangers
baseball team and more importantly on my responsibilities as a
father and as a provider,'' he said.
   Bush is managing partner of the Rangers, who are battling for
the American League West division title.
   Bush said he knows better than to ``never say never,'' but he
felt very little could change his mind about not running in 1990.
   ``I think that's a very honest and forthright statement,'' said
Fred Meyer, state GOP chairman. ``I do believe at some point he's
going to be a factor on the political scene because I think he
handles himself very well.''
   Since returning to Texas last year after helping his father's
presidential campaign, the 43-year-old Bush has been widely viewed
as a likely candidate for governor.
   Republican Gov. Bill Clements has said he will not seek
re-election.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin today defended
Israel's kidnapping of a Lebanese Shiite clergyman, saying the
Cabinet considered the dangers to foreign hostages in Lebanon
before approving the abduction.
   Speaking to parliament, Rabin also disclosed that the Cabinet
had approved Friday's capture of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid two months
ago.
   He said final approval was delayed until ``every grain of
possibility for dialogue'' had been exhausted on winning the
release of three Israeli soldiers believed held in Lebanon.
   Rabin said Israel did not inform any other country of its
intentions to abduct Obeid. ``We didn't include any other country
before the action and did not even offer information about it,'' he
said.
   The 12-member inner Cabinet of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
also met today to discuss the hostage crisis, but there was no word
on the outcome of that meeting.
   In his address to parliament, Rabin said Israel has rejected an
International Red Cross appeal to visit Obeid, who was abducted
along with two associates from the south Lebanon village of Jibchit.
   He said Israel would agree only if the Red Cross was able to
visit Israeli captives.
   During his 22-minute address, Rabin read anew Israel's offer to
swap Lebanese Shiite prisoners held by Israel and for 16 Western
hostages and the three Israelis.
   Israel is believed to be holding up to 60 Shiites in Israel, and
allied militias in south Lebanon are believed to hold an additional
300.
   Rabin defended the Obeid kidnap against criticism that Israel
did not consider the dangers to foreign hostages.
   ``We took into consideration all the possible reactions,'' he
said. ``We saw them all, including the actions that already took
place, and ones even worse.''
   A Shiite group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed
on Earth claimed it killed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins on
Monday after Israel refused to free Obeid. A second group said
another American hostage, Joseph Cicippio, would be killed on
Thursday unless the cleric is freed.
   Israel maintains Higgins was killed several months ago.
   Rabin said the Cabinet approved the abduction of Obeid, a
spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement that is
believed an umbrella group for hostage-takers in Lebanon, after
extensive efforts to gain freedom for its captured soldiers. He did
not detail those efforts.
   ``So the government of Israel decided to allow the army to
apprehend the leader of the Hezbollah in south Lebanon so we would
have in our hands valuable property for a prisoner swap,'' he said.
   He described the abduction of Obeid, whom he accused of
involvement in Higgins kidnap and the abduction of two Israeli
soldiers, as ``very successful.''
   ``On this stage, I want to send my blessings to the chief of
staff and the commanders of the army and the unit that carried it
out on the way this mission was carried out,'' he said.
   Rabin spoke in response to three motions of no confidence
introduced by three small Arab-oriented parties. The motions in the
120-seat body were defeated by a 31-5 vote with one abstention and
most of members absent.
   Mainstream opposition groups refused to join in the attack on
the government, saying lives were at stake and criticism should be
postponed.
   The defense minister was interrupted at one point by an Arab
member of Parliament, Mohammed Miari, who chided Rabin for
announcing his hostage swap offer 30 minutes after the deadline set
for Higgins' purported hanging.
   Communist and Arab legislators accused the government of
kidnapping Obeid to divert attention from efforts to resolve the
Palestinian problem and end the uprising against Israeli occupation.

   Six children were killed when fire swept
through their family's trailer home early today in a rural area of
northern Louisiana, firefighters said.
   Neighbors said the dead children ranged in age from 2 to 16.
   Their parents, Ronald and Mary Jane Ellerbe, were listed in fair
condition at E.A. Conway Memorial Hospital in Monroe, where they
were treated for smoke inhalation.
   Two other children _ Mary, 14, and Glen, 9 _ also survived and
were not injured, neighbors said.
   Neighbor Patsy Naron said she was awakened by Mrs. Ellerbe
banging on her door and screaming ``Fire.''
   ``We ran out and the farthest end of the trailer was on fire,''
said Ms. Naron's daughter, Denise, 17. ``You could hear the kids
screaming. The whole trailer was up in flames and the trees were on
fire.''
   She said she and others were ``trying to tell the kids to go to
the back (of the trailer). The front was all just on fire.''
   A Ouachita Parish Fire Department spokesman said Ms. Naron
reported the fire at 12:18 a.m. Firefighters had the fire under
control within five minutes of arriving, he said.

   Here is a state-by-state look at wildfires burning in the West:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IDAHO: Hundreds of lightning-caused fires have burned 80,000
acres, much of that on national forest land. Flames were near three
small mountain towns, and more than 5,000 firefighters were on the
fire lines.
   MONTANA: A fire burning in grassland and scattered timber in the
Custer National Forest became the state's biggest blaze of the
summer Tuesday when it surpassed 1,200 acres. About 140
firefighters were dispatched to fight the blaze in the southeast
corner of the state. Several smaller blazes burned elsewhere.
   OREGON: Fires east of the Cascades have burned 80,000 acres and
were being fought Tuesday by 5,000 people. The worst of the blazes
were around Baker, where ranchers forced from their remote homes
over the weekend were allowed back by Tuesday.
   WASHINGTON: Crews contained an 850-acre forest fire in the
Pasayten Wilderness near the Canadian border Tuesday, freeing 80
firefighters to join battles in Idaho and Oregon. About 1,200 Army
troops at Fort Lewis were to head to wildfires in Oregon after
completing a one-day crash course in firefighting.
   CALIFORNIA: More than 1,300 firefighters fought in steep canyons
in the Cleveland National Forest southeast of Los Angeles to
encircle half of a fire that blackened 8,200 acres of brush and
burned a home, a mobile home and a travel trailer. In the Sierra
Nevada foothills, firefighters contained an 11,700-acre wildfire
that destroyed seven homes.

   Helicopters are rescuing people from rooftops in
the Soviet Far East, where the worst flooding in more than 35 years
has killed 15 people, destroyed thousands of houses and washed out
crops, Tass reported today.
   The official news agency said sections of the main railroad in
the region, the Vladivostok-Khabarovsky Railway, were destroyed
Tuesday night.
   Bridges and tracks were ruined as the Ussuri and Malinovka
rivers overflowed near the city of Dalnerechensk, Tass said.
   The report said 1,000 passengers were stranded at the
Vladivostok Railroad Station and that three passenger trains were
turned into mobile homes for people waiting until the tracks are
restored.
   In a report Tuesday, Tass said rivers in the Dalnerechensk and
Lesozavodsk districts had risen more than 20 feet and caused a
``critical situation.''
   Crops _ including potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers _ were
destroyed on more than 100 farms, and more than 70,000 head of
cattle were cut off from pastures or stalls, the news agency said
Tuesday. Thousands of houses were destroyed and hundreds of miles
of roads and telephone and power lines were ruined.
   The Maritime Emergency Commission told Tass that preliminary
estimates put the number of dead in the floods at 15. The area is
near the Sea of Japan, 4,500 miles east of Moscow, and 250 miles
northeast of Beijing.
   Rain inundated the area for five days, but it has now stopped
and the water level of rivers is declining slowly, Tass said.
   Military helicopters were taking people perched on rooftops and
trees to safety and bringing food, medicine and clothing to
inundated villages.
   Tass said the flooding was the worst in the area since 1953,
when virtually the entire north of the maritime territory of the
Soviet Union was under water.

<HEAD>New Polish Prime Minister Oversaw Talks with Solidarity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The country's new prime minister, Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak, played a leading role in suppressing Solidarity
in 1981, but he also helped initiate this year's campaign that made
the union legal again.
   Once a shadowy figure best known for his crackdowns on
dissidents, Kiszczak emerged earlier this year as a valuable
negotiating partner for the opposition in the two months of talks
that resulted in Solidarity's legalization and in partially free
elections.
   Despite Kiszczak's new outlook, Solidarity opposed him for prime
minister. Members of the Communist-allied Peasant Party also talked
of defecting, but he gained victory by a slim margin today in
parliament.
   The 63-year-old army general, who has been interior minister
since 1981 and thus supervised the nation's police forces, donned a
civilian suit for this year's talks with Solidarity. He often drove
his red Peugeot to a palace in downtown Warsaw where negotiations
were held.
   With a mixture of charm and toughness, Kiszczak quickly
impressed union negotiators. He disarmed underground writers by
praising their essays.
   It was Kiszczak who made the proposal for talks with the
opposition on political and economic reform a year ago during a
wave of nationwide strikes, Poland's worst labor unrest since the
early days of Solidarity seven years ago.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa refused to commit Solidarity to
talks without a pledge that the union would be legalized. In a
dramatic reversal, President Wojciech Jaruzelski, then the
Community Party leader, pushed through an offer to restore the
union's legal status at a party plenum in January.
   Three weeks later, as chief negotiator for the government side,
Kiszczak opened the negotiations. Agreements reached April 5 led to
legalization of Solidarity and partially free elections in which
Solidarity scored dazzling victories July 4 and July 18.
   But Kiszczak was one of 33 out of 35 top government and party
officials who ran unopposed on a national slate and failed to get
the required 50 percent of votes cast.
   Kiszczak's relations with the opposition were not always so
cordial.
   Along with Jaruzelski and Defense Minister Florian Siwicki,
Kiszczak helped impose the December 1981 martial-law crackdown in
which thousands of Solidarity activists were rounded up and
imprisoned.
   Three years later, Interior Ministry security police on his
payroll murdered the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a pro-Solidarity
priest who kept the ethos of the union alive in monthly Masses for
the homeland at his Warsaw parish.
   Kiszczak saw that the four officers were convicted of murder,
but the trial stopped short of revealing any higher-level
involvement, which some opposition members still suspect.
   As head of the ministry responsible for containing the
opposition which flourished underground after martial law, Kiszczak
developed a deep knowledge of Solidarity.
   One leading Solidarity activist who has spent years in jail
recently joked that one of the best collections of underground
literature can be found in the ministry's basement.
   Born in 1925, Kiszczak's war experiences contributed to the
evolution of a tough, young officer. Shipped by the Nazis to work
as a forced laborer in the southwestern city of Wroclaw, Kiszczak
escaped and made his way to communist resistance forces in Austria.
   He joined the Communist Party in 1945 and helped in the campaign
against Polish partisans opposed to the imposition of Communist
rule.
   Kiszczak later attended the Voroshilov Academy of the Soviet
armed forces in Moscow and was promoted to general in 1973. He
served as head of military intelligence between 1972 and 1979 and
head of the military police in the Ministry of National Defense
between 1979 and 1981.
   Jaruzelski named Kiszczak head of the Interior Ministry in
August 1981, several months before the crackdown on Solidarity.

<TEXT>
   Here is a text of the acceptance speech by
Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak after his election as prime
minister. The speech was monitored on Polish television and
translated by The Associated Press:
   I would like to thank you for entrusting me with the honorable
mission of forming the government of the Polish People's Republic.
   The confidence which I enjoyed in the support for my candidacy I
treat as ... an obligation. I will do whatever is in my might not
to fail this confidence.
   With attention, I approach those deputies who voted against my
candidacy. Their opinion inclines me toward an active search for
ways and means of gaining a broader parliamentary and social
understanding and approval for the activities of the government
which I intend to form.
   I face, and naturally the high chamber (the Sejm) faces, the
question of the shape of the new Cabinet, its program and
philosophy of functioning.
   I state with regret that so far, the concept of creating a
``grand coalition'' government has not been accepted.
   I think that a government of such a construction would be most
appropriate today for overseeing the course of issues of the
country. That is why in forming the Cabinet on as broad a basis as
possible, I will not give up efforts to attract to it
representatives of opposition circles with a hope that in the
future a grand coalition government will be possible.
   I opt for a government of the ``roundtable.''
   I do not refer here only to the symbol of agreement and national
reconciliation, but most of all to its substantial content and ways
of shaping the process of dialogue. A vision of Poland's
development has been outlined in the roundtable accords (reached
between Solidarity and Communist authorities in April),
corresponding with social aspirations and expectations.
   The new government should work with all its effort toward
realizing this vision, especially as far as the shape of the new
economic order and political reforms are concerned.
   As co-chairman of the roundtable, I feel morally and politically
obliged to guarantee the concluded agreement of Poles. I will thus
do everything so that the directions of the government's work might
correspond with the supreme reasons of state and the nation.
   The seriousness of the internal situation, especially in the
economic sphere, imposes the necessity of quick action. I would
thus like to ask the high chamber if I could present the program of
action and makeup of the Council of Ministers within the next two
weeks.
   Thank you.

   An analysis of the remains of five gold
prospectors who died in 1874 supports cannibal Alferd Packer's
claim that he killed only one, experts say.
   Packer, who had led the gold expedition in the Rockies, said one
man killed the four others with repeated hatchet blows while Packer
was away from camp. Packer said he killed that man in self-defense
and survived the winter on the flesh of the dead.
   ``Four of the five were repeatedly hacked,'' James Starrs,
professor of law and forensics at George Washington University,
said Tuesday, summing up the laboratory findings. ``If ever there
was demonstrative evidence of overkill, this is it.''
   The analysis at the Human Identification Laboratory at the
University of Arizona also concluded that knife marks on the bones
appear ``consistent with a conscious effort to deflesh the deceased
bodies,'' Starrs said.
   Packer was convicted of manslaughter in all five deaths and
served a prison term.
   Starrs recently led a team that dug up the remains from a common
grave about two miles from Lake City.

   Here are excerpts of a speech by Bronislaw
Geremek, leader of the Solidarity opposition in the Sejm,
explaining why its members opposed the election of Czeslaw Kiszczak
as prime minister. The text was monitored on Polish television and
translated by The Associated Press:
   The (Solidarity) Citizens' Parliamentary Club will vote against
Czeslaw Kiszczak's candidacy for the post of chairman of the
Council of Ministers.
   We stand against this candidacy not because he is the chief of
the Interior Ministry, of which this part of the chamber so often
used to be the clientele.
   We also know in recent months that Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak can be
a negotiator and can carry on dialogue with people on the other
side of ideological and political barriers. We also appreciate the
words uttered in his statement, referring to the continuation of
the philosophy of the ``round table'' and the anticipation of
changes.
   We stand against this candidacy because no personnel reshuffle
within the present political arrangements, dictated by the monopoly
of a single party, can solve the country's problems.
   We are of the opinion that one cannot change things by
continuing the present situation of the country, that a break is
necessary, a break that will clearly say that we (Solidarity
lawmakers) have arrived in this building on Wiejska Street. And I
would like to be able to say that all of us have come in order to
change things. ...
   I think that as we sit here, a will for change can be found on
all sides of this chamber. However, in our opinion, changes in the
way of exercising power must be made so that this change could
correspond with the Polish situation.
   A political monopoly of exercising power by one party must be
discarded and destroyed. It does not serve the country.
   And this is why we think that, with the necessary amount of
confidence, the Polish opposition is capable of building a program
of change and of carrying out this program.
   Lech Walesa's statement said clearly that the Polish opposition,
all its circles, expects deep, structural changes and that the
Polish opposition is ready to form a government appropriate to the
tasks the country faces.
   It is ready to take responsibility not only for leading the
country out of crisis but also for changing the way of exercising
power. Because without this change the situation of the country
cannot improve.
   In a responsible way and with a feeling of realism we are able
to form a government of national salvation. ...
   Such a government of change could be a chance for the country.

   Pope John Paul II has agreed to intervene to
seek the return to the United States of the body of Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins, the Vatican said today.
   The pope acted after a call Tuesday from President Bush, the
Vatican said in a statement.
   ``His holiness expressed the willingness of the Holy See to find
a solution to this problem,'' it said.
   Shiite extremists claimed Monday to have hanged Higgins in
retaliation for Israel's refusal to free a Shiite Moslem cleric
kidnapped by Israeli commandos July 28. Israel accused the
clergyman, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, of involvement in terrorist
activities, including Higgins' abduction Feb. 17, 1988.
   John Paul, in the conversation with Bush, expressed hope that
``the leaders and the parties involved find the roads to
constructive accords in the higher interests of peace and full
development of the people of the Middle East and the world,'' the
statement said.
   Vatican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
diplomatic contacts for the release of Higgins' body were already
under way using channels that the Vatican has kept open for months
during the latest round of fighting in Lebanon.
   John Paul has repeatedly appealed to all factions in the region
to halt the fighting and to help rebuild the country.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the pope and Bush
spoke for 12 minutes.
   The Vatican previously helped in the return of the body of a
U.S. pilot killed in a U.S. raid on Libya in 1986. The remains of
Maj. Fernando Ribas-Dominicci were turned over to the Vatican's
representative in Tripoli and flown to Italy in January.

   In a major policy reversal, Prime Minister Hun Sen
of Cambodia said today he has told his Vietnamese-backed government
to welcome a U.N. peace mission to be sent under terms of an
international accord.
   The United States and 18 other nations meeting in Paris agreed
earlier this week to send the investigation team to help prepare
for a permanent peace settlement in war-ravaged Cambodia.
   ``I have already given instructions to give all the assistance
necessary to this technical mission,'' Hun Sen said in a meeting
with reporters at his hotel near the Champs-Elysees.
   At the start of the monthlong international conference on
Cambodia on Sunday, Hun Sen had opposed the United Nations playing
any role in monitoring a peace plan.
   The world body recognizes a coalition of three Cambodian
guerrilla factions as the nation's legitimate representative _ not
Hun Sen's government.
   The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1978, ousting communist Khmer
Rouge rulers and installing the current regime. Renewed civil war
quickly broke out, and the Khmer Rouge are now the strongest
guerrilla force.
   Hun Sen said he changed his mind about the U.N. mission after
receiving assurances from the foreign ministers of Canada and
Australia and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that
the visit of the U.N. mission would not imply future U.N.
involvement in peace efforts.
   The U.N. team will present its report to a conference committee
charged with creating a mechanism for monitoring the pullout of
Vietnamese troops.
   Hun Sen has said the Vietnamese forces in his country have
already been reduced to 26,000. Vietnam has said it will pull out
the last of those troops, once estimated at more than 50,000, by
Sept. 27.
   It was still unclear, however, when the U.N. team would leave
for Cambodia and whether the Khmer Rouge would make the
unprecedented gesture of allowing the mission to visit the refugee
camps it controls.
   The Khmer Rouge killed an estimated 1 million people with its
harsh programs after it drove out a U.S.-backed government and took
power in 1975.
   The group's role in a future government has been a sticking
point at the conference.
   Hun Sen says the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge should be destroyed.
China says the Khmer Rouge should take part in a transitional
government.

<TEXT>
   Even Gov. Michael Dukakis' hometown
seems to be turning against him as the state grapples with budget
troubles.
   Brookline _ steadfast backers of the Democrat from his days as a
state representative in 1962 through his failed presidential
campaign _ sued the governor today over a plan to cut state aid to
cities and towns.
   The city is accusing Dukakis of using one formula to hand out
state aid and another formula to cut it.
   The change means Brookline faces a cut of $1.9 million in state
aid for schools, police and fire protection instead of the expected
$1.1 million reduction.
   ``To get to the point of where we're actually suing the state or
the governor over his actions is a very painful, emotional step for
me to come to,'' said Selectman Chairman Jeffrey Allen, a longtime
Dukakis backer.
   ``But I think he was wrong and I don't think his actions in
changing the local aid formula are legally defensible.''
   The state's budget troubles _ which many blame on Dukakis _ led
to a $210 million reduction in aid to cities and towns last month.
   John Hanson, an aide to the governor, defended the use of a
different formula to favor poorer communities when cutting grants.
But he added that the governor has yet to decide on whether the
formula will even be used.
   Local aid is distributed by a complicated ``needs basis''
formula; the second formula would make cuts on a per capita basis
instead.

<HEAD>Kiszczak Elected Prime Minister in Communist Party Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Kiszczak's acceptance speech. No

<TEXT>
   Parliament today elected the interior
minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, as prime minister in a victory for
the long-ruling Communist Party, whose power has been eroding.
   In his acceptance speech, Kiszczak pledged to try to bring
members of the Solidarity-led opposition into his new Cabinet. He
asked Solidarity to reverse its position that it will not accept
joint responsibility for governing Poland.
   Although it has rejected joining a coalition government,
Solidarity has not ruled out allowing members to serve in the
Cabinet.
   Kiszczak, the nation's top law enforcement officer, was elected
by Parliament's lower house, the Sejm, by a vote of 237 to 173 with
10 abstentions. The required majority was 211 votes.
   As interior minister, Kiszczak implemented the 1981 martial law
crackdown that suppressed the free trade union movement, but he
also helped initiate this year's campaign that made Solidarity
legal again.
   The vote for prime minister had been postponed Tuesday when some
deputies in the communist-allied Peasant Party sought a government
dominated by lawmakers of the Solidarity independent trade union.
   But after urgent arm-twisting Tuesday night by their party
leadership and Communist officials, most Peasant Party members
ended up voting for Kiszczak, the handpicked candidate of Communist
President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   ``Looks like they were frightened,'' said Solidarity member Jan
Litynski following the vote.
   Solidarity's floor leader in the Sejm, Bronislaw Geremek, said
in a speech before the vote that his group opposed Kiszczak's
candidacy ``because no personnel reshuffle within the present
political arrangements, dictated by the monopoly of a single party,
can solve the country's problems.''
   In reaching out to the opposition in his acceptance speech,
Kiszczak said that ``in forming the Cabinet on as broad a basis as
possible, I will not give up efforts to attract to it
representatives of opposition circles with a hope that in the
future a grand coalition government will be possible.''
   ``I opt for a government of the roundtable,'' he said in a
reference to the government-opposition talks that led to
Solidarity's legalization this year.
   In his speech carried on Polish television, the new prime
minister also promised ``quick action'' to deal with the country's
economic problems.
   After his election, Kiszczak asked for two weeks to assemble a
Cabinet, which also must be approved by the Sejm. He said he wanted
Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula, who handled economic policy
under the outgoing government, to perform the same function in his
Cabinet.
   Jan Bielecki, a Solidarity deputy from Gdansk, said Kiszczak's
government could be one that ``promotes a free market but retains a
strong police.''
   The election completes a two-week reshuffle of the top Polish
leadership.
   Jaruzelski, for eight years the communist first secretary,
assumed Poland's new strong presidency with control of the military
and foreign relations July 19. Outgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw
F. Rakowski succeeded him at the helm of the party Saturday. And
now Kiszczak, a Jaruzelski loyalist with his own base in the army
and defense ministries, has become head of government.
   Before Kiszczak was elected, the Communists lost a key
parliamentary vote for the first time in postwar Poland as
Solidarity pushed through a resolution to investigate the outgoing
government for economic misconduct.
   Solidarity believes the outgoing government of Rakowski should
be held accountable for the unraveling of the economy during its
nine months.
   Poland, convulsed by consumer shortages and triple-digit
inflation, suffered further Tuesday when price controls were lifted
on meat, sugar and other basic commodities. Prices rose 43 percent
for most goods.
   The Communist coalition holds a 299-161 majority in the Sejm,
but the Communists have just 173 seats and they had not been sure
they could count on deputies of the allied Peasant and Democratic
parties, which used to obediently follow the Communists.
   According to several deputies, the Peasant caucus leader,
Aleksander Bentkowski, had proposed that they and Solidarity
jointly form a government with a Solidarity prime minister.
   ``We have a general as president. Now they want a general as
premier. And we know they want a Communist to be deputy premier,''
said one Peasant Party member on condition of anonymity. ``What
kind of new government is that supposed to be?''
   Opposition lawmakers entered Parliament after June elections,
the country's freest in four decades, ended the Communists'
monopoly of legislative power.
   The Solidarity victory was so overwhelming _ the movement won
all but one of the seats it was allowed to contest _ that it asked
to be allowed to form the new government, but Jaruzelski rejected
the prospect as unacceptable to East bloc allies.
   Jaruzelski has promised to allow an eventual transition to
complete democracy.
   Kiszczak represented the government in talks with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa that led to Solidarity's legalization in April
after a seven-year ban.
   Like many leading Communists, Kiszczak failed to be elected a
deputy in the June elections though he ran without opposition. He
needed 50 percent of the vote to win a seat.

   A strong earthquake crumbled homes and
triggered landslides in the remote province of Irian Jaya, killing
at least 90 people and injuring more than 125, officials said today.
   Rescue efforts were hampered by the landslides and by cracks in
the airstrip nearest the stricken area. The quake struck Tuesday
and measured 6 on the Richter scale.
   In the villages of Holuon, Soba and Pasema, 90 bodies were found
under demolished homes and tons of mud, a spokesman from the
governor's office in Irian Jaya told The Associated Press by
telephone.
   About 3,000 people live in the villages.
   The spokesman, Supardi, said more than 25 people had been
treated for serious injuries and 100 for slight injuries, and about
300 had been evacuated to safer areas. He said more helicopters
were needed to help evacuate victims.
   The quake destroyed a number of villages along the side of Mount
Kurima in the district of Kurima, 2,190 miles east of Jakarta.
   The villages were near the epicenter of the quake, which struck
at 9:17 a.m. Tuesday.
   Supardi said mud and earth piled 650 feet high were blocking the
Baliem River, which flows around Kurima district, making it
difficult to reach victims and raising fears the river would burst
through and flood nearby villages.
   Bob Breuker, a senior official from the Mission Aviation
Fellowship, said the missionary organization had two helicopters
and a Cessna helping rescue efforts but that he could not get any
details from the rescue teams because of bad communications.
   Irian Jaya is one of the most primitive areas in the world.
Natives of some of the 240 tribal groups still hunt with bows and
arrows.
   The quake Tuesday was the worst in the province since 1981, when
a quake killed more than 300 people.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 6 can cause severe damage.

   A businessman was the informant who led
FBI agents in 1964 to the graves of three slain civil rights
workers in Philadelphia, Miss., according to files of the state's
old segregation agency.
   The files naming Olen Burrage were obtained by The
Clarion-Ledger. Its account Tuesday represented the first time the
tipster who purportedly led agents to the bodies in an earthen dam
has been publicly identified.
   Burrage on Monday denied any connection with the killings of
James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner and denied being
an FBI informant.
   ``I didn't have nothing to do with it,'' Burrage told the
Clarion-Ledger. ``I'm not going to have anything to do with it now.
   The state never charged anyone with the murders, which have
become the focus of renewed attention since being dramatized in the
movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' Several men were convicted of civil
rights violations in the case.
   The 1964 report to Mississippi's now-defunct Sovereignty
Commission said Burrage, on whose land the bodies were found, was
paid $30,000 by the FBI to reveal the location of the graves. The
report was prepared by commission investigator A.L. Hopkins, who
has since died, and quotes an anonymous informant.
   Joe Sullivan, who was the FBI agent in charge of the
investigation, refused to identify the informant who FBI files said
led agents to the bodies. He added in an interview from his New
York City home, ``I didn't pay any money to anybody.''
   Sullivan said a free-lance writer working on the case during the
44 days federal and state officials looked for the three civil
rights workers had offered a reward of $25,000 for information
leading to the bodies.
   The commission, created in 1956 to preserve segregation, became
inactive in 1973 and was disbanded in 1977.
   The Legislature ordered its files sealed for 50 years. U.S.
District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. on Thursday ordered the files
opened to the public, but Barbour stayed his own order pending an
appeal.
   The newspaper said it obtained the report from the personal
papers of the late Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr.
   Documents that have leaked from the files over the years show
the agency routinely kept files on civil rights activists and
individuals friendly with them.

   The remnants of Hurricane Chantal carried heavy
rains and tornadoes into central Texas today, while divers renewed
the search for 10 crewmen missing since their oil rig capsized in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   At least three deaths were blamed on the storm. A man died after
falling from a Chevron oil platform off of Louisiana and two Bryan
teen-agers drowned when they were sucked into a flood-swollen
drainage ditch.
   Also today, Tropical Storm Dean developed into the second
hurricane of the Atlantic season, bearing 78 mph winds it surged
westward toward the Caribbean. The hurricane was 500 miles east of
San Juan, Puerto Rico, moving at 20 mph.
   Chantal roared ashore Tuesday morning at High Island on the
eastern Texas coast, bringing driving rain and wind up to 80 mph.
The first hurricane of the Atlantic season caused flooding and
scattered power outages but little serious damage.
   It lost strength within a few hours and was downgraded to a
tropical storm and then a tropical depression by Tuesday night.
Winds dropped to about 30 mph.
   By early today, the storm's remains were spread over about 90
miles from College Station to Waco, triggering rain and tornadoes.
No damage was immediately reported in central Texas. Forecasters
said the Dallas-Fort Worth area could get as much as 5 inches of
rain in gusty thunderstorms today.
   Divers today resumed their searched for the oil workers 20 miles
off Morgan City, La. Their self-propelled rig, which can be floated
when its 100-foot legs are retracted, capsized Monday while trying
to outrun Chantal.
   Rough seas hampered the divers, who were equipped with
high-powered lights to search the darkened rig. There were
conflicting reports about where the men were last seen _ in the
water or in the watertight crew quarters now submerged in about 30
feet of water, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Glenn LaMont.
   ``They're not sure where they're likely to be, exactly. It's
going to take awhile. The divers are going to move real slow and
real cautiously,'' he said.
   In Bryan, about 90 miles northwest of Houston, police said two
teen-agers drowned while they and two friends were riding rubber
rafts on a rain-swollen stream. The boys were swept into a drainage
pipe under a highway bypass.
   Skies were sunny today in the Houston area, where on Tuesday
hundreds of stalled cars and trucks lined flooded roads and some
motorists sat atop their vehicles as they waited for the water to
recede.
   Nena Neal, whose family lost nearly all of their possessions in
a 1979 flood in Dickinson, south of Houston, tied ribbons around
the bases of trees to watch the progress of the rising water in her
yard.
   ``We just got through celebrating 10 years since that flood. We
had water up to here in that one,'' Mrs. Neal said, using her hand
to mark a spot more than 3 feet high. ``We made it through that and
the Lord gave us so much more. And we have flood insurance this
time _ that's the main thing.''
   The coastal city of Galveston escaped much of Chantal's wrath,
but the 6.56 inches of rain in a 24-hour period there broke a
110-year-old record.
   Most of the homes in the area directly hit by Chantal were built
on stilts, limiting much of the damage to roof tiles, exterior
walls and electric lines. ``It wasn't too bad, but it sure shook
that trailer,'' said Bill Estis, who lives in a 27-foot travel
trailer in Gilchrist, east of Galveston. ``I was going to move it
out this morning, but it came in too early so I just decided to
wait it out.''
   Estis then did what few others along the Texas coast would have
considered in winds topping 50 mph on the leading edge of a
hurricane.
   He went fishing.
   ``Oh, I just figured I'd come down here and give it a try. I
caught one while the eye was passing over, but I haven't had a bite
since then,'' he said.

<UNK>Virginia Man Extradited but Cannot Face Death Penalty</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd has agreed to
extradite a man wanted in Virginia on murder charges after U.S.
authorities agreed not to try the man for any offense carrying the
death penalty.
   A Home Office statement Tuesday said Jens Soering, 22, a German
national whose father is the West German consul in Detroit, would
face charges of non-capital murder. No date for the extradition was
announced.
   Soering is accused of killing the wealthy parents of his
girlfriend, Elizabeth Haysom. Soering and Miss Haysom were indicted
on murder charges after they had fled to London.
   Miss Haysom, now 24, did not resist extradition from Britain and
was sentenced in October 1987 to 90 years in prison after admitting
being an accessory to the murders.
   Soering resisted extradition and took his case to the European
Court, a branch of the 23-nation Council of Europe to which Britain
belongs.
   The court found last month that extradition would contravene the
Human Rights Convention if there was a risk Soering might be
sentenced to death.
   The court said the convention would not be breached if the
possibility of a death sentence was removed.
   The Home Office said U.S. authorities agreed to drop the
possibility of a death sentence to facilitate extradition.
   The prosecution claims Soering killed his girlfriend's parents,
Derek Haysom, 72, and Nancy, 55, at their home in Lynchburg, Va.,
in March 1985. The two were found stabbed and hacked to death in
their mansion.

   Syrian and Christian forces skirmished on
the Moslem New Year today with mortars and automatic rifles,
wounding six people, police said.
   ``There is no celebration mood. Beirut has been largely
demolished and hundreds of innocent people have been killed. Do you
expect anyone to celebrate anything?'' said Sheik Rashid, a Sunni
Moslem clergyman at the Dar al-Fatwa center.
   Four of the casualties were in Christian east Beirut and two
were in the city's western Moslem sector, most of them from sniper
fire, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   By police count, the 5-month-old confrontation between Gen.
Michel Aoun's predominantly Christian soldiers and Syrian forces in
Lebanon has claimed 511 lives and wounded 2,168 people.
   Syrian troops moved into Lebanon in 1976 under a peacekeeping
mandate from the 22-nation Arab League to contain the civil war
which broke out in April 1975.
   The Syrians eventually were drawn into the strife, supporting
the Moslem side against the Christians.
   Ferocious artillery duels betwen Aoun's gunners and the Syrian
army inflicted severe damage on most of Beirut forcing 1.3 million
of its original 1.5 million population to desert the city and seek
refuge in safer areas.
   Dar al-Fatwa, the highest Sunni Moslem religious authority,
called off its traditional New Year reception today because of the
current round of violence.
   Government offices, banks, and other businesses closed in
Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors to mark the Moslem New Year,
1410.
   The current confrontation broke out March 8, two days after Aoun
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of
Beirut for depriving the ailing state treasury of about $100
million annually in lost customs dues.
   The Syrians and their Moslem militia allied forces retaliated by
shelling and besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
northeast of Beirut.
   A three-member Arab League foreign ministers' mediation
committee said Tuesday it has reached an ``impasse'' for which it
blamed Syria.

<HEAD>Austrian Conductor Was Under Investigation For Alleged Nazi Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department was investigating
allegations that famed Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan had
been involved in Nazi persecutions, but the probe was dropped when
he died last month, a government lawyer said today.
   The investigation was started several months ago after the
department was informed ``of certain allegations'' about the
conductor, said Neal M. Sher, who heads the Justice Department's
Office of Special Investigations.
   ``We were looking at what his role in Nazi persecution might
have been,'' said Sher, whose office has investigated thousands of
such cases over the years. ``I don't know where the investigation
would have led, but there might have been a question of the
watchlist,'' Sher said, referring to a list of people banned from
the United States for their Nazi pasts.
   Von Karajan, who died of heart failure at the age of 81, was a
member of the Nazi Party and was banned from performing for two
years after World War II ended in 1945. Violent demonstrations were
held during his first U.S. tour in 1954 with the Berlin
Philharmonic, which he conducted for 34 years.
   Von Karajan was born in Austria but moved to Germany in 1934.
His career flourished under the patronage of Hermann Goering, the
field marshal who established the feared Gestapo and was one of
Adolf Hitler's closest aides.
   ``There were allegations that he also worked for the SD,'' the
Nazi security police, Sher said.
   ``There were many questions about him that deserved answers,''
he said. Sher declined to reveal any further information about the
allegations.
   The last prominent person placed on the watchlist was Austrian
President Kurt Waldheim, who was found to have been involved in
atrocities committed by Nazi troops in the Balkans during World War
II.

   The crew of the nuclear submarine
Tennessee, thwarted last week by anti-nuclear protestors, launched
a Trident 2 missile today in the first successful underwater test
of the Navy's newest, deadliest weapon.
   The Tennessee was cruising about 50 miles off Cape Canaveral
when the 44-foot Trident 2 burst to the surface, ignited and
propelled a dummy warhead package far down the Atlantic tracking
range.
   The Navy announced several minutes after the 11 a.m. firing that
the test flight was a success. A Navy statement provided no details.
   The results were in sharp contrast to the Trident 2's first
submarine launch on March 21 when the missile pinwheeled out of
control and exploded four seconds after it was launched from the
Tennessee.
   Investigators traced the problem to a mechanical linkage
responsible for moving the rocket nozzles back and forth. The
system was redesigned.
   The test had been scheduled last Friday but was halted when two
large Greenpeace U.S.A. ships sailed into the launch danger zone in
international waters. Two small motorized rafts dispatched from one
of the ships buzzed the submarine and crew members attached three
``nuclear free seas'' banners to it.
   The Greenpeace vessels did not return today. Protest officials
said last week they had made their point by stopping the launch and
calling attention to their cause.
   The launch today was one of about eight underwater tests planned
over the next few months. If all goes as planned, the Navy will
dispatch the Tennessee on patrol in March with 24 of the
nuclear-tipped missiles.
   Each of the $23.7 million missiles is designed to hurl up to 10
nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away.
   The Navy had hoped to have the Trident 2 operational late this
year, but that was delayed by the March explosion.

   ``The Killing Fields,'' the movie that
showed the brutality of Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s in Cambodia,
will be shown in a Cambodian theater Friday for the first time, the
director said.
   Among those attending the screening will be Sydney Schanberg,
the American journalist depicted in the 1984 Academy Award-winning
film, who will make his first visit to Cambodia since he left there
14 years ago.
   Director Roland Joffe said today it is time to show the film
there because diplomatic events have created optimism that peace
will return to the country.
   ``It is important that Cambodians see this film so that they can
actually feel that there is a chronicle of their own history,'' the
British director told a news conference in Bangkok.
   The showing of the film in the National Theater in Pnomh Penh,
the Cambodian capital, is being organized by Operation California,
a U.S.-based relief agency.
   One of its co-founders, Richard Walden, said the premier of the
Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia, Hun Sen, gave the
go-ahead in March.
   The film depicts how Schanberg, then a reporter for The New York
Times, and his Cambodian assistant, Dith Pran, were separated as
the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh in April 1975 and began its
fanatical revolution.
   Hundreds of thousands died in torture chambers and slave labor
camps, but Dith Pran made it out in a trek to the Thai border
through fields littered with human bones.
   Vietnamese troops invaded in 1978 and installed a new
government, which is fighting a three-party resistance that
includes the Khmer Rouge.
   Schanberg, who now writes for Newsday, said there was a growing
fear the Khmer Rouge could return to power as Vietnam carries out a
pullout it has promised will be completed by late September.
   That, he said, ``is a pretty horrible and awesome thought.''
   Peace talks in Paris this month are aimed at setting up an
interim government.
   Walden said the film has been available in videocassette in
Phnom Penh but this would be the first screening in a theater and
with official sanction.
   A Cambodian film on the Khmer Rouge rule, ``Shadow of
Darkness,'' also will be shown in the theater on Friday.

   A leading intellectual, suspected of acting as
a key link between deposed Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang of
China and that nation's crushed student movement, has escaped to
the West, an activist said today.
   The intellectual, Chen Yizi, fled from China to France several
weeks ago on an ``underground railroad,'' the Hong Kong activist
said. Chen, who is about 50, was director of the Institute of
Restucturing the Economy, an influential think tank when Zhao was
in power.
   While in Paris, Chen participated in meetings to form an
overseas organization to push for democracy in China. However, he
did not meet the press nor was his identity revealed to reporters.
   Indeed, some Western reports said he had been arrested in
Beijing.
   The Hong Kong activist, who demanded anonymity, said Chen
remained in the West but declined to reveal his current
whereabouts. There was no way to immediately confirm the report,
but the activist has been reliable in the past.
   So far, the activist said, about 30 people have fled China via
the ``underground railroad'' set up to help pro-democracy leaders
escape a government crackdown. They include essayist Yan Jiaqi and
student leader Wu'er Kaixi, who were in Paris with Chen but have
since gone to the United States.
   A Western diplomat in Hong Kong has said Communist authorities
apparently wanted to establish direct ties between Chen and Zhao to
prove the purged party leader secretly backed the student movement.
   Chinese authorities began their crackdown on the spring protests
by sending troops into Beijing on June 3-4 to sweep away
demonstrators.
   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua has said nearly 100
soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while
about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese
witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may
have been as high as 3,000.
   It is unclear to what extent Zhao may have been secretly
supporting the pro-democracy movement. So far, the official charges
against him have been vague.
   Zhao, officially purged after the June 4 crackdown, has been
accused of supporting the movement and ``counterrevolutionary
turmoil.'' However, his specific wrongdoings have not been spelled
out.
   More recently, the state-run media have accused him of
responsibility for high prices and widespread corruption.
   Thousands of students and other supporters of the pro-democracy
movement have been arrested in past months.

   A woman eating popcorn out of a bowl she had

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Aug. 1
   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on Israel's kidnap of
Sheik Obeid:
   An unnecessary gamble by Israeli security forces has apparently
backfired into a grisly execution. A violent seizure ended in
violent death, if a news report is true, and Israel cannot justify
a means that provokes a tragic end, regardless of the intent.
   The casualty of this risky kidnapping was not just a failed
negotiation, but a human being, Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a
man assigned to the United Nations' peacekeeping force in the
region.
   Israelis didn't take Higgins prisoner in February of 1988, nor
did Israelis cruelly string him up and strangle him. Yet Israel has
to bear some of the responsibility for what happened.
   The tactic of kidnapping Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, an influential
Shiite Moslem cleric, was apparently done in hopes of exchanging
three captured Israeli soldiers and other foreign hostages. Obeid
is considered by Israeli officials as a spiritual leader of the
Shiite Moslem Hezbollah militia, an umbrella group for factions
believed to be holding 17 hostages, nine of them Americans. Obeid
is also tied to the Higgins kidnapping. ...
   The risks were tremendous. If the mission had succeeded and the
hostages and soldiers were handed over in return for Obeid,
criticism of Israel would be muted, but it still ought to occur.
The tactic itself is open for judgment.
   Much of the world supports Israel's struggle for survival. But
Israel ought to examine this aspect of its struggle.

   Money for bombers, money for ag research, money for ...
   Based on several decisions reached the past few days, we can't
help but wonder whether the U.S. Senate plans to print its own
money.
   The Senate overwhelmingly agreed to back President Bush's costly
stealth bomber request. The House, on the other hand, decided to
delay production of the B-2 bomber for one year. The majority of
House members considered the $70 million B-2 bomber program too
costly in light of the $150 billion budget deficit.
   We agree with the House.
   Spending more for defense and more for ag research might be OK
if lawmakers were dealing with a balanced budget. But they are not.
   This nation's checkbook is overdrawn. It's been overdrawn for
some time. And it will remain overdrawn if the Senate continues to
spend as though our coffers were flush.

   The Durham (N.C.) Sun on the crash of Flight 232:
   Capt. Al Haynes, the pilot of the United Airlines jet that
crashed July 19 in Sioux City, Iowa, says there is no hero in the
horrifying accident. The 185 people who survived the crash of the
DC-10 may disagree.
   In his first news conference since the crash, Haynes said he
heard a loud noise and began shutting down (the plane's tail
engine) ... A short time later, he said, the crew realized the
plane had lost all its hydraulic fluid.
   When he asked another crew member what the flying procedure for
those circumstances would be, he learned there was none. So the
crew had to develop one as it tried to guide the stricken aircraft
to the Sioux City airport.
   The plane crashed landed just short of the runway, flipped and
broke apart.
   Haynes reminded reporters and others of the 111 people who died
in the crash and the importance of determining the cause and trying
to avoid such disasters in the future. He modestly said the four
crew members just ``did their job.''
   He should also remember that in doing so, they saved 185 lives.

   The Portsmouth (N.H.) Herald on President Bush's space proposal:
   The president's efforts to restore a sense of mission to
America's space program are certainly long overdue. But is he
serious?
   In calling for the establishment of a space station followed by
manned expeditions to the moon and then to Mars, George Bush
offered not a clue as to how he proposed to pay for any of it.
   Experts differ as to the scientific value of each of those
objectives. But there's no doubt that accomplishing any of them is
going to require a commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars.
As one congressman pointed out, there's no such thing as a free
launch.
   If the president's vague declarations of intent the other day
manage to set off the kind of national debate on our objectives in
space that American leaders have been avoiding for the past 20
years, that will be one small step in the right direction.

   Officials urged people to stay out of Idaho's fire-ravaged
backcountry and evacuated vacationers near the scorched town of
Lowman, while one fire jumped a river and temporarily closed a
major highway.
   Cooler weather helped firefighters in Oregon and Southern
California and crews contained Washington's only major blaze. But
officials feared lightning could trigger a new round of fires like
the ones that have been burning since the middle of last week.
   Waves of thunderheads caused an estimated 2,000 lightning
strikes an hour early Tuesday in Idaho's Boise National Forest
alone. The thunderstorms let up later and there was no immediate
word of any new fires.
   About 1,200 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., were to begin
heading to lines in southeastern Oregon today after getting a
one-day crash course in cutting containment lines, fort spokesman
George Polich said.
   In addition, four 20-man crews and three helicopters were to
head to Oregon and Idaho today after an 850-acre fire in northern
Washington was contained.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center said about 20,000 firefighters
were on lines in the West, primarily in Idaho, Oregon and
California. Blazes have blackened more than 175,000 acres in those
states and Washington.
   Some of the firefighters came from as far away as Florida. Idaho
Gov. Cecil Andrus said the influx was obvious at Chicago's O'Hare
Aiport, where he waited Monday to return from the National
Governors' Conference.
   ``I saw nothing but green pants, yellow shirts and the boots of
firefighters headed West,'' he said.
   More than 5,000 firefighters battled uncontained fires on more
than 80,000 acres of Idaho range and timber. Andrus predicted the
fight could rage for a month.
   Payette National Forest officials evacuated 16 of the 36
residents of Warren, a small mining town 120 miles north of Boise,
as flames from the 1,000-acre Whangdoodle Fire moved to within a
mile of town.
   ``We're telling them we feel like they're in some danger and
offering to help them evacuate,'' Payette spokesman George
Bukenhofer said.
   Crews carved a break line south of the town with bulldozers and
used pumps to wet the area ahead of the fire, which was shooting
embers two miles ahead of the flames.
   About 100 miles to the southeast, fires that burned on 26,000
acres and destroyed more than $10 million in structures at Lowman
last weekend turned back toward the town Tuesday evening. More than
1,100 firefighters armed with 60 water engines, tankers and two
bulldozers worked to protect the town.
   Boise National Forest officials evacuated about two dozen people
from cabins just west of the town to a campground three miles away.
They also evacuated two lodges outside the town, although Sourdough
Lodge owner Bob Ahern said he would resist the efforts of sheriff's
deputies to get him out.
   ``They keep coming to the door to get me, and I keep telling
them I lost my keys,'' he said. ``They can ask me to leave, but
they can't force me.''
   About 40 miles north of Boise, a rejuvenated 5,000-acre fire
jumped the South Fork of the Payette River near Banks, and
billowing smoke closed Idaho Highway 55 temporarily, Bukenhofer
said.
   Helicopters crisscrossed the Hell's Canyon area near the
Idaho-Oregon line, carrying rangers who brought maps to direct
about 40 hikers to the safest routes out of the backcountry.
   In eastern Oregon, where 80,000 acres have burned, cooler, moist
weather today helped crews cut lines around a 10,300-acre fire near
the town of John Day and fight blazes around Baker and Enterprise.
   Firefighters hoped they could turn back several big timber and
range blazes, said Forest Service spokeswoman Wendy Evans. Several
smaller blazes were contained, and the spread of the bigger fires
had stopped, she said.
   In California, more than 1,300 firefighters aided by six air
tankers and four helicopters struggled in steep canyons 90 miles
southeast of Los Angeles to encircle half of a fire that has
blackened 8,200 acres of century-old brush in the Cleveland
National Forest.
   Sporadic winds hampered the battle, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Rosalinda Ewen. ``It was going in a variety of
different directions,'' she said.
   The fire, which has burned a home, a mobile home and a travel
trailer and forced the evacuation of 100 campers, was started
Saturday by a recreational shooter's ricocheting bullet. Three
firefighters were treated for minor injuries.
   To the north in the Sierra Nevada foothills, firefighters
contained a blaze that burned 11,700 acres of brush and grassland
and destroyed seven homes.

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on the Bloch spy case.
   We don't have to make a judgment as to (spy suspect Felix S.)
Bloch's guilt or innocence to recognize that this Keystone Kops
surveillance raises civil rights questions: how can he defend
himself against non-existent charges?
   But even granting that Bloch may require close watching, is this
the way to accomplish the task?
   It has been suggested that the FBI was so embarrassed at the way
Edward Howard escaped the country while under the agency's
around-the-clock surveillance, that this time it felt it needed the
media's help.
   Strange stuff, any way you look at it. Even if John le Carre
wrote it, we probably wouldn't believe it.
   Felix Bloch may well be a spy, as the government believes. But
before making an international cause celebre, it would be wise to
collect the evidence first, and make the announcement later.

   Delta Democrat-Times, Greenville, Miss., on the crash of Flight
232:
   Investigators continue to look into the crash of United Flight
232 in Sioux City, Iowa, but we've already learned about the
heroism displayed by many of the people involved. In these times of
contagious cynicism, such actions remind us that humans have a
greater calling.
   The heroism begins with the crew of Flight 232. Only great
courage, skill and decisive action prevented a total disaster, and
saved at least 180 lives ...
   After the flaming crash, passengers selflessly helped one
another out of the rubble. One father rushed to find his baby. He
moved several times toward the infant's cries, only to be driven
back by the smoke. He and the mother later discovered that another
survivor had rescued the baby. ...
   Ministers, priests and rabbis immediately attended the
passengers, blessing and comforting the dying, giving hope to
survivors and rescue workers.
   United Airlines notified relatives, and flew them in to be with
survivors. Local restaurants provided free food to survivors and
rescue workers.
   Flying remains the safest way to travel, but such accidents
remain a risk. Amid the tragedy, they also can give us a glimpse of
what the human spirit can accomplish at its best.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on Congress and art:
   Members of Congress have found another small item on which to
spend an inordinate amount of time and rhetoric. They have been
waxing apoplectic about $30,000 in federal arts funding for an
exhibit of photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe. ...
   Their outrage is understandable. One of the photos was of a man
urinating into another man's mouth.
   A $15,000 grant to photograher Andres Serrano, now notorious for
his shot of a crucifix in urine, is also getting panned.
   All that these politicians needed to say was that some artistic
expressions are so revolting to most Americans that tax dollars are
not going to subsidize them. ...
   But Congress wouldn't leave it at that. The Senate voted last
week to place a five-year ban on federal grants ... while the House
wants to cut overall funding for the arts by $45,000. This amounts
to sophomoric retaliation.
   The (National Endowment for the Arts) has received a strong
message from Congress ... and no doubt will be more careful in what
it approves (for financial support) in the future.
   As House and Senate negotiators talk over the differences, they
should know that the sensible part of Congress' message has already
been sent and that what's left in both bills is a rabid
overreaction.

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on cutting the capital gains tax:
   Last year, Democrats blasted candidate ... (George) Bush's
ill-advised call for cutting the tax on capital gains, which have
been treated as ordinary income since the passage of federal tax
reform in 1986.
   Supply-side economics argues that ... cutting the capital gains
tax should spur the kind of investment that contributes to the
overall growth of the economy, such as forming pools of venture
capital and modernizing factories.
   However, a lot of capital gains are realized on activities that
contribute nothing more to the economy's productive capacity: sales
of art and antiques; stock and real-estate speculation; and tax
shelters.
   Worst of all, from the standpoint of tax fairness, the primary
capital gains earners already tend to be the wealthiest of the
taxpayers _ the top 5 percent, by most estimates.
   Democratic opposition to the tax cut, however, is now flagging.
... A Democratic ``Gang of Six'' on (the House Ways and Means
Commitee) recently defected. Added to the 13 Republicans supporting
the Bush proposal, those committee members who want to cut the
capital gains tax now comprise a working majority. ...
   The crowning irony here is that the current capital gains deal
now under consideration by the committee, sponsored by a Democrat,
would favor the wealthy even more than the original proposal first
advanced by George Bush.

   The Greenville (S.C.) News on the crash of Flight 232:
   Alfred C. Haynes, the United Airlines captain, is a reminder
that ordinarily able people are capable of extraordinary competency
and courage. This was an indomitable man at the press conference at
Sioux City, Iowa, a man you'd guess hasn't yet counted his cuts and
bruises, and used a wheelchair only to humor his doctor.
   The mid-air crisis that crippled Captain Haynes' jumbo jetliner
held him and his crew in tortured suspension for nearly an hour.
The challenge to stay aloft, to reach an airport, to attempt a safe
landing, was beyond the imagining of most of us.
   He did it with mental toughness, methodically, calmly, with
knowing trust in his own ability and intuition.
   And he made it all work until seconds before touch down, when
lack of precise control, or perhaps a runway crosswind, dropped one
wing into the ground. The aircraft cartwheeled and the fore and aft
section disintegrated among trailing flames.
   But 185 of Captain Haynes' passengers survived. Air safety
authorities labeled it a heroic and miraculous piloting job. His
own matter-of-fact declaration that there was no hero, only people
doing their jobs, fit him becomingly.
   Not many people are capable, but he gives the impression that
many more could be.

   Daily Record, Morristown, N.J., on a national environmental
policy:
   If President Bush really wants to be the ``environmental
president,'' he could start by developing an environmental policy.
   What we have now is federal regulatory bureaucracy pushing
stringent environmental standards in response to public concern,
while the economic facts of life make meeting those standards near
impossible.
   Mayor John Bullard of New Bedford, Mass., speaking before a
joint session of the environmental and public works subcommittees
on environmental protection, said his city is under court order to
spend $560 million on clean water projects to meet federal
standards.
   Disarray can also be seen in comparing Bush's June 12 clean air
proposal with the administration bill that followed it. Critics
contend the bill falls short of the rhetoric on almost every point.
   We need a national policy that commits us to a goal of reduced
pollution and cleaning up existing pollution. It needs to be
realistic, too, recognizing that while cost of not cleaning the
environment is our eventual destruction, the cost of cleaning up is
no small potatoes.

   Times-West Virginian, Fairmont, W.Va., on a Florida rape case:
   Sometimes the system goes haywire.
   Take the case of the Fort Lauderdale woman who was raped and
then jailed because she was reluctant to testify against the
alleged rapist.
   The judge authorized police to take her into custody. She was
apprehended by police, screaming and struggling as three
plainclothes detectives jumped from a car and grabbed her.
   Keep in mind that this was the victim of the crime, not the
suspect.
   The woman thought she was being kidnapped again.
   She spent six days in prison and when she finally appeared
before the circuit judge, he scolded her for ignoring her
``obligation to appear in court.''
   The woman was victimized not only by the rapist, but also by the
system.

   The Milwaukee Journal on using aluminum baseball bats:
   The same baseball fans who objected to lights in Wrigley Field,
domed stadiums and artificial turf are sure to get up in arms over
reports that aluminum bats may be introduced into the big leagues.
Aside from whatever value preserving tradition may hold, keeping
metal bats away from major league baseball makes common sense.
   Despite its many changes in recent years, baseball remains
pretty much the same game it has always been. For that reason, fans
can reasonably argue whether Wade Boggs is a better hitter than
Rogers Hornsby was and whether Bob Feller could make it in today's
big leagues.
   But aluminum bats would change the game much more drastically
than even the designated hitter has changed it. Because they have a
larger sweet spot than wooden bats, aluminum bats can turn mediocre
hitters into good ones and good ones into superior ones. Thus,
aluminum bats would change baseball in a fundamental way.
   But they wouldn't improve it. On the contrary, giving hitters
unprecedented new clout would upset the delicate balance between
pitcher and batter that gives baseball some of its drama and makes
it so much fun.
   Aluminum bats don't break, and that makes them suitable for
sandlot leagues, which have to worry about money. But they don't
belong in the senior circuit.

<HEAD>Consultants Were Paid $5.7 Million in HUD Projects</HEAD>

   Twenty consultants earned more than $5.7
million by helping funnel much of the money in a federal housing
program to developers in a handful of states that didn't need it, a
Senate committee was told today.
   Most of the 20 consultants were former employees of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development or well-connected
Republicans, HUD Inspector General Paul Adams said in a report to
the Senate Banking Committee.
   The consultants were paid by developers to help them get about
one-fifth of the money from a HUD program to repair housing for the
poor.
   ``It's so lucrative now that you're going to get some people
doing some pretty unsavory things to feed at that trough,'' Donald
Terner, president of the non-profit Bridge Housing Corp. in San
Francisco, told the Senate committee.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill today, the House Government Operations
subcommittee on housing voted 6-0 to subpoena Lance Wilson, a
former aide to former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. Wilson had
been scheduled to voluntarily testify last week, but did not
appear, saying that he wasn't prepared with legal counsel.
   And on the Senate floor, the two party leaders sparred over the
HUD scandal, with Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, saying
the department was ``used as a political slush fund where political
appointees gave favors ... to politically well-connected
individuals.''
   Mitchell also criticized the leadership of HUD in the Reagan
administration for not heeding the warnings of the inspector
general.
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., then complained that
appointments to several of the appointments to those posts have
been bottled up awaiting confirmation by the Senate.
   ``Let's make certain we understand that Congress hasn't been
very cooperative,'' Dole said. ``Now we've got a situation where
Secretary (Jack) Kemp is trying to do the right thing, and he
doesn't have anybody on board.''
   The Senate Banking Committee voted 17-0 today to approve one of
those appointees, C. Austin Fitts, as an assistant HUD secretary.
The nomination of Ms. Fitts, who would replace Thomas Demery, one
of the central figures in the HUD scandal, now goes to the full
Senate.
   Adams, who conducted the HUD study at the request of Sen. Donald
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Banking Committee, said the
well is starting to run dry for the outside consultants.
   ``During our survey, five developers informed us that because of
all the recent media attention, some billings were not paid in
full'' to them, Adams wrote in his report.
   One of those consultants was Fred Bush, ambassador-designate to
Luxembourg, who has had $45,000 in payments withheld since April,
the report said. Bush, who is no relation to the president but was
the chief fund-raiser for his 1988 campaign, was paid $215,000 to
help land HUD funds for developers.
   Joseph Strauss, a former assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce Jr., made nearly $1.7 million _ more than any other
consultant found by Adams' inquiry.
   Others included former Interior Secretary James Watt, who got
$300,000; former HUD Secretary and now U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills, who received $138,445; and Paul Manafort, a lobbyist
and Republican political strategist, who got $442,000.
   Adams has reported before on the use of consultants in obtaining
funds from HUD, but the new report is the first attempt to
determine the extent and expense of the practice.
   Under the HUD program, developers were eligible for tax credits
and could get HUD to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwise
couldn't afford it.
   ``Developers often received windfall profits through tax credit
syndication,'' Adams wrote. Excess payments for rent subsidies
could cost the government more than $413 million by 1999, he said.
   In all, 51 projects with a total of 7,268 apartments funded
since October 1983 used consultants, Adams' report found. That
accounts for about 20 percent of all HUD's work in this area during
that time.
   Of those projects involving consultants, 45 were put in states _
notably, Colorado, Oklahoma, Nevada and Wyoming _ that would not
have qualified for the funds if HUD's formulas for determining
eligibility had been used, the report said.
   But the two largest states, California and New York, were
shortchanged by about 27 percent each, the report said.
   Meanwhile, a related study by the General Accounting Office said
developers were willing to pay high fees to the consultants because
the structure and oversight of the HUD programs made them virtually
no-lose propositions.
   ``In this manner developers were able to realize substantial
gains on their limited investments while undertaking very little
risk,'' wrote John M. Ols Jr., who prepared the report.

<HEAD>Police Kill Suspected Guerrilla in Namibia, Capture Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today shot and killed a black
man during a raid on his house and said the Soviet-made arms they
found there indicate that SWAPO guerrillas are smuggling arms into
Namibia from Angola.
   Kierie du Rand, chief inspector of the South African-ruled
territory, said the suspected guerrilla, Petrus Joseph, was shot in
the northern border town of Rundu when he brandished a pistol while
trying to escape after his arrest.
   Du Rand said police found Soviet-made explosives, a detonator
and a hand grenade in Joseph's home in the town 180 miles northeast
of Windhoek.
   Members of the United Nations contingent monitoring Namibia's
transition to independence could not be located to accompany the
police patrol on its mission, Du Rand said.
   He said the incident proves SWAPO guerrillas are crossing the
border from Angola, where their bases are, to establish arms caches
in northern Namibia and that U.N. troops are unable to monitor the
situation.
   Under a multinational agreement linked to the U.N. independence
plan, SWAPO guerrillas are to remain at bases at least 100 miles
inside Angola or return to Namibia as unarmed civilians.
   Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization have
accused the South African-led territorial police of harassing and
intimidating the movement's supporters.
   More than 5,000 U.N. military and police personnel have been
deployed in Namibia to supervise the campaign leading to
pre-independence elections in November. SWAPO, which began a bush
war against South African rule in 1966, is favored to get the most
votes in the election.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's hard-line Communist
rulers have allowed the domestic branch of the PEN writers' club to
reopen, and its board will include banned and officially-sanctioned
authors, participants said today.
   Ivan Klima, a dissident writer, said he and about 20 colleagues
gathered Tuesday in Prague and elected a new club governing
committee. He said both he and banned playwright Vaclav Havel are
included in the panel.
   Klima himself was banned after the 1968 reforms known as the
``Prague Spring'' were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion. The Czech
branch of the international writers' club became dormant around
1971 in the wake of broad purges of party members, including many
writers.
   Police detained Havel for about three hours Tuesday but released
him in time to allow him to appear at the end of the meeting, Klima
and another participant said.
   Two members of the human rights group Charter 77, Eva Kanturkova
and Milan Simecka, were summoned to police for questioning to
coincide with Tuesday's meeting, thus preventing their attendance,
Klima said.
   However, the official news agency, CTK, signaled authorities'
approval of the PEN club project by briefly reporting that it was
being formed again.
   Klima said 10 writers were elected to the club's governing
committee, or board of directors: six dissident or non-conformist
writers and four older, officially-backed writers. The CTK report
did not discuss the board's makeup.
   One of the official writers, Jiri Mucha, was elected chairman in
what Klima described as a compromise between the official and
banned writers.
   The efforts to restart the PEN club are the first such joint
initiative in Czech literature in almost 20 years.
   Klima said he saw it as ``a very good sign'' that the club was
permitted to resume activity. He said he hopes it can negotiate
with authorities on publishing previously banned books and lifting
curbs on banned writers.
   Over the past year, authorities have made small shifts toward
liberalizing the arts. Books by Franz Kafka have appeared for only
the second time in 20 years, and a number of previously banned
films, plays and rock bands were allowed to be seen.
   Writers such as Havel, however, have remained banned because of
their refusal to renounce political activities, according to
officials.
   In May, the 60-chapter international PEN association voted
unanimously to admit a Russian chapter, ending a long quarrel with
Moscow.
   Soviet participation in the 10,000-member group has been an
issue ever since PEN _ an acronym for Poets, Playwrights, Editors,
Essayists and Novelists _ turned down an application by the Soviet
state in 1924.
   PEN, which champions freedom of speech for writers, had kept out
the Soviet Union because of its persecution of writers and other
intellectuals.
   Klima said the Czech club will hold its first annual meeting
next year.

<HEAD>Student Expelled for Leading University Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student who defied martial law regulations by
helping stage a demonstration at Beijing University last month has
been expelled and refused his diploma, university officials said.
   A public announcement, posted on bulletin boards once festooned
with the posters of the student-led pro-democracy movement, said
Xiong Dayong, 22, had broken regulations banning unauthorized
gatherings.
   With no diploma and an expulsion on his record, Xiong probably
will have difficulty finding work.
   The notice, dated July 25, said Xiong, a fourth-year student of
Chinese and a member of the Communist Party's Youth League,
``incited other students to cause trouble by breaking martial law
restrictions.''
   It also accused Xiong of being a ``known criminal,'' stealing
three bicycles this summer and causing a drunken brawl last year.
   On July 23, 300 to 400 students sang and beat pots and pans to
mourn classmates killed June 3-4, when troops moved into Beijing to
crush the pro-democracy movement.
   The students said they held the demonstration because they felt
oppressed by ideological study classes they were forced to attend
following the crackdown and because some of them were refused
permission to join the work units they were assigned to.
   Most college graduates in China are assigned jobs by the
government.
   Most of the 32,000 graduates from 80 universities and colleges
in Beijing this year have been accepted by their assigned units,
the official Xinhua news agency reported today.
   The report said more than 1,000 graduates, however, had not
found appropriate jobs, in part because some companies had dropped
plans to accept hundreds of students.
   The report did not say whether the refusals were due to
political considerations arising from the pro-democracy
demonstrations, which began in April and were initiated and led by
students from Beijing universities.
   Also today, Chinese newspapers said the government announced it
would inspect the nation's 14.5 million private businesses in a bid
to recover almost $5 billion in revenues lost through tax evasion.
   The State Taxation Bureau will check the books and tax
registrations of private industrial, commercial and service
enterprises in August and September for signs of tax evasion or
other illegal activities, newspapers reported.
   Tax bureau director Jin Xin said illegal businesses would be
closed and illegal income confiscated.
   The government also is cracking down on corrupt tax collectors,
who are now prohibited from accepting gifts from tax-free and
tax-reduced businesses to help ``ensure an honest and clean
government,'' the official Xinhua news agency said.
   The restrictions are part of a national anti-corruption drive
triggered by the student democracy movement, which included demands
for an end to official corruption.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani to be Sworn in as President Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hashemi Rafsanjani will be sworn in as
the Islamic Republic's fifth president on Thursday, Tehran radio
reported Wednesday.
   The broadcast said Rafsanjani's credentials will be presented in
a ceremony to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the incumbent president who
took over as the country's spiritual leader after Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's death June 3.
   Although Khamenei's second four-year term doesn't expire until
October, he had been expected to step down sooner.
   The state-run radio report, monitored in Cyprus, did not say
whether Thursday's ceremony meant that Rafsanjani would start his
duties as president immediately.
   Rafsanjani, the 54-year-old speaker of parliament, won a
landslide victory in Friday's presidential elections, capturing
94.5 percent of the vote.
   Constitutional reforms approved in a referendum alongside the
election give him considerably enlarged powers by scrapping Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi's post.
   Earlier this week, Khamenei told Musavi to continue his duties
as prime minister until a new cabinet is set up by Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjani is considered a pragmatist who would like to ease
tight governmental control of the economy, and resume ties with the
West.
   The presidential elections, originally due to be held Aug. 18,
were moved up about three weeks to hasten the transfer of power
after Khomeini's death.
   Khamenei's decision to step down as president before the end of
his term appeared aimed at allowing Rafsanjani move quickly to
start reforming Iran's sluggish economy.

   Shops were empty today, the day after the
government introduced a controversial ``marketization'' plan that
raised some food prices by 300 percent by cutting subsidies,
newspapers reported.
   ``The first day after `marketization' was a day of rest for the
sales clerks in the majority of stores,'' reported the opposition
daily Gazeta Wyborcza in an article entitled, ``Much More Expensive
on the Empty Shelves.''
   The government on Tuesday announced the highest official meat
price increases in recent memory and the cost of other key food
items also skyrocketed. Shoppers had stripped shops in late July in
anticipation of the increases and August deliveries have been
meager.
   A report today in Zycie Warszawy, an official daily in the
capital, said sales clerks hoped deliveries would improve in the
next two to three days. But the report added that farmers were
still waiting for higher prices before delivering goods to market.
   ``Where is the meat?'' cried out an old man in a store on
Tuesday.
   ``There is no meat, just the price list,'' a woman complained.
   In a speech to parliament today, to present his economic plan
before he was elected prime minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak said
drastic measures would have to be adopted to prevent the danger of
economic destabilization.
   Solidarity lawmakers charge that the policies of the previous
government of Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, elected first secretary of
the Communist Party over the weekend, are responsible for the
current economic chaos.
   Authorities said the increases are needed to prompt farmers to
deliver their meat and produce to the market and to stabilize the
level of state subsidies to the food industry.
   Price increases occur regularly in Poland, but the scale of the
latest boost drove many customers to despair. In the past, major
price increases on food have led to rioting in Poland.
   The price of pork roast, an expensive and popular cut, rose from
$1.18 to $4.64 a kilogram (2.2 pounds). Sugar went up from 42 cents
to 60 cents a kilogram, but was unavailable in many shops. Butter
was up from 27 cents for a quarter kilogram to 48 cents. Flour
increased from 7 cents a kilogram to 12 cents. The average monthly
income in Poland is $127.
   Parliament on Monday passed legislation designed to cushion
consumers from the impact of price increases, and inflation now
rising at an estimated 160 percent rate annually.
   The law calls for incomes of workers, farmers and pensioners, to
be automatically conmpensated by 80 percent of the rise in the cost
of living.

   Tabor and three other officers went to the store after a burglar
alarm sounded. They found a broken window and a man trying to hide
behind the counter.
   Tabor called for the canine unit and told the man they would be
sending in a dog to get him out of the store.
   ``There was no immediate response. At that point, the report
says Officer Tabor barked vigorously,'' said Sgt. Ken Ruppert. That
brought the man out and he was arrested.

<TEXT>
   Delta Airlines won't appeal a $399 award to
Mayor Ed Hendler who complained he wasn't allowed to smoke on a
flight.
   ``We'd basically just like to forget about it,'' Delta spokesman
Jim Lundy in Atlanta said Tuesday. ``It would be more trouble and
more expensive than it's worth to go through the appeal process.''
   Hendler sued Delta after his March flight from Salt Lake City to
Washington, D.C., was declared non-smoking just before takeoff to
accommodate two passengers.
   In small claims court in Pasco last month, Hendler was awarded
the ticket price of $376 and $23 for court costs. Hendler
originally sought three times the ticket price.
   Delta does not fear Hendler's victory will inspire similar
lawsuits, and does not plan to change its policies, Lundy said.
Federal law says airlines must provide ``a sufficient number of
seats in the no-smoking sections of the aircraft for all persons
who wish to be seated there, and expansion of no-smoking areas to
meet demand.''
   About 15 percent of Delta's seats typically are for smokers,
Lundy said. The carrier occasionally cancels smoking sections, but
Hendler was the first to sue, Lundy said.
   Hendler said that if the airline reserves seats for smokers, it
should honor that commitment. ``The principle is breach of
contract. That is the basis of the suit,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Measure Would Take Funds from Federal Agencies for War on
Drugs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 11th graf, bgng, The interceptors, with
Senate voting to limit amendments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, struggling toward passage of a
$295 billion defense authorization bill, voted today to pay for the
war on drugs with an infusion of unspent dollars from government
agencies _ including the Pentagon.
   The 90-9 vote, taken as the Senate worked into the early morning
hours, would authorize the transfer of $1.7 billion from all but a
short list of exempted federal programs to pay the full cost of
keeping the government's promise to fight ``the epidemic of
narcotics sweeping this country.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said the action, if approved by the House
and enacted into law, puts the problem of paying for the drug war
squarely on President Bush's shoulders.
   ``This amendment authorizes the president to fund the drug
package,'' Byrd said. ``It says: `Mr. President, when it passes
into law, it's your baby. You fund the war on drugs. If you don't
like it, find another way.'''
   In other action before adjourning at 2:50 a.m. EDT, the Senate:
   _Voted to give air police last-resort permission to shoot down
aircraft flying narcotics into the United States.
   _Adopted a series of ``burden-sharing'' amendments aimed at
increasing the contributions to defense by U.S. allies in Europe
and Asia.
   _Bolstered Bush's bid to make the MX missile a moving rather
than a stationary target by shelving, 62-38, an amendment slicing
$502 million from the funds available to place the force of 50
missiles on railway cars.
   _Turned aside an attempt to bring to an immediate vote an
amendment restoring the military pension lost when former Marine
Lt. Col. Oliver L. North was convicted on three felony counts in
the Iran-Contra affair. As a compromise, it ordered the Senate
Judiciary Committee to hold hearings and report on the contentious
issue by Nov. 1.
   When the Senate resumed consideration of the defense bill this
morning, lawmakers voted 53-44 to turn aside an amendment that
would earmark $100 million for the effective deployment of 100
ground-based interceptors in Grand Forks, N.D., by 1995.
   The interceptors, part of the Accidental Launch Protection
System, would be used against sudden terrorist missile attacks.
   The Senate also voted 84-13 to limit the number of amendments on
the defense bill to those that are germane to the subject, thus
shortening debate.
   Lawmakers took that step after an amendment regarding tests of
anti-satellite systems was deemed not germane to the defense bill
because of technical reasons.
   After a rancorous debate earlier, the Senate declined to support
an amendment to siphon $450 million from the authorization for the
Star Wars strategic defense initiative for the war on drugs.
   Instead, it approved the compromise drafted by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee as a
desperation move to guarantee the drug war will be fully funded.
   Nunn said his amendment would keep the promises of the drug bill
passed last year by shifting unspent balances in federal programs
left over at the end of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   The measure exempts entitlement programs, including Social
Security, Medicare, and subsidized housing. But all other
government programs and agencies would be compelled to contribute.
   ``This is not the best way to fund the drug bill and I hope
another way will be found,'' Nunn said. ``But this will do the job.
   ``This says, before you spend money on other things you've got
to fund the drug bill.''
   Several senators complained that such popular programs as
student aid and education for the handicapped would be ``sharply
and severely'' cut by the amendment.
   But Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del. told the Senate: ``I'm a
realist. I know there is no way to get the money out of Star Wars.
... I have no hesitation of choosing money for the war on drugs
over student aid, over any other thing in the entire budget.''
   Biden, rhetorically addressing Bush, complained the
administration had not kept promises to fully fund the drug war.
   ``You've given us cardboard cops, you've given us cardboard
prisons, you've given us nothing, Mr. President,'' Biden said,
adding that while Bush has vowed not to increase taxes, the
American people want the drug war paid for, no matter the cost.
   Voting against the amendment were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., Bennett Johnston,
D-La., Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., John
Kerry, D-Mass., Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., and James McClure,
R-Idaho. Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., did not vote because he had to
leave for a family emergency.
   In a flurry of early morning action, the Senate by voice vote
adopted a series of amendments intended to press U.S. allies into
accepting a greater share of the defense burden.
   One issues a warning to NATO that the United States may reduce
U.S. troop strength in Europe if the alliance unilaterally cuts its
strength in the absence of negotiated troop reductions by the
Soviet Union.
   Another calls on Japan to boost defense and foreign-aid spending
and requires the president to negotiate an agreement providing for
Japan to completely offset the costs of maintaining U.S. forces to
defend Japanese territory.
   A third directs the president to prepare a five-year plan for
the U.S. military presence in South Korea, including a discussion
``of the feasibility and desirability of partial, gradual
reductions in U.S. military personnel stationed there.''

   A bus driver lost control of his
vehicle while he apparently was racing a colleague and it skidded
off a bridge into a ravine, killing 16 people and injuring 35
others, authorities said.
   The bus, owned by the Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines,
was carrying 60 workers to their forest assignments in Surigao del
Sur province when the accident occurred, according to reports from
the military and the company.
   The bus tore through the railing of the bridge and plunged into
a ravine, according to company spokesman Ernie Mendoza.
   The driver apparently was racing with another company bus that
was following closely behind, Mendoza said.
   The paper manufacturing company is based in Bislig, 570 miles
southeast of the Manila capital and 100 miles northeast of Davao.

<HEAD>Study Raises New Concern About Estrogen-Breast Cancer Link</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who try to reduce their risk of fractures
and heart disease by taking estrogen supplements for many years
after menopause may slightly increase their chances of breast
cancer, a study concludes.
   Some experts said doctors may have to consider the possibility
of cancer when weighing the risks and benefits of putting women on
estrogen after menopause. However, they caution that the evidence
of a cancer link is still weak.
   ``In my opinion, the data are not conclusive enough to warrant
any immediate change in the way we approach hormone replacement,''
said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of the University of California,
San Diego.
   The study, based on 23,244 Swedish women, found that users had a
10 percent overall increase in their risk of breast cancer after
six years of taking the hormone.
   However, the risk varied, depending on the kind of estrogen that
women used. Those who took estradiol, the most commonly used
variety in Sweden, had nearly double the usual risk of breast
cancer. But the researchers found no increased risk among the
relatively small numbers who used conjugated estrogens, which are
most frequently prescribed in the United States.
   Doctors often prescribe estrogen in combination with the hormone
progestin in the belief that this will minimize any increase in the
risk of uterine cancer, which also is associated with estrogen use.
However, the Swedish study raised the possibility that this
combination may actually heighten the risk of breast cancer.
   Women in the study who had used the combination for more than
six years had four times the usual risk of breast cancer, but the
number of women studied was too small to be statistically
meaningful.
   ``This article raises concern about the new regimens,'' noted
Dr. Lynn Rosenberg of the Sloan Epidemiology Unit at Boston
University. ``Combination therapy is becoming increasingly popular
and recommended.''
   The study, like other research, found no danger from brief use
of estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms during
menopause.
   The study was directed by Dr. Leif Bergkvist of University
Hospital in Uppsala, Sweden, and published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Evidence of a link between estrogen and breast cancer is
conflicting. More than 20 studies have found no sign of an
association, but a few others suggest there may be a link.
   Estrogen is widely prescribed to older women to reduce their
risk of heart disease and to stop osteoporosis, which leads to
broken bones. Some doctors recommended that women take the hormone
for the rest of their lives.
   ``This is an important public health question,'' said Dr.
Charles Hennekens of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ``The
breast cancer finding, if confirmed, would certainly be something
that the physician would have to weigh in deciding whether to give
estrogen.''

   More than 200 black and Indian
patients, supported by throngs of protesters, were treated at
segregated white hospitals today as the anti-apartheid movement
launched a nationwide defiance campaign.
   The campaign, in which other major protests are planned before
and after next month's segregated elections, is seen as the most
ambitious civil disobedience initiative in the country in nearly 30
years.
   ``The defiance campaign will be taken to every corner and every
section of society until apartheid is unworkable,'' said Jay
Naidoo, leader of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
largest anti-apartheid labor federation, at a rally in Johannesburg.
   At major hospitals in Johannesburg and Durban, patients ranging
from babies to grandmothers in wheelchairs were admitted for
treatment. Hospital officials, trying to avoid confrontations, said
they would not turn away anyone who appeared in genuine need of
medical care.
   Twelve white women supporting the protest were arrested in
Johannesburg, but no violence was reported at any of the eight
hospitals targeted by the Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of
anti-apartheid groups that planned the defiance campaign.
   Murphy Morobe, a leader of the United Democratic Front, South
Africa's main anti-apartheid alliance before it was banned last
year, told reporters the hospital protest is ``a major victory''
and praised doctors who cooperated.
   In the port city of Durban, more than 1,000 protesters staged an
illegal demonstration near Addington Hospital while 140 blacks and
Indians, under the direction of senior anti-apartheid leaders, were
admitted for out-patient care. ``Apartheid Makes Us Sick,'' said
one of the posters carried at the rally.
   The first protester to enter Addington was Mariam Jagga, an
elderly Indian woman in a wheelchair.
   By midday, 48 blacks were admitted to Johannesburg General
Hospital, according to a spokesman, and 100 supporters staged a
rally at an adjoining medical school. Like Addington, Johannesburg
General regularly admits some blacks for emergency care and
specialized treatment, but it has a policy of transferring them to
less well-equipped black hospitals as soon as feasible.
   Dr. Reg Broekmann, superintendent of Johannesburg General, said
about 11 percent of his 830 current patients were black.
   Dasoo noted that the blacks were admitted within an hour at
Johannesburg General, much quicker than the normal processing time
at badly overcrowded Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, the region's
main facility for black patients.
   The campaign that began today is widely viewed as the most
ambitious in South Africa since a sporadic but long-running
campaign in the 1950s to encourare defiance of apartheid laws.
   Those protests ended in March 1960, when police gunfire killed
69 blacks participating in a peaceful demonstration against the
now-abolished pass laws that restricted blacks' freedom of movement.
   Anti-apartheid groups have organized several one-day or two-day
nationwide general strikes in recent years and a widespread hunger
strike early this year by hundreds of detainees resulted in the
release of virtually all of them.
   Hospital segregation, however, has never before been the target
of coordinated protests.
   The protests today were smaller or non-existent at the six
targeted hospitals outside Johannesburg and Durban. Activists said
some would-be protesters were stopped at police roadblocks.
   Nine blacks were admitted to a white hospital in Pretoria, 15 in
Vereeniging and a few others in the conservative mining town of
Krugersdorp, where medical segregation has been enforced firmly.
   ``Without intervention such as this, these people wouldn't even
get to see a doctor,'' said Audrey Coleman, a white activist who
was at Paardekraal.
   Protest organizers said their goal is not merely to enable some
blacks to get treatment at the white hospitals but to abolish the
use of race as a criterion for obtaining health care.
   Dasoo said he and his colleagues would ``protest most strongly''
if blacks admitted to Johannesburg General today were transferred
to segregated black hospitals later.
   Large contingents of police were deployed at the targeted
hospitals, and 12 white women of the Black Sash civil rights group
were arrested in Johannesburg while staging an outdoor
demonstration protesting segregated hospitals.
   They later were released, and police said a decision would be
made whether they would be charged with violating laws restricting
outdoor protests.

   Tropical Storm Dean developed into a hurricane with
winds of 78 mph today as it surged westward toward the Caribbean.
   At noon EDT, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season was
centered near 17.5 degrees north latitude and 59.5 degrees west
longitude, or 425 miles east of San Juan, Puerto Rico, rushing
westward across the Atlantic at 20 mph.
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Lesser Antilles from
Guadeloupe to the U.S. Virgin Islands, said the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables. A hurricane watch was in effect for Puerto
Rico, Dominica and Martinique.
   ``It's very warm water. There's not anything in the atmosphere
to cause it to break up, so basically it looks good for further
development,'' said meteorologist Jesse Moore. ``Right now, it's
away from any land area, but it could affect the easternmost
islands of the Lesser Antilles within the next 6 to 12 hours.''
   Rainfall of 5-10 inches and tides 3 to 5 feet above normal were
possible.
   South Florida could be in danger in three or four days from
Dean, which is called a Cape Verde storm because it formed off the
west coast of Africa.
   ``When we see a hurricane like that we realize that it has the
potential to move all the way across the Atlantic and threaten the
southeastern United States,'' said hurricane center forecaster
Miles Lawrence.
   Chantal, the first hurricane of the season, was downgraded to a
tropical depression Tuesday night after hitting Texas near High
Island, midway between Galveston and Port Arthur. It was blamed for
at least two deaths.
   Dean began Monday as the fifth tropical depression of the
season. It became a named storm Monday night when its winds reached
39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes when their top sustained
winds hit 74 mph.
   Three other depressions have grown into named storms since the
season began June 1.

   The Boeing Co., halfway through a record year,
opened contract talks today with union leaders who say they want a
wage increase to replace all or some of the productivity bonuses of
the past six years.
   Negotiations between Boeing and the Machinists union, which
represents 57,800 workers in Seattle, Wichita, Kan., and Portland,
Ore., began by tradition in Wichita.
   ``All we want is our fair share,'' said Ron Eldridge, a
Machinists business representative in Wichita.
   Aerospace industry analysts say the union is in a strong
position because of a $67 billion backlog of commercial airplane
orders, $346 million in profits in the first half of 1989 and a
shortage of skilled workers that forced Boeing to borrow 600
Lockheed Corp. employees earlier this year.
   Analysts said the chance of a strike is small among Boeing
workers.
   ``This is the opportunity of a lifetime to get all the overtime
they can,'' said William Deatherage, analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   Union officials say they want a wage increase, likely to be in
the double-digits, to replace all or some of the yearly bonuses
that have ranged from 3 percent to 12 percent since 1983. The
current three-year contract expires Oct. 3.
   Except for welders, the people who make Boeing planes earn $8.88
to $18.42 an hour. The average wage is $13.50 to $14 an hour.
   ``All the signals are that it looks good for us. Boeing can well
afford to pay an increase in wages and increase benefits,'' said
Machinists union District 751 president Tom Baker of Seattle.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder refused to comment on the
negotiations.

<HEAD>Train Convoy Carrying Relief to South to Move Sunday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A train loaded with 1,350 tons of relief
supplies for famine-wracked southern Sudan will start its
long-delayed mission Sunday, the country's relief commissioner said
Wednesday.
   Kamel Shawki made the announcement a day after southern rebels
cleared the way for the departure by guaranteeing the train's
safety.
   Bandits and hungry villagers attacked two previous trainloads of
food and other relief goods as they rolled through rebel-held
territory, seizing much of the supplies.
   U.N. officials organizing Operation Lifeline Sudan, a relief
operation to prevent 100,000 starving deaths during the current
rainy season, had vowed that the third convoy would not move
without assurances of safety from the rebels. It had been supposed
to have left July 17.
   The trains move food from stockpiles in Babanousa, the northern
rail terminus 435 miles southwest of Khartoum, to Aweil in Bahr
el-Ghazal region 170 miles south of Babanousa. Aweil is a center
for displaced people in southern Sudan.
   Shawki also said the much-delayed departure of 15 barges would
move soon with supplies for Malakal, a Nile River regional capital
420 miles south of Khartoum.
   He said the government has approved Operation Lifeline's
application for the barges to drop off supplies to rebel-held
settlements during its trip but that the rebels had not yet
responded to the offer.
   The non-Moslem Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms
against the Moslem-dominated government in 1983, demanding autonomy
and administrative and economic reforms. The fighting created a
famine that killed 250,000 people in 1988 alone, according to U.N.
figures.
   The United Nations warned of 100,000 potential deaths this year
unless the south received 105,000 tons of food before summer rains
isolated large areas. The rains began in July and will continue
until November.
   The U.N.-coordinated Operation Lifeline Sudan started in April.
Shawki and the United Nations say 85 percent of the supplies have
been transported.

   A black priest today announced that he has
joined suspended black priest Rev. George A. Stallings in setting
up an African-American Catholic congregation.
   Stallings, who has criticized the Catholic Church for not
meeting the needs of its multi-ethnic congregation, said the Rev.
Bruce Greening would assist him as a minister and in forming a
school at the month-old Imani Temple.
   ``What is happening at Imani Temple is in my opinion the right
method to take,'' said Greening, who is assigned to the Catholic
Diocese of Richmond. ``I would like to challenge other black
priests and other black sisters to do the same.''
   Richmond Bishop Walter F. Sullivan issued a statement saying he
regrets Father Greening's decision to join Imani Temple.
   ``By the very fact of his free decision, Father Greening
automatically disassociates himself from the Diocese of Richmond,''
said Sullivan. ``I am relieving him of his duties as principal of
St. Mary's Academy in Norfolk, effective immediately.''
   Julie Sulik, spokeswoman of the diocese, said Sullivan does not
have the authority to suspend Greening from that diocese because he
is assigned to the Society of the Divine Saviour in Milwaukee, Wis.
Greening was working at the Norfolk school on a trial basis until
he decided whether he wanted to remain there, Sulik said.
   Milwaukee church officials could not be reached for comment.
   Stallings said the congregation of the Imani Temple would be
meeting Aug. 19 to discuss the issues they feel should be at the
forefront of the church's agenda.
   ``We are going to make sure that when we do deal with those
issues they are going to be embraced by the people, not handed
down,'' Stallings said.
   ``We're going to look at teen-age pregnancy and the drug
epidemic in our community,'' he said. ``We see these issues as
being systematic of greater issues in our society.'' Other
priorities for the black community were unemployment and education,
Stallings said.
   He also said the Imani Temple has received several requests from
other cities to help them establish an African-American
congregation there.
   Stallings said although he has his eye set on certain cities he
felt would respond enthusiastically, he first wanted to set the
groundwork for the ``Mother Church.''

   A U.N. envoy arrived in south Lebanon
today to try to find the body of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, who reportedly was hanged by his Shiite Moslem captors.
Another American hostage was given a reprieve.
   The envoy, Marrack Goulding, said he also would work on winning
freedom for other hostages in Lebanon.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said it
killed Higgins on Monday in retaliation for Israel's refusal to
free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by
Israeli commandos July 28.
   Israel's defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, today defended the
abduction and said the government considered the dangers to
hostages in Lebanon before approving it.
   Rabin also said interrogation of Obeid revealed he played a
central role in Higgins' abduction.
   After talks with President Bush, Pope John Paul II agreed to
intervene to seek the return to the United States of Higgins' body.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds American
hostage Joseph Cicippio, said it would kill Cicippio on Tuesday at
11 a.m. EDT unless Israel had freed Obeid. It then extended the
deadline 48 hours.
   Shiite sources in Lebanon, speaking on condition they not be
further identified, said today they believed Iran may have stepped
in to save Cicippio because of the international uproar over
Higgins' reported hanging.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth released a crude
videotape Monday purportedly showing Higgins hanging, but there was
no way of knowing when the tape was made.
   Rabin said today Israel had unconfirmed reports Higgins was
killed ``months ago.''
   Goulding, the U.N. undersecretary-general in charge of
peacekeeping, stopped in Israel en route to Lebanon and told
reporters, ``My mission is to find out what happened to Col.
Higgins and to see what can be done to bring about the release of
the other hostages.''
   Higgins, 44, was commander of an observer team attached to the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon when he was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988.
   Goulding flew to UNIFIL's Lebanon headquarters, in the border
town of Naqoura, and went into immediate talks with the UNIFIL
commander, Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren.
   Goulding was scheduled to visit Beirut on Thursday and meet with
Lebanese leaders, including some Shiites. UNIFIL spokesman Timur
Goksel refused to name the leaders.
   ``There are no negotiations involved, although he has a
secondary mission of trying to find out about other hostages in
Lebanon,'' Goksel said.
   In announcing the extension for Cicippio, the Revolutionary
Justice Organization acknowledged a plea from Cicippio's Lebanese
wife, Elham, and cited ``friendly appeals and sincere behests.''
   ``The Iranians probably are bringing immense pressure on their
Lebanese surrogates, seeking to defuse the crisis generated by
Higgins' murder,'' one Shiite source in Lebanon said, speaking on
condition he not be identified.
   Iran is the financial and spiritual backer of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, the fundamentalist faction believed to be the
umbrella for groups holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in
Lebanon.
   The Shiite source noted that Revolutionary Justice has used
death threats in the past to back political demands but never has
killed a hostage.
   ``Even if it was a postponement for only one minute, it's better
than nothing,'' said Elham Cicippio, who married Cicippio after he
converted to Islam in 1985.
   Cicippio, 58, was acting comptroller of the American University
of Beirut when he was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   The statement announcing the reprieve was accompanied by a
photograph of another American hostage, Edward Austin Tracy, 58, a
self-styled wanderer and writer kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986. It was the
first picture of him released since March 8.
   There are four other Americans among the foreigners held in
Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Rabin today repeated Israel's offer to swap Obeid and Lebanese
Shiite Moslem prisoners held in Israel for Israeli soldiers and the
foreigners held in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, of which Obeid is reported to be a leader, has
rejected a swap.
   Rabin said Obeid admitted under interrogation that Higgins'
three abductors were at his home in south Lebanon the night before
the kidnap. He quoted Obeid as saying the kidnappers' car was
hidden in his garage for a month.
   Earlier reports said Higgins was held for two days in Obeid's
house.
   Rabin said the kidnap of Obeid was approved two months ago,
after ``every grain of possibility for dialogue'' had been
exhausted on winning the release of three Israeli POWs captured in
south Lebanon.
   ``We took into consideration all the possible reactions,'' he
said. ``We saw them all, including the actions that already took
place, and ones even worse.''
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal later told The Associated Press,
however, that the decision to approve the kidnap did not rest on
outside implications. ``Consideration was only given to getting our
soldiers back,'' he said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Iran's president-elect, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, discussed the Obeid abduction and Higgins' purported
death with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Tehran.
   Tass said Rafsanjani voiced ``deep regret over what has happened
and confirmed that Iran does not have (any) relation to the tragedy
...'' It said both men favored ``urgent measures'' to prevent the
situation from worsening.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, claimed
today Rafsanjani directly controls the groups holding hostages and
that he dispatched his brother to help oversee their activities,
including the ``execution'' of Higgins.

   A Piedmont Airlines jet carrying 100
people made an emergency landing with its left wing and engine
scraping the runway today after its landing gear jammed, officials
said. No injuries were reported.
   A flash of flame and smoke erupted from the left wing as the
jet, a new Boeing 737 en route to Charlotte from Washington,
touched down at Piedmont Triad International Airport about 10:55
a.m. with its left landing gear up.
   Passengers slid down emergency chutes, and ground crews sprayed
foam on the engine.
   ``I was thinking that this might be it,'' said a passenger, Pam
Schaeffer of Washington. She said she sat next to a former flight
attendant who kept her informed of what the crew was doing. ``Once
I was out of the plane and on the runway and far from the plane, I
started to feel OK.''
   Flight 1489, carrying 94 passengers and a crew of six, was to
have landed at Charlotte at 9:30 a.m., the airline said.
   The plane was diverted to Greensboro, the site of Piedmont's
maintenance hangar, after the instrument panel indicated the
landing gear had not locked, officials said. The landing was
carried live by a statewide TV network of six stations.
   The pilot ``circled for better than an hour in an attempt to get
all the gear down,'' said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Roger Myers. The pilot got the nose wheel and right landing gear
down, but not the left gear, Myers said.
   Emergency vehicles lined the runway, awaiting the landing, and
the airport closed to other traffic. Airline spokesman David
Shipley said the pilot burned off most of his fuel to reduce the
risk of fire. He said there was not enough time to foam the runway
beforehand.
   Before landing, the pilot touched the plane down briefly to test
its landing gear, and that indicated the nose wheel and right
landing gear were locked in proper position, said Piedmont
spokeswoman Nancy Vaughan.
   The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate to
determine the cause of the malfunction, Myers said.
   Passenger Debbie McDorman of Washington said the crew notified
passengers of the problem around 9:45 a.m. and began maneuvering to
free the stuck landing gear.
   ``They would drop and circle a couple of times to try and shake
it free, or shake from side to side,'' Ms. McDorman said. ``It's a
really weird feeling.''
   She said passengers were calm.
   ``I kind of kidded around in the beginning and then I got really
scared. When they started doing the maneuvers I said, `This is
getting serious,''' she said. But she said she believed the landing
would come off without difficulty.
   ``I know that any pilot that's worth his salt can land an
aircraft without wheels,'' she said.
   Shipley said that the plane was manufactured in November 1988.
Airline records show no maintenance problems with the plane or the
737-400 series of which it is a part, he said.

   Ferrugia, 38, signed a multiyear contract with KCNC, reportedly
worth about $200,000 a year.
   Ferrugia told The Denver Post he and his wife, Mona, decided to
move West for family reasons, especially concerning their
2-year-old son Jonathan.
   ``I counted 21 days in January and 19 days in February that I
was on the road. I calculated I was working a 70-hour week,
including about 17 hours a week on an airplane or to and from an
airplane. At a certain point you have to evaluate what's important.
... My first priority has always been family,'' Ferrugia said.
   His past assignments included the White House and Justice
Department beats, the civil war in Lebanon, martial law in Poland
and American political conventions.

<HEAD>US Was Investigating Von Karajan's Nazi Past, Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan was
under investigation by the Justice Department over allegations of
involvement in Nazi persecution, but the case against him was
dropped when he died last month, a government lawyer said Wednesday.
   Had he lived, ``there might have been a question of the
watchlist'' _ putting the famed musician on a list of people banned
from the United States for their Nazi pasts _ said Neal M. Sher who
heads the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations.
   Among the allegations were that von Karajan might have worked
for the Nazi security police and had a role in ridding German
orchestras of Jews and other ``non-Aryans,'' said Sher.
   The investigation was begun several months ago, before von
Karajan died in Austria on July 16 at the age of 81, Sher said.
   ``We were looking at what his role in Nazi persecution might
have been,'' said Sher. ``I don't know where the investigation
would have led, but there might have been a question of the
watchlist.''
   Thousands of people have been placed on the list, including
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim. The office investigated him in
1986 and reached a finding that played a role in Nazi persecution
during World War II while he served as an intelligence officer.
   Von Karajan joined the fledgling Nazi Party in 1933 in Austria
and then rejoined in 1934 when he moved to Germany, Sher said.
Under the sponsorship of Hermann Goering, the field marshal who
founded the Gestapo, von Karajan's career flourished.
   ``He was the cultural showpiece of the most horrendous regime
ever. At the time they were throwing people in the ovens he was
holding concerts,'' Sher said.
   To say von Karajan was just an artist ``is a revisionist view of
history,'' Sher said.
   For two years after the war ended in 1945 von Karajan was banned
from performing by the Allied powers who occupied Germany, because
of his collaboration with the Nazis. His first tour of the United
States in 1954, at the head of the Berlin Philharmonic which he
conducted for 34 years, was greeted by widespread protests.
   Von Karajan was a frequent visitor to the United States, the
last time in February, Sher said.
   ``There were many questions about him that deserved answers,''
but with his death the case has been closed, he said.

   Owners of a pro-communist bookstore have
asked the Police Commission to investigate their claim that police
have harassed, intimidated and spied on the staff and discouraged
customers.
   A complaint was filed Tuesday on behalf of Libros Revolucion by
the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern
California.
   The complaint claims that bookstore workers have been detained
by police for political reasons and its patrons have been
threatened and discouraged from entering the store.
   ACLU attorney Paul Hoffman called on the Board of Police
Commissioners to investigate the allegations that the Police
Department is acting out an orchestrated plan to make it difficult
for the store to operate.
   A police spokesman, Cmdr. William Booth, denied the department
engages in ``institutional harassment.'' He said all specific
allegations made by the ACLU will be investigated.

<HEAD>Protest Campaign Starts; 200 Blacks Treated at `White' Hospitals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 blacks and
Asians were treated at whites-only hospitals Wednesday as the
anti-apartheid movement launched its most ambitious civil
disobedience campaign in nearly 30 years.
   Patients ranging from babies to grandmothers in wheelchairs were
admitted for treatment, most of them at hospitals in Durban and
Johannesburg. Hospital officials, trying to avoid confrontations,
did not turn away anyone who appeared in genuine need of medical
care.
   ``We see the campaign today as a major victory,'' said Murphy
Morobe, a leader of the Mass Democratic Movement, a loosely
organzied coalition of anti-apartheid groups that arranged the
protests.
   ``We proved that we did not intend to cause violence or disrupt
medical services, but to help the government remove the albatross
of apartheid,'' he said at a news conference.
   Morobe said the campaign will include other major protests
before next month's segregated parliamentary elections, but refused
to say what form they would take or when they would begin.
   The government claims the campaign is part of an effort to
violently disrupt the Sept. 6 elections for the tricameral
parliament which has separate chambers for whites, Asians and
people of mixed race, but excludes the 28 million black majority.
   The Mass Democratic Movement has accused authorities of a
``hysterical response'' and has pledged that its actions will be
non-violent.
   The last sustained defiance campaigns were conducted in the
1950s and ended in March 1960 when police shot and killed 69 blacks
participating in a peaceful protest against the now-abolished pass
laws that restricted blacks' freedom of movement.
   Anti-apartheid groups have organized several one- and two-day
nationwide general strikes in recent years, and a widespread hunger
strike earlier this year by hundreds of detainees resulted in the
release of virtually all of them.
   Organizers said the new campaign would last indefinitely.
   ``The defiance campaign will be taken to every corner and every
section of society until apartheid is unworkable,'' said Jay
Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, the nation's largest labor federation.
   Twelve white women supporting Wednesday's protest were arrested
briefly in Johannesburg, but no violence was reported at any of the
eight targeted hospitals.
   In Durban, more than 1,000 protesters staged an illegal
demonstration near Addington Hospital, while about 140 blacks and
Indians, under the direction of senior anti-apartheid leaders, were
admitted for out-patient treatment. ``Apartheid Makes Us Sick,''
said one poster carried at the rally.
   The first protester to enter Addington was Mariam Jagga, an
elderly Indian woman in a wheelchair.
   At Johannesburg General Hospital, about 50 blacks were admitted
for treatment, and hundreds of supporters staged a rally at an
adjoining medical school.
   Like Addington, Johannesburg General regularly admits some
blacks for emergency care and specialized treatment, but has a
policy of transferring them to less well-equipped black hospitals
as soon as feasible.
   Dr. Reg Broekmann, superintendent of Johannesburg General, said
about 11 percent of his 830 patients were black.
   Johannesburg General's occupancy is about 50 percent, while the
only full-service hospital in the Soweto township outside
Johannesburg is so overcrowded that hundreds of patients sleep on
the floors.
   ``As of today, the Mass Democratic Movement considers all health
facilities in South Africa open (to all races),'' said Aslam Dasoo,
a doctor who helped organize the protest.
   The protests were smaller at the six targeted hospitals outside
Johannesburg and Durban. Activists said some would-be protesters
were stopped at police roadblocks.
   In related developments:
   _ Seventeen activists in Cape Town announced that on Sunday they
will begin defying restrictions imposed on them following their
recent release from detention. Like many ex-detainees, they are
required to remain in their homes at night and to report daily to
police.
   _ The National Union of Mineworkers said its members are
attempting to use facilities reserved for whites, including
bathrooms, cafeterias and buses.
   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites control the country's
political system and the economy and maintain segregated
neighborhoods and schools.

<HEAD>Attorney General Urges Approval of International Drug Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh urged a
Senate panel Wednesday to ratify an international anti-drug
trafficking treaty.
   The pact will ``provide us with enhanced law enforcement tools
and can lead to substantial advances in our international
cooperative efforts'' to counter the illegal drug market,
Thornburgh told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The attorney general signed the U.N. Convention Against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances on behalf of
the United States last December in Vienna.
   The treaty includes a provision under which ``all the nations
signing the convention have agreed to exchange evidence of criminal
conduct and to extradite accused traffickers so that safe havens
are no longer so readily available,'' he said.
   However, Thornburgh noted in response to questions from Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., that the treaty does not obligate countries
to extradite their own nationals wanted on drug-related charges in
other countries.
   ``The convention in and of itself is not going to provide a
remedy to the extradition problem of Colombia,'' where the Supreme
Court several years ago declared unconstitutional its extradition
treaty with the United States that allowed drug traffickers to
remain there when they were wanted on charges in the United States,
he said.
   In addition, Thornburgh told Sen. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., D-Del.,
that the treaty would allow the United States to withhold
investigative information from governments it perceives to be
corrupt, even if they have signed the document.
   ``I think we would have no hesitation about doing that ...,''
Thornburgh said. ``Our obligation to our own citizens would
transcend'' the treaty requirement to share information.
   Thornburgh said the president would decide whether the United
States should seek extradition of someone overseas wanted on drug
charges here when the State Department doesn't want that to occur.
   ``I have not had such a case arise,'' Thornburgh told Biden.
``The obvious instinct of a prosecutor ... is to prosecute.
However, all of us recognize the prosecutions may have to be
foregone for national security reasons.''
   Mel Levitsky, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, attended the hearing but did not comment.
   Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was indicted by two
federal grand juries on drug-trafficking charges in Florida last
year, before Thornburgh became attorney general. The State
Department reportedly offered to drop the criminal charges against
Noriega if he would step down from power in Panama.
   The treaty calls for extradition of accused drug traffickers and
the exchange of law enforcement information. It also seeks to lift
``the veil of bank secrecy'' to help uncover money-laundering
operations, requires supervision of the manufacturing and sale of
chemicals used in the production of illegal drugs, mandates that
commercial carriers ensure their cargos are free of drugs, and
reaffirms the need for aggressive efforts in crop eradication and
demand reduction, Thornburgh said.
   The agreement requires each signatory to pass laws outlawing
drug trafficking and money laudering while enabling the countries
to seize drug profits, but the laws of each country would take
precedence.
   Thornburgh noted that all legislation by each country is
``subject to their constitutional principles and basic concepts of
their legal systems.''
   The treaty, Thornburgh said, ``will assist in the eradication of
drugs and drug-producing laboratories, and in preventing the
transportation of precursor chemicals from this nation and others
to the drug-producing countries for use in drug production.
   ``The convention will also help to hinder the importation of
drugs into the United States, and prevent the transfer of the
profits of the illegal drug trade back to the drug cartels,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Cavazos Gets Cool Reception from Hawkins on Education Initiatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos got a
cool reception from a House committee chairman Wednesday when he
sought support for proposals emphasizing parental involvement that
he said are needed to revitalize school systems.
   Although initiatives outlined by Cavazos have been embraced in
principle by the Senate education panel and the House
Appropriations Committee, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., made
clear he was not impressed.
   Hawkins, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, told
Cavazos he sees ``some dangerous trends in the proposals being
advocated.''
   For example, he characterized what he called a ``so-called
parental choice'' approach to school selection for their children
as ``a very dangerous idea that has not been fully scrutinized.''
   On the administration proposal to encourage a new category of
magnet schools targeted at school systems with major dropout and
drug abuse problems, Hawkins said that ``takes us far afield from
trying to improve schools for all children rather than a few.''
   ``The selling of choice reminds me of the medicine man selling
snake oil,'' said Hawkins.
   The veteran committee chairman has been a major force in most of
the federal education legislation passed in recent years.
   Cavazos said:
   ``We have been aware of (problems) for a long time, but nothing
has happened. We have got to start changing the system itself. What
I'm trying to do is open up to this nation the whole idea of
restructuring our education system and I think choice is a major
part of that.''
   In his prepared testimony, Cavazos had said, ``The fact that we
now outspend most countries in education does not, in any way, make
up for the fact that when it comes to solid results, our students
and our schools overall simply aren't cutting it.''
   While not disputing committee figures that the federal share of
education spending has dropped from 8 percent to 6 percent over the
past decade, Cavazos said inflation-adjusted spending by all levels
of government is up 26 percent since 1982 _ to $199 billion last
year on elementary and secondary education alone.
   Outlining the federal role as mainly one of stimulating
education approaches with the best chance of working, Cavazos said:
``We have not made progress by putting in more money. We need to
totally change the system. We just cannot go on doing it the way we
are doing it now.''
   Rep. Dale E. Kildee, D-Mich., said he was concerned about many
administration proposals because ``I think what we're talking about
is reversing our commitment to desegregation.''
   While not attacking Cavazos' proposals specifically, Kildee
cited the Senate Judiciary Committee's rejection Tuesday of William
Lucas of Detroit for the top civil rights job at the Justice
Department as the Senate ``reading signs'' in the executive and
judicial branch of a general relaxation of devotion to civil rights.
   ``This a great worry to Congress,'' said Kildee.
   The main program in the proposed legislation that drew Hawkins'
criticism would authorize $100 million a year to promote what
Cavazos called ``open enrollment through parental choice'' as a new
category of magnet schools that would not necessarily be intended
to promote desegregation or attract only top scholars.
   ``Magnet schools work,'' said Cavazos, and ``George Bush and I
want to find ways to expand magnet schools and other examples of
choice all across this country.''
   The legislation also would enable the Education Department to
study other ``choice'' programs and recommend those that work best.
   The secretary complimented Hawkins' home state and said,
``Several models of choice are being implemented in California,
including schools-within-a-school and special schools with a
subject matter focus. Interdistrict choice is allowed if both
school districts involved agree.''

   A former Tamil rebel leader traveled
to New Delhi on Wednesday to help negotiate an accord on
withdrawing Indian peacekeeping troops from Sri Lanka.
   In New Delhi, a government spokesman said Foreign Minister
Ranjan Wijeratne of Sri Lanka met with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi for two hours.
   The spokesman said the former Tamil rebel, Vartharaja Perumal,
and five other ethnic Tamils from Sri Lanka would be in New Delhi
on Thursday for consultations but would not take part in the talks.
Perumal is chief minister of the Northeastern Provincial Council in
Sri Lanka.
   On this island off India's southern coast, more ethnic violence
was reported. In central and southern Sri Lanka, Sinhalese
extremists have killed seven people since Tuesday, military sources
said.
   Sinhalese radicals have carried out an anti-India campaign to
protest the presence of about 45,000 Indian peacekeepers in the
Tamil-dominated north and east.
   In Colombo, fire destroyed 25 shops owned by Tamils of Indian
descent, police said. No casualties were reported from the Tuesday
night fire, the cause of which was under investigation.
   Wijeratne and a six-member delegation came to New Delhi on
Saturday to discuss a timetable for the pullout of the troops. They
were deployed under a failed 1987 peace accord sponsored by India.
   India says more power must be transferred to the Tamil-dominated
provincial council to fulfill the terms of the 1987 accord before
its troops leave.
   Sinhalese extremists say the Indian troops have compromised this
country's independence. They also say the government in Colombo has
granted too many concessions to the Tamils.
   The government has blamed the extremists for killing at least
4,000 people, mostly officials of the government and its
supporters. About 11,000 other people have died in the Tamil
insurrection that began in 1983.
   In an effort to quell the violence, President Ranasinghe
Premadasa's government asked India to withdraw its soldiers by July
29.
   On Saturday, India pulled out a small number of troops, and the
two countries agreed to negotiate a withdrawal for the remaining
soldiers.
   The Tamil guerrillas are fighting for an independent homeland in
the north and east.
   India became involved because its own 60 million Tamils are
sympathetic to the demands of Sri Lankan Tamils, who account for 18
percent of this country's 16 million people.
   Tamils contend they are discriminated against in jobs and
education by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and the military.

   A jury today ruled that Home Shopping
Network libeled GTE Corp. in blaming the telephone equipment
company for lost sales, and it awarded GTE $100 million.
   HSN had charged that GTE didn't give it adequate equipment to
handle a large volume of calls in 1986 and 1987 as the TV network
expanded into 11 new markets. But the six-member Circuit Court jury
disagreed.
   The jury awarded $50 million each to GTE Florida and GTE
Communications after five hours of deliberations. The jury said $20
million should by paid by HSN and $40 million apiece by its
chairman and its president.
   HSN, which offers items for sale to TV viewers, had sued in
1987, claiming it lost millions of telephone calls and about $500
million in potential sales because its GTE equipment was
insufficient for the volume of calls.
   GETE, based in Stamford, Conn., countered with a slander and
libel suit blaming HSN's troubles on its own mismanagement.
   GTE lawyer Roy Reardon said HSN had failed to mention its plans
to buy 11 UHF stations in 1986, which, combined with its entry into
the cable TV market, caused subscribers to soar from 9 million to
46.5 million in one year.
   Competition from similar retailers also hurt HSN, Reardon said.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Wednesday approved $1 billion in
emergency funds to battle algae that is fouling beaches on the
Adriatic coast and driving tourists away.
   Part of the money will be used to build water purifiers and
sewage treatment plants along the coast and to reduce the amount of
agricultural pollutants coming from the Po River.
   The decree, approved by the Senate earlier this month, passed
the Chamber of Deputies by a 320-19 vote, with 17 legislators
abstaining.
   The algae has dealt a serious blow to the Adriatic tourism
industry, creating a dirty sea and deserted beaches. The Federation
of Italian Hotel and Tour Operators has predicted that the 1989
season's losses could total $197 million and the number of tourists
could fall 30 percent from last summer.
   The enviromentalist Greens Party voted against the decree,
criticizing the funds as insufficient.

<TEXT>
   Rock star Billy Joel says he no longer cares for
his early 1970s cult hit ``Captain Jack'' or his popular song ``My
Life,'' which he describes as childishly redundant.
   ``My Life'' is ``a song that turned out sour for me ... just
like some of your kids turn into bums,'' he told a master class at
the Performing Arts Center of Long Island University's Southampton
campus on Monday.
   ``Captain Jack,'' a song about adolescent drug abuse, ``kind of
burned me out quick,'' he added.
   The master class was open to the public and included Art
Garfunkel. Joel made it clear his professional career, not his
private life, was the topic of the day.
   ``Usually, somebody wants to know, `What does Christie look like
in the morning?''' he said, referring to his wife, model Christie
Brinkley. ``She looks good, so let's get that out of the way.''
   Joel said he writes his music first, composing the melody to
what he called ``bail-out lyrics'' that establish a song's phrasing.
   As he was working on the first verse of ``Just the Way You
Are,'' he said, the lyrics went:
   ``Don't be crazy, don't be lazy
   Don't bring me chicken soup alone.
   I'm not hungry, I'm not thirsty...''
   Later, when he wrote the real words, Joel said, he thought the
phrase ``What will it take 'til you believe in me _ The way that I
believe in you'' was essential to its success.
   ``That edge of anxiety made it a more meaningful song,'' he said.
   Joel, who signed a contract as a young musician that gave away
his rights to his early songs, said his advice to newcomers to the
field was ``to get a lawyer.''
   ``Then I'd tell them to hire another lawyer to watch the first
lawyer.
   ``There's a great deal of dishonesty and greed, and musicians
tend to be naive about this business,'' he said.

<HEAD>GE To Hold Back Freon to Offset Releases From Refrigerator Repairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. has agreed to hold back
up to 300,000 pounds of ozone-depleting freon to offset the release
of the gas from a refrigerator repair program, it was announced
Wednesday.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., who negotiated with GE officials,
said the arrangement was ``breaking new ground,'' because it would
mean ``real reductions in the volume of CFC's (chlorofluorocarbons)
now being released into our air.''
   Jim Allen, a spokesman for GE's appliance division in
Louisville, Ky., said he expected the offset would take place next
year after completion of the program to replace compressors in
nearly a million large-size refrigerators sold in 1987-88.
   GE is replacing the compressors, which drive the coolant system,
in customers' homes. But during that process, about five ounces of
freon are released. The freon joins other CFC's in floating towards
the stratosphere, where the chemicals can destroy the paper-thin
ozone layer.
   While ozone is the chief ingredient of smog when close to the
ground, it protects against ultraviolet radiation at higher levels.
If a hole in the ozone layer develops and increased radiation comes
through, it could cause more cases of skin cancer and eye
cataracts, depressed human immune systems and reduced crop yields,
according to scientists and the Environmental Protection Agency.
   CFC's also have been implicated in global warming, in which the
earth's heat is trapped, causing temperature increases, droughts,
heat waves and a rise in sea levels.
   Gore has introduced legislation to reduce and eventually ban
ozone-depleting chemicals, which already are headed for a 50
percent worldwide reduction by the end of the century under an
international agreement.
   Allen, the GE spokesman, said the company hasn't decided exactly
how to offset the releases caused by repairs, but added that the
firm has pledged to ``take off the marketplace the amount we use in
the (replacement) program.''
   He said the company initiated the replacement program
voluntarily in January after testing showed that certain
compressors would not last the required 10 years.
   Gore and an official of an environmental research group told a
news conference that GE could have done more by using special
equipment to recapture the freon during repairs instead of
releasing it into the atmosphere.
   ``We are deeply disappointed by the company's refusal to stop
routine releases of CFC's,'' William Walsh, of the U.S. Public
Interest Group, said in a letter to GE. Walsh also was involved in
the negotiations.
   Allen said portable machines that could recapture the freon on
the spot are not widely available and are unable to recycle the gas
during the repair process.
   The negotiations with GE began after Lynda Draper of Ellicott
City, Md., complained when the freon was released in her kitchen.
   ``I was totally outraged,'' she said. Draper said she contacted
the public interest group after calls to GE brought no satisfactory
response. The public interest organization then contacted Gore.

   Rob Lowe's insurance company says the actor's
liability insurance doesn't cover sex tapes.
   Chubb Custom Insurance Co. of New Jersey filed papers in U.S.
District Court this week asking a judge to free it of any
obligation for claims in the lawsuit over Lowe's alleged
videotaping of a sex act involving a teen-age girl.
   Lowe is being sued by Lena A. Wilson of Marietta for allegedly
videotaping her daughter, Jan Parsons, then 16, in a sex act with
another female while Lowe was in Atlanta for the 1988 Democratic
Convention.
   Court documents indicated Lowe wrote Chubb on June 7 claiming
his $300,000 personal liability insurance policy requires the
company to ``provide a defense and to pay any judgment which might
be returned'' against him.
   Lowe, star of several movies including ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' was
covered for any bodily injury he caused another person and any
damages as a result of any injury, but not ``damage which is either
expected or intended,'' the company said.

   Malcolm S. Forbes, publisher, motorcycle maven
and hot-air balloonist, plans to launch a magazine aimed at
``zestfully awake'' people who live in big cities.
   The takeoff of Egg is set for spring, Forbes announced Tuesday.
   ``Symbolically,'' said Forbes, chairman of Forbes Inc., ``the
egg is the source of everything new.''
   ``Part of the essential nature of the magazine is going to be
the thrill of discovery,'' he said. ``Psychologically, you can
never be sure what's inside an egg. You have to open it. It might
be a Faberge egg.''
   Forbes is a collector of Faberge eggs.
   Egg is to appear 10 times a year and cover music, film, theater,
fashion, design, celebrities, society, food, wines and nightlife.
   It will be ``about the vibrant culture of those alive to the fun
of being alive,'' said Forbes.
   Hal Rubenstein, a regular contributor to magazines including
Details, 7 Days, Elle and The New Yorker, has been named editor of
Egg, Forbes said.
   Forbes' youngest son, Timothy, will be president of Egg. He is
president of American Heritage, another magazine published by the
company best known for its business biweekly, Forbes magazine.

   Bill Cosby has accepted an invitation to
perform a benefit concert for a new elementary school this
Panhandle city feared it couldn't afford.
   Oilman T. Boone Pickens said his wife, Bea, got the idea to
invite Cosby when his company was trying to find ways to fund the
``magnet'' school, which would aid integration using computer
programs to attract pupils to a mostly black neighborhood.
   ``He's well-known for his generosity, and he said he'd be glad
to help,'' Pickens said. ``We're glad we could be a part of it.''
   The concert will be Oct. 16 at the Amarillo Civic Center
Coliseum and all proceeds will go to the new elementary school.
   Plans to establish the school in a refurbished former high
school building had been scrapped as officials struggled to make up
a $5 million budget deficit. But Pickens' company announced it
would fund up to half of the school's cost for the first two years.

   Recent Rod Stewart and Beach
Boys-Chicago concerts drew overflow crowds to the 10,000-seat lawn
of the Pine Knob Music Theater, to the dismay of fans who got
jostled and had drinks spilled on them.
   ``We made a mistake, we oversold it and we shouldn't have done
it ... and we're sorry,'' Pine Knob operator Joseph Nederlander
said Tuesday.
   He said lawn seats were oversold to the tune of 1,500 to 2,000
spaces at each of the concerts last month. Pine Knob has been
selling as many lawn tickets as possible because of economic
pressures from other Detroit-area concert venues such as the
Palace, Joe Louis Arena and Meadow Brook, he said.
   Some of the patrons at the oversold shows reported receiving
refunds.

   Hedda Nussbaum, the battered woman known for her
testimony at the televised Joel Steinberg murder trial, will
display her photographs at a gallery this month in what her
psychiatrist calls ``a return to her identity.''
   Her 12 black-and-white nature photographs will be exhibited in
Sag Harbor on Long Island and will sell for $125 to $275. Ms.
Nussbaum calls the collection, including photos of a soft, white
rose and a rabbit, ``Signs of Life.''
   She and Steinberg were arrested in November 1986 in the beating
death of the 6-year-old girl they had raised in their Manhattan
home. Charges were dropped against Ms. Nussbaum, herself a beating
victim, but Steinberg was sentenced to up to 25 years in prison for
first-degree manslaughter.
   Samuel Klagsbrun, her psychiatrist at Four Winds Hospital, said
Ms. Nussbaum's ``artistic side began years ago when she wrote
children's stories. What happened is that during the worst time of
her life _ during her relationship with Joel Steinberg _ that part
of her life was squashed. This is a return to her identity.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, took the picures during the 18 months she was
in rehabilitation at Four Winds. She now lives a quiet life in
upstate New York. She works at home, developing her own prints.

<HEAD>Wildfires Threaten Idaho Hamlets, Burn 215,000 Acres in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB FICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flames pushed within 300 yards of the rustic
Sourdough Lodge and theatened two Idaho hamlets Wednesday, but
cooler weather was turning the tide against some of the wildfires
buring in five western states.
   ``It all depends on the wind,'' said Sourdough owner Bob Ahern,
who refused to leave his inn outside Lowman. ``If we don't get any
wind, we could walk away from this thing heads high. If the wind
changes, my friend, this is going to be one big black hole.''
   Wildfires have consumed more than 215,000 acres _ or 335 square
miles _ of timber, brush and grassland in the West since the middle
of last week, according to the Boise Interagency Fire Center, the
government's wildfire command post. Most were ignited by lightning.
   Big fires continued to burn Wednesday in Idaho and Oregon, while
smaller blazes were fought in California, Montana and Washington.
   In Idaho and Oregon, moist, cool air slowed the flames' advance.
   ``Those conditions really help suppression,'' Boise National
Forest spokeswoman Lynette Davis said. ``But then its supposed to
get hotter again by the weekend so we've got to get something done
before then.''
   More than 15,000 firefighters were on the lines throughout the
West, and reinforcements continued to arrive from outside the
region and from the military.
   Fifteen buses carrying 500 soldiers left the Army's Fort Lewis
on Wesdnesday to join the battle in eastern Oregon. The soldiers,
who got a crash course in fire safety, were to be joined by 500
more troops Thursday, said Capt. Don Herzog, spokesman for the fort
south of Tacoma, Wash.
   In Idaho, where 94,000 acres of timber and range have burned,
crews had to concentrate on protecting structures scattered
throughout the Boise, Payette and Nez Perce national forests rather
than on containing the flames.
   ``They save the structures first and fight the fires second,''
Ms. Davis said.
   Air tankers were dumping flame-retardant chemicals at a rate of
one-quarter of a million gallons of retardant a day on the most
stubborn of the blazes.
   Lowman, population 15, was largely leveled by flames over the
weekend, and shifting winds Wednesday renewed the threat to cabins
scattered near the town 70 miles northeast of Boise.
   Ahern at the Sourdough Lodge was one of the few to ignore the
Forest Service advice to leave. Fire crews poured so much soap-like
foam on the building that it took on a mid-winter snowy look. Even
the tops of the surrounding firs were white.
   The fire was so hot it melted asphalt on the highway, Idaho 21,
east and west of Lowman.
   Fire also neared the small mining town of Warren, 120 miles
north of Boise, where 16 of the 36 residents fled and the rest
prepared to move to an open area if the threat increased.
   Hundreds of firefighters ringed the town with 1,000 feet of
hose, putting sprinklers on each building as wind sent the fire
racing to within a mile of the buildings.
   The situation Wednesday elsewhere in the West:
   _ In eastern Oregon, where 85,000 acres have been blackened,
cool weather gave firefighters hope they could turn back several
big timber and range blazes, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Wendy Evans in Portland.
   Several smaller blazes were contained, and the spread of the
bigger fires around the towns of John Day, Baker and Enterprise had
stopped, she said.
   _ In California, a brush fire in the Cleveland National Forest
that has blackened 8,200 acres destroyed a house and a mobile home
was 50 percent contained Wednesday. More than 1,300 firefighters
supperted by air tankers and helicopters struggled in sporadic wind
and tough terrain to contain the blaze 90 miles southeast of Los
Angeles.
   In the Sierra Nevada foothills in central California, 3,000-acre
fire burned out of control in grass and brush, but didn't pose a
theat to structures.
   _ In Montana, firefighters were close to containing an 800-acre
grass and timber fire in the Custer National Forest. About 300
firefighters were working to cut lines around the blaze in the
southeastern corner of the state.
   _ In Washington, firefighters were mopping up the 850-acre
Lodgepole fire in the North Cascades near the Canadian border.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill Upping AIDS Spending, Blocking Sex Survey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation on Wednesday that
would boost federal AIDS spending to $1.6 billion but block a
survey of Americans' sexual habits that supporters said would help
determine how such diseases spread.
   The measure, passed 365-58 and sent to the Senate, increases
AIDS spending in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, by about 25
percent over this year's level. The money would be spread among
research, prevention, and treatment programs.
   But the report accompanying the bill prohibited the Public
Health Service from spending $11 million it had planned to use for
an extensive study of sexual behavior.
   There was no debate on the prohibition of the survey, which was
included by the House Appropriations labor, health and human
services and education subcommittee. But the report said the survey
``does not appear to be an appropriate use of federal funds,'' and
said such work, if needed, should be accomplished with private
money.
   ``The Public Health Service is directed not to proceed with this
study,'' the report said.
   The provisions were part of a bill providing $155.2 billion for
labor, health and education programs.
   Public health officials said the sexual behavior study would
allow them to learn more about how AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases are spread. The Kinsey Report, conducted in
1948, was the last thorough study of American sexual practices.
   A pilot questionnaire composed by the Health Service sought to
learn when participants had most recently had sex, what practices
they engaged in and whether their partner was male or female.
   Some Bush administration officials and conservative lawmakers
have opposed the survey, arguing that it would be an invasion of
privacy and that it is already clear that AIDS is spread through
sexual contact.
   Last month, the number of Americans diagnosed as having AIDS
surpassed the 100,000 mark. More than 58,000 of them have died.
   The legislation contains a large increase for the National
Institutes of Health, which would get a $534 million increase over
1989 levels to $7.7 billion. This includes $1.7 billion for cancer
research and $1.1 billion for work on heart and lung ailments.
   It provides $4.7 billion for jobs programs; $1.9 billion for
alcohol, drug abuse and mental health programs; and $5.6 billion
for education programs for disadvantaged students.
   It also grants $3.7 billion to the Guaranteed Student Loan
program for college students. Of that amount, $1.9 billion is for
the costs of loans on which students have defaulted.

   The smog over western Montana valleys
Wednesday was so unusual that the National Weather Service put out
a special advisory explaining to puzzled Montanans what the crud
was.
   Visibility in Helena was only six miles Wednesday morning,
virtually opaque by Montana standards. Tuesday afternoon, the
visibility was 40 miles.
   The weather service explained that the dirty air was ``a weather
phenomenon usually seen in the industrial eastern United States.''
   ``Generally speaking, high humdity, high pressure at the surface
and a high concentration of industrial pollutants combine in the
populated eastern United States to produce a milky dirty sky during
the day along with reduced visibilities,'' the weather service said
in an advisory that goes to subscribers such as radio stations or
newspapers.
   Smoke from Idaho forest fires drifted northeast and combined
with unusually humid and stagnant air over the mountains to bring a
touch of East Coast to the mountains.
   The weather service said morning smog was expected to continue
``as long as the forest fires continue in Idaho and as long as the
westerly upper level winds continue to bring the smoke into
Montana.''

   In the minutes before a Delta jet crashed on
takeoff last August, the crew joked that a plane wreck would one
day expose their gleeful cockpit conversation to the public.
   The tape made by the cockpit voice recorder on Flight 1141 was
released under a judge's order Tuesday, revealing crew member's
views on news coverage of other crashes, Jesse Jackson's politics
and Marilyn Quayle's looks. The conversation involved the cabin
crew and a flight attendant who was forbidden by law to be in the
cabin while the plane was in motion.
   Fourteen people were killed in the crash at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport. More than 90 passengers survived.
   At a hearing in November, National Transportation Safety Board
investigators rigorously questioned the crew about the apparent
idle nature of the conversation when they should have been going
over preflight checklists.
   District Judge Adolph Canales released the tape over objections
of a Delta Air Lines lawyer who argued the recording should be made
available only to parties in liability suits stemming from the
crash of the Boeing 727. Delta already has admitted that the flight
crew failed to properly set wing flaps for added lift before
takeoff.
   The nearly 10 minutes of conversation, deemed ``casual and
non-duty related'' and kept secret by the NTSB, was released at the
request of WFAA-TV.
   The only female voice on the recording was identified by a
special court master as that of flight attendant Mary O'Neill, who
survived the crash.
   Some of the talk apparently took place while the plane was
taxiing.
   Since 1981, the Federal Aviation Administration has had a
``sterile cockpit'' rule that prohibits any flight crew
conversation not related to the operation of the aircraft when the
plane is taxiing, and when it is flying below 10,000 feet in an
approach or departure. Flight attendants also are prohibited from
entering the cockpit during those periods.
   Henry A. Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association,
today backed off a threat to have pilots turn off voice recorders
until Congress bars release of the recordings.
   Duffy said at a news conference that he received assurances the
FAA and NTSB will seek such legislation.
   Prior to the news conference, Duffy said, ``If immediate and
direct action'' is not taken, ``I will be instructing our members
to deactivate their recording devices until this shameful abuse is
corrected.''
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said turning off the recorders would
violate FAA rules. He said the FAA has an agreement with pilots
that no enforcement action will be taken as a result of what is
said on the tapes.
   ``They are only an investigative tool,'' Leyden said.
   While the Delta flight crew waited for takeoff, an unidentified
crew member said, ``We forgot to discuss about the dating habits of
our flight attendants so we could get it on the recorder in case we
crashed.''
   ``Then the media would have some kind of a juicy tidbit,'' the
crew member said.
   That was a reference to Continental crew members who were said
to have discussed a flight attendant's dating habits before their
jet crashed on takeoff in Denver in 1987, killing 28 people.
   Delta last week accepted responsibility for the crash. It also
announced it had fired the flight's pilot, co-pilot and flight
engineer.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said Tuesday in Atlanta that Ms.
O'Neill, who is on medical leave due to crash injuries, has not
been disciplined. He refused to say if she would be subject to
penalties when she returns to a full schedule.
   The flight originated in Jackson, Miss., and was bound for Salt
Lake City after a stop at Dallas-Fort Worth.
   Crew members talked at length about the 1988 election and, in
reference to Jackson, one said, ``You know, it's scary that someone
like him could get as far as he did.''
   The conversation included exchanges about egrets that live at
the airport and about the news coverage of plane crashes and
elections.
   The talk also turned to vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle
and his wife, Marilyn. One criticized her looks, while another
praised her oratory skills.
   Of reporters, Ms. O'Neill said: ``They are such vultures, they
really are. They're too powerful, they really are.''
   The tape ends with a scream and the sound of the plane breaking
apart.

   A space shuttle will be lost and astronauts
may well die within the next decade if the United States carries
out its vision of exploring the universe, Congress was warned in a
report released Wednesday.
   ``If the United States wishes to send people into space on a
routine basis, the nation will have to accept the risks these
activities entail,'' said the study by the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment. ``If such risks are perceived to be too
high, the nation may decide to reduce its emphasis on placing
humans in space.''
   The price of increased space activity includes ``the likelihood
that loss of life will occur,'' the report said.
   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman of the House space science
subcommittee, told a news conference that the country must not
forget going into space is a risky business.
   ``Were there to be another major disaster it would certainly
shake the confidence of the American people,'' said Nelson, who has
flown in space himself.
   ``That was one of the ill-served byproducts of the extraordinary
success of the space shuttle for 24 flights in which it became so
routine in the mind of the American people _ that it was almost
like getting into your car and taking a Sunday afternoon drive _
when in fact it's anythin but that,'' he said.
   Nelson was a passenger on Columbia as it made the last shuttle
flight before a fireball engulfed Challenger in 1986 with a loss of
seven lives.
   ``Let's don't be overdramatic about this,'' said Nelson. ``It
doesn't have to be this horible explosion-type thing that occurred.
It could be the complete elimination of an orbiter in a mistake
made in preparation, a crane drops something on the fuselage and it
is suddenly out of commission for two or three years.''
   OTA said NASA could reduce some of the risks by building a fifth
orbiter, at a cost of $2.5 billion, including spare parts. Nelson
said he would favor adding to the fleet, which will be brought to
four ships when Endeavour _ the Challenger replacement _ is
finished in 1992.
   The OTA report, called ``Round Trip to Orbit: Human Space Flight
Alternatives,'' examines some of the policy choices Congress faces
in decisions for this century and the next.
   If Congress wants to reduce risks to the shuttle fleet during
assembly of the space station, OTA said, it could direct NASA to
buy Titan 4 launch vehicles or develop a so-called Shuttle-C launch
vehicle, which would use shuttle booster rockets and fuel tank to
orbit a huge cargo container.
   The report also laid out options to advance U.S. crew-carrying
capabilities beyond the shuttle era into the next century. They
include an Advanced Manned Launch System leading to an advanced
shuttle-like vehicle and a Personnel Launch system, which could
dispatch a crew-carrying vehicle from unpiloted launch rockets.
   An aerospace plane, able to take off from a runway and fly to
orbit, would be a major step forward, OTA said, but would be much
more expensive and a larger technical challenge.
   Space shuttle reliability to date, with one catastrophic failure
in 29 launches _ the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986 _ is
96.5 percent. A contractor estimated last year that a
representative chance of mission success is 98 percent.
   ``If reliability is and remains 98 percent, there would be a 50
percent chance of losing an orbiter on the next 34 flights, a 72
percent chance of losing an orbiter before the first space station
assembly flight and an 88 percent chance of losing an orbiter
before space station assembly is completed 42 flights later,'' said
OTA.
   It said those percentages differ from the risk faced by the crew
because the crew might escape in some situations where the orbiter
was lost.
   Current plans call for all hardware for the planned space
station to be carried into orbit in shuttle cargo holds, along with
astronauts who will do the assembly. Engineers have been talking,
though, of reducing the number of shuttle missions by carrying
parts into orbit on heavy-duty rockets.
   ``Continued dependence on only four orbiters could be risky,''
said the report. ``Launching each orbiter three or four times every
year creates a growing cumulative risk of accidents or `wear out;'
supporting the space station in addition to other crew-related
missions would be difficult if not impossible with fewer than four
orbiters.''

<HEAD>Man Charged With Failing To Pay Cocaine Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEWISTON, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man arrested in a cocaine bust has
become the first person charged under an Idaho law requiring
dealers to buy a tax stamp for their illegal drugs.
   Victor H. Smith, 23, is charged with cocaine possession and
failure to pay the special state tax on the drugs, which were found
July 3. He was freed on $500 bail.
   The law, which took effect July 1, requires purchase of tax
stamps on dealer quantities of cocaine, marijuana and other drugs.
Violations carry up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Steve Tobias, Nez Perce County prosecutor, said the arrest is
the first under the law, although the Tax Commission has initiated
civil penalties against one person.
   The stamps are about 2 inches square and are green for
marijuana, blue for controlled substances sold by quantity and red
for those sold by dosage. The stamps cost $3.50 per gram for
marijuana and $200 per gram for cocaine.
   The Tax Commission, which issues the stamps, is prohibited from
trying to establish the identity of the buyer.
   ``We will mail them to whatever address or post office box,''
said Steven Miller, commission chief of operations in Boise.
``There is absolutely no follow-up by this agency to obtain the
identity of the person.''
   Forty-two grams or more of marijuana and seven grams or more of
cocaine require tax stamps.
   The commission sold 93 stamps for marijuana in July. But Miller
said no stamps have been purchased for any other drugs.

Utilities customers when the Postal Service lost nearly $40,000

   But the Postal service put a little light back in the customers'

angry phone calls later.
   Postal Service officials acknowledge ``a failure in the postal

   The missing checks were worth $39,598.88. They were mailed June
23, promptly disappeared and then reappeared July 12.
   ``It's a shame it happened,'' Jerry Kindred, director of
marketing for the post office in West Palm Beach, said Tuesday.
``I'm sorry as all get-out about it.''
   Ten customers had their electricity cut off, said Brenda

customers received late notices and electricity cutoff warnings.
All were billed an extra $10 in late charges, later waived.

<HEAD>Arts Director Says Eight Chinese Performers Will Not Seek Political

   The director of a Chinese-American arts
organization in New York City said Wednesday that none of the eight
Chinese opera performers who vanished last week plans to apply for
political asylum.
   The entertainers are ``scared to death'' by the publicity their
disappearance has caused, said Alan Chow, executive director of the
Chinese American Arts Council.
   The fate of the entertainers, including seven opera stars and a
popular actor, has been unknown since the group fled the 28-member
Kun Opera company last week.
   Immigration officials in San Francisco said Wednesday they had
no connect with the performers.
   Chow, who would say only that he has ``some connection'' with
the performers, reported that four remained in San Francisco, two
are in New York City and two are in Washingon, D.C.
   All are staying with relatives or friends, said Chow, adding
that he was uncertain whether the performers had planned to flee
the opera group or acted spontaneously.
   Observers have speculated that the eight might be seeking
democratic and economic freedoms in the wake of the student-led
pro-democracy movement in China this spring.
   But Chow insisted that the artists will not seek asylum. It has
been common for performers from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to
arrive in the United States with a working visa and then apply for
a student visa to enable them to study in this country, he said.
   ``Those things always happen,'' said Chow. ``It's not too hard
to change their visa to a student visa in a regular case. Now it's
very bad.''
   The performers did not know the risk they faced in seeking such
a change following the government crackdown on the student
movement, Chow said. ``Now they found out and they're scared to
death.''
   Chow met the entertainers when they performed in New York last
month.
   Now, he is worried for their safety. ``It's a very bad position
if you just disappear. This timing is not right. You hurt not only
yourself, you hurt China.''

   President Bush said today he is ``leaving no
stone unturned'' in trying to free American hostages in the Middle
East but lacks hard information as he tries to deal with the crisis
``in a prudent way.''
   Bush said he had contacted many world leaders including British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and ``We have had assurance after
assurance... they want to help.''
   ``You can just rest assured that we're going about our business
in, I'd say, a prudent way,'' he said, declining to discuss any
specifics of what he had in mind.
   Asked at a photo session if he had information that hostages'
lives might be in danger in the wake of the reported execution of
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins by Shiite Moslem captors, Bush
replied:
   ``We are considering that that might well be the case, given
statements we have seen.''
   ``Please assume we are thinking prudently about this matter in
every way possible,'' and using diplomatic channels, the president
said. ``We're leaving no stone unturned.''
   However, he added, ``We're dealing with less than a full deck
when it comes to information. It is very hard when you're dealing
with this kind of cowardice and this kind of dastardly act to get
all the information that you need to make a decision ... We are not
dealing with all the facts.''
   Bush was asked if it would make matters easier if Israel
released the leading Moslem cleric whose kidnapping inflamed the
hostage situation and prompted threats against the eight Americans
held captive.
   Without directly criticizing Israel, the president repeated his
earlier call for a release of all hostages held by all parties in
the region.
   ``I think the release of everyone held against their will would
be a good thing,'' he said.
   Bush made the comments during a picture-taking session with
Sheik Mohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, the foreign minister of the
Persian Gulf state of Bahrain. The minister condemned the reported
killing of Higgins as an act against all humanity.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration is pleased with a statement Tuesday by Iran's
President-elect Ali Akbar Rafsanjani condemning Higgins' apparent
execution and all acts of a terrorist nature.
   She called on Rafsanjani to act ``in accordance with the
spirit'' of his statement. ``We remain convinced that Iran is in a
position to bring significant influence to bear on those who hold
the hostages and call on it to do so,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler also welcomed a statement by a top aide to
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat criticizing
the execution of Higgins.
   Asked about potential military action in light of the movement
of U.S. warships in the Middle East, Bush replied, ``We're
prudently planning.''
   However, his comments seemed to indicate he has made no
decisions on a plan of action.
   He said he was weighing the situation with ``a heavy heart'' and
that ``it transcends religion, it transcends alliances, it gets in
... to a matter that concerns that entire civilized world. So we
will keep on trying.''
   The president is getting help from the pope and seeking aid from
other world leaders to try to solve the Lebanon hostage crisis, but
the White House cautioned against hopes for a quick solution.
   Bush received his daily intelligence briefing this morning in
advance of a meeting with his top national security aides to assess
information coming from the Middle East.
   Meanwhile, the Vatican announced today that Pope John Paul II
has agreed to intervene to seek the return to the United States of
the body of Lt. Col. Higgins, whose reported hanging Monday by his
kidnappers in Lebanon precipitated the crisis.
   In a 12-minute telephone call Tuesday, Bush asked the pope to
intercede in getting the return of Higgins' body if, in fact, the
officer had been executed. ``His holiness expressed the willingness
of the Holy See to find a solution to this problem,'' a Vatican
statement said.
   Pentagon officials said today the USS Belknap, the flagship of
the U.S. 6th Fleet, and the fleet's commander canceled a scheduled
visit to the Soviet port of Sevastapol to be ``at the beck and
call'' of Bush in case he needs them. The aircraft carrier USS
America also has cut short a visit and left the port of Singapore,
officials said.
   But officials played down the possibility of a military strike
against hostage-holders. ``These are not necessarily bellicose
moves _ but we want to be ready in case we are needed. ...These are
prudent measures,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The risks appear to greatly outweigh the potential payoff'' of
any military strike, an official said Tuesday.
   And the White House went out of its way to avoid drama that
would make it appear a crisis was engulfing Bush's presidency.
   On Tuesday night the president went ahead with plans for a
jovial barbecue for Congress members on the White House lawn.
Appearing in shirtsleeves and leather-pocketed casual pants, the
president dined on ribs, chatted cheerfully with his picnic-table
companions and clapped to the lively tunes of the Oak Ridge Boys.
   ``These are not easy days, either in the Congress or in the
White House,'' Bush said in brief remarks. ``There are overwhelming
events that concern everybody here. But even though there are
complicated times, I think an evening like this with just plain
relaxation with friends is very, very significant and very
important.''
   Spokesman Fitzwater indicated a dramatic response was not
imminent. Rather, he said reporters should view the situation as
``a process for dealing with the situation over the long term and
not look for any quick decision points.''
   ``We don't want to create a crisis atmosphere,'' he said.
   Administration officials said they still had no firm
confirmation that Higgins was dead, as his Shiite terrorist captors
claimed Monday.
   Higgins' wife, Robin, said through a spokeswoman in Washington
she could not tell whether her husband was the man shown hanging in
a grisly videotape the kidnappers released.
   Besides telephoning the pope, Bush called Turkish Prime Minister
Turgut Ozal, while other U.S. officials contacted the Soviet Union
and other countries in the Middle East seeking assistance in
winning freedom for the remaining hostages.
   The United States also is going through intermediaries to seek
help from Iran, which is believed to have influence with kidnappers
who hold the hostages. The United States does not have formal
diplomatic relations with Iran.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said in Tehran that
Moscow would use its growing influence in Iran on behalf of the
hostages.

<HEAD>68 Killed in Jalalabad Fighting, Afghan Government Says</HEAD>

   Government forces pushed back
guerrilla fighters and took new territory near a stategic eastern
city during fighting that killed 68 people, the Foreign Ministry
said Wednesday.
   After nearly daily rocket barrages for a month, Kabul was quiet
for the second day as government forces rounded up suspected
guerrilla sympathizers and seized weapons in the capital area, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.
   On Tuesday, the government said 100 rockets were confiscated in
the area and 50 people were arrested. Amani said Wednesday that
three Egyptian Sakr-30 surface-to-surface rockets also were found
about 15 miles east of Kabul.
   Earlier Wednesday, about 200 Moslem religious leaders and their
followers demonstrated in Kabul to protest the rocket attacks. They
blamed them on the United States and Pakistan, which supply weapons
to the guerrillas.
   In Nangarhar province, government forces drove back guerrillas
fighters and seized new territory, Amani said. The provincial
capital is Jalalabad, an eastern city that the guerrillas have
twice failed to capture in offensives since Soviet soldiers
withdrew in February.
   Amani said fighting in Nangarhar province in the last 24 hours
had left 62 guerrillas dead and 93 wounded. He said six government
soldiers were killed and 12 wounded.
   In operations east of Samar Khel, about 12 miles southeast of
Jalalabad, government forces conducted search operations. Large
quantities of arms and ammunition were seized near Chapar Har
district, Amani said. He gave no numbers.
   ``The general condition of the war in Chapar Har and Samar Khel
is that the enemy is retreating,'' Amani said. ``But they are
backed by the heavy artillery of the 11th Division of the Pakistani
armed forces.''
   Neighboring Pakistan, which allows the guerrillas to be based on
its territory, denies it is fighting with them in the decade-old
civil war.
   There was no independent confirmation of any of Amani's reports.
   Amani also reported heavy clashes between supporters of rival
guerrilla groups in Tutum Dara in Parwan province north of Kabul.
He said there were ``a lot of casualties,'' but he gave no numbers.
   Among the groups involved was Hezb-e-islami and Jamiat-e-islami,
he said.
   The two fundamentalist groups have reportedly been engaged in a
power struggle recently. Guerrilla sources have said Hezb
supporters ambushed Jamiat forces on July 9 in the north and killed
30 of their fighters.
   The reported battles between the groups has raised new questions
about the ability of the guerrillas to overthrow the Marxist
government in Kabul.
   In Kabul, the Moslem leaders and their supporters demonstrated
outside the U.N. Good Offices Mission.
   ``American imperialists, die!'' they shouted while a small group
of protesters shook and banged the metal gates at the entrance to
U.N. office.
   The U.N. office was established to help oversee the Soviet
withdrawal. U.N. officials are also supposed to help the
governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan cut off arms supplies to
both sides of the war.
   Since June 25, more than 280 people have been killed and 745
injured in the rocket attacks and a car bombing in the Kabul area.

<HEAD>Dickinson Bill Would Restore North's Pension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Armed Services Committee's top
Republican introduced legislation Wednesday to restore the
$23,000-a-year pension former White House aide Oliver North lost
because of his felony convictions in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., said North, a 20-year Marine
veteran, has ``demonstrated his willingness to give his life for
his country'' and should not be asked ``to give up the security of
his own family on charges that may not have been his doing.''
   Dickinson's legislation would exempt North from a law that
denies retirement pay to any government officer convicted of
destroying government documents, one of three felony crimes for
which North was convicted.
   U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher on Monday rejected a
recommendation from the Navy that North's pension be restored,
saying there is ``serious doubt'' about whether North was entitled
to retirement pay.
   The Navy suspended North's pension when he was sentenced July 5
for his convictions on charges of aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress, accepting an illegal gratuity and altering
or destroying classified documents. He was fined $150,000 and
ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service.
   The Navy recommended that Bowsher restore North's pension after
the Navy's judge advocate general concluded that North as a retiree
should not be considered an officeholder under the terms of the
law. The Navy's general counsel had reached the opposite conclusion.
   James Hinchman, the General Accounting Office lawyer who
reviewed the Navy recommendation for Bowsher, said it was
``impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is serious doubt
that a retired regular officer'' convicted of destroying documents
can continue to receive retirement pay.
   Hinchman said the denial of retirement pay to North gives him
the right to file suit and seek a definitive ruling on whether the
law applies to him.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, offered an amendment to the fiscal
1990 defense bill Wednesday to restore North's pension. But the
Senate adopted a modified proposal from Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell requiring the Senate Judiciary Committee to study
the issue and report to the Senate by November.

   Yamid Reza Pahlavi, a younger brother of the
late Shah of Iran, grinned a toothless smile in the cell he shares
with 23 other convicts in notorious Evin prison and said, ``Things
could be worse.''
   Speaking in broken English to a group of foreign reporters on a
conducted tour of the prison in north Tehran, he said he was
serving a 10-year sentence ``for a family reason,'' but refused to
be more specific.
   He said he had seven more years to serve.
   Pahlavi, wearing a white T-shirt and gray pajama trousers, lay
sprawled on blankets spread on the cell floor. There were no beds
or any other furniture.
   Prison officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
prisoner had been disowned as a drug addict by Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi before the February 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the
monarchy.
   The shah fled Iran a month earlier, with other family members.
He underwent medical treatment for cancer in the United States,
then went to Panama and on to Egypt where he died in July 1980.
   The officials said Yamid Reza Pahlavi was arrested as a vagrant
and imprisoned three years ago.
   ``We are well-treated here,'' Pahlavi, 58, said, adding that he
was kept busy ``gardening and looking after roses.''
   Other inmates in his cell included a former general and senior
officials of the shah's regime who refused to give their names.
   Meeting the shah's brother was the highlight of Sunday's
conducted tour arranged by the Ministry of Islamic Guidance.
   In a bizarre incident, a Danish reporter was attacked by a
prison guard while the group was inspecting a block of empty cells.
   ``I was walking down a corridor when suddenly this man started
shouting in Farsi and then pushed me into a cell and started
beating me up,'' said Kurt Lyndorff, a correspondent for the Danish
newspaper Jyllands-Posten.
   Later, the guard, a bearded, middle-age man who refused to give
his name, started shouting that all the reporters on the tour were
CIA and KGB agents.
   The guard later apologized and said he pushed Lyndorff into a
cell because the reporter had refused to identify himself as part
of the group.
   The mostly Western journalists were among a limited number
allowed into Iran for the July 28 presidential elections.
   The reporters were shown one of a dozen empty blocks of cells in
the sprawling jail that held thousands of political prisoners in
the Islamic revolution's early days.
   Prison officials said the block was vacated after an amnesty
declared in February during celebrations of the revolution's 10th
anniversary.
   Hundreds of ``enemies of the revolution'' reportedly were
executed in the prison, set on a steep mountain slope in
fashionable north Tehran, across a narrow wooded valley from a
leading hotel, the Grand Azadi.
   The reporters were shown another block containing 12 large
cells, about 12 by 9 yards, each with 24 inmates. Each had a
television set but no furniture. The prisoners sprawled on
blankets, reading newspapers.
   Officials escorting the journalists refused to say how many
prisoners were in the jail. Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
said earlier at a news conference that the only political prisoners
left in Evin were those serving life sentences for capital crimes.
   Mohtashemi said most prisoners now were drug addicts or
narcotics peddlers jailed during an anti-drug crackdown launched by
the government in January.
   The reporters also were shown the prison workshop, where inmates
were making military uniforms and shoes.
   The Guidance Ministry provided interpreters so reporters could
converse with the prisoners. A few inmates spoke English.
   All those interviewed said they were jailed for political
offenses.
   One prisoner who gave his name as Mohammed Aragi said he was a
member of Iran's outlawed Tudeh Communist party.
   He said a revolutionary court sentenced him to death on charges
of spying for the Soviet Union, but his sentence was commuted to
life imprisonment under another amnesty declared by the late
revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Aragi, 56, said he also spent time in jail during the shah's
time for belonging to Tudeh but conditions were better under the
Islamic regime.
   ``Things were far worse in the days of the shah. Prison guards
used to beat us all the time. Now we're well-treated and there are
no beatings,'' he said, speaking in Farsi through an interpreter.

<HEAD>Strike Law Calls for Binding Arbitration</HEAD>
<UNK>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the government-controlled unions
presented a draft labor law to the legislature Wednesday, saying
Soviet workers should be allowed to strike if binding arbitration
fails, Tass reported.
   Stepan Shalayev presented the law just days before the Supreme
Soviet is to adjourn for the summer and a couple of weeks after
strikes by hundreds of thousands of miners paralyzed much of the
Soviet Union's coal industry.
   The Supreme Soviet debate over the proposed law so soon after
the strikes indicated that the government views labor unrest as a
potentially serious problem for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
his reform effort.
   But a leader of one Siberian coal strike committee said strikers
view Shalayev and other national union officials as ``just another
echelon of power,'' and that more strikes are likely unless the
Soviet Union's social and economic situation turns around.
   Soviet law in principle allows workers to strike but never has
addressed the issue explicitly. Workers are walking off their jobs
to protest low pay and bad working conditions as well as
unwillingness of the official union leadership to help.
   Tass said Shalayev told the Supreme Soviet the law calls for
establishing conciliation commissions to settle labor disputes and
gives either side the right to appeal to an arbitration commission
set up by a local court.
   It appeared from the Tass report that the law calls for
permitting strikes only when management fails to live up to an
agreement or arbitration order.
   The arbitration panel decision ``will be obligatory for
fulfillment,'' the official news agency said.
   ``If the conflicting parties still fail to settle their
differences, a labor collective will be given the right to use all
other methods envisaged by the law, including a strike,'' Tass
added. ``However, this can be done on the decision of the majority
of the labor collective.''
   The law also prohibits strikes that endanger people's lives, or
disrupt the normal life of the people or defense industries, Tass
said.
   It provided no details on what would be included in those
categories, but if interpreted broadly they could prohibit nearly
all strikes.
   Workers engaged in a legal strike will receive part of their
regular pay from management, Tass said.
   Shalayev acknowledged under questioning in the Supreme Soviet
that the draft law needs amendments. But the legislature endorsed
it in general and set it for publication in the official press. A
legislative debate will take place in the fall.
   Tass said many Supreme Soviet deputies spoke out for expanding
the right to strike and sharply defining those industries in which
strikes are not allowed.
   Emphasizing workers' suspicion of the official unions, one of
the coal strike leaders wrote in Wednesday's edition of the Moscow
News that the strikers regarded the unions as ``one more upper
echelon of power, from which we are given orders.''
   Teimuraz Avaliani, a member of the parliament and chairman of
the strike committee in the Kemerovo region of Siberia, said: ``We
need to create unions that are fundamentally new, maybe,
alternative unions.''
   ``It simply didn't enter our minds to invite Comrade Shalayev to
our side, and we presented him with demands similar to other
representatives of authority,'' Avaliani said.
   Avaliani said the strike was not an effort to take something
away from somebody else, but ``the action of people who live worse
than anyone else.''

<TEXT>
   An advertising agency Wednesday dumped hotel
queen Leona Helmsley's $5 million-a-year account and depicted
itself as the latest victim of her imperious attitude and penny
pinching.
   Mrs. Helmsley had a penchant for intruding in the ads and sealed
her fate with Taylor-Gordon, Aarons &amp; Co. Inc. when she imposed an
arbitrary 60 percent cut in agency fees for May and June, three
company executives said.
   ``I've been reading the papers. This is part of the pattern.
She's squeezed other contractors,'' said agency president Elaine
Taylor-Gordon. ``Eventually, no one escapes.''
   The company had handled the Helmsley account on a verbal
agreement for three years. Mrs. Helmsley was informed of the
decision in a letter sent to her home.
   The harsh words were the latest directed at Mrs. Helmsley, who
was in federal court Wednesday for her tax evasion trial. Witnesses
have detailed her abrasiveness and hair-trigger temper. Mayor
Edward I. Koch called her ``the wicked witch.''
   Ms. Taylor-Gordon, who said her company stands to lose $500,000
a year from its decision, pulled no punches herself.
   ``All of us knew she was queen and we were there to serve her,''
she said. ``It was evident in her body language, her imperiousness
and her arrogance.''
   She also described a typical business meeting with Mrs.
Helmsley: ``She was drinking martinis, and I was drinking Brioschi.
There was a lot of tension. ... She told me, `Don't get
comfortable. You're not here for a social event.'''
   Mrs. Helmsley, approached by reporters at the courthouse about
the agency's decision, said nothing and zipped shut her lips.
   Taylor-Gordon, Aarons was not the first agency to use Mrs.
Helmsley in ads for the hotel chain, or to dub her the ``queen'' _
her nickname among agency employees. In fact, she plays a smaller
role in the agency's ads, which emphasize the luxury of the
accommodations.
   Still, the tag line remains: the Helmsley Palace, the ads say,
is the only palace where the queen stands guard. And the ads
worked: Occupancy jumped from 24 percent before the ads to 87
percent after.
   Nevertheless, the ads were recently critiqued in Adweek magazine
as ranking ``among the worst advertising of our time ... terrible,
conceptually unoriginal, poorly written, badly art-directed and
photographically ugly.''
   Agency officials said Mrs. Helmsley was deeply involved in their
ad campaigns.
   ``She'd say, `I don't like the way that lapel looks. I don't
like the way that button looks.' And it wasn't a question,'' said
Larry Aarons, the agency's creative director. ``It was `Move that
button. Lift that bale. Tote that barge.'''
   Ms. Taylor-Gordon cited a recent New York state advertising
awards competition in which the Helmsley ads were nominated.
   ``There was such an uproar from certain judges that it was
decided not to consider us for the award,'' she said. ``It was the
client, not the ads.''
   But Ms. Taylor-Gordon predicted Mrs. Helmsley would have no
trouble finding another ad agency. ``And we'll send them all our
Maalox, Advil and extra suits of armor.''

<HEAD>Homeless Looking Out for Themselves as Spiked Wine Threat Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeless people have formed a
``neighborhood watch'' to protect themselves from the threat posed
by wine bottles spiked with glass shards that someone has been
leaving around town.
   Thirty-two spiked bottles have been found in the last month at
various places where the homeless are known to go. No one has been
hurt, police said Wednesday.
   ``People in suburban neighborhoods have these neighborhood
watches because they're worried about crime. ... Well, homeless
people are victims of crimes too,'' John Hatfield, who camps near
downtown, said. ``Somebody may take a belt of this wine and get
hurt real bad. So some of us are walking the streets every night
and keeping our eyes open.''
   He said the homeless are not the only ones in danger. A group of
children recently found six bottles in a park. Some advocates for
the homeless contend that the police did not respond quickly enough.
   ``If this had been a case of adulterated food in grocery stores,
you would have had a serious response immediately,'' said Jane
Haggstrom, coordinator for the Santa Barbara Homeless Coalition.
   Police say they are aggressively investigating and have assigned
a detective to the case full-time. Although police did not begin
posting flyers warning the homeless until July 20, the department
issued a press release July 1, after the first bottle was found.
   ``We're finding these bottles in a relatively large geographical
area, so it's not an easy case,'' Sgt. Richard Glaus said. ``And
it's not like food tampering inside a store where you can track
down manufacturing and distribution methods. With the wine bottles,

<HEAD>GOP Nominee Wins Landslide; Tense Democrats In Runoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican Party leaders rallied Wednesday around
their landslide nominee to succeed the late U.S. Rep. Claude
Pepper, while two Democrats began a tense runoff campaign.
   The winner in the GOP primary Tuesday, state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, was born in Cuba, a significant factor in a city
where politics, often is influenced by tensions among whites,
blacks and mostly Cuban-born Hispanics.
   Many look to the special vote to fill the 18th District seat as
a chance to elect the first Cuban-born member of Congress.
   On the Democratic side, attorney Gerald Richman claimed he had
momentum and his opponent, former Miami City Commissioner Rosario
Kennedy, was suffering backlash from negative campaigning as they
headed to an Aug. 15 runoff.
   Richman finished 146 votes ahead of Ms. Kennedy in Tuesday's
primary, with Pepper's niece, Jo Ann Pepper, third in the
seven-candidate field.
   Ms. Kennedy's supporters said nominating another Cuban-born
woman to oppose Ms. Ros-Lehtinen would negate ethnic factors. But
Richman called the 18th District ``an American seat'' and said he
could unite the multi-ethnic community.
   Pepper, a liberal champion of the elderly and poor who held the
seat for the Democrats since 1962, died May 30 at age 88.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who won the GOP nomination with 83 percent of
the vote, welcomed Republican Party help campaigning for the Aug.
29 special election. Vice President Dan Quayle headlined a luncheon
Wednesday to benefit her and other state Republican candidates.
Republicans are hoping to add to their unprecedented 10-8 majority
in Florida's congressional delegation.
   ``We're going to go all out,'' said state Republican Party
Chairman Van Poole. ``We have the better candidate and we're
unified.''
   Jeb Bush, the president's son, was at her victory party Tuesday
night, and U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., telephoned
congratulations.
   ``I'm particularly grateful that the primary campaign was one
that did not open wounds among Republicans,'' said Guy Vander Jagt,
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
   ``I think the bloody fight is going to be between the Democrats.
We're sailing on,'' said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a 37-year-old educator
with seven years in Florida's Legislature. She's married to U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   Richman, 48, and Ms. Kennedy, 44, were already arguing early
Wednesday over whose campaign was ethnically divisive.
   Richman took Ms. Kennedy to task for agreeing with Republican
National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater's remark that it was time
to elect a Cuban-American to Congress.
   Ms. Kennedy said Richman was taking her remark _ she said ``I am
that Cuban-American'' _ out of context.
   ``He (Richman) was there when I said it,'' she said. ``I meant
it as Republican vs. Democrat. I am a Cuban-American. I'm also a
woman. And I have represented all of the people of the City of
Miami.''
   Richman was angered by late Kennedy mailings that attacked him
for representing an international arms dealer, Sarkis Soghanalian,
who was charged with illegally conspiring to smuggle combat
helicopters to Iraq. Richman called Soghanalian a patriot who
helped U.S. causes.
   ``There has been some nasty negative campaigning that had me
extremely upset,'' Richman said.
   Ms. Pepper, also attacked in Kennedy campaign mailings, hadn't
announced a decision Wednesday on whether she would back Richman.
   In unofficial returns from all 146 precincts, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen
had 83 percent of the Republican vote; fellow Cuban-American Carlos
Perez, 57, had 11 percent; insurance broker David Fleischer, 54,
had 3 percent, and evangelist John Stembridge, 51, had 3 percent.
   For the Democrats, Richman had 28 percent of the vote, Ms.
Kennedy had 27 percent, and Ms. Pepper, 39, had 24 percent.
   Far out of the running were professor Marvin Dunn, 48, and real
estate agent Sonny Wright, 54, and businessman Bernard Anscher, 67,
and striking Eastern Airlines pilot John Paul Rosser.

   When Gov. Henry Bellmon praised Oklahoma's
law enforcement officers during an address to the national
Fraternal Order of Police convention, he spoke from firsthand
experience.
   While welcoming the estimated 3,500 out-of-town officers
Tuesday, Bellmon disclosed that he had been pulled over about 12:30
a.m. Sunday near his Billings farm.
   The governor said a deputy approached his vehicle and shined a
flashlight into the pickup.
   ``Even when he saw who I was, he asked me what I was doing out
so late at night,'' Bellmon said. ``I told him I had been working
late, but nevertheless, he took his flashlight and checked out the
back of the pickup.
   ``That says something about the vigilence of lawmen here in
Oklahoma,'' the governor said. ``It also says something about the
reputation of politicians in Oklahoma.''

   An elderly couple came to the rescue of
a man who lost 40 tickets to the Rolling Stones concert in
Pittsburgh.
   Michael Goss of Parsons said he and four friends went to
Washington, Pa., on July 22 and waited for more than two hours
before they plunked down $1,200 for tickets to the Sept. 6 concert.
   On the way home, Goss said he fell asleep. When he woke up, he
found that his companions had put makeup on him and painted his
fingernails as a practical joke. They carried it a step further by
stopping at a Morgantown supermarket and making Goss walk down the
aisles.
   The tickets apparently fell to the ground when he left the car,
Goss said.
   ``I felt real mad, real aggravated because I knew it was all
because of a practical joke,'' Goss said.
   In response to a classified advertisement he placed in the
Morgantown Dominion Post, an elderly couple returned the tickets on
Sunday. They refused to tell their names, but accepted a reward.
Given a choice of four tickets or $200, they chose the money.

   It's not easy getting into the Guinness
Book of World Records, a University of Connecticut fraternity found
out.
   Sigma Alpha Epsilon members hoped the 350-gallon milkshake they
whipped up in February would earn them a spot in the record book's
next edition. Instead, a 1,500-gallon chocolate milkshake made by
the WEZN radio station of Bridgeport the previous fall at a
festival in New Haven took the record.
   ``Well, it looks as though we're not going to try and beat that
record this fall at UConn,'' said fraternity President Eric
Dannheim. He said the fraternity made a crack at the record when it
found out in February that the Guinness editors had not made a
decision on the WEZN entry.
   ``We had decided before we began, whether it was a Guinness Book
record or not, we were going to do it,'' Dannheim said. ``We had a
lot of fun doing it.''
   The radio station's giant milkshake was mixed at a
Baskin-Robbins plant for the annual ``Taste of New Haven''
festival. The mixture was then pumped into a dairy truck, station
spokeswoman Patty LaVigne said.
   Cyd Smith, a Guinness editor, said some editors at the record
book had a problem with the mixing method, which delayed a final
decision.
   ``It will just become a competition of who has the bigger
truck,'' said Smith. ``One thousand, five hundred gallons is it.
It's enough.''
   A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at Dartmouth College in Hanover,
N.H., also was planning to go for the record, and was disappointed
to learn of the New Haven entry.
   ``When we found out, we were back to the same old routine,''
said Thomas Repczynski, the chapter's treasurer. ``We'll be
relegated to chugging goldfish again.''

   Iraq on Wednesday called for an emergency
Arab summit to find a solution to Lebanon's war after a committee
appointed to do so declared itself at an impasse.
   Eight people were wounded in the latest Syrian-Christian
fighting.
   Police said occasional bursts of machine-gun fire and mortar
explosions echoed on both sides of the Green Line, which divides
the capital into Moslem and Christian sectors.
   The skirmishes were much lighter than confrontations have been
in the past week and coincided with the Moslem new year, an
official holiday throughout Lebanon.
   Government offices, banks and other businesses closed in Moslem
and Christian sectors to mark the day, but there was little revelry.
   ``There is no celebration mood,'' said Sheik Rashid Anouti, a
Sunni Moslem clergyman. ``Beirut has been largely demolished and
hundreds of innocent people have been killed. Do you expect anyone
to celebrate anything?''
   According to police figures, 511 people have died and 2,170 have
been wounded in the latest round of fighting, which broke out March
8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian troops and
Syrian soldiers and their Moslem allies.
   Many city streets have been reduced to rubble, and hundreds of
thousands of residents have fled.
   A three-member Arab ministerial committee, trying more than two
months to solve Lebanon's crisis, said Tuesday it reached an
impasse and blamed Syria, which keeps about 40,000 troops in
Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   During an Arab League summit in May, King Hassan II of Morocco,
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Algerian President Chadli Benjedid
were asked to find a settlement by November to the war.
   At the summit, Syria blocked proposals to replace its troops
with a pan-Arab force.
   The leftist daily newspaper As-Safir, which is close to the
Syrian government of President Hafez Assad, described the
committee's report as ``very serious because it reflected a hostile
attitude toward Syria.''
   Farouq Abillama, an aide to Aoun, described the committee's
report as an ``indictment of the Syrian presence in Lebanon.''
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, has declared a ``war of liberation''
against Syria's troops in Lebanon. He said they undermined their
peacekeeping mandate by fighting on the Moslem side.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz told the official Iraqi News
Agency that an urgent session of the Arab summit was necessary to
solve the crisis.
   ``An emergency Arab summit bears the responsibility of dealing
with the situation in Lebanon and saving this Arab country from
occupation, terrorism, and blackmail,'' said Aziz, who is also
deputy prime minister.
   Syria is Iraq's main Arab foe and considers Lebanon within its
sphere of influence. It has refused to lift a blockade on Lebanon's
Christian enclave until it receives assurances Iraq has stopped
sending arms to Aoun's troops.
   Aziz called for a collective Arab stand against Syria and said
the Arabs should identify Syria as ``a major cause behind Lebanon's
civl war.'' He reiterated Iraq's demand for an immediate Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon.

   A federal jury today found Korean Air Lines
acted with willful misconduct when one of its planes flew off
course six years ago and was shot down by a Soviet war plane,
killing all 269 people aboard.
   The jury of three men and three women ruled that the actions by
KAL's crew were one of the causes of the shootdown of Flight 007 by
a Soviet fighter plane.
   Today's verdict permits the families of the dead passengers to
file individual suits seeking damages in excess of a
$75,000-per-passenger limit on compensation set under international
treaty.
   After the ruling read in court by U.S. District Judge Aubrey
Robinson, the jury began deliberating the question of whether the
families are entitled to punitive damages as well and if so, in
what amount.
   In final arguments Tuesday after a two-week trial in U.S.
District Court, lawyers for families of the victims said Flight 007
was off course almost from the minute it left the ground in
Anchorage, Alaska, and headed to its Pacific Ocean route for Seoul,
South Korea.
   Two pilots, testifying as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs,
theorized that the crew misprogrammed at least one and possibly all
three on-board computerized navigation systems while the Boeing 747
was in Anchorage.
   KAL lawyer George Tompkins said the main evidence in the case
was a line drawn by Soviet officials on a map showing an off-course
Flight 007 flying for several hours over Russian airspace hundreds
of miles to the west of its planned route.
   ``That Russian line ... was furnished by the people who shot
this plane down and killed these people,'' Tompkins said. ``This
disaster ... is going to remain a mystery until the Russians come
forward and say what evidence they have to support that black
line.''
   Tompkins said that to suggest the plane was off course for four
hours means that the crew radioed in false position reports at
three checkpoints in the Pacific Ocean.
   Lawyers for the families sought to prove that crew members had
to have known they were off course, yet decided to continue the
flight rather than return to Anchorage, where they would have faced
disciplinary action.
   The jury's verdict ``was in accord with all the evidence,'' said
Donald Madole, a lawyer for the families. ``When this plane was
flown off course into the danger area ... it was in fact willful
misconduct.''
   Tompkins said the company will appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.C.
   ``I think as a matter of law willful misconduct was not shown by
the evidence,'' said Tompkins.
   A defense motion to set aside the case is pending before the
judge.

   Leaders of Southeast Asia and
local royalty welcomed the 15-year-old future ruler of this tiny
oil-rich nation into the adult world Wednesday by sprinkling
scented water on his hands.
   Cannons fired in salute and thousands of Bruneians watched on TV
to watch the ritual for Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, the son of
Sultan Hassanal Bolkia.
   Leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand, as well as 3,000 other VIPs, including members of the
royal family, government dignitaries and foreign diplomats, were
invited to the two-hour ceremony in the throne hall of the sultan's
1,778-room palace.
   The pomp and pageantry, a combination of Islamic ritual and
Malay culture, were actually a commemoration of Prince Billah's
circumcision, a momentous event in the life of Malay Moslems.
   Even though the prince, eldest son of the 43-year-old sultan,
was circumcised a few years ago, the ceremonies were dubbed
``berkhatan'' _ Malay for circumcision.
   ``Coming of age is a more appropriate term,'' an official said,
but tradition dictates that such ceremonies be called berkhatan.
   A weeklong festival for the occasion began Sunday with the
beating of gongs and playing of pipes and other ethnic musical
instruments at the main gate to the 300-acre palace grounds.
   The streets of the capital were decorated with multicolored
lights and yellow Bruneian flags fluttering from the top of
virtually every building.
   Until Wednesday, however, the ceremonies had consisted of solemn
prayers, chants of religious hymns and nightly poetry readings at
the palace.
   A few hours before Wednesday's rites, the sultan, cited by the
Guinness Book of World Records as the world's wealthiest man, threw
an elaborate dinner at the cavernous royal banquet hall, whose
arches are covered with 22-carat gold tiles.
   His guest list was headed by President Suharto of Indonesia,
President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines and Prime Ministers Lee
Kuan Yew of Singapore, Chatichai Choonhavan of Thailand and
Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia.
   In declaring the sultan the world's richest individual, Guinness
said that as its absolute ruler, he has Brunei's oil income and
foreign exchange reserves of about $30 billion ``effectively at his
disposal.''
   After all guests were seated, about 100 men and boys marched up
the middle of the hall, bearing Prince Billah's regalia. They
included spears, swords, shields, rifles, pennants, candles, drums,
brass vases and urns.
   Behind them walked the young prince, in a green costume gleaming
with gold embroidery. Light from 12 giant chandeliers _ each with
600 bulbs _ reflected off the gems on his headdress.
   The normally shy boy appeared nervous. Just before Moslem
priests began chanting praise to Allah, Prince Billah rose from his
cushioned throne-like chair, set under a gold-colored canopy.
Apparently realizing the miscue, he quickly sat back, his head
bowed slightly.
   As the chanting began, the boy's parents, the leaders and other
guests came forward one by one and sprinkled scented water on his
hands, resting on a cushion on his lap. Outside, cannons boomed.
   Prince Billah is the third of the sultan's six children by Queen
Saleha, his first wife, but the elder of two boys. The sultan has a
son and two daughters by his second wife, Queen Mariam.
   On Thursday, the prince will undergo a cleansing ceremony in the
privacy of his apartments. Officials say the equivalent of this
rite for commoners is a swim in a river.
   After that, 25,000 children and other residents are expected to
line the streets of Bandar Seri Begawan to cheer Prince Billah as
he rides past on a float.
   Ceremonies at the palace are to continue through Sunday.

<HEAD>Drugs Promising For Transplanted Organs, Says Researcher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An experimental drug that stimulates rather
than suppresses the immune system offers new hope in preventing
rejection of transplanted human organs, a researcher says.
   ``The central dogma has been that if you stimulate the immune
system, that's bad,'' Dr. Randall Morris, director of the
Laboratory for Transplantation Immunology at Stanford University,
said in a telephone interview. ``We're developing a new dogma that
says it's possible to use the immune system as an ally.''
   Results of his research, which includes successful testing in
rodents, were delivered Wednesday to delegates to the triennial
International Congress on Immunology in West Berlin.
   Morris is testing lectins, proteins derived from plant tissue.
He said lectins promote the growth of certain white blood cells
called T-supressors. While the action of the T-supressors is not
clear, they apparently restrain another type of white blood cell,
T-killers, that attack foreign tissue, including transplanted
organs.
   In experiments at Stanford, transplanted hearts in rats remained
free of rejection for more than two years with no side effects. The
rats received 50 days of lectin treatment, Morris said in the
telephone interview, before his West Berlin speech.
   Tests on humans are still years away, he said.
   Morris said the lectins and two other experimental drugs will
require extensive further testing, but may someday reduce the need
for large doses of cyclosporine, a potent drug now used to prevent
transplant rejection by depressing the immune system.
   ``If our initial hopes are proven, we are nearing a fundamental
turning point in being able to keep transplant patients healthier
and alive longer,'' he said.
   Since human organ transplants began with kidneys about 35 years
ago, doctors have been unable to prevent the rejection of
transplanted organs without compromising the immune system.
   Cyclosporine, derived from a soil fungus, helps prevent
rejection by restraining the formation of white blood cells that
attack transplanted organs. But the daily oral doses can lead to
kidney failure and high blood pressure.
   Two other transplant experts _ Dr. Thomas Starzl at the
University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Robert Corry, chairman of surgery
at the University of Iowa and president of the United Network for
Organ Sharing _ said the use of lectins is virtually untested
elsewhere.
   Starzl said Morris' idea of boosting the immune system to
prevent organ rejection is a departure from current thinking on the
problem.
   Morris said tests at Stanford found lectins and two other drugs,
FK-506 and RPM, were effective in preventing rejection of
transplanted hearts in rodents.
   Like cyclosporine, he said, FK-506 and RPM are derived from
fungus and work by depressing the immune system, but they are more
powerful.
   FK-506, developed several years ago by a Japanese company, was
nearly 20 times more potent than cyclosporine in rodent testing,
Morris said.
   Heart transplants in rats treated for two weeks with FK-506
survived eight times longer, some longer than a year, than
recipients treated with cyclosporine, even though the FK-506 dose
was only one-fifth that of cyclosporine, Morris said.
   Starzl said his testing of FK-506 indicated that while it may be
powerful, it was too early to predict its potential.
   Corry said the hope is that FK-506 would be less toxic but more
effective than cyclosporin.

<HEAD>Truckers Say Refrigerated Food Trucks Also Carry Garbage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Truckers testifying behind a screen to conceal
their identities told a House panel Wednesday that they carried
garbage in the same refrigerated trucks used for food hauls, a
legal practice a lawmaker called ``more than disgusting.''
   ``Would you serve potato salad from your cat's litter box?''
Penn State University food science professor Manfred Kroger
rhetorically asked a House Public Works and Transportation
subcommittee during an all-day hearing.
   The investigations subcommittee released correspondence showing
that Campbell Soup Co., Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co., Michigan Sugar Co.,
and other food manufacturers had taken steps in the last two months
to ensure that their products were not placed in the same trailers
that hauled waste to landfills.
   None of the food firms said it knew of such a practice, but all
said they wanted to safeguard against it.
   The Food and Drug Administration said an investigation had found
no contaminated food.
   The vice president and driver for a small, family-owned trucking
firm specializing in hauling meat products from the Midwest to the
East told the subcommittee food-garbage hauling appeared widespread.
   ``Of the ten largest carriers in my area that haul refrigerated
food products to the East Coast, six of them I know have loaded it
(garbage),'' he said.
   A woman trucker told the panel her firm hauled two loads of
garbage on return trips by food trucks to the Midwest. She said she
refused other loads because ``I just didn't want to put it in the
trucks.''
   Both truckers who testified were hidden by a partition on three
sides because they did not want their identities made public,
according to the committee, which also would not divulge their home
states.
   Part of the problem is that trucks making trips East cannot
afford to return to the Midwest empty, the male trucker said. He
said garbage is ``a dream commodity'' to return home with because
``you're not responsible for anything. How could you destroy it?''
   Still, he said he felt there could be sanitary problems, even
though his trucks are steam-cleaned. ``I'm not a bacteriologist,''
he said.
   He said his meat-hauling trucks used to carry bales of waste to
a landfill near Youngstown, Ohio, but stopped in June at the
request of customers.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission in an inquiry last month
confirmed the practice of food trucks carrying garbage, according
to testimony.
   In one instance, a food truck emptied at an Ohio landfill
``emanated powerful garbage odors'' despite just being washed, said
Bernard Gaillard, director of the ICC's Office of Compliance and
Consumer Assistance.
   Before the garbage haul, the truck had carried avocadoes from
California to New York City, Gaillard said.
   Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., organized the hearing after a
Centre Daily Times newspaper reporter in his district observed
trailers and refrigerator trucks in May either carrying or being
loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station, and being
unloaded at an Ohio landfill.
   ``The idea of garbage being hauled in food trucks seems more
than disgusting,'' Clinger said Wednesday. ``It seems dangerous.''
He said a new law was needed because existing regulations are
ambiguous.
   The American Trucking Association, a trade group, said in a
written statement that, ``It would seem appropriate to ATA to
require that trailers be properly cleaned _ by steam or other
effective process _ before they leave a landfill site.''
   Refrigerator trailers, with their ribbed, stainless-steel
floors, normally carry meat, poultry, dairy products, fresh fruits
and vegetables to market.
   Penn State's Kroger said there were chemical and microbiological
arguments against food-garbage hauling.
   ``Food trucks that back up into filthy dump sites presumably can
easily be infected all over and later spread disease-causing
bacteria into the truck bodies and into food factories during
loading,'' he said.

73-year-old American nun who was seriously wounded when she was
shot in the head during an apparent robbery attempt in El Salvador
six weeks ago.
   Sister Mary Stanislaus Mackey, a member of the Sisters of
Charity of the Incarnate Word, will be moved to a Houston convent
this week to continue her recuperation, doctors at Houston's St.
Joseph Hospital said Tuesday.
   ``I think the outcome approaches miracle stage when one
considers she was shot in the head at close range with a
large-caliber handgun,'' Rob Parrish, the nun's neurosurgeon, said.
   `Sister Stan,' as she is called, was hit by a .38-caliber bullet
June 21 as she and two other nuns rode in a pickup truck in
Zaragoza, El Salvador. The sisters are unsure of the motive for the
attack, but speculate the gunman, one of several men in a pickup
truck, wanted to rob the nuns, who had just been to a bank.
   Sister Mackey worked in the town 10 miles south of San Salvador
in an orphanage for children whose parents have been killed in the
nine-year civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government.
   The bullet shattered her cheekbone. After initial treatment in
San Salvador, she was flown to Houston, where her religious order
is based.
   Doctors operated June 26 to remove a bullet fragment lodged in
her brain and to relieve swelling in her brain. A second operation
was performed July 8 to reattach the retina in her left eye.
   ``There appears to have been some damage to her optic nerve and
we're not sure how much sight she will recover in her left eye,''
Dr. James Baker said.
   Sister Mackey, accompanied by a nurse and using a cane for
support, read a brief prepared statement at a news conference
Tuesday but declined to take questions.
   ``I want to thank everyone for their interest and their
prayers,'' she said. ``God has taken me completely into His hands,
and I thank everybody who has played a part in my recovery. I
especially appreciate the good work of my doctors, the nurses,
priests, bishops and the sisters of the congregation.''
   Baker said he anticipated no long-term problems with motor
functions although she had some problems with short-term memory.
   Five or six men accused of the shooting were taken into custody
within the past week, said Sister Ann Mary Brangan, one of the
other nuns in the pickup truck, but she has been unable to identify
them for police.
   Sister Mackey, a registered nurse, had worked in Central America
since 1963 and in El Salvador since 1983.

<HEAD>Dryness in Some Regions Continues Pattern of the Decade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may surprise some soggy Easterners, but
drought _ the big 1988 weather story now getting little national
attention _ is still a hot item in parts of America.
   True, the East and South which baked a year ago are now stuck in
a summer of excessive wetness. But the Southwest, relatively moist
in the summer of 1988, is parched this year.
   And parts of the Corn Belt in the nation's middle, as well as
sections of California, have been dry in both summers.
   The Western and Midwestern dryness this summer continues a
pattern of the decade, which have seen serious regional drought
somewhere in the United States every year except 1982.
   More than half of the nation is undergoing either severely dry
or excessively wet conditions, an indication that the upper air
flow patterns are allowing conditions to remain in place for long
periods, federal climate researchers report.
   The 30-day outlook for August contains some hope for the
Southwest, although the heavier than normal rainfall expected this
month isn't likely to continue over the upcoming 90 days, the
federal Climate Analysis Center reports.
   As for California, dryer than normal conditions are forecast in
August with the outlook mixed over the three-month span.
   Even so it isn't as bad as last summer, one of the driest years
overall in this century.
   In June, for example, the U.S. Geological Survey found 27
percent of the nation's streams and rivers running below normal. In
June 1988, some 60 percent of rivers and streams were below normal.
   A compromise disaster-relief proposal seems near in the Senate
as members of Congress seek to help farmers cope with the
crop-wilting weather in some areas and drowned fields in other
regions.
   From May 1 to mid-July less than half of the normal rain fell in
Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Texas, California, Colorado,
Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska,
Wisconsin, Illinois and along the eastern edge of Florida.
   The excessive heat and dryness in the West has contributed to
the extreme fire danger in many areas, with dangerous blazes raging
in Idaho, Oregon, California and other regions.
   In the Midwestern farm belt, crops are suffering not only by
lack of rain this year but with lack of soil moisture due to last
year's drought. Corn, soybean and grain crops are affected, among
others.
   Some recent rains have helped the topsoil, but so far have been
too light to improve moisture conditions below the surface.
   ``Since May 1, below normal rainfall has persisted from southern
California northeastward to the upper Plains and Illinois. In
extreme southern Minnesota, eastern Iowa and western Illinois,
deficits exceed 10 inches,'' the Climate Analysis Center reports.
   June, normally the wettest month in the Midwest, saw only 60
percent of normal rainfall in parts of Illinois, Minnesota and Iowa.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has had to release impounded water
to maintain navigation on parts of the Missouri River, and sections
of the Mississippi are carrying only about one-third of the usual
flow for this time of year.
   Meantime, the Southeast was drenched with rains spawned by
tropical storm Allison in late June and early July, the wetness
extending as far as the Middle Atlantic states.

<HEAD>Official: Communists Could Enact Own Multiparty Law Without Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior communist official indicated
Wednesday that his party could enact its own legislation on
political reform if talks founder with the opposition, but a
communist negotiator urged patience.
   The comment by Deputy Justice Minister Geza Kilenyi came hours
after members of the opposition accused the ruling communists of
dragging their feet in negotiations that broke down last week.
   The negotiations broke down over the wording of a new
constitution, a new party law, party finances and the office of a
new president with wide powers. The first multiparty elections in
Hungary since the 1948 communist takeover are slated to be held
next year.
   Kilenyi indicated legislative measures already drawn up by the
communists, but tabled for review in talks with the opposition,
could be considered in Parliament without discussion if the
negotiations remain inconclusive.
   ``If there is no suitable progress made, we will simply take
those items of draft legislation and put them back on the table
again in Parliament,'' he said.
   Kilenyi criticized the Opposition Round Table, which includes
nine opposition groups, for what he called their inflexibility.
   But Central Committee secretary Gyerogy Fejti, a leading
communist negotiator, said he still seeks an agreement.
   ``It does not help the achievement of a compromise if differing
views are made public too early,'' Fejti said. ``Compromise
requires an atmosphere of patience and calm.''
   Imre Pozsgay, a top reformer on the Executive Political
Committee (Politburo), has promised an agreement regardless of how
long it takes.
   At an earlier news conference, Janos Kis of the League of Free
Democrats alleged the Hungarian Socialist Workers (Communist) Party
``is trying to suggest to the nation that the choice is between
that party and chaos.''
   Peter Toelgyessy of the League of Free Democrats said the
communists want to retain in the constitution the paragraph on the
working class as the leading social force in the nation ``and other
such holdovers from the present constitution based on the Stalinist
model.''
   He said the communists want ``to use the constitutional state as
a smokescreen and continue business as usual under the same
management.''
   The opposition groups disagree on the need to have a law on
parties, contending that the existing law on association is
sufficient and only a law on party financing and operation is
needed.
   A major obstacle in the talks is whether the wealth of the
communist party should be distributed to other groups.
   On July 27, the communists, who had been amenable to discussing
the issue, reversed their position. They said the party acquired
its assets legally and that distribution of the money is an
internal party affair.
   On Wednesday, Fejti sidestepped a question on his party's
financial holdings.
   There is also disagreement on who may field candidates in first
multi-party elections next year and how many signatures will be
required to get on the ballot and where and how such signatures may
be collected.

   Orders for manufactured goods edged up a
slight 0.4 percent in June, reflecting a rebound in demand for
military hardware, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods
totaled a seasonally adjusted $234.6 billion in June following a
sharp 2.6 percent plunge in May.
   Many analysts said they were unimpressed by the slight rebound
in June, pointing out that the big drop in May was the third
setback so far this year. They also noted a report Tuesday that the
Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of economic
conditions, fell in July to its lowest point in 6{ years.
   ``The industrial sector is losing ground,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, senior economist at the New York brokerage firm of
Merrill Lynch. ``We are seeing a mild recession developing in the
United States right now.''
   Steinberg predicted that the economy would contract in both the
current quarter and in the fourth quarter of this year before
beginning to recover in early 1990.
   However, other economists were not as pessimistic, noting that
the housing industry, which had been in a slump earlier this year,
is beginning to rebound. Another government report Wednesday showed
that new homes sales climbed 5.5 percent in June, the third monthly
increase.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said the
pickup in housing should spill over into manufacturing, helping to
bolster sales of home appliances and building materials.
   Ms. Latta and other economists said one reason they believed the
country would be able to escape a recession is that unsold
inventories have not built up to such high levels that they would
trigger sharp cutbacks in production over the months ahead.
   Those economists also noted that the backlog of unfilled orders,
considered a good indicator of whether production cutbacks will be
needed, continued to rise in June, climbing by 0.5 percent to
$490.3 billion. The orders backlog has not declined since February
1987.
   In June, new orders for durable goods, items expected to last
three or more years, rose 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$124.2 billion. This represented a slight upward revision from an
advance report a week ago that put the increase at 0.3 percent.
   Orders for nondurable goods rose 0.4 percent as well, with
various consumer categories showing strength.
   Much of June's overall advance came from an 18.3 percent surge
in orders for military equipment, a rebound from an 11.4 percent
drop in this volatile category in May.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods edged up
0.3 percent in June following a 7.7 percent decline in May. This
category is closely watched for signs of industry plans to expand
and modernize.
   Many economists said they believed that business investment,
which has been strong over the past year, will weaken in the last
half of 1989. But the Bush administration is counting on continued
strength in investment to support its optimistic forecast that the
overall economy will grow by 2.9 percent, as measured by the gross
national product.
   Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.5 percent in June to
$231.9 billion. The trend in shipments has been flat this year,
averaging $231.2 billion, about 1.5 percent less than orders each
month.

<HEAD>Landlord Sold Sculptures for Scrap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DERBY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven metal sculptures, representing one
year's labor by artist Denis O'Connor, were sold as scrap for $16
by his landlord while he was on vacation, the artist told a civil
court hearing Wednesday.
   Vivian Lovell, a Public Arts Commission official, said he valued
the works at up to $10,400. They included images of a bird and a
train.
   Landlord Peter Ward, who said he thought the sculptures were
junk, was ordered by Derby County Court to pay O'Connor $6,900
damages and interest plus legal costs. The court found he had
unfairly evicted the sculptor from his studio.
   O'Connor, also a college lecturer, has sold more than 400 works.

<HEAD>6th Fleet Flagship Cancels Soviet Port Call</HEAD>

   The flagship of the U.S. 6th Fleet canceled a
ceremonial visit to a Soviet port, and it and other warships were
put ``at the beck and call'' of President Bush on Wednesday in case
they're needed in the hostage situation, Pentagon officials said.
   The aircraft carrier USS America and eight escort ships also cut
short a port call in Singapore, other officials said, but the
Pentagon refused to reveal the carrier's destination or the reason
for the battle group's early departure.
   Military officials, speaking privately, emphasized that the ship
movements were not ``bellicose'' actions and noted that the forces
in the Mediterranean area remain at the normal peace-time level.
   But the announcements highlighted the type of ``show-the-flag''
movements designed to give the impression that U.S. forces are
ready to act if the president decides to use them.
   ``We're positioning ourselves at the beck and call of the
president,'' said one Pentagon official familiar with the tactics.
``These are not necessarily bellicose moves _ but we want to be
ready in case we are needed. ... These are prudent measures,'' the
official said.
   The Pentagon official stressed that ``extensive on-scene
diplomatic efforts'' are under way, and that emphasis is not being
placed on a possible military strike.
   ``We are just giving the president what he might need,'' the
official said.
   But, the official also pointed out, in case a strike is ordered,
U.S. ships are ready with their long-range guns, aircraft and
missiles, even if they remain some distance from a possible target.
   ``You don't have to be near the shore to do what may be
necessary,'' the official said.
   In a statement, the Pentagon announced that the USS Belknap, the
Navy flagship in the Mediterranean, canceled a four-day call at the
port of Sevastapol.
   Two other ships, the USS Thomas S. Gates and the USS Kauffman,
were slated to keep to the scheduled visit, set for Aug. 4-8.
   The Belknap, a guided missile cruiser with fleet commander Vice
Adm. James D. Williams aboard, had been scheduled to call at the
Black Sea port as part of a long-planned exchange worked out
between the superpowers.
   Three Soviet ships just departed Norfolk, Va., after conducting
the first such visit to a U.S. port in 14 years.
   Williams and his ship ``are required elsewhere and will not be
able to visit Sevastopol,'' the Pentagon statement said.
   The statement made no mention of the reported execution of Lt.
Col. William Higgins, or of threats by Shiite Moslem factions to
execute another U.S. hostage.
   The cancellation of the Belknap's visit allows Williams to
remain in the Mediterranean in case his services are needed there,
said other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Tuesday, the only U.S. aircraft carrier in the 6th Fleet, the
USS Coral Sea, had left Alexandria, Egypt, ``several hours
earlier'' than planned, Navy sources said.
   The Pentagon, following normal policy, refused to divulge the
destination of any of the carriers or their battle groups.
   One official pointed out that if the America is headed in the
direction of the Middle East, it will take nearly a week for the
carrier to cross the Indian Ocean from Singapore.
   Overall, there are between 20 to 25 U.S. ships in the
Mediterranean at this time, with approximately 20 others in the
Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean region, Pentagon officials said.
   The battleship Iowa, which is not allowed to use its 16-inch
guns pending the outcome of a Navy inquiry into the April explosion
in one of its three turrets, ended its port call in Marseilles,
France, and is in the Mediterranean, the sources said.
   The ship has a variety of weapons, including cruise missiles,
that could be used if necessary, sources said.
   Also on permanent station in the Mediterranean is a three-ship
amphibious landing group composed of 2,400 Marines, officials said.
   ``This is very typical of the Mediterranean,'' said one Navy
official. ``There is nothing unique about our deployment there.
It's our normal peace-time position,'' he said.
   The official added that the Navy's duty is to provide a U.S.
presence around the world and the ship movements allow routine
patrols as well as for training.
   ``We have to train as if we were at war, and you can't do that
in port,'' he said.

   Although many Poles may find it unsavory
to have a policeman heading the government, the election Wednesday
of Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak as prime minister means very little change.
   Before the presidential election July 19, the three most
important officials were Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski and Kiszczak, the interior minister.
   On Wednesday, after the government and Communist Party moves
were completed, the three most important figures were Jaruzelski,
Rakowski and Kiszczak.
   Now they have different job titles and roles, but the same team
is in place for the Communist Party to continue its contradictory
policy of ``agreement and struggle'' with the reborn Solidarity
trade union movement.
   The party needs agreement with the opposition to cure Poland's
economic problems. But the party also needs to fight with the
opposition for the hearts and minds of at least a part of the
population.
   Jaruzelski, the author of the policy who has resigned as
Communist Party leader, assumed the newly strengthened office of
president with ultimate control of the military and foreign
relations. He is a guarantee to Poland's communist neighbors that
moves toward democracy demanded by Solidarity won't bring any
sudden change in the country's loyalty to the Soviet Union and
Warsaw Pact.
   He was Poland's top leader before, and he retains that power now.
   In addition, he has prolonged his time in power. Party rules
would have required him to step down as leader after the next party
congress in 1990. Now, he can hold the office of president at least
until 1995.
   Rakowski, whom Solidarity leaders would like to impeach for
alleged mismanagement of the economy during his nine months as
prime minister, moves over to Jaruzelski's old office at party
headquarters.
   A strong-willed player of political hardball, he riled the
opposition early in his administration with his decision to close
Solidarity's birthplace, the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk. He riled it
again at the end of his term with spectacular increases in food
prices.
   According to one Central Committee member quoted during the
party debate on Rakowski's candidacy, public confidence in the
government fell by half during his tenure.
   Now that Solidarity holds a good chunk of the National Assembly
_ control of the 100-member Senate and 35 percent of the Sejm _ the
prime minister by necessity must be able to work with the union.
Always more of a fighter than conciliator, Rakowski did not fit the
job description.
   In key ways, however, he does fit the needs of the party, its
self-confidence and fighting spirit deflated as the result of its
crushing losses to Solidarity in the June parliamentary elections.
Rakowski's most important trait is that he will get the party ``up
off its knees,'' a party spokesman said this week.
   Enter Kiszczak. As interior minister since 1981 in charge of an
army of uniformed and secret police, he knows the opposition better
than anyone else in government. His agents tapped their telephones
and collected their illegal publications.
   During two waves of strikes last year, Kiszczak opened channels
of communication to the opposition and called for the talks that
evolved into the historic ``round-table'' accords that legalized
Solidarity and led to the country's first democratic elections
since World War II.
   As head of the police, he had credibility with Solidarity as a
negotiating partner and did not risk appearing too soft to his
colleagues when he made concessions.
   In nominating Kiszczak to head the government after Rakowski,
Jaruzelski emphasized his proven ability at the round table to
reach agreements. Speaking of his relationship with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa last month, Kiszczak himself acknowledged the
same.
   ``We differ in many respects and yet, so far, we have always
managed to come to an agreement when matters of crucial agreement
were concerned,'' he said. ``And this is what counts most.''
   Although the job switches undoubtedly suit the current needs of
Jaruzelski and the Communist Party, they are bound to disappoint
many Poles who expected dramatic changes when they voted in 260 out
of 261 Solidarity candidates during the parliamentary elections.
   In the end, the same people will be in charge.
   ``What kind of new government is that supposed to be?'' said a
disgruntled lawmaker from the communist-allied Peasant Party.

<HEAD>HHS Head Says Methadone Programs Not Perfect, But Helpful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan told Congress
Wednesday that while methadone programs are ``not ideal,'' they are
better than doing nothing to help heroin addicts quit their habit
and avoid AIDS.
   Sullivan, testifying before the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, defended his department's proposal to
make methadone available to more addicts to prevent needle-sharing
and help curb the spread of AIDS.
   ``This is not ideal,'' he said in response to two studies
critical of the plan. ``But this, we feel, is better than nothing
for those individuals.''
   He emphasized that the program proposed in March would be an
``interim step'' that would allow heroin addicts to receive
methadone while they wait for an opening in a comprehensive
methadone treatment program.
   The General Accounting Office and Drug Enforcement
Administration, in separate studies presented to the committee,
questioned the wisdom of the Department of Health and Human
Services' plan. They cited continued drug abuse by many patients in
treatment and illegal diversion of the methadone.
   Under the HHS proposal, heroin addicts unable to get into a
comprehensive treatment program would be able to receive methadone
daily at outpatient clinics and from mobile medical units. The
synthetic narcotic would not be provided for take-home use and
addicts would be counseled on avoiding AIDS.
   Heroin addicts often share needles and, in doing so, can spread
or contract the AIDS virus. Methadone, which is used to help
relieve an addict's craving for heroin and is less addictive, is
taken by mouth, eliminating the risk from needles.
   About 100,000 people were undergoing methadone treatment last
year; the government estimates there are about 500,000 heroin
addicts nationwide.
   Preliminary results of the GAO study of 15 methadone programs in
five states indicate that as many as 47 percent of patients in
treatment for more than six months at one clinic continued to use
drugs. Forty percent of patients at another clinic used cocaine.
   ``Results of our work indicate that most clinics have not been
able to deal effectively with the drug problems of many of their
patients,'' Janet L. Shikles, director of national and public
health issues for the GAO, an arm of Congress, said in testimony
submitted to the panel.
   ``It is unclear how effective the interim maintenance program
would be in reducing the spread of AIDS,'' she said. ``GAO believes
that additional information is needed before the program is allowed
to be implemented nationwide.''
   The GAO reviewed methadone clinics serving more than 3,300
patients in New York, California, Washington, Florida and Texas.
Most clinic officials GAO investigators interviewed did not support
the HHS plan allowing interim methadone maintenance programs, she
said.
   Gene R. Haislip, deputy administrator of the DEA's Office of
Diversion Control, said an investigation conducted in the New York
metropolitan area between Aug. 21 and Sept. 16, 1988, found ``there
is significant selling of take-home dosages of methadone.''
   Haislip said many of the programs monitored by DEA have lax
safeguards and ``routinely ignore'' test results that show patients
are using other drugs rather than take taking their methadone.
   ``There is little incentive for individuals to become drug-free
because their steady supply of methadone provides them with a
constant source of illicit income with which to purchase other
drugs, primarily cocaine,'' he said.

   The communist-led coalition overcame
internal rifts Wednesday to elect Poland's interior minister, Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak, as prime minister, securing the Communist Party's
control of the government.
   Kiszczak said his first priority would be to provide food to the
nation, which was reeling from price increases of up to 300 percent
that took effect Tuesday. Many store shelves were empty because
consumers stocked up on supplies before the prices went up.
   Kiszczak has been head of the nation's powerful police force the
past eight years and was a leading enforcer of the 1981 martial-law
crackdown on the Solidarity trade union. Parliament elected him
237-173, with 10 abstentions. He needed 211 votes.
   The election completed a trio of changes in Poland's top
echelons, which leave the same personalities in power but with
different functions.
   Former party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was elected
president last month. Former Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski
succeeded him as party chief, and Kiszczak replaced Rakowski.
   The party kept the top political jobs despite a humiliating
defeat in June elections _ the country's most democratic in 40
years.
   ``A political monopoly of exercising power by one party must be
discarded and destroyed. It does not serve the country,''
Solidarity floor leader Bronislaw Geremek told Parliament before
the vote.
   ```We stand against this candidacy because no personnel
reshuffle within the present political arrangements, dictated by
the monopoly of a single party, can solve the country's problems.''
   Kiszczak must form a new government and work with Solidarity
lawmakers to rebuild the economy.
   ``The most urgent task today is the problem of feeding the
nation and filling empty shelves,'' Kiszczak said on the evening
news. ``As chief of the government, I will devote my whole effort
to that.''
   Kiszczak's candidacy appeared threatened Tuesday, when some
deputies of the Communist-allied Peasants Party threatened to
withdraw their support. Communist officials persuaded them to vote
for Kiszczak.
   The communist coalition holds a 299-161 majority in Parliament,
but the communists themselves hold only 173 seats. The Peasants and
Democratic Parties hold the rest in the coalition.
   Solidarity lawmakers went into caucus after the vote to see
which of their members had not cast ballots and possibly helped
Kiszczak. Many Solidarity deputies boycotted the presidential vote
rather than casting ``no'' votes, allowing Jaruzelzki to win by a
slim margin.
   In his acceptance speech, Kiszczak renewed a Communist Party
proposal to form a ``grand coalition'' in which Solidarity
lawmakers would be offered some ministries. The opposition has said
it will not join such a coalition.
   ``I will not give up efforts to attract ... the representatives
of the opposition circles with a hope that in the future a grand
coalition government will be possible,'' Kiszczak said.
   Communist leaders would like Solidarity to join the government
to share in difficult decisions that must be made to reform the
economy. But the party says it is not prepared to give the
opposition the prime minister's job or key ministries such as
defense and the interior.
   In a speech before the vote, Kiszczak called for ``drastic
measures'' to prevent economic destabilization. Among his proposals
were budget cuts, reevaluating investment policy and curbing some
exports, including cattle.
   Kiszczak said he hoped to form a government within two weeks. He
then must tackle the economy.
   The value of the zloty is plunging daily. Shoppers emptied store
shelves last week ahead of Tuesday's sharp price increases, and
discontented workers throughout the country are grumbling that the
time has come to strike.
   The price increases were part of a controversial
``marketization'' plan of Rakowski. Authorities said the increases
are needed to prompt farmers to deliver their meat and produce to
market and to stabilize the level of state subsidies to the food
industry.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Communist Party lost a key vote for the
first time in postwar Poland as Solidarity lawmakers pushed through
a resolution calling for an extraordinary investigation of the
activities of the Rakowski government.
   Solidarity believes the government should be held accountable
for the economic situation.
   The commission will decide if there are legal grounds to refer
alleged misconduct to the State Tribunal, which handles government
impeachments.
   The deputies voted 206-169 with 31 abstentions to create the
commission.
   Neither Jaruzelski nor Rakowski was present for the vote.
Officials Tuesday said Rakowski went to the hospital after a spell
of faintness in connection with a previously unpublicized heart and
blood pressure problem. A secretary in his office Wednesday said he
was feeling better and was no longer in the hospital.

   The international uproar over the reported
killing of Lt. Col. William Higgins, including criticism from
Iran's president-elect, left U.S. officials somewhat encouraged
Wednesday about the fate of the second American hostage facing a
death sentence in Lebanon.
   Two days after a militant Shiite group in Lebanon announced
Higgins' execution on Monday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said she was unable to think of a single country that
hasn't spoken out against the action.
   Still, other officials cautioned the situation remains grim,
pointing out the captors of Joseph Cicippio, who was taken hostage
in 1986, have not backed off their pledge to execute him on
Thursday.
   Ms. Tutwiler seemed to attach importance to a joint statement
issued Tuesday in Tehran by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and Iran's president-elect Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani in which they expressed regret over Higgin's reported
death.
   They also condemned ``all acts of a terrorist nature.''
   Ms. Tutwiler called on Rafsanjani to act ``in accordance with
the spirit'' of his statement.
   She said the United States ``remains convinced that Iran is in a
position to bring significant influence to bear'' on the
pro-Iranian groups who hold the American hostages and she called on
the Iranians to use the influence.
   If Higgins' death is confirmed, that would leave eight American
hostages in Lebanon. The State Department was still unable to
confirm absolutely that the body in the videotape released Monday
in Beirut was that of Higgins.
   Ms. Tutwiler also welcomed a statement by a top aide to
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat criticizing
the execution of Higgins.
   The sense among American officials was that the outrage
expressed by Western as well as Islamic countries about the
developments in Beirut may be having an impact on Iran and its
Shiite allies in Lebanon.
   The officials, asking not to be identified, left open the
possibility that the Iranians may have convinced the captors of
Cicippio, 58, to delay his execution by 48 hours.
   A crisis atmosphere had prevailed here when the group claiming
to hold Cicippio, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, said it
would kill him Tuesday at 11 a.m. EDT unless Israel freed a Shiite
Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli commandos July 28.
   With the delay in administering the death sentence, officials
expressed hope that intensified diplomatic efforts by U.S. envoys
may be bearing fruit. The U.S. diplomats have been in touch with a
number of countries with access to or influence with Iran.
   In Beirut, Shiite Moslem sources said Iranian pressure may have
been behind the decision to delay the execution and added the
chance his life may be spared has increased.

<HEAD>House Moves Toward Making Airline Smoking Ban Permanent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted tentatively on Wednesday to
make the smoking ban on most airline flights permanent, but decided
not to consider extending the prohibition to all routes.
   On a 259-169 vote, lawmakers adopted language that would make
permanent the current ban on smoking on flights of two hours or
less, which otherwise will expire next April. The ban covers 80
percent of domestic air traffic.
   But the provision, which was not actively opposed by the tobacco
industry, also forbade consideration of a proposal to extend the
ban to all domestic flights.
   The language became part of the $11.9 billion transportation
appropriations bill for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. The House
planned to complete work on the bill on Thursday and send it to the
Senate.
   Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of the smoking ban
proposal, cited surveys of airline passengers by health groups
showing an overwhelming number of them support the two-hour ban
Congress adopted in April 1988.
   ``I can't think of a thing we've done on the floor of the House
in the last two years that has been greeted as positively and
warmly by the American people,'' he told his colleagues.
   Durbin, who sponsored the 1988 law, wanted to offer an amendment
that would have banned smoking on all domestic flights. But he was
blocked by the rules of the House from offering it and was unable
to persuade the House to change the procedure.
   The smoking ban provision was backed by airline employee and
health organizations, which have argued that so-called secondary
smoke breathed by people sitting next to smokers can be dangerous.
   The tobacco and cigarette industries and their supporters in
Congress _ mostly from tobacco-growing states _ have argued that
definitive data on the dangers of smoking is lacking, and that a
prohibition hurts growers and manufacturers.
   However, lobbyists laid low during Wednesday's vote. They
conceded that anti-smoking sentiment in Congress had reached the
point where they were better off accepting a permanent ban on
two-hour flights and avoiding fights on broadening the prohibition
every time the law expires.
   ``We're not going to support this, but that doesn't mean we're
actively opposing it, either,'' Walker Merryman, vice president of
the Tobacco Institute, said before the vote.
   ``This is no worse than what we've been living with,'' said Rep.
Walter Jones, D-N.C., whose district is one of the biggest tobacco
producers in the country. ``We hope this is the last we'll hear of
this for the time being.''
   Technically, the House vote was on the procedure lawmakers will
follow when they debate the transportation spending bill on
Thursday, and other issues were involved. But floor debate over the
provision was dominated by the smoking ban question.

<HEAD>Florida Governor Gives Bush Anti-Drug Recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez brought President
Bush a thick packet of recommendations Wednesday from the National
Governors' Association on how to wage the war on drugs.
   Bush promised to forward the proposals swiftly to drug policy
chief William J. Bennett, who is due to unveil a new national
drug-fighting strategy next month.
   The governors' 10-point plan, approved at their summer meeting
in Chicago on Tuesday, endorsed Bush's call for a hemispheric drug
summit and urged that foreign aid be tied to countries' cooperating
with U.S. efforts to eradicate drugs.
   ``The loss of a generation of young people because of the abuse
of drugs ... is the most serious issue facing the nation,''
Martinez said after emerging from the Oval Office.
   Providing ``a larger carrot ... in foreign aid and perhaps a
better deal on the reduction of the world debt, I believe, is a
good way to go,'' said Martinez.
   He added that a new extradition treaty with Colombia with ``some
teeth'' is also needed.
   The governors also urged the Bush administration to convert idle
military bases into federal drug prisons.
   ``The land is there. The facilities are there. It's a question
many times of perimeter fences, so we're not talking big money on
most of these items that we are submitting to the White House,''
Martinez said.
   Bush ``did not indicate to me how close they were in developing
the policy,'' said Martinez.
   He said they also discussed the congressional primary results in
Miami, where state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen captured the GOP
nomination for the seat of the late Claude Pepper. The Democratic
race is headed for a Aug. 15 runoff, two weeks before the special
election.
   Martinez said he also informed Bush of the National Governors
Association vote Tuesday calling for a two-year moratorium on
expanding Medicaid.
   Martinez, who has called a special session of the Florida
legislature Oct. 10 to seek stricter limits on abortion, said he
and Bush did not discuss abortion.
   Florida lawmakers will be the first to tackle the issue since
the recent Supreme Court ruling giving states more authority to
restrict abortions.
   The governor said he was trying ``to balance the rights of women
and the unborn child.''
   Martinez said he favors changing state law to declare the fetus
viable at the 20th week instead of the 24th, to impose higher
medical standards for abortion clinics, and to require attending
physicians to counsel women about ``the health of the unborn baby''
before performing abortions.
   ``I cannot imagine anyone who would like to see an unborn baby
that's viable aborted,'' said Martinez, who said he supports state
funding of abortion for poor women only in cases of rape or incest
or if the woman's life is threatened.
   Asked about polls that indicated most Floridians were
pro-choice, Martinez said, ``It depends which polls you look at.
... I've seen enough polls to know that people do not want abortion
to be a system of birth control. I'm also confident that the
Floridians do not want to see a viable baby aborted.''

<HEAD>Soviet, Chinese and American Students Work Together on Play</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FARGO, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a tranquil, tree-lined park near the
prairie, teen-agers from China, the Soviet Union and the United
States have been writing a play they hope will help make their
dreams of peace come true.
   The script developed over the past two weeks opens with
characters from each country on a stage behind a mountain topped
with a star. Discord among them is represented by fog as they
struggle musically, occasionally striking a note of harmony.
   At the end of the play, the star on the mountain comes to the
characters, and pieces of the mountain form a bridge to the
audience.
   ``Our goal must be to show peace and friendship,'' said Shan
Jian, one of two 16-year-olds from Beijing who joined two others
from the Soviet Union and the United States in writing the script.
   The Chinese participants are leaving Thursday, but next summer,
15 students from China and the Soviet Union are expected to arrive
in Fargo to work with young American artists on the performance.
The play, financed through an assortment of private and public
sources, then is scheduled to tour the United States, the Soviet
Union and China.
   ``It's really a process to create a link between the people of
these nations,'' says Vicki Chepulis, director of the ``Imagine''
program at the Trollwood Performing Arts School.
   Set on a 44-acre park in this city of 100,000, Trollwood was
created in 1978 following the model of Washington's Wolf Trap, to
offer young people a chance to study the performing arts. More than
300 students come each summer.
   The involvement of the Soviet and Chinese students, who arrived
last month, began with a visit by Trollwood founder John Marks to
China in 1986. He proposed an exchange, about the same time
Chepulis was proposing an exchange with students from the Soviet
Union.
   ``In our own naive way, we said, `Why don't we do both?'''
Chepulis recalled. Officials in China and the Soviet Union
supported the idea.
   ``What we really strive for is creativity and confidence,''
Marks said, ``with the attitude that you need to be friends before
you can write a play.
   ``To me, the whole way this project started was a dream.
Everybody wants to have a peaceful world. What better way to show
that than through the arts?''
   The play, with a working title ``Imagine,'' aims to be a
celebration of the three cultures and a challenge to others to
imagine what it would be like if people of all countries could work
together.
   It is designed as a rock opera with the story conveyed through
music and movement instead of words.
   One of the Chinese student advisers is Ding Zhen Chun, 49, whose
performance as the ``Monkey King'' is a highlight of the Beijing
Opera. Ding said he was not worried that the recent violence that
followed student demonstrations in China would threaten the
program, even though it did delay the students' arrival in Fargo.
But they preferred not to talk about it.
   ``What it really made me realize is that it was just people to
people, and that's all we were interested in. I think ... they just
wanted to focus the project,'' Chepulis said.

<HEAD>Garcia Marquez Awarded Prize For Contributing To Latin Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unity and freedom of Latin America is a
``dream within a dream'' that must soon become reality, author
Gabriel Garcia Marquez said Wednesday as he accepted an award for
his contributions to the fulfillment of that dream.
   ``In his prose, Gabriel Garcia Marquez presents the various
facets of the vision of a single Latin America,'' Jose Juan de
Olloqui, chairman of Banca Serfin, told 300 people at the Mexican
presidential residence.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari presented the Serfin Prize
to the Nobel prize-winning author but made no remarks. The prize
carries no monetary award, a bank official said.
   Garcia Marquez grappled with the problem of Latin unity in his
latest book, ``The General in his Labyrinth,'' a controversial
novel cast as a deathbed narrative by Simon Bolivar, a hero of
South America's independence from Spain.
   Bolivar's goal was not just independence but the creation of a
united Latin American federation to compete with the United States
in North America. That vision dissolved into the separate nations,
including Bolivar's Greater Colombia, now Colombia, Venezuela,
Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru.
   The book has created a literary controversy because it deals
with a sensitive subject and because of its demythologizing
portrayal of the man known as ``the Liberator'' as a foul-mouthed
libertine.
   In his brief remarks, Garcia Marquez began by recounting a story
by Italian author Italo Calvino in which an emperor of China asks a
painter to portray a crab.
   The painter replies that it will take five years and he'll need
a house with 12 servants. When the five years are up, he asks for
another five years.
   When the emperor comes back again, the painter rises, snatches
up his brush and in an instant paints the most beautiful crab ever
seen.
   ``In this story from ancient China you can see a crude
representation of artistic creation, the most incomprehensible and
enslaving of human passions,'' Garcia Marquez said.
   The 20th century, which has ``unleashed the furies of the atom
as a servant of death, and seen a flag planted on the windless
wastes of the moon,'' might be just another of man's many lost
centuries if if were not for a dream.
   ``Let us dream aloud, then. Let us dream that a fundamental
change has started in the world, that the craziest concentration of
power in the history of mankind is ending because the dogmas that
sustained the two sides are breaking down, and we are headed for a
new millenium dominated by the freedom of creative thought.''
   Inside those dreams, Garcia Marquz said, lies Bolivar's dream,
the dream of a united Latin America, ``finally part of the torrent
of history, made up of our invincible culture, our inspired
nightmares, our crazy magic, of the disasters that revive us, and
the irresistible power of the imagination.
   ``Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Latin Americans all, I
think it is time for us to draw the crab.''

<HEAD>Cost of Farming Continues to Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of running the nation's farms rose
7.5 percent to $118.4 billion in 1988, with farmers paying the bulk
of their money for basics such as feed, stock and machinery, the
Agriculture Department reported Wednesday.
   Despite the increase, the figure falls short of the record
$131.8 billion farmers spent in 1981, just before the general
financial crunch that stalled expansion in the agricultural sector.
   In 1987, farmers spent $110.1 billion for the buildings, feed,
livestock, rent, labor, seeds and plants, fuels, equipment and
other components of raising livestock and crops.
   Average expenditures per farm last year were $54,956, an
increase of $4,165 from 1987.
   The increase outstripped the nation's overall inflation rate,
which was 4.4 percent last year.
   Farms with annual sales of more than $100,000 averaged $271,481
in expenditures and accounted for 68 percent of the total expenses.
They spent most of their money on services, feed, labor, livestock
and poultry, farm machinery, interest and fertilizer.
   Farms with sales of $40,000 to $100,000 had expenses averaging
$75,371 and contributed 16 percent of the total. Their main
expenses were services, feed and machinery.
   Small farms, those with sales under $40,000, averaged expenses
of $15,464 and accounted for 15 percent of the total. Feed, farm
services and farm machinery were the leading expenses.
   Feed was the highest single cost item at $17.9 billion dollars
in 1988, accounting for 15.1 percent of total costs. The previous
year, feed cost $14.9 billion dollars and accounted for 13.5
percent of expenses, the highest single expense item that year as
well.
   The livestock and poultry that devour that feed cost $13.6
billion, accounting for 11.5 percent of the total. Last year, the
cattle, swine and poultry, including stud services, cost $10.7
billion, accounting for 9.7 percent of the total.
   The machinery to do the farm work cost $11.5 billion, for 9.7
percent of total expenses, up from $10.9 billion.
   A composite category _ farm services, including rent, _ was the
largest one, $24.6 billion, accounting for 21 percent of the
nation's production expenses. That's up from $24 billion in 1987.
   That category includes cash and share rent, vet supplies and
services, marketing and storage expenses, insurance, utilities,
leasing and transportation.
   The only expenses to drop were interest payments, which
decreased 3.7 percent to $8.37 billion, and building and fencing,
which dropped 10.3 percent to $2.23 billion.
   The analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not
include figures for net income or profits.
   Annual spending by farmers reached its nadir this decade in
1986, when many massively cut back their capital investments during
a time of plummeting land values and rising debt burdens.

<HEAD>Japan's Governing Party Poised to Pick Ex-minister to Lead Nation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Cabinet minister with reform credentials
emerged Wednesday as the clear front-runner for prime minister
after maneuvering within the governing party, which is beset by
scandal and plummeting popularity.
   Former education minister Toshiki Kaifu was the only declared
candidate after a day of meetings by Liberal Democratic Party
leaders. The party is expected to elect a new party president on
Tuesday and then vote him in as prime minister on Aug. 10.
   With its large majority in the lower house of Parliament, the
party can be assured of victory in the vote for prime minister.
   Kaifu, 58, gained support, though lukewarm, from enough party
factions to make him the leading contender. No other strong
candidate was put forward, but other people could still be
championed until Saturday morning.
   The former minister would succeed Prime Minister Sousuke Uno. He
resigned last month after only eight weeks in office in the wake of
a sex scandal and a severe loss in the July 23 election for the
upper house of Parliament. Uno was accused of keeping paid
mistresses.
   Kaifu belongs to one of the smallest factions in the
conservative governing party, a position that normally would have
made him an unlikely choice for high office. In addition, he has
not held the key Cabinet posts or top party jobs that are normally
part of a prime minister's background.
   But leaders of all the bigger party factions are tainted by
responsibility for the election defeat or by a bribery scandal that
toppled Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita.
   ``I hope I can get as much support from the party as possible,''
Kaifu told reporters after his faction united behind him. ``I'm
overwhelmed by the honor and will do my best.''
   He said it was too early to answer questions about details of
his policy ideas. ``But political reform is the biggest issue that
has been raised by the people,'' he said.
   Party members have called for political reform to help restore
public trust eroded by the bribery scandal.
   Kaifu acknowledged he had accepted political donations from the
company at the hub of the scandal, the Recruit Co. information
conglomerate.
   He said Recruit had contributed about $110,000 to his political
coffers over five years, but the money had been properly reported.
Kaifu said he stopped receiving Recruit money after the scandal
emerged last year.
   Kaifu, a longtime member of the lower house of Parliament,
belongs to the political reform committee set up by the party to
deal with the scandal.
   From 1974 to 1976, he was deputy chief Cabinet secretary under
the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, who sought to clean up Japan's
money politics when he succeeded scandal-plagued Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka.
   Kaifu later served as education minister for two periods of
about a year each.
   His candidacy had been rumored since the weekend, when party
Secretary-General Ryutaro Hashimoto's bid began to falter.
   Kaifu became the clear front-runner Wednesday after his mentor
and faction leader, 78-year-old Toshio Komoto, said he had decided
not to run.
   The next prime minister must deal not only with the party's
scandals but also with widespread opposition to a new 3 percent
sales tax.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Finds Holds Of Taiwanese Vessel Filled With Salmon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Coast Guard personnel who boarded a
Taiwanese drift net vessel suspected of involvement in a scheme to
sell $1.3 million worth illegally caught fish reported Wednesday
that its holds were filled with salmon.
   Taiwanese enforcement officers and observers from the Coast
Guard cutter Morganthau boarded the Sung Ching No. 1 early
Wednesday about 75 miles off Taiwan.
   The Morganthau had been shadowing the Sung Ching No. 1 for more
than two weeks in the North Pacific as the State Department sought
permission from the government of Taiwan for U.S. personnel to
board. The Taiwanese initially refused, then decided to dispatch
their own law enforcement officials to the ship and allow a
joint-boarding party.
   ``All the holds were filled with salmon,'' said Carolyn Feldman,
a spokeswoman at the Coast Guard's Pacific Command in Alameda,
Calif.
   After the boarding, the vessel was turned over to Taiwanese
officials.
   The State Department demanded that the vessel's crew be
prosecuted under Taiwanese law, which restricts the export of
salmon and limits where Taiwanese drift net vessels are allowed to
fish.
   The Sung Ching No. 1 was one of at least two Taiwanese drift net
vessels implicated in the illegal sale of salmon to U.S. undercover
agents posing as fish buyers in a six-month sting operation.
   Last month, federal agents arrested two Taiwanese men as they
emerged from a Seattle bank vault carrying more than $1 million in
cash allegedly received as payment for 500 metric tons of illegally
caught fish.
   At the same time the arrests were made, the Sung Ching No. 1 and
another Taiwanese ship were rendezvousing with the U.S. government
chartered fishing tender Redfin north of Midway Island to deliver
the fish.
   When the captains of the two vessels boarded the Redfin to
arrange details of the fish transfer they were detained, but their
vessels fled as the Morganthau approached.
   While the Morganthau tracked the Sung Ching No. 1, the Redfin
followed the other boat for several days before running short of
supplies and heading for Alaska.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the discovery of a ``huge
quantity'' of salmon aboard the Sung Ching No. 1 gives Taiwanese
authorities ``plenty of evidence to go along with what we have
already provided, and it is up to them to throw the book at these
outlaws.''
   U.S. fishing groups claim that illegal drift netting by vessels
from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea has already had a serious impact
on salmon runs in Alaska, Washington state and Oregon.

   Federal savings and loan regulators have
authorized the nation's eighth largest thrift institution to become
a commercial bank, potentially reducing revenue to the beleaguered
fund insuring S&amp;L deposits by millions of dollars.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in a decision late Tuesday,
said Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of San Diego could
leave the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   Home Federal is only one of several big S&amp;Ls trying to escape
FSLIC and join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the commercial
bank fund which charges its members less for the same federal
insurance of $100,000 per account.
   But, before the S&amp;L can become HomeFed Bank, it must secure
permission from California S&amp;L and bank regulators and from the
FDIC, a process expected to take at least several months.
   The bank board's decision is generating criticism in Congress,
which hopes to pass legislation this week committing taxpayers to
spending billions of dollars to bail out the S&amp;L industry.
   As part of the price for the bailout, S&amp;Ls will continue to pay
higher insurance premiums than banks for the next five years, even
if they convert to a bank.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee, said regulators may have had no choice but to rule in
favor of Home Federal. But, he added, ``I think it's awful. It
sends a terrible signal. ... If there was a legal way to avoid the
decision, it should have been done.''
   Home Federal is hoping to get out of FSLIC under a provision of
1987 banking legislation that permits institutions to leave
provided they applied before March 31, 1987. Home Federal filed its
applications to the FDIC and state regulators a day before the
deadline.
   It is unclear, however, if that loophole will still be good if
Home Federal, as expected, is unable to complete its conversion
before Congress enacts new S&amp;L legislation, which has provisions
that would supersede the law passed two years ago.
   John Buchman, a bank board staff attorney, said the Home Federal
decision will not set a precedent favorable to several other large
S&amp;Ls trying to bolt the FSLIC.
   Two Los Angeles-based S&amp;Ls _ Home Savings of America and Great
Western, the largest and second-largest thrifts in the nation _ are
also trying to leave FSLIC.
   The bank board denied Great Western's application and, in June,
the thrift lost an attempt to overturn the decision in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles. It is appealing the ruling.
   The bank board has until October to rule on the application from
Home Savings of America.
   The bank board has allowed 13 other S&amp;Ls to secede from the
FSLIC under the 1987 law, all considerably smaller than Home
Federal.
   Home Federal, ranked eighth in the nation with $17.2 billion in
assets at the end of May, has about 200 branches throughout
California. Last year, it paid $13.7 million more in insurance
premiums than it would have as a bank.
   Both bank and S&amp;L premiums would be raised under the S&amp;L bill,
but Home Federal would still pay about $9 million less in premiums
as a bank.

<HEAD>Senior State Department Official To Visit Sudan on Aid Cutoff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior U.S. official will visit Sudan on
Sunday to decide whether Washington should freeze $108 million in
aid because of a military coup a month ago, a Western official said.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
is to determine whether U.S. law requires the funding cutoff, which
would not affect about $100 million in annual humanitarian aid, the
official told foreign reporters.
   Section 513 to the U.S. 1987 Foreign Assistance Act stipulates
that economic aid must cease to a country where a democratically
elected government is removed in violation of the country's
constitution, said the official on condition of anonymity.
   Fiji in 1986 became the first country to have its U.S. aid
halted under provisions of Section 513, he said.
   However, the law, known as Section 513, ``includes a waiver
provision related to national security interests of the United
States,'' he said.
   ``Cohen will explore the possibility of using the waiver,
depending on how the new Sudanese government will deal with certain
issues,'' the official said.
   He said said Cohen will study the position of Lt. Gen. Omar
Hassan el-Bashir, who with other middle-level field-grade officers
overthrew Sudanese Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's government on
June 30.
   The official said Cohen will gauge el-Bashir's stands on two key
sore points between the United States and el-Mahdi. One is ending
the southern Sudan civil war and the other is allowing delivery of
relief supplies to southerners suffering from a famine the
6-year-old war has caused.
   The law puts at stake $108 million committed to Sudan, the
official said.
   Already, $22 million in development and economic aid has been
frozen since January under rules requiring it after a country faces
back debt payments on U.S. government loans for more than a year.
   But the official stressed that neither Section 513 nor that
rule, called the Brooke Amendment, affect U.S. humanitarian aid to
Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries. That amounted to $100
million dollars in the past year.
   He said Washington believes el-Bashir is ready to take the steps
necessary to end the war.
   President Hosni Mubarak, who last month took over as chairman of
the Organization of African Unity, already began mediating between
el-Bashir and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is
supported by Ethiopia.
   Exploratory peace talks are to start in the Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa this week.
   The Western official said he believes the talks may succeed
because both Sudan and Ethiopia are economically exhausted by the
long struggle.
   Cohen's African tour started in Cairo to see how the United
States can help Mubarak, as OAU chairman, end several regional
African conflicts. Among them are those between Somalia and
Mauritania and Chad and Libya.
   Africa's foreign debt, estimated at $250 billion, is another
item on Cohen's agenda during his tour, which also will take him to
Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Red Cross Launches Campaign To Prevent Child Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross launched a national
campaign Wednesday aimed at preventing child deaths from choking,
suffocation and drowning.
   The Infant and Child CPR Campaign encourages parents,
grandparents, baby sitters and other care-givers to learn how to
handle breathing emergencies in infants and children.
   Actress Lynda Carter, who has an 18-month-old boy, lent her name
to the campaign.
   ``There's a lot a parent can do before the ambulance arrives,''
said Robert Burnside, director of health services for the American
Red Cross.
   The Heimlich maneuver, however, is not among them.
   That method of using abdominal thrusts to dislodge obstructions
in the breathing passages works on choking adults but does more
harm than good when used on a baby, Burnside said.
   A choking baby needs to be held in a certain way and be given a
series of blows to the back and thrusts to the chest to restore
breathing, he said.
   The technique taught in the American Red Cross Infant and Child
CPR course was highlighted in a segment of the CBS daytime drama
``The Young and the Restless'' Wednesday when a choking emergency
occurred to a young child.
   Besides choking emergencies, the seven-hour Red Cross course
teaches mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and injury prevention.
   Thousands of children who die from choking, suffocation and
drowning could be saved if more adults knew how to respond to the
emergencies, Burnside said.
   Choking and suffocation are leading causes of accidental deaths
in children under 1 year old, according to the Johns Hopkins
University Injury Prevention Center.
   Among children ages 1-4, drowning is the second leading cause of
accidental deaths after motor vehicle accidents.

<HEAD>Plant Workers Say Government Lied on Nuclear Health Hazards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at government nuclear weapons plants
told a congressional panel Wednesday they were deceived for decades
by superiors on the health hazards of working with radioactive
materials such as plutonium and uranium.
   ``We were told the levels were too low to harm us,'' said David
Day, a worker and union official at the Fernald uranium processing
plant in Ohio. He said superiors told him over the years that
handling the radioactive materials ``was like working with lead''
and no more a risk than crossing the street.
   The testimony came before the Senate Government Affairs
Committee, which said there have been at least 30 studies over the
years describing various health problems among workers and
residents near the Energy Department facilities.
   ``The historical record provides little comfort,'' said
committee chairman Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. He said workers at
plant sites must be assured they are protected from health and
safety dangers and be provided accurate information on health risks.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins acknowledged the department's
program to determine the health hazards facing weapons plant
workers is ``a mess.'' He said the department has no clear picture
of how much physical harm workers have suffered over the years from
exposure to radioactive materials and wastes.
   Watkins said that when he took over the department in March, he
found the program to follow such health effects ``buried deep
within the bureaucracy ... understaffed, under funded and under
utilized.''
   But he balked at suggestions by Glenn and other senators that an
outside agency should oversee the department's monitoring program.
``I now it's a mess. I need people to clean it up more than I need
oversight right now,'' Watkins testified.
   The department's own information is so bad, said Watkins, he has
relied heavily on outside scientific review panels.
   ``Sometimes the reports coming in from the field are not really
true,'' said the secretary.
   He said statistical information on past worker exposure to
radiation at and near the plants is being examined again to more
accurately guage the health risks. He also said information on the
health of 600,000 present and past plant workers is being assembled
and will be made available to outside scientists, but the central
data bank is not expected to be completed until 1995.
   The secretary promised a shakeup in the department's health
monitoring program and said it would be opened to review by an
outside committee of experts.
   A panel of plant workers and union representatives voiced
similar concerns.
   The history of the Energy Department on health and safety issues
``is one of denial, coverup, inefficiency and betrayal,'' declared
Robert Wages, a vice president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union. The union represents 5,000 workers at various
nuclear weapons facilities.
   Wages said questions about worker safety and exposure to
hazardous materials was raised nearly two decades ago in
congressional hearings and elsewhere, but nothing changed.
   Wages and other union officials, as well as several present
employees at plants, said too often workers have kept silent for
fear of losing their jobs and because of repeated assurances that
the health concerns were being exaggerated by critics.
   ``We are the guinea pigs. We perform important and dangerous
work, but are made to feel expendable,'' said Jesse Abney, 55, a
chemical operator at the Fernald plant in Ohio.
   Tests have shown Abney to have plutonium in his body and uranium
in his lungs.
   ``Despite my precautions (at work over the years) I am
contaminated,'' he told the senators and noted rumors the
government may close the Fernald plant in the near future.
   ``Will I be able to find another job and still support my
family? Would another company be willing to cover me under their
health insurance?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Survey: Many Teachers Feel More Training Needed on Child Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elementary-school teachers are underreporting
child-abuse cases because they aren't adequately trained to
recognize or deal with them, according to a study released
Wednesday.
   Fifty-seven percent of the more than 2.1 million reports of
child abuse and neglect in 1986 involved school-age children, but
only 16.3 percent of all reports filed with child-protective
agencies originated with school personnel, said the study by the
National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse.
   ``The results of the survey point out a major problem in our
efforts to prevent child abuse,'' said committee Executive Director
Anne H. Cohn.
   All states require teachers to report instances of child abuse,
Ms. Cohn said.
   But the committee's survey found that only 50 percent of the 480
elementary-school teachers polled had received any training in the
identification, reporting and prevention of such cases, she said.
Most who said they received such training said it was inadequate.
   The teachers surveyed taught first grade through sixth grade in
39 school districts nationwide, Ms. Cohn said.
   The Chicago-based committee, described as a national,
volunteer-based organization, tried to assess teachers' knowledge,
attitudes and beliefs about child abuse, as well as their opinions
on reporting child abuse and on prevention programs.
   Seventy-two percent of the teachers surveyed said they suspected
that at least one of their students had been abused or neglected,
and 90 percent said they had reported such cases, Ms. Cohn said.
   However, reports commonly went to other school personnel, such
as a principal, social worker or nurse. Only about 20 percent of
the teachers said they reported abuse directly to child-protective
agencies, as required by most states' laws.
   Only 57 percent of those polled said their districts had clearly
defined polices on reporting suspicions of child abuse. Twenty-four
percent didn't know if their districts had such policies, although
95 percent of the nation's districts say they have clearly set
guidelines for teachers to follow, Ms. Cohn said.
   ``Not only are many teachers unaware of the existence of those
school policies, but many do not seem to understand the policies
that do exist,'' she said.
   According to the survey, teachers are concerned about the legal
ramifications of reporting child abuse even though most states
grant immunity from lawsuits to teachers who report child-abuse
suspicions in good faith, Ms. Cohn said.
   Ms. Cohn said her organization believes administrators need to
``dramatically expand the education they provide their teachers so
that ... teachers can feel much more comfortable and much more
competent in their ability to identify and report child abuse.''
   The survey also asked teachers about corporal punishment and
found that 57 percent felt it should be eliminated.
   Robert Fathman, chairman of the National Coalition to Abolish
Corporal Punishment in Schools, said the drive to stop corporal
punishment received a big boost this year, with eight states
banning the practice.
   ``For the first time in the history of our country's education
system, more than half of the school children in the U.S. now
attend schools that have prohibited hitting, slapping, punching,
hair-pulling, paddling or other firms of corporal punishment by
educators,'' Fathman said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is forecast to become a net importer of
rice for the first time in recent history, helping create a record
worldwide trade in rice in 1989, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   The report, ``Rice: Situation and Outlook Yearbook,'' says
China, Indonesia and India are fueling this year's record demand,
with trade forecast at 13.4 million metric tons.
   The previous record was 13.1 million metric tons set in 1981,
the report said.
   Although the United States will increase its exports 10 percent
this year to 2.5 million metric tons, Thailand will be the big
winner, exporting a record 5.5 million metric tons.
   The U.S. share of the export, 19 percent, and the Thai share, 41
percent, will be the same as last year, the USDA said.
   China has already bought 950,000 tons from Thailand, which has
been exporting rice at ``an extraordinary pace'' since August 1988,
the report said. China is expected to buy 1.2 million tons of rice
this year from all sources, the report said. That is triple the
amount bought the previous year.
   The report said ``it is unclear how or if the current turmoil in
China will affect its short-term rice trade.''
   ``There have been few reports of exports in the first half of
1989, and China is forecast to export only 300,000 tons by the end
of the year, less than half the amount it exported in 1988,'' the
report said.
   China, India and Indonesia will also account for about a 5
percent drop in the 1990 market when their crops improve and stocks
are replenished. India and China account for over 50 percent of the
world's rice production.
   China imports rice to feed its urban populations. In the
forecast for 1990 contained in the report, the department cites
reports that farmers will keep more rice on the farm because of the
government system of paying farmers with IOUs that cannot be
redeemed immediately.
   Indonesia is forecast to import 400,000 tons and India will
likely take in 500,000 tons, the report says.
   China and India are expecting record crops in the crop year
1989-1990.
   Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas
are the main rice-growing states. The main U.S. customers are
Europe, the Middle East, South America and Africa.
   Low stocks and strong import demand caused world prices to soar
starting in January. They reached $8.91 per hundredweight in July,
after having fallen to $5.90 in December 1988. Recent prices were
at their lowest in 1986-1987, when abundant world prices kept them
down as far as $3.78 a hundredweight.
   U.S. farmers are planting 2.8 million acres in rice this year, 5
percent less than a year ago, the department estimates. Yields are
unlikely to show improvement, meaning a drop in production, the
department says.

   A twin-engine plane crashed on takeoff
Wednesday at Albany's airport, getting barely aloft before tumbling
to the ground and exploding in flames. Six people were killed,
authorities said.
   The Beechcraft Queen Air BE-80 was bound for Akron, Ohio,
according to William Hoefer, an air traffic controller at Southwest
Georgia Regional Airport.
   The plane had climbed only about 10 feet off the ground when its
right engine caught fire, witnesses said.
   The plane's right wing then slammed into the ground, spewing
fuel as the aircraft cartwheeled several times, the witnesses
reported.
   The plane, engulfed in flames, came to rest upside down and
broken apart near the control tower.
   The fire prevented any rescue, witnesses said. ``There's not
much you can do when that gas ignited,'' said off-duty Eastern
Airlines pilot Doug Powell, who saw the crash.
   Rescue crews left the victims' bodies in the wreckage until
investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board could examine it, said Fire
Chief J.D. Jansen.
   ``As far as we can determine now we have six fatalities,'' said
Jansen.
   Six people, including the pilot, were driven by van from the
terminal and boarded the plane minutes before takeoff, said Linda
Bradshaw of Gray Air Service, the van's driver.
   The victims were not immediately identified.
   The plane was registered to Rainbow Properties of Sarasota,
Fla., according to Vedder Steed of the FAA in Atlanta.

<TEXT>
   A U.N. official went to southern Lebanon
Wednesday to press the search for the body of a slain American
hostage as a glimmer of hope came from the Shiite Moslem camp that
a second hostage would be spared.
   The victim, U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was on U.N.
duty when he was abducted.
   Shiite sources said they expected kidnappers threatening the
life of Joseph Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., to spare him at
Iran's behest to avert a confrontation with the United States.
   Pro-Iranian kidnappers said they hanged Higgins on Monday in
retaliation for Israel's abduction Friday of a Lebanese Shiite
cleric. The colonel was seized Feb. 17, 1988, near Tyre in south
Lebanon.
   The Vatican said Pope John Paul II, at President Bush's request,
would assist in efforts to have Higgins' body returned to the
United States.
   Bush said Wednesday he is ``leaving no stone unturned'' in
trying to free American hostages but lacks hard information as he
tries to deal with the crisis ``in a prudent way.''
   He said he contacted many world leaders and ``We have had
assurance after assurance ... they want to help.''
   British officials in London said Bush and Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher talked for 20 minutes about the crisis.
   A videotape the kidnappers provided shows a man, apparently
Higgins, hanging from a gallows. No body has been found and there
is no way of knowing when the tape was made. Some reports have said
Higgins was killed months ago.
   Pentagon officials said the USS Belknap, flagship of the U.S.
6th Fleet, and the fleet commander canceled a visit to Sevastopol
in the Soviet Union in case Bush needs them, but said a military
strike was unlikely. The aircraft carrier America cut short a visit
to Singapore, they said.
   Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping
operations, flew to U.N. headquarters in the Lebanese border town
of Naqoura by helicopter from Israel.
   He met with Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren, Swedish commander of
the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, and battalion commanders of the
nine-nation force known as UNIFIL to investigate Higgins' death and
try to find his body.
   UNIFIL spokesman Timor Goksel said Goulding put off going to
Beirut because of the fighting but would try to make the trip
Thursday. Christian forces and a Syrian-led Moslem alliance have
fought an artillery war in Beirut for five months.
   The undersecretary-general is scheduled to meet with Lebanese
leaders in Beirut, but Goksel would not identify them.
   ``There are no negotiations involved, although he has a
secondary mission of trying to find out about other hostages in
Lebanon,'' the spokesman said.
   Sixteen Westerners are captives in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Higgins, 44, commanded a 75-man observer team attached to the
5,800-member UNIFIL force.
   Cicippio's captors, who call themselves the Revolutionary
Justice Organization, said Monday he would be killed unless Israel
freed Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid by 6 p.m. the next day.
   Two hours after the Tuesday deadline, the kidnappers announced a
``non-extendable postponement'' of 48 hours. No specific hour on
Thursday was mentioned as a new deadline.
   The statement cited a plea for mercy from Cicippio's Lebanese
wife, Elham, and other ``friendly appeals and sincere behests.''
   Mrs. Cicippio said Wednesday: ``Even if it was a postponement
for only one minute, it's better than nothing.''
   Shiite sources said Iran might have stepped in to save Cicippio
because of the international uproar created by Higgins' death.
   An organization caling itself the Organization of the Oppressed
on Earth claimed to hold Higgins.
   Nearly all the groups holding hostages are believed to be fronts
for Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Shiite movement in which Obeid is
a spiritual leader.
   Israel has offered to exchange Obeid and other Shiite prisoners
for the foreign hostages and three of its soldiers held prisoner in
Lebanon, but Hezbollah rejected the deal.
   Moshe Arens, the Israeli foreign minister, said Wednesday there
was a ``good possibility'' hostages would be freed, but other
officials said negotiations could be lengthy.
   Iran sponsors Hezbollah, which also holds two of the three
Israeli soldiers.
   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid, 33, and two aides from his
home in Jibchit, a south Lebanon village.
   Hezbollah denies any connection with the hostages, but publicly
endorsed the Oppressed on Earth group when it claimed
responsibility for Higgins' abduction.
   One Lebanese Shiite source said: ``The Iranians probably are
bringing immense pressure on their Lebanese surrogates, seeking to
defuse the crisis generated by Higgins' murder. They can do without
a showdown with the United States.''
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, just elected president of Iran, has sought
improved relations with the West in the past in hopes of aid in
rebuilding from eight years of war with Iraq.
   Other Shiite sources said the emergence of Rafsanjani as Iran's
most powerful politician had meant a decline in the influence over
Hezbollah of a hard-line rival, Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi.
   Analysts say the hostages' fate may be dictated by the struggle
between those known as pragmatists, led by Rafsanjani, and
hard-liners over the direction of Iran's 10-year-old Islamic
revolution.
   The first Shiite source noted that Revolutionary Justice is not
known to have killed a hostage, but has issued death threats in the
past.
   The Revolutionary Justice statement announcing the 48-hour
postponement for Cicippio was accompanied by a picture of another

   A U.S. man whose Costa Rican ranch allegedly served
as a way station for guns-for-drugs trades to aid the Contra rebels
surfaced here Wednesday after fleeing an indictment in that Central
American nation.
   John Hull, who was out on $37,500 bond on charges he violated
Costa Rican neutrality and trafficked in cocaine, said he slipped
away about a week ago.
   The drug counts were dropped Wednesday by a judge, but the
neutrality charges remain.
   In the United States, the 69-year-old rancher faces a subpoena
by a Senate subcommittee looking into similar charges, as well as a
Justice Department investigation into an allegation he fraudulently
obtained a $375,000 U.S. development loan.
   Hull vehemently denied all the accusations Wednesday in an
interview with The Associated Press, saying the charges against him
were really charges against the U.S. government.
   ``The Costa Ricans are accusing the United States government,
the CIA, the past president and the current president of being drug
traffickers,'' he said.
   The former Evansville, Ind., resident, who has lived in Costa
Rica for 20 years, said he was just a ``patriotic American'' who
gave humanitarian aid to the Contras seeking to overthrow
Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   He said the accusations had been pushed by communists and ``drug
people.''
   U.S. prosecutors say they have no evidence to support the drug
charges, but insist Hull was more active than he admits in helping
former National Security Council aide Oliver North aid the Contras
even after Congress cut off funding.
   A chart prepared by then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Feldman
of Miami in 1986 put Hull directly under North and North's aide,
Robert Owen.
   Hull acknowledges receiving about $10,000 a month from Contra
leader Adolfo Calero to feed and supply the rebels, but denies
knowing the money was provided on North's orders.
   Hull also denied working for the National Security Council,
saying Owen was simply an ``old friend'' he knew through the office
of then-Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
   However, he said he had frequent contact with CIA agents.
   ``Constantly there were CIA people passing through the zone,''
he said. ``They would visit my house, they would ask questions
about locations of farms ... it was obvious they were wanting
information about air drops and so forth.
   ``The same as any patriotic American would do, I cooperated with
the agencies of my government,'' Hull said.
   Hull was most angry about testimony before a drug subcommittee
headed by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that airstrips on his ranch
were used as refueling and transfer stations by pilots bringing in
guns for the Contras and taking cocaine and marijuana back to the
United States.
   Convicted drug traffickers Jorge Morales and Gary Betzner
testified that they used Hull's ranch for cocaine flights. Other
witnesses, including former Panamanian official Jose Blandon, said
they knew of drugs passing through Hull's ranch.
   Hull said Wednesday that Morales and Betzner's testimony was
just an attempt to win lighter sentences.
   Kerry counsel Jonathan Winer said the subcommittee wanted to
talk to Hull as soon as possible.
   ``Hull is under subpoena and has been for a year, and we will
seek to serve him,'' Winer said. ``We've sought to serve him
before, but he has been in Costa Rica, and, from our point of view,
evading the subpoena.''
   Hull said he was willing to talk. However, he has accused Kerry
of being a communist, and, according to the subcommittee, at one
point tried to stall the panel's investigation by filing a flood of
false affidavits with the Justice Department.
   Hull may also have to talk to the Justice Department about
alleged fraud involving a 1983 loan from the U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corp.
   Hull blamed the agency, rather than himself, for any confusion
over the $375,000 loan, and insisted it has been paid back.
   Hull, saying he suffers from a heart condition and diabetes,
said he mainly returned to the United States to seek medical
treatment. He said he has no money, and intends to return to
Indiana until he is treated.
   ``Then I want to return to Costa Rica,'' he said. ``I have faith
in the Costa Rican judicial system.''

<HEAD>Officials Discuss Clean Air Plan with Environmental Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top administration officials met Wednesday
with environmental leaders to discuss criticisms of President
Bush's clean air plan, won praise for keeping an open White House
door but received no blanket commitment of support.
   Bush and his environmental advisory team invited the
environmentalists to discuss the acid rain provision of the clean
air package and promised later meetings on the airborne toxics and
urban smog sections which have prompted the most criticism from
environmental activists and members of Congress.
   The Environmental Defense Fund, which has praised Bush's
proposal to curb acid rain, will lobby for that aspect of the
president's package on Capitol Hill, spokesman Fred Krupp said
after the White House session.
   He said the acid rain portion ``is stronger than anything being
offered'' in competing legislation in Congress. He praised Bush for
``taking leadership'' on the environment that represented a ``sea
change'' from the Reagan administration.
   But Richard Ayres, of the National Resources Defense Council,
said his organization still has reservations about the provisions,
in part focusing on the way the White House calculated gaseous
emissions that cause acid rain.
   The administration claims its plan will result in a 10
million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from 1980 levels,
but the NRDC's calculations are it will be only 9 million tons
since 1 million ton reduction has already been achieved.
   The meeting was the latest effort by the administration to take
the offensive on its clean air bill after weeks of criticism from
environmental groups and their congressional backers.
   Bush dropped by the meeting only briefly, participants said.
   Environmental Protection Agency Assistant Administrator William
Rosenberg said the meeting was called to ``continue the dialogue''
with environmental groups.
   However, he insisted the administration was not positioning to
make changes in the bill it sent to Congress last month.
   ``We're talking about clarifying our position, their position.
Sometimes there are interpretation questions that need to be raised
where we say one thing and different people read it for different
results. At this point it's an information discussion and not a
negotiating session. The administration's bill stands as it is,''
he said.
   Last week, Rosenberg accused Democrats in Congress of making
``unfair and totally biased attacks'' on the legislation and of
falsely calling the proposal a sellout to industry.
   Ayres said the administration officials at the meeting were
``very upset by the criticism the bill has got from the
environmental community and members of Congress. We responded with
equal vehemence that we don't think you've been unfairly attacked.
We believe what we're saying is based on the facts.''
   Administration officials have complained that the environmental
critics are nitpicking the bill after the administration solicited
their views and addressed many of their concerns in the package.
   ``They certainly would like us to be more positive than we have
been. I would like to be more positive than we've been able to
be,'' Ayres said.
   Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Foundation, praised the administration for continued consultation
with the environmentalists.
   ``Clearly they were stating that they were opening the door and
it's up to us to work with them,'' he said.
   But a number of organizations in the main environmental lobbying
group, the National Clean Air Coalition, were not invited _
including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental
Action, the American Lung Association and the AFL-CIO.
   Ayres, director of the coalition, said he was invited only 15
minutes before the session, after he complained to administration
officials.
   But White House spokesman Steve Hart said it had been thought
that Ayres might be more appropriately invited to the later
sessions on urban smog and toxics than to Wednesday's meeting on
acid rain.
   An EPA source, speaking only on condition he not be named, said
the White House issued the invitations, and both EPA Administrator
William Reilly and Rosenberg ``were shocked that Ayres was not
invited.'' The source said the two EPA officials demanded that the
White House invite Ayres.
   ``The point they may have misjudged somewhat is that the
coalition works together,'' Ayres said. ``I speak for the
coalition.''
   The director of Environmental Action, Casey Padgett, accused the
White House of trying to ``fracture the coalition.''
   Others invited included representatives of the Wilderness
Society, Conservation Foundation, National Wildlife Foundation,
Sierra Club, and National Audubon Society.

   Leftist guerrillas fought
overnight battles with government soldiers on San Salvador's
northern outskirts, and others attacked at least four towns
Wednesday.
   Six people were reported killed and more than 10 wounded in the
towns. At least one soldier and a civilian were killed and three
people were wounded in the battles Tuesday night in San Ramon and
Mejicanos, working-class areas on the city's northern edge.
   Venceremos, the guerrilla radio station, said the attacks on
towns were part of a rebel campaign against ``the fascist
government'' of President Alfredo Cristiani and ``increases in
transportation costs and repression in general.''
   Cristiani's conservative administration lifted price controls on
about 200 consumer items and services earlier this week, including
transportation and electricity, in an effort to revive the
war-battered economy.
   Bus fares increased Wednesday, in some cases to almost double
their former levels. New electricity rates will be announced next
week.
   Guerrillas of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front has fought U.S.-supported governments for a decade. Human
rights groups say more than 70,000 people have been killed, most of
them civilians.
   Several rebel columns attacked military positions at San Pedro
Nonualco, 38 miles east of the capital, early Wednesday and one
civilian was killed in the fighting, the army press office said.
   A Venceremos broadcast told people to stay off the road in the
area because rebel forces had mined it.
   One rebel was killed and five were wounded in a guerrilla attack
on military positions in northern Chalatenango province, near the
Honduran border, and other rebel forces attacked San Jorge and
Carolina in San Miguel, an eastern province, the army said. There
were no reports on casualties in San Jorge and Carolina.
   Sgt. Ventura Lopez, who commands a squad of 10 soldiers in the
San Ramon district, one of the areas of overnight fighting, said
his post was attacked by about 60 rebels from the San Salvador
volcano northeast of the city.
   He said the guerrilas, armed with dynamite, assault rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades, were driven off by about 100 soldiers
from the Belloso infantry battalion.
   It was the fifth rebel attack in eight months on the San Ramon
army post. About 200 guerrillas are believed to be camped on the
volcano.

<HEAD>Justice Department May Crack Down on News Leakers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Officials who leak information to news
reporters about federal criminal investigations may be prosecuted
for theft of government property under a new policy announced
Wednesday by the Justice Department.
   The department has decided to narrow a 11-year-old policy
against prosecuting officials who leak information to inform the
public, John C. Keeney, a deputy assistant attorney general in the
criminal division, said in written testimony submitted to a
congressional hearing.
   In some circumstances, reporters may be called to testify at
grand juries to identify leakers, although a subpoena would not be
issued without the approval of the attorney general, Keeney said.
   This aspect of the new policy, which was unveiled at a joint
hearing of two House Judiciary subcommittees, means the change
could have little practical effect on leak investigations.
   Attorneys general historically have been unwilling to subpoena
reporters, who are usually the only source of evidence about who
leaked them information.
   But the new policy drew expressions of concern from civil
libertarians who said it could be used to undermine a reporters'
First Amendment protection against revealing confidential sources
of information.
   ``Once the government is able to say `we need this information
because it's material to a criminal investigation,' that raises the
question of whether or not the protection of a confidential source
is diluted,'' said Allan Adler, a Washington media lawyer and
former legislative counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``I think it would be a definite misuse of the statute. The
statute was not designed with that in mind at all,'' said Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of one of the subcommittees. ``It would
be a very dangerous practice.''
   The policy in force since 1978 stated that ``it is inappropriate
to bring a prosecution'' under the theft of government property law
if information is leaked to inform the public and wasn't obtained
by illegal means, such as wiretaps or trespassing, Keeney said in
testimony prepared for the committee.
   The guideline, contained in the United States Attorneys Manual,
was designed ``to protect `whistleblowers' and also to protect
members of the media from prosecution for receipt of stolen
property.''
   ``We have examined this policy and concluded it is too broad,'
Keeney said. ``Accordingly it is no longer applicable to government
employees who leak information obtained from a criminal
investigation.''
   ``Moreover, we will now consider prosecution of government
employees under section 641 (the theft statute) in leak cases not
arising out of criminal investigations if the employee's conduct
also violated some other provision such as the Privacy Act,''
Keeney said in his prepared statement.
   Such a leak could come from an FBI background investigation of
someone under consideration for a Cabinet position, such as former
Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, whose nomination to be defense secretary
was killed amidst allegations of womanizing and drinking.
   Leaks of information from the FBI background investigation of
Tower drew criticism from Congress and expressions of consternation
by the Bush administration.
   Keeney said the ``department is in the process of deciding
whether the policy should be changed in other respects.''
   Leslie Harris, legislative counsel at the ACLU, called Keeney's
announcement ``rather disturbing.''
   Keeney's testimony was delivered at a hearing convened in the
wake of congressional concern about leaks revealing a Justice
Department investigation into financial irregularities in the
office of Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   The investigation was disclosed during Gray's ultimately
successful campaign to become House majority whip. News reports of
the Gray case prompted Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to order a
leak investigation.

<TEXT>
   Luiz Gonzaga, a singer and
accordion player who almost singlehandedly popularized the lilting
music of Brazil's rural northeast, died Wednesday of pneumonia. He
was 76.
   Gonzaga suffered from osteoporosis, a disease that weakens the
bones, and had been hospitalized for more than a month in Recife,
1,500 miles northeast of Rio, hospital officials said by telephone.
   Gonzaga was born Dec. 13, 1912 in the remote town of Exu, in the
heart of the arid ``sertao,'' or outback.
   His father taught him to play the accordion, a popular
instrument in Brazil's rural northeast, and at 12 he was performing
regularly at local dances. In the 1940s he came to Rio, where
regional music then was virtually unknown.
   At first considered lowbrow, Gonzaga popularized the ``baiao''
and ``forro'' music. With his moon face and trademark leather hat,
typical of northeastern bandits, Gonzaga became a nationally known
figure.
   His music dealt almost exclusively with the hard life in the
poor northeast. His greatest success was ``Asa Branca,'' or ``White
Wing,'' about a peasant regretfully fleeing the drought-stricken
backlands but pledging to return when the rains came.
   Gonzaga's body was to be taken back to Exu for burial on Friday.

<HEAD>Conference Committee Puts Off Action On Ancient Forest Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators will meet in
September on legislation that would impose a 14-month ceasefire in
the battle over the ancient forests of Oregon and Washington state,
lawmakers said Wednesday.
   The lawmakers said the delay until after Congress' August recess
would give them more time to try to negotiate a compromise
acceptable to both the timber industry and environmentalists.
   ``If we can come up with a way to get the job done and soften
some of the criticism, we will certainly be looking for that,''
said Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash.
   The conference committee had originally been scheduled to meet
this week to discuss the spending bills for the Interior Department
and related agencies passed by the House and Senate.
   Congress is scheduled to recess at the end of the week until
after Labor Day.
   Environmentalists oppose the legislation, which would limit
their access to the courts to appeal timber sales during the
14-month grace period, and plan to use the month before the
conference committee meets to lobby against it.
   They say logging in the old-growth forests of the Northwest
destroys prime nesting areas for the rare northern spotted owl.
   Illinois Democratic Rep. Sidney Yates, chairman of the House
Appropriations interior subcommittee, put of the meeting of the
House-Senate conference committee because of major differences in
the versions of the spending bills adopted by the two chambers.
   The timber legislation is included as an amendment to the
Senate-passed version of the Interior spending bill, but not the
one approved by the House.
   Lawmakers said the legislation should ensure a short-term supply
of timber for the region's mills while protecting the old-growth
forests from logging. A permanent fix would still have to be
negotiated.
   The legislation would bar federal courts from suspending or
overturning any timber sales planned in federal forests of the
Northwest known to contain spotted owls through the end of fiscal
1990.
   In addition, the legislation requires that environmentalists
release more than half of the roughly two billion board feet of
timber currently enjoined from sale.
   If environmentalists do not agree to release the timber by Oct.
1, the legislation would allow the Forest Service and the Bureau of
Land Management to proceed with sales regardless of the injunctions.

   A senior policeman in Soweto
township and his two sons were injured Wednesday when attackers
tossed two grenades into his house, police said.
   Lt. Col. Fanyana Zwane and his 10-year-old son were slightly
hurt, while his 12-year-old son was seriously injured, said police
spokesman Joseph Mobeni.
   No group claimed responsibility, but militant anti-apartheid

   Zwane is one of the highest-ranking blacks in the South African
police and has worked in Soweto, the huge township outside
Johannesburg, for more than 15 years.
   Police have said that the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement is planning to increase attacks during the weeks
leading up to the segregated parliamentary elections on Sept. 6.
   There are separate polls for whites, Asians and people of
mixed-race, but the 28-million black majority is excluded.
   There have been several nighttime bombings during the past two

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Woman Forfeits $75,000 In Jewels After Missing Deadline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Sri Lankan woman has forfeited $75,000 worth of
sapphires she put up as a deposit and still owes $100,000 after
failing to meet the deadline to buy a bankrupt college for $10
million, officials said Wednesday.
   ``We're kind of back to square one. ... It's for sale again,''
said bankruptcy court trustee Duke Salisbury.
   Predominantly black Bishop College was closed by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Robert C. McGuire last year when officials of the
108-year-old school couldn't raise $1.85 million needed to cover
this school year's deficit.
   The school, which sits on a 200-acre plot in south Dallas, was
saddled with $18 million in debt; faculty and staff had worked
without pay for about two years and are owed about $900,000. A
portion of the land has been appraised at about $12.6 million.
   In April, a contract to purchase the school was awarded to
Aryadesh Inc., a group represented by Panditha Sujatha Nadarajah, a
Sri Lankan woman whose attorney said she had lived in Lubbock since
1985.
   Ms. Nadarajah is an internationally known Buddhist scholar and
planned to open an international university at the school, her
attorney, A.W. Clem, said in March.
   Ms. Nadarajah put up five sapphires worth $75,000 to seal the
deal, and agreed to pay an additional $100,000 to get a four-week
extension of the original July 4 deadline.
   After missing Tuesday's deadline to come up with the $10 million
to buy the college, Salisbury said Ms. Nadarajah has forfeited the
jewels, but has yet to pay the $100,000.
   ``We will have to make demands upon her for the $100,000 cash,''
said Salisbury.
   Proceeds from the sale of the jewels will go to creditors of the
college, Salisbury said.
   Ms. Nadarajah returned to Sri Lanka in July to raise the money
and Raoul Smyth, an attorney for Salisbury, said she apparently has
had trouble getting out of the island nation off the coast of India.
   Sri Lanka has been wracked by two years of fighting between
Sinhalese extremists, angered by peace overtures made to the
country's Tamil minority and by the continuing presence of Indian
peacekeeping troops, and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   When Salisbury recommended awarding the contract to Ms.
Nadarajah, he said: ``We have investigated her as best we can. It
seems that she does indeed have the money.''
   Ms. Nadarajah's attorney did not return phone calls Wednesday.
   Salisbury said he already had at least 10 inquiries about buying
the college Wednesday morning and hopes media attention will die
down.
   ``I've never had to conduct a business negotiation ... in front
of the likes of the media,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The House moved Wednesday to speed easy
passage of a taxpayer bailout of savings and loan losses as Senate
Republicans mounted a final attempt to prevent the costs from
swelling the federal deficit.
   The House Rules Committee set aside one hour of debate for
Thursday before a floor vote, anticipated to occur by noon, puts
the legislation's fate in the hands of senators deeply divided on
how to raise the $50 billion needed to close 500 insolvent S&amp;Ls and
pay off their depositors.
   Senate and House negotiators from both parties agreed last week
to President Bush's recommended massive overhaul of the way the
government regulates the nation's nearly 3,000 thrift institutions.
   And House Republicans generally have folded their opposition to
Democratic demands that the rescue money be borrowed through the
Treasury _ a move that would swell the deficit by some $9 billion
this year and $24 billion in fiscal 1990.
   However, the parties are deadlocked in the Senate, where 41
Republicans _ one more than needed to thwart the bill's approval _
have said in a letter they would hold out for Bush's elaborate
financing scheme.
   That effort was being led by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, co-author
of the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law mandating a federal
deficit no greater than $110 billion for the next fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush's bailout plan would raise the deficit at most only $5
billion a year by borrowing the money through higher-interest bonds
on the private market. Critics contend the higher interest rates
would cost taxpayers a total of $4.5 billion more than necessary
over the next 30 years.
   Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas on Tuesday threatened to
tie the S&amp;L measure to a bill raising the government's debt ceiling
above $2.8 trillion as a parliamentary tactic if the House tried to
recess for the rest of the month before the Senate votes.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., however, said Wednesday
he has no intention of recessing until after both the House and the
Senate have acted on the S&amp;L bill as well as the debt ceiling.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., another co-author of the
deficit-reduction law, said he remains solidly with Gramm but added
he did not know about the other 39 GOP senators who had signed the
Texas Republican's letter.
   ``I don't know what the vote count is, I don't think anybody
does,'' Rudman said.
   However, support for Gramm and the administration's efforts was
clearly waning among House Republicans.
   ``I understand the administration's concern, but it's a hard
thing to sell when you get everything else in place and have it
hung up on that one issue,'' said House GOP Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois. ``We've got some problems with our counterparts in the
Senate.''

   The remains of Hurricane Chantal produced heavy rain Wednesday
across north-central Texas, and rain also was scattered over other
sections of the South and the Northeast.
   More than 4 inches of rain fell during the morning at Ivan,
Texas, producing lowland flooding over eastern sections of Stephens
County, the National Weather Service said.
   Out to sea, Hurricane Dean had maximum sustained wind speed of
75 mph and was moving toward the west-northwest at 20 mph.
Hurricane warnings were issued for the islands of the Lesser
Antilles and Puerto Rico.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed in warm, humid,
unstable air from the Gulf Coast region to the southern Atlantic
Coast and Florida.
   An upper air disturbance produced thunderstorms that moved from
southeastern Ontario into western New York state. Showers and
thunderstorms were also scattered over northern New England.
   A cold front moved through the central Rockies and western
sections of the northern Plains. Behind the front were cooler air
and widely scattered showers, and showers and thunderstorms were
scattered ahead of the front over southeastern Wyoming and western
Nebraska.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT no rain amounts of an inch
or more were reported.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Mullan, Idaho, to 101 at Needles, Calif. Wednesday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 27 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from south-central and eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast into
Florida. Showers and thunderstorms also were forecast from
north-central Texas across Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, the middle and
upper Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms were forecast over eastern New England.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted from northwestern Montana across
the Pacific Northwest to along the California coast; in the 80s
from northern New England to the northern and central Appalachians,
from the northern half of the upper Great Lakes across much of the
middle Mississippi Valley into eastern Kansas, and from Montana
into the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah; above 100 over the
desert Southwest, inland valleys of southern California, and near
the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in Texas; and in the 90s over much
of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Members of the Newspaper Guild at The
Washington Post on Wednesday overwhelmingly ratified a new contract
that will raise salaries at the newspaper by about $165 per week
over the next five years.
   In addition to the salary hike, the new contract includes
improvements in guild representation for the paper's 1,420 union
members, according to Lewis Diuguid, a member of the bargaining
committee. The contract was tentatively approved last Friday after
all-night negotiations.
   In addition to newsroom workers, employees in the paper's
accounting, advertising, circulation and data-processing
departments are covered by the agreement.
   The contract is the first between the paper and the guild in
nearly three years. The previous pact expired in 1986, and
newspaper officials declared that negotiations had reached an
impasse a year later.
   To protest the slow pace in the contract talks, many Post
reporters removed their bylines from stories on the two
anniversaries of the breakdown in discussions.
   The new contract raises salaries between 4 percent and 6 percent
a year, with lower-paid workers receiving a higher percentage
increase along with improvements in minimum salary scales.
   The average salary for Post reporters is more than $52,000 per
year.

   Divers on Wednesday found the bodies of three
men aboard a drilling rig that capsized while fleeing Hurricane
Chantal, and the search continued for seven missing crewmen,
officials said.
   The search of the floating rig, which overturned Monday, was
delayed earlier in the day by strong currents and high seas.
   The bodies were recovered from the vessel's crew quarters, said
Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa.
   Coast Guard officials earlier speculated that crewmen may have
survived the accident if they were trapped in the watertight crew
quarters, but did not estimate how long the men could live on a
limited amount of air.
   Lifa said he didn't know what condition the crew quarters were
in.
   The names of the dead were being withheld pending notification
of their families, Lifa said.
   The search had to be abandoned Monday because of high seas and
strong wind stirred up by Chantal. Chevron, which had leased the
rig and hired the rescue divers, and the Coast Guard sent vessels
to resume the search Tuesday after Chantal blew ashore in Texas and
weakened to a tropical depression.
   There were conflicting reports about where the missing men were
last seen _ in the water or in the watertight crew's quarters
submerged in about 30 feet of water _ said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Glenn LaMont in New Orleans.
   The technical name for the rig is a lift boat. It has
retractable legs that anchor it to the sea bottom when in use, and
raise out of the way to allow the rig to be floated to a new
location.
   The legs were retracted and it was headed to shore early Monday,
trying to avoid Chantal, when it capsized.
   Three survivors were taken aboard a fishing vessel Monday and a
fourth was rescued by helicopter.

   Several angry relatives of victims lost in the
downing of Pan Am Flight 103 renewed their demand for a
wide-ranging congressional investigation Wednesday, saying their
pleas for more information have been virtually ignored.
   ``It is now four months since we met with President Bush and all
100 senators to request an investigation of the weak security and
the failure to act on high-level warnings issued to the FAA, the
State Department and the airline'' before the Dec. 21 incident,
said Paul Hudson, father of Melina Hudson, one of the victims.
   ``We are surprised and disappointed that the Bush administration
has adamantly opposed a congressional investigation or the
appointment of a special commission at every turn,'' Hudson told a
news conference.
   ``We also cannot understand why Congress has delayed taking any
action on their commitment to conduct a full-scale investigation of
this, the worst act of terrorism against civilians in our
history,'' he said.
   Investigators believe a mid-flight explosion downed the jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, including 189 Americans.
   Bush told the relatives earlier this year he had asked
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to work with them on a
review of airline security procedures.
   But in his statement Wednesday Hudson asked, ``Is it fear of
what might be disclosed as to the culpability of our allies, or is
this another example of non-action in the war against terrorism by
the U.S. government?''
   Rosemary Wolfe, stepmother of Pan Am victim Miriam Wolfe, said,
``We need an investigation now and urge the 60 to 70 senators and
many members of the House, who have told us they support an
investigation, to pass legislation now.''

   A leading Chinese intellectual, believed to be
a key link between deposed Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and
the crushed student movement, has escaped to the West, an activist
said Wednesday.
   Chen Yizi fled China to France several weeks ago on an
``underground railroad,'' the Hong Kong activist said. Chen, about
50, was director of the Institute of Restructuring the Economy, an
influential think tank when Zhao was in power.
   While in Paris, Chen participated in meetings to form an
overseas organization to push for democracy in China, said the
activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chen did not meet journalists, nor were reporters informed of
his presence in Paris. Indeed, some Western reports said he had
been arrested in Beijing.
   The Hong Kong activist, who insisted on anonymity, said Chen
remained in the West but declined to reveal his whereabouts. There
was no way to confirm the report by the activist, but he has been
reliable in the past.
   Several weeks ago, an official at Chen's institute said he was
``resting.''
   So far, the activist said, about 30 people have fled China via
the ``railroad.'' Among them have been essayist Yan Jiaqi and
student leader Wu'er Kaixi, both of whom were in Paris with Chen.
They since have gone to the United States. Others such as Marxist
scholar Su Shaozhi fled China by other means.
   A Western diplomat in Hong Kong has said Beijing authorities
apparently wanted to use Chen to prove that Zhao had direct ties to
the student movement. His escape would complicate those efforts,
the activist said.
   Chen apparently met with student leaders during their two-month
movement for sweeping political change in China.
   In a speech July 6, Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong criticized Chen by
name for presiding at a May 19 meeting during which pariticipants
urged ``publicizing the inside story of the decision-making of the
top leadership.''
   On May 20, martial law was declared in Beijing. The movement was
crushed on June 3 and 4 when thousands of Chinese soldiers entered
the capital and killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed city
residents and students.
   The Western diplomat said Chinese authorities wanted to prove
Chen conducted the meetings at the behest of Bao Tong, Zhao's
former right-hand man.
   Bao, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
and director of the Research Center for Reform of the Political
Structure, another pro-Zhao think-tank, was placed under house
arrest shortly after the crackdown.
   If the link between Bao and Chen could be established, communist
authorities would be able to implicate Zhao directly in the student
movement, the Western diplomat said.
   So far, the charges against Zhao have been relatively vague.
   The former chief of the Communist Party, Zhao was officially
purged after the June 4 crackdown and accused of supporting the
movement and ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.'' More recently, the
state-run media have accused him being responsible for high prices
and widespread corruption.
   Zhao's real involvement in the student movement is unclear.
   His sympathy for the movement was obvious when he went to
Tiananmen Square in mid-May and, with tears in his eyes, told the
students that he had come to see them too late.
   The movement was supported by many intellectuals like Chen Yizhi
and Yan Jiaqi who worked in think-tanks tied to Zhao. But it is
unknown whether they were functioning under Zhao's orders or acting
on their own.
   The Hong Kong activist said he looked on Chen's escape as a
major victory against the current crackdown on the movement.
Thousands of students and other participants in the campaign for
freedom have been arrested since the repression began in early June.
   The official media, which started out reporting every major new
arrest with headlines, have stopped highlighting such activity. The
apparent arrest of student leader Wang Dan received no mention in
the Chinese press.

   Writers in Czechoslovakia said Wednesday
the PEN branch was being allowed to reopen and Vaclav Havel would
be on the board, but reports from Prague said police had detained
the prominent, banned playwright.
   Ivan Klima, a dissident writer, said in Prague about 20
colleagues gathered on Tuesday and elected a new PEN governing
board. Klima said both he and Havel were on the panel, which also
included authors sanctioned by Czechoslovia's strict communist
regime.
   Klima was banned after a Soviet-led invasion crushed the 1968
``Prague spring'' of reforms. The Czech branch of the international
writers' club became dormant around 1971 after purges of Communist
Party members, including many writers.
   Dissident sources and a West German Embassy spokesman in Prague
said Havel was detained Wednesday while on his way to the embassy
for lunch with Ambassador Hermann Huber.
   It was the second day in a row Havel was picked up. Police
detained him for about three hours Tuesday.
   Sources in Prague said by telephone they did not know whether
Havel was released later Wednesday.
   In Bonn, West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Otto Lampe said
his government considered the detention an ``extremely serious''
incident and had lodged a formal protest.
   Havel was sentenced to eight months in jail earlier this year,
but released on parole about midway through the term after domestic
and foreign protests.
   On Tuesday, Klima said, police freed Havel in time for him to
appear at the end of the meeting.
   He said police summoned two members of the human rights group
Charter 77, Eva Kanturkova and Milan Simecka, for questioning at
the same time as the meeting, so they were unable to attend.
   CTK, the official Czechoslovak news agency, reported the PEN
reorganization briefly.
   Klima said the 10 members of the new board included six
dissident or nonconformist writers and four who were officially
sanctioned. CTK did not mentioned the board's makeup.
   Jiri Mucha, an official writers, was elected board chairman in
what Klima described as a compromise.
   Reviving the PEN chapter is the first joint official-dissident
literary venture in almost 20 years. Klima said he hoped the club
could negotiate with authorities on publishing forbidden books and
lifting bans on writers.
   Authorities have made small moves in the past year toward
artistic liberalization. Books by Franz Kafka have appeared for
only the second time since the ``Prague spring'' and bans were
removed from several movies, plays and rock bands.
   Officials say Havel and some other writers have remained under
prohibition because of their refusal to renounce political
activities.
   In May, the 60-chapter international PEN association voted
unanmously to admit a Soviet chapter, ending a long quarrel with
Moscow.
   Soviet participation in the 10,000-member group has been an
issue since PEN turned down an application in 1924.
   PEN champions freedom of expression for writers and had stayed
out of the Soviet Union because of its persecution of writers and
other intellectuals. The change of heart came after Mikhail S.
Gorbachev introduced more liberal policies.

   Thousands of firefighters struggled
Wednesday to contain forest fires that killed two tourists in
Corsica, forced the evacuation of thousands of people and destroyed
dozens of homes on the French Riviera.
   The fires threatened some of the most popular vacation areas in
southern France.
   Flames shot up near the village of Bormes-Les-Mimosas, west of
Toulon, forcing evacuation of a camping site. Firefighters used
planes to dump water on that blaze.
   The Interior Ministry said the fires, fanned by the region's
usually strong winds, have devastated about 50,000 acres of forest
and brush land.
   It said the winds had combined with drought to make the work of
firefighters ``very difficult.'' The firefighters had been trying
to stop advancing flames for three days, but the ministry said new
fires were breaking out in many places.
   Two Italian tourists were killed Monday when they drove their
car into a wall of fire in northern Corsica, an island off the
French coast, officials said.
   Nearly 25,000 acres have burned there, the ministry said. Other
fires were spreading along the coast of southern France, especially
around Marseille and Toulon.
   More than 4,000 people were evacuated northwest of Marseille and
about 50 homes and cottages were destroyed.
   Fires also destroyed 62 miles of telephone cable and 1,000
poles, and up to 4,000 homes were without service, the telephone
company said.
   Electricity of France said thousands of electric lines were cut
Tuesday and Wednesday at an estimated damage of up to $795,000.
   Several people were detained for questioning in the
Bouches-du-Rhone region around Marseille as authorities tried to
determine if arson played a role in the more than 100 separate
fires.
   In Corsica, shepherds are widely suspected of setting fires to
open land and improve next year's grazing.
   In Sardinia, hundreds of firefighters aided by helicopters and
aircraft battled wind-whipped brush fires that have killed four
people. The fires have burned more than 2,500 acres of land in the
island's Sassari Province.
   An Italian woman airlifted to a Rome hospital died Wednesday.
Another woman evacuated to the hospital Tuesday was reported in
critical condition.
   Three others have died since the fires began Tuesday.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Says Lucas Lost Because He Failed ``Litmus Test''</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: INSERTS one graf after 17th graf pvs, But presidential, to show

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Wednesday that William Lucas didn't win Senate Judiciary Committee
approval to be civil rights chief because he failed a ``litmus
test'' on discrimination issues.
   The attorney general said he discounted the significance of
criticism by several Democrats that Lucas lacked expertise for the
job, saying the Detroit Republican lost Tuesday's vote because he
refused to criticize recent Supreme Court decisions on civil rights.
   ``That was the reason expressed by one of the members of the
Judiciary Committe on the Democratic side,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``His reason for not supporting Mr. Lucas was that Mr. Lucas
supported the recent Supreme Court decisions on civil rights,'' the
attorney general said in an apparent reference to Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill.
   Civil rights lawyers have bemoaned the court decisions they say
will make it harder for discrimination victims to win bias suits in
court.
   Thornburgh said ``Mr. Lucas supported the views of the president
and the attorney general in this regard'' when he testified that no
legislation was needed at this time to overturn the rulings.
   ``I find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the
president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an
important area of the law,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``The fact that they have laid down as a litmus test that the
prospective nominee must refuse to support Supreme Court decisions
will make it difficult for us to walk the fine line that that view
implies,'' the attorney general said.
   Before Tuesday's vote, Simon cited Lucas' support of the high
court rulings during confirmation hearings as his reason for voting
against the nomination.
   But other Democrats said Lucas' lack of legal experience and
knowledge of civil rights laws was the basis for their votes
against the nomination.
   Simon said Lucas' views on the Supreme Court rulings ``are not
the test. But his answers were a symptom.''
   ``Bill Lucas is a fine person,'' Simon said, ``but the chief
civil rights enforcement officer of the land must have a firm grasp
of the laws he oversees and a firm commitment to vigorously enforce
those laws.''
   Lucas, 61, a former sheriff and chief executive of Wayne County,
Mich., has never tried a court case. The panel refused Tuesday on a
pair of 7-7 votes to recommend Lucas' nomination or send it to the
Senate floor for further consideration.
   The votes virtually killed Lucas' chances for Senate
confirmation but Thornburgh said the Justice Department was
considering the option of giving Lucas a so-called recess
appointment after Congress goes out of session Friday.
   ``I think we are going to look at every option and consult with
the White House,'' the attorney general told reporters after
testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Congressional and White House sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say it is unlikely that President Bush would antagonize
the Senate by appointing Lucas to the job while Congress takes its
summer recess. Such an interim appointment would be in effect until
Congress' adjournment in 1990.
   But presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we are still
assessing our options.''
   An official said the administration is also considering whether
to name Lucas to another post that does not require Senate approval.
   Thornburgh said the Justice Department still has a pool of
applicants for the job of assistant attorney general for civil
rights from which Lucas' name was selected.
   ``Those will be re-evaluated in the light of his failure to get
a vote on the Senate floor,'' Thornburgh said.
   The threat of a recess appointment could backfire. Under Senate
rules, all nominations awaiting confirmation are sent back to the
White House when Congress goes into recess.
   The Senate, however, traditionally waives this rule by unanimous
consent of its members when the White House pledges not to make
recess appointments.
   Without such a promise, the Senate could send all 123 of Bush's
nominations now pending on Capitol Hill back to the White House and
begin confirmation proceedings anew in September.

   A Piedmont Airlines jet dragged its left
wing and engine down a runway during an emergency landing Wednesday
after part of its landing gear jammed, but none of the 100 people
aboard was injured.
   ``I've had worse landings on regular flights,'' said passenger
Tammy Rudd, 26, of Washington, D.C.
   The left landing gear could not be lowered because of a wheel
chock that had lodged in the landing gear bay, said National
Transportation Safety Board investigator Phillip Powell.
   He said he did not know how or when the rubber chock, which is
used to hold planes in place on the ground, might have been wedged
there. A Piedmont spokesman said wheel chocks are supposed to be
left on the ground.
   ABC News reported that investigators believe mechanics at
Washington National Airport might have accidentally left the chock
in the plane's landing gear well.
   Passengers praised the crew and the pilot, whom Piedmont refused
to identify.
   ``It was kind of like a roller-coaster, kind of fun,'' said Army
Sgt. Debbie McDorman of Washington, D.C. She said the passengers
were calm and the landing ``was just as smooth as if he was on
wheels.''
   The Boeing 737-400 carried 94 passengers and six crew, including
the pilot, said Piedmont spokesman David Shipley. Piedmont took
delivery of the jetliner in December 1988 and has had no problems
with it or with the 737-400 fleet in general, Shipley said.
   The plane was bound for Charlotte from Washington National
Airport, but was diverted to Greensboro, where Piedmont has a
maintenance hangar, after a cockpit light showed the landing gear
wasn't locked, Shipley said.
   The pilot ``circled for better than an hour in an attempt to get
all the gear down,'' said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Roger Myers. The pilot got the nose wheel and right landing gear
down, but not the left gear, Myers said.
   During maneuvers to shake loose the landing gear and use up
fuel, the jetliner did a touch-and-go on one wheel _ contacting the
runway before immediately taking off again.
   Finally, the plane was eased down to the ground near the
beginning of the 10,000-foot runway. After the right main landing
gear touched down, the left wing tilted slowly toward the ground,
tapping it twice before the wing and its engine assembly dragged
the runway.
   Emergency vehicles lined the runway after the airport was closed
to other traffic.
   There was a brief flash of flame and smoke, apparently from a
tire, and the plane slid in a straight line, coming to rest about a
third of the way down the runway.
   Passengers slid down emergency chutes. Emergency crews sprayed
foam on the wing and engine.
   Carolyn Long said she was moved from her seat, which was located
on an emergency exit so that someone stronger could handle the door
once the plane landed.
   ``They had prepared us with this brace procedure,'' Mrs. Long
said, crossing her arms over her head to demonstrate the
instructions. ``I braced and braced.''
   Some passengers were still shaking and soaked in sweat after
they were bused to the terminal from the runway.
   Alfred Roscoe, also of Washington, D.C., had but one comment
when he emerged from the plane: ``Thank God.''
   He said the pilot ``did a very beautiful job.''
   ``I went to the pilot when we got off'' and flashed him a
thumbs-up sign, said passenger Richard Kochan.
   Kochan said the pilot looked at him, then pointed to the sky.
   ``I think the crew deserves a tremendous amount of praise,''
said Piedmont spokeswoman Susan Young. ``It shows a tremendous
amount of professionalism.'' She said the pilot had flown 20 years
for Piedmont.
   Boeing, which delivered the plane to Piedmont on Nov. 14, 1988,
will not send a crash investigation team, said spokesman Tom Cole
in Seattle.
   On Saturday, the Piedmont name will disappear and all planes
will bear USAir markings. Piedmont and USAir have been subsidiaries
of USAir Group for two years.

<HEAD>Richardson to File $35 Million Suit For Being Jailed in Family Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arcadia fruit picker who spent more than
21 years in prison for the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven
children is filing a $35 million lawsuit for being wrongly
convicted, his attorneys said Wednesday.
   James Richardson was freed last April after a state
investigation ordered by Gov. Bob Martinez found that suppressed
evidence and perjured testimony was used to convict the 53-year-old
farm worker.
   Richardson stood trial only for the slaying of his oldest child
and was sentenced to die in the electric chair. The sentence was
commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down
the death penalty in 1972.
   Attorneys in Sarasota were to file Richardson's suit Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Tampa.
   The lawsuit names the state of Florida, DeSoto County, former
State Attorney Frank Schaub and former DeSoto Sheriff Frank Cline.
The 22-page complaint includes five separate counts of
constitutional and civil rights violations and racketeering
activities on the part of Schaub and Cline.
   Roger Young, one of Richardson's attorneys, conceded it was
difficult placing a dollar amount on the time Richardson spent in
prison.
   ``It's hard. You can't really do it,'' Young said. ``He was
without his family, loss of liberty and everything that's
guaranteed to him by the constitution. Those things were all
stripped from him because of the actions of Frank Schaub.''
   The suit charges Schaub and Cline furthered a conspiracy to
convict Richardson at all costs.
   ``They manufactured evidence, witnesses were threatened and they
knowingly used perjured testimony to convict Richardson,'' Young
said.
   Schaub, who retired in January, prosecuted the case in 1968 and
blasted Special Prosecutor Janet Reno for concluding that
Richardson probably was wrongfully accused. Ms. Reno announced in
May that the state would not retry Richardson, whose sentence was
vacated April 25.
   Neither Schaub nor Cline were immediately available for comment.
   The suit seeks to compensate Richardson for mental anguish, loss
of the capacity for the enjoyment of life, loss of income, pain and
suffering and loss of his liberty and rights as a citizen of the
United States.
   Since his release from a state prison near Daytona Beach,
Richardson has worked at a diet clinic run by former comedian Dick
Gregory in Fort Walton Beach. Richardson was expected to comment on
the suit at a news conference scheduled for Thursday in Sarasota.
   Richardson was initially jailed on charges of poisoning his
seven children to collect insurance money. Six of the children,
ages 2 to 8, died Oct. 25, 1967, after eating a pesticide-laced
lunch. The seventh child died the next day.
   Richardson and his wife, Annie Mae, were out in the orange
groves at the time.
   The suit said Schaub and Cline continued to pursue the insurance
motive, even though the evidence showed that there had never been
an insurance policy taken out.
   Cline also suppressed all evidence implicating Bessie Reese, a
baby sitter who served the fatal lunch to the children, the suit
charges. In recent years, Ms. Reese confessed to the killings, but
that confession was thrown out because she was ruled mentally
incompetent.
   ``Sheriff Frank Cline manipulated the evidence to exonerate a
murderer and Frank Schaub conspired with him to do so from the
beginning of the investigation and continues to do so to this
day,'' according to the suit.
   Ms. Reno, the Dade County state attorney appointed by the
governor to investigate the allegations, found evidence of trial
errors and called the murder investigation ``totally inadequate and
incomplete.''

   An emotionally divided House on Wednesday
rejected an effort to tighten abortion restrictions in the District
of Columbia, the first congressional test on the subject since a
Supreme Court ruling last month permitting states to impose new
limits.
   On a surprising 219-206 vote that evoked hugs and hoots of cheer
on the House floor by supporters of the right to abortion, the
lawmakers rejected a proposal that would have banned all government
spending on abortions in the capital.
   The vote was a reversal of House sentiment last year, when the
legislators voted 222-186 to ban public spending on the procedures.
Abortion activists said it was the first time since 1980 the House
had refused to restrict government spending for abortion.
   The defeated provision, an amendment to a spending bill for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that forms Washington's municipal
budget, was proposed by Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif. The
prohibition would have included cases in which the mother's life is
in danger or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.
   The House recessed for the day and left the vote on final
passage of the overall bill for Thursday. That left anti-abortion
lawmakers one more chance to find votes and try to salvage their
proposal, perhaps by defeating the entire spending measure.
   Defeat of the amendment left intact abortion provisions in the
bill which are more liberal than current law. The bill would allow
the district to spend its own funds for abortions and to use
federal funds if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest or
if the mother's life was in danger. Current law, which expires
Sept. 30, contains a ban on spending either federal or district
funds unless the mother's life is threatened.
   Quoting the hospitalized Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., one of the
House's foremost abortion opponents, Dornan said, ``This is not
government intervention. The government's first duty is to protect
the weak from the strong.''
   Dornan and his supporters said they preferred to include an
exception for mothers whose lives are threatened, but did not
because it would have left their amendment vulnerable to being
struck down for procedural reasons.
   Opponents to Dornan's language warned that the roll call would
supply a hit list of lawmakers for voters who support the freedom
to choose abortions.
   ``All across the country, a newly energized pro-choice movement
is going to say to supporters of amendments like this, `If you are
anti-choice, when we the voters go to the ballot box, we won't
choose you,''' Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said before the vote.
   Jubilant pro-choice lawmakers readily conceded that they had not
expected to win, but attributed the surprise victory to a new alarm
among voters triggered by the Supreme Court's recent decision
restricting women's constitutional right to abortion.
   After the vote, AuCoin said: ``It was clear to members that this
is an issue on which they're going to be held accountable. This
vote was a dramatic turn, and it clearly reflects what's happening
in the country. It's a sea change.''
   The court's decision ``was really a wake-up call'' to abortion
defenders, said Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo. House members ``must be
starting to hear from people back home.''
   ``This is a barometer,'' said Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. ``The
winds are blowing, and they're blowing in our direction.''
   Dornan blamed his defeat on the new attention the Supreme Court
ruling has brought to abortion, the election of several freshmen
who favor liberalized abortion laws, and a reluctance by some
lawmakers to vote for a measure containing no exception for
endangered mothers.
   He noted that earlier Thursday the House had overwhelmingly
approved a separate spending bill that barred the Department of
Health and Human Services from providing any funds for abortions,
except for instances when the woman's life is at stake.
   ``I'm not worried about losing anything else,'' he said.
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority
and a former president of the National Organization for Women, was
elated.
   ``We're on a roll. Thirty-three votes switched since 1980. ...
We've marched in the streets, surged in the polls and challenged
both parties,'' Ms. Smeal said.
   On July 3, the Supreme Court gave states greater powers to
restrict abortions, allowing them to ban public employees or
facilities from participating in abortions, even when patients are
willing to pay for them.

   The Senate on Wednesday approved a $295
billion defense bill that leaves President Bush's strategic
programs such as Star Wars and the B-2 bomber relatively intact,
but backs an aircraft Bush sought to kill.
   ``The basic goals of the president was met,'' said Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, prior to final passage of the legislation.
   By a vote of 95-4, the Senate approved its version of the
defense authorization bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ a
blueprint that bears no resemblance to House legislation that
gutted or severely cut the president's big-ticket weapons systems.
   The Senate bill endorses the president's two mobile-missile
plan, including the request of $1.1 billion for the MX
rail-garrison and $100 million for the Midgetman.
   The legislation also makes a modest cut of $400 million in the
$4.9 billion request for Star Wars and trims $300 million from the
$4.7 billion proposal for the B-2 stealth bomber.
   The Senate backed the costly bomber, priced at $530 million a
copy, if it meets flight test and radar-evasion standards, and
accepted Bush's decision to cancel the F-14D Tomcat jet fighter.
   But the chamber diverged from the president on the Marine Corps'
V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor assault transport that takes off like a
helicopter but can fly like a plane. The Senate approved $255
million in research and development for the Bell-Boeing aircraft.
   The House and Senate meet in conference in early September to
complete a final version of the two defense blueprints the chambers
have crafted. The final product will include $295 billion for the
Defense Department, plus $10 billion for the Department of Energy.
   ``We have more profound differences this year than we've had in
a long, long time,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We face a difficult conference
with the House on this bill.''
   The money still has to be dispersed through appropriations bills.
   Last week, the House slashed $1.8 billion from the Star Wars
request, limited production of the B-2 bomber to two planes next
year and two the year after that _ half what the administration
sought, required the Pentagon to come up with a program cheaper
than $70 billion for the planned 132 planes and cut $502 million
from the MX missile.
   The House also eliminated all $100 million for the Midgetman and
restored the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D jet fighter, the two planes
Bush proposed canceling.
   Overwhelming Senate approval of the bill was not without some
dissent.
   ``Our motto ought to be: In Bombs We Trust. That's our national
ethic _ that is the example we are setting _ here on this floor,''
said Sen. Mark Hatfield, the Oregon Republican who entered Congress
during the Vietnam War and was one of the first serviceman on the
scene after the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.
   Voting against were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Hatfield. Sen. Donald
Riegle, D-Mich., did not vote.
   In other developments on the bill, which kept lawmakers will
past midnight on Wednesday and then throughout the day, senators:
   _Approved by voice vote a non-binding resolution urging Bush to
continue development of the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, the
tilt-rotor aircraft the administration sought to cancel. The
defense bill includes $255 million for research and development of
the Bell-Boeing V-22, which takes off like a helicopter but can fly
like a plane.
   _By voice vote, the Senate approved an amendment by Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., requiring graduates of the nation's military
academies to serve six years of service after graduation rather
than the eight years the bill would have required. The current
requirement is five years. Lott argued that the eight-year
requirement would drive applicants away from the academies.
   The effort to table the amendment failed 55-45 prior to the
voice vote. There is no comparable provision in the House version
of the bill.
   _Accepted by voice vote a non-binding resolution instructing the
CIA and Defense Department to report by Sept. 1 on how best to
locate and rescue American hostages in Lebanon. The report must
detail how additional money and agents can be used to find the
hostages and win their release.
   _Voted 53-44 against a plan to spend $100 million for the
effective deployment of 100 ground-based interceptor missiles in
Grand Forks, N.D., by 1995. The interceptors, part of the
Accidental Launch Protection System, would have been used against
sudden terrorist missile attacks.
   _Approved a series of ``burden-sharing'' amendments aimed at
increasing the contributions to defense by U.S. allies in Europe
and Asia.
   _Declined to vote on a proposal to restore former Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North's $23,000 pension. North has been convicted on
three felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair, and the Senate
ordered its Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the subject of
his pension.
   The defense bill legislation contains $200 million for
anti-satellite weapons in addition to unspecified amounts in the
Star Wars budget.
   Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and James Jeffords, R-Vt., had
proposed restrictions to bar such tests unless the administration
could certify that the Soviets had engaged in tests of their own,
had refused to bargain in good faith in limitations and had blocked
international verification efforts.
   The efforts to block attempts to chip away at Bush's defense
package were evident earlier this morning when the Senate avoided a
vote on an amendment transferring $450 million from the
administration's $4.9 billion request for the Star Wars
anti-missile shield to the war on drugs.
   Instead, the Senate approved a compromise drafted by Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that would
shift unspent balances in federal programs left over at the end of
the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 to the anti-drug effort.
   The measure exempts entitlement programs, including Social
Security, Medicare, and subsidized housing. But all other
government programs and agencies, including the Defense Department,
would be compelled to contribute.
   The Senate has sought to avoid following the House lead in
gutting or severely cutting back Bush's strategic programs. Last
week the House voted to cut $1.8 billion from Star Wars, impose
strict limitations on the B-2 stealth bomber, slash $502 million
from the $1.1 billion request for the MX nuclear missile and
eliminate all $100 million for the Midgetman missile.
   The House and Senate meet in conference in early September to
complete a final version of the two defense blueprints the chambers
have crafted.

   Security agents detained opposition
leader Kim Dae-jung on Wednesday and released him 22 hours later
after questioning on whether he was involved in a lawmaker's secret
trip to North Korea.
   Following his release Thursday, Kim told a news conference that
he was cleared of any suspicion.
   Clashes occurred Wednesday near the police station where he was
held when about 100 Kim supporters were stopped by hundreds of riot
police. Two of the protesters were injured.
   Investigators from the Agency for National Security Planning had
questioned Kim, head of the Party for Peace and Democracy, and
lawmaker Moon Dong-hwan after taking him from his party
headquarters to the downtown police station.
   Moon was also released, but there were no reports he spoke about
his investigation.
   Government officials said Kim was investigated to determine
whether he was involved in an unauthorized trip to North Korea by
Suh Kyung-won, a former party lawmaker jailed on charges of
espionage and security violations.
   The government prohibits any unofficial contacts with North
Korea.
   Kim, who ran twice for the presidency, has denied any
involvement in Suh's trip and charged the government with political
harassment.
   Suh was expelled from the party after his June 28 arrest on
charges of espionage for allegedly accepting $120,000 from
communist agents.
   Moon, the other lawmaker questioned, is a senior party member
and younger brother of Presbyterian minister Moon Ik-hwan, a
dissident clergyman who also defied the travel ban and visited
North Korea. The elder Moon is in jail.
   Hundreds of party members and supporters chanted Kim's name and
anti-government slogans when intelligence agents took Kim and Moon
away Wednesday.
   Shouting ``Disband the NSP!'' in reference to the national
security agency, they marched around their party headquarters and
briefly stopped the agents. The opposition leader smiled and waved
as he left in his car.
   Party spokesman Lee Sang-soo said that with Kim's detention, the
national security agency's ``scheme to suppress and destroy the
party has reached the extreme.''
   The intelligence agency earlier said it wanted to question Kim
about how Suh, a dissident farmer, joined the opposition party and
gained access to the opposition leader.
   At least 10 people have been jailed since Suh's arrest.
   In another development, North Korean news reports said a
visiting South Korean student has ended a five-day hunger strike
she staged after the U.N. Command guarding the border said they
would not let her return through the border village of Panmunjom.
   Im Su-kyong vowed to cross the border Aug. 15 in a demonstration
for unification and asked the South Korean government and the
U.S.-led U.N. Command to allow her safe passage.
   South Korean officials have said she will be arrested on her
return.
   ``I consider that the hunger strike ended in a great victory,''
the official Korean Central News Agency quoted Miss Im as saying.
``I will wage a struggle ... for my return home.''
   The U.N. Command has not blocked the student's return home, but
said they would consider an unauthorized crossing of the border a
violation of the armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean
War.
   Miss Im visited North Korea to attend the July 1-8 World
Festival of Youth and Students. She then joined a march from Mount
Paekdu, at the northern end of North Korea, to the border village.
   Korea was divided in 1945 after World War II. The 16-nation U.N.
Command fought on South Korea's side in the Korean War.

   The federal government is investigating
allegations that the Boeing Co. overcharged and double-billed the
Department of Defense millions of dollars for repairs of buildings
leased for secret military work.
   The investigation by two defense agencies, a congressional
panel, and reportedly, the Department of Justice's criminal
division, was sparked by a Boeing electrical engineer and
inspector, Kevin G. Kelly, who was fired Friday.
   But it has gone beyond his allegations, said an investigator for
a congressman looking into the case.
   The investigation appears to have started with Boeing's lease of
buildings under government contract from millionaire Seattle
developer David Sabey, according to an internal Boeing memorandum
obtained by The Associated Press.
   The buildings were built to Boeing's specifications by Sabey,
but Kelly says three buildings at one office park were substandard
and required $3 million in electrical and other repairs and
improvements, and that Boeing billed the government for the work,
rather than Sabey.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder confirmed Tuesday that an
investigation was underway and read a statement:
   ``Mr. Kelly noted some items that he concluded did not meet
building and electrical codes. The items he noted were thoroughly
investigated by Boeing and corrective actions were taken where
appropriate. Additionally, the buildings were inspected and
approved by the appropriate local government agencies.''
   Binder, Boeing's director of public relations, declined further
comment on the investigation and Kelly's firing.
   Sabey was unavailable, his secretary said. Sabey Corp. attorney
Don Berdick said the firm would have no comment.
   The leases with Sabey include buildings at two office parks used
by Boeing Advanced Systems for military work. The Boeing division
has defense contracts and subcontracts that range from work on the
B-2 stealth bomber to guided missile systems and avionic research.
   Kelly contends he was fired for alerting federal officials to
Boeing billing the Defense Department for the repairs at the Oxbow
office park.
   He says Boeing ignored his early warnings that electrical work
in the buildings was substandard. In a July 18 letter to Boeing
Chief Executive Officer Frank Shrontz, Kelly contended he was
``effectively quieted by Boeing management'' and ``I have not been
able to intelligently and satisfactorily discuss with supervisors
the substandard workmanship.''
   Shrontz's secretary said her boss would not comment.
   ``People in management have been covering up,'' Kelly asserted
Tuesday. ``Not one man in that whole group had the courage to stand
up and tell Sabey the buildings were substandard. Instead, they
said `let the taxpayer pay for it.'''
   Kelly said he has given investigators stacks of records over the
past year, some copies of which he gave to the AP when he learned
he was to be fired, including blueprints and other documents he
contended reveal substandard electrical work that ``clearly
violated not only Boeing's specifications of what they wanted in
the Oxbow buildings, but national and state electrical and building
codes.''
   The internal memo, from Boeing attorney S.W. Barclay to
department heads, describes the scope of a recent Defense
Department subpoena of company records. Most of the materials
subpoenaed, ranging from ``leasehold improvements, repair and
maintenance'' to internal company audits of leases, refer
specifically to the Sabey Corp. Barclay admonished officials to
destroy nothing that might relate to the subpoena.
   Investigations by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
and the Defense Contract Audit Agency began in mid-1988 with
allegations from Kelly.
   Kelly said the Justice Department also is investigating,
although Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Carter of Seattle declined
to confirm that, as a matter of policy.
   An investigator for Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said Dingell's
Energy and Commerce Committee also is looking into Kelly's
allegations. The staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said the Justice Department is investigating.
   Air Force Sgt. Michael Grinnell, spokesman in Washington for the
Air Force investigations office, said: ``I can confirm that we do
have an ongoing investigation concerning mischarging of facility
repair costs for leased buildings. By mischarging, we mean
overcharging, double-billing.''
   Kelly said that when Boeing went to repair some of the problems,
it had to ``fix some of them a second or third time. I'm told by
the AFOSI that the taxpayers pay for all of these repairs, not
Sabey.''
   Grinnell and Philip E. Rogers, a spokesman in Washington for the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, both declined to discuss Kelly's
specific allegations or other elements of their investigations.
   But Dingell's staff investigator said: ``From our standpoint,
the DCAA and the OSI appear to be making substantial progress. From
what they've told us, (Kelly's) allegations all appear to have
merit.''
   The agencies and the Justice Department, he said, ``are looking
at mischarging, overcharging, double-billing.''
   And he said that while Kelly was ``the catalyst'' for the
investigation, it has gone beyond his allegations.
   Kelly said he plans to sue under a federal statute that provides
whistleblowers a portion of settlements if the allegations are
proved.

<HEAD>Court Rules Rented Houses Can Be Destroyed, 13 Wounded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
the army can destroy the homes of Palestinians suspected of
anti-Israeli activities even if they are rented.
   The decision followed by just four days a Supreme Court ruling
that said the army must give Palestinians an opportunity to appeal
before destroying their homes.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, 13 Palestinians were
shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops, hospitals
reported.
   A Palestinian prisoner, Jihad Abdel Imadi, was seriously beaten
by fellow inmates at Israeli's Ketziot detention center in the
southern Negev desert, the army said. It said it was investigating
the circumstances of the incident.
   The Supreme Court ruling came in response to a case brought by
an Arab landlord in the West Bank town of Tulkarem, the independent
Itim news agency reported.
   The landlord, Ahmed Khalil Jumail, said he rented an apartment
to Mustafa Omar, who has been charged with throwing Molotov
cocktails at an army vehicle and at the house of a Palestinian
suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   Jumail said that even though he had no connection with Omar's
alleged activities, the Defense Ministry had ordered his property
destroyed.
   Meir Shamgar, the court president, ruled that if sanctions could
not be taken against rental property, it would ``negate all the
deterrent power that comes from the usage of the emergency defense
regulations,'' Itim said.
   He said, however, that Jumail's property should be sealed and
not destroyed.
   Israeli forces have blown up or torn down at least 225 houses in
the occupied territories since the start of the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule 19 months ago. At least 527
Palestinians and 38 Israelis have died in the uprising.
   The United States and international human rights groups have
called for an end to the practice, saying that it is carried out
without due process of the law. In many cases, property is
destroyed before the suspect is either charged or tried.

<TEXT>
   Pink scallops contaminated with a
potentially deadly, natural poison were shipped to restaurants
because of the time it took to process tests on the shellfish,
officials said Wednesday.
   Shellfish tested contained more than five times the level of the
poison permitted by state regulations, said state health department
spokesman Scott Lewis.
   All but 7 pounds of the 75 pounds of scallops in the shipment
from Washington state had been accounted for by late Wednesday,
according to state health officials.
   Officials were trying to determine whether diners had eaten any
of the scallops, said Ken August, another health department
spokesman. August said there had been no reports of poisonings, and
noted that the poison is relatively fast-acting.
   The distributor, Marinelli's Seafood Co., recovered 35 pounds of
the shipment, and advised four San Francisco-area restaurants that
received a total of 25 pounds to destroy the scallops, said
Marinelli's general manager Mike Mitchell.
   An additional 15 pounds were sent to a New York restaurateur,
who also was told to destroy the shellfish, Mitchell said.
   Another 75-pound shipment of scallops gathered from the same
area but at a different time was shipped to Los Angeles, but was
found to be uncontaminated, health officials said.
   All commercial shellfishing in northern Puget Sound was
suspended until Washington state can analyze the situation, said
Jack Lilja, shellfish program manager for that state's health
department.
   The pink scallop is a gourmet item typically sold only to
restaurants, although some markets occasionally carry it, Lewis
said.
   Health investigators identified the poison as saxitoxin, a
natural substance that does not harm shellfish but causes paralysis
and sometimes death in humans.
   The shipment from Rock Point Oysters Inc. of Bow, Wash., arrived
and was tested at San Francisco International Airport on Monday.
   Washington health inspectors routinely test scallops every two
weeks, but ``apparently this particular lot slipped through,'' said
Lilja.
   It takes 24 hours to process the California tests, and the
scallops were transferred to Marinelli's pending the results, Lewis
said. By the time the contamination was reported late Tuesday
afternoon, they had already been shipped.
   ``You're dealing with a live product,'' said Lewis. ``There are
economic factors at work, too.''
   Frank Nava, chief of field operations for the food and drug
branch of the California health department, could not say why
incoming shellfish are not held during the 24-hour processing
period.
   ``I don't have an answer for that, except that 99 percent of the
time they're OK, they're great,'' Nava said. ``It works fine.''
   Officials must balance public health considerations with the
danger of causing ``unnecessary panic,'' he said.
   California officials are reviewing their testing policies and
are waiting to see if Washington authorities change their
procedures, Nava said.
   Saxitoxin is a potent poison that can cause paralysis and even
death, according to the California health department. It is picked
up by shellfish feeding on a ``red tide'' made up of microorganisms.
   Cooking will not destroy the toxin and concentrations of about
1,000 micrograms per 3{-ounce serving have caused serious problems
for people, according to Olga Woo, a specialist with the Poison
Control Center at the University of California, San Francisco.
   The sample gathered Monday contained the equivalent of about 470
micrograms per 3{ ounces, Woo said.
   Bill Marinelli of Marinelli's Seafood disputed the warning that
the shellfish could be deadly. The toxin levels were ``not safe,
but by no means lethal,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fuel Spill Hits Beaches; Governor Demands Railroad Pay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diesel fuel spilled into Whitefish Lake
by a train derailment began washing up on beaches and shores near
this resort community Wednesday and residents complained that the
cleanup effort was halfhearted.
   Gov. Stan Stephens toured the site by helicopter and said
Burlington Northern Railroad would be held accountable for
``anything that's been adversely impacted that has a cost to it,''
as well as all cleanup costs.
   BN Vice President Bill Francis said the railroad would pay all
costs ``legally that we need to.''
   BN continued to pump diesel oil remaining in tanker cars that
landed in the lake, but said all leaks had been plugged by divers
and no more oil was spilling. The railroad estimated 10,000 gallons
had spilled since Monday's derailment.
   Twenty-nine cars of a 100-car train derailed Monday four miles
north of Whitefish in northwestern Montana, and several cars,
including the fuel-carrying tankers, went down a 100-foot
embankment into Whitefish Lake. No injuries were reported.
   Francis estimated the cost of the derailment alone at $557,000,
but said he has no estimate on cleanup costs.
   A helicopter survey Wednesday revealed that about half the
3,350-acre lake was covered with the telltale rainbow sheen of a
thin oil slick, and oil began washing ashore on the populated
southern and eastern banks.
   ``It's awful,'' said Dean Olafson, who lives on the eastern
shore. ``We've been mopping all morning and the winds changed and
now it's just come back in again.''
   Olafson complained that there had been too little response to
the spill.
   ``The way they react is just wrong,'' Olafson said. ``They're
always looking for the cheap way out, and it ends up being more
expensive.''
   The governor said he was ``deeply saddened'' by the sight,
noting he and his family have vacationed at the lake for years.
   The tank cars should be pulled out of the water sometime
Thursday, said Gus Melonas, BN's Montana spokesman.
   The derailment closed BN's main line from Minneapolis to
Seattle, forcing freight trains to be rerouted south, and Amtrak
had to bus passengers from its Empire Builder train around the
derailment area.

<HEAD>Congressman Questions U.S. Travel Advisories In Wake Of Kenya Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman Wednesday questioned how the
State Department issues travel advisories, saying a warning should
have been posted for Kenya before a Connecticut woman became the
latest tourist killed in a recent string of ambushes.
   ``While the State Department did respond the following day by
placing Kenya on the travel advisory list, I must seriously
question why this action was not taken earlier,'' Rep. John G.
Rowland, R-Conn., said in a letter to Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Three German tourists were wounded in an ambush in April, two
French tourists were killed by ivory poachers in early July and two
Americans were beaten while riding horseback last week, Rowland
said.
   ``It is my understanding that incidents such as the above weigh
heaviest in any decision to place a nation on the travel advisory
list,'' the congressman said. ``American citizens deserve to be
informed of any dangers they face as international travelers.''
   An advisory for Kenya was not issued until after Marie Ferraro,
50, of Bethany, Conn., was shot to death last Thursday by two
bandits armed with assault rifles who fired at a van carrying a
Connecticut Audubon Society wildlife tour group.
   ``My saddness and concern stem from this tragic loss of life and
the possibility that proper risk notification was not given,''
Rowland said.
   The congressman requested a detailed explanation of the
decision-making process for travel advisories and urged an
``in-depth review'' by the department of its procedures.
   A spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular
Affairs referred to a March press release that read in part,
``Travel advisories which describe a potential for violence and
physical danger usually reflect a trend or pattern of violence over
a period of time in which the government of the country involved is
unwilling or unable to afford normal protection.''

<HEAD>Student Expelled for Leading University Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese student who helped stage a
demonstration at Beijing University last month has been expelled
and refused his diploma, university officials said.
   A public announcement, posted on bulletin boards once festooned
with the posters of the student-led pro-democracy movement, said
Xiong Dayong, 22, had broken martial law regulations banning
unauthorized gatherings.
   The notice, dated July 25, said Xiong, a fourth-year student of
Chinese and a member of the Communist Party's Youth League, had
``incited other students to cause trouble by breaking martial law
restrictions.''
   It also accused Xiong of being a ``known criminal'' who had
stolen three bicycles this summer and caused a drunken brawl last
year.
   With no diploma and an expulsion on his record, Xiong will have
difficulty finding work.
   On July 23, from 300 to 400 students sang and beat pots and pans
to mourn classmates killed June 3-4 when troops opened fire on
student protesters and supporters.
   China has said 200-300 people died in the military assault, but
Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death
toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   The students said they held the July 23 demonstration because
they felt oppressed by the ideological study classes they were
forced to attend following the military crackdown. They were also
protesting because some of them were refused permission to join the
work units to which they were earlier assigned.
   Most college graduates in China are assigned jobs by the
government. Most of the 32,000 graduates from 80 universities and
colleges in Beijing this year have been accepted by their assigned
units, the official Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday.
   The report said more than 1,000 graduates, however, had not
found appropriate jobs, in part because some foreign companies,
party schools, judicial departments, travel agencies and the
military had dropped plans to accept more than 300 students.
   The report did not say whether the refusals were due to
political considerations arising from participation in the
pro-democracy demonstrations this spring, which were initiated and
led by students from Beijing universities.
   It quoted Han Xueping, head of the student department of the
Beijing Higher Education Bureau, as saying that all graduates in
Beijing had undergone three weeks of political study to review
their thought and actions during the student protests.

<HEAD>Justice Department Files Complaint To Strip Man Of Citizenship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department started proceedings
Wednesday to strip a former Akron, Ohio of his citizenship because
he failed to disclose that he was a Nazi concentration camp guard.
   A complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington
against Jakob F. Denzinger, who became a naturalized citizen in
Akron in 1972.
   Denzinger, 65, is believed to have left the country, the Justice
Department said in a prepared statement.
   The government alleged that Denzinger guarded prisoners at slave
labor sites, manned watchtowers and ``assisted in the persecution
of those interned.''
   According to the complaint, Denzinger was born in Yugoslavia,
entered the Waffen SS in 1941 and was an armed guard at several
concentration camps, including the Auschwitz death camp.
   To date, U.S. citizenship has been revoked from 30 World War
II-era criminals, including 27 who have been deported, said the
Office of Special Investigations, which builds the cases against
suspected Nazi persecutors.

<HEAD>Investigators Say HUD Program Consultant Fee Total Over $5.7 Million</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: SUBS 9th graf: ``The Senate,'' with approval of nomination by
the full Senate.</HEAD>

   Government investigators told Congress on
Wednesday they have uncovered an additional $1.2 million in
payments to well-connected consultants who helped their employers
win big HUD contracts on housing for the poor.
   Paul Adams, inspector general at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, said known consultant fees now total more than
$5.7 million for a single housing rehabilitation program. He said
about one-fifth of all low-income apartment rehabilitations were
snared by companies employing 20 consultants.
   The consultants include politically influential Republicans and
former agency officials.
   A Senate panel heard the testimony as a House subcommittee voted
6-0 to subpoena Lance Wilson to testify in September. Wilson, a
former executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce,
failed to appear voluntarily last week to discuss allegations of
abuse and mismanagement at the agency, saying his attorney was ill.
   Meanwhile, the HUD scandal spilled over onto the Senate floor.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell said the agency had been ``used
as a political slush fund where political appointees gave favors
... to politically well-connected individuals'' during the Reagan
administration.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole countered that the Democratic
majority was stalling efforts by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp to clean
up the department by delaying confirmation votes on several key
appointees.
   ``Let's make certain we understand that Congress hasn't been
very cooperative,'' Dole said. ``Now we've got a situation where
Secretary (Jack) Kemp is trying to do the right thing, and he
doesn't have anybody on board.''
   The Senate Banking Committee voted 17-0 Wednesday to recommend
approval of the nomination of C. Austin Fitts as Assistant
Secretary of Housing and it was approved by unanimous consent by
the full Senate late Wednesday.
   Adams' report to the Banking Committee included several familiar
names of consultants who received large fees.
   They included Joseph Strauss, a former HUD official who received
nearly $1.7 million in fees; former Interior Secretary James Watt,
who received $300,000; former HUD Secretary and current U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, who received $138,445, and Philip
Abrams, a former agency undersecretary who got $100,000.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said, ``In some of the earlier hearings
we identified the rats, now we're starting to identify the cheese
that attracted these rats.''
   Much of the profit that developers made from HUD programs were
derived from tax credits and rent subsidies for apartments in areas
where housing demand was weakening.
   The profits were used to pay millions of dollars in consultant
fees on projects in a handful of states that shouldn't have gotten
such projects because they had ``weak or very weak'' rental
markets, according to Adams and other analysts.
   ``Multiple benefits were awarded to eligible projects by
different administering agencies such as HUD, state tax credit
allocation agencies and local governments,'' said John M. Ols Jr.
director of housing and community development issues of the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   The GAO found developers received between $250,000 and $2.1
million above their purchase and renovation costs in its review of
eight projects in HUD's troubled moderate rehabilitation programs,
he said.
   ``This is the profit of the developer less any income taxes he
would have to pay,'' said Ols.
   Ols said excessive government rent subsidies for those projects
could amount to $25 million over the 15-year period of the HUD
rental subsidy contracts.
   In an update of his April audit of the moderate rehabilitation
program, HUD Inspector General Adams told the panel 20 consultants
were paid more than $5.7 million for lobbying for 51 projects.
   Those projects covered 7,268 rental units, or 20.3 percent of
the moderate rehabilitation funding available since 1983, Adams
said.
   In addition, Adams found many of the projects concentrated in
four states _ Colorado, Oklahoma, Nevada and Wyoming _ which
received more funds than they would have if they had been
distributed using the ``fair share'' formula that Congress had
waived.
   ``The bottom line is that the mod rehab program probably was not
needed in these states during that time period,'' said Adams.
   The rental markets at the time these projects were approved were
either ``weak or very weak'' said Morton J. Schussheim, a housing
specialist with the Congressional Research Service.
   Schussheim examined 20 projects funded by the mod rehab program
whose mortgages were originated by the Knoxville, Tenn.-based
Benton Mortgage Co. under the federal coinsured mortgage program.
   Schussheim told the committee he could not determine if
developers sought situations where properties could be bought at
comparatively low prices because the market was ``soft'' but said
it was a ``plausible hypothesis.''
   Ols said the soft markets provided developers opportunity to
convert available future tax credits on the projects to ready cash
by selling to investors through syndicators.

<UNK>Moldavians Protest Stalin-Hitler Pact</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people gathered in Kishinev, the
capital of Soviet Moldavia, Wednesday to condemn the Soviet
annexation of their homeland in a secret pact between Josef Stalin
and Adolf Hitler, an activist said.
   Yuri Rozhgo said from Kishinev that demonstrators demanded that
the Soviet government declare the August 1939 pact to be null.
   A Moscow legislative commission is thought to be within days of
declaring void the agreement that divided Eastern Europe before
World War II into Soviet and German spheres of influence. The
Kremlin had denied for years that any such pact existed.
   Activists in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia have pushed for such a decision for more than two years.
Rozhgo said Moldavia also came under Soviet control because of the
pact.
   Rozhgo, a member of the Moldavian People's Front, said that
between 2,000 and 3,000 people gathered in central Kishinev to mark
Wednesday's 49th anniversary of the Moldavian Soviet republic.
Soviet soldiers occupied the small republic bordering Romania on
June 28, 1940.
   Rozhgo said the People's Front was told that members of Vatra, a
group promoting Moldavian culture, were beaten by police when they
tried to gather in Bendery, southeast of Kishinev.
   Demonstrations have swept the republic this year as ethnic
Moldavians, who are closely related to Romanians, demand
restoration of the Latin alphabet and their native language. The
language was converted to Russian letters after the Soviet takeover.
   The republic's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, is to meet Aug.
28 to consider a law that would make Moldavian the official
language.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate passed a disaster assistance bill
Wednesday to send $885 million in relief to farmers hit by drought
and severe weather.
   The bill would make farmers eligible for federal aid if they
have crop losses this year because of drought, flooding, freezing,
hail, high winds or similar severe weather. The measure also
provides for payments to livestock producers facing drought-related
feed and water shortages for their herds.
   But the pricetag on the bill passed by voice vote in the Senate
is about $463 million less than the Agriculture Department has
estimated would be the cost of a packaged approved by the House.
   The Senate bill provides for different eligibility standards for
various crops, but in all cases producers would receive payments
designed to cover 65 percent of their lost income from crop losses.
   In most cases, the projected income levels will be based on
federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have
received had they not suffered losses.
   ``The most important thing about this bill is that all farmers
are being treated fairly,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
chairman of the Agriculture Committee. ``Those who suffer a
significant loss will receive the same payment rate _ 65 percent of
the applicable target price or loan rate.''
   ``We will not discriminate against any farmer who needs help,''
Leahy said. ``This legislation treats farmers fairly, whether they
grow wheat, corn, hay or soybeans.''
   Wheat and other crops have been damaged by the lingering drought
across much of the Great Plains and flooding has destroyed rice and
cotton in the South.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said winter wheat
producers and other growers will be eligible for high-priority
attention under provisions of the legislation.
   ``This is not the best bill, nor is it the kind of relief winter
wheat producers and other program crops deserve,'' he said. ``But
it is far better than the budget-busting House bill which promised
federal relief to every crop in America.''
   The House disaster relief bill required a minimum loss of 35
percent for any crop to receive assistance, with payments covering
65 percent of lost income. But unlike the Senate bill, the House
measure called for 90 percent payments on crop losses of more than
75 percent.
   The Senate dropped the higher payment level as a way of cutting
the overall cost of the assistance package.
   The Senate also passed by voice vote rural development
legislation designed to promote business investment and expansion
in small towns. It also is aimed at improving schools and health
care for residents.
   Proponents had said federal assistance was needed because the 61
million people living in rural areas face higher unemployment, more
hospital closings and higher poverty levels than their urban
counterparts. The rural economy also is more volatile because of
its dependence on natural resources, supporters contended.
   The centerpiece of the package, called the ``rural partnership
act,'' is a revolving loan fund program to provide $300 million in
seed money over five years for new and expanding businesses.
   The federal money, which must be matched by money from local
sources, would go for loans and loan guarantees to create new jobs.
The revolving loan funds would be operated by states, local
governor or economic development groupst to ensure local control of
the lending, according to supportrs.

<HEAD>Oil, Gas Industry Spar Over Effects On Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study paid for by oil interests concluded
Wednesday that natural gas heat might contribute more to the
``greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth than oil heat. The gas
industry immediately attacked the report as flawed and biased.
   The New England Fuel Institute, an oil industry group based in
Watertown, Mass., commissioned University of Minnesota Professor
Dean E. Abrahamson to compare the two fuels.
   Abrahamson, a physicist, is a public policy professor at the
university's Humbert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and
co-chairman of the school's Council of Environmental Quality. He
edited and was a co-author of ``The Challenge of Global Warming,''
a book sponsored by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group. He serves on the council's board of trustees.
   Ted Kinne, vice president at the Interstate Natural Gas
Association of America, an industry group representing pipeline
companies, said the study ``is clearly biased towards oil. It is
obvious who is paying for this study.''
   Abrahamson, at a news conference sponsored by the New England
Fuel Institute, defended the independence of his study.
   ``The Oil Task Force put absolute no constraints'' on the study,
he said.
   Scientists believe several gases allow warmth from the sun to
pass through to the earth's surface, but block outgoing radiation,
raising the planet's temperature in the same way a greenhouse stays
warm.
   The chief contributor, accounting for about half the predicted
future warming, is carbon dioxide, an inevitable product of
combustion of any carbon-containing fuel.
   Methane is another such gas, and natural gas is almost all
methane.
   For equivalent heat output, it has long been known that oil
produces about 40 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas.
   The study said global warming from natural gas heat would exceed
the global heating from oil heat if 1 percent to 2 percent of the
natural gas is lost.
   Abrahamson said he found that 0.13 percent of the gas is lost in
production and 0.54 percent is reported ``unaccounted for'' in
interstate transmission. Distribution companies report 1 percent to
6 percent ``unaccounted for,'' and that does not count any that
escapes after passing through the customer's meter.
   But the American Gas Association said the unaccounted for gas in
all utilities includes gas theft, meter inaccuracies and other
factors in addition to leaks.
   The gas association estimated that about 0.4 percent of the gas
is lost in leaks.
   Abrahamson said methane causes 30 to 70 times more greenhouse
heating than the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide, while gas
industry representatives said it caused only 10 percent to 30
percent as much.
   The Interstate Natural Gas Association criticized the study for
not taking into account the length of time the two gases will stay
in the atmosphere. Methane remains in the air for 10 years, while
carbon dioxide remains for 500 years, Kinne said.
   ``He assumes it is not worth considering. I think the effect is
very signficiant,'' Kinne said.
   Dennis Tirpak, an Environmental Protection Agency official who
has conducted studies of the greenhouse effect for the agency, said
methane was 20 times more effective, molecule for molecule, in
trapping radiation than was carbon dioxide, but its lifetime in the
atmosphere is also important _ eight to 11 years vs. 100 to 500
years.
   As to gas being a bigger contributor than oil if 1 per cent to 2
percent is lost, Tirpak said, ``I think you'd have to go higher
than than but I can't really say without having studied their
statements.''
   Methane concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at about
1 percent per year and no one has determined why, though there are
several theories. Some studies suggest that methane could be
responsible for 20 percent of recent greenhouse warming, if there
has been any, vs. about 50 percent for carbon dioxide.

<HEAD>Studio Visit Foretold Suspect's `Obsession,' Guard Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused of killing ``My Sister
Sam'' star Rebecca Schaeffer was once thrown out of the TV studio
where she was working after a guard noticed ``something haywire''
about him, the guard said.
   Robert John Bardo, 19, came to the studio lot two years ago with
a teddy bear and a bouquet, and begged to see the actress, said
John Egger, chief of security for The Burbank Studios.
   Egger said he took Bardo off the lot and drove him to the
run-down motel in Hollywood where the youth was staying. He said
Bardo promised to return home to Tucson, Ariz., and that Bardo
called him the next day to say he was about to board a bus going
there.
   ``I thought he was just lovesick, which I think he was,'' Egger,
62, said this week. ``He was terribly insistent on being let in.
`Rebecca Schaeffer' was every other word. `I gotta see her. I love
her. If I could just see her for a minute.'
   ``He seemed to be an intelligent kid, no raving lunatic, no
dumbbell, but something was definitely wrong, mentally,'' Egger
said. ``There was something haywire going on, but I didn't perceive
it as potentially violent.''
   Egger said Bardo initially made numerous phone calls to the
production office asking to speak to Miss Schaeffer.
   The incident provided another glimpse into what authorities call
Bardo's fatal obsession with the 21-year-old actress, who was shot
July 18 as she opened the door to her apartment building. Bardo was
arrested in Tucson the next day and charged in the slaying.
   Egger, a former Beverly Hills police captain, said he followed
standard procedure in informing Miss Schaeffer's production unit
about Bardo's attempt to see her in June 1987. But whether anyone
told Miss Schaeffer remained unclear Wednesday.
   ``So a fan tried to get on the lot. So what? Who's going to
think he's a potential murderer?'' asked Mimi Weber, vice president
of the production company for ``My Sister Sam.''
   ``It would have seemed harmless: another young kid who's
star-struck,'' she said. ``We have tons of those. Lots are lovable;
some are crazy. But who's to know?''
   People who were present remember hearing about a persistent fan

   An official of the government's
anti-corruption agency was arrested when he allegedly tried to
board a Miami-bound flight with 97 pounds of cocaine in his
luggage, police said Wednesday.
   Jose Fernando Minero Navas, 27, was arrested at the
international airport,
   National Police spokesman Guillermo Mollinedo said.
   The spokesman said Minero worked at the airport as an agent of
the Presidential Department of Administrative Control, which was
created by President Vinicio Cerezo's administration to fight
official corruption. The unit at the airport handled agencies like
customs and immigration.
   Mollinedo said Minero was arrested Tuesday after police became
suspicious of what appeared to be unusually heavy hand luggage. He
said police inspected the bag and found about 97 pounds of cocaine.
   Drug charges have been filed against Minero, he said.

   A Korean Air plane on Thursday flew
home the bodies of the 68 South Korean victims of last week's
airline crash in Libya.
   The coffins, flown from the Libyan capital of Tripoli, were
draped in South Korean flags and were taken to a government
hospital in Seoul.
   Officials said the bodies would not be returned to family
members until the completion of autopsys and identification.
   Airline officials said 73 of the 199 passengers and crew aboard
the Korean Air DC-10 that crashed July 27 were killed, including
one Japanese and four Libyan passengers. At least six people died
on the ground.
   Survivors returned to Seoul on Sunday.
   Passengers on the plane were mostly construction workers in
Libya and nearby countries.
   At Seoul's Kimpo airport, hundreds of friends and family members
of victims have refused to budge during negotiations with airline
officials on compensation.
   On Wednesday, about 20 angry relatives overturned desks and
shattered windows at an airport building after rejecting an
unspecified offer of compensation by the airline.
   Investigators were still trying to determine the cause of the
accident in which the plane crashed just short of fogbound Tripoli
airport.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury Wednesday indicted 46
traders at the world's two largest commodity exchanges on charges
ranging from tax fraud to racketeering for allegedly bilking
profits from hundreds of customers.
   The 2{-year federal investigation at the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange resulted in allegations that
traders systematically conspired with one another to skim profits
from customers' accounts, and often tried to hide the profits from
the Internal Revenue Service.
   Sixteen of the traders were charged with violating the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, which empowers
the government to freeze defendants' assets before a trial for
seizure upon conviction.
   The government increasingly has been using the law _ enacted to
fight organized crime such as drug trafficking _ to crack down on
securities crime and other white-collar corruption.
   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who attended the news
conference at which the indictments were announced, said the
charges were part of a ``crackdown on white-collar crime in all its
various guises, from Wall Street to LaSalle Street to Main Street
and all stops in between.''
   LaSalle Street is the heart of Chicago's financial district.
   ``The activity uncovered at these exchanges _ the largest of
their type in the world _ cannot be tolerated,'' Thornburgh said.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said traders broke the law and the
rules governing business at the exchange by arranging deals with
one another before and after the pits were open for trading.
   He said the alleged activity involved hundreds of customers and
thousands of trades. No dollar amount was given for the alleged
fraud but Valukas said it was ``significant.''
   Officials said the investigation was continuing and indicated
more indictments were possible.
   The charges, contained in four indictments totaling 375 pages,
included hundreds of counts against the 46 people named.
   Nineteen indictments were returned for activities in the soybean
pits and three in the U.S. Treasury bond pits at the Board of
Trade. At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 21 indictments were in
the Japanese yen pits and three each in Swiss franc pits.
   The government said directors of the Board of Trade and the
Mercantile Exchange were not involved in the illegal activity and
had cooperated in the investigation.
   ``The legitimate activities of these exchanges, involving
everything from grains to government bonds and foreign currencies,
impact upon farmers, consumers, businesses and governments,'' said
Thornburgh, who was joined by Valukas, FBI director William
Sessions and Wendy Gramm, head of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission at the news conference.
   ``I want to assure all parties that public confidence in the
honest functioning of the marketplace will be vigorously
protected,'' Thornburgh added.
   Sessions said the FBI used ``extraordinary means to detect
extraordinary fraud,'' training agents in the complicated world of
futures trading and sending them onto the exchange floors to mingle
with real traders.
   Valukas said the illegal schemes involved pre-arranged trades at
prices below what the traders' customers actually paid for a
commodity. The traders involved would then share the illegal
profit, he said.
   At the close of business, traders frequently agreed among
themselves to change prices on their cards to increase their
profits and correct bad deals, the prosecutor said.
   Valukas cited specific instances during the summer of 1988 _
when soybean prices were rising rapidly because of the drought _
where brokers routinely withheld orders from the market and then
gave them to favored traders, cheating the customer out of a fair
market price.
   ``What we are talking about here are hundreds of customers
involving thousands of trades for which fraud was perpetrated and
losses incurred by those customers because of this scheme,''
Valukas said.
   The FBI investigation, disclosed in January, also centered on
allegations that brokers sent false reports to customers to hide
the skimming of profits or overcharges on commissions.
   The Mercantile Exchange also reportedly is planning to bring its
own charges against four traders in connection with yen-pit trades
with one of the undercover FBI agent who posed as traders in the
federal investigation.
   Traders have been bargaining with authorities and the exchanges
to reduce the possible penalties against them.
   Futures are contracts to buy or sell, by a future date at a
specified price, commodities and financial instruments ranging from
soybeans and pork bellies to Treasury bonds and baskets of stocks.
   Futures traders can make and lose fortunes within minutes while
standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the pits and trading with each
other.
   Independent traders, called ``locals,'' trade for their own
accounts. Other traders, called brokers, trade on behalf of clients
of futures brokerages. Some brokers also trade for their own
accounts in an often-criticized practice called dual trading.
   The government won a key battle clearing the way for the
indictments on Friday when Chief U.S. District Judge John Grady
denied a Swiss franc trader's contention that the government's
secret taping of traders on the exchange floors had violated
federal electronic surveillance laws.

   A federal court jury Wednesday awarded $50
million to the families of 137 passengers killed when a Korean Air
Lines plane strayed into Soviet territory and was shot down six
years ago.
   All 269 people aboard were killed in the Sept. 1, 1983 disaster.
   The jury of three men and three women decided on punitive
damages two hours after returning a verdict that KAL had committed
willful misconduct.
   The jury concluded that actions by KAL's crew aboard Flight 007
were a cause of the aircraft's destruction by a missile-firing
Soviet fighter plane.
   Several family members clapped their hands when the finding of
willful misconduct was announced, and one woman in the front row
wept.
   The $50 million punitive damages, if upheld, will be shared
equally by the 137 families. About two-thirds of the families who
sued are American, the rest various other nationalities. Families
of victims who did not sue get no share.
   Without the finding of willful misconduct, the families would
have been limited to compensation of $75,000 per passenger, a
figure set by international treaty.
   With the finding, the families are free to seek individual
damages for such things as lost earnings of a parent or spouse in
individual lawsuits in federal courts around the country.
   One hundred thirty-seven such lawsuits were consolidated into
one case in Washington, the case decided Wednesday, to determine
only whether misconduct occured and whether punitive damages should
be awarded.
   George Tompkins, a lawyer defending the airline, said the
company will appeal Wednesday's verdict.
   In a two-week civil trial, lawyers for families of the victims
said the Boeing 747 was off course almost from the minute it left
the ground in Anchorage, Alaska, and headed out over the Pacific
Ocean for Seoul, South Korea.
   Wreckage from the disaster was found in the Sea of Japan,
hundreds of miles from the plane's scheduled flight path over the
Pacific Ocean.
   Two veteran pilots testifying as expert witnesses for the
families theorized that the plane crew made a mistake in
programming at least one of the computerized navigation systems on
board the jumbo jet while the aircraft was waiting to take off.
   The error, said the two experts, sent the plane far west of its
planned Pacific Ocean flight path and into Soviet territory, where
it was stalked by Soviet military jets.
   Other witnesses suggested the crew members knew they were off
course, but failed to return to Anchorage, Alaska, and correct the
navigational problem for fear of disciplinary action and loss of
respect from their colleagues.
   Lawyers representing KAL rejected those contentions, saying the
crew radioed a position report that put it directly on course about
an hour before it was shot down.
   Lawyers for the families suggested the crew was giving false
position reports.
   ``I think as a matter of law willful misconduct was not shown by
the evidence,'' said Tompkins.
   A defense motion to dismiss the case is pending before the judge.
   The jury's verdict ``was in accord with all the evidence,'' said
Donald Madole, a lawyer for the families. ``When this plane was
flown off course into the danger area ... it was in fact willful
misconduct.''
   ``We think justice was done,'' said Milton Sincoff, another
lawyer representing the families.
   The downing of Flight 007 ``was an unnecessary tragedy and many
unanswered questions still remain,'' a group representing some
families said in a statement after the verdict. ``We call on the
Soviet government to address the KAL 007 shootdown by helping the
victims ... including visitation rights to Sakhalin Island,'' over
which the plane was attacked.
   The families want ``clarification of what happened to the
remains of our loved ones,'' said the statement by the American
Association for Families of KAL 007 Victims.
   Eighty-one of the victims were South Korean, 61 American, 28
Japanese and the rest were other nationalities.
   At the start of the trial, U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey
Robinson suggested that both the Soviet and U.S. governments know
far more about the tragedy than has been revealed to date, but that
for national security reasons weren't disclosing it.
   ``There are people who know exactly where this plane was shot
down and how it got there ... I am willing to bet my bottom dollar
on it,'' said Robinson. ``I know what the capabilities are in this
world ... certainly as between the Soviet Union and the U.S.''
   But Robinson said ``all that is beyond our ken and nobody will
breathe a word about it.''

   Leftist guerrillas based on San
Salvador Volcano attacked an army post on the edge of the capital
Tuesday night and at least one soldier and a civilian were killed
in the fighting.
   Another soldier and two civilians were wounded in the battle
that lasted two hours and kept many of the residents of the city's
northwestern sector inside buildings or huddled behind walls or
vehicles. Gunsmoke settled over the San Ramon neighborhood where
the fighting was heaviest.
   It was the fifth time in eight months that the army post in San
Ramon has been attacked. An estimated 200 rebels are based on the
volcano and its foothills nearly reach San Salvador's city limits.
   Sgt. Ventura Lopez, who was in command of the detachment of 10
soldiers at the post, estimated the number of attackers at 60. He
said the guerrillas threw packets of TNT at the post. One explosion
ripped a hole in the roof of the single-story cinderblock building
that serves as post headquarters.
   Nearly 100 soldiers from the Belloso army brigade reinforced the
post's unit about 20 minutes after the fighting began at dusk.
Thousands of rounds from assault rifles and machine guns and
sporadic detonations of rocket-propelled grenades and TNT bombs
kept residents pinned down.
   ``All I want to do is get home,'' sobbed Leticia Ramirez, laying
face down in a trench next to a reporter while bullets whizzed
overhead.
   A helicopter circled at about 3,000 feet above the battle. Its
gunner fired bursts of tracer rounds from time to time, though the
action was beyond effective range of his M-60 machine gun.
   Leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
have fought the U.S.-backed government for nearly 10 years.
   Attacks on military posts in and near the capital have increased
during the past 10 months after three years in which San Salvador
was almost free of combat.
   During the 10 months the rebels acquired hundreds of
Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles and an estimated 2,000 AK-47
assault rifles to augment their arsenal.
   The Dragunovs have an effective range of about 2,650 feet and
have been used to damage several helicopters. The rifles have
forced air force pilots to fly higher nd abandon more missions than
at any time during the war.

   Eight Chinese performers have been missing
for a week since they left a group returning to China, but
immigration officials said Tuesday no one had contacted them on
behalf of the entertainers.
   ``All I can tell you is they haven't walked into this office and
applied for any relief,'' said David Ilchert, a spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Four other Chinese citizens have chosen to defect in San
Francisco since the June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
in Beijing.
   If the eight entertainers who fled the Kun Opera company last
week seek political asylum in the United States, it would be the
largest single defection of Chinese citizens since the 1950s.
   ``Everybody in China wants to leave, so whoever has a chance to
go out of China, they will try to stay there,'' said Jeffrey Shia,
president of the Kiangsu Chekiang Association, a non-profit
association that helps Chinese immigrants.
   The performers left the 28-member opera over a two-day period
last week while the company was in San Francisco en route to
Shanghai following a series of performances in the United States.
   ``We have had zero contact with them or with the consulate,''
said FBI spokesman Chuck Latting. ``We would like to talk to them.
We always want any defector to know that we are a wonderful
umbrella for them. We can help them get to us or any other agency.''
   The opera company flew back to Shanghai on Thursday, according
to Officer Larry Higgins, coordinator of VIP travel at San
Francisco International Airport.
   A spokesman for the Chinese consulate confirmed the eight
performers did not leave with the company.
   ``They were influenced by people with ulterior motives,'' said
spokesman Wang Shaohua.
   Officals of the Chinese consulate in San Francisco have blamed
the disappearance on ``people with motives to bring damage to
China.''
   The missing entertainers include Hua Wen-Yi, a famous opera
singer in Shanghai. Two other singers in the group, Chen Tong-Shen
and Zhan Ping-Ping, also are well known in Shanghai. Zhan is a
famous television and film star as well as an opera performer. The
others were identified as Qui Huan, Chen Chi-Ping, Ma Xin-Bao,
Peter Chong and Lou Sei-Long.
   ``I think at this moment they fear making a wrong move _ whether
they should seek political asylum or use other reasons to remain
here,'' said Shia.
   ``I think they are going to wait until this incident is cooled
off and then decide what options they should take,'' he said.
   Although accounts of the disappearances differ, Shia, who spoke
with several opera members last Wednesday, gave this description:
Two members left during a farewell dinner on July 25, two others
left that evening, three group leaders early the next day,
Wednesday, and one performer left Wednesday morning.
   Jon Wu, an attorney who specializes in immigration and who has
represented defectors, said the performers have numerous legal
options.
   Because they arrived in San Francisco June 5, they are eligible
for the emergency ``deferred departure status'' announced by the
Bush administration in June. The policy offers a one-year blanket
visa extension to all Chinese citizens who were in the country on
or before June 5.
   Alternatively, political asylum is ``tough for people to get who
haven't really expressed any opinions'' against the Chinese
government, Wu said.
   Shia said if the performers were involved in the pro-democracy
movement in China, they would not have been allowed to leave.
   Other options to remain in the United States include permanent
labor certification, temporary work authorization or permanent
residency if a relative successfully petitions on behalf of a
Chinese citizen.

   Twenty consultants earned more than $5.7
million by helping funnel much of the money in a federal housing
program to developers in a handful of states that didn't need it,
says a report to a Senate committee.
   Most of the 20 consultants were former Housing and Urban
Development employees or well-connected Republicans, said a report
by HUD Inspector General Paul Adams. The consultants were paid by
developers to help them get about one-fifth of the money from a HUD
program to repair housing for the poor.
   Adams has reported before on the use of consultants in obtaining
funds from HUD, but the new report is the first attempt to
determine the extent and expense of the practice.
   Under the HUD program, developers were eligible for tax credits
and could get HUD to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwise
couldn't afford it.
   In all, 51 projects with a total of 7,268 apartments funded
since October 1983 used consultants, Adams' report found. That
accounts for about 20 percent of all HUD's work in this area during
that time.

Judiciary Committee.
   The idea was raised by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
on Tuesday after Lucas' defeat in a pair of 7-7 votes that Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh labeled ``raw politics.''
   A spokesman said Thornburgh is studying whether Lucas could be
given a recess appointment to the job after Congress' scheduled

Bush likely would not want to anger Congress so early in his term
by defying the Senate over Lucas, who was criticized by opponents

   The United States must be prepared to accept
the likelihood that more astronauts will be killed if space
missions become routine, according to a report submitted to
Congress today.
   ``If such risks are perceived to be too high, the nation may
decide to reduce its emphasis on placing humans in space,'' said
the report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
   Space shuttle reliability to date, with one catastrophic failure
in 29 launches _ the 1986 explosion of Challenger _ is 96.5 percent
and a contractor estimated last year that a representative chance
of mission success is 98 percent. The price of increased space
activity includes ``the likelihood that loss of life will occur,''

<HEAD>Already Poor, Nepal Tightens Belt After Trade Dispute with India</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arguing with a big neighbor can be
costly, as Nepal is discovering four months after losing the first
round of a trade dispute with India.
   Already one of the world's poorest countries, landlocked and
mountainous Nepal faces difficult times unless it can come to terms
with India on transporting its exports and imports across India at
previously favored rates.
   As a result of the dispute, Nepal's deficit budget proposed for
the fiscal year that started July 1 calls for expenditures to rise
by 32 percent, compared to 8 percent the previous fiscal year.
   Gasoline prices have been raised by 48 percent. That reflects a
threefold vulnerability of the Nepalese economy: steeper transit
costs across India, the declining value of the Nepalese rupee, and
fluctuating crude oil prices in the Middle East.
   Nepalese optimists say the trade and transit crisis with India
will force Nepal to develop its own infrastructure and become less
reliant on others' largesse.
   Pessimists say any such period of adjustment will take several
years and further sap the resources of the country.
   Although the Nepalese-Indian dispute was sparked by treaty terms
on bilateral trade and Nepal's access to Indian transit facilities
for third-country trade, many observers in the region see a deeper
_ and to some a more sinister _ reason. They describe it as India's
growing power and ambitions as a major military, political and
economic force in the region.
   India rejects such contentions.
   Nepal's strength is in its majestic mountains and mystique that
attract the tourists who provide about 20 percent of the country's
foreign exchange earnings. Another 20 percent comes from the export
of carpets, a business dominated by Tibetan refugees who fled
Chinese rule in their homeland across the border.
   Its chief weakness is poverty. Nepal's per capita annual income
is $150. The World Bank and United Nations Children's Fund record
only two other countries with equal or worse economic misery:
Bhutan, where the per capita income also is $150, and Ethiopia,
where it is $120.
   ``Nepal cannot remain an island of poverty any longer between
the two countries in the region that are growing _ India and
China,'' Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya said in an
interview. ``Nepal also has to grow.''
   Growth, he added, includes expanding ties beyond India.
   India, with a population of 880 million, and Nepal, with 17
million people, had ``a special relationship'' between 1950 when
the mountain kingdom emerged from hermit-like isolation and last
March 23, when their trade and transit treaties lapsed.
   Nepal, seeking to lessen dependence on its big neighbor, has
been steadily diversifying its trading partners over the past 15
years. But to import goods, it relied on preferential rights to use
India's seaports, railroads and highways.
   This year, Nepal wanted to renew the two separate trade and
transit treaties. But India insisted on a single treaty linking the
two issues, saying it was unfair for Nepal to expect generous
transit privileges to import goods from other nations which often,
as Foreign Minister Upadhyaya and other Nepalese officials
acknowledged, end up getting smuggled back to India and sold at a
profit.
   In 1975, 82 percent of Nepal's foreign trade was with India. By
April 1989, it had shrunk to 28 percent, according the fiscal
1988-89 economic survey issued in July by King Birendra's
government.
   The proposed 1989-90 budget, released at the same time, calls
for expenditures of about $736 million, with a deficit of $81.8
million to be financed primarily by foreign and domestic borrowing.
   One of the biggest increases is in petroleum products, which
Nepal has started purchasing on the international market instead of
buying from India, itself a net importer of oil.
   Petroleum and other Nepalese imports still pass through India,
but India closed 13 of the 15 authorized border transit points when
the March treaties lapsed and hassles at the two remaining points
still crop up periodically.
   For the Nepalese consumer, this has resulted in rationing and
skyrocketing prices, although the gasoline shortage of last spring
and early summer is starting to ease. Most Nepalese don't have
cars, but those who do are now paying the equivalen of $3.18 a
gallon instead of $2.18 a gallon.

   Generations of fishermen reaped a bounty
from the Lambro River before it became laced with garbage, smelly
sewage and pesticides.
   Today the Italy beloved by poets, authors and artists hides much
of its legendary beauty in a pall of smog, acres of concrete and
millions of tons of industrial waste and urban garbage. Its waters
are becoming poisoned, its landscape scarred, its forests withered
by acid rain.
   Ecologists see the Lambro as one symptom of Italy's allergic
reaction to its own 20th century. They say its fetid banks are a
result of the feverish postwar economic expansion.
   Chemical wastes and agricultural runoff contaminate the Lambro
as it flows like a sewer through Italy's industrial heartland, from
near Lake Como past Milan to just west of Piacenza where it empties
into the Po.
   The Po, the country's longest and most polluted river, winds
through some of Italy's most fertile farmland before it spills its
toxins into the increasingly endangered Adriatic Sea.
   ``The Lambro is responsible for 30 percent of the total
pollution in the Po,'' said Gianfranco Mascazzini, an environmental
official with Lombardy's regional government. ``So the pollution is
not only a problem because of what it does in Lombardy, but also
because of what it does to the Po and the Adriatic.''
   Still, he noted, the pollution is seeping into Lombardy's soil
and beginning to contaminate the aquifier that supplies 90 percent
of Milan's drinking water.
   A year ago the government approved a five-year, $3.55
billion-project to clean the air, soil and water around the Lambro.
It hailed the plan as a model, one that could lead to $22 billion
in additional spending if extended to the rest of Italy.
   The work has not begun.
   It has been stalled primarily by political squabbling common at
all layers of Italian government. Various local governments and
private industry have fought over their share of the financing and
control of the project.
   Environmental groups maintain the plan is just another temporary
remedy doomed to fail because it will not do enough to fight the
sources of pollution.
   Mario Zerbini, a spokesman for the environmental Greens Party,
and Michele Mauri, a World Wildlife Fund ecologist, contend the
government is too strongly allied with big business, lacks the
political will to confront long-term problems and reacts only to
emergencies, such as the current algae invasion along Adriatic
coastal resorts.
   A recent Ministry of the Environment report noted that Italy has
only the capacity to legally dispose of about 30 percent of the
97.4 million tons of waste it produces each year, including 3.8
million tons considered toxic or dangerous.
   The report said half the 1,600 water purification plants in
cities with a total population of 23 million don't work. It added
that 2 million people in other cities drink water tainted with
herbicides and pesticides.
   The ministry said at least half the trees in Italian forests
suffer damage from acid rain. In 1987 alone, it said, Italy coughed
380,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, 2
percent of the Earth's emissions of the gas that is considered a
major contributor to the ``Greenhouse Effect,'' or warming of the
planet.
   ``Italy was relatively slow to come to awareness about its
evironmental problems,'' said Christopher Flavin, a vice president
with the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C.
   ``Compared to northern Europe the air and water quality is worse
... and Italy has a lot more toxic wastes. It is a result of its
lagging policies,'' Flavin said in a telephone interview.
   Environment Minister Giorgio Ruffolo said earlier this year that
the government hopes to reduce pollution by 35 percent to 40
percent over five years. And Mascazzini, the Lombardy environmental
official, argues the Lambro plan is a new beginning toward that end.
   ``We agree that it is no longer possible to arrive at
conclusive, effective environmental results by confronting the
problems a piece at a time,'' Mascazzini said. ``The Lambro plan is
an attempt to better organize the realization of so many things, so
many projects.''
   Its intent is to restore the land area between the Lambro,
Seveso and Olona rivers. It would build five new water purification
plants and enlarge 40 others, construct new sewer networks, pumping
stations and waste treatment plants.
   The plan also would invest millions of dollars to clean the air,
muffle the noise, build new parks and nature reserves and add
safeguards to high-risk industries in densely populated areas.

<HEAD>Egyptian Revives Ancient Art of Making Papyrus Paper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hassan Ragab's dreams once fit into a
bathtub. Thirty years later they cover an island in the Nile and
have made him not only Egypt's papyrus king but also Pharaoh of a
imaginary kingdom from the days of King Tut.
   The realm of the 78-year-old former diplomat and engineer is
Jacob's Island, a finger of land south of Cairo where he first
established a papyrus farm, then re-created a 3,300-year-old
village to give tourists glimpses of ancient Egyptian life from
flat-bottom barges.
   Papyrus is everywhere on the island.
   His love affair with the willowy river plant began in 1955,
after his appointment as Egypt's first ambassador to China. On a
countryside tour, he saw workers making paper by hand.
   ``I thought of my own country, once world-famous for producing
paper from the papyrus plant,'' he said. ``Everything was written
on it, from peace treaties to marriage contracts to medical
instructions.''
   But by the middle of the 20th century, ``papyrus was finished in
Egypt, except for a few ornamental plants,'' he added. ``I thought
how great it would be if I could start a little industry, making
paper again.''
   In 1960, with papyrus stalks he cut in Sudan, Ragab began
experimenting in his bathtub.
   No one else could help him, he said, because papyrus-making,
like mummification, was so sacred the ancients reserved it for the
Pharaohs.
   For six years Ragab cut papyrus pulp into strips, soaked them,
dried them, hammered and pressed them into sheets.
   Nothing worked.
   ``I was down to my last coin,'' he said. ``Even my family
thought I was stupid. One day my wife came in and gave me a choice
of her or the dirty bathtub.
   ``But fortunately, for the papyrus industry and for me, I
discovered my mistakes. I still had both a wife and a bathtub.''
   Ragab opened his first Papyrus Institute, which he called ``One
of the Seven Wonders of Modern Egypt,'' on a little houseboat in
the Nile in 1966, growing the plant in surrounding Nile shallows.
   His papyrus paper attracted artists, who duplicated tomb
paintings, golden faces of King Tut and ancient medical manuscripts.
   Lightweight and exotic, papyrus is ``the only true Egyptian
souvenir,'' Ragab said. Egyptian presidents give papyrus as gifts.
In 1984, President Hosni Mubarak went to Washington with a Ragab
portrait of the Sphinx with President Ronald Reagan's face instead
of a Pharaoh's.
   Ragab estimates his industry now earns $100 million a year
locally, $40 million internationally.
   But Ragab's success was too great. Hundreds of papyrus factories
sprang up, many making fake paper from banana skins or corn husks.
Few tourists could tell the difference.
   ``You even have two villages with 30,000 people who gave up
farming a couple of years ago, just to grow, make, paint and market
papyrus,'' Ragab said.
   He then had another idea.
   ``I realized there was no place for a tourist to learn about
ancient Egypt, about what he was seeing in the museums,'' he said.
``And I looked at Jacob's Island.''
   What he saw in his mind's eye was ``a living village from the
golden days of the New Kingdom, the time of King Tut and Ramses.''
   He started work on it in the early 1980s, hired actors to take
the roles of ancient Egyptians and by the time Dr. Ragab's
Pharaonic Village opened in 1985, he had poured $8 million into it,
a fortune built with papyrus.
   But tourist agencies avoided it and many still do. Tour books
didn't mention it and most still don't.
   But Ragab holds on.
   ``This should be the first stop for any tourist,'' said art
teacher Pat Cline, of Ingleside, Ill., in front of a scaled-down
Pharaonic temple. ``It teaches you so much. It's going to be one of
our favorite highlights of Egypt.''
   Equally as enthusiastic was Dr. Adel Ibrahim, a surgeon from
Huntington, W.Va., who had brought his wife and three children to
Egypt to learn something of his native land.
   ``It's a miracle,'' Ibrahim told Ragab. ``You've done Egypt
proud.''
   Ragab smiled.

<HEAD>Soviet Tourists in Israel Trade Caviar for Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soviet tourists, starved for consumer
goods back home, are trading caviar for computers and using
borrowed rubles to buy video cassette recorders.
   ``This video will pay for the trip,'' said Natalya, a Moscow
housewife in her 40s, clutching a VCR at Ben-Gurion International
Airport.
   ``Everybody is buying videos. I wanted to bring another one for
my son, but I did not have the money.''
   As a result of a thaw in Soviet relations with Israel, thousands
of Soviet Jews have been visiting relatives and friends in Israel.
   En route many stop in Larnaca, Cyprus, to purchase electronic
goods that can be resold in the Soviet Union where a VCR can fetch
the equivalent of 10 months' salary _ about 2,000 rubles, $3,140 at
the official rate of exchange.
   Natalya and other travelers demanded anonymity because they
feared reprisals for engaging in black market transactions.
   One recent flight from Cyprus carried 60 Soviet tourists with 26
VCRs and two double-deck radio-cassette players. One Georgian
family was seen pushing a cart with three VCRs.
   The tourists are required to leave the VCRs and other goods at
the airport to be picked up when they leave Israel.
   Some Soviet visitors, who include musicians and artists of
Soviet touring groups, bring luxury items like caviar that are
scarce in Israel to trade for personal computers and other
electronic equipment.
   ``My refrigerator was packed with caviar tins,'' said Shmuel
Weismel, an Israeli computer programmer in Jerusalem who recently
hosted a Soviet theater troupe.
   He said the Soviets brought French perfume and caviar purchased
on the black market back home and sold them here for several times
the price.
   They then bought personal computers, which cost $2,000 to $4,000
in Israel. An additional $7,850 must be paid in customs taxes when
they arrive back home. But once in the Soviet Union, a computer can
be sold to a factory or a state-owned business for the equivalent
of $78,500 to $110,000.
   Other Soviet visitors select one of a half-dozen Israeli firms
offering a different way to buy electronics.
   ``We offer a transit deal,'' said Boris Sterenhal of Tal-Hen &amp;
Khanan Electronics in the Israeli coastal town of Netanya. ``Soviet
tourists order tax-free products, which are delivered by our
European branch directly to the Soviet Union.''
   The firm, which advertizes in some of the seven Russian-language
newspapers published in Israel, offers Soviet Jews radios, tape
cassette players, VCRs, televisiion sets and personal computers.
   Attendants said not a day passes without a Soviet coming into
the store ``to buy something, at least a radio.''
   But the Soviet tourists also buy other things in short supply at
home.
   Sonia, a retired biochemist from Moscow, bought a $7.50 baroque
freshwater-pearl necklace as a present for her daughter.
   ``In Moscow, its costs 200 rubles ($314),'' or about an average
month's salary, she said.
   While the Soviet Union does not allow the use of hard currency
to import luxury items, it tolerates private imports.
   ``There is a tremendous demand for all kinds of goods that the
government can't supply,'' said Galia Golan, a Soviet specialist at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. ``So they have always permitted the
black market and the second economy to continue.''

<HEAD>Watch Those Little Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is the little numbers, not the big and
obvious ones, that cause those inflation troubles. While everyone
is aware of shockingly large numbers, it is the little ones that
undermine economies.
   At the moment, 4 percent inflation is viewed as moderate, and in
fact some officials proclaim that inflation is under control. It
does look like a small number, but repeat it enough and it becomes
very, very big.
   Four percent inflation cuts a dollar to 50 cents in 13 years. It
adds $22,000 to a $100,000 house in five years. In three years it
adds 3 cents to the newsstand price of a 25-cent newspaper. Not
much? Just $9 or $10 a year.
   Except for the decade of the 1970s and early 1980s, when
inflation ran away with people's wallets, it has been little
percentages that have changed the value of our money. In 30 years
the Consumer Price Index has risen more than 300 percent.
   In appearance, 4 percent is deceitfully small, but little
numbers compound in the same manner as large numbers. Four percent
inflation this year becomes part of the base for next year's 4
percent, and on and on.
   Inflation is insidious, occurring right under the noses of
people but somehow obscured from their eyes. It happens when small
prices are raised by small amounts, and when big prices are raised
by seemingly tiny percentages.
   When a 22-cent postage stamp rose three cents it created a
temporary hullabaloo, but many people recognized 25 cents as the
next ``logical'' plateau for the price. But those three pennies
represented nearly 14 percent. If all prices rose at 14 percent a
year your dollar would be 50 cents in five years.
   A suburban weekly newspaper recently jumped to 50 cents from 40
cents, only a dime but a 25 percent increase. The fee on a credit
card went from $20 a year to $30, a $10 difference but a 50 percent
increase.
   Most people are aware of the consequences of seemingly small
increases when translated into percentages. But even when they do,
they often excuse it. Somehow, a 50-cent item ``should'' go to 55
cents rather than 52 cents.
   And, when vending machines are involved, an increase in a
50-cent candy bar must be at a minimum of 10 percent because the
machine declines to count mere pennies. In this way vending machine
inflation is created, and excused.
   Inflation also is disguised when expensive items rise by small
percentages, as in a 2 percent increase in car prices that adds
$200 to the tab, and a 3 percent rise that adds $17,000 to a
$100,000 house in about five years.
   Consider: That small percentage increase might have been
sufficient to disqualify thousands of young couples who had been
saving for a down payment. At 20 percent down, the dollars needed
would have jumped to $23,400 from $20,000.
   The same impact is felt when the variable mortgage rate rises by
one-half of 1 percent but adds $50 a month to the carrying cost, or
when a small percentage increase in valuation raises the real
estate tax $150.
   Watch those little numbers. Never let them out of your sight.
Never trust them. In just the past 10 years they have driven up the
price of milk 33 percent, single-family homes 67 percent, new cars
46 percent.
   They are devious, deceitful, and misleading. They delude
otherwise thoughtful, responsible people. While the blockbuster
numbers get blamed, those little ones hide like termites in the
foundation.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after gleaming silver trains started
rolling along the South's first rapid-transit system, a 1,582-mile
network of 150 bus routes and two rail lines with 29 stations
carries a quarter-million passengers a day.
   The Metropolitan Rapid Transit Authority has been hailed for its
safety and cleanliness. MARTA celebrated its trains' 10th birthday
with a free-ride day on July 4 that drew a record 435,000
passengers. A revitalized Underground Atlanta draws up to 100,000
extra passengers a week, many of them first-time riders.
   But MARTA has a problem: It increasingly goes where much of
Atlanta isn't.
   When MARTA was launched in 1971, the three suburban counties
that refused it _ Cobb to the northwest, Gwinnett to the northeast
and Clayton to the south _ were largely rural, and it was hard to
imagine subway cars rolling past farms and forests. Those three
counties now hold nearly 900,000 people, three-fourths the number
in the two central counties, Fulton and DeKalb, where MARTA runs.
   Despite suburban traffic that is getting worse and suburban jobs
that go begging because car-less workers can't reach them,
opposition to expanding the system remains. Joining would almost
surely mean higher taxes, and suburban politicians have been loathe
to submit to decision-makers in Atlanta.
   But the chief reason given by many opponents is the fear MARTA
will bring crime to their tranquil neighborhoods. That feeling is
widely seen as racism. MARTA's passengers reflect central Atlanta,
which is predominantly black.
   Atlantans may not like to discuss it, but few haven't heard the
acronym explained as: ``Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta.''
   ``The people you hear opposing MARTA in Cobb and Gwinnett ...
they've been pretty open about it. They don't want black people
coming into their areas,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a civil
rights leader and a member of MARTA's board since 1975. ``It's
blind prejudice and fear.''
   ``We feel its in everyone's interest to have a regional transit
agency providing all the service,'' said General Manager Kenneth M.
Gregor. ``It makes sense, it's much more cost-effective,
unencumbered by the problems of numerous political jurisdictions. I
think that position ultimately will prevail.''
   ``I think MARTA's future is contingent on that,'' said Lowery.
``Its maximum potential will never be realized until we go north to
Cobb and Gwinnett and south to Clayton. ... We at least need five
counties.''
   End-of-the-line stops on MARTA's cross-shaped rail system do a
booming business as thousands of Cobb and Gwinnett residents drive
across the county line and hop on the train. Some luxury hotels in
Cobb have even sent vans to ferry workers across the Chattahoochee
River, which marks the county line.
   But MARTA trains and buses aren't going to cross that bridge
anytime soon.
   ``They're pretty much against it, at least in my end of the
county,'' said Gwinnett County Commissioner Curtis McGill. ``A
number of the people who have moved into the south end are
transplants from DeKalb County, and a lot of them feel like MARTA
ran them out of town.''
   ``Without being obvious, people say that ease of transportation
would bring in `the undesirables' and crime,'' said Gwinnett County
Commission Chairman Lillian Webb, who has advocated at least a
trial run of MARTA buses.
   Even talking about MARTA can be tricky in the suburbs. A
discussion group with Cobb County leaders in 1980 had a ``code name
so folks wouldn't know about it,'' Gregor said.
   But more and more, suburban Atlanta may be coming to the
conclusion that something must be done. A one-mile trip down a
major thoroughfare in Cobb or Gwinnett can take more than a
half-hour, and residents of those counties named traffic as their
No. 1 problem in a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll.
   The poll found between 54 percent and 60 percent of Cobb,
Gwinnett and Clayton county residents favored MARTA trains in their
communities, although only in Cobb County were a majority willing
to pay the 1 percent sales tax that Fulton and DeKalb County
residents pay for MARTA.
   Meanwhile, Cobb County last month launched its own five-route
bus system. Ten thousand people used it the first week, more than
twice the volume expected for the first three weeks, forcing
officials to drop a radio advertising campaign for fear they
wouldn't be able to meet the demand.
   The busiest Cobb Community Transit route is one dropping
commuters at a midtown Atlanta MARTA subway station. Ultimately,
the service plans 10 routes, including three more Atlanta express
runs. Riders get free transfers to MARTA under a deal that allows
MARTA riders to hop on Cobb County's buses.
   The system, costing the county an estimated $2 million a year,
makes more sense than giving MARTA an estimated $65 million a year
in local sales taxes, said Craig Aronoff, chairman of the CCT
Advisory Board. ``It doesn't look like it would make sense to
provide more than we provide. ... MARTA's the best system in the
country, but it doesn't have all the answers.''
   ``In my judgment, they're fooling themselves,'' Gregor said.
``Ten bus routes aren't going to even dent, aren't going to put an
infinitesimal impact, on their traffic congestion. And starting a
bus system that brings four routes in the city of Atlanta ain't
going to do it.''
   Clayton County has no public transportation. Gwinnett, which has
none either, will vote next year on some sort of mass transit
referendum. Mrs. Webb hopes it will once and for all answer
questions like what the county wants and will pay for.
   ``I hope they'll use reason and understanding, rather than ...
illogical rationale,'' she said, pointing out that the county's
330,000 population will more than double in the next 20 years.
``The sheer mathematics of it says we have got to come up with some
method of handling all those people.
   ``It's inevitable. It's time to fish or cut bait.''

<HEAD>Michael Wilding Joins Cast of CBS' `Dallas'</HEAD>

   Michael Wilding made his film debut as a
street urchin when his mother, Elizabeth Taylor, played Kate in
``Taming of the Shrew'' in Italy.
   Richard Burton, his stepfather at the time, played Petruchio in
the 1967 film.
   ``I ran alongside Petruchio's horse on the way to the wedding,''
said Wilding, who has joined the cast of CBS' ``Dallas.''
   ``My brother, Christopher Wilding, was also an extra. I had
braces on my teeth and we wore little codpieces and velvet caps. We
kept shouting, `Petruchio, Petruchio.'''
   After that beginning, Wilding's acting was put on hold for many
years in favor of education. His major role so far was that of
Jesus Christ in the NBC miniseries ``A.D.''
   The son of Taylor and the late Michael Wilding Sr., has his
mother's violet eyes and dark complexion. His black hair has
streaks of gray.
   Wilding will play art dealer Alex Barton in the new ``Dallas''
season.
   ``He's kind of a Henry Higgins because he finds a young artist
and sees a great potential in her,'' he said of Barton. ``He feels
he can steer her in the right direction to become a great artist.
She's a primitive artist, like Grandma Moses.''
   The young artist is Callie Harper Ewing, the wife of J.R. Ewing
played by Cathy Podewell. A romantic interest develops between the
two. Larry Hagman, of course, is J.R.
   ``I haven't had any scenes with Larry,'' Wilding said. ``So far,
J.R. doesn't know anything about us or he isn't interested enough.
There's such a contrast between Barton and Callie. He's incredibly
worldly and sophisticated and she's a country girl.
   ``I think he feels he can steer her into becoming a worldly and
stylish person with a bit of tutoring. He wants to change her.
Personally, I'd leave her the way she is. She's a very sweet lady.''
   More recently, Wilding had a small role in one of his mother's
projects, ``Sweet Bird of Youth'' for NBC. He plays a movie
producer who tries to talk his mother, playing a fading actress,
into working in a film.
   ``In the scene we're on the telephone, so I just played one side
of the conversation,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to seeing the
scene put together. When I got the part I thought it would be fun
to work with her, but I guess she filmed her part several weeks
later. I've yet to act in a scene with her.''
   Wilding and his wife, actress Brooke Palance, the daughter of
Jack Palance, recently made Taylor a grandmother again. Their son,
Tarquin, was born about two weeks ago. Wilding has two daughters,
Laela and Naomi, from a previous marriage.
   He moved from New York to Los Angeles a few months ago to find
work.
   ``I knew there's be more work here,'' he said, ``but I'm still
going through withdrawal symptoms. I'd been quite stubborn about
making myself believe there was work in New York.''
   He got the role in ``Dallas'' by auditioning for it.
   Asked about the advantages or disadvantages of famous parents,
Wilding said, ``I really don't think it opened any doors. I think
it got me some interviews. If I was doing an Off Broadway show it
would arouse some interest. But I don't think it got me any roles,
which is the way I want it. I'd hate to go through my career
thinking my parts came because of my parents.''
   Wilding grew up mostly in Europe and attended Swiss and English
boarding schools. He had a tutor when he went on location with his
parents.
   ``I grew up on locations,'' he said. ``I still love locations. I
remember being on the sets for `Cleopatra.' They had some great
naval battles. That was fun for a 9-year-old. She entered Rome on a
sphinx pulled by Nubian slaves. It opens up and thousands of doves
fly out. I remember when all the extras were assembled to hail

course in universities.
   Instead, an elective introduction to religion class will include
lessons both on atheism and Christianity, says the Rev. Yakov K.

Christians-Baptists of the Ukraine.
   ``This is God's timing for our country,'' he told the Slavic

   Citing figures that only a tiny fraction of
young women counseled at pro-life centers give their babies up for
adoption, syndicated ``Ethics and Religion'' columnist Michael J.
McManus calls it ``a scandal.''
   He says 300,000 babies are born annually to unmarried teen-agers
with scant prospects as mothers, but only 1 percent of those
counseled by Birthright centers and 4 percent of those counseled by
the Christian Action Council centers offer the newborns for
adoption and a more secure future.
   ``It is as if the pro-life forces are only `pro-life' up until
the birth of the baby _ with little pro-life concern after birth,''
he writes.

   The National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus has
called for study of developing an African-American rite within the
Catholic Church. Such a rite has been urged by a suspended
Washington priest, the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr.
   Brother Roy Smith, caucus president, said Stallings brought the
issue of racism within the church to the forefront and ``heightened
the discussion of the intensity of those issues.''
   Stallings several weeks ago founded the Imani Temple, a church
that combines elements of Roman Catholicism with African and
Southern black traditions. He was suspended by Cardinal James
Hickey of Washington.
   The Rev. Victor Cohea, a caucus board member, said the issue of
an African-American Catholic rite is almost a century old, but this
is the first time in the 20th century that a group of black
Catholics has proposed study of such a rite.
   The caucus met in Milwaukee this week with the National Black
Catholic Seminarians and the National Black Sisters' Conference.

<HEAD>Protestant Denominations Stiffen Reservations About Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most major Protestant denominations which once
widely condoned abortion now either oppose it or specify
limitations to it. They've modified their positions.
   The changes have come over the last decade as abortions went on
at the rate of about 1.5 million a year and advances in embryology
increased understanding of the developing fetus.
   Aware of such factors, denominational conventions, one after
another, have qualified their stands on abortions, voicing
misgivings about it and condemning use of it for various purposes.
   ``They've back-pedaled,'' said the Rev. J. Robert Nelson,
director of the Institute of Religion of the Texas Medical Center
in Houston.
   He said the ``staggering statistics'' and the new therapeutic
embryology on distinctive characteristics of the fetus as not part
of the woman's body, ``have made for second and third thoughts''
about abortion.
   ``The whole movement toward more conservative religious
positions also doubtlessly accounts to some extent for the shift,''
he added in a telephone interview.
   The revisions began long before the recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision expanding state jusisdiction on the issue, but became
general among mainline denominations in the 1980's.
   Although recognizing abortion's legality and individual
decision-making about it, four major Protestant denominations last
year added extensive circumstances in which it was rejected.
   The Episcopal Church, stiffening its past stance, sanctioned
abortion ``only in extreme situations. We emphatically oppose
abortion as a means of birth control, family planning, sex
selection, or any reason of mere convenience.''
   The United Methodist Church, while recognizing ``tragic
conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion,'' added
opposition to it as a means of birth control or gender selection.
   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) added language saying abortion
``should not be used for convenience or to ease embarrassment or as
a means of birth control.'' The church, now engaged in a major
reappraisal of the abortion issue, has scheduled a pro-and-con
dialogue on it Nov. 17-19 in Kansas City.
   American Baptist Churches, in a revised, middle-ground stance,
denounced ``irresponsible sexual behaivor'' contributing to the
``large number of abortions each year,'' and says:
   ``As American Baptists we oppose abortion, as a means of
avoiding responsibility for conception, as a primary means of birth
control without regard for the far-reaching consequences of the
act.''
   However, the United Church of Christ maintains a clearly
pro-choice position, reaffirming it in July at a general synod in
Fort Worth, Texas, at the same time the high court upheld some
state prerogatives on the issue.
   The denomination deplored the court decision, charging it would
make ``freedom of choice'' difficult for the poor. It also,
however, set a special ``theology colloquy'' on the the subject
Aug. 13-18 in Craigville, Mass.
   While Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), the Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod and various evangelical churches have steadily condemned
abortion, several Protestant bodies joined that effort near the
turn of the l980's.
   About that time, the nation's biggest Protestant body, Southern
Baptists, began stiffening opposition to abortion, and now condemns
it in all cases except to save the life of the mother.
   The former Lutheran Church in America, now merged into the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, toughened its anti-abortion
stand in 1980 and 1984, when it opposed all abortions as destroying
life.
   Laws were urged protecting it ``from conception to birth.''
   Episcopalians, revising their position about it last year, voted
down proposed language that would have opposed legislative
restrictions on abortion. Such legislatives moves incubated
following the recent high court decision.
   Orthodox Jews condemn abortion except when the mother's life is
endangered, while Reform and Conservative Judaism approve it in
less threatening situations.
   The National Council of Churches, including most major
Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations, has never taken a
position on abortion because of diverse views about it.
   Most churches historically had condemned abortion prior to the
1973 Supreme Court ruling allowing it, but mainline Protestant
bodies afterward moved to support the decision and right of women
to abortion.
   While some still uphold that right, they've raised sharpened
reservations about it. Of the keen stress over the issue, Episcopal
Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning said:
   ``We know that, at its heart, abortion involves tragedy, as the
loss of any life or promise of life can be tragic. The reasons for
abortions can involve other tragedies.
   ``Our discussion of abortion must begin with an understanding
that we are dealing with a tangled web of rights and wrongs, good
and evil, and greater and lesser tragedies.''

   The Statue of Liberty welcomes the world's
tired and wretched poor, but these days the United States beckons
the world's brightest and most ambitious as well.
   Nations which see their brightest people settle in the United
States, or come here to study and stay to work, have a name for the
phenomena: ``the brain drain.''
   In this country, it could be called the brain rain _ the
enrichment of the American terrain by smart people who find this
land fertile.
   It has been going on for two centuries, but the magnet nowadays
is a secret American asset _ the quality of U.S. graduate school
education. Public schooling may be in a mess, but graduate schools
here are a wonder of the academic world.
   Now a crackdown in China and liberalization in the Soviet Union
may mean those countries will join others in wondering how to get
their smart young people home after they've seen the labs at MIT.
   In a gesture comparable to tearing down the Berlin Wall, the
Soviet Union is moving to relax barriers that have kept Russians
from leaving. (U.S. trade concessions would likely result.)
   About 33,000 Russians emigrated to the United States last year.
This year, they're coming at the rate of 120,000. Next year, says
Max Robinson, the U.S. consul in Moscow, the number could approach
250,000. Many are the Soviet Union's smartest, best trained people.
Under a draft Soviet law, Soviet citizens would be free to leave if
they can wangle an invitation from almost any business,
organization or individual.
   When the democracy movement perished in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, 29,040 Chinese students were enrolled in American schools,
part of a contingency of 355,000 foreign students studying in this
country.
   Many of the Chinese are likely to want to stay. If they succeed,
it will be a setback for China's modernization drive, a bonus for
America.
   Fear of losing talented people has been ``a traditional problem
in communist regimes,'' says John Pike, a space expert at the
Federation of American Scientists.
   ``That was basically what led to the Berlin Wall; the best and
the brightest were bailing out of East Germany,'' he said. ``One
reason communist economies have done so poorly is because the cream
always was skimmed off.''
   China expert Leo A. Orleans, in an analysis written for the
Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People's Republic of
China, said even before Tiananmen Square that any decision by
Chinese students to remain abroad would be seen by China as not
only ``a loss to the country, in terms of both money spent on their
education and their potential contribution to China's development,
but also a painful loss of face.''
   ``The `flight of intellectual capital' has been of great concern
to all developing countries, especially since those individuals who
tend to remain abroad are precisely the ones with the greatest
initiative and enterprise,'' Orleans observed.
   China depended upon foreign schooling as a way of leaping into
the 21st century. China itself was capable of granting a piddling
664 PhDs between 1981 and 1987.
   Before leaving home, Chinese students are warned that their
parents may suffer if they don't return, Orleans said.
   Betty Vetter, executive director of the Commission of
Professionals in Science and Technology, said China put its
traveling students on tight timetables _ two years for earning a
masters degree, five for a Phd, and then home again, please.
American students usually take eight years for a PhD, and that's
without a language barrier to overcome.
   The brain drain troubles American allies, too. Canada loses
talent to the lure of the big market to the south, and England
loses faculty. British universities are cutting back on staffing
and ``many major American universities are picking up the stars of
the British academic world,'' said Dan Greenberg, editor and
publisher of Science &amp; Government Report.
   If China's students now in this country stay, could the United
States absorb them?
   Profitably, Greenberg said. Many are in mathematics and
engineering, where shortages exist.
   Whether they stay or go home, said Ms. Vetter, training foreign
students ``is a good deal for the U.S. for all kinds of reasons.
Some stay and become an essential part of the work force. Those who
go home, generally take a sense of Americana and Americans that
will stand us in good stead in the global economy. If all goes as
it ought to, they will think fondly of America and that's bound to
be a benefit.''

<HEAD>Rate Declines Challenge Money-Fund Investors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve's easing of its credit
policy and the accompanying drop in interest rates have posed a
$325 billion question for investors in money market mutual funds.
   Should they sit tight with their money in the face of declining
yields, or look elsewhere for better returns?
   If the past record is any guide, the vast majority of money fund
assets will stay put.
   From 1975, when the earliest money funds had attracted less than
$4 billion, to this year, when their assets have swollen by more
than $50 billion from $272 billion at the end of 1988, the
long-term industry trend has shown almost uninterrupted growth.
   Periods of low or falling interest rates halted the funds'
expansion only briefly.
   In 1983, for example, when interest rates were falling and
stocks were soaring in the early stages of a spectacular bull
market, money fund assets shrank by about 20 percent. A year later,
they rebounded once again to new highs.
   Today's savers and investors have a wider range of competitive
alternatives to choose among than ever before.
   And thanks to rallies in the stock and bond markets, funds that
invest in those long-term securities have been producing
substantially higher returns than money funds have offered.
   Late last month, Donoghue's Moneyletter, a newsletter that
tracks developments affecting fund investors, issued a ``buy''
signal recommending a move from money funds to growth stock funds
for venturesome investors.
   But with all that, many investors _ especially those who view
their money fund holdings as a kind of modern-day savings account _
may find few other choices that appeal more to them on the basis of
both risk and potential reward.
   The risks of stock market investing, of course, are well
advertised. At a recent yield of 8.85 percent, analysts point out,
money funds still offer rewards close to the historical average
annual return of 9 percent to 10 percent posted by the stock market.
   What about the other alternatives? Tax-free money funds,
investing in state and local government securities whose interest
is not subject to federal taxation, recently were yielding about
5.6 percent to 5.7 percent.
   That put them at an unattractive level, by Donoghue's reckoning,
even for an investor in the 33 percent bracket.
   Bank money-market deposit accounts have the allure of federal
deposit insurance, but their typical yields of about 6.5 percent
languish far below their money fund competitors.
   People wanting to lock in yields as protection against further
declines in interest rates traditionally turn to long-term bond
investments. These days, however, they aren't very well compensated
for making that commitment.
   In late July the yield available on the longest-term Treasury
bonds slipped below 8 percent.
   Double-digit yields can still be found in abundance in so-called
``junk bonds'' and the mutual funds that specialize in these
lower-rated securities. But some advisers say this is an especially
dangerous time to be increasing credit risk.
   ``Much of the newly issued `junk' securities have not been
tested in a period of prolonged adversity,'' says the Boston-based
United &amp; Babson Investment Report. ``A sacrifice in yield is well
worth the price of safety, and a good night's sleep.''
   Indeed, while investors are casting a wary eye on the other
options, analysts say they may want to give their money funds a
fresh appraisal as well.
   Sponsors of two funds, the Value Line Cash Fund and the Liquid
Green Trust, reached into their own pockets in June to cover losses
that resulted from a default on short-term securities issued by
Integrated Resources Inc.
   As a result of their response, fund shareholders lost no money.
But the experience was ``a humbling lesson,'' as Donoghue's
described it, for an industry that prides itself on its safety
record.

   It takes a mighty aggregation of man, machine
and fossil- fuel power to move the gross national product a
fraction of a point, but in Washington it can be done by
researchers using only calculator power.
   They do it again and again, month after month, revising
important economic measurements, some of which might have been,
when first announced, the basis for decisions regarding business
and economic policy.
   Revisions are a regular occurrence in statistics, produced
mainly by access to additional information or changes in
methodology. In some instances they are expected; in some, they are
not. In either event, they can dismay.
   Several years ago, for example, rising retail sales were
reported month after month, giving the impression of a boom. But,
when viewed after a year, sales had risen only moderately.
   The reason: The monthly increases were based not on original
figures but on later revisions. Repeatedly, those revisions were
downward, meaning increases for the following months were from a
base lower than originally stated.
   Some important revisions recently were made in estimates of
gross national product, perhaps the broadest of all economic
measurements and one that often guides the direction of fiscal and
monetary policy.
   This revision raised the growth of real GNP for 1987 to 3.7
percent from 3.4 percent, a difference of $6.7 billion, and for
1988 to 4.4 percent from 3.9 percent, a difference of $28.3 billion.
   Those aren't puny numbers, even in an economy where the value of
a billion shrinks by the day. In fact, they are momentous figures
when you consider that overheating vs. recession was one of the
biggest economic concerns in each of those years, and that the GNP
measurement was one of the primary indicators.
   Whatever, decisions must be made in a critical time frame too
immediate to wait for revisions.
   Battles are fought with the weapons on hand, not with arsenals
promised. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower launched an invasion of Europe
after reading weather reports later found to be faulty. Later,
President Eisenhower steered economic policy although, in review,
the economic data he relied upon was less than perfect.
   Statistical faults are accepted, the attitude seeming to be that
nothing better is available. If poor decisions are made, so be it.
If good news comes in the revision, enjoy it and hope it won't be
revised out later.
   Good news did indeed come in the July revisions. For one thing,
they made the trade deficit appear less ominous, in one swipe
erasing more than $25 billion from the negative 1988 numbers.
   In 1988, it is now believed that the deficit, stated in 1982
dollars, was $74.9 billion, not $100.2 billion. The main reason for
the revisions, it now appears, is that the ``exporting'' of
education and tourism was undercounted.
   Well, not quite; in the language of the fraternity, each was
``enhanced,'' but the net impact is the same no matter what
language is used. So big was the enhancement that one economist,
Robert Barbera of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., issued a comment in
a language seldom heard from economists. ``Wow,'' he said.
   How significant is it, he asked? Plenty, he said, explaining
that the trade picture in goods and services is simply that much
better, ``and the case for foreign investor panic about U.S.
imbalances is all but over.''
   Economists are known to disagree, of course; not all are saying
``wow.'' Some will claim the improvement would have been more
meaningful if it involved the export of pig iron rather than
education. Not Barbera.
   ``As we see it, it is better to have state-of-the-art schools
vs. state-of-the-art steel mills,'' he declares.
   Besides, the dollars count no matter how they are earned, or
when they are added to the accounts, or even if it takes some
recalculations to discover them.

   The goose hangs by its feet from
a thick rope stretched across the town square on the feast day of
Santiago, the patron saint of Spain. A rider on horseback passes
underneath and yanks the head off.
   He has his prize and the crowd cheers. Another goose is brought
out and strung up for another rider.
   Critics call it barbarous.
   But to the thousands of Spaniards in the villages and towns,
yearly fiestas that often involve the ritualistic killing of a
goose or a rooster or a bull are an essential part of their lives
and an affirmation of their cultural identity.
   None of the onlookers at the fiesta in this agricultural village
of 2,500 near the Tagus River in the rolling hills of central Spain
could say for certain why the eight male riders dressed in black
britches and embroidered jackets try to pull the heads off geese.
   But they know young men have been doing it every July 25, the
feast day, for 400 years, at least.
   The practice gained notice abroad about five years ago when
photographs of the event appeared in the British press. Headlines
called the Spaniards barbarians and worse. Nowadays the geese have
been injected with a tranquilizer.
   ``They're numb, they don't feel anything, that's all I'll say,''
said Mayor Pedro Villalba Cedeno.
   Anthropologists surmise that the practice grew out of a
celebration of the legendary appearance of Santiago, or St. James,
at the Battle of Navas de Tolosa in 1212, sparking a Christian
victory over the Moors.
   The geese represent the Moors, who ruled much of Spain for more
than 700 years.
   In some towns, the sacrificial victim is a bull, whose
ritualistic importance in Spain can be traced back to the
pre-historic caves across the northern part of the country and to
the Iberian culture that pre-dates the Romans.
   The bulls at one time were burned alive. Now the ends of their
horns are set alight with flaming balls of tar, sending the bulls
into panicked flight. Young boys chase them and beat them with
sticks until the fire in the tar balls dies out. In one town, the
bulls are killed after that but in others they are then left alone.
   In other towns bulls are driven over cliffs into the sea.
Townspeople rescue them from the water, but if the bulls break
their legs or are otherwise injured they are taken to the slaughter
house.
   Julio Caro Baroja, the dean of Spanish anthropologists, has done
extensive studies of the fiestas, their relation to the seasonal
cycle and the role of animals in them.
   The ritual killing of animals, he writes, serves an expiatory
function that has been incorporated, if not explicity sanctioned,
by the Roman Catholic Church.
   In El Carpio de Tajo, a rider carrying the religious banner of
St. James precedes the goose-beheaders.
   ``We've received hundreds of letters of protest from foreigners
who've read about the geese and other fiestas involving animals,''
said Alicia Tiemblo Diaz, head of information at Spain's
Secretariat for Tourism. ``I've talked to town officials who tell
me, `Let them complain. It's our fiesta, and we'll keep on doing it
the way we want.'''
   The Spanish Animal Rights Association has joined forces with
other European organizations to encourage governments of the
12-member European Economic Community to pass legislation banning
cruelty to animals. There is little likelihood such action will
prosper in Spain.
   ``Our fiestas are cruel. I didn't realize how cruel they were
until I started going out and studying them,'' said Guadalupe
Gonzalez Hontoria, director of the Museum of Popular Arts and
Traditions at Madrid's Autonomous University. ``We Spaniards do
have our brutish side, but we can also be very brave.''
   During the 36-year dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, many
fiestas, particularly those that emphasized regional or local
characteristics, were suppressed. Pre-Lenten carnivals were banned
as being too licentious until authorities figured out that it drew
tourism.
   Following the return to democracy 12 years ago, Mrs. Gonzalez
Hontoria said, Spaniards began to celebrate their fiestas with
renewed gusto.
   ``It seems now with modernization, everyone wants to go back to
his roots, and people see that they can lose their fiestas if they
don't defend them.''

exotic specimens native to Colombia _ have earned Colombia a
respectable second place after the Netherlands among
flower-exporting nations.
   Flowers represented $205 million last year in export revenues,
more than double the amount of 1980. Next year could be another
all-time record for Colombian growers and dealers if their goal of
$260 million in exports is met.
   Colombia's 8 percent to 10 percent share of the international
market over recent years, surpassing Israel and Italy, reflects the
drive of its flourishing non-traditional export industry.
   All this despite all sorts of difficulties, including
embarassing actions by drug traffickers who often smuggle cocaine
with shipments of flowers. Last year a cargo plane of Avianca, the
Colombian national airline, was seized in Miami after the police
found cocaine concealed in the soil of a flower shipment.
   Fined $3 million, Avianca halted its overseas cargo operations
and Colombian florists had to look for other airlines to ship their
flowers _ at much higher rates.
   Flower shipments now are subject to stricter controls at the
Bogota airport in an effort to detect hidden drugs.
   Flowers, Uribe said, are ``innocent victims of drug
traffickers.''
   Flower cultivators, like any other businessmen, are constantly
adapting to the mood of customers.
   ``Flowers are like clothes: colors and taste for them change,''
Uribe said. ``And we have to follow the customers' whims.''
   Flowers began as a tiny portion of Colombian exports in the
mid-1960s, when they accounted for less than $100,000 annually.
   Colombian florists feel confident that their business will be
rosier if the $8 million advertising campaign to persuade Americans
and Canadians to buy more flowers is successful.
   Studies by Colombia florists associations indicate Americans and
Canadians buy flowers mostly to give to others and rarely for
themselves.
   ``Europeans take flowers to their homes as much as they send
them as gifts,'' Uribe said. ``Our studies demonstrate that West
Germans, famous for their lavish preference for flowers, buy as
much as eight times more flowers than Canadians and Americans.''
   Colombian floriculturists joined the 28,000-member U.S. Florists
Transworld Delivery Association to launch the advertising campaign,
which begins in September.
   ``The future lies in convincing Americans and Canadians to
change habits and persuade them to buy flowers for themselves,
too,'' Uribe said.

   On this Wednesday one of the people they'd
nourished day after day, hopefully and compassionately, died. It
was all too usual.
   Word of the death was passed around the office and at a
storefront church in Harlem, the man's neighborhood. But God's Love
We Deliver Inc. kept up its work _ feeding people who are confined
to their homes by AIDS.
   ``We deal with it all the time,'' said program director Joan
Block. ``It may be harder in some ways, but it is also much richer.
The issue of life and death is the great magnifying glass.
   ``I don't get it when people ask how we can do this. It's not as
if if you worked in a bank you never had to handle the death issue.
This is a really great training program for what is inevitable for
all of us.''
   ``I don't think any of us is qualified to find a cure for
AIDS,'' said Carl Johnes, one of 450 volunteers who make sure
nearly 200 homebound AIDS patients get gourmet, high-calorie food
five days a week. ``But we are qualified to keep people alive until
such time as a cure is found, so it's a life-saving job.''
   There is eloquence in the preparation and delivery of
nourishment that provides a bounty beyond calories.
   On Valentine's Day, the delivery to Gary Gruber, a Manhattan
landscaper, included heart-shaped cookies and roses. ``I opened it
up, expecting a meal and it was a party. I started crying from
happiness.''
   There were flowers and cake on his 39th birthday. ``I didn't
know they knew,'' he said. ``But they said it was all in the
computer.''
   Early one morning, eight people chat in the small, well-equipped
kitchen in the basement at West Park Presbyterian Church in
Manhattan. They fill plastic containers of cream of mushroom soup
and containers of pasta, hamburger, and carrots and peas. There
also are a salad and homemade cookies this day.
   Soup and vegetables cook in stock pots on two stoves. The air is
stifling, and two fans do far less than volunteers' attitudes to
ease the discomfort.
   A visitor pitches in as she looks over the program with an eye
to starting something similar in Los Angeles. Later in the day, the
power goes out, and hurried plans are made to protect the food. The
clients still need meals.
   In the kitchen, there is gentle banter, about a book someone
will write, or their own efficiency. No one complains and no hands
are allowed to remain idle. Newcomers are warmly welcomed, often
with a hug, but then an apron is given over and a chore assigned.
These are people with a mission.
   ``We all do it because it makes us feel good. It isn't about
being a saint,'' said Johnes, a writer from Manhattan.
   God's Love produces made-from-scratch meals from a rotating
30-day menu that includes carrot bisque, artichoke salad, smoked
turkey, shish kebab, four-cheese lasagna, veal stroganoff, pears in
puff pastry and fruit Bavarian.
   ``We have a big food budget and we buy top quality. But we're
pretty frugal,'' said chef Luli Gray, who saves the drippings from
one day's beef for another day's soup or sauce. Leftovers are
packed, marked and frozen for use.
   A walk-in refrigerator was donated by the Gay Men's Chorus.
God's Love needs a bigger kitchen; it always needs money and
volunteers. As AIDS spreads from homosexual men to intravenous drug
users, their lovers and their children, the work will only increase.
   The goal is that no homebound person with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome ever goes hungry. ``We are dedicated to not
putting anybody on a waiting list,'' said Gary Bressler, the
organization's executive chef.
   Clients had lost an average of 18 pounds from the onset of AIDS
to the time they began receiving meals, but gained an average of 10
pounds after meals were delivered, Bressler said.
   One symptom of AIDS is loss of appetite, so he works to make
sure the food is ``not only nutritious and fattening but appetizing.
   ``We try to keep their weight up, and that's adding to their
strength ... and that's what we're here for.''
   Cooking begins daily at 7:30 a.m., and meals go into four vans
by 10 a.m., when work starts on tomorrow's meals. By 2:30 p.m.,
everyone has been fed. The kitchen closes at 9.
   ``When the kitchen opened in August 1987, we were serving six
meals. Now, we're serving 160 to 180,'' said Bressler.
   Meals go to all five New York City boroughs and Jersey City,
N.J. Some are delivered directly to homes; others are left at
churches, homes, a Red Cross office or bars, where neighborhood
volunteers take them to people with AIDS. Twenty-five or 30 meals a
day are made to suit special medical needs.
   Johnes came to God's Love as a volunteer after donating money
for a year and deciding that wasn't enough. ``I came the Friday
night before Christmas and made orange zest, crushed garlic and
peeled 25 pounds of cucumbers. I went to bed smelling like a
salad.'' On Christmas Day, he delivered meals.
   ``Nourishment is important,'' he said. ``It's not controversial.
How can you argue with people who feed other people?''
   God's Love We Deliver was conceived in 1985 when Ganga Stone,
now executive director, took groceries to a man suffering from AIDS
and was horrified to find him too weak to get up and cook the food.
She decided to do something.
   First, she cooked at home and delivered meals on her bicycle.
Then meals were solicited from restaurants. Finally, in August
1987, God's Love moved to West Park Presbyterian. From a woman on
her bike, God's Love grew to a staff of 22 and a budget for 1989 of
more than $1 million. It is financed by the New York State
Nutrition Assistance Program and other donations and grants.
   Originally, clients were mostly white, homosexual men. Now,
maybe half are intravenous drug users and their children. Many are
women.
   When Gruber was released from a hospital 1{ years ago, he called
God's Love at a friend's suggestion and talked with Stone. ``She
said how about a meal today or tomorrow, then we'll do the
paperwork.''
   When he called God's Love, ``I wasn't eating very much. I'd go
into the kitchen, open the refrigerator and think, `Oh, that's all
I can deal with,' and close it. It was too exhausting to do more.''
   When he did summon the energy to cook, Gruber said, he'd make a
big pot of spaghetti and eat the same food four days straight.
``God's Love saved my life, because I didn't want to eat. It's
really the high point of my day.''

   The National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus has
called for study of developing an African-American rite within the
Roman Catholic Church.
   Such a rite has been urged by a suspended Washington, D.C.,
priest, the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr.
   Brother Roy Smith, caucus president, said Stallings brought the
issue of racism within the church to the forefront and ``heightened
the discussion of the intensity of those issues.''
   Stallings several weeks ago founded the Imani Temple, a church
that combines elements of Roman Catholicism with African and
Southern black traditions. He was suspended by Cardinal James
Hickey of Washington.
   The Rev. Victor Cohea, a caucus board member, said the issue of
an African-American Catholic rite is almost a century old, but this
is the first time in the 20th century that a group of black
Catholics has proposed study of such a rite.
   The caucus met in Milwaukee recently with the National Black
Catholic Seminarians and the National Black Sisters' Conference.

   The board of Concordia Theological
Seminary voted to retire the seminary's president, the Rev. Robert
Preus, charging ``turmoil'' in the institution made him ineffective.
   Preus called that a ``complete fabrication.''
   Head of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod institution for 15
years, Preus said he had not wanted to retire and contended the
board's action would have a ``damaging effect on seminary income, a
demoralizing effect on the student body'' and a polarizing effect
the faculty.
   He said charges by the board that ``turmoil within the faculty''
made it impossible for him to serve effectively were false.

   Only a tiny fraction of young women counseled
at pro-life centers give their babies up for adoption and that's
``a scandal,'' says Michael J. McManus, who writes the syndicated
``Ethics and Religion'' column.
   He says 300,000 babies are born annually to unmarried teen-agers
with scant prospects as mothers, but only 1 percent of those
counseled by Birthright centers and 4 percent of those counseled by
the Christian Action Council centers offer the newborns for
adoption and a more secure future.
   ``It is as if the pro-life forces are only `pro-life' up until
the birth of the baby _ with little pro-life concern after birth,''
he writes.

   What started as a small, ridiculed but exuberant
religious experience in America around the start of the century has
swelled into a worldwide Christian phenomenon.
   Called the Pentecostal or charismatic movement, it is one of the
fastest growing forces in modern church life, spawning young
denominations and stimulating old ones.
   ``There is no question but that it is revitalizing Christianity
across the world, particularly the older forms of Christianity,''
said the Rev. David B. Barrett, a top authority on religious
demographics.
   A large, influential branch of that movement in America, the
Assemblies of God, marks its 75th anniversary at its convention
Aug. 8-13 in Indianapolis, bustling and confident.
   ``God has been very good to us and we're grateful for it,'' said
the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson of Springfield, Mo., the denomination's
general superintendent.
   ``There is enthusiasm, growth, awakening everythere,'' he added
in a telephone interview. ``We feel the future is very bright. And
that's not just puff.''
   Barrett, a British Anglican, editor of the World Christian
Encyclopedia, now working for the Southern Baptist Foreign Missions
Board in Richmond, Va., said the world's Pentecostals-charismatics
total 353 million.
   That includes 184 million Pentecostal church members, 23 million
of them in North America; 133 million ``charismatics'' in mainline
churches, 44 million in the U.S., and 30 million ``third wave''
renewalists, 12 million in the U.S.
   ``It's happening on a vast scale,'' Barrett said in a telephone
interview. ``The movement has a strong moral and ethical side. From
every point of view, it's a major and positive development.''
   The Assemblies of God, with more than 2.1 million U.S.
adherents, has grown 66 percent in the last decade from just under
1.3 million, putting it among the nation's 10 largest Protestant
denominations.
   Its missionaries have planted overseas branches, totaling an
additional 16.2 million.
   With headquarters in Springfield, Mo., it has 18 U.S. colleges,
including a seminary, and runs several health-care facilities. Its
Gospel Publishing House turns out an average of 24 tons of
religious literature a day.
   In surmounting the downfall in sex scandals of two of its
prominent TV ministers, Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart, the
denomination gained widened respect for its principled handling of
the matter.
   It firmly revoked ministerial credentials when disciplines were
rejected, although in doing so it gave up large revenues, including
$12 million annually from Swaggart's former ministry.
   But supportive ``response has been far greater,'' Carlson said,
noting that contributions to worldwide ministries were up 9.9
percent to $284 million for the last biennium.
   ``We made our decision, not on the basis of money, but on the
basis of what Scripture teaches,'' he said. ``I've been so grateful
that we've heard from many denominational leaders in appreciation
for our reinforcing the credibility of the church in the world.''
   While the Assemblies of God has kept growing, in contrast to
mainline membership declines, the gains have slackened lately.
``There are ebbs and flows,'' Carlson said.
   Asked if the denomination at its 75-year mark might be
succumbing to institutional cumbersomeness, sapping its initial
spontaneity and enthusiasm, Carlson said:
   ``I don't think so. We keep talking about that, warning against
it and listening to the counsel of the word of God, reminding the
church not to lose the fervor that the Holy Spirit loosed in it.''
   The Indianapolis convention is to launch the denomination's most
ambitious evangelism program, ``Decade of Harvest.''
   It envisions winning 5 million people to Christ, opening 5,000
new churches, and training 20,000 new ministers in the next decade,
with 1 million ``prayer partners'' praying daily for it.
   ``We've tried to keep evangelism alive,'' Carlson said. ``A lot
of people think that glossolalia (speaking in `tongues') is our
main doctrine, but it's not. Rather it's the message of Christ's
salvation. He meets the needs of humanity.''
   However, speaking or singing in ``unknown tongues'' is a
hallmark of the Assemblies of God and other Pentecostals as well as
the charismatic incursion in mainline Protestantism and Roman
Catholicism.
   Founded at a convention in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1914, the
Assemblies of God stemmed from heightened spiritual experiences in
small groups across the United States, beginning in 1901.
   Other Pentecostal denominations also arose from the
tongues-speaking revival, sometimes ridiculed as ``holy rollers.''
   But that changed as the denomination matured, Carlson said.
``We've moved across the tracks. Our congregations build nicer
buildings, and we reach into the upper middle class.''
   Tongues-speaking, considered a sign of baptism by the Holy
Spirit, derives from apostolic times, first experienced 50 days
after Christ's resurrection at Pentecost in Jerusalem, and
described in early Christian congregations.
   Historic churches shunned such practices, contending they ended
with apostolic times, but such experiences have spread through
Protestantism and Catholicism as the ``charismatic movement.''
   ``It has touched most mainline denominations,'' Carlson said.
``It's had a great deal of impact.''

   Move over Topps _ you have new competition.
But the baseball cards being marketed by the U.S. Postal Service to
promote stamp sales won't have the trademark piece of bubble gum
inside.
   The post office is easing into the card business with just four
of the popular collectibles as part of a push to shift from the
image of a neighborhood store into a modern marketing machine.
   Probably the most visible effort in this change will come in
September, in a joint campaign promoting postage stamps featuring
dinosaurs in conjunction with MCA Inc.'s home video release of the
movie ``The Land Before Time.''
   But this isn't the first tie-in between stamps and other
businesses, and it won't be the last, said Gordon C. Morison,
assistant postmaster general for philatelic and retail services.
   The baseball cards, for example, take advantage of previously
issued stamps honoring popular ballplayers. The stamps featuring
Lou Gherig, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth and Roberto Clemente have
been combined in a new albumn, with four matching baseball cards
included.
   Last year a set of stamps featuring carousel animals got special
promotions at several amusement parks around the country, Morison
said. And the agency is interested in future arrangements, perhaps
for planned stamps featuring lighthouses and marine mammals.
   And new stamps often receive special promotions when issued,
often organized by local post offices.
   For example the Key West, Fla., office prepared a special 12- by
16-inch print of the recent Hemingway stamp in the Literary Arts
series.
   Mounted on a backing with a copy of the stamp canceled on July
17, its first day of issue, the print is being offered for $25, by
mail order, to collectors and Hemingway fans.
   But the arrangement with Steven Spielberg's film about dinosaurs
is the most ambitious effort so far in the effort to boost sales of
stamps to collectors.
   Buyers of the home video will receive a little brochure
advertising the dinosaur stamps, offering for sale a T-shirt
featuring one of the stamps, and also promoting holiday seals sold
by the movie company and a special deal from Pizza Hut.
   The dinosaur stamps should appeal to youngsters, the T-shirts
and posters to both youngsters and slightly older people, Morison
said.
   With the movie going on sale in September, the promotion arrives
just in time for Stamp Collecting Month, which the post office
celebrates in October.
   The purpose of the effort is simple: getting people interested
in collecting stamps, a hobby that means big bucks for an agency
struggling to cover its ever increasing costs while avoiding
raising postage rates.
   Those little piles of stamps ``collected'' in envelopes and desk
drawers across the nation may seem like a small investment to their
owners.
   But to the U.S. Postal Service, collectors represent $150
million to $170 million in sales annually, Morison said.
   And the best part is, it's virtually all profit.
   A postage stamp is, after all, nothing more than a receipt for
advance payment for a service _ the delivery of a letter or parcel.
   When people collect new stamps and save them, the post office
gets its quarter but doesn't have to perform any service for the
money.
   That's the kind of business most companies would love to have,
and one the post office is happy to encourage.
   It should please non-collectors, too, since the profits from
stamps sold to collectors _ philatelists is the formal term _ helps
subsidize the postal service and thus lowers the costs to people
who use stamps to get letters delivered somewhere.
   Since stamps were first issued in the mid-1800s, the postal
service has enjoyed the fact that people collect stamps,
occasionally seeing a boost when some collector became famous, such
as President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   But only in recent years has it studied them and sought to
increase the market.
   Who collects stamps?
   Well, 75 percent of youngsters have a collection of some type,
said Mary Margaret Grant, manager of philatelic services at the
postal service.
   As youngsters enter their teens they find other interests, Ms.
Grant said, and the stamp collection usually gets put aside until
later in life when they marry, have families, and often get
interested in stamps again.
   It was the nostalgic folks returning to collecting that made
last year's carousel stamps big sellers, Morison said.
   This returning group is about half ``casual'' collectors, who
buy stamps they like from time to time, but don't make a big deal
out of it. One-fourth are ``accumulators'' who have some stamps,
often ripping used ones off envelopes. And the rest are serious
collectors, buying whole sheets of stamps, subscribing to stamp
publications and following the hobby closely.
   The serious collectors lobby the agency for stamps, but Ms.
Grant said officials seek to please all types of collectors.
   One thing they have in common is that everybody likes pretty
stamps, Morison said, although serious collectors lean toward more
formal engravings while casual collectors seem to prefer more
colorful productions.
   Much of the recent marketing efforts is aimed at converting
casual collectors to serious ones _ explaining how to mount stamps
in albums, organize them by theme and so forth.
   To do this Morison has instituted a quarterly series of ``stamp
packs'' including a brochure and all of the colorful commemorative
stamps issued over three months.
   Previously, sets of stamps were issued just once a year, but the
stamp packs four times annually help spread out the interest,
Morison said.
   In addition, the agency has subscription services for stamp
collectors to make sure they get all the new stamps that come out.
   There are 38,000 Benjamin Franklin Stamp Clubs for youngsters
around the country, encouraged by the postal service as a means of
getting youngsters interested in stamp collecting.
   Meanwhile, Morison has branched out postal marketing in other
areas, too, promoting the sale of stamps in shopping malls and
supermarkets, for example. Those sales have grown to $500 million,
and ``the public just loves it,'' he said.
   People find it more convenient to buy stamps in supermarkets, he
explained, and this also shortens the lines at post offices,
improving service for people who need help from clerks.
   Shopping mall operations are being planned where people can
``shop and ship,'' Morison added.
   Similar to the postal substations run by many small town stores,
these operations would allow shoppers to buy something at a store,
have it wrapped, and then take it to a counter in the mall for
mailing to a friend or relative without having to make a special
trip to a post office.

<HEAD>Historians on Nixon's Resignation: It Hurt, But Ultimately Helped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen years after Richard M. Nixon resigned
as president to avoid the disgrace of removal from office,
historians and political observers say the republic paid a price
but ultimately benefited from the ordeal.
   And, they say, the impact of Nixon's crisis has been felt by
every president who followed him; chief executives since Nixon have
been more cautious, candid and constrained.
   Washington lawyer Philip W. Buchen, who served as an adviser to
Nixon's successor, Gerald R. Ford, says that in retrospect Nixon's
resignation was ``wholesome.''
   Political scientist Colin Campbell, author of ``Managing the
Presidency,'' says the experience left Nixon's successors ``pretty
skittish for a while.'' He thinks Jimmy Carter, for one,
overreacted and was too weak.
   Historian Richard S. Kirkendall of the University of Washington
says that while the event damaged the presidency, ``it would have
left us with more serious problems if Nixon had been able to get
away with it.''
   Political scientist Jim Reichley of the Brookings Institution
says the founding fathers ``pretty clearly expected that the
impeachment process would be used more often than it has.'' He says
Congress ``has been intruding on executive functions'' since it
found the strength in 1974 to move toward the removal of a
president.
   A dissent comes, however, from Bob Hartmann, who served as White
House counselor to Ford. He says the near-impeachment of Nixon was
unforunate. ``There are other political remedies which are more
routine and which can make presidents toe the mark and put the fear
of God in them if they're over-reaching,'' Hartmann contends.
   Congress, for instance, can deny funds for presidential
projects. ``Congress can so fix his clock that he can't do
anything,'' Hartmann says.
   Buchen, however, says Nixon's continued tenure in office ``was
having an adverse effect on the morale of the country and its
status around the world. It could have led to a threatening
international incident. We did not have a president who was
actively governing.'' Nixon, he says, was concerned solely with his
own survival that summer 15 years ago.
   On the night of Aug. 8, 1974, a few days after the House
Judiciary Committee had recommended impeachment, Nixon went on
television to announce that he would resign, becoming the first and
only president to have done so. He said he no longer had ``a strong
enough political base in Congress'' to carry out the duties of
office.
   Three days earlier, he had surrendered the ``smoking gun''
Watergate tape. It revealed that within a week of the break-in at
Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate in 1972, he had
ordered an end to the FBI's investigation. Whatever remaining
support Nixon had in Congress collapsed.
   The morning after Nixon's speech, he resigned in a letter to the
secretary of state, and Vice President Ford took the oath. ``Our
Constitution works,'' the new president said. ``Our great republic
is a government of laws and not of men.''
   With the passage of time, a sampling of historians and political
observers shows agreement with Ford's assessment and these two
points:
   _Under the circumstances, Nixon's resignation was healthy for
the country.
   _The impact on Nixon's successors has been to curtail
presidential adventurism, to check the strong-president,
weak-Congress trend that started with Franklin D. Roosevelt and to
promote presidential candor and accountability.
   ``I think the initial effect was to make presidents much more
sensitive to the concerns of the public,'' said Buchen, the ex-Ford
adviser. ``That was true of Ford and Carter. It began to slip at
the end of the Reagan administration or we wouldn't have had the
Iran-Contra affair.''
   But even in the Iran-Contra affair, noted Thomas E. Mann,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, the
record shows that Reagan's people used the word ``impeachment''
when discussing the possible consequences of Oliver North's secret
Contra-funding activities.
   It is important that they were sensitive to the possibility of
impeachment, Mann said, adding: ``The legacy of Nixon assures us
that some warning signals are present for successive presidents.''
   ``Even a strong president like Reagan found himself
substantially constrained by an active Congres and a whole new set
of statutes restricting presidential power,'' he said.
   Watergate resulted in laws in these areas _ freedom of
information, limits on presidential war-making powers and a
president's ability to impound funds appropriated by Congress, and
limits on campaign contributions.
   Campbell, a Georgetown University political scientist, said he
finds it ``almost alarming that it came to the point that we almost
had to do the same thing with Ronald Reagan.''
   He said the president's age, his popularity and his nearness to
finishing his term saved Reagan from an impeachment attempt, but he
finds Reagan's escape worrisome, ``very seriously damaging to the
fiber of the republic.''
   Austin Ranney, chairman of the political science department at
the University of California at Berkeley, said the difference
between Watergate and Iran-Contra is that Nixon knew what was
happening while Reagan ``always denied that he knew what was going
on.''
   As for whether the Nixon experience was good for the country,
Ranney said it is never good to have a law-breaking president ``but
it was a wonderful thing that our system of justice and separation
of powers worked to remove a president without an assassination or
violence of any kind.''
   With the exception of Hartmann _ who said ``we will never know''
_ the experts interviewed agreed Nixon could not have avoided
removal from office had he not resigned.
   At the time he quit, every member of the House Judiciary
Committee had announced support for his impeachment by the House
and even such staunch supporters as Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz.,
had warned Nixon he could not win in a trial by the Senate.
   ``People had had it with Nixon and were finally ready to listen
to the evidence,'' said Campbell.
   ``There's no question he would have been impeached by the House
and the Senate would have convicted him,'' said Ranney.
   Kirkendall said President Bush's conduct in office shows that
Bush has learned Watergate's lesson. He noted Bush consults
conspicuously with congressional leaders and allies before making
major moves. ``He makes a big thing of it,'' he said.
   Ranney said Bush and others have learned ``that you can't get
away with anything. Sooner or later, truth will out. And the truth
shows that if you violated the law, you will take the
consequences.''

<HEAD>Corbin Bernsen Stars in World War II Thriller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corbin Bernsen was looking for a new acting
experience when he accepted the lead role in the mind-bending
thriller ``Breaking Point'' on cable television.
   He plays a World War II American intelligence officer whose
capture just weeks before D-Day gives the Nazis an opportunity to
pry out the invasion secrets in a most diabolical and deceptive
manner.
   ``Breaking Point'' gets its first showing on Turner Network
Television on Friday and will be repeated Saturday and Sunday. It's
a remake of the 1964 film starring James Garner.
   ``I did it like an Alfred Hitchcock movie or something from the
`Twilight Zone,''' says Bernsen, who stars regularly as lawyer
Arnie Becker on NBC's ``L.A. Law.''
   ``That's what drew me to it. I've always wanted to do something
in that genre. Since it's for cable we took risks. The wonderful
thing is that after it's approved they leave the artists alone to
do their work. It's not as pat as regular television. The
experience was that of doing a feature film. I wanted to experience
what my character feels, the pain, the torture, the freedom, and to
be able to have the audience feel it, too.''
   He plays Maj. Jefferson Pike, who is abducted by the Germans,
tortured briefly and wakes to find the war is over and he's in an
American hospital. Or so he's led to believe. It's a plot to learn
the secrets of D-Day. John Glover is the ``American'' doctor and
Joanna Pacula is the nurse he falls in love with after being told
his wife has died.
   ``We filmed the exteriors at Lake Tahoe. There's a wonderful old
school and a retreat that looks like an Alpine chalet. When I first
read the script I said, `Great, England and Germany. I can take my
son to meet his grandparents,''' said Bernsen, whose wife is
English actress Amanda Pays.
   ``Well, we filmed England in Pasadena and Germany at Lake Tahoe.
Peter Markle directed, and it has some interesting camera work.
John Glover and I had a great relationship and I think our scenes
are well written and work well. Pike's led to believe the war's
over and he talks about the coming invasion of Normandy. Then he
finds out he's been deceived and he hatches his own deception.''
   Bernsen did get to Europe, however. He and his wife spent a
month traveling with their four-month-old son Oliver.
   ``Breaking Point'' is Bernsen's first movie for cable. His
feature film work in a busy schedule in the past few years included
``Major League,'' ``Disorganized Crime,'' ``Bert Rigby, You're a
Fool'' and ``Hello, Again.''
   Bernsen said he would talk soon to the producers of ``L.A. Law''
to see what would happen to Arnie Becker next season.
   ``I know what needs to be done,'' he said. ``He needs some
re-evaluation. Arnie hasn't quite figured it out. All life has to
reproduce but Arnie's caught in a cycle of refusing to commit
himself. He hasn't grown up enough to accept the moral conventions.
The thing that I put into Arnie is that he senses something is
missing. I don't think I could play a character who doesn't
recognize it.
   ``I think Arnie is terrified of marriage. As a divorce lawyer he
knows all the built-in problems. I think he also sees it as a
progression toward death. He's trying to hold onto his youth.''
   He said one of the advantages of doing ``Breaking Point'' is
that Pike is so different from Arnie.
   ``It's good to do a character who has his values and his
loyalties straight,'' he said. ``After `L.A. Law,' I'd like to do
more features. I'll have had seven years of a family and a house
and a base. I think it'd be fun to live and work other places in
the world. I'd like to base myself in Europe for a while. I could
travel and spend time with my wife and son.''
   Bernsen grew up in Los Angeles. His father, Harry Bernsen is a
former agent and now a producer. His mother, actress Jeanne Cooper,
has been on the CBS soap opera ``The Young and the Restless'' for
the past 15 years.
   He said he occasionally works with his father in developing
projects. ``I'm working on an idea for a stage musical and I have
an idea for a series for Amanda and myself.''

<TEXT>
   It is not uncommon for Roy Cooper, the
eight-time world champion calf roper, to have a Lear jet waiting _
motor running _ to take him from rodeo to rodeo.
   ``No one has an earthly idea what it's like to rope at Pecos,
Texas, at 8 a.m., Prescott (Ariz.) at 2 p.m., Greeley (Colo.) at 9
p.m. and the next morning at Springdale (Ark.),'' said the
33-year-old guru of calf ropers while competing at the 93rd annual
Cheyenne Frontier Days in late July.
   He wasn't complaining. He was reveling.
   ``I'm the second man to win over a million dollars in my
career,'' said the cowboy from Childress, Texas, flashing a
cereal-box smile and spitting a wad of chew.
   ``I'm a first-class cowboy. I want it good all the time. I like
good horses, pretty women and old whiskey.''
   And with little effort, he gets all three.
   But to the vast majority of cowboys on the professional rodeo
circuit, life is an old pickup truck, an ace bandage and a cold
beer to wash the trail dust down.
   ``We sleep in the back seat of the pickup, mostly,'' said steer
wrestler John Thompson, 27, who grew up on a ranch in San Luis
Obispo, Calif. ``There's lots of times you just want to be home.''
   Thompson is traveling the circuit with three cowboys from
Montana. The week before Cheyenne's ``Daddy of `Em All,'' the group
had competed at Salt Lake City and Ogden, Utah, and Nampa, Idaho.
With a 6.5-second time early in the week at Cheyenne, Thompson
qualified for the Sunday finals.
   But there was no time for rest in the Cowboy State while waiting
for the finals. By the end of the week, he had competed in rodeos
in Helena, Great Falls and Glasglow, Mont., before returning to
Cheyenne.
   ``There's a misconception of rodeo cowboys. Everybody thinks we
drink a lot and raise a lot of heck,'' he said, while feeding his
horse, Bill. ``It's not that way anymore. We go to too many rodeos.
We spend more time traveling than anything.''
   Last year, Thompson's second year of professional rodeo, the Top
20 bull dogger entered 123 rodeos in a 270-day stretch, all the
while nursing a wounded shoulder.
   ``You have to have some mental preparation,'' he said. ``You
have to fool yourself and say `I feel good, I'm not tired' when you
are tired and you don't feel good.''
   He does it for one reason _ to get to the National Finals Rodeo
held each year in Las Vegas. Only the top 15 in each event qualify
for the finals. Last year, Thompson was 16th.
   ``If someone asked me that day if I wanted to go to a rodeo, I
would have slugged him,'' he said. ``It's hard to put that effort
out and not qualify.''
   For weekend cowboys, however, the pressure to win is not as
intense because the financial security of a working ranch back home
keeps them afloat.
   ``I've got the best of both,'' said 67-year-old calf roper Bud
Tillard, who owns a sheep ranch in Douglas, Wyo. ``We can go home
and rest up. And it's just fine to participate once in a while.''
   Tillard has been roping since he entered competitions at the
Wyoming State Fair when he was 6. Sixty-one years later, he has two
sons who rope, often in the same rodeos, and grandchildren who are
already roping haystacks.
   Tillard says he's happy with his life and never considered
trading it for that of a full-time cowboy.
   ``All they've got on their mind is roping. I'm calling home and
saying, `Did they get the hay in?''' he said, leaning against a
corral while awaiting his turn to compete. ``Those guys get to
traveling night and day. They forget they've got a wife and pretty
soon they've got another one.''
   For many, roping becomes an addiction and priorities are left in
the dust.
   ``I know cowboys who have roped their ranch away,'' Tillard
said. ``It gets pretty desperate sometimes. These guys don't have
any money and they go on the road. They win a little, and by the
end of the year they're broke.''
   But for rookie Dano Spradlin from Buffalo Creek, Colo., the life
of a cowboy is the life of Roy Cooper, who, incidently, is writing
a book tentatively titled ``Fast Times or Victim of Success.''
   ``It's a kind of an unexplained desire,'' said the 26-year-old
who has been on the back of only 18 bucking saddle broncs. ``My
parents are kind of against it. They think the sport is history.''
   Spradlin wrapped a bandage around his midsection, favoring a
back injury from a bad ride, before his last ride at Cheyenne.
   ``You think about riding correctly, being strong, getting
psyched up _ like a boxer would,'' he said. ``You think about
winning, but most of all, staying on.''
   The young cowboy was bucked off both saddle broncs in the
Cheyenne competition.
   ``It's discouraging enough to make you want to get on again,''
he said. ``A lot of guys get a real nice buckle and lots of money _
I'm just doing it for a good time. I got the fever.''

<HEAD>Congress Considering New Flexibility for Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As lawmakers turn their attention to drafting
a new farm bill, one of the most widely discussed topics on Capitol
Hill is giving more ``flexibility'' to farmers.
   It's an idea that Republicans and Democrats seem to agree on _
at least in principle _ and one that could prove especially
alluring to a Congress seeking ways to cut federal spending.
   ``The truth is, our farmers need to be able to produce according
to farm income, consumer needs and environmental concerns rather
than demands from Washington,'' Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden recently
told a congressional committee.
   Although many in agriculture share that goal, there is certainly
no consensus on how to accomplish it.
   From the farmer's standpoint, the problem is vexing.
   Producers have long complained that government commodity
programs largely prevent them from varying their cropping plans,
whether it's to take advantage of market demands for a commodity or
to experiment with non-traditional crops.
   Under current programs, farmers have a ``base acreage'' for
traditional crops such as wheat and feed grains that qualify for
federal subsidies. Farmers risk reducing that base and the
potential for federal subsidies in future years if they substitute
another commodity on some of that land.
   In the simplest form, proposals for greater flexibility would
merely allow farmers to substitute crops on some of their base
acres without any risk of a reduction in future federal farm
payments.
   Lawmakers took a step in that direction in a drought relief
package passed by the House. The measure would allow farmers to
plant up to 20 percent of their permitted acreage with alternative
crops, including sunflowers, canola, rapeseed and crambe.
   But in the early debate over the 1990 farm bill, more extensive
proposals have been suggested.
   One of the most prominent is called the ``triple base'' plan.
   ``The idea of paying farmers on a reduced percentage of the land
they usually plant _ their crop acreage bases _ has at least two
major attractions for policy-makers,'' concluded a report by the
Congressional Research Service. ``It would help shrink government
spending on agriculture, but, unlike lower target prices, the
reduction would not necessarily amount to a dollar-for-dollar cut
in farm income, as farmers would still be able to raise other crops
on their unpaid permitted acres.''
   Under a triple base plan, farmers would continue to have an
overall acreage base if they participated in government commodity
programs, such as for wheat or corn.
   As with current programs, a percentage of land must be taken out
of production each year in order to receive government price and
income supports. The new twist, however, is that a percentage of a
farmer's overall base acreage could be planted in other crops that
would not be eligible for federal subsidies.
   Consider the example of a farmer with a wheat base of 100 acres.
The government could require the producer to idle or set aside 10
percent for conservation purposes _ the first base. The government
would pay subsidies for a portion of the acres, 80 percent, for
instance _ the second base. On the remainder _ the third base _ the
producer could grow a crop to sell on the open market.
   Proponents say that although farmers would receive smaller
government subsidy payments than under current programs, they could
partially offset those reductions by selling crops on the market
from the ``third base'' acres.
   ``USDA would be able to demonstrate budget savings, just as
though target prices had been reduced, but farmers presumably would
not suffer the same loss in income,'' the study said.
   Target prices are a government-fixed rate that helps determine
the amount of direct income supports received by farmers.
   However, a number of farm groups have voiced opposition to the
triple-base plan. Critics say it is not sound agricultural policy
but just an indirect way for lawmakers to cut farm-support
spending. Commodity groups also have argued that not all farmers
can profitably grow more than one crop and they express doubts that
the triple-base option would do much to encourage producers to
raise crops that are in short supply, such as oats currently.
   A study earlier this year by the Food and Agricultural Policy
Research Institute, a group associated with Iowa State University
and the University of Missouri, found that with each $1 drop in
government spending under a triple-base plan, farmers would suffer
an 85- to 90-cent drop in ``net returns.''
   Hayden has recommended a different approach _ called a ``total
farm base'' program _ but one aimed at the same flexibility goal.
Under it, the total acreage bases of all crops subject to
government commodity programs would be counted together for each
farmer.
   A farmer would be required to idle a portion of the total farm
base, which would provide the government with a tool to continue to
control overall production, but then could plant any mix of crops.
   ``If our farmers had flexibility ... to plant and produce for
the market instead of for government programs, we'd all be better
served,'' says Hayden.

   ``Salaam Bombay!'' (Virgin Vision, Inc., English subtitles.
VHS-Beta, $79.95)
   
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is a heartrending look at the homeless street
children of Bombay, India. But its meanings and nuances transcend
that exotic locale.
   The film, which won a number of international film awards in
1988, is a riveting portrayal of how 20th century societies,
including so-called civilized ones, are devouring their young,
alternately selling them, or selling them short.
   Producer-director Mira Nair traveled the streets of Bombay,
fascinated by the resilience of the thousands of children who
survive by their wits in a squalid world of dirt, drugs and
prostitution.
   She decided to tell their story, not with actors, but with
children she gathered from those very backstreets.
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is the story of 10-year-old Krishna.
Abandoned first by his mother, then by the traveling circus he
joins, he travels to Bombay hoping to earn 500 rupees to take back
to his mother.
   Krishna acquires street wisdom and a toughness that even leads
to a murder. But somehow, almost miraculously, he keeps a
child-like empathy even as he is failing in his own hopes. He
befriends a desperate drug addict, and comforts an abject
16-year-old sold by her own mother to a brothel.
   The film's producers decided to use proceeds to establish
learning centers for the street children of Bombay and Delhi.
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is not rated. It has no objectionable
language or sexual encounters, but the themes of street life are
nonetheless unvarnished.
   It is a truly exceptional film.

   ``Crusoe'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG-13.)
   
   ``Crusoe,'' based on the tale of a shipwreck on a tropical
island, is a lush and aesthetically pleasing movie, and as ripe
with moral dilemmas as the burdened coconut trees swaying on the
beach.
   In ``Crusoe,'' values come crashing down and savagely splinter
the beliefs of the movie's star, Aidan Quinn.
   Quinn plays a greedy young 19th-century slave trader who tempts
fate by taking one final and risky expedition to round up more
blacks from Africa. But his ship becomes ensnared in a vicious
autumn storm and all aboard perish, except for Quinn, who winds up
sprawled on a desolate beach.
   Crusoe learns to endure the solitude and fashions a comfortable
shelter for himself on the picturesque island.
   Before long his isolation is interrupted by visiting natives. He
rescues one from a human sacrifice and decides to keep him as a
slave. But the native later escapes and is killed.
   In a provocative twist, Crusoe becomes the hunted and is trapped
by another islander. But the two men reach an accord and build
something of a friendship.
   The film's ending is the final test of Crusoe's new respect for
the man he once wanted to enslave.
   Director Caleb Deschanel so effectively captures the panoramic
beauty of the island setting _ with its creamy white sand beaches,
dense verdant forests and crystal blue tide pools _ one can almost
taste the salt spray in the breeze.
   There also is very little dialogue, but the engrossing visuals
and the moral struggles make for compelling viewing.

   ``Thrilled to Death'' (Republic. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   B-movie fans, beware. ``Thrilled to Death'' is an A, as in
absolutely awful.
   The script is bad, the acting terrible and even the filming is
poor with washed-out colors and fuzziness.
   It's a movie that uses the backdrop of a swingers' club to
unravel a tale of murder and drug dealing. Along the way, there's
some nudity, strong language and graphic violence.
   Two couples meet and become friends. But one couple has set up
the other to take a fall in a drug-and-murder doublecross.
   Cliff Bahner and Rebecca Lynn play a mystery novelist and his
wife; Richard Maris and Christine Moore are the bad guys.

   When Peter Falk filmed scenes for his new
movie ``Cookie'' at Sing Sing, it marked a sentimental return.
   Not that he was ever a guest at the legendary slammer. He grew
up in Ossining, N.Y.
   ``Yeah, I remember Sing Sing,'' he reflected. ``As a kid, I used
to go into the prison because the town's basketball team played the
prisoners. A lot of the kids I went to school with, their fathers
were guards there.
   ``Whenever you mentioned to people that you came from Ossining,
they always had the same question: Do the lights go out when they
electrocute somebody? Of course the lights never dimmed. You were
not aware of the prison as an ominous thing.
   ``The major memory about Sing Sing had to do with the one big
escape when I was in high school. Three guys broke out and went
down to the river by the railroad station and got ahold of a boat.
One local cop was shot on the way down, and one of the convicts was
shot. They actually rowed across the Hudson, and they were picked
up on the Palisades across the way. That was a big thing.''
   In the new Warner Bros. release, ``Cookie,'' Falk is mobster
Dino Capino who is about to be sprung after 13 years in Sing Sing.
His teen-age daughter, played with amazing skill by English actress
Emily Lloyd, comes to visit him. She is resentful, since he hasn't
married her mother (Dianne Wiest). He already has a wife (Brenda
Vaccaro). As you might guess, ``Cookie'' is not ``The Godfather
III.''
   After his long service as TV's slovenly gumshoe, Columbo, Falk
is on the other side of the law. That's were he started in movies.
   ``It was nice being a mob guy again,'' he remarked. ``It was
nice looking good, too. Great suits they gave me. Did I look good?
I thought I did.'' However, he would brook no criticism of his
Columbo raincoat, which is still in action after 18 years.
   ``You know my first picture was `Murder, Incorporated' in 1960?
I made a little splash in that,'' he said. ``I played Abie Reles,
who was part of that Jewish mob that operated out of Brooklyn at
that time. They were the first ones who hired themselves out to
kill people. They were all quite crazy. Abie was probably the
craziest.
   ``Those mob guys when they saw that picture, they went for it.
They liked me. They came around, and I spent some time with them. I
had a real interest in those guys _ I think everybody does.
   ``I remember going around with some cops in New York. They were
mostly involved in drug cases, but they also had some wire taps of
mob guys. I wanna tell ya, if I had those tapes here and could play
'em for ya, you'd roll on the floor. There are no funnier
conversations I ever heard in my life.''
   Peter Falk may sound like a street guy, but he has a bachelor's
degree in political science from the New School of Social Research
in New York. He was studying for his master's at Syracuse
University when he dropped out to try acting.
   ``When I started out, I was 25-26 years old in off-Broadway in
New York,'' he said. ``Like most actors I knew at that time, we all
wanted the same thing: to be in the Actors Studio. We thought that
was heaven on Earth.
   ``I never thought about being in movies, I never thought about
being in television. I just wanted to be a stage actor. I remember
this agent _ I've told the story before _ the guy said to me, `You
know, you won't be able to do TV or movies.' I don't know why, but
that didn't make any difference to me. Because I had never
considered doing TV or movies.
   ``I asked what he was talking about, and he said, `Your glass
eye.''' Falk lost his eye when he was 3. He won an Academy
nomination for his supporting performance in ``Murder,
Incorporated,'' and he has been working in films and television
ever since.
   Falk won three Emmy awards for his portrayal of Lt. Columbo
during its 1971-1977 run on NBC. Last season, ABC installed
``Columbo'' as part of its ``ABC Mystery Movie,'' much to Falk's
delight. The show has been renewed for 1989-90, and he hopes to
play the role for years to come.
   ``I'll play him as long as the people want to see him,'' he
said. ``I think it would terrific to grow old as Columbo. If
Columbo really can't hear (chuckling) ... and Columbo really can't
see (more chuckles) ... and he gets to the point where it takes him
an hour to get into the office. I think that would be hilarious.
   ``I'd like to see him saying, `What's my name?' (laughing) `Did
you murder someone?' `What case IS this? I gotta call the office
and find out.'''

   ``The Floating World,'' Cynthia Kadohata's first
novel, is best read on a window seat of a Greyhound bus. Names and
places speed by. Friendships form quickly. Departures come with
little warning.
   Through Olivia, the book's young narrator, Kadohata evokes a
life of gas stations and motels, wrecked cars and part-time jobs. A
world where a marriage of 10 years is treated with disbelief and
some disdain, where no place is like home.
   ``Sometimes when I'm on a Greyhound bus I think this is where I
belong,'' the author explained. ``I've never spent a year somewhere
and said, `This is it.' I haven't really got off that bus, but I'd
like to.''
   As a child, Kadohata was shocked to learn that her classmates
had assigned bedtimes. There were few rules in her house, little
routine at all.
   She was born in Chicago, but soon lived in Arkansas and Georgia.
By age nine, her parents were divorced and she had returned to
Chicago with her mother, sister and brother. Kadohata now lives in
Manhattan, but feels restless, suspicious of setting down roots.
   ``The Floating World'' ($17.95, Viking) is not autobiographical,
Kadohata insists, despite the book's story of Olivia's experiences
as she moves across the country during the 1950s and '60s. What
``The Floating World'' does capture, however, is the feelings
brought on by constant upheaval.
   ``Even today I sometimes feel I don't know where I belong,'' the
author said. ``Too bad. A lot of times I would like having a
feeling of belonging but I like traveling, too.''
   She writes from the perspective of a second-generation
Japanese-American whose father was interned in prison camp during
World War II, and who learned quickly how fragile the allegiances
of family and neighborhood could be.
   ``It was really upsetting,'' she said of her father's
experience. ``The thing is that I know it will never happen to me.
Yet because it happened to my father, I'm less sure of my place in
the world.''
   Kadohata first wanted to be a journalist, but a few years after
graduating from college she began writing short stories. She's been
published in The New Yorker, Grand Street and The Pennsylvania
Review.
   ``With fiction, you can change the facts to reveal a larger
truth; that's the root of fiction. That's the problem I have with
nonfiction. I would be so tempted to tell a lie because it would
tell the story better. That's what makes nonfiction so great, too _
all the tension.''
   At the start of World War II, when Japan was the United States'
bitter enemy, Olivia's grandparents are forced to give their
children American names such as Roger, Lily, Laura Ann. The
tradition is passed on to Olivia and her siblings _ Ben, Walker and
Peter.
   ``When I read on the cover of Time magazine, `Are the Japanese
being unfair?,' I kind of think people are going to be mad at me,''
Kadohata said.
   ``I do have that sort of identification. It's hard because I
look Japanese, whereas somebody whose parents came over from Italy,
no one would think of ascociating him that closely with Italy.''
   Kadohata's infuences, however, are profoundly American. She
draws on the Southern writer William Faulkner's feelings of
restlessness and chaos, and uses the spare language of Raymond
Carver and Bobbie Ann Mason.
   And, like Faulkner, she is fascinated with the blurring of myth
and reality. As Olivia rides through Oklahoma, a hitchhiker appears
and quickly vanishes. Kadohata also writes of an encounter between
Olivia and a friend of her stepfather's:
   ```See my house?' he said. `It's an illusion, it's not really
there.'
   ``I looked at the house. Surrounded by dark and trees and below
an orange-ringed moon, it did not seem quite real. That's what I
thought he meant.''
   The author explained: ``I wanted some things to be fantastical.
That's a lot like me. I daydream a lot. It's kind of like the
saying about magic, it's true if you believe it and it's not true
if you don't believe it.''
   After Olivia, the narrator of ``The Floating World,'' graduates
from high school, she moves to California, which had a mythic hold
on Kadohata and many Americans as the symbol of a better life.
   ``When we first moved there,'' she recalled, ``we were in a
truck with my mother's boyfriend and we had driven across country.
I looked at all these little houses and I was just heartbroken. It
wasn't what I expected. I expected to think it was a promised
land.''
   She first called the book ``Seven Moons,'' wanting to use the
phases of the moon to mark the passage of time.
   ``I was going to put the moon in all over. Maybe it's just
continuity. I just wanted to describe the moon,'' she said.
``That's why I love traveling, taking the bus. I like to look at
the landscape.''

   Twenty-two years after they began, 14 years
after they broke off and 20 years after they played at Woodstock,
Ten Years After is back together.
   A Chrysalis album, ``About Time,'' will be released in August,
15 years after their last one, and a seven-week fall U.S. tour is
planned. The quartet, one of the major bands to emerge from the
1960s blues revival in England, known for its fast and furious
blend of blues and medium-heavy rock, has not mellowed out.
   Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee has been performing, while bassist
Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill and drummer Rick Lee have
stayed in music, producing, engineering and managing.
   In an interview with Alvin Lee and Lyons, Lee said that the band
didn't so much split as wind down. ``We'd had some degree of
success and we'd all got nice houses and families. There was a bit
of pressure to stay at home.''
   He said that before Ten Years After split, ``Critics said I was
a fast, tasteless guitar player. That was bothering me a bit. I
shouldn't have let it, now I realize.''
   So he put together the seven-piece In Flight. ``Critics said it
was wonderful and I was playing better than ever. I missed the roar
of the crowd and the loudness after a while. That band wasn't
capable of playing heavy rock. I went back to playing from my blues
and rock roots.'' He formed Ten Years Later for a year, then Alvin
Lee and Company, which played some Ten Years After favorites.
   ``When we played together last summer, suddenly it sounded like
Ten Years After, right from the first note. It was obvious Ten
Years After had its own sound,'' Lee said.
   Reception at the festivals was so enthusiastic, Lyons said, that
the four decided to stay together. Lee and Lyons, each working with
other people, wrote 40 songs. The band recorded 15. Unable to
decide on 10, they put 11 on ``About Time.''
   In July, Ten Years After played before 80,000 in East Berlin.
   Asked about Woodstock, which took place 20 years ago on a farm
in Bethel, N.Y., on Aug. 15, 16 and 17, Lyons says, ``It's all a
bit hazy now, to be honest.''
   Still, memories come back.
   ``We were set to go on and a thunderstorm appeared,'' Lee said.
``Nobody could play for two or three hours. Sparks were flying on
the stage. I thought it outdid the music by far. God's light show.
   ``In a way it was fortunate. I went for a walk around the lake
and joined in with the audience. Nobody knew I was one of the
musicians. Half a million people can't all run under trees. They
sat there and started singing. People were playing on mud slides.
It was a wonderful thing to see that happening. Everybody was
making the best out of the ridiculous sitation. I think it brought
the best out of everybody.
   ``People were offering food and drink. It was very idealistic,
very nice. I think had it not been for the storm, probably I would
never have seen much.
   ``One of the reasons I went out was because in the backstage
area there wasn't a single cigarette. I came back with 10 marijuana
cigarettes, no regular cigarettes.''
   Lyons said, ``They said the food backstage was spiked with acid.
Whether it was true or not, it dims the appetite. The drinks were
supposed to be dodgy. In those days you never used to drink from an
open can anyhow.''
   Neither can remember what Ten Years After played, except for
``I'm Going Home,'' the high-energy rocker used in the
``Woodstock'' movie and, they think, the jazzy ``I Can't Keep From
Crying Sometimes'' and ``Love Like a Man.''
   ``I remember we did `Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl,''' Lyons
said, ``because the tuning went out because of atmospheric
conditions. We had to stop the song, apologize and retune. We did
`Going Home' as an encore.''
   ``We were the first on after the storm,'' Lee recalled.
``Everybody was worried. Sparks were still flying off the stage and
it was very wet. Somebody had to do it. Think how many of our
records would have sold if we'd been electrocuted.
   ``It was definitely the movie that made Woodstock the memorable
thing it was,'' Lee said. ``Toronto was probably as good a festival
as Woodstock. It got forgotten.
   ``We carried on in 3,000 to 5,000-seat halls. A year later the
movie came out and we're into 20,000 seaters.''
   The night before their Woodstock appearance, Ten Years After was
in St. Louis at a jazz festival before a primarily black audience.
   ``Nina Simone went on,'' Lyons said. ``Four white hippies went
on afterwards. When we walked on stage, an uproar was starting. It
was frightening. But we played a bit of jazz and blues and we were
OK then.''
   Lee sais that in one way Woodstock was a statement against
racial prejudice. ``It was even more about the peace movement and
the Vietnam War. We thought the peace movement was very real and a
good thing to be doing. Woodstock tended to make it into a
fashionable thing. The fashion grew old and it was no longer cool
to be a hippie.''
   Lyons added, ``Woodstock was anti-establishment, a peace and
love thing, anti-violence. It was for tolerance, let people do what
they want, help one another. I think it had a lot of long-term
benefits.''
   But they didn't know what Woodstock symbolized before they got
there. Lee said, ``It was just another line on the sheet.''
   They flew from St. Louis to New York and drove until they came
to blocked roads.
   ``They took us in an Army helicopter,'' Lee said. ``I was
hanging out on a safety strap over all the audience. It was a
mind-blowing experience.''

<HEAD>Kodak Blames Restructuring for Second Quarter, Half-Year Earnings

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. says its second-quarter
profits fell 85 percent, mainly the result of a $225 million
restructuring charge that was announced last week.
   Without the special charges, profits still would have dropped 26
percent in the second quarter. The company blames higher costs,
including interest expenses and the impact of the strong dollar.
   Chairman Colby Chandler vowed last week and again Tuesday that
strong steps would be taken to deal with the slump in operating
profits.
   Nevertheless, the stock fell Tuesday. It was off 62{ cents at
$47.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Net earnings were $60 million, or 18 cents a share, down from a
record $390 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose
to a record $4.5 billion from $4.13 billion for the second quarter
last year.
   For the first half, profit fell 60 percent to $260 million, or
80 cents a share, from $650 million, or $2 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose to a record $8.4 billion from $7.46 billion in last
year's first half.
   The one-time charges cover changes that ``have happened, are
happening and will be happening,'' said company spokesman Paul
Allen. He said the changes could involve layoffs, sale of
businesses and discontinuation of products.
   But the company has not released details about its specific
plans.
   ``That's what we're waiting for. There's been nothing concrete
so far,'' said Eugene Glazer, stock analyst for Dean Witter
Reynolds in New York.
   He said the company has already made it clear that the current
restructuring is not going to be major by Wall Street proportions.
   ``It's going to be significant, but not gigantic,'' Glazer said.
``But that leaves the question of whether the company is going to
tighten its belt by one notch, two notches or three.''
   ``While volume gains so far this year have been gratifying,
especially in the United States, our earnings have not kept pace,''
Chandler said.
   Some cost-cutting steps may be taken in the company's
Information Systems business segment, which includes copiers, and
microfilm and graphics equipment.
   For the second quarter that segment posted a $144 million loss,
as compared to a $92 million second-quarter profit last year. Even
without restructuring charges, the segment would only have posted a
profit of $6 million.
   ``There seems to be tremendous pressure there for something to
happen,'' said Glazer.

   AT&amp;T says its ``smart card'' will be used to
allow European motorists to pay tolls without stopping at toll
booths under a marketing agreement with Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp;
Co. SpA.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Tuesday its contract
marked the first time smart card technology developed in the United
States will be marketed in Europe.
   Smart cards, which are popular in Europe and Japan, are the size
of credit cards but contain tiny computer chips. They can be used
as charge cards, dog tags or electronic keys, among other things.
   Drivers approaching a highway toll plaza will slow to about 40
mph and insert their smart cards into transmitters mounted in the
cars, AT&amp;T said. Information stored on the cards will be sent to
the toll station and the cost of each toll will be subtracted from
an account programmed into the card.
   AT&amp;T said it has had discussions with highway and municipal
authorities about selling systems in the United States but has
nothing to announce yet.
   Other companies, including Dallas-based Amtech Corp., offer
devices that allow cars to pay tolls without stopping. But AT&amp;T
said it has the only card whose software allows it to be used for
multiple purposes. For example, the same card could also store car
maintenance records.
   Amtech's system, which uses a plastic TollTag, is in operation
on the North Dallas Tollway. The company is also trying to sell a
system in Oslo, Norway.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Hires Adviser On ESPN Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc., the food and tobacco giant
that has been looking for ways to reduce the debt incurred in its
record buyout deal, says it has hired a financial adviser to help
it decide what to do with its 20 percent stake in ESPN Inc., which
operates a cable sports newtork.
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. owns a controlling 80 percent interest
in ESPN, the nation's largest cable network with 52.4 million
subscribers.
   RJR Nabisco, acquired for $24.5 billion in April by a group led
by the buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., said
Tuesday it had retained Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to advise it on the
ESPN stake.
   ``We have had several inquiries from parties interested in
acquiring our stake in ESPN,'' Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and
chief executive of RJR Nabisco, said in a statement. ``However, we
have not decided whether we will sell our stake. Lazard will help
us evaluate our alternatives.''
   RJR Nabisco is looking for ways to raise cash through asset
sales in an effort to reduce the huge debt incurred in the buyout.
   It has said it intends to sell about $5.5 billion in assets to
reduce debt and has announced about $2.6 billion of such
transactions, mostly the sale of five Nabisco food companies in
Europe.
   Nabisco Brands Inc., an RJR subsidiary, acquired the ESPN stake
for $60 million in 1984 from ABC Video Enterprises. At the time,
Nabisco Brands was beginning to become heavily involved in sports
marketing.
   RJR's new management has indicated it is reviewing the company's
marketing efforts and is likely to reduce its involvement in sports
marketing.
   Some industry analysts questioned whether the ESPN stake would
have any significant value to anyone other than Capital Cities,
because the giant media concern will control ESPN no matter who
owns the minority stake.
   RJR spokesman David Kalish said Capital Cities-ABC has the right
to match any bona fide offer that might be made for the ESPN stake
held by RJR.
   Capital Cities-ABC said it had no comment on RJR's statement.
   ESPN was controlled by Getty Oil Co. when it was launched in
September 1979. ABC Video acquired a 15 percent stake in ESPN in
January 1984 and obtained the remaining 85 percent five months
later from Texaco Inc. after Texaco's acquisition of Getty.
   ESPN's visibility has been rising in recent years. It has been
carrying National Football League telecasts for two years and
acquired in January the rights to telecast 175 regular season Major
League Baseball games a year for four years starting in 1990.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. says it will cut
long-distance rates by about $12 million annually to keep pace with
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s lower rates under new federal
pricing regulations.
   MCI said Tuesday it was lowering its interstate long-distance
rates by an average of 1.5 percent, effective immediately.
   The Federal Communications Commission in April imposed a new
``price cap'' regulatory scheme on AT&amp;T that put limits on what
AT&amp;T can charge for its long-distance services instead of limiting
how much it can earn above its costs.
   The plan went into effect July 1, and AT&amp;T said its customers
would save $140 million immediately.
   MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance provider behind AT&amp;T, said
its own rate reductions ``will ensure that MCI remains competitive
in the wake of the newly implemented price cap regulations.''
   MCI's residential rates will go down by an average of 1.9
percent, business-commercial rates by an average of 0.4 percent and
MCI card usage fees by 1 percent, the company said.
   The No. 3 long-distance company, US Sprint, cut its evening
long-distance rates 25.6 percent effective Tuesday for its new
Sprint Plus calling plan.

<HEAD>House Votes to Increase National Debt Ceiling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has voted to increase the national
debt limit temporarily by $70 billion so the Treasury won't go into
default while Congress is on its summer recess.
   The bill, approved 231-185 Tuesday and sent to the Senate, adds
to the debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion only through Oct. 31. By then,
Congress hopes to complete work on bill boosting the Treasury's
permanent borrowing authority to more than $3.1 trillion.
   The Treasury is already bumping up against the $2.8 trillion
limit and would be unable to meet its obligations by mid-August
without additional power to issue debt. A U.S. government default
would be unprecedented.
   The House passed the short-term debt extension after blocking,
228-193, an attempt by Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., to make
the increase contingent upon House consideration of an amendment to
the Constitution requiring a balanced budget.
   The House actually approved the permanent debt increase when it
passed the fiscal 1990 budget last spring, but the legislation has
been held up in the Senate.
   Several senators plan to use the must-pass legislation to carry
amendments addressing pet priorities, and it could also become the
vehicle for a new deficit-reduction effort by congressional leaders
and the White House.
   The national debt has tripled since the beginning of the decade
due to the huge budget deficits of the Reagan administration. The
Treasury has been forced to borrow more and more money to finance
government spending that exceeds tax receipts.
   The annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over $200
billion a year, but nearly $150 billion in red ink will be added to
the pool this fiscal year.
   The Gramm-Rudman budget law, itself passed as part of a 1985
debt bill that first put the limit above $2 trillion, mandates that
Congress and the president reduce the deficit in fiscal 1990 to
$100 billion.
   Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1. Congress commences its four-week
summer recess this Saturday.
   The short-term debt limit bill approved by the House on Tuesday
also included a provision, requested by the Treasury, to change the
way the government accounts for its zero-coupon bonds when
calculating the debt. The change will lessen the immediate impact
the bonds have on the debt.

<HEAD>Polygram To Acquire Island Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polygram NV, the world's third-largest music
recording company, said Tuesday it agreed to acquire the privately
held Island music group, best known for developing Jamaican reggae
music.
   The price was not disclosed but it was rumored in recording
industry circles to be about $332 million.
   The 27-year-old, London-based Island group was founded and owned
by the Jamaican entrepreneur Chris Blackwell. It consists of the
Island Records Ltd. recording company, music publisher Island Music
Ltd. and Island Visual Arts Ltd., a company that produces music
videos.
   ``Island will continue to operate creatively as an independent
and autonomous group with Chris Blackwell as chief executive,''
David Fine, Polygram's president, said in a statement.
   Island controls recordings by the late reggae singer Bob Marley
plus those of singer Steve Winwood, the Spencer Davis Group and
others.
   It has a stable of well-known popular music artists, including
the Irish rock band U2, as well as artists such as Melissa, Anthrax
and Tom Waits.
   Financial details of the company were not disclosed.
   Also London-based, Polygram's popular artists include Dire
Straits, Elton John and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
   With annual sales of over $1.7 billion, it controls 15 percent
of the international recorded-music market.
   The company is 90 percent owned by the Dutch electronics group
NV Philips. The remaining 10 percent is owned by an institutional
investor that Philips won't identify.
   Polygram was formed in 1962 through the merger of the recording
industry operations of Philips and the West German electronics
group Siemens AG, which pulled out of the venture completely by
1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., the conservative giant of
Japanese industry, says it plans to drop special courtesy titles
for employees and cut in half the number of approvals required for
most decisions.
   The steps are part of a broad plan to make Toyota more flexible
and ``provide every employee the opportunity to work creatively and
to the fullest of his or her ability,'' the company announced
Tuesday.
   Toyota also said it will spend $730 million on bettering
employees' work lives, through new recreational facilities, dining
rooms and company housing for both married and single employees.
   Aspects of Toyota's plan such as more company housing are
strictly Japanese, but the emphasis on employee creativity is
Western.
   While American companies are trying to be more Japanese in
management, the Japanese are trying in some respects to become more
American.
   ``This is in order to have quick decisions and get more ideas,
more energetic work from the staff,'' said Akikazu Kida, a Toyota
spokesman in New York. The changes were also announced in Tokyo.
   To promote workplace democracy, old titles such as kacho
(manager) will be discarded and all employees will be referred to
simply as san, the Japanese equivalent of Mr., Mrs. or Ms.
   Personnel evaluations that have been dominated by seniority will
now take performance more into account, Toyota said. About 1,000
supervisors will be reassigned to creative, hands-on work.
   Toyota is the largest industrial company in Japan and has a
reputation for a slow, conservative management style, in contrast
to more Western-style companies such as Honda Motor Co. Ltd.
   Japanese companies have long succeeded by adapting American
technology and perfecting manufacturing techniques, but corporate
leaders have decided that success in the future will demand
innovation. And innovation requires giving employees freer rein.
American consultants have traveled to Japan to lecture the
industrial giants on such themes as how one person can make a
difference.
   ``Employees will be encouraged to realize their own potential
and pursue their own professional interests,'' Toyota said.

<HEAD>Convictions Could Strengthen Use of Racketeering Statute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<UNK>AP Business Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conviction of six Wall Street professionals
on racketeering charges has intensified debate over whether the
laws passed in 1970 to fight organized crime should be used to
prosecute white-collar crime.
   Legal experts said Tuesday the guilty verdict on 63 of 64 counts
in the Princeton-Newport tax fraud trial strengthens the
government's decision to use the controversial Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations law.
   ``I think the verdict shows the statute can be used successfully
in this area,'' said Gerard Lynch, a criminal law professor at
Columbia University. ``I would have expected it would be used more
anyway and this verdict encourages it.''
   The U.S. District Court trial of five executives of the defunct
investment firm Princeton-Newport Partners LP and a former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. trader was the first time the statute was used
in a securities case.
   Opponents of the law say applies far too stiff penalties for
white-collar criminals _ including a 20-year jail term per count.
They also say its provision for pretrial asset seizures can force
companies out of business before a trial.
   ``I think RICO as originally promulgated by Congress was
excellent. I think it has become grossly overused and abused,''
said securities lawyer Aubrey B. Harwell Jr., who represented a
former Drexel trader in another case stemming from the government's
three-year crackdown on Wall Street crime.
   Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, now running for
New York City mayor, pioneered the new use of RICO _ and, critics
say, threats to use it.
   Giuliani was accused of trying to pressure the Princeton-Newport
defendants to testify against others by charging them with
racketeering. Princeton-Newport has said the charges last August
forced its liquidation shortly thereafter.
   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph has said his firm
agreed in a separate case to pay $650 million and plead guilty to
six securities felonies rather than face a possible RICO indictment.
   Michael Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond
operations, was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud
earlier this year for transactions that included one also cited in
the Princeton-Newport complaint after refusing to enter a plea
agreement.
   A person familiar with his legal preparations said Tuesday the
Princeton-Newport verdict would not affect Milken's plans to fight
the charges.
   But legal experts said Monday's guilty verdict would give
prosecutors a psychological boost as they ready for Milken's
scheduled March 1990 trial. It also could spur more RICO securities
cases.
   ``It certainly would indicate the Department of Justice the
viability of RICO at least before a jury and in a case where tax
seemed to be the overriding concern,'' said Columbia securities law
professor Harvey Goldschmid.
   Justice Department guidelines on RICO state the law should not
be used as a substitute for tax fraud prosecutions. But the
guidelines are flexible, and in the Princeton-Newport case tax
claims were brought instead as mail fraud charges.
   New York attorney Martin Klein, a close friend of Milken's,
argues that the statute should not be used simply to fit the needs
of prosecutors.
   ``It's not a substitute for the securities laws or the tax laws
and it's not to be used as a catchall for every other federal
statute,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, proponents of the law say its broad nature and the
changing nature of crime, in which such frauds as insider trading
have become more common, have made RICO a logical tool to fight any
pattern of criminal activity.
   ``If the RICO statute can be used for three bookmakers standing
on the corner it certainly ought to be used for individuals sitting
in corporate boardrooms stealing massive amounts of money from the
public,'' said Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York State
Organized Crime Task Force.
   Congress is considering two bills that would revamp RICO's use
in civil cases, eliminating its award of triple damages. Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist in May called for imposing
limitations on civil use of RICO.
   Others said RICO's severe potential penalties were inappropriate
for cases such as Princeton-Newport. The jury, lawyers said, may
have convicted the defendants of arranging illegal tax schemes with
or without the RICO charge.
   ``My own view is that it's got to be an extremely aggravated
white-collar case to use the RICO statute,'' said criminal defense
lawyer Robert Morvillo. ``I don't think it was originally designed
for this use. I think it's very heavy-handed.''

<HEAD>Route 128's Woes: A Matter of Style As Well As Substance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every morning, traffic moves at a crawl along
Route 128, the high technology highway ringing Boston. Some
insiders say the pace of business inside the sleek corporate
headquarters along 128 isn't any faster.
   ``Tactical decisions that take six weeks in Boston can take
anywhere from six days to six nanoseconds in California,'' said
Sterling Hager, founder of a public relations firm that represents
computer firms on both coasts.
   After a year of falling profits and employment, many companies
along Route 128 are going through a period of painful retrenchment
and self-examination, and a common conclusion is that they need to
become more agile, less hierarchical and more willing to take risks.
   In the last week, three of the four largest computer makers in
Massachusetts _ Wang Laboratories Inc., Data General Corp. and
Prime Computer Inc. _ announced quarterly losses.
   Prime's troubles have made it a takeover target, and two other
Massachusetts high-tech companies _ Cullinet Software Inc. and
Apollo Computer Inc. _ already have been sold this year. Another
former high flyer, Leading Edge Products Inc., is in bankruptcy.
   All told, high technology manufacturing companies in
Massachusetts have eliminated 7,300 jobs in the past year and
36,100 since their peak in December 1984, the state Department of
Employment and Training says.
   Underlying Route 128's woes are the maturing of the computer
industry, the slowdown in the national economy and the stiff
competition that minicomputer makers face from workstations and
ever more powerful personal computers.
   But those trends do not entirely explain why some Massachusetts
computer firms are still prospering, or why Route 128's West Coast
counterpart, California's Silicon Valley, is generally healthy.
   The substance of Route 128's problem, critics charge, is style:
Boston-area executives in their button-down shirts and brown shoes
are more cautious and slow-moving than their California rivals in
polo shirts and Reeboks.
   ``In Northern California companies, the hierarchy seems
compressed,'' said Hager. ``An account executive in Sunnyvale might
be reporting directly to the president, the CEO or the founder. In
Cambridge, that person will speak to the communications manager,
who works for the VP of you-name-it, who reports to the executive
VP, who whispers to the Main Force.''
   In part, Hager said, the different management styles reflect
cultural or lifestyle differences. In part, they are a matter of
age.
   ``The high-tech superstructure on the West Coast is run and
managed by people in their 30s, and the people who run the
high-tech companies on the East Coast are mainly in their 50s and
60s,'' he said. ``People in their 20s and 30s have no fear _ of
anything.''
   Stephen L. Josselyn, a computer market analyst with
International Data Corp. in Framingham, agrees that decision-making
is slower and product cycles longer along Route 128. ``It's just
harder to get people to move on the East Coast,'' he said.
   Examples abound:
   _Wang, which pioneered the market for word processors, lost
ground when it failed to move quickly into personal computers. It
is now making a big push into document imaging products, but it
announced a $375 million quarterly loss Monday. Some analysts say
the family-controlled company may have to find a substantial
outside investor.
   _Digital Equipment Corp., the state's largest computer maker,
also stuck with proprietary operating systems and failed to
capitalize on the PC explosion. Now it is moving into ``open,'' or
non-proprietary, software. But Digital's earnings have slipped this
year, and it has frozen salaries.
   _Data General also is moving away from proprietary systems
toward open software and reduced instruction set computing _ or
``risc'' _ technology, which simplifies the circuitry of a computer
and allows cost savings. In a two-year restructuring, it has cut
its work force from 16,000 to 14,000, and posted a $23.1 million
loss for the quarter ended June 24.
   Data General spokesman Michael F. Klatman calls the critic's
charges ``baloney.''
   ``From the time management made the decision to commit to open
systems, it took us just nine months to get our first products out
the door,'' he said. ``That's something you never would have seen
in this industry 10 years ago.''
   Klatman and others point out that aside from sales of PCs and
workstations, the entire U.S. computer market is slow.
   Minicomputer makers have been hit particularly hard, squeezed
between mini-supercomputers on the high end and technical
workstations on the low end, said Douglas J. Crook, an analyst with
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
   ``It just so happens, it's an accident of nature, that there are
more minicomputer makers based in Massachusetts, and the
traditional minicomputer is not growing at the rate of other
areas,'' said Klatman.

   The jury that convicted five former officials of
Princeton-Newport Partners LP and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. trader of racketeering charges now must decide how much money
they will have to forfeit to the government.
   The jurors began deliberations on the forfeiture issue Tuesday
after hearing arguments from both sides.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hansen said the defendants should
relinquish salaries and other claims that could total more than $21
million.
   Defense attorneys, who have said they will appeal the
conviction, argued that the forfeiture sought by the government was
excessive and violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual
punishment.
   On Monday, the Manhattan federal court jury convicted the
defendants of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy and
numerous counts of mail and wire fraud.
   The case marked the first time securities professionals were
accused of racketeering under a controversial federal law aimed at
combating mobsters and drug pushers. The Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations law provides for heavy fines and lengthy
prison terms, in addition to forfeiture.
   The trial received widespread attention because it grew
indirectly out of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal that
rocked Wall Street three years ago.
   The largest forfeiture was sought from former Princeton-Newport
partner James Sutton Regan. His partnership interest was placed at
$13.3 million and his salary at $1.75 million.
   From former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg, the government
sought $2.5 million in salary.
   The prosecution asked the jury to require forfeiture for the
other Princeton-Newport defendants as follows: former partner
Charles M. Zarzecki, $1.1 million partnership interest and $267,483
in salary; former partner Jack Z. Rabinowitz, $791,191 partnership
interest and $454,507 in salary; former partner Paul A. Berkman,
$762,613 partnership interest and $558,328 in salary; and former
controller Steven B. Smotrich, $124,583 in salary.
   ``Here's a man who has no money and the government wants him to
forfeit millions and millions of dollars,'' said Regan's attorney,
Theodore Wells. ``I submit to you that is cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   But Hansen told the jury that the racketeering statute permitted
the forfeiture of all interest from an illegal enterprise.
   ``As they chased the almighty dollar, they crossed far past the
line of law,'' Hansen said. ``You must decide whether the
defendants should be stripped of some of their tainted wealth.''
   The case involved a series of pre-arranged stock transactions
from 1984 to 1986. The government alleged during the five-week
trial that the defendants illegally bought and sold stocks to
generate phony tax losses.
   Princeton-Newport went out of business after the indictment was
brought last August. Defense lawyers said at the time that the
charges alone, though unproven, destroyed the securities firm's
ability to do business.
   Besides forfeiture, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison
on each of the two racketeering counts, jail terms ranging from
five to three years for the other charges and fines. A sentencing
date has not been scheduled.
   Before the lawyers presented their arguments to the jury, U.S.
District Judge Robert Carter ruled that the prosecution could not
tell the jury about a $650 million fine Drexel paid to settle
securities law charges in another case, which also stemmed from the
Boesky scandal.
   Defense attorneys had argued that telling jurors about the fine
would prejudice them on the forfeiture question.

   U.S. families are losing at least $607 million
a year because the government hasn't passed legislation
guaranteeing workers unpaid leave to care for young children or
sick parents, a group backing such a law said today.
   ``Year after year, American families are the big losers because
Congress has failed to pass minimum family and medical leave
policies,'' Donna Lenhoff of the Women's Legal Defense Fund said in
prepared remarks. ``Working parents should not have to choose
between having a job and having a family.''
   Legislation is awaiting debate on both the House and Senate
floors that would require employers to provide up to 10 weeks of
unpaid leave over a two-year period to meet family needs during the
birth or adoption of a child and for family medical emergencies.
   ``Unnecessary Losses,'' the report for the Family and Medical
Leave Act Coalition, was based on a 1988 survey of 7,000 families
conducted by the Institute for Social Research at the University of
Michigan.
   The institute compiles data on a broad range of topics annually
and it is then used by researchers who break out and interpret
areas of particular interest to them.
   The analysis said the $607 million in family losses ``represents
the additional earnings lost by new mothers who return to work, but
are unable to return to their former jobs because their employers
don't have parental leave policies in place.''
   ``When these new mothers without job-protected leaves return to
work but are unable to return to their former jobs, they experience
more unemployment and lower wages than those mothers who return
after a period of protected leave,'' the report said.
   Moreover, the report said, taxpayers spend $108 million a year
on government assistance programs that wouldn't be necessary if
there was a nationwide family and medical leave program.
   ``Working mothers without job-protected leave receive $108
million more in assistance from such programs as unemployment
insurance, supplemental security income and welfare than do mothers
working for employers with parental leave policies,'' the report
said.
   ``As Congress prepares to leave for their summer break, we
wanted to remind our nation's lawmakers that American families are
suffering unnecessary losses due to their inaction on family
policies,'' Lenhoff said.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has boosted its daily flights to
350 as part of a plan to emerge from a crippling strike as a leaner
carrier, but unionized pilots say the only thing that has increased
is the danger level.
   The expansion, which began on Tuesday, represents an increase of
nearly 60 percent over last month's schedule. Eastern is now back
to about a third of its pre-strike size.
   ``It's another major step back from the impact of the strike and
the bankruptcy and a very significant phase in the rebuilding of
the airline,'' said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
   But union officials called the schedule expansion an unsafe rush
to return with inexperienced flight crews.
   The Air Line Pilots Association issued a statement saying, ``If
you get past all of the hype and all of the slogans, there is a
level of risk to the flying public never before experienced in the
history of American commercial aviation.''
   ALPA said 75 percent of Eastern's flight crews are unfamiliar
with the type of aircraft they are flying and that Eastern is
violating federal standards by pairing inexperienced pilots.
   ``We are in complete and total compliance with all Federal
Aviation Administration rules,'' Eastern's Matell countered. ``Our
training and procedures are guided by conservatism is all
respects.''
   Matell added the unions have repeatedly used ``safety scares and
smear tactics'' in an effort to hurt Eastern.
   FAA spokesman Jack Barker said Eastern ``is meeting the
recommendation. If there is anything to the contrary, we would like
to know about it.''
   Eastern said the inreased flights went off smoothly, except for
one New York-to-Montreal flight canceled because a catering truck
damaged a plane.
   Also, some passengers in the Atlanta hub, where many of the new
flights were added, complained about long delays.
   ``This is my first time on Eastern in two years _ first and
last,'' said passenger David Parker, who complained that his flight
from Charlotte, N.C. arrived about an hour late. ``My travel agent
talked me into this for the $39 fare.''
   To entice more passengers Eastern offered temporary one-way
fares as low as $39. It also was required to lease several planes
from its sister carrier, Continental Airlines.
   Unable to maintain its pre-strike schedule of nearly 1,100 daily
flights when the strike began March 4, Eastern filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection five days later.
   Last month, the company filed a reorganization plan calling for
Eastern to emerge from bankruptcy by year's end at two-thirds its
previous size. The airline's unions back an alternative buyout
proposal by Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie.
   Eastern said it plans to increase its daily flights to 390 by
Aug. 15. Its goal is 800 daily flights from 77 cities, down from
102 cities before the strike.
   Eastern and Continental are owned by Texas Air Corp. The unions
contend Texas Air wants either to liquidate Eastern or merge it
with predominantly non-union Continental.

<HEAD>GEC and Siemens Reach Agreement With Government Over Plessey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG reached an
agreement with the British government on conditions for resuming
their joint bid for Plessey Co. PLC, the government said Wednesday.
   The British and German electronics giants have pledged to remedy
public interest questions identified by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, the Department of Trade and Industry said in a brief
statement.
   The department in April said GEC and Siemens could renew their
bid for Plessey, also a British electronics company, on the
recommendation of the monopolies commission.
   But the clearance was conditioned upon the companies negotiating
with the department and the Ministry of Defense to ensure there is
no reduction in competition in the British defense electronics
industry.
   Details of the agreement weren't immediately available. But a
department spokesman said there were ``no differences of
substance'' between the measures agreed to by GEC and Siemens and
the recommendations made in the commission's April report.
   Among the commission's chief objections to the original
structure of the Plessey takeover was an accompanying plan for GEC
to acquire a 35 percent stake in Siemens' defense interests. The
commission said it opposed such a stake on the ground it would give
GEC an interest in the Plessey radar and military communications
interests to be acquired by Siemens.
   The original GEC-Siemens offer made earlier this year, valuing
Plessey at $2.8 billion, automatically lapsed when the monopolies
commission launched its inquiry in January.
   A spokesman for GEC refused to say whether the two companies
would renew their bid. ``We are considering with our partners'' on
the next step, said the spokesman, who wasn't identified, in
accordance with British custom.
   Under British takeover regulations, GEC and Siemens have 21 days
in which to re-introduce their bid.
   A Plessey spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.
   GEC is not related to the similarly named American company.

<HEAD>Company President Formally Charged in Sales to East Germany</HEAD>

   The president of a machinery company has been
formally charged with selling East Germany restricted semiconductor
equipment and rare materials that could be used in nuclear reactor
rods, officials said Wednesday.
   Hirokuni Matsuda, president of Prometron Technics Corp., was
charged with violating Japan's trade and foreign exchange control
and custom laws by allegedly selling the items without government
approval, said an official of the Tokyo Metropolitan police, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official declined to discuss further details and prosecutors
were not immediately available for comment.
   Police arrested Matsuda last month for allegedly supplying East
Germany in 1986 and 1987 with more than 20 pounds of hafnium, a
rare material that can be used in nuclear reactor rods.
   Hafnium is on a list of items restricted by the Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Control, or COCOM, a Paris-based
organization that regulates Western trade in strategic items with
the Communist bloc.
   Matsuda also was accused of exporting to East Germany restricted
semiconductor manufacturing equipment valued at $875,000 via South
Korea and China in 1987. That equipment is also on the COCOM list.

   Nissan Motor Corp. says it will price its
Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan at $38,000, putting it in a league with
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus luxury car and just below Europe's most
expensive luxury sedans.
   The Infiniti Q45 is a four-door sedan, equipped with a 4.5
liter, 32-valve, 278-horsepower V8 engine. Its two-door coupe, with
a 3-liter, 162-horsepower V6, will be priced at $23,500, the
company said Tuesday.
   Prices cover all options including leather interior, sunroof,
premium stereo system, anti-lock brakes and automatic temperature
control, said Bill Bruce, Infiniti vice president and general
manager.
   The Infinitis will appear in showrooms Nov. 8.
   Toyota's V8-powered Lexus LS400 four-door luxury sedan is
scheduled for public introduction Sept. 1. It will be priced at
$35,000.
   ``They'll be priced right on each other and slightly below their
German competition,'' said Charles Brady, automotive analyst for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. in New York. ``I think it's a real test for
the Japanese, to see if anybody wants to pay that much for a
Japanese car.''

<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. says it will reduce
the suggested retail price of its older Macintosh SE computers by
$300, and will incorporate a high-capacity floppy disk into all of
the computers.
   ``One of the things which has disturbed us was that the older,
lower-end Macintoshes were starting to slow down. We've just
announced today that the Macintoshes will have a lower price and
will have higher functionality,'' Apple Chairman John Sculley said
Tuesday.
   The Macintosh SE has joined the Macintosh SE-30 and the
Macintosh II line in utilizing the FDHD, short for Floppy Disk High
Density.
   The disk will substantially increase the size of the computers'
memory and will make computer interaction easier.

<HEAD>Apple and Microsoft Pause in Legal Battle To Announce New Product</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILLBRAE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Sculley and Bill Gates, putting
aside for the moment the legal battle between Apple Computer Inc.
and Microsoft Corp., dined peacefully together this week and
announced an ``office on a disc'' for the Apple Macintosh.
   Gates, chairman of Microsoft, quipped that ``the legal
departments aren't friends.'' But he noted that the two companies
remain steadfast allies and share the same vision of the future of
computing.
   Sculley, Apple's chairman, said his appearance at the Microsoft
presentation on Tuesday ``shows that we want to be partners
together in innovation'' despite Apple's ongoing copyright suit
against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Apple and Microsoft are working together ``more now than at any
time in the past,'' Gates said. ``We have decided not to let (the
lawsuit) affect the other things we're doing and let it run its own
course.''
   Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., recently won a round in the
courtroom fight when a federal judge issued a tentative ruling that
would substantially narrow Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple's suit
accusing Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard of stealing the ``look and
feel'' of the Macintosh system.
   ``Microsoft has always been very clear that we don't understand
why Apple brought the lawsuit, and that we expect to win the
lawsuit,'' Gates said. ``I think the recent developments are
consistent with (our) predictions. The case is not over but it was
a very positive milestone.''
   The ``office on a disc'' for the Apple Macintosh consists of a
compact disc containing four of Microsoft's most popular business
programs for the Macintosh _ Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and
Mail _ plus documentation for each, a thesaurus and other items.
   Both companies hope the product will help spur the evolution
from floppy diskettes to compact disks for computers.
   The Microsoft Office collection on disk will be priced at $949
and is expected to be available by the end of September. That is a
one-third discount from what the programs would cost if bought
separately on floppy diskettes.
   Sales of Apple's compact disc drive, which retails for about
$1,200, have been slow so far as businesses await more software for
it.
   ``This is just an introductory technology. I don't expect it to
have a major financial impact,'' said analyst David Bayer of
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ``It's more a demonstration
of capabilities, laying the groundwork for future uses.''

<HEAD>Eisner: New Disney Studio Theme Park to Expand to Handle Large Crowds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy crowds and unexpectedly long waiting
lines will soon force Walt Disney World to double the size of the
entertainment portion of its new Disney-MGM Studios theme park,
company Chairman Michael Eisner says.
   ``The demand for it has been even greater than our wildest
hopes,'' Eisner said. ``We do not want the lines to be that long.
We are trying to rectify it as soon as we can.''
   Specific plans for the expansion, to be carried out in three
years, will be announced in six weeks, Eisner told The Orlando
Sentinel in a story published Tuesday.
   The $500 million, 135-acre central Florida complex has two
sections: the themed area, which is the site of most of the major
attractions, and the film production portion, where visitors ride
trams and walk through a backstage tour.
   Eisner said the studio park ``needs to be bigger, and it needs
to be on the scale of the other two parks,'' known as the Magic
Kingdom and Epcot Center.
   The Magic Kingdom's estimated capacity is 45,000 and Epcot's
about 60,000. The studio theme park can handle about half the
crowds of the Magic Kingdom.
   Because many of its attractions now are geared toward adults,
the studio expansion would add more attractions for younger
children and introduce more traditional Disney characters, Eisner
said.
   It also would introduce a nighttime extravaganza _ like the
fireworks show at the Magic Kingdom and a laser light show at Epcot
_ plus a themed ``land'' attraction such as Fantasyland and
Tomorrowland now at the Magic Kingdom.
   Eisner would not say how much the new construction would cost.
   MCA Inc., which operates Universal Studios Hollywood, plans to
open the theme park portion of its new Universal Studios Florida to
tourists in the Orlando area this coming spring.
   Its working studio, which began movie and television production
last fall, is billed as the nation's largest outside Hollywood. The
studio-and-tour complex is built on a 440-acre site, more than
three times as big as Disney's.
   Jay Stein, president of MCA Recreation Services Group, has taken
issue with Eisner's remarks that Disney's park is ``a new concept,
a new idea.''
   MCA officials contend that Disney copied the idea.
   ``We strongly believe that not only the `idea' to do a studio
tour, but much of the specific content of the Disney attraction
originated with Universal Studios, which has been operating a
studio tour in Los Angeles since 1964,'' Stein said in an interview
after Disney's studio park opened last May.

<HEAD>Sales of New Homes Rose 5.5 Percent in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes, propelled by falling
mortgage rates, rose 5.5 percent in June, the third consecutive
monthly increase, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000 units in June
as the housing industry continued to rebound from a sluggish period
earlier in the year when sales fell to their lowest level since the
1981-82 recession.
   Mortgage rates fell further in July, causing many economists to
look for a climb in home sales and construction in the months
ahead. In fact, many economists believe that a significant rebound
in housing is needed to keep the country out of a recession.
   In a second report showing a slight rebound, the Commerce
Department said orders for manufactured goods edged up 0.4 percent
in June following a steep 2.6 percent drop in May.
   Fixed mortgage rates dipped last week to 9.81 percent, their
lowest point since April 1987. Fixed-rate mortgages peaked in March
at 11.22 percent, the same month that housing starts fell to an
annual rate of 555,000 units, their most sluggish pace since
December 1982.
   The 5.5 percent rise in new home sales in June followed a 4.3
percent May advance and a 9.7 percent rise in April. Altogether,
the three months of increases have driven home sales 20.7 percent
above their March low.
   The increase in sales has come despite the fact that home prices
are up sharply. The median price of a new home jumped 8.3 percent
in June to $129,900. This designates the level where half the homes
in the country sold for more and half sold for less.
   The average price of a new home rose as well, climbing 8.4
percent to $159,100. Housing analysts have blamed the increase on
the fact that much of the market is now composed of the move-up
buyer, who can afford a more expensive home. First-time buyers have
been frozen out so far by the jump in mortgage rates.
   The June increase in sales was powered by a 23.4 percent jump in
sales in the West, which climbed to an annual rate of 232,000 units.
   Sales in the Midwest were up as well but by a smaller 3.1
percent to an annual rate of 99,000 units. Sales in the South edged
up 1.9 percent to a rate of 267,000 units.
   The increases were enough to offset a giant 18.2 percent drop in
new home sales in the Northeast, whcih fell to an annual rate of
72,000 units.

<TEXT>
   Badly divided House Democrats took their fight
over a capital-gains tax cut behind closed doors today and
apparently agreed only that opposition should not be a litmus test
of party loyalty.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the caucus indicated to
him that most Democrats oppose a major cut in capital-gains tax
rates, as is favored by President Bush and a majority of the House
Ways and Means Committee.
   ``I believe that is bad tax policy, bad fiscal policy, unwise,
inequitable and ill-timed,'' Foley said. But he added there has
been no talk of retaliating against Democrats who side with Bush on
the issue.
   ``We don't have a guillotine around here,'' Foley said.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., a Ways and Means member who is chief
sponsor of the proposed rate cut, said he has enough votes in
committee and in the House to pass the plan cutting the tax on
profits realized from investments in securities or property.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the committee, said,
``I think there's a hopeful atmosphere of some kind of
compromise,'' perhaps along lines of a new plan that he outlined
Tuesday.
   His proposal would protect investors from having to pay taxes on
gains caused by inflation, but he declined to provide other
details. He has said he could not support a reduction in the
capital-gains tax rate.
   Rostenkowski said he planned to present the idea later today to
the 13 Republican members of his committee who have joined six
Democrats to produce a majority in favor of a rate cut.
   A Republican committee member, who spoke on condition that he
not be identified by name, said there was no chance Rostenkowski
can persuade Republicans to drop their support of a rate cut, an
idea already rejected by the White House.
   However, the first task facing Rostenkowski is to win back at
least one of the six Democrats. If he does that, he'll have an
18-18 tie in the committee, and won't have to face the caucus in
the somewhat embarrassing position of being in a minority on his
own committee.
   One of the six Democrats, Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas called
the proposal ``creative'' and said it probably could have drawn
wide support if it had been presented earlier.
   ``It's a pretty sound concept, but six of us are still committed
to Mr. Jenkins' proposal,'' Anthony said.
   Anthony referred to another of the six, Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.,
chief sponsor of a plan to cut the top capital gains tax rate to
19.6 percent for two years, and then raise it to 28 percent and
exclude gains caused by inflation.
   The top rate is identical with the top federal income tax rate
on other income, 28 percent, or, for certain upper-income
taxpayers, 33 percent.
   Bush has not formally endorsed Jenkins' plan, but administration
officials have said there was a lot in it they could support.
Bush's proposal would set a top rate of 15 percent, but it would
not apply to timber or commercial buildings.
   Anthony said Rostenkowski's plan would exempt gains caused by
inflation from taxation, but neither he nor Rostenkowski would give
further details.
   The change would apply to profits from assets sold after Dec.
31, 1989.
   Capital gains are increased values of any asset _ stocks, homes,
farms, stamp collections or almost anything that has value.
   All parties agree that a lower capital gains tax rate increases
government revenue in the first year or so it is in effect as
investors take advantage of the rate reduction to get rid of
investments they no longer find of top appeal.
   The Democratic leadership of the House, including Rostenkowski,
has opposed a rate reduction on the grounds that most of the
benefits would go to taxpayers making more than $100,000 a year.
Supporters have argued that denial of rate cuts on those grounds is
nonsensical because it hurts the economy and stifles job-creating

<HEAD>Avon Receives Takeover Proposal From Investor Jacobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. today said investor Irwin L.
Jacobs, who holds a stake in Avon stock, has proposed a possible
acquisition of the cosmetics company for $41 a share, or nearly $3
billion.
   Avon said it received a letter from Jacobs late Tuesday
requesting a meeting to negotiate the deal.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,
said Jacobs' letter would be discussed at the board's regular
meeting on Thursday. In a brief statement, Preston said he has sent
a letter to Jacobs informing him that the Avon board repeatedly has
said the company is not for sale.
   Earlier this year, the Avon board rejected a $39-a-share
takeover offer from rival direct selling company Amway Corp. and
indicated at the time that it would resist future acquisition
attempts. Amway withdrew its bid of about $2.1 billion but
continues to hold roughly 10.3 percent of Avon's common stock
outstanding in a partnership with Jacobs.
   The A-J Partnership, as the alliance of Amway and Jacobs is
called, did not act jointly in making the initial bid for Avon nor
are they acting together now.
   Jacobs said in a telephone interview today that Amway was not
participating in his offer for Avon in any way.
   If Jacobs prevails in his takeover attempt, he said, he plans to
sell Avon's retail division, which consists of some the country's
best-selling perfumes sold at department store counters, including
Giorgio Beverly Hills and Red.
   The direct selling operations of New York-based Avon in the
United States and abroad would be retained, Jacobs said.
   He said he has no intention of selling any piece of Avon to
Amway or to Mary Kay Corp., the parent of direct seller Mary Kay
Cosmetics Inc., which also has previously expressed interest in
Avon.
   Jacobs, who runs his investment operations from Minneapolis,
also said he has submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange
Commission in which he said he has hired an investment banking
division of Citicorp to arrange financing for the all-cash bid.
   He said he has not had any contact with Avon executives except a
telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his letter.
   Jacobs' $41-a-share offer for Avon is worth about $2.25 billion
based on 54.91 million shares of common stock outstanding. Jacobs
also said in the SEC filing that he contemplates redeeming Avon's
preferred shares, which would cost $33.50 per share, or a total of
about $603 million.
   Avon also has about $1 billion in debt that would be part of any
acquisition.

<TEXT>
   Boeing Co., halfway through another record year,
today opened contract talks with union leaders who say they want a
wage hike this time instead of the productivity bonuses of the past
six years.
   Negotiations began in Wichita, Kan., between Boeing and three
districts of the Machinists union, which represent 57,800 workers
in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Wichita.
   Representing the union are District 751 president Tom Baker of
Seattle, Ron Eldridge of Wichita's District 70 and George Miller of
Portland's District 24.
   Aerospace industry analysts say the union is in a strong
position to exact a favorable settlement because of a $67 billion
backlog of commercial airplane orders, $346 million in profits in
the first half of 1989 and a shortage of skilled workers that
forced Boeing to borrow Lockheed Corp. workers earlier this year.
   Union officials say they want an hourly wage increase, likely to
be in the double-digits, to replace once-a-year productivity
bonuses Boeing has given the past six years.
   Boeing customers have been irritated by deliver delays for
747-400 model jets. With 44 due for delivery in the last quarter, a
work stoppage would jeopardize Boeing's reputation for reliability.
   The company borrowed about 600 Lockheed workers earlier this
year as it rescheduled delivery dates for the 747-400, and union
officials say those workers should be leaving Boeing this month.
   ``I think they will get a wage increase ... I don't think push
is going to come to shove here,'' said Gary Reich, aerospace
analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The chance of a strike is small, say analysts, who believe
Boeing workers know they are better off riding the crest of record
airplane orders than sitting out the good times on a picket line.
   ``I would not anticipate a prolonged labor disruption or
strike,'' said William Deatherage, aerospace analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   ``Not many people at Boeing are not aware of the cyclical nature
of the business. This is the opportunity of a lifetime (for
workers) to get all the overtime they can,'' he said.
   Other union contract requests will cover overtime rules, an
improved cost-of-living index, better pension payments, on-site
education programs and child care, union officers said. Wages will
be the last item discussed.
   Boeing, led by chief negotiator Larry McKean, vice president of
human resources, has until Aug. 9 to make its first
counterproposal, with further negotiations scheduled as needed.
   The union's current three-year contract expires Oct. 3.
   Before departing for Wichita on Monday, Baker said the union
would ask for a ``significant'' wage increase, adding he did not
consider a single-digit increase significant.
   Except for welders, the people who make Boeing planes currently
earn $8.88 to $18.42 per hour depending on pay level and seniority.
The average wage is $13.50 to $14 an hour.
   ``All the signals are that it looks good for us. Boeing can well
afford to pay an increase in wages and increase benefits,'' Baker
said.
   ``Our relations have in general been very good with the union,''
said Boeing spokesman Paul Binder. He declined to comment on the
negotiations.
   Union officials want a wage increase to replace, either
completely or partially, the bonuses that have ranged from 3
percent to 12 percent a year since 1983.
   Analysts said a reasonable increase would not affect Boeing's
profitability, especially if it can pass part of the increase on to
customers. Boeing also adjusts its prices as labor and commodity
indexes rise.
   ``Customers may have to take a bite in the next three years'' if
a wage hike is granted, said Steve Binder, senior aerospace analyst
with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. in New York. He is not related to
Boeing's Paul Binder.
   Frank Shrontz, chairman and chief executive officer, has said
that Boeing's goal is to hold down costs to improve profit margins
and increase shareholders' return on equity.
   The union's bargaining position represents a complete turnaround
from its position during the 1983 and 1986 negotiations. In 1983,
about 12,000 Boeing workers had been laid off because of the
industry slump, weakening the union's hand at the bargaining table.

<HEAD>GTW Wins $100 Million Libel Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury awarded $100 million in libel
damages today to GTE Corp. after rejecting Home Shopping Network's
claim that the communications company was to blame for lost sales.
   HSN contended GTE didn't give it adequate equipment to handle a
large volume of calls in 1986 and 1987 as the network expanded into
11 new markets. GTE won the case on its counterclaim.
   The six-member jury reached its verdict after about five hours
of deliberations in the complicated case following a six-week trial
before Pinellas Circuit Judge Howard Rives.
   The award was to be split evenly by GTE Florida and GTE
Communciations. In a breakdown of each award, the jury said $10
million should by paid by HSN, $20 million by board Chairman Roy
Speer and $20 million by President Lowell Paxon.
   In final arguments Monday, HSN attorneys said GTE told ``little
white lies'' to the network to cover up the communications
company's failure to provide for the volume of calls.
   On Tuesday, GTE lawyer Roy Reardon responded that a Dec. 2,
1986, letter placed in evidence documented that HSN thought the
telephone firm had been ``responsive to all our previous needs''
and was looking forward ``to continuing this highly successful
relationship.''
   Ten months after that, HSN sued, claiming it lost millions of
calls and about $500 million in potential sales because its GTE
telephone network equipment was insufficient for the volume of
calls. The parent company, based in Stamford, Conn., the Florida
subsidiary and GTE Communications were named as defendants.
   In response, GTE filed a slander and libel counterclaim placing
blame for HSN's decline in the electronics market and stock market
on its own mismanagement there.
   HSN's 1986 purchase of 11 UHF stations in new markets, combined
with its entrance into the cable television market, caused
subscribers to soar from 9 million to 46.5 million in one year,
GTE's Reardon said.
   GTE knew about the cable arrangements, he added. Cable companies
were offered a $1 million stock option which enhanced their
interest in HSN, he said, and 70 cable outlets were obtained.
   But, even when HSN made its initial public offering of stock on
May 13, 1986, the company didn't mention its plans to purchase the
broadcast stations as a second operational network, Reardon argued.
   He recalled that HSN operations vice president William DeLany
warned in September 1986 the company didn't have enough personnel
to handle the growing number of calls, but Speer ``didn't want to
hear they needed more operators.''
   Competition from similar retailers also has hurt HSN, Reardon
said.

   Shares ended sharply higher Wednesday following a
strong rally on Wall Street during the London afternoon.
   A lack of selling pressure and strong rallies in the retaili and
pharmaceutical sectors also combined to push the market higher.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share ended up 15.5
points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,307.8, the session high. At its
lowest, the index touched 2,285.8, a fall of 6.5 points.
   Share prices opened lower but rallied on news of an agreement by
General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG with the British government
under which the British and West German electronics giants may
resume their joint bid for Plessey Co. PLC., a British electronics
company.
   Dealers said trading volume wilted during the afternoon, as the
market tracked movements on Wall Street.
   ``It was a pretty volatile day but it seemed the market wanted
to rally after its declines earlier in the week,'' one trader said.
   Volume was 424.8 million shares, compared with 413.5 million
shares Tuesday.

   Stock prices staged a modest advance today,
rebounding from Tuesday's setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 7.97 to 2,649.09

of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 749 up, 646 down and

   The market's unsettled showing Tuesday, when the Dow Jones

that the slowing of the economy might lead to something worse than

   Analysts said those worries might be eased, however, by a series
of economic reports over the remainder of the week.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders rose 0.4 percent in June.
   The department is due to report Thursday on the index of leading
economic indicators for the same month. On Friday, monthly data are
scheduled on the employment situation for July.
   Avon Products rose 1 to 36{. Investor Irwin Jacobs said he

<HEAD>WPPSS To Re-enter Bond Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Public Power Supply System
announced plans Wednesday to re-enter the financial markets for the
first time since defaulting on $2.25 billion in bonds for two
nuclear plants in 1983.
   WPPSS said it plans to sell $450 million in revenue bonds to
refund higher interest bonds sold in 1981 and 1982. Pricing and
sale of the bonds for WPPSS nuclear plants 1 and 3 are expected to
take place the week of Aug. 21.
   The 1983 default on bonds for nuclear plants 4 and 5 was the
largest in municipal bond market history. WPPSS bond ratings were
suspended in 1983, but Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. restablished its
rating late last year.
   The refunding bonds are secured by net billing agreements that
require the Bonneville Power Administration, a self-financed
federal agency that markets electric power, to pay all costs
connected with projects 1 and 3.
   The net billed bonds are the first step in a long-awaited
refunding program to reduce debt service on about $2 billion of
high interest bonds. The supply system also expects to refund
aproximately $800 million of high-interest bonds issued for project
2 over the next several years.
   ``At current interest rates, the program will reduce the supply
system's costs an average of $70-$80 million a year over the next
30 years,'' Don Mazur, supply system managing director, and Jim
Jura, Bonneville administrator, said in a statement.
   Following the WPPSS default, an amendment to federal bankruptcy
laws clarified that a bankruptcy would not impair protection of
revenues, funds and other assets of projects 1, 2 and 3 from claims
by projects 4 and 5 bondholders.
   In contrast to projects 4 and 5, bonds for projects 1 through 3
are secured by net billing agreements with Bonneville, which
markets power from 30 federal hydroelectric projects, most in the
Columbia River basin.
   WPPSS is a consortium of utilities that was formed in the early
1970s to build the five nuclear plants.
   Bonneville and participating utilities without interruption have
provided funds for all obligations with respect to supply system
bonds on projects 1 through 3 since the first bonds were issued in
1971.
   Project 2 has been in commercial operation since 1984. Projects
1 and 3 are in extended construction delay because the energy they
would produce isn't needed presently.

   Wheat futures prices were mostly higher but corn
and soybeans lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, where
the expected commodity fraud indictments may have sent some traders
to the sidelines early.
   While wheat thrived in the wake of a 100,000-ton buy late
Tuesday by China and rumors of a second buy, equally large
purchases of soybeans established a contract low for the seventh
time in eight days.
   Volume was lighter than usual at the exchange's soybean pit,
rumored to be one of four pits at the BOT and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange where undercover federal agents concentrated
their investigative efforts during the 2{-year probe.
   ``It probably kept people away,'' one trader who asked not to be

markets closed. ``But how much effect it actually had is debatable.
A lot of this is already in the market.
   ``And besides,'' the trader added, ``bearish weather is killing
the beans _ not indictments.''
   On the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1{ cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.89 a bushel; corn was
1{ cents lower to 1} cents higher, with September at $2.21\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher, with September at

   People in Des Moines, Iowa, lead the nation in

according to a survey released Wednesday.
   Following Des Moines were Tucson, Ariz.; Little Rock, Ark.;
Oklahoma City; Tacoma, Wash.; Omaha, Neb.; Albuquerque, N.M.; and

   The survey was based on more than 60,000 telephone interviews
last year of people in 80 of the nation's largest metropolitan
areas by Directory Data, a division of Survey Sampling Inc. of
Fairfield, Conn.
   Adults in the Des Moines area refer to the Yellow Pages an
average of 2.9 times a week, while New York adults refer to them an
average of 0.87 times a week, the survey found.
   Matt Cone, a Directory Data official, said he did not want to
speculate on possible reasons for the differences in usage.
   Directory Data said its survey is the first thorough examination
of Yellow Pages usage. It is supplying more detailed figures to
advertisers, advertising agencies and publishers.

   An advertising agency said Wednesday it had
dropped the Helmsley Hotels' $5 million-a-year account, saying
proprietor Leona Helmsley intruded too much and recently cut agency
fees by 60 percent.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who has been on trial in a tax evasion case in
U.S. District Court, has been depicted in the advertising as the
``queen'' standing on guard making sure everything is perfect at
the hotels.
   The ad agency Taylor-Gordon, Aarons &amp; Co. Inc. had handled the
Helmsley account for the past three years. Agency president Elaine
Taylor-Gordon said her company stands to lose $500,000 a year from
its decision.
   ``All of us knew she was queen and we were there to serve her,''
Taylor-Gordon said. ``It was evident in her body language, her
imperiousness and her arrogance.''
   She described a typical business meeting with Mrs. Helmsley:
``She was drinking martinis, and I was drinking Brioschi. There was
a lot of tension ... She told me, `Don't get comfortable. You're
not here for a social event.'''
   Agency officials said she sealed her fate with Taylor-Gordon,
Aarons when she imposed an arbitrary 60 percent cut in agency fees
for May and June.
   They said Mrs. Helmsley was informed of the decision in a letter
sent to her home. Mrs. Helmsley was approached by reporters at the
courthouse about the agency's decision, but she said nothing.
   Taylor-Gordon, Aarons was not the first agency to use Mrs.
Helmsley in ads for the hotel chain, or to dub her the ``queen.''
   The approach was apparently effective: occupancy jumped from 24
percent before the ads to 87 percent afterwards, agency officials
said.

<HEAD>Say Air Bags Increase Ford Prices for 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s 1990 models will cost about 4.8
percent more than 1989 models, partly because of new federal
requirements on air-bag protection for passengers, a preliminary
price list indicates.
   The increase showed up in a Ford advisory recently sent to
dealers for use in taking early orders for fall, company spokesman
Dave Krupp said Wednesday.
   ``About half of that is for air bags,'' Krupp said of the price
boost.
   Ford will announce final prices for the 1990 models in
mid-September, two to three weeks in advance of the Oct. 5 debut of
new vehicles, he said.
   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. officials remained
silent Wednesday on their pricing plans for the new model year.
   GM will announce prices later this month in preparation for a
late September introduction of the new models, spokesman Terry
Sullivan said.
   Chrysler will announce prices in late September or early October
and introduce its 1990 models in early October, spokeswoman Karen
Stewart said.
   Neither GM nor Chrysler has sent preliminary prices to dealers,
the two said. Analysts have predicted automakers would trim
production in anticipation of slow 1989 sales continuing into next
year, consequently raising prices.
   GM and Chrysler have estimated air bags will add $500 to the
price of a new car, and Ford has estimated that cost at between
$350 and $700.

   The dollar gained against most major foreign
currencies in subdued U.S. dealings Wednesday after weakening on
markets abroad.
   Gold prices posted minor changes. On the Commodity Exchange in
New York, gold for August delivery closed at $370.10 a troy ounce,
down 70 cents from Tuesday's settlement. The Republic National Bank
quoted bullion at $369.70 an ounce as of 4 p.m. in New York, 80
cents lower than Tuesday's late bid.
   Despite closing near its highest levels of the day in New York,
currency dealers said the dollar lacked direction and a bearish
undercurrent lingered in the market due to the likelihood of
additional U.S. interest rate declines.
   The value of a country's currency typically is eroded by
reductions in the country's interest rates.
   Simon Fischer, of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., attributed part of the
buying to reactions to Tuesday's selloff and maneuvers in
anticipation of reports expected to shed more light on the
condition of the U.S. economy.
   The Commerce Department's June report on the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators is scheduled for Thursday release and on Friday
the Labor Department is due to issue June unemployment figures.
   The market was preoccupied with developments in the Middle East
regarding Western hostages. Reports of American warships moving
positions raised speculation about possible military action in the
Middle East following the reported execution of Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins.
   Earlier, in currency trading in foreign financial centers, the
dollar ended generally lower.
   Dealers in Europe reported trading seemed trendless, with the
number of participants operating in the market down due to summer
holidays. They said the dollar was unlikely to make any major moves
ahead of the U.S. economic reports.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.45 yen to close at 136.20 yen. Later
in London, the dollar traded at 136.05 yen. But, in New York the
dollar closed at 136.60 yen, up from 135.80 yen on Tuesday.
   The British pound traded at $1.6635 late in London, up from
Tuesday's $1.6550. Later, in New York, sterling stood at $1.6560
compared to $1.6648 on Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8575 West German marks, up from
1.8505; 1.5970 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 1.17515 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1747; 6.29 French francs, up from 6.266; and
1,334.50 Italian lire, up from 1,330.05.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.8505 West German marks, down from 1.8660;
1.5915 Swiss francs, down from 1.6075; 6.2695 French francs, down
from 6.3135; 2.0895 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1060; 1,332.00
Italian lire, down from 1,342.50; and 1.1755 Canadian dollars, up

   Gold prices ended with modest to no change.
   Gold was bid at $368.25 a troy ounce late Wednesday in London,
unchanged from late Tuesday. Trading was suspended Wednesday in
Zurich for a national holiday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 6 cents an ounce to close at
$371.32.
   Silver traded at $5.27 a troy ounce in London, up from $5.23

<HEAD>Avon Receives Renewed Takeover Interest _ This Time From Jacobs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 9th graf to UPDATE with closing Avon stock price.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK _ Investor Irwin L. Jacobs has made a roughly $2.85
billion takeover proposal to Avon Products Inc., the latest
unsolicited offer for the cosmetics company that has spurned
previous suitors, Jacobs and Avon disclosed Wednesday.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive, said
Jacobs' request for a meeting to negotiate a possible purchase of
Avon _ the world's biggest direct sales company _ would be reviewed
at the board's regular meeting on Thursday at Avon's New York
headquarters.
   In a brief news release, Preston said he sent a letter to Jacobs
informing him that in the past the board members have stressed that
Avon is not for sale.
   Jacobs, who oversees his investment empire from Minneapolis,
said in a telephone interview Wednesday that he's never been in a
better position to carry out an acquisition attempt and indicated
he would be tenacious in his quest for Avon.
   ``We've had the best year we've ever had,'' Jacobs said. ``All
these things play a part. I have never been more serious about a
commitment in my life.''
   In three separate deals in the past year, Jacobs and investment
partners reported making more than $164 million in profit.
   Jacobs' $41-a-share offer for Avon is worth about $2.25 billion
based on 54.91 million shares of common stock outstanding. Jacobs
also said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that he contemplates redeeming Avon's preferred shares, which would
cost $33.50 per share, or a total of about $603 million, raising
the price tag on Avon to roughly $2.85 billion.
   Avon also has about $1 billion in debt that would be part of any
acquisition.
   Avon stock gained $1 to $36.50 a share in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading Wednesday.
   The company has slammed the door on at least two suitors in
recent months.
   In May, the Avon board rejected a hostile $39-a-share takeover
bid from rival direct selling company Amway Corp. and indicated at
the time that it would resist future acquisition attempts.
   Only days after Avon turned down Amway, Mary Kay Corp., parent
of the door-to-door makeup seller Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc.,
disclosed its interest in acquiring Avon and also got a cold
shoulder.
   Although Amway withdrew its bid of about $2.1 billion, the
company still has a stake in Avon.
   Through a partnership with Jacobs, Amway has an interest in
about 10.3 percent of Avon's common stock outstanding. Jacobs
controls about 55 percent of the Avon stock owned by A-J
Partnership, as the alliance of Amway and Jacobs is called.
   The partnership didn't act jointly in making the initial bid for
Avon and Jacobs said they are not acting together now.
   If he prevails in his takeover attempt, Jacobs said, he would
keep Avon's core direct-selling business in the United States and
retain a significant interest in the company's international
division.
   There are about 475,000 Avon sales representatives operating in
the United States and another 1 million selling Avon cosmetics,
toiletries and jewelry in foreign markets. Avon, known in the past
for the ad slogan ``Ding Dong, Avon Calling,'' is the world's
biggest direct-sales company.
   Jacobs said if he gets control of Avon he would sell Avon's
retail division, which consists of some of the country's
best-selling perfumes sold at department store counters, including
Giorgio Beverly Hills and Red.
   He also would finish divesting the health care businesses which
Avon has been selling.
   The divestitures have been part of Avon's strategy to enhance
profitability. In the second quarter, Avon earned $39.5 million on
sales of $778 million compared with a loss of $82.5 million and
sales of $704 million a year earlier.
   Jacobs said he had no intention of selling any piece of Avon to
Amway or to Mary Kay. He said he has not had any contact with Avon
executives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his
letter.
   Jacobs wouldn't take a management position at Avon if he gains
control, he said. But he said he is familiar with the industry by
virtue of his ownership of Watkins Inc. of Winona, Minn. Jacobs
purchased the health and beauty aids company out of bankruptcy in
1977.
   Jacobs said he has hired an investment banking arm of Citicorp
to help him arrange financing for the all-cash offer for Avon.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices closed mixed Wednesday
with crude oil bouncing back from earlier lows despite ongoing
concern about excess oil supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 25
cents to finish at $18.28 a barrel after falling 28 cents on
Tuesday. The contract had dipped to $17.78 a barrel during the
trading session.
   Contracts for later delivery were mixed.
   Among refined oil products traded on the exchange, unleaded
gasoline for September delivery fell 0.58 cent to 50.85 cents a
gallon, while future contracts were mixed.
   Domestic heating oil for September rose 0.34 cent to 49.54 cents
a gallon and other contract months were mostly higher.
   The market opened lower mainly on a report showing that oil and
gasoline inventories are continuing to rise.
   The American Petroleum Institute said supplies of crude oil,
gasoline and heating oil increased in the week ended July 28. The
API report was released after the close of trading on Tuesday.
   Crude oil inventories rose 882,000 barrels to 331.4 million
barrels from the previous week, while gasoline stocks increased by
4.6 million barrels to 225.96 million and heating oil rose by 2.1
million to 111.5 million barrels, the report said.
   On a yearly basis, however, crude oil stocks were down 16.9
million barrels from the same time last year and heating oil was
off 6.8 million barrels. Gasoline inventories, however, were 16.3
million barrels higher.
   Later in the day, traders said oil prices recovered, partly on
technical factors.
   ``The momentum just wasn't there to move lower,'' said Richard
Redoglio, energy broker for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Analysts said nervousness about the U.S. hostage situation in
the Middle East also helped boost prices. Traders have attributed
some price strength in recent days to investor concern that
political events involving U.S. hostages could disrupt oil
shipments from the Middle East.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Soar on News of Big Export Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures snapped a slump and surged Wednesday on rumors
that the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer, had sold
500,000 tons to a major trading house.
   On other markets, sugar continued rallying in the face of
growing demand and the fear of weak yields from Western Eurpoean
crops; soybeans fell to a new low for the seventh time in eight
days, depressed by wet weather and stuck there because many traders
halted trading early to await indictments stemming for a 2{-year
investigation into commodities trading fraud.
   Cocoa, traded on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange,
jumped at the opening bell after rumors surfaced that Ivory Coast
President Felix Houphet-Boigny, who had been in France in recent
days, helped seal a huge export deal with trading company Philipp
Brothers Inc.
   The rumored deal suggested a heightened demand for cocoa, which
has languished recently. The size of such a purchase, if confirmed,
would also raise the possibility of short-term supply problems.
   ``As sleepy as the market had been, a lot of traders thought the
market was at its technical bottom and as soon as it got a boost
from the Ivory Coast report, there were a lot of people jumping on
the bandwagon,'' said Pete Henig, who tracks commodities for Refco
Inc., New York.
   Cocoa climbed $66 to $70 per ton higher, with the contract for
delivery in September at $1,327 a ton.
   Sugar continued gaining because demand is outpacing supply.
Early reports that a virus has cut substantially into crop yields
in West Germany and France helped bolster prices.
   Sugar climbed .22 cent to .31 cent higher, with October at 14.43
cents a pound.
   Nervousness over commodity fraud indictments, announced after
the close of business Wednesday, had sent some traders to the
sidelines early at the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat futures prices
closed higher, but corn and soybeans were mostly lower.
   Wheat thrived in the wake of a 100,000-ton buy late Tuesday by
the Chinese, and there were rumors they planned a second, equally
large purchase.
   But November soybeans slipped 7 cents, establishing a contract
low for the seventh time in eight days.
   The indictments ``probably kept people away,'' said one trader
who asked not to be identified. ``But how much effect it actually
had is debatable. A lot of this is already in the market.
   ``And besides,'' the trader added, ``bearish weather is killing
the beans _ not indictments.''
   Wheat was unchanged to 2} cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.90\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to
1{ cents higher, with September at $2.21{ a bushel; oats were \
cent to { cent higher, with September at $1.33\ a bushel; and
soybeans were 1{ cents to 8{ cents lower, with August at $6.08\ a
bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were sharply higher at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle climbed .35 cent to 1.20 cents, with August at 73.55
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .60 cent higher, with
August at 83.62 cents pound; live hogs were .23 cent to 1.23 cents
higher, with August at 46.35 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were .35 cent to 1.10 cents higher, with August at 25.92 cents a
pound.
   Precious metals were off slightly, with silver leading the
decline.
   At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled 79 cents to
$1.50 lower, with August at $370.10 a troy ounce; silver was 2.7
cents to 3 cents lower, with August at 522.5 cents a troy ounce.
Platinum, traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange, was off $1.50
to $1.60, with September at $500.10 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures were mixed at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil was 9 cents lower to 25 cents higher, with September
at $18.28 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent lower to .34 cent
higher, with September at 49.54 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .58 cent lower to .35 cent higher, with Septmeber at
50.85 cents a gallon.

   Fruit juice exports to Japan and Korea helped

other horticultural products in May, the Agriculture Department
reported Wednesday.
   Shipments to points other than Canada were valued at $252
million in May, up 3 percent from April and 4 percent from May
1988, the department's foreign agricultural service reported.
   Juice imports to Korea increased 18 times from last year to $2.1

$270,000 in May.
   Shipments to East Asia accounted for 64 percent of fruit juices
exports, with Japan receiving the bulk.
   Canada remained the premier market, however, for horticultural
products. Imports rose nearly 11 percent from 1987 to reach a value
of $1.5 billion, 60 percent of total horticultural imports for
Canada.

<HEAD>Major Airlines Match Fare Cuts by Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The rare phenomenon of a summer air fare war broke out
Wednesday, as several major airlines matched a discount program
announced a day earlier by Continental Airlines.
   Houston-based Continental, often a fare-cutting leader, said
Tuesday it reduced to $75 each way its weekend fares through Labor
Day on most non-stops, and lowered transcontinental fares to $100
each way.
   Tickets for the lowered fares must be purchased on a round-trip
basis and are non-refundable.
   The cuts were quickly matched Tuesday by Northwest Airlines and
Alaska Airlines. American Airlines and United Airlines, two of the
largest carriers, joined in Wednesday, along with Braniff Inc. and
Trans World Airlines.
   ``For competitive reasons, we will match this,'' said Bob
Blattner, a TWA spokesman in St. Louis, Mo.
   Fares normally hold steady or rise in summer, when travel demand
is at its peak.
   ``Recent research shows that more and more Americans want to
take several more short vacations, or long weekend trips,''
Continental spokesman Ned Walker said Tuesday. ``So what we've done
is develop this nationwide weekend fare program to meet this
growing trend.''
   Tickets must be purchased by Aug. 11 and must be paid for within
24 hours after a reservation is made. Travel must begin on a
Thursday, Friday or Saturday.
   On some of the airlines, the return flight must be on that same
weekend or the Monday following it. On others, the return may be on
any Saturday, Sunday or Monday through Labor Day.
   About 750,000 seats will be available on Continental for the
lowered fares on each of the five weekends, according to the
airline.
   Under the new fares, a round trip from Denver to Boston will
cost $150 on Continental, compared with the carrier's current
lowest, advance-purchase MaxSaver fare of $318. A round trip from
Los Angeles to New Orleans will cost $150, compared with the lowest
MaxSaver fare of $298.
   A New York-Seattle roundtrip on Continental will cost $200,
compared with the $358 MaxSaver fare, and a Los Angeles-to-New York
round trip also will cost $200, compared with the $358 MaxSaver
price.

<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes climbed 5.5 percent in
June, the third consecutive monthly increase, the government said
Wednesday in a report that gave some economists hope that a rebound
in housing will help keep the country out of a recession this year.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000 units in June
as sales continued to respond favorably to falling mortgage rates
after skidding in March to their slowest pace in more than six
years.
   Mortgage rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent for fixed-rate
loans in March, have been falling since that time, helped along by
credit easing on the part of the Federal Reserve.
   Optimistic forecasters said they believed a rebound in housing
and other credit-sensitive sectors of the economy would be enough
to keep the record peacetime expansion chugging along, although at
a more modest pace in the second half of the year.
   ``We are confident that we can avoid a recession,'' said Thomas
Lawler, an economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association.
``Housing is recovering from a slump earlier in the year as people
respond to lower interest rates.''
   But a second economic report Wednesday produced less enthusiasm.
The Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods
remained weak in June, edging up by only 0.4 percent after a steep
2.6 percent drop in May.
   Factory orders have fallen in three of the past six months, and
the widespread view is that manufacturing will weaken further in
coming months as businesses cut back their own investment plans.
   But many economists said they believed strong export sales and a
rebound in housing would be enough to keep the economy moving
forward.
   ``If exports continue fairly strong and housing comes back, that
will help offset the weakness in other areas,'' said Cynthia Latta,
an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill. ``We believe we will be able to
skim by without a recession.''
   Ms. Latta said her optimism was based in part on the fact that
sales of both new and existing homes posted good gains in June,
even before the biggest part of the drop in mortgage rates had
occurred in July.
   Fixed rate mortgages are currently averaging 9.81 percent, their
lowest level since early 1987. Economists are predicting further
declines in the months ahead as the Fed continues easing credit in
an effort to prevent a recession.
   ``Buyers are taking advantage of falling interest rates to buy
the most they can afford,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist
of the National Association of Realtors. ``The continued decline in
rates is drawing buyers to new homes as well as existing homes.''
   The 5.5 percent rise in new home sales in June followed a 4.3
percent May advance and a 9.7 percent rise in April. Altogether,
the three months of increases have driven home sales 20.7 percent
above their low point of the year, an annual rate of 555,000 sales
in March, which was the weakest sales pace since December 1982 in
the depths of the last recession.
   Home prices were up as well in June with the median price of a
new home jumping 8.3 percent to $129,900. The median price means
half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price
of a new home was up 8.4 percent to $159,100.
   Housing analysts said part of the increase reflects the fact
that much of the market is composed of move-up buyers who can
afford more expensive homes.
   The June increase in sales was powered by a 23.4 percent jump in
sales in the West, which climbed to an annual rate of 232,000
units. The California real estate market is currently the strongest
in the country.
   Sales in the Midwest were up as well but by a smaller 3.1
percent to an annual rate of 99,000 units. Sales in the South edged
up 1.9 percent to a rate of 267,000 units.
   The increases were enough to offset a giant 18.2 percent drop in
new home sales in the Northeast, which fell to an annual rate of
72,000 units. Analysts said that the Northeast, until last year the
hottest market in country, was suffering from a sharp run-up in
prices.
   David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, said he believed price declines were inevitable in
this region, especially given the high inventory of unsold homes
being carried by many developers.

   As Wall Street's rally resumed Wednesday, major
stock market indexes set records in Paris, Brussels, Milan,
Amsterdam and Stockholm.
   The American stock exchanges are not the only ones that have
rebounded from the world stock market crash of Oct. 19 and 20,
1987. In fact, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks trails
other major indexes in its recovery.
   Stock prices rose Wednesday in Tokyo, the world's biggest stock
market, but remained below the record high set in Monday's session.
The Tokyo market was the first to climb back above the highs
reached in 1987.
   London shares remained below their 1987 peaks but set a
post-crash high, influenced by the rally on Wall Street and rallies
in retailing and pharmaceutical stocks. The Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 index rose to 2,307.8.
   In Paris, share prices recovered from their early weakness to
close slightly higher in thin trading. The CAC index of French
shares reached a record high of 505.9.
   In West Germany, foreign buying of blue-chip stocks kept a rally
going on the Frankfurt exchange. Daimler-Benz, maker of Mercedes
cars, was again the strongest performer. The exchange's Dax index
entered record territory during the session but slipped back.
   In Belgium, the Brussels stock market index set a record
6,208.77, rising in harmony with other European exchanges.
   In the Netherlands, stock prices were mixed but there were
enough gainers to push the Amsterdam main market index to a record
for a third consecutive session. The CBS general shares index hit
201.6.
   In Sweden, the bull run in Stockholm continued with an 18th
record in 20 sessions. Forestry shares led the way. The
Affaersvaerlden index closed at 1,317.2.
   Italy's news of a resurgence of inflation failed to hurt the
Milan stock market, where the main index jumped to a record 1,153.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
ended up 0.88 points at 34,899. It surpassed 35,000 for the first
time at the end of morning trading but then retreated.
   So far this year the U.S. stock market has risen 23.5 percent;
the British stock market is up 27 percent; the Japanese market is
up 9.6 percent; and the West German market is up 19.3 percent, when
measured in local currencies, according to statistics compiled by
Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, a Geneva-based
subsidiary of the U.S. investment banking firm.
   In the very long term, Tokyo's stock prices are up nearly 1,600
percent since 1969, while American prices are up a relatively
meager 320 percent.

<HEAD>Warner Attorney Ordered to Delaware Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney who admitted she mistakenly
gave confidential court documents to a reporter during the Time
Inc. takeover fight has been ordered to appear before the Delaware
Supreme Court.
   Barbara Robbins of the New York-based law firm Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen &amp; Katz has been ordered to court Aug. 22 to show why she
should not be held in contempt.
   Robbins was on vacation Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment.
   Law partner Michael Schwartz called the incident ``inadvertant
and not blameworthy.''
   The law firm represented Warner Communications Inc., which had
an agreement to be acquired by Time. Paramount Communications Inc.,
attempting a hostile takeover of Time, was appealing a Chancery
Court ruling that refused to block the merger.
   The documents had been submitted by Paramount in its appeal. The
court had ordered the documents be kept confidential after a
request from Time because they contained estimates of the dollar
value of Time's core businesses, including the value of People,
Sports Illustrated, Time and Fortune magazines.
   The estimates appeared July 26 in an article in The New York
Times.
   A spokesperson for Warner, who did not want to be identified,
called it an ``honest mistake.''
   ``We know that there was no intention on her part to violate the
court order and we're convinced it was an honest mistake,'' the
spokesperson said.
   Robbins admitted to the court last Thursday that she supplied
the documents to a Times reporter, unaware the documents were
confidential.
   In a letter to state Supreme Court administrator Stephen D.
Taylor, Robbins said the documents were not stamped ``Confidential
Under Seal'' on the cover.
   ``As I am sure you can imagine, as Warner's counsel I certainly
would have had no desire to release to the public documents as to
which Time sought confidential treatment. Indeed, in (Chancery
Court), Warner joined with Time in seeking confidentiality with
respect to certain documents,'' Robbins wrote.
   ``It is an unfortunate outcome of a document not being stamped
confidential which Paramount should have stamped confidential,''
Schwartz said.

   A dissident Democrat said Wednesday that
despite the all-out opposition of party leaders, he has enough
support in the House of Representatives to win a reduction in
capital-gains taxes.
   ``I have them now,'' Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., said when asked
whether he has pledges of enough votes to win the debate.
   Jenkins talked to reporters after a closed-door Democratic
caucus that leaders said indicated a substantial majority of party
members oppose a cut in the tax on capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of stocks and other investments. However, some
acknowledged that if a vote were taken immediately, enough
Democrats would join a solid bloc of Republicans to pass the
reduction.
   ``I think a majority of Democrats take the position that we
should not agree to this particular issue,'' said Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash. ``I believe it's bad tax policy, bad fiscal policy,
unwise, inequitable and ill-timed.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways
and Means Committee, was still trying to win back at least one of
the six Democrats on the panel who are backing a capital-gains cut.
He offered a compromise that, rather than reducing thetax rate,
would benefit investors by protecting inflation-caused profits
against taxation.
   ``Republicans surprised me with how receptive they were'' to his
proposal, Rostenkowski said after briefing members of his
committee. He called his plan ``pretty much what I view as a
possible compromise where everybody wins.''
   His proposal, less generous than Jenkins', would benefit most
assets except preferred stock, stock in foreign corporations, debt
instruments and other intangibles. It would work this way for
assets purchased after July 31, 1989:
   _If held for more than one year but less than five, the asset
would be ``indexed'' for inflation. That is, total inflation over
the years the property was owned would be subtracted from the
purchase price; thus only the non-inflation gain would be taxed.
   _If held for more than five years but less than 10, an investor
could subtract inflation or could exclude from tax 25 percent of
the sales price.
   _If held for more than 10 years, an investor could subtract
inflation or 50 percent of the sales price.
   ``I think there's a hopeful atmosphere of some kind of
compromise,'' Rostenkowski told reporters. He suggested the Bush
administration should get more involved in the negotiations.
   ``It's very difficult for me to negotiate with the White House,
with (Rep. Bill) Archer (a Texan who is senior Republican on Ways
and Means) _ I don't know who it is that can say, `OK. We've got an
understanding.'''
   Rep. J.J. Pickle of Texas, one of the six dissident Ways and
Means Democrats, sounded a similar tone. ``Compromise must come
from the White House,'' Pickle said. ``If they don't, we'll just
have a little shootout.''
   The administration already has agreed informally to a compromise
of sorts.
   Bush proposed that the maximum tax on capital gains, now 33
percent, be reduced to 15 percent. He reasoned that would boost
investment, create jobs and spur so much economic activity that
government revenues would increase and help reduce the deficit.
   There was almost no support among Ways and Means Democrats for
that proposal, so Jenkins and Archer came up with a substitute,
which now has the administration's backing.
   The Jenkins-Archer proposal would cut the top rate to 19.6
percent for two years, then increase it to 28 percent and ensure
that gains caused by inflation would not be taxed.
   Democratic leaders oppose a capital-gains rate cut for three
reasons: because 80 percent of the benefit would go to investors
with incomes totaling $100,000 a year or more; they say it would
reduce government revenues after the first year or two, and they
fear that restoring a capital-gains tax preference that was
repealed as part of the 1986 tax overhaul would lead to the
unraveling of that landmark law.
   In an effort to block the Jenkins-Archer plan, Rostenkowski
offered a new formula that would prevent taxation of
inflation-caused gains and also give investors at least a slight
break in the tax on their profits that represented a real increase
in the value of property.
   However, there was no indication that Rostenkowski's proposal
had drawn any votes away from the Jenkins-Archer plan.
   Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis., who opposes a capital-gains cut,
cautioned against concluding that the Jenkins-Archer amendment will
carry the day. ``We are beginning an education campaign'' to point
out issues of fairness in connection with capital gains, Moody said.
   ``Time is on the side of the package that will be worked on by
the chairman,'' said Moody. ``He's very sensitive to the
pressures.''

   Attorneys are haggling over millions of dollars
in the Eastern Airlines' strike-bankruptcy case, but all Beatrice
Lovinger wants is the $3,720 she spent on now-useless Eastern
tickets for her family.
   ``I'm a grandmother,'' Ms. Lovinger, 57, told a public meeting
of Eastern creditors Wednesday. ``It's pretty horrible that big
business can do this to me ... and I can be out this amount of
money. I'm overwrought about it.''
   Ms. Lovinger, who lives in New York, says she purchased 13
tickets for her children and grandchildren in January so they could
fly from New York to Miami for a family gathering in mid-April.
   Eastern's three unions struck March 4, grounding the Miami-based
carrier and forcing it to seek the refuge of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
   Ms. Lovinger joined the thousands of other hapless ticketholders
caught by the strike, hoping a federal bankruptcy court in
Manhattan will make sure Eastern compensates them.
   Continental Airlines, Eastern's sister carrier, has been
honoring Eastern tickets, but Ms. Lovinger said Continental offered
only to put her and relatives on standby status. She wants her
money back or guaranteed seats.
   ``I need the tickets the way I bought them,' she told about 60
Eastern attorneys, creditors, shareholders and employees at Madison
Square Garden's Felt Forum in midtown Manhattan.
   On July 21, Eastern filed a proposed reorganization plan, which
it said would provide for full repayment of the $3.3 billion owed
to all creditors including ticketholders.
   Under the plan, people like Ms. Lovinger could exchange their
tickets for cash with interest or more valuable tickets on the
post-bankruptcy Eastern. But the plan must receive approval by the
bankruptcy court and other creditors first, so Ms. Lovinger could
be in for a long wait.
   ``This example is symptomatic of a problem we see coming up,''
James Flug, an attorney for Consumers Union, said of the
grandmother's case. Flug, who also attended the Eastern meeting,
said Consumers Union has heard of dozens of similar cases.
   Consumers Union, the non-profit consumer advocacy group that
publishes Consumer Reports magazine, has asked the court to require
Eastern to reimburse passengers before the company pays off other
creditors.

   A jury Wednesday rejected Home Shopping
Network's $1.5 billion lawsuit charging GTE Corp. with providing
faulty telephone equipment and instead awarded $100 million to two
GTE subsidiaries for libel and slander.
   The cable television retailer claimed it lost millions of calls
and $500 million in potential sales in 1986 and early 1987 because
GTE telephone equipment it contracted for could not handle the
volume of calls.
   But after a six-week trial at Pinellas County Court, the jury
rejected charges of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of
trust and confidence, and breach of fiduciary duty against the
telecommunications giant.
   Instead it awarded GTE Florida and GTE Communications $50
million each for damages to their reputation and credibility by
Home Shopping Network and its two top executives on charges in a
countersuit by Stamford, Conn.-based GTE.
   HSN was cited for $20 million of the total award with $40
million each against HSN Chairman Roy Speer and President Lowell
Paxson.
   Home Shopping immediately said it would appeal the decisions.
   The jury of four women and two men deliberated for about five
hours over two days.
   ``We are very disappointed with the jury's verdict and we will
appeal the decision immediately,'' said Nando DiFilippo, HSN's
executive vice president and general counsel.
   He said the network would maintain that the court should not
have presented GTE's libel and slander counterclaim to the jury.
   James V. Carideo, GTE Florida vice president and general
counsel, said the verdict reassures ``the integrity of the
companies,'' which the HSN suit ``had put at issue.''
   Home Shopping merchandise may be bought by home viewers only
while the item is being displayed on the screen. The network said
it lost 42 million calls when as much as 50 percent of its incoming
calls never got through to waiting sales operators because of the
allegedlt faulty equipment.
   HSN filed its suit in Septmeber 1987. GTE denied any wrongdoing,
contending there was nothing wrong with its equipment and it had
not misled Home Shopping.
   GTE's countersuit maintained that the electronic retailer blamed
the phone company for financial problems actually caused by
mismanagement. The company argued that over-expansion, competition
and customer dissatisfaction rather than ineffective equipment
triggered HSN losses.
   In one year, the number of Home Shopping subscribers soared from
9 million to 46.5 million, GTE attorney Roy Reardon said.

   RJR Holdings Corp., which acquired RJR Nabisco
Inc. for a record $24.5 billion in April, said Wednesday it lost
$309 million in the second quarter because of costs associated with
the buyout.
   But the company, which is 92.3 percent owned by the buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., said strong performances by its food
and tobacco businesses helped boost its operating income by 24
percent.
   ``We are pleased with the progress we have made in meeting our
objectives for reducing debt,'' said Louis V. Gerstner Jr.,
chairman and chief executive.
   The company has reached agreements to sell about $2.6 billion in
assets, mostly from the sale of five European food companies,
toward its goal of $5.5 billion in asset sales.
   ``At the same time, our core businesses are exceeding
expectations for earnings and cash flow,'' Gerstner said.
   The loss for the three months ended June 30 compared with a
profit of $354 million, or $1.50 a share, at RJR Nabisco a year
earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 4 percent to $3.91 billion from
$3.75 billion.
   But operating income before amortization charges rose to $848
million from $683 million a year earlier. Operatings income from
tobacco rose 16 percent while it was up 40 percent from food
operations.
   For the first six months, the new company lost $518 million in
contrast to a profit of $627 million, or $2.59 a share, a year
earlier at RJR Nabisco.
   Six-month revenue rose to $7.44 billion from $7.04 billion a
year earlier.

<HEAD>Arco Sells Solar Unit to Siemens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said Wednesday it
would sell its Arco Solar subsidiary, which the oil giant had spent
12 years and $200 million building into the largest such operation
in the world.
   The sale to West Germany's Siemens AG, which has teamed up with
Arco in a joint solar venture since 1987, was expected to be
completed this fall, Arco and Siemens said. Terms of the deal
weren't announced.
   Arco Solar, a pet project of former Arco Chairman Robert
Anderson, had never turned a profit. But the company and solar
industry observers said the small, quickly evolving solar industry
continues to show great promise.
   They interpreted the sale as part of a back-to-basics trend in
the U.S. oil industry, and said Siemens, with its
telecommunications, power generation, electronics and other
businesses, can better exploit solar technology than can Arco.
   ``It is a better fit in the Siemens scheme of things ... a
company that is into so many related industries,'' Arco spokesman
Albert Greenstein said. ``Our core business is oil, gas and
petrochemicals, and we feel that Arco Solar is just not part of our
long-term strategy for energy development.''
   Siemens said the Arco operation will help the conglomerate
develop solar energy worldwide as the technology is used
increasingly in isolated areas without power from utilities.
   The solar industry boomed by 35 percent in 1988 to about $185
million in sales worldwide, said solar energy consultant Bob
Johnson. ``At the present time the producers of power modules can't
keep up with demand.''
   Arco Solar had about $30 million of those sales _ a big chunk of
the solar market, but a paltry fraction of the $18.8 billion
generated by Arco, the nation's seventh-largest oil company.
   Arco Solar's devices have ranged from small battery chargers to
power modules for cars, boats, rooftops and mountain communications
relay stations.
   It also operates two solar power ``farms'' in California, a
1-megawatt facility in San Bernardino County and a 6.5-megawatt
facility in San Luis Obispo County. Siemens did not buy those, and
Arco is seeking a buyer, Greenstein said.
   ``I think it's singular how long Arco has maintained interest in
solar,'' said consultant Johnson, of Strategies Unlimited, a
Mountain View, Calif., market research firm that studies solar
electric conversions.
   ``Since 1974 there have been a total of eight U.S. petroleum
companies involved in commercial or research and development of
solar electric. At this present time there remain just two _ Amoco
and Mobil.''
   Amoco's solar subsidiary is Solarex Corp., the second-largest
U.S. solar company with sales Johnson estimated at $18 million last
year. Christopher Pope, a spokesman for the Rockville, Md.,
company, said he remained optimistic about the industry.
   ``The technology has improved dramatically in the last five
years,'' Pope said. ``We've seen about a halving of our prices and
manufacturing volumes are up dramatically.''
   Arco's and Solarex's main products are the panels or ``modules''
that can be wired together in various ways and can be seen atop
many roofs. They also power communications relay stations atop the
Rockies and Andes and ice plants for Egyptian fishermen whose catch
would otherwise rot in the sun, Pope noted.
   Pope said he expects the next market for solar power to be in
small power tools, appliances, outdoor lights and the like, just as
solar-powered hand calculators and watches have become common.
   ``The fact that Siemens is getting into it _ another blue-chip
company _ it's an indication of the viability of the business,''
Pope said.
   Arco Solar, which employs about 400 people, is based in
Camarillo, about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Arco
said Siemens would retain Arco Solar's management and staff,
continue operations in Camarillo and honor all distributor
marketing agreements.
   Since 1987, Arco Solar and Siemens Solar have operated PV
Electric GmbH, making and selling solar products mainly to the auto
industry based on thin film silicon technology licensed from Arco
Solar. The joint venture has a factory in Munich and conducts
research on solar technology.
   Arco chairman and chief executive officer Lodwrick M. Cook said,
``Every effort was made to find a buyer with the management depth,
financial resources, commitment to solar energy and willingness to
retain the current management, staff and facilities. Siemens met
those criteria.''

   Amax Inc. announced plans Wednesday to
acquire Falconbridge Ltd. of Canada for $2.4 billion in cash,
capping a complete financial turnaround for the worldwide mining
company.
   If approved by shareholders, the deal will expand Amax's mining
operations and mark its return to nickel production. Toronto-based
Falconbridge is the world's second-largest nickel producer.
   Amax, the nation's third-largest coal and aluminum producer,
said it has secured financing needed to pay $2.8 billion, or
$36.12{ a share, in Canadian currency for Falconbridge.
   The offer is worth about $2.4 billion, or $30.50, in U.S.
dollars, an Amax spokeswoman said. The acquisition is subject to
approval by Canadian regulatory authorities.
   ``Falconbridge is an excellent organization with quality people
and assets. Its acquisition will complement Amax's current metals
businesses and position the company well to serve growing
markets,'' said Allen Born, Amax's chairman, chief executive and
president.
   Amax earned $741 million on revenue of $4.2 billion in 1988. In
the first six months of this year, the company reported $245.1
million in profits on revenue of $2.06 billion.
   Amax shares closed up 12{ cents Wednesday at $25.50 in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. Trading in
Falconridge shares was delayed until after the Amax announcement.
The stock shot up after it began trading, closing at $36.62{, up
$6.37{, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
   In the last year, Amax sought to expand operations and Born said
it was interested in acquiring natural gas properties.
   The possibility of expansion seemed unlikely in 1985, when Amax
ended four years with $1.7 billion in losses.
   In addition to ill-advised ventures into silver and energy, Amax
rejected lucrative takeover offers from Standard Oil of California,
now Chevron Corp. Its interest payments on debts totaled $200
million a year.
   Born was hired in 1985 from a Canadian mining company to help
turn the company. Amax then sold about half the subsidiaries
contributing to its 1984 losses, pulling out of iron ore, nickel
and agricultural chemicals production. The work force was cut to
nearly half its 1981 peak of 20,385 workers.
   In 1986, Amax began making new acquisitions, particularly in
coal and aluminum. The combination of cuts and purchases returned
Amax to profitability in 1987 and its work force has grown again to
about 20,000 worldwide.
   Falconbridge is an international resource corporation that
explores for, develops, mines, processes and markets metals and
minerals. Its major product is nickel, but it also mines
ferronickel, copper and zinc.
   Falconbridge has 9,500 employees with major operations in
Canada, Norway and the Dominican Republic.
   Amax, a supplier of metals and energy, has as its major products
aluminium, coal, gold and molybdenum.
   The Falconbridge deal is conditioned on acceptance of Amax's
offer by at least two-thirds of Falconbridge shareholders. No
deadline has been set for tendering the company's 79 million fully
diluted shares, the Amax spokeswoman said.
   If the deal goes through, Amax has agreed to make an additional
offer to acquire all untendered shares. Amax recently moved its
headquarters from Greenwich to New York, but maintains corporate
offices here.
   Falconbridge immediately implemented a shareholder rights plan
to defend against hostile offers. The measures would give existing
shareholders the right to purchase additional stock at a bargain
rate if another party acquires at least 15 percent of Falconbridge
stock.
   The so-called ``poison pill'' plan will expire in 120 days if
the deal is not approved by shareholders, Amax and Falconbridge
said in a joint statement.
   The Amax spokeswoman said the company abandoned the nickel
business because it was only a refiner and not a miner. She said
Falconbridge presented Amax with a ``quality position'' in which it
will both mine and refine nickel.

<HEAD>Boeing, Machinists Union Begin Contract Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Boeing Co. and the
Machinists union began talks Wednesday on how much money will go
into the next union contract and how it will be distributed.
   Ron Eldridge, business representative of the Machinists'
District 70 in Wichita, wouldn't reveal the contents of the initial
proposal the union made to the aerospace company. He called it
``fair, reasonable and justified.''
   The Machinists' current 3-year pact with Boeing expires Oct. 3.
   Industry analysts say the union is in a good position to extract
favorable terms from Boeing. A strike is unlikely, they say,
primarily because Boeing is already having difficulty delivering
airplanes on time.
   ``The unions have a heck of a lever this time around,
particularly after being given the wire brush the last two times
around,'' said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Boeing officials declined comment on any aspect of the
negotiations. ``We do not discuss any of that in the press,'' said
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder.
   Eldridge said getting a general wage increase is the top
priority of the union. The Machinists at Boeing have not had a
general wage increase for six years, with the union settling in
each of the last two contracts for lump-sum bonuses.
   Boeing, analysts say, is likely to again offer substantial
bonuses in an attempt to avoid a general wage increase that would
also raise the costs of overtime and benefits, and lock the company
into higher expenses even if economic conditions should turn sour.
   ``What Boeing would like to do is give the employees a part of
the boom times, but not get stuck when the weak times come,'' said
analyst William Whitlow of Dain Bosworth in Seattle, where Boeing
is based.
   The expiring contract paid workers a 12 percent bonus in 1986
and 5 percent the following two years.
   Eldridge said surveys of union members showed that as many as 65
percent of them support the goal of a general wage increase and
that such sentiment was even stronger in Wichita.
   Since the last contract was negotiated three years ago, Boeing
has been amassing record sales and profits on the strength of
unprecedented orders for new airliners.
   Just last week, Boeing announced its earnings for the first six
months of 1989 were $356 million, a 20 percent increase over a year
earlier. The company has nearly $3.7 billion in cash and
investments and an order backlog valued at nearly $68 billion.
   Boeing has until Aug. 9 to make a counterproposal.
   Eldridge said he expects the negotiations to be tough. ``Boeing
has a long history of taking you right down to the wire, and we'll
probably be meeting on Oct. 3,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scripps To Buy Cable TV Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The E.W. Scripps Co. has agreed in principle
to buy nine cable television systems in the Knoxville area and
eastern Tennessee for $100 million, the company announced Wednesday.
   The systems have about 40,000 basic subscribers, the company
said.
   The systems are a portion of those that Intermedia Partners
recently agreed to acquire from Jack Kent Cooke.
   Through its TeleScripps subsidiary, the company already is the
largest cable system operator in the Knoxville area. With the
additional nine systems, Scripps will have more than 105,000 basic
subscribers in the area.
   ``We like the Greater Knoxville area and this is a good
opportunity to expand our presence there,'' said Lawrence A. Leser,
chairman and chief executive officer of Scripps.

<HEAD>Exchanges Move To Bolster Confidence Following Indictments</HEAD>

   Officials at the world's two largest commodities
exchanges moved quickly Wednesday to bolster public confidence
after a federal grand jury indicted 46 traders on charges of making
illegal trades.
   But ordinary traders at bars near the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade in the downtown LaSalle Street
financial district took a more low-key view of the indictments.
   Several traders refused to comment on the indictments, while
others expressed mixed opinions about the federal probe that
resulted in charges ranging from tax fraud to racketeering. Those
traders willing to comment refused to identify themselves.
   ``If they're dirty, then they deserve it,'' one trader shouted
over his shoulder as he walked out of The Trade Inn across from the
Board of Trade building.
   But other traders questioned the validity of the indictments,
which resulted from a 2{-year undercover FBI investigation at the
two exchanges. The charges involve such violations as pre-arranged
trading, altering trading records and withholding customer orders
from the market in order to dole them out to compatriots.
   From the indictments emerge a picture of several dozen traders,
none of whom are considered especially influential, who allegedly
conspired to skim profits from customers' accounts and hide the
profits from the Internal Revenue Service.
   Some traders at the Limit Up Bar in the Mercantile Exchange
building portrayed several of those indicted as basically honest
brokers who were not smart enough to cheat.
   ``There are things that look real dishonest that are done for
the good of the customers,'' said one trader, who has been a member
of the Mercantile Exchange for 10 years. He refused to elaborate on
what practices he meant.
   The trader said he thought the federal investigation has focused
so far on traders who had done little wrong.
   ``They're taking honest people and turning them into crooks,''
said the trader. ``If they're looking for something bigger, that's
fine, great.''
   The trader and two colleagues sitting at the bar denied ever
breaking exchange rules and defended the record of most traders.
   ``That's very good if all they can find is 24 bad apples'' out
of the 2,724 seats on the Mercantile exchange, he said.
   The government announced indictments of 22 traders at the Board
of Trade and 24 at the Merc. The exchanges were not accused of
wrongdoing and neither were any of the scores of brokerage firms
whose customers were allegedly cheated.
   Officials at both exchanges said those traders under indictment
would be barred from trading except for their own personal accounts.
   When asked about the number of indictments, CBOT Chairman
Karsten Mahlmann told a news conference that ``one was too many''
and vowed to protect the integrity of the exchange.
   Mahlmann said the CBOT had launched its own investigation of
traders before reports about the FBI probe surfaced in January, but
was asked by federal authorities to hold off while the government
investigation continued.
   CBOT President Thomas Donovan said the exchange has since moved
to improve its computer surveillance system so that it will be able
to audit all transactions within one business day and stiffen its
maximum fines for violations from $75,000 to $250,000.
   Donovan said the board would conduct its own investigation into
the practices of the indicted traders and revoke the trading
privileges of anyone who pleads guilty or is convicted on charges
stemming from the probe.
   ``Without integrity being a major part of the way we do
business, we cannot exist,'' Donovan told the news conference.
   At the Merc, Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee,
and John T. Geldermann, chairman of the board of governors, issued
a statement promising to deal ``severely'' with any member found
guilty of the federal charges.
   They said the Merc had commissioned a special committee to
review all trading practices.

   Ted Turner on Wednesday credited his new
all-movie cable channel, Turner Network Television, with boosting
Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s revenues and profit in the second
quarter.
   Atlanta-based TBS reported net income of $5.5 million for the
quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $25.9 million for
the same quarter a year earlier.
   However, it reported a net loss per common share of 12 cents in
this year's second quarter due to the payment of dividends and the
accumulation of discount on its Class B preferred stock.
   Quarterly revenues were up 33 percent, to $264.5 million from
$199.3 million.
   For the six months ended June 30, net income was $5.1 million,
or a loss of 37 cents a share after an extraordinary item, compared
with a loss of $40 million for the same period in 1988. Revenues
were $496.5 million, up 30 percent from revenues of $381.9 million
for the same period a year earlier.
   ``The addition of TNT to our already successful lineup of basic
cable networks has lifted our quarterly operating profit to an
all-time high,'' said Turner, chairman of TBS.
   ``We are particularly pleased that our improved performance is
the result of contributions from all four basic cable networks,
confirming our belief that each network remains attractive to
advertisers and viewers alike,'' he said.
   In addition to TNT, TBS owns Cable News Network, CNN Headline
News and Superstation WTBS. The company also owns professional
baseball's Atlanta Braves and professional basketball's Atlanta
Hawks.
