<HEAD>Federal Auditors Searching For $7 Million in Denver HUD Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than $7 million in proceeds from the sale of
foreclosed homes may be missing from the Department of Housing and
Urban and Development's regional office here, federal auditors say.
   However, HUD's regional chief said the files that will account
for the money are simply in storage and are being recovered.
   The Denver HUD office is a major focus of a nationwide inquiry of
wrongdoing at HUD during the Reagan administration under
then-Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   The agency has been rocked by allegations that money to
rehabilitate run-down housing for the poor and elderly was handed
out to developers who hired high-priced consultants with ties to the
Republican Party or the administration.
   In addition, an escrow agent in Maryland has said she embezzled
$5 million in money due the government from the sale of foreclosed
property and gave most of the proceeds to the poor. Investigators
have dubbed Mary Louise Harrell ``Robin HUD.''
   An auditor's report released Tuesday raised the possibility that
the Denver office may not have received $7,279,136.
   Federal auditors have given the office eight days to come up with
the missing records on 173 foreclosed homes sold in the past five
years, or face sanctions.
   HUD regional officials knew the files were missing as early as
Feb. 9, according to the report by the HUD inspector general's
office. The report indicates the investigation into single-family
home sales handled by the office began in January.
   The report said 471 home sales were chosen by auditors for
review, but records on 173 couldn't be found.
   According to the report, documentation that proceeds were
transferred to HUD bank accounts was lacking for many other sales.
   Isaiah ``Ike'' Kelley, acting HUD administrator in Denver, said
the files, which have been missing since February, are stored in
agency's archives.
   Kelley said the audit covered home sales from 1984 to 1988.
   ``I don't know what happened back then, but I can tell you that
as acting administrator I will make sure the regional inspector
general obtains those files immediately,'' said Kelley, who took
over in April.
   Earlier this month, a HUD accountant in Denver, Douglas Turner,
was suspended on suspicion of diverting $1 million to his own
account.
   The auditors' report accused regional officials of lax
record-keeping.
   Auditors complained they found active and inactive files together
and that boxes of records were allowed to sit open at the regional
office for indefinite periods before being put in storage.
   The report also criticized the practice of not requiring private
agents who sell foreclosed properties for HUD to confirm that
proceeds were deposited in HUD bank accounts. Normally when a HUD
home is sold, the proceeds are wired immediately to the agency's
Washington office.
   ``Of the 256 sales packages examined, 145 did not have wire
transfer confirmations,'' the report said.

   Two black candidates won races for
judgeships Tuesday in an election ordered by a federal judge who
said Mississippi's judicial districts discriminated against blacks.
   One other black candidate was narrowly leading, one was trailing
and two others lost election bids. Two blacks were unopposed as a
result of the court order that forced the redrawing of judicial
districts. Prior to the election, Mississippi had four black judges.
   Also on the ballot were three proposed constitutional amendments
to repeal outdated and unused provisions. One would eliminate the
poll tax, adopted to discourage black voting but struck down by the
U.S. Supreme Court in 1966.
   The four blacks among Mississippi's 78 judges are Supreme Court
Justice Reuben Anderson, Circuit Judges Fred L. Banks Jr. and Lillie
Blackmon-Sanders and Chancery Judge Isaac Byrd.
   Each was appointed to fill a vacancy, but Anderson went on to win
a full eight-year term in 1986. Byrd did not seek election this
year. The two others sought regular terms Tuesday.
   With 79 of 85 precincts reporting Tuesday night, Blackmon-Sanders
trailed Republican challenger Richard Watson by 8,265 votes to
10,917. Banks and one other black Democrat, Isadore W. Patrick of
Vicksburg, were unopposed in the general election.
   The two black winners were Pat Wise, a Democrat, who defeated
Republican Billy W. Keyes for an open Hinds County chancery judge's
post by 5,942 votes to 1,638; and Denise Sweet Owens, also Democrat,
who defeated Republican George M. Arthur in another open family
court post in the county, 4,628 votes to 1,259.
   With only five of 37 precincts reporting in the Fourth District,
Solomon Curtis Osborne, a black Democrat, was leading independent
incumbent Circuit Judge Gray Evans in the Fourth District, 395 votes
to 348.
   But Clell G. Ward, a black Democrat, was defeated by independent
incumbent Circuit Judge Howard Q. Davis Jr. in the Fourth District,
4,046 votes to 2,063.
   Another black candidate, Harold Brittain, also a Democrat, ran
fourth in a four-way race for two judgeship posts in the 20 Circuit
Court District. The winners were incumbents Robert L. Goza, a
Democrat, and Alfred Nichols, a Republican.
   In 1987, U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. ruled that
the state's judicial districts discriminated against blacks. The
ruling, the first to apply the 1965 Voting Rights Act to judicial
elections, was upheld on appeal.
   Barbour ordered some districts redrawn to create minority
subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to
elect black judges.
   The ruling and appeals put judicial elections in the state on
hold until this year, when all 69 Circuit Court and Chancery Court
judgeships are being filled. No Supreme Court judgeships are on the
ballot.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
postponed action on three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees
Tuesday after Democrats complained their only visible qualifications
are large GOP contributions.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., initiated the delay when he complained
that U.S. ambassadors should have at least some qualifications for
the job.
   The Senate is set to close down for the Independence Day recess,
so Sarbanes' request for a one-week delay effectively stops until
mid July at the earliest any action on the nominations to fill
ambassadorships in Spain, Australia and New Zealand.
   ``In the past we've had to hold our noses'' and let similar
nominees with political connections go through, Sarbanes said. ``But
eventually someone ought to say stop.''
   ``If it's going to be a bidding war ... at least we should put it
up for public bids so the money goes to the U.S. Treasury,''
Sarbanes said.
   Sarbanes targeted three. They are:
   _Joseph Zappala, a Florida land developer and national
co-chairman of Bush's fund raising committee who has been nominated
to be U.S. ambassador to Spain. Sarbanes said he contributed
$126,000 to the Bush campaign.
   _Marvin Sembler, a Florida shopping center tycoon who has been
named to be ambassador to Australia. Sarbanes said Sembler was a
$127,000 Bush contributor.
   _Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., residential real estate broker
who has been nominated to be ambassador to New Zealand. She is a
long-time personal friend of Bush and was chairman of the Washington
State Bush For President Committee. Sarbanes said she had no
apparent qualifications except her personal and political ties.
   ``There seems to be a $100,000 threshhold'' for ambassadorships,
Sarbanes said.
   Sarbanes did ``reluctantly'' permit the committee to approve the
nomination of C. Howard Wilkins Jr., a $115,000 contributor to the
Bush campaign. Wilkins has been named to be ambassador to the
Netherlands and with the committee's action, an ambassador will be
in place when Bush visits the country next month.
   The full Senate later approved the Wilkins nomination on a voice
vote.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., defended the records of the two
Floridians on Sarbanes' list saying, ``to imply they are not capable
is a disservice.''
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said: ``What we're doing is
delaying the appropriate representation this country should have
overseas.''
   And Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the overall composition of
Bush's ambassadorial nominees to date is no different than the
choices of the Reagan administration's two-thirds Foreign Service
professionals and one third political appointees.
   ``These nominees are friends of the president, a part of the
organization of his coming to the presidency,'' Lugar said. ``They
share his ethos, his idealism and they will be so perceived in the
nations to which they are being sent.''
   Sarbanes said he has no objection to political nominees as such,
as long as they can claim some qualifications for the posts to which
they are named. He noted he did not object to Bush's nomination of
former Republican Gov. Robert D. Orr of Indiana to be ambassador to
Singapore.
   He said Orr had demonstrated his capabilities during his eight
years service as governor beginning in 1980.
   The committee did vote to recommend the Senate confirm Orr and a
list of other nominees.
   They are:
   _Thomas Niles, named to be U.S. representative to the European
Community.
   _Morton I. Abramowitz, to be ambassador to Turkey.
   _Edward N. Ney, to be ambassador to Canada.
   _Richard H. Solomon, to be assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs.
   _Melvyn Levitsky, to be assistant secretary of state for
international narcotics matters.
   _Jewel S. Lafontant, to be ambassador-at-large for refugee
affairs.
   _E. Patrick Coady, to be U.S. executive director for the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
   _Mark L. Edelman, to be deputy administrator of the Agency for
International Development.
   _Fred M. Zeder II, to be president of the Overseas Private
Investment Corp.

   Fashionably dressed race goers at the opening of
the four-day Royal Ascot meet sweltered in 88-degree heat and more
than 50 collapsed, first-aid workers reported.
   ``We've been very, very busy,'' said Patricia Gates of the St.
John Ambulance Brigade's volunteer corps. She said most of the
victims on Tuesday suffered mild sunstroke or fainted.
   It was the hottest June day in 13 years and the champagne stalls
were busy. The price of a bottle ranged from $33 to $70.
   Half a cold lobster cost $15.50, a serving of salmon $12.40 and
strawberries and clotted cream $3.10.
   Queen Elizabeth II, in a pink and turquoise silk-crepe dress and
straw hat, strolled through the crowds between the royal enclosure
where the elegant parade and the paddock where the horses are
paraded.
   Rules barring anyone under age 16 from the royal enclosure until
Friday, the closing day, were broken to admit the queen's 8-year-old
granddaughter, Zara Phillips, the daughter of Princess Anne.
   ``After all, the queen makes the rules,'' said a member of the
royal household. A spokesman for the Ascot Authority noted Ascot is
the monarch's racecourse.
   Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, left Ascot early to play
polo in nearby Windsor Great Park. Princess Diana went with him but
left after the first match.

   The technology behind the Walkman portable
cassette-player might never have developed without these words from
Sony Chairman Akio Morita: ``TURN DOWN THAT MUSIC!''
   Morita, seeking to soften his children's blasting stereos, asked
his development team for something that would let the kids rock out
without deafening dad. Working from a model developed by Sony
founder Masuru Ibuka, model TPS-L2 rolled off the assembly line a
year later _ the first Sony Walkman, unveiled July 1, 1979.
   In the decade since, the Walkman and its imitators have become
ubiquitous, with tiny headphones appearing on millions of heads
worldwide _ traffic-bound commuters, long-distance runners and
house-cleaning parents as well as their rock 'n' rolling kids.
   ``The Sony Walkman has in fact changed the way the world listens
to music,'' said Tom Harvey, president of the Sony Consumer Audio
Product Company. ``It's changed our lifestyles.''
   Go argue. As the Walkman marks its 10th birthday, it has become a
cultural phenomenon, as American as Toyotas or sushi. Highlights of
the Walkman's first decade include:
   _ Walkman: A Space Odyssey. A specially adapted Walkman was sent
into orbit attached to astronaut Jake Garn, recording the sounds of
his bowels for posterity. This was a scientific experiment (really).
   _ Illegal Walkman. Teachers at the University of Illinois were
warned of students using Walkmans (Walkmen?) to play ``oral crib
sheets'' during tests.
   _ Walkman: The Movie. Michael J. Fox, blasting an Eddie van Halen
guitar solo through a Walkman, convinced his '50s-bound father there
was life on other planets in ``Back to the Future.''
   _ The Royal Walkman. Princess Diana owns a gold-plated number
that she plays while relaxing in Buckingham Palace.
   The Walkman wasn't an immediate sensation. Initially it was
called Soundabout in the United States, Stowaway in the United
Kingdom, Freestyle in Sweden and Walkman in Japan and other world
markets.
   But Morita argued for uniformity, and sales in the United States,
37,000 units in 1979, took off after the Walkman name was adopted in
May 1980. From then on, the personal stereo cassette deck was up and
running.
   ``Retailers told us, `You guys are absolutely out of your minds.
It doesn't even recod, and it costs $200. It's never going to go
anywhere,''' Harvey said. ``The next thing I know, we've got back
orders for 1{ years.''
   Dozens of competitors from Panasonic to General Electric
recognized a good thing and began manufacturing their own brands.
   By 1982, Time magazine was hailing the Walkman as the gadget of
the year. By 1984, Sony had cranked out 10 million which climbed to
30 million by 1987. Today, there are more than 50 million _ about
half of them worn in the U.S.A.
   While the first model had a retail price of $199.95, today's
Walkman prices run as low as $14.95 for an FM, radio-only model.
There are 44 Sony models: water-resistant, with AM-FM radios, with
recording capability, built for the outdoorsman. Television freaks
now have the Watchman, a tiny portable TV set; die-hard audiophiles
have the Discman, a portable CD player.
   Meanwhile, the trademarked Walkman name entered everyday language
as a synonym for a personal stereo, just as Kleenex came to stand
for a facial tissue. Walkman is even an entry in the dictionary.
   Birthday celebrations for the Walkman include one of the
originals going on permanent display at the Hard Rock Cafe in New
York City, and Tiffany's will produce 36 special Walkmans to be
presented to as-yet-unchosen innovators in music and technology.

<HEAD>Defense Ministry Says Romania Builds Border Wire Fence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says Romania has nearly
completed construction of a 6-foot barbed wire fence along its
border with Hungary, but cast doubt on a foreign press report that a
brick wall is being built.
   The Times of London on Monday reported that Bucharest is building
a wall along its border with Hungary and Yugoslavia to prevent
defections.
   Hungary's official MTI news agency said Tuesday that its border
guards had reported ``no signs of wall construction.''
   ``Nevertheless, a 2{-meter wire fence is being set up on the
Romanian side of the border ... which has been completed along 90
percent of the border length,'' the agency said.
   ``Since it appears to be an ordinary wire fence, the (Hungarian)
border guards suppose that no electricity will be led into it,'' the
agency said. It added that the fence is about 80 feet inside
Romanian territory.
   ``The latest works indicate that ditches have been dug on both
sides of the fence to prevent breakthroughs by cars,'' MTI said.
   Romania's border with Hungary extends 275 miles.
   An estimated 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians,
have fled to Hungary in the past few years seeking refuge from
chronic hardships under the regime of President Nicolae Ceausescu.
Ethnic Hungarians also claim discriminatory policies toward
minorities in Romania.
   During the first five months of this year, 3,231 Romanians
crossed ilegally into Hungary, deputy Interior Minister Zoltan Gal
said last week.
   He said the Cabinet would soon discuss plans to open three
refugees camps in eastern Hungary to cope with the influx.

<HEAD>Ivory Bans Increasing After Years of Crusades</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of crusades to stop poachers from
destroying the African elephant, conservationists are reaping
success with a series of national bans on ivory imports.
   ``It's been a real snowball effect,'' said Jorgen Thomsen, senior
program officer for elephant conservation at the World Wildlife Fund.
   Since June 4, the United States, Japan, the 12-nation European
Economic Community, Switzerland and Canada have imposed bans on
imported ivory. The EEC, Japan and the United States buy up to 75
percent of the ivory on world markets.
   Hong Kong, the world's major ivory dealer, has announced a
moratorium on raw ivory imports.
   The 102-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species will consider a worldwide ban at a Geneva meeting in October.
   The conservationists' sweeping success follows June 1 appeals by
the World Wildlife Fund and Wildlife Conservation International. The
two groups said poachers were wiping out the elephant populations in
Africa faster than had been thought and the pachyderms could be
extinct within 15 years.
   But conservationists now fear that prospects of a worldwide ban
could lead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killings unless interim
measures are taken immediately.
   ``An elephant holocaust across Africa is likely unless consumer
countries take immediate action,'' the World Wildlife Fund said.
   France, on June 4, began the string of national actions against
importing ivory and it was followed the next day by the United
States.
   Penalties vary for violations. In the United States, the maximum
is a year in jail and a $100,000 fine.
   President Bush, in announcing the U.S. decision, said: ``We do
this out of mounting concern for the rapid decline of the wild
elephant, one of nature's most majestic creatures.
   ``If their populations continue to diminish at current rates, the
wild elephant will soon be lost from this Earth.''
   Japan and Hong Kong are considered critical to any effective
reduction in ivory demand. Japan is the largest importer, accounting
for 40 percent of the world market, and Hong Kong is heavily
involved in making ivory carvings for export.
   ``The real victory is Japan,'' Thomsen said. ``Hong Kong's action
was very much to save face'' because its two biggest customers _
Japan and the United States _ had outlawed imports.
   ``This proves that we have taken more responsibility as consumer
countries,'' he said. ``We may have prevented a catastrophe. Credit
should also be placed with the African countries, who previously had
opposed a ban but now realize the crisis situation.''
   Hong Kong began enforcing its crackdown quickly. On Sunday, it
seized 448 tusks and other ivory products worth an estimated $2.6
million that officials said were to to have been smuggled to Japan.
   Several African countries recently reversed their stands and took
steps to protect their elephants. Last month, Kenya followed
neighboring Tanzania and Somalia and called for a worldwide ban.
   Delegates at an Organization of African Unity conference that
ended Saturday recommended establishing a marketing cartel to ensure
that money from the worldwide ivory trade benefits the continent.
   Conservationists estimate African elephant populations have
dropped from 1.5 million in 1978 to between 400,000 and 700,000
today.
   They say ivory exports have increased from 300 tons a year in the
1950s to more than 800 tons annually in this decade and prices are
running at a record $91 per pound.
   An aerial survey last year found about 20,000 elephants in Kenya.
Fifteen years ago it had 121,000. The number of elephants in
Tanzania has fallen to 80,000 from 300,000 in 1979, according to
government officials.
   Conservationists say the elephant populations in most other
African countries have suffered similar fates, but Zimbabwe,
Botswana and South Africa are the exceptions because of controls.
   Zimbabwe has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade in
elephant products. In the last 12 months it earned about $600,000 in
legal ivory sales.
   Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in some
countries and now their targets are females and young beasts,
according to a conservationists' report released this month.
   The result is that three times as many elephants must be killed
to provide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago.
   ``The annual ivory haul must be reduced to at least a tenth of
its present volume to enable populations to recover,'' the report
says. ``The recovery of herds and family structure will take 20
years or more if all poaching were stopped.''
   Japan, Hong Kong and other countries with thriving ivory
industries and markets would be badly hurt if supplies are reduced
to that level.
   Tamotsu Ishibashi, chairman of the Tokyo Ivory and Craft
Cooperative Association, said even the current ban will have
devastating effects on Japan's traditional ivory-carving industry.
He said some 25,000 craftsman in about 80 workshops produce $13.8
million worth of ivory products every year.
   ``The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of
carving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restriction
certainly will affect them severely,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall, found guilty Tuesday on nine
counts of lying to a federal grand jury about a money-laundering
scheme, is the 20th person in the last decade to be indicted on
criminal charges while serving in Congress.
   Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, 58, was convicted May 26 of
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor, a
misdemeanor. The Franklin County, Ohio, jury found him guilty of
having sex with the girl last November.
   Lukens faces up to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine for his
conviction, but conviction on the misdemeanor charge does not
automatically preclude him from serving in the House or seeking
re-election, and he has said he will remain in Congress while
appealing his conviction.
   Lukens is in the second term of his second stint in Congress. He
also was in Congress for two terms from 1967 to 1971.
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., was indicted in New York on
conspiracy charges in the Wedtech corruption scandal. He was the
second Democratic congressman from New York to be indicted for
allegedly using his influence on behalf of the Wedtech Corp., a
minority-owned New York City machine shop that won no-bid U.S. Army
contracts. It has since gone bankrupt.
   Mario Biaggi, whose former congressional district abuts Garcia's,
was convicted last Aug. 5 of racketeering, mail fraud and accepting
bribes from Wedtech in exchange for his Washington influence.
Biaggi, 71, resigned his House seat Aug. 6 after nearly 10 terms. He
was sentenced to eight years in prison and a $242,000 fine.
   Biaggi also was convicted in November 1987 of accepting an
illegal gratuity _ a paid vacation _ for helping an ailing New York
shipyard. He was sentenced to 2{ years in prison and fined $500,000
in that case.
   In October 1988, Fofo I.F. Sunia, American Samoa's former
delegate to Congress, was sentenced to five to 15 months in prison
for participating in a payroll-padding scheme that reportedly earned
him $39,000. Sunia, 51, a Democrat, resigned his congressional seat
Sept. 6.
   Other members of Congress indicted since 1978:
   _Rep. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn., charged in April 1987 with bank,
mail and tax fraud. No trial date has been set.
   _Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, R-Calif., indicted Jan. 23, 1986, along with
an aide on charges she tried to buy off an opponent for the GOP
Senate nomination in California. The charges subsequently were
dismissed by a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles; Fiedler lost the
primary.
   _Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, indicted in April 1983 and
convicted one year later on charges of violating the 1978 Ethics in
Government Act by failing to report $333,978 in loans and other
transactions on his financial disclosure forms. Hansen was freed in
October 1987 after serving nearly one year of a five-to-15-month
sentence.
   _Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., convicted in May 1981 on
charges stemming from the FBI's Abscam investigation, including
conspiracy, bribery, conflict of interest, receiving an unlawful
gratuity and interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise.
   Williams resigned from the Senate in March 1982. He was paroled
from a halfway house in January 1986 after serving nearly two years
of a three-year sentence.
   Six House members also were indicted as a result of the
undercover Abscam investigation, and all served prison terms. They
were:
   Rep. Raymond Lederer, D-Pa.; Rep. Michael ``Ozzie'' Myers, D-Pa.;
Rep. John Jenrette, D-S.C.; Rep. John Murphy, D-N.Y.; Rep. Frank
Thompson, D-N.J.; and Rep. Richard Kelly, R-Fla.
   _Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, D-La., was indicted in July 1979 on
charges of buying votes in the 1978 election and violating federal
campaign finance laws. He was acquitted of some vote-buying counts
and the others were dropped, and a federal appeals court dismissed
the charges of campaign finance law violations.
   _Rep. Joshua Eilberg, D-Pa., indicted in October 1978 on federal
charges of illegally receiving compensation to help a Philadelphia
hospital get a $14.5 million federal grant. He pleaded guilty in
February 1979 and was sentenced to five years' probation and fined
$10,000.
   _Rep. Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa., indicted in the fall of 1978 on 13
counts of bribery, conspiracy and perjury. His trial on 11 counts
ended in a mistrial in February 1979. He resiged from the House in
January 1980, citing health reasons, after the House ethics
committee accused him of 25 rules violations. In February 1980, he
pleaded guilty to conspiracy in a plea-bargaining arrangement and
was given a year's probation.
   _Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr., D-Mich., indicted in March 1978 and
convicted in October 1978 on 29 felony counts of illegally diverting

<HEAD>Palme Trial Raises Questions About Unusual Swedish Press Ethics</HEAD>

   Swedes may not learn the name or see the
face of the man accused of killing Prime Minister Olof Palme if they
read only their national newspapers.
   Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson, who is on trial for the 1986
shooting, is known in Sweden only as ``the 42-year-old.''
   Under Swedish press law, the identity of a criminal suspect is
never published unless he is convicted and sentenced, and even then
it must clearly be in the public interest.
   The regulations are meant to protect the innocent, and a
newspaper and its senior editor can be fined for violating them.
   But the Palme murder trial has put the regulations under a
strain, and several provincial papers are disregarding them.
   ``Christer Pettersson is a historic person, whether guilty or
not,'' said Per Ahlstrom, editor of Nya Norrland, a daily with a
circulation of 20,000 in the northern town of Harnosand.
   ``I find that there is evident public interest that the name of
the person accused of the murder becomes public knowledge,'' he said.
   International news agencies and foreign newspapers published
Pettersson's identity and his police mug shot when he was charged in
December.
   Swedish papers ran into difficulty when Pettersson, known as
``the 41-year-old'' at the time, had a birthday in April. For a few
weeks he was referred to as ``the 42-year-old former 41-year-old.''
   About 20 newspapers have flouted the regulations, arguing it was
ridiculous to try to hide his identity when foreign newspapers
reporting the trial were available at major newsstands in Sweden.
   Other ironies also have become evident.
   Under Swedish freedom of information laws, Pettersson's name was
available after prosecutors filed the indictment last month. Anyone
who calls the Stockholm District Court can ask the court clerk to
read it over the telephone.
   Papers that have refrained from identifying Pettersson have, at
the same time, published every detail of his life, including his
police record, the location of his home and interviews with former
girlfriends.
   Kevin Boyle, director of the London-based ``Article 19,'' which
monitors press freedom in 50 countries, said the Swedish regulations
are ``highly exceptional'' if not unique.
   ``It is remarkable in that it contradicts the openness of
information in so many other areas where Sweden leads the world,''
Boyle said in an interview.
   He said the restrictions do not violate international law, but
they could inhibit the search for witnesses.
   Because of high public interest in the Palme case, the court let
Swedish Radio broadcast the trial with a one-second delay to allow a
technician to cover Pettersson's name with an electronic beep.
   The technician missed the beat the first time Pettersson's name
was mentioned, however.
   The broadcasts have been debated heatedly.
   Professor Carl Magnus Elwing of the University of Lund said they
have turned the trial into ``marketplace theater'' and diminished
the stature of the court. ``I would have acted forcefully to stop
it,'' Elwing said.
   Some critics said testimony heard on the radio could influence
subsequent witnesses.
   Presiding Judge Carl-Anton Spak ruled the broadcasts were in line
with the law and would be stopped only if they disturbed the trial
itself.
   Since then most of the witnesses, many of whom have criminal
records, have demanded that the broadcast be halted for their
testimony and the court has complied.
   Press Ombudsman Torsten Cars, who is employed by the newspaper
industry, said the caution regarding Pettersson's name goes beyond
the requirements of press ethics.
   ``It would not change much if the name were printed, considering
all the descriptions of his life that already have been published,''
he said. ``And there are thousands of Christer Petterssons in
Sweden. ... Publishing the picture is more serious.''
   Among those publishing the name is the newspaper Arbetet in
Malmo, a city across the Oregrund straits from Denmark, where such
restrictions do not apply.
   Arbetet was convicted of libel in 1987 and ordered to pay $27,000
in compensation to ``the 33-year-old,'' a suspect who earlier was
detained and released without charges.

   A 19th-century painting set in ancient Rome of a
young woman about to bathe has been sold at auction for $153,450 _
nearly 20,000 times its 1956 purchase price of $8.
   ``It certainly does reflect an extraordinary change in taste, but
that isn't unique in art,'' said Sotheby's Simon Taylor after the
sale Tuesday of ``Diadumene'' by Sir Edward Poynter.
   The auction house had expected more because of the vogue for
once-neglected Victorian works. It had estimated the painting would
fetch up to $232,500.
   Poynter, in 1885, had painted the young woman nude but he added
diaphanous drapery after it was exhibited at the Royal Academy of
Arts and provoked letters from shocked viewers.
   One letter to the press, signed ``British Matron,'' said the
writer had barred her daughters from going to the the exhibition.
Another letter said the painting would produce a ``burning sense of
shame'' in any ``modest woman on the arm of father, brother or
lover.''
   Poynter was known for such paintings but his most famous work,
reproduced in the tens of thousands in its day, was ``Faithful unto
Death.'' It depicted a Roman sentry staying at his post during the
destruction of Pompeii by the Vesuvius volcano.
   The seller and buyer of ``Diadumene'' were not identified.
   The painting had been auctioned in 1956 at a sale of the contents
of Ashley Manor, owned by Lady Agnes Chichester Dixon-Hartland.
   Top price at Tuesday's auction of 19th century European art was
$2.3 million _ more than double the estimate _ paid anonymously for
``Grandfather's Birthday,'' a family fireside scene by Austrian
artist Ferdinand Georg Waldmueller. It was a record for his work.

   A heartbroken husband shot and killed his
estranged wife Tuesday in their divorce attorney's office, then
turned the gun on himself as the couple's two young girls sat in the
waiting room.
   Jose Luis Martinez, 38, shot his wife Josephine, also 38, four
times in the head with a .32-caliber revolver, threatened to shoot
the attorney, then shot himself in the head, according to police and
the attorney's secretary.
   Mrs. Martinez was declared dead at Jamaica Hospital.
   Martinez was in extremely poor condition at the same hospital and
will likely be declared brain dead after tests are completed
Wednesday, said administrative nursing supervisor Robert Stewart.
   The couple, who had been married since 1973, had come to the
office of John J. Napolitano in Queens on Tuesday afternoon for an
initial consultation about a divorce, according to Napolitano's
secretary, Susan Dasaro.
   They went into the attorney's office and closed the door, leaving
their 8-year-old and 6-year-old girls in the reception area. ``The
father told them to wait out here,'' Dasaro said.
   ``She said she no longer loved him; he said he loved her a great
deal,'' Napolitano said afterward.
   Napolitano said he served the divorce summons on Martinez and
told him to get an attorney.
   ``Then he stood up, put his right hand behind his back and pulled
out a gun,'' Napolitano said. ``She sat down, she pleaded for her
life.''
   He put the gun, identified by police as a .32-caliber, against
her left temple and fired once.
   Napolitano said Martinez then alternated between firing
additional shots into Mrs. Martinez and threatening him, shoving the
gun against Napolitano's chest, head and mouth.
   ``He then said he was going to kill me and kill himself,''
Napolitano, 58, said. After about five minutes, Martinez put the gun
to his face and shot himself.
   ``We heard the gunshots and at first we didn't know what it was''
since the office is located near a busy intersection, Dasaro said.
``After the third one that I heard, we realized that it was coming
from the office.
   ``We ran out and we dragged the little girls out.''
   Dasaro said they waited outside the office on the street about 10
minutes before Napolitano emerged.
   ``I thought John was dead too,'' she said. ``Then he came out and
he just shook his head.''
   The girls ``did not witness the murder,'' she said, but were
``crying hysterically.'' One saw the bodies being carried out.
   A 12-year-old son was not at the office at the time, said Officer
Hugh Barry, a police spokesman. The children will probably be turned
over to child welfare workers, he said.

   Picket lines in the 7-week-old strike at Central
Park's posh restaurant, Tavern on the Green, came down Tuesday after
striking workers tentatively accepted a five-year contract.
   ``We're delighted,'' said restaurant spokesman John Scanlon. ``We
think it's a fair settlement, we're glad that it's over and we want
to see all of our regular customers back here as soon as possible.''
   Under the offer, wages will increase 27 percent the first year
and about 5 percent each of the four years that follow.
   ``A 27 percent raise the first year is not a bad wage increase,''
said John Turchiano, a spokesman for Local 6 of the Hotel Employees
and Restaurant Employees International Union.
   The union represented nearly 300 dishwashers, busboys, waiters
and other workers who walked off the job April 30. The members are
likely to ratify the contract when they vote on it Wednesday,
Turchiano said.
   Tavern on the Green is a tourist mecca, known for its glittering
garden, rococo decor and posh banquets.

   NBC completed a 52-week sweep of Nielsen ratings
despite CBS' broadcast of the final game of the Detroit Pistons'
sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers for the NBA championship.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the No. 1 show last week, but NBC had an
average, prime-time rating of 11.6. CBS had 10.2 and ABC 9.2.
   The last time NBC lost a week was to CBS, the week of the seventh
game of last year's National Basketball Association championship,
when the Lakers beat the Pistons. This year, game four ranked fourth
in the A.C. Nielsen Co. prime-time ratings, with a 17.4 rating and
31 share.
   NBC's average rating for the 52 weeks was 14.4. CBS and ABC tied
with 11.6.
   The top 10 shows during the past year were: ``Roseanne'' ABC,
``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC,
``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``Empty Nest'' NBC, ``Dear
John'' NBC, ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC and ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS.
   NBC has had eight of the top 10 shows 10 times during the past
year. ``Cosby'' was first in the Nielsens for 16 of the 52 weeks,
but ranked second behind ``Roseanne'' for the year _ and third
behind ``Roseanne'' and ``Cheers'' last week. ``Cosby'' had a lower
rating and higher share, because it is on at 8 p.m. EDT, when there
are fewer people watching TV than at 9 p.m., when ``Roseanne'' is on.
   The rating is a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes in
the United States that have televisions. The share is a percentage
of sets in use. A show can have a lower rating and higher share than
another show by getting a larger percentage of a smaller available
audience.
   NBC said another reason ``Cosby'' fell behind ``Roseanne'' for
the year was because the newer ABC show did not have to factor in a
summer of reruns.
   The top 10 shows last week were: ``Roseanne'' ABC, ``Cheers''
NBC, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Detroit Pistons vs. Los Angeles
Lakers'' CBS, ``Perry Mason: The Case of the Murdered Madam'' NBC,
``A Different World'' NBC, ``Empty Nest'' NBC, ``Dear John'' NBC,
``Golden Girls'' NBC, and ``Unsolved Mysteries'' NBC, tied with
``Newhart'' on CBS.
   In a demonstration that time period makes the show, ABC's ``Have
Faith'' tied for 15th when it was on Tuesday behind ``Roseanne.''
But when it was moved into ABC's low-rated Sunday lineup, it fell to
76th and was the lowest-rated network show.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' continued to lag in news ratings, even with
anchorman Tom Brokaw in China. ``CBS Evening News'' and ``ABC World
News Tonight'' tied for first place with a 9.3 rating each and 20
share each. NBC had an average rating of 8.6 and a 19 share.

   Actress Jane Fonda was unharmed after
becoming separated from companions in Sequoia National Park and
spending the night alone on a mountain, her spokesman said.
   Fonda didn't panic when she realized she was lost Sunday, said
her publicist, Steve Rivers. She wrapped herself in an insulated
blanket and ate a sandwich while she awaited help, he said.
   Fonda hiked ahead of her six companions and apparently took a
wrong turn, said Bill Tweed, a spokesman for the park 40 miles east
of Fresno.
   Her companions notified park officials when she failed to show up
at Moose Lake, their destination, or at their Pear Lake base camp,
Tweed said.
   A helicopter crew found Fonda on top of a mountain early Monday
and reunited her with her friends at the base camp. The group hiked
out together, Tweed said.

   Rocker Bruce Springsteen donated $15,000
to a finacially strapped hospital where a relative was treated last
year.
   The donation by the ``Boss'' amounts to roughly half of the
$30,000 raised by employees at Chope Community Hospital.
   ``His agent called and asked us how much was in the fund and he
matched it,'' Tim McMurdo, the hospital's chief executive officer,
said Tuesday.
   Springsteen asked that his relationship to the former patient not
be disclosed.
   Employees started the fund-raising drive for capital improvements
and equipment in the wake of recent county budget shortfalls.

   Freddie Jackson says he almost didn't
take a chance on a singing career because he had a secure job as a
word processor.
   In 1982, Jackson's friend, songwriter Paul Laurence, suggested he
meet Melba Moore and try for a job as a background singer.
   ``I told him I think I should stay here and be the greatest word
processor in the world,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson went on to sing background for Moore, Lilo Thomas, Angela
Bofill and others on studio cuts and tours. Ms. Moore helped him
secure a contract with Columbia Records, which produced his 1985
debut album ``Rock Me Tonight.''
   The album and single ``Rock Me Tonight,'' both reached No. 1 on
Billboard's black charts. Jackson's follow-up, ``Just Like the First
Time,'' also was No. 1 on black charts with the hit singles, ``I
Don't Want to Lose Your Love,'' ``Look Around'', and ``Tasty Love.''
   His current album, ``Don't Let Love Slip Away,'' has landed the
single ``Crazy For Men'' in the pop Top 20.
   ``I'm going to stop singing when I'm not happy doing it

Ballads live on and on.''

   Country music entertainer Lee Greenwood
will perform five shows for U.S. troops in Panama next week.
   Greenwood's USO tour Monday through June 29 includes performances
at Howard Air Base, Fort Clayton and Fort Espinar, World USO
President Chuck Hagel said Tuesday.
   ``Morale may be at a low point now in Panama since the U.S.
government sent families back to the States and moved the military
troops to the base,'' Greenwood said. ``So, when the USO asked me to
go to Panama and give the military community there a little taste of
home, I didn't hesitate.''
   Greenwood has won seven male vocalist of the year awards, the
Country Music Association's song of the year award for ``God Bless
the U.S.A.'' and a Grammy for best male country performance.

   Adrienne Brown, wife of imprisoned soul
singer James Brown, will spend the next five years on probation as a
result of her guilty plea to a drug charge.
   She also was ordered Tuesday to pay a $5,000 fine and continue
with drug and alcohol screening.
   Mrs. Brown, 39, was arrested in May 1988 as she got off a plane
in Augusta and was charged with possessing the drug PCP. She had
been arrested on a similar charge six weeks earlier. One of two
charges was dropped when she pleaded guilty to the other.
   Brown, 56, is serving a six-year sentence at the State Park
Correctional Center near Columbia, S.C., for trying to run over two
policemen during an auto chase last fall.

   Joe Paterno says his autobiography will
be a lot more than a story about coaching football at Penn State.
   ``It's the story of my life and where I grew up and the things
that have influenced me,'' said the 62-year-old New York City native.
   ``Paterno: By The Book'' includes the coach's upbringing, his
thoughts on ethics in college sports and the Roman poet Virgil's
effect on his life.
   One lesson in the book due out in September: Winning is possible
without breaking the rules.
   ``It tells about some of the problems we've had and how we've
been able to succeed without intentionally breaking any rules,''
said Paterno, who co-authored the book with Penn State associate
English professor Bernard Asbell.
   In 23 years as Penn State's head coach, Paterno has won 212 games
and two national championships. Last year, the Nittany Lions
recorded their first losing season in 50 years.
   ``I'm not the goody-goody some people think,'' Paterno said
Tuesday. ``There are an awful lot of things about me I don't like.''

   A Dallas County grand jury on Tuesday declined to
indict a city bus driver accused of killing a passenger by shooting
him in the back after an argument.
   Chauncey J. Plummer, 37, a Dallas bus driver for 10 years, had
been charged with murder in the May 24 shooting of David Hayden, 25.
   Plummer picked up Hayden and a woman on a downtown street and
told authorities that, through his rearview mirror, he saw the woman
hand her bus pass to Hayden, who then tried to use it.
   The driver told Hayden he could not use the pass, an argument
ensued and Plummer ordered Hayden off the bus, police records show.
Hayden was shot once in the back with a handgun as he exited.
   Plummer told police that Hayden punched him in the jaw before he
stepped off the bus.
   Plummer had been assaulted twice on the bus route in the past two
years, once breaking his hand and the other time suffering a black
eye, Dallas Area Rapid Transit spokesman Ron Whittington said.
   DART authorities, meanwhile, have begun proceedings to dismiss
Plummer for violating company policy, which forbids drivers from
carrying firearms. A decision was expected by Friday.

   A campaign of terror by the South
African-led police threatens free and fair independence elections in
Namibia, the U.N. special representative for Namibia asserts.
   Namibian police in armored cars mounted with heavy machine guns
reportedly drive through villages destroying crops and terrorizing
inhabitants, the official, Martti Ahtisaari, wrote in a letter
obtained Tuesday.
   ``Their activities appear to have created an atmosphere of fear
and intimidation among much of the population in the northern
region,'' he wrote Louis Pienaar, South Africa's
administrator-general in Namibia.
   The letter said a feared counterinsurgency unit called
``Koevoet,'' Afrikaans for crowbar, is behind the terror campaign.
   Ahtisaari sent the letter on June 9. No reply has been received,
U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said Tuesday.
   Ahtisaari is leading a U.N. commission monitoring Pretoria's
cooperation with a U.N.-mediated plan to free Namibia from 74 years
of South African rule.
   November elections for the territory's first black majority-ruled
government are scheduled under the independence plan.
   Northern Namibia is the homeland of the Ovambo tribe, which
supports the South-West Africa People's Organization, known as SWAPO.
   The guerrilla movement, which led a 23-year bush war against
South African rule of Namibia, is expected to win the elections.
Campaigning begins July 1. Many observers believe South Africa is
actively trying to prevent SWAPO from winning a two-thirds majority
in the assembly by funding political parties and using the Koevoet
police to intimidate SWAPO supporters.
   Ahtisaari wrote that: ``the activities in which they (Koevoet)
have been engaged render its members ... unfit for continued service
in the police during the transition period.''
   ``The continuance of the situation ... raises grave doubt in my
mind'' as to whether free and fair elections are possible, he wrote.

<TEXT>
   Hispanics flooded into California, Florida and
Texas and accounted for about one-fourth of the nation's total
population growth in the first half of this decade, the Census
Bureau reports.
   Those states and New York each now have more than 1 million
Hispanics, the bureau said in its first detailed analysis of
minority populations since the 1980 census.
   Sixteen states, led by New York, had more than 1 million blacks
as of 1985, while California had the most Hispanics and other
minorities, the study found.
   Blacks comprise the nation's largest minority at 28.9 million,
the study reported. New York had the largest black population at 2.7
million, followed by California with 2.1 million blacks.
   But the black population of California was growing faster, adding
243,000 between 1980 and 1985, compared to a 219,000 increase for
the Empire State.
   The nation's Hispanic population jumped from 14.3 million in 1980
to 17.5 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth rates
and international migration. Although they were only 6.3 percent of
the U.S. population in 1980, Hispanics made up about one-fourth of
the 12 million national population increase during the next
half-decade, the report said.
   California has the largest Hispanic population, the report
showed, at 5.9 million _ one-third of all Hispanics in the nation.
   Texas was second at 3.7 million followed by New York at 1.9
million and Florida with 1.1 million.
   California added 1.3 million Hispanics between 1980 and 1985,
while Texas gained 700,000. Florida, New York and Illinois also
added more than 100,000 Hispanics each.
   Among states with a million or more blacks the fastest growth
rate for that group, 16 percent, was posted by Florida.
   Mississippi had the largest proportion of blacks in its
population, 36 percent, the report found, followed by South
Carolina, 31 percent, and Louisiana, 30 percent.
   During the first half of this decade only West Virginia and the
District of Columbia had a decline in black population.
   More than four out of five blacks reside in metropolitan areas,
the bureau found. And the shift continued to be in favor of cities
with blacks migrating out of rural southern regions and into urban
areas.
   The report added that four metropolitan areas have more than 1
million black residents _ New York (3.2 million), Chicago (1.6
million), Los Angeles (1.2 million) and Philadelphia (1.1 million).
   Almost 90 percent of all Hispanics live in metropolitan areas,
with more than half in seven metro areas, the study found _ Los
Angeles (3.6 million), New York (2.3 million), Miami (815,000), San
Francisco (775,000), Chicago (757,000), Houston (595,000) and San
Antonio (568,000).
   The nation also included 7.3 million other minorities, a category
that includes Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Eskimos
and Aleuts. This group jumped 1.9 million over five years, largely a
result of international migration.
   With 2.3 million, California was the leader in this category,
followed by Hawaii, 692,000, and New York, 516,000.
   Texas, Virginia and New Jersey had the fastest growing
populations in this group, however. Texas' other races increased 67
percent to 314,600 while the group was up 52 percent to 126,800 in
Virginia and 51 percent to 184,000 in New Jersey.

<HEAD>Democrats Failing to Highlight Family Issues, Consultant Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are failing to capitalize on family
issues such as child care at the polls because they are ``afraid to
take on the tax consequences'' of programs that voters say they
support, a party consultant says.
   But a Republican strategist warned women's groups that even
though child care has emerged as an important campaign issue in
recent years, ``there are a lot of folks who just don't care about
the issue.''
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic expert on electing women candidates,
and Vince Breglio, a former campaign strategist for Senate
Republicans before becoming President Bush's chief pollster for the
1988 campaign, appeared on a panel at a meeting held by child care
advocates Tuesday.
   Panelist Ethel Klein, an associate professor of political science
at Columbia University, said a February poll by Louis Harris &amp;
Associates showed 87 percent approval for a joint government and
private effort to meet child care needs. She said 55 percent of
those responding to a CBS News poll in February said the federal
government had a responsibility to help parents pay for child care
if they couldn't afford it.
   Breglio, however, said the most recent White House polls show
that Bush's child care program, built around a tax credit, has about
5 percent to 6 percent more support than congressional legislation
calling for direct government financing.
   Ms. Lake told the group that family issues ``ought to work very
well for Democrats. They are policy issues where people want
spending and they want it now, not later. They want government
involvement.''
   ``We as Democrats have not drawn strong enough political lines on
this issue,'' the consultant said. ``Democrats have tended to talk
about small cost ... and all this has done is lose the punch of
these issues because we have been afraid to take on the tax
consequences, the regulatory consequences, of these programs, and in
fact voters think these issues are going to take big programs.''
   Breglio said such family issues as child care first surfaced in
political campaigns in 1986.
   ``I had candidates who were beaten on those kinds of issues,'' he
said. ``They were beaten because, with my stupid advice, they talked
about national themes and ideology. Well, national themes and
ideology didn't sell in 1986. Concern over nuclear waste and child
care did. We were wrong, they were right, and we lost many Senate
seats.''
   However, he cautioned the group, ``There are a lot of folks out
there who feel strongly about it, but I must tell you this: there
are a lot of folks who just don't care.''
   Both consultants agreed that family issues will have significant
impact in next year's congressional elections.
   ``I don't believe serious political candidates in 1990 can avoid
discussing the issue of child care,'' Breglio said. ``I don't
believe they can avoid discussing the issue of long-term health
care.'' However, he said he did not believe parental leave would be
an issue.
   Ms. Lake predicted all three would be major issues, particularly
if Congress passes child care and parental leave legislation and
Bush vetoes it on top of his veto of the recent bill raising the
minimum wage.
   Breglio said Bush is ``doing pretty well'' with women voters, but
``If there is a whole series of vetoes on legislation that is of
particular importance to women, that could be a different ballgame.''
   The panel was sponsored by the Child Care Action Campaign, a
coalition seeking a national system of child care combining public
and private resources; the Great American Family Tour, a non-profit,
non-partisan organization dealing with family policy issues, headed
by Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.; and Lifetime Television, a
venture of Hearst@ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services,
which produce a documentary entitled ``Hush Little Baby: The
Challenge of Child Care.''

   The phrase ``doggie do'' has a different
meaning for two sisters who make it their livelihood.
   Diane Fenger and Arlene Steinle train canine coiffeurs to handle
everything from American Kennel Club show styles to the occasional
doggie dye job.
   The words ``dog groomer'' are taboo at their Tara Lara Academy of
K-9 Hair Design because the sisters believe that's like saying the
Cordon Bleu turns out cooks.
   ``We aren't teaching basic dog grooming,'' said Fenger, who
founded the school 20 years ago with her sister. ``We are teaching
all-breed styling, including show work.''
   Fenger, a former hairdresser, traded permanents for pooches in
1968. The academy, highlighted in the sisters' book, ``The Standard
Book of Dog Grooming,'' draws students from around the country. The
school isn't cheap: $795 for a four-week groomer's assistant course,
up to $2,995 for a 16-week master course.
   Students scrub dogs in tubs, cut their hair and dry it with a
blow dryer or a heated cage dryer. The finishing touch includes
ribbons, scarves or bells. Fenger said she also teaches students how
to handle the dogs, including touching the animals in specific
places to control and relax them. She said properly handled dogs are
less likely to bite the hand that grooms them.

   Government handouts have come a long way since the
federal government doled out surplus cheese. In Massachusetts,
they're giving away toilets.
   This summer, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, hoping
to promote an ethic of water conservation, is handing out 2,500
low-flow toilets to communities for public use.
   The Municipal Toilet Replacement Program is designed with the
hope that after residents try the toilets at their town hall or
public library they will buy one for their home, said Jeffrey
Lissack, a spokesman for the program. The toilets cost the authority
$350,000.
   The authority needs to save water to continue adequately
supplying water to 2.5 million people in the Boston area.
   Toilets consume an average of 38 percent of household water.
Conventional toilets use 3.5 gallons to 7 gallons per flush; the
model being given away uses 1.6 gallons or less.
   Starting March 2, the state will require that all new toilets use
no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush, which is expected to
save more than 3 million gallons of water daily.

   Holy Harvey Wallbanger, Batman! A bartender
won your Batmobile.
   Patrick McLynn, who is paying his way through Virginia
Commonwealth University by tending bar part time, has won the
hottest car in Gotham City as part of the nationwide hoopla
surrounding the opening of the movie ``Batman.''
   There's just one problem: The Caped Crusader's vehicle doesn't
have a motor.
   Greg Drebin, a publicist for MTV, which gave away the car,
explained the empty space under the hood.
   ``It simply was not streetworthy,'' Drebin said. ``The car was
the real prop used in the picture. But its motor was too heavy, the
ratio wasn't according to regulations. It has only been driven by
stunt men.''
   Luckily for McLynn, the prize also includes $25,000 for bat-gas.
He said he will invest the money in certificates of deposit and use
the interest to buy a motorcycle.
   McLynn, an engineering student whose goal is to become a toy
designer, will collect his prize Friday at the Ridge Cinema from
``Batman'' co-star Robert Wuhl. He said he's not sure what he will
do with the car.
   ``I think it should be shown at theaters where the movie is
playing and maybe state fairs around the country,'' said McLynn, who
doesn't own a car and gets around on a bicycle or skateboard.
   The Batmobile is 20 feet long and more than 11 feet wide. Its
design is derived from Utah Salt Flats racers of the 1930s and
Corvette Stingrays of the 1950s.
   When fully armed, it has retractable armor, machine guns
concealed above the front wheels, explosive charges in the wheel
hubs, remote voice-activated controls, the latest electronic
tracking devices and a ``high fear-inducing factor,'' according to
Anton Furst, its designer.

   Oliver L. North's sentencing is postponed while
the judge considers defense charges that one of the Iran-Contra
jurors who convicted the former White House aide deliberately lied
during jury selection.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell postponed Friday's
scheduled sentencing after North's lawyers produced evidence that
juror Tara King failed to disclose that a brother had been convicted
of armed robbery and that two others had arrest records.
   The defense also alleged that Ms. King's statements to reporters
after the verdict that she used marijuana and cocaine before the
trial suggests she was under the influence of drugs during the trial.
   Ms. King told interviewers that she did not use drugs during her
jury service.
   The judge on Tuesday postponed sentencing until July 5 and
scheduled a June 28 hearing on defense allegations that Ms. King
intentionally withheld the information when she filled out a
questionnaire given to prospective jurors.
   The questionnaire asked if any member of her family had ever been
a party or witness to a civil or criminal court proceeding or had
been under investigation by law enforcement authorities.
   The 35-year-old office worker answered the question in the
negative.
   ``This apparently intentional misstatement raises serious
questions as to juror bias and impartiality,'' North's lawyers said
in pleadings that were unsealed Tuesday by the judge.
   Gesell might be forced to grant a mistrial if the defense can
prove that it learned after the verdict that Ms. King deliberately
withheld information to get on the jury.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, in other pleadings ordered
unsealed, said North and his lawyers must prove that they learned
about Ms. King's misstatements after the verdict.
   Otherwise, his motion ```constitutes an impermissible attempt to
sandbag the judicial process,''' Walsh said, quoting from a 1982
appellate court decision.
   Gesell gave North's lawyers until Friday to state ``the precise
date and time when counsel first learned each fact.''
   Walsh also argued that Ms. King may have inadvertently answered
the question incorrectly, noting that she is nearly 17 years younger
than the brother convicted of armed robbery in 1987.
   Walsh said it was possible that ``any knowledge she did have
simply did not come to mind at the time she completed the jury
questionnaire,'' particularly since Ms. King has 14 brothers and
sisters.
   During the trial, the defense did not seek to replace two jurors
with alternates following media reports that they had failed to
disclose involvements in lawsuits arising from traffic accidents.
   Walsh also contended there was no evidence that Ms. King was
biased against North.
   ``If King developed any prejudice'' from her brothers' trouble
with law enforcement, ``it would likely be directed against the
prosecution, not defendants,'' Walsh said.
   North, 45, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, faces a possible
10-year sentence.
   The jury convicted North of aiding and abetting the obstruction
of a congressional inquiry into the Iran-Conta affair, destroying or
altering official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity _ the
installation of a security fence outside his home by arms dealer
Richard V. Secord.
   North was acquitted of nine other charges.

   Exxon Corp. and other big oil companies say
they'll spend $250 million over five years to sharpen their ability
to combat massive oil spills, and the Bush administration is
stepping up surveillance of the Alaska oil system.
   The major oil companies, in their first comprehensive step to
improve contingency planning for big spills, said Tuesday they will
create a nationwide network of response teams capable of handling an
accident as large as the Exxon Valdez disaster anywhere on U.S.
coastal waters.
   The plan is voluntary, which environmental groups and some
members of Congress said minimizes its importance and underscores
the need for federal legislation to require better response
capabilities.
   ``When it comes to the protection of our fragile environment,
`good faith' simply is not good enough,'' said Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, D-Conn. He said he will introduce legislation Thursday to
increase oil companies' financial liability for oil spills.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, meanwhile, said the
government will begin a comprehensive safety inspection of the
800-mile Alaska pipeline later this month, two years earlier than
scheduled, as a precautionary measure.
   ``The Exxon Valdez oil spill has taught us a valuable lesson: the
need to avoid complacency when it comes to protecting our
environment,'' Skinner said.
   On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, a Senate committee approved a bill
providing a range of spill-prevention actions, including randam
alcohol testing of oil tanker crews.
   The bill, backed by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, would open
highway driving records of merchant mariners to the Coast Guard,
provide for alcohol testing of people in safety-sensitive jobs on
tankers and improve radar systems to aid in tracking ships through
potentially hazardous areas.
   Richard M. Morrow, chairman of the American Petroleum Institute,
which sponsored development of the industry's new spill-response
plan, said it is not designed to head off legislation to force more
responsibility on the companies.
   ``We want to move forward regardless of what Congress does,'' he
told a news conference.
   The industry plan includes measures aimed at preventing future
disasters and establishing clearer lines of government authority for
reacting to tanker accidents.
   Allen E. Murray, chairman of Mobil Corp. and head of a special
task force that produced the plans after two months of study, said
the industry hopes to have the new system in full operation within a
year.
   Environmental groups generally welcomed the program but said they
want to see it implemented before assessing its long-term importance.
   ``It's a good step,'' said Gaylord Nelson, counsel to the
Wilderness Society, a Washington-based environmental group.
``They're finally recognizing that the country is aroused and
outraged, and they're responding because they have to.''
   A key to success of the new system, Murray said, is giving the
Coast Guard full responsibility for deciding when industry cleanup
crews will be called into action. Current lines of authority between
state and federal agencies are unclear, he said.
   ``Somebody has to be able to be in charge and not have to make a
conference call, and we think that should be the Coast Guard,''
Murray said.
   The Coast Guard said Tuesday it needs time to study the plan
before commenting.
   The plan will cost more than $250 million over the first five
years, adding one-twentieth of 1 cent a year to the oil companies'
cost of making a gallon of gasoline, said Morrow.
   Murray said the added expense will not be tacked onto gas prices
at the pump.
   ``It's a cost of doing business for the industry _ we'll absorb
it,'' he said.
   The plan will:
   _Establish a Petroleum Industry Response Organization
headquartered in Washington D.C. and regional ``response centers''
in New York, Norfolk, Va., New Orleans, Long Beach, Calif., and
Seattle.
   Each center will be staffed around the clock by trained cleanup
specialists and will be equipped to handle a 30,000-ton oil spill _
about the same as the Valdez spill.

   Leo Edwards Jr., a black man whose
conviction by an all-white jury provoked cries of racism by his
attorneys, was put to death in Mississippi's gas chamber early
Wednesday.
   Edwards, 36, convicted of murdering a convenience store clerk
during a 1980 crime spree, lost two appeals just hours before the
execution. He was pronounced dead at 12:15 a.m. at the Mississippi
State Penitentiary here.
   The Supreme Court, by a 7-2 vote, had denied Edwards' request for
a stay Tuesday.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Supreme Court halted the execution of a
Missouri man convicted of killing an elderly couple. Shortly after
that, a federal judge in St. Louis granted a stay of execution for
his accomplice.
   Leonard Laws, 39, and George Gilmore, 42, had been scheduled to
die early Wednesday morning.
   The high court's ruling in the Mississippi case was followed two
hours later by a statement from Gov. Ray Mabus saying he refused to
grant clemency for Edwards.
   ``I have reviewed the facts in the case of Leo Edwards, and I
will not stand in the way of the court's justice,'' the governor
said.
   ``The facts are that Leo Edwards is a mass murderer who killed in
cold blood, he tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the
courts, and discrimination had no bearing on his case.
   ``This is not casual justice. Leo Edwards' sentence is a result
of his own crime, and his fate now rests in God's hands,'' the
governor said.
   Edwards, 36, of New Orleans, was convicted on April 1, 1981 in
the death of Jackson convenience store clerk Linzy Don Dixon during
a robbery. The robbery and killing were committed after Edwards
escaped from a Louisiana prison.
   Edwards and co-defendant Mike White went on a five-day robbery
spree that left three store clerks dead and two wounded in Hinds and
Madison counties.
   White pleaded guilty to murder in Dixon's death and the slaying
of bar owner Lee Ardis Newsome. White got two life terms.
   Edwards was sentenced to life in Newsome's killing.
   Edwards was within less than 14 hours of a trip to the gas
chamber on Oct. 25, 1988, when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped the
scheduled execution.
   Mississippi has executed three men since the Supreme Court
reinstituted the death penalty in 1976. Jimmy Lee Gray was executed
in 1983, and Edward Earl Johnson and Connie Ray Evans went to the
gas chamber in 1987.

<HEAD>Nuts May Help Prevent Heart Attack Deaths, Study Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A handful of nuts a day may keep the heart
attack away, according to a group of California researchers.
   A six-year study of diet and fatal coronary heart disease among
34,000 California members of the Seventh-Day Adventists Church found
that nuts were the only food item listed with a statistically
significant protection against heart attack death.
   ``Compared to a person who never ate nuts, a person who ate them
at least once a day had only 47 percent of the risk'' of fatal heart
attack, said Dr. Gary E. Fraser, co-author of a study presented
Tuesday at the 2nd International Conference of Preventive Cardiology.
   ``Making this even more significant is that a year ago we looked
at non-fatal (heart attacks) and got findings that were extremely
similar,'' said Fraser. ``Nuts seem to reduce the risk of both fatal
and non-fatal heart disease.''
   The researcher cautioned that the study is from only one
population group and ``should be interpreted as an interesting, but
still somewhat preliminary finding'' until other studies are done.
   Fraser said the data was collected through questionnaires mailed
between 1976 and 1982. In a follow-up study, the researchers found
there had been 260 fatal heart attacks among those surveyed earlier.
The scientists then compared answers on the dietary questionnaires
to determine what foods, if any, tended to suggest protection
against heart disease.
   ``Significant protective relationships were seen with consumption
of whole wheat bread, nuts and citrus fruits,'' the report said. But
in a further refinement of the data, Fraser said nuts appeared to be
the major common food that protected against heart disease.
   ``It was fairly consistent across the sexes, by the age groups,
by smokers and nonsmokers, and all of the major risk factors,'' he
said.
   A re-survey of part of the study group determined that peanuts
were the most commonly consumed nut _ chosen by about 60 percent of
those questioned.
   Fraser said the questions dealt only with the frequency of nut
consumption and found that the more often nuts were eaten, the
greater the protection. Those who ate nuts at least once a day did
best.
   As to quantity, Fraser said ``a handful of nuts, or something
like that'' was probably typical.
   Fraser said it is not now known what in nuts can provide
protection from heart attack, but he speculated that it could be the
types of vegetable fats.
   ``They are relatively fatty, as vegetable foods go, but they have
much more polyunsaturated fat than most of the fatty foods one would
eat,'' he said. Other studies have shown that polyunsaturated fats
tend to be less likely to cause coronary disease than saturated
fats, the type that is commonly in meats.
   Co-authors of the Loma Linda University study were Dr. Joan
Sabate and Dr. David Kissinger.

<HEAD>Plan to Revamp Tax Penalties Aims at Willful Non-payers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill endorsed by the House Ways and Means
Committee tries to draw a distinction between careless taxpayers and
those who are out to beat the system.
   Taxpayers also would face less chance of being penalized two or
more times for the same mistake, under the measure passed by a voice
vote Tuesday.
   The bill would revamp the system of nearly 150 civil tax
penalties that may be imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, and
is intended to be part of the committee's share of deficit reduction
for the budget year that begins Oct. 1.
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the committee's oversight
panel and chief author of the overhaul, said public hearings showed
``the current penalty structure is a confusing morass of complex,
overlapping penalties that are often unduly harsh or just plain
irrational.''
   Just 35 years ago, the IRS had only 13 penalties to enforce. The
growth is partly due to Congress' use of penalties to raise revenue,
authorities say.
   In 1988, the IRS assessed 26 million penalties totaling nearly $6
billion.
   The IRS supports overhauling the penalty structure. The rewriting
is based on the notion that penalties should be used only to
encourage compliance, not to raise money.
   An example of the changes: Present law imposes a 5 percent
penalty for underpayment of tax; the bill would raise that generally
to 20 percent.
   Most of the changes involve penalties on banks and other payers
that fail to file reports on interest and dividends paid, and on
employers that miss the deadline for turning over withheld taxes to
the Internal Revenue Service.
   In most cases, the revised penalties would be graduated so that
the longer the delay in paying or filing and the more blatant the
mistake, the higher the penalty.
   For example, the penalty for failing to file an information
return with the IRS _ such as a Form 1099 statement, on which a bank
reports interest paid to a depositor _ now is $50 for each failure
to file. The maximum is $100,000 a year. The bill would vary that
from $15 for a few days' tardiness (a maximum of $75,000 a year) to
$50 per failure, to a maximum of $250,000.

<HEAD>Industrial Countries Boost Consumption; Drop Reported in Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans, Japanese and west Europeans have
been boosting their consumption and investment in the future during
the 1980s but Third World countries have lagged in both, according
to the World Bank.
   The average Japanese, for example, used $5,269 worth of goods in
1980 and $6,206 in 1987. The average for the 12 countries of the
European Economic Community rose from $6,127 to $6,922. In the
United States consumption rose to an average $8,957 from $7,609.
   Investment rose too _ that is, the building of new factories and
machinery that create more production and jobs for the future.
Americans on average invested the least of the three, and much of
the money was borrowed abroad, but there was an average rise from
$1,918 to $2,373. The European rise was smaller, from $2,338 to
$2,432. Japan's increase was greater: from $2,994 to $3,801.
   No figures are given for the Soviet Union. The Central
Intelligence Agency, which publishes some percentages, found Soviet
consumption growing slowly and even declining a bit between 1985 and
1986.
   The World Bank figures appeared in the 1988-1989 edition of its
``World Tables,'' a 650-page volume that consists largely of
statistics. The bank uses the value of the dollar in 1980 as a
measuring stick.
   The figures show that people in some Third World countries,
despite low incomes and mounting debt, generally managed to keep
their consumption fairly steady _ though at levels that reflect deep
poverty compared with industrial countries. The average consumption
in Third World countries rose slightly, from $451 in 1980 to $483 in
1987.
   Behind the averages lie wide variations. The value of goods
consumed by the average Chinese increased by more than half between
1979 and 1987, but in 1987 they were still worth only $217.
   In Nigeria, the most populous country of Africa, there was a
decline from a peak of $821 in 1982 to $621 in 1987. Average incomes
of people in many poor African countries have been going down since
they became independent of European colonial powers during the 1960s
and 1970s. Consumption in those African countries rose between 1980
and 1987, but only to an average $206 a year from $174.
   There also were declines in Latin America, though not as great on
average as in Africa.
   An ominous figure was one for low-income Africans, where
investment declined from an average of only $67 in 1974 to $38 in
1987. That means fewer schools, roads, clinics, factories and other
installations are being built that could improve living standards
and incomes for the next generation.

<HEAD>Once Shy, Haitian Student Becomes Presidential Scholar in the Arts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Sandra Dupiton arrived from Haiti five
years ago, she was painfully shy but determined to become a dancer.
This week, she was good enough to perform at the Kennedy Center and
receive a medallion from President Bush at the White House.
   ``I always knew I could dance,'' she says. ``I always believed in
myself that I could do it.''
   Now 18 and shy no longer, Sandra was selected by a White House
commission as one of America's 20 most promising young artists. She
and 140 other high school seniors across the country traveled to
Washington as this year's Presidential Scholars for their academic
and artistic excellence.
   Sandra, who lives with her mother in Brooklyn, N.Y., will be
graduated next Tuesday from Julia Richman High School in Manhattan,
where she took her first dance lessons four years ago in the
school's Talent Unlimited arts program. She will enter Sarah
Lawrence College on a scholarship this fall.
   Greeting the Presidential Scholars on the White House South Lawn,
the president said Tuesday they were ``some of the best and
brightest students in American education,'' and had an obligation to
help others.
   ``While already you've done much, I know you will do more _ and
not for yourselves alone, but for nation and neighbors,'' Bush said.
   ``The definition of a successful life must include serving
others. That goes double for America's best,'' he told them.
   Sandra and her 19 fellow Presidential Scholars in the Arts were
chosen from among 5,200 applicants whose achievements were judged by
the non-profit National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts at
Miami. Finalists were recommended to the White House commission for
final selections.
   The 20 top young artists displayed their talents Monday night on
the stage of the Kennedy Center Concert Hall, one of five days of
activities ending today. Sandra, who specializes in modern dance,
performed a solo she choreographed with her high school teacher,
Paul Thompson.
   In a backstage interview before the show, Thompson said that as a
freshman in his dance class, ``Sandra was so shy she couldn't even
speak her name'' and would turn away and hide her face.
   ``But when she danced her first solo, I saw that she had some
special spirit, this fire, this spark,'' he said. ``I knew it would
come out, so I didn't push her. Although she was very, very shy, she
had this incredible desire to learn and excell.''
   Sandra said dance lessons were too expensive in Haiti, so at age
13 she moved to Brooklyn to live with an aunt and study in New York.
She didn't know a word of English. ``I was feeling like an
outcast,'' she said, blaming her shyness on fear of being ostracized
because of her Creole accent.
   But a few months after she began studying with Thompson, she
said, her fear abruptly vanished in her physical exuberance on the
dance floor.
   ``I suddenly burst out,'' she said. ``My body just let go, and he
told me it was good. Dancing really helped me to open up, and it
became easier to use that freedom to speak.''
   At 15, she won favorable notice in The New York Times for a dance
recital by her high school troupe at a Manhattan theater. She won
scholarships to study at the Joffrey Ballet and the Martha Graham
School of Contemporary Dance. This summer, she studied on
scholarship with the Dance Theater of Harlem.
   Sandra has pursued her dream without apparent support from her
mother, who moved to Brooklyn from Haiti with Sandra's brother and
sister in 1986.
   ``My family has never seen me dance,'' she said. ``My mother
doesn't like it because she says you can't earn a good living at
dancing.''
   But Thompson is convinced that Sandra will prevail because of her
natural talent. ``Her growth in the last four years has been
phenomenal,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Group Touts Airline Survey, Tobacco Institute Objects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An anti-smoking group says its survey of 27,000
airline passengers proves the public supports a smoking ban on short
flights, but the tobacco industry says the survey is unscientific.
   The American Association of Respiratory Care says 51.7 percent of
smokers agree that the current smoking ban on flights of two hours
or less should be made permanent. The support among non-smokers is
91.1 percent, the group said Tuesday.
   The association announced the results of its survey, conducted by
volunteers at 66 airports in 33 cities during the last week of
April, at a news conference Tuesday with several House members who
support anti-smoking legislation.
   The airline smoking law will remain in effect until April 1990
unless Congress makes it permanent.
   Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said the association's survey, which
shows 84 percent overall approval of the anti-smoking law, is solid
evidence of the law's support and effectiveness.
   ``Even most smokers realize this law has helped improve the
health and safety of everyone who flies,'' said Durbin.
   But the Tobacco Institute, in a news release, said the poll was
inconsistent with other data on the issue. It accused the
respiratory care association of conducting unscientific polls that
generate ``self-serving, questionable data.''
   The institute said professional polls taken when airlines were
required to have smoking and nonsmoking areas on all flights showed
87 percent support for that policy.
   The respiratory association gave no margin of error for its poll,
but said it took steps to ensure that poll-takers did not identify
themselves as being from an anti-smoking group.
   It said support for the smoking ban has risen 30 percent since
the organization conducted a similar poll in 1987.
   Durbin said his anti-smoking measure would be attached to the
transportation appropriation bill and include two amendments. One
would impose a smoking ban on all U.S. flights. If it fails, the
other would make the two-hour-flight ban permanent.
   A House aviation subcommittee plans a hearing Thursday on
Durbin's measure and three other bills that would take various steps
against smoking on airliners.

   Taxpayers nationwide will foot the bill if a
New York utility is granted deductions for its losses on the
Shoreham nuclear power plant, a Pennsylvania congressman contends.
   ``Taxpayers from Alaska to Florida will suffer because the
plant's owner has been granted a $2.8 billion tax break,'' Rep. Don
Ritter, R-Pa., said Tuesday in denouncing plans to close the Long
Island reactor.
   Ritter is pushing legislation to block the estimated $2.8 billion
writeoff for the Long Island Lighting Co.
   The Internal Revenue Service in April approved the tax deduction
for losses sustained as a result of scrapping the plant.
   Ritter's measure would change the tax code to bar deductions for
losses on the abandonment of a fully licensed nuclear plant. The
bill was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, where
senior New York Democratic Reps. Charles Rangel and Thomas Downey
could be expected to block it.
   Brad Johnson, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's Washington lobbyist,
said Tuesday he takes the challenge seriously but does not think the
bill has much chance of passing.
   ``It would be analogous to a New Yorker introducing legislation
to reopen a plant in California after ratepayers had voted to close
it,'' Johnson added. ``This would be a gross misuse of congressional
power.''
   Under a plan negotiated by Cuomo and LILCO, Shoreham would be
sold to New York state for a symbolic dollar in exchange for a
series of rate hikes. Shoreham's license would be transferred to the
Long Island Power Authority, which would contract with the New York
Power Authority to decommission the $5.5 billion plant.

<TEXT>
   A narrow subcommittee vote to accept Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's $69 billion military purchasing budget shows
Congress is mindful of budget constraints, says House Armed Services
Committee Chairman Les Aspin.
   ``Would you have thought that you could have gotten the
procurement subcommittee to vote for this?'' a gleeful Aspin,
D-Wis., said Tuesday after the procurement and military nuclear
systems subcommittee approved his amendment by a vote of 10-9.
   Aspin, who chairs both the subcommittee and the full Armed
Services panel, had urged his colleagues to accept Cheney's
procurement budget as is, to prevent add-ons totaling $7.2 billion.
   ``I think it's a remarkable testimony to the fact that people do
realize the budget squeeze issue,'' said Aspin.
   The full House Armed Services Committees will vote on the
amendment next week. Aspin declined to give odds on the decision but
indicated that the final vote will be close.
   ``While the budget may not be perfect, it's a darn good product _
especially given the 39 days Dick Cheney had to put it together,''
Aspin told the panel.
   The chairman and two other Democrats _ Ike Skelton of Missouri
and Richard Ray of Georgia _ joined seven of the panel's eight
Republicans in approving the measure.
   Rep. Robert W. Davis of Ohio was the lone GOP member to vote
against the plan, which basically removes the right of members to
rewrite the $300 billion fiscal 1990 budget to restore local
projects canceled by Cheney.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said he was pleased with the vote.
   But some Democratic members complained that the measure amounted
to an abdication of the subcommittee's authority.
   ``A yes vote ... would be abrogating ourselves out of business,''
said Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind.
   ``I think I'm giving up my rights if I have to vote for something
that I can only change on the floor,'' added Rep. Norman Sisisky,
D-Va.
   Some members have pressed for restoring the Navy F-14D Tomcat
fighter and Marine V-22 Osprey, which Cheney canceled. If restored,
the F-14D would add $366 million and the V-22 $700 million.
   Other possible add-ons include $55 million in new equipment for
the Navy P-3 anti-submarine aircraft, $436 million for Air Force
C-130s and $240 million for heavy trucks made in Oshkosh, Wis.
   Aspin said after the vote that lobbying was fierce on both sides,
with President Bush and the Northrop Corp. pushing for adoption of
the Cheney budget. Northrop, which manufactures the B-2 stealth
bomber, fears losing funds for its program to support other military
projects.
   Lobbying against the plan were Grumman Corp., builder of the
F-14, and the alumni association of the Marine Corps, backers of the
V-22 Osprey.

<TEXT>
   Former Speaker Jim Wright has yet to resign
from the House but already is toying with the idea of a comeback,
saying he would consider accepting ``an absolutely genuine draft of
a bipartisan nature.''
   ``I am not sure that I should consider it even then, but I do
very earnestly appreciate it,'' the Texas Democrat said Tuesday in a
statement.
   Wright, who stepped down as speaker amid an ethics investigation,
has said he will resign from the House this month but has not said
precisely when. He was replaced as speaker on May 31 by Rep. Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Over the weekend, Wright reportedly met in his hometown of Fort
Worth with supporters who urged him to run for reelection to the
seat in a move to gain political vindication.
   ``Naturally, I am touched by the warm and gracious spirit of the
request, coming as it apparently does from a variety of different
sources,'' Wright said. ``I have not encouraged it. The only way
that I could even consider it at all would be if it were an
absolutely genuine draft of a bipartisan nature.''
   It is impossible to forecast what the ethics committee might do
if Wright resigned and then won reelection to the House, panel
attorney Mark Davis said Tuesday night.
   Wright was investigated over alleged improprieties in a book deal
and other matters touching on his personal finances. The ethics
panel would be free to reopen the probe that drove Wright from the
speaker's chair.
   Meanwhile, Texas Republican Chairman Fred Meyer said there was no
way that Wright could gain bipartisan support for re-election. ``In
my opinion, Jim Wright said that he was going to resign and the
people who elected him ... expect him to do that'' and not run
again, Meyer said.
   Various Texas politicians have been eyeing Wright's seat. But he
is believed to remain highly popular in his district, where some
voters appear to believe he was treated too harshly, and potential
candidates have been reluctant to surface until he is out of the
picture.
   Foley said Tuesday he thought Wright would be reelected if the
former speaker ran again.
   ``And I think that would demonstrate the strong support that
continues to exist in his congressional district, and I think the
(former) speaker is very proud of that and has a right to be
proud,'' Foley said.
   ``It's never bad for the party to have constituents expressing
support,'' he added.
   Another Texas Democrat, Rep. Charles Stenholm, said that ``the
reality is that the (former) speaker resigned from the speakership
(and) has announced that he intends to resign from the Congress of
the United States.''
   He added: ``That's what the speaker has stated in a very
emotional way to the House and to all of us who have had the
privilege of serving with him. Now to find this new scenario is
quite a shock but it is very constitutionally possible that this
could play.''

   President Bush rattles off his address as
``Pennsylvania Avenue, 1600,'' but don't count on finding him there
if you visit the nation's capital this summer.
   From Memorial Day to Labor Day, Bush will have spent more days
away from the White House than in it.
   If Bush were required to report to Congress on what he did over
the summer, it would fill a substantial volume.
   Between lengthy trips to Europe, Bush has been bounding about the
country, giving a string of often disjointed speeches and conducting
the nation's business on the road.
   Some critics have questioned whether Bush, in his multitudinous
travels, has been logging useful mileage or merely spinning the
adminstration's wheels.
   In the three weeks since he returned from a four-nation, weeklong
trip to Europe centered on a NATO meeting in Brussels, Bush:
   _Made a 4,000-mile, 30-hour round trip to Yellowstone National
Park, Wyoming's Grand Tetons, and Lincoln, Neb., nominally to tout
his environmental programs. However, Bush's late-day visit to
Yellowstone consisted of a tour of an area damaged by last year's
forest fires, and was unrelated to the chief topic of the day _ the
White House's new clean-air legislation.
   _Visited a federal law enforcement training center at Glynco,
Ga., to talk about his anti-crime package. The speech spotlighted a
plan whose details had been announced several weeks before.
   _Flew by helicopter to the Philadelphia suburbs, where he gave a
high school graduation speech and shook hands with all 331 graduates.
   In addition, Bush planned to travel today to Richmond, Va., where
he was to speak at a motor coach exhibit at the Virginia State
Fairgrounds and attend a Republican fund-raiser.
   On Thursday, he travels to New York, both for a fund-raiser and
to unveil details of a youth service program.
   He caps next week with a visit to his family home in
Kennebunkport for a five-day Fourth of July holiday, then goes to
Europe for the seven-nation economic summit and side visits to
Poland, Hungary and the Netherlands.
   In August, he plans a 2{-week vacation in Kennebunkport. And he's
been spending most weeekends not otherwise accounted for at the
presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.
   Bush has been doing some business as he moves around the country.
   He vetoed the minium wage bill aboard Air Force One as he
traveled from Montana to Nebraska last week; in Georgia, he signed a
routine message formally transmitting his crime package to Congress.
   ``Usually, this would entail nothing more than a quick flourish
of the pen and then sending an aide on a 10-minute car ride up from
Pennsylvania Avenue, 1600, on up to Capitol Hill,'' he told his
law-enforcement audience.
   ``But when it comes to fighting crime, you deserve more than just
business as usual.''
   However, even in talking about crime _ a favored subject _ Bush
seemed to be sending a mixed message.
   After a tough speech in which Bush declared, ``let's put the
handcuffs on the criminals, not on the criminal justice system,'' he
was asked by a Border Patrol rookie for ``some words of wisdom when
we enter the field.''
   Bush: ``You'll find that you and your colleagues will be severely
impacted by the battle against narcotics. Word of wisdom would be:
an individual should be treated with respect and given his rights,
or her rights, even though the evidence looks overwhelming. ... I
think we have to be tolerant.''
   The press contingent following Bush as he hops from city to city
has grown increasingly more sparse.
   For the trip to Philadelphia, the White House canceled travel
arrangements for the regular White House press corps, beyond taking
a small ``pool.'' It cited lack of interest among news organizations.
   ``I'm not going to be a policeman or try to guide your coverage
habits. It's as simple as that,'' fumed presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Plan Would Wreck Crime-Fighting Team, Former Leaders Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's plan to
place the nation's elite corps of organized crime-fighting
prosecutors under control of U.S. attorneys is coming under fire
from former leaders of the unit.
   ``It's impractical, it just won't work,'' Philadelphia attorney
Peter F. Vaira said Tuesday at a hearing of the House subcommittee
on criminal justice.
   Under Thornburgh's plan, prosecutors who are members of the
20-year-old Organized Crime Strike Force would no longer report to
the Justice Department's criminal division. Instead, they would be
controlled by the politically appointed U.S. attorneys in the cities
were they are based.
   Thornburgh says the idea would end turf battles between the
strike force and the U.S. attorneys. His critics say the elite
force, which has chalked up impressive victories in the war against
the mob, would soon vanish.
   ``I guarantee you three years from now it will take the FBI to
find the strike forces,'' said Vaira, a former strike force chief in
Chicago and Phildelphia who also was U.S. attorney in Philadelphia
and briefly headed the President's Commission on Organized Crime.
   Edward A. McDonald, former head of the strike force in Brooklyn,
was sharply critical of what Thornburgh and his aides ``call
euphemistically the merger of the strike force. I like to call it
the destruction or the abolition of the strike force.''
   The plan already has sent strike force attorneys in New York
hunting for new jobs, he said, adding that the departure of highly
experienced prosecutors is likely to grow worse.
   Lawmakers are considering a move to bar Thornburgh from
implementing the plan until Oct. 1 as part of a stopgap spending
bill likely to go to President Bush and gain his signature. But the
move could go forward after that.
   Former New England strike force chief Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan
testified that strike force attorneys often are paid $7,000 to
$10,000 less than U.S. attorneys, even though they usually have more
experience.
   Because of salary adjustments, Thornburgh's plan would cost
$100,000 in each city where the strike force is located, O'Sullivan
testified.
   ``You'd be looking at an increase of $1 million right off the
bat'' nationwide, he said.
   ``After all these victories, I think it is fair to ask: What is
broke that needs fixing?'' said subcommittee Chairman Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. He said, however, that he would keep an open mind on
the issue.
   Edward S.G. Dennis, head of the criminal division of the Justice
Department, told the panel that Thornburgh's ``concern for the fight
against organized crime is second to none.''
   Thornburgh ``feels strongly enough about this proposal that he is
willing to take the heat and the controversy that this proposal
stimulates,'' Dennis said. He said the idea of merging the strike
forces in each city with the U.S. attorney's office was one that
would promote ``even more harmony'' between the two groups of
prosecutors and end ``turf fights.''
   Dennis took issue with claims that the plan would mean the end of
the strike force, saying its members would not be reassigned to work
on cases not involving organized crime.
   He said turf fighting between strike force attorneys and the U.S.
attorneys offices has at times cut into time that should be spent on
fighting mobsters.
   ``The question is, are we going to spend 30 percent of our time
arguing whose case this is, or are we going to make the case?''
Dennis said.

<HEAD>Tampon-Labeling Proposal too Confusing, Says Consumer Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government proposal aimed at helping women
minimize the risk of toxic shock syndrome is too confusing, a
consumer group says, because it would allow tampon boxes to show two
types of absorbency ratings.
   The Food and Drug Administration's revised plan would require
manufacturers to display one of six new standardized absorbency
rating terms ranging from low to high. However, they also could
continue using traditional designations like regular and super.
   ``This whole range system isn't as informative and clear as it
could be,'' said Patti Goldman of the Public Citizen Health Research
Group.
   The proposal is an improvement over FDA's earlier plan to use an
absorbency scale of letters from A to F, ``but there's still
potential for confusion to have the old terms appear nearby,'' she
said.
   The FDA said Tuesday it revised its earlier proposal in response
to about 275 comments from consumers, consumer groups and
manufacturers, many of whom complained that it was too confusing.
   The labeling is designed to help women select the lowest
absorbency tampon they need to reduce the risk of toxic shock
syndrome, which has been associated with tampon use. Toxic shock
syndrome is rare, but sometimes fatal.
   Under the new plan, tampon absorbency would be rated as low,
medium, medium-high, high, very high and highest _ according to the
number of grams the tampon was designed to absorb.
   Tampon boxes also would have to carry labels advising women to
select the lowest absorbency needed to minimize risk of toxic shock
syndrome. Regulations have required this warning since 1982 but
allow it to appear on a package insert.
   Package inserts also must list toxic shock syndrome's symptoms:
sudden fever, vomiting, diarrhea, fainting or nearly fainting when
standing up, dizziness and a sunburn-like rash.
   The FDA has been trying since 1981 to convince manufacturers to
voluntarily label their products with a standardized absorbency
rating so women could compare brand-to-brand. The agency gave up
that route in 1984 and began regulatory efforts.
   The FDA invited public comments on the new proposal until Aug. 11.

<HEAD>Utility Boosted Security to Stem Potential Nuclear Sabotage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities took extra precautions against
potential sabotage by workers at the Rancho Seco nuclear power
station near Sacramento, Calif., after city residents voted to close
the troubled plant, officials disclosed.
   The only incident since the June 6 vote was resolved safely, but
federal regulators said Tuesday they're keeping a close eye on plant
conditions as the Sacramento Municipal Utility District gradually
switches off the reactor with a shrinking work force.
   ``It's not what you'd call an unsafe situation,'' but the unusual
circumstances of the plant shutdown have prompted extra caution,
said Thomas Murley, director of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
office of reactor regulation.
   The vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an
operating reactor, but analysts say it seems unlikely the move will
trigger other closures soon. Still, the shutdown is a blow to an
industry already hampered by widespread public concerns about the
safety and reliability of nuclear power.
   Rancho Seco has a spotty record, producing less than 40 percent
of the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing
year-round operation _ far below the industry average. The utility
district had to double its rates over the past four years to pay for
plant improvements that cost more than the reactor itself.
   Murley said plant executives gave him explicit assurances that
the shutdown would go smoothly, and he said that so far there was no
evidence to the contrary.
   ``It's a very tough period because all the good people will be
looking for other jobs,'' Murley said, adding that there also was a
danger of ``bad reactions'' by plant workers to being forced out of
the 15-year-old nuclear station.
   The utility district's senior nuclear executive, Joseph Firlit,
has resigned, and about 1,000 regular plant workers were expected to
leave by month's end.
   The NRC, which is responsible for ensuring safety at the nation's
110 nuclear reactors, boosted its usual complement of three resident
inspectors at Rancho Seco by three or four for several days before
and after the election, Greg Cook, a spokesman at the commision's
regional office in Walnut Creek, Calif., said Tuesday.
   Cook said extra security inspectors also were sent to the site to
provide around-the-clock surveillance. The NRC has returned to
normal levels of supervision at the plant, he said.
   The utility increased its security at the site but has since
trimmed it back, said spokesman Bert Heffner. He said he was not
sure of all the reasons for the added protection but that a rush of
news reporters to the plant was one.
   Edward Smeloff, a member of the utility district's board, said in
an interview that utility security personnel were added as a general
precaution against possible worker backlash and because of a a
specific incident with one disgruntled employee.
   An offduty reactor operator, angered at the prospect of losing
his job, telephoned the plant the day after the election to say ``he
would not shut it down if so ordered,'' said Smeloff.
   Heffner said the incident did not constitute a threat to
security, but the worker's access to the plant was suspended. He
said no decision has been made on possible disciplinary action
against the man, whose name was not disclosed.
   Dean Kunihiro, an official at the NRC's Walnut Creek office, said
that while ``it's kind of business as usual'' again at Rancho Seco,
the commission is still watchful because a serious accident
involving radioactive release is still possible even though the
reactor is no longer sustaining a chain reaction.
   The plant owner is planning to remove the fuel rods from the
reactor vessel in August but has not yet decided whether it will
continue with the lengthy process of dismantling the plant or try to
sell it to another potential operator.

   A Chinese government-sponsored art show was
launched for year-long showings in the United States on schedule and
without incident _ but also without official Chinese representation.
   Wang Yani, a 14-year-old prodigy who has made 10,000
brush-and-ink paintings since she was 3 years old, was the
undisputed star at the preview of her exhibition of 69 colorful
pictures.
   In a demonstration lasting barely an hour, she created a 70th
painting, dashing barefoot, brush in hand, from end to end of a 3-by
6-foot parchment laid on a floor.
   Her works show monkeys, birds and other beasts displaying human
emotions and expressions while cavorting through exquisitely drawn
foliage and mountains of Yani's rugged native Guangxi province, in
South China, far from the turmoil of Beijing and Shanghai.
   China's Ministry of Culture is listed as sponsor of the
exhibition but no one from the Chinese Embassy appeared at Tuesday's
event, ``maybe because they were too busy,'' said Milo Beach,
director of the Smithsonian Insitution's Sackler Gallery for Asian
art.
   At the very hour of the preview, Congress members critical of
China's violent crackdown against the pro-democracy movement rallied
at the nearby U.S. Capitol grounds, then went to the Chinese Embassy
to protest killings, violence and arrests in what they described as
a confrontational meeting with Ambassador Han Xu.
   The day after demonstrators were shot down in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences suspended official
scientific exchanges with the Chinese Academy in protest. But no
moves have been reported to suspend cultural exchanges.
   Wang Yani's works have been shown in Japan and Europe and the
U.S. exhibition was first proposed four years ago, said Marc Wilson,
director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Mo., which took
the lead in organizing it. It is scheduled to move there Dec. 16 and
on to San Francisco's Asian Art Museum next March.
   Pictures for the exhibit were sent here months ago and there was
no thought of changing plans, only hope that Yani would appear,
Sackler officials said. She flew here with her father via Beijing
last weekend and plans to return next week, said Susan Bliss,
spokeswoman for the U.S. government-supported gallery. ``We see this
is a cultural event, and apparently not a problem,'' she said.
   The exhibition's official catalog, however, treats Yani as a
symbol of the liberalization in China that is now under threat. It
says the Cultural Revolution during the last decade of Mao Zedong's
rule ``ruthlessly suppressed many of China's greatest artists and
artistic traditions in the name of revolutionary culture.''
   ``Public recognition and appreciation of Wang Yani's remarkable
talent may only have been possible because of the gradual loosening
of government controls over art that followed Mao's death,'' it
adds. ``The paintings of a child who knew nothing of politics
offered a fresh vision that many artists sought in their own work.''
   This is reflected in the title of the exhibition, ``Yani: the
Brush of Innocence.''

<HEAD>DC-Virgin Islands Project Violated City Law, Draft Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A District of Columbia government office
violated city purchasing laws in a joint personnel project with the
Virgin Islands government, according to a draft report on a probe
into the project.
   The Washington Post reported today the preliminary report showed
that the Office of Personnel project cost the city at least
$258,645, or nearly twice as much as the $144,786 in reimbursement
now being sought by the city.
   ``It appears to the committee that this project was a rogue
operation that operated outside the normal lines of authority and
outside the safeguards'' for the expenditure of public funds, said
the draft report on the District Council's investigation.
   A federal grand jury is investigating the project in which the
district helped revamp the island government's personnel system and
draft new laws.
   Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander A. Farrelly and District Mayor
Marion Barry conceived the project which was jointly supervised by
former district Personnel Director Theodore E. Thornton Sr. and
Charles Lewis, a former aide to Farrelly. Lewis later was convicted
on drug charges in the Virgin Islands.
   Inspector James Richard of the U.S. Interior Deparment has said
some D.C. officials used the project as an excuse to party in St.
Thomas at public expense.
   The draft report said Thornton failed to get a written agreement
from the Virgin Islands government covering the project's
activities, and that costs were allowed to escalate despite
indications of ``serious administrative and financial problems.''
   The report cited testimony by Oscar Mays, chief of budget and
financial management for the Office of Personnel, that he was
ordered by a superior to ignore purchasing requirements in hiring
two consultants.

   The battle over President Bush's choice of
Donald P. Gregg as ambassador to South Korea moves to the full
Senate after a favorable committee vote reflecting sharp
disagreement on whether he lied about playing a role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Gregg has repeatedly denied under oath that he was involved in
Oliver North's secret operation to resupply the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels while serving as national security adviser to then-Vice
President George Bush.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who spearheaded the lengthy probe
by the Foreign Relations Committee's Democratic majority into
Gregg's alleged links to the operation, said he had not decided how
hard to press the matter on the Senate floor.
   But Gregg's nomination appeared to have been given a solid boost
by the decision of three committee Democrats to join nine
Republicans in recommending approval. The committee voted 12-7 on
Tuesday to send the nomination to the Senate floor.
   The Senate is not likely to act before it returns from its
Independence Day recess on July 10.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who at one point organized a GOP
boycott of a panel meeting in order to force action on Gregg's
nomination, called the panel's decision ``a very big victory,''
particularly because of Cranston's ``very large expenditure of
energy and political capital.''
   ``Picking up three Democrats is very helpful'' in assuring
Gregg's eventual confirmation,'' McConnell said.
   Earlier McConnell told the committee: ``The president of the
United States is loyal, but he is not foolish. If he had determined
that Gregg was not truthful he would not have submitted this
nomination.''
   Democrats voting to recommend confirmation of Gregg were Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. and Sens. Charles Robb of Virginia and Terry
Sanford of North Carolina.
   In explaining his vote, Pell said he ``concluded that Mr. Gregg
and the president should be given the benefit of the doubt'' despite
the ``excellent arguments'' made by Cranston.
   Robb said he closely examined the evidence and found Gregg's
explanations to be ``as reasonable and believable as I think we
could expect under the circumstances.''
   Gregg is a retired career veteran of the Central Intelligence
Committee who served as CIA station chief in Seoul. Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., said he voted against the nomination not because he believed
Gregg lacked credibility but because he is concerned that his CIA
background will make him a political target in South Korea.
   Addressing the committee moments before the vote, Cranston said
the nomination should be rejected ``on the grounds of both
credibility and judgment.''
   ``We are being asked to reward a man many of us do not believe
has been straight with us while under oath,'' Cranston said. ``We
are being asked to promote a man to a crucial diplomatic post whose
judgment _ by his own admission _ has been so flawed that he twice
offered to resign from then-Vice President Bush's staff.''
   Cranston denied he was making a purely partisan effort to harm
Bush as McConnell and some other Republicans have charged.
   He said he remains highly skeptical that Gregg was never told by
his close friend and former CIA colleague Felix Rodriguez that
Rodriguez was recruited by North to help resupply the Contras with
military aid at a time when Congress had forbidden such activities.
   During two separate appearances before the committee, both times
under oath, Gregg said he was unaware that Rodriguez was doing
anything more than helping the government of El Salvador put down
the left-wing insurgency against it, the mission for which he was
sent to Central America.
   Cranston made clear he does not believe Gregg's story that
although Rodriguez told him some of the details of the Contra
resupply mission in August 1986, he did not put the pieces together
until the following December.
   ``Our hearings revealed documents making clear that Rodriguez and
North were working together in an illegal Contra resupply scheme
months earlier, from January 1985 _ the same week Gregg introduced
Rodriguez to Bush,'' Cranston said.
   ``I recognize how difficult it is for some senators to state the
conclusion most of us share: Mr. Gregg has not been straight with
us,'' Cranston said. ``The implications for Mr. Gregg _ and for the
president _ are not pleasant.''
   The panel also postponed action on three other nominations after
Democrats complained that the nominees' only visible qualifications
were large GOP contributions.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., initiated the delay when he complained
that U.S. ambassadors should have at least some qualifications.
   The three include:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Joseph Zappala, a Florida land developer and national
co-chairman of Bush's fund raising committee who has been nominated
to be U.S. ambassador to Spain. Sarbanes said he contributed
$126,000 to the Bush campaign.
   _Marvin Sembler, a Florida shopping center tycoon who has been
named to be ambassador to Australia. Sarbanes said Sembler was a
$127,000 Bush contributor.
   _Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., residential real estate broker
who has been nominated to be ambassador to New Zealand. She is a
long-time personal friend of Bush and was chairman of the Washington
State Bush For President Committee. Sarbanes said she had no
apparent qualifications except her personal and political ties.
   The panel, and the full Senate, did approve the nomination of C.
Howard Wilkins Jr., a $115,000 contributor to the Bush campaign, to
be ambassador to the Netherlands.
   The panel also confirmed a list of other nominees, including:

Asian and Pacific Affairs.

   An irate William Hurt refused to answer questions
after the actor accused his former lover's lawyer of insulting him
and his 6-year-old son during a courtroom shouting match.
   After the exchange, Sandra Jennings testified that the
39-year-old Oscar-winning actor introduced her to several people as
his wife; Hurt testified Monday and Tuesday that he never did so.
   Ms. Jennings, trying to prove that their three-year relationship
constituted a common-law marriage, is suing for half of what Hurt
earned during the time they lived together.
   The trial was scheduled to resume this afternoon.
   The confrontation Tuesday arose while plaintiff attorney A.
Richard Golub questioned Hurt about his relationship with Jennings,
the mother of the actor's son, Alexander.
   Golub, exasperated by Hurt's answers and by frequent objections
by defense lawyer Martin Shelton, complained to state Justice
Jacqueline Silbermann that Shelton was ``interrupting my rhythm, and
rhythm is everything.''
   As Golub tried to resume questioning after a spate of Shelton's
objections, Hurt _ who had been combative and evasive in 1{ days of
testimony, quipped to the lawyer, ``Get your rhythm right.''
   Golub replied: ``You had yours right, pal, when you had Alex,
didn't you?''
   Hurt asked the judge, ``You can permit that?''
   The judge, hearing the case without a jury, said, ``Objection
sustained!'' and told Golub to stick to the issues. Golub tried to
resume questioning.
   ``I'm blocked,'' Hurt told the lawyer. ``What you just said is an
insult to me, you understand? OK? I can't hear anything else!''
   The judge ordered a 10-minute recess.
   Jennings, a 32-year-old former ballerina, testified that Hurt
introduced her as his wife to people they met in Beaufort, S.C.,
where he was shooting ``The Big Chill'' in late 1982. She
specifically mentioned a real estate agent, Ruben Scheidt, who was
helping them find a place to live.
   ``He introduced me as his wife to a few people,'' she said. ``He
called me his wife on the phone but I don't know to whom.''
   Jennings also said that Hurt discussed marrying her in a double
wedding with ``Big Chill'' co-star Meg Tilly and her fiancee, Tim
Zimmerman. She said the idea was Hurt's.
   Jennings testified that Hurt wanted to get married after they
signed a prenuptial agreement.
   Later, in an interview with New York Post columnist Cindy Adams,
Jennings accused Hurt of committing perjury.
   ``He lied. In court, on the stand, under oath, the man lied,''
she said. ``He said he did not sign a prenuptial agreement with me.
He did. We both did.''
   Hurt, who in March married Heidi Henderson, daughter of
bandleader Skitch Henderson, testified Monday that he failed to get
Jennings to agree in writing that she would never make any claims on
his money.
   Jennings said she refused to sign a later agreement because Hurt
had refused to set up a trust fund for their son.
   Jennings said that under South Carolina statutes, a common-law
marriage exists between them. She based her claim on the period
between Dec. 9, 1982, when Hurt learned his divorce from actress
Mary Beth Hurt was final after seven years of marriage, and Jan. 10,
1983, when they left the state.
   Hurt, who also starred in ``Body Heat,'' ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman,'' ``Broadcast News,'' ``Gorky Park,'' and ``The Accidental
Tourist,'' stayed in court during Jennings' testimony but avoided
looking at her most of the time.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Triggerman in Mexican Journalist's Murder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal police have arrested a former national
security agent and onetime movie actor on suspicion he was the
triggerman in the 1984 murder of leading newspaper columnist Manuel
Buendia, authorities said.
   The Mexico City Attorney General's Office identified the suspect
as Juan Rafael Mora Avila, 36, a member of a prominent family of
politicians from the neighboring state of Puebla.
   Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, former director of a now-dissolved
equivalent of the FBI, was arrested June 13 in Mexico City for
allegedly masterminding the murder and is awaiting trial on charges
of homicide.
   Buendia, whose front-page column in the newspaper Excelsior
exposed wrongdoing in high places, was shot to death on May 30,
1984, at the entrance of a parking garage after leaving his office.
   The Attorney General's Office says it has evidence Zorrilla, 47,
ordered the killing of Buendia, whom he had known for 15 years, when
he learned the columnist planned to expose his links to prominent
drug traffickers.
   The office said Mora was arrested Tuesday and booked ``on
suspicion of being one of the material authors'' in the slaying of
Buendia. A police source, who insisted on anonymity, said
authorities had evidence indicating Mora was the ``triggerman.''
   Under Mexican law, Mora must be arraigned within 24 hours or the
case will be thrown out for lack of evidence.
   The attorney general's office said Mora, when questioned by a
city prosecutor, denied he had anything to do with the shooting,
saying: ``When I arrived he (Buendia) was already dead.''
   The government news agency Notimex identified Mora as the
grandson of former Puebla Gov. Maximino Avila Camacho, a onetime
Secretary of Communications and Transportation.
   Notimex said Mora was also a grandnephew of Manuel Avila Camacho,
who was president of Mexico from 1940 to 1946.
   A 1973 graduate from the Judiciary Police Technical School, Mora
worked for various law enforcement agencies before joinging the
Federal Security Administration in 1982 as a member of an ``elite''
group of 20 special agents, the Attorney General's office said in
its statement.
   Mora had been a member of a rock group and played bit parts as an
actor in at least four horror and crime movies. He is still a member
ANDA, the National Actors' Association.
   Zorrilla was director of the Federal Security Administration from
1982 until the government dissolved it in 1985 because of widespread
corruption.
   The Attorney General's office said in a statement Tuesday that it
had evidence that Zorrilla received millions of dollars a month in
bribes from drug baron Rafael Caro Quintero to allow the smuggling
of large quantities of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the
United States.
   Caro Quintero is awaiting trial for the 1985 torture-slaying of
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena Salazar
and his Mexican pilot Miguel Zavala Avelar in Guadalajara.
   The attorney general's office said Zorrilla also had links to
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, reputedly the country's top drug
trafficker, who was arrested earlier this year.
   Zorrilla, who was first on the scene minutes after Buendia was
shot, conducted the preliminary investigation in the case. He has
also been indicted on charges of obstructing justice and abuse of
authority.

   The Senate Commerce Committee has approved
legislation to toughen penalties for drug sales at truck stops and
highway rest areas.
   The legislation also would ban trucking companies from hauling
hazardous materials and bus companies from carrying passengers if
they receive an ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating from the
Transportation Department.
   The measure, sent to the full Senate on Tuesday, provides for
doubling and tripling of existing penalties for crimes involving
drug sales at truck stops and rest areas. It also would establish

<HEAD>Warner Lawyers Say Time Buyout Violates FCC Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications says Paramount's
multibillion-dollar attempt to buy Time Inc. violates the 1984 Cable
Act and Federal Communications Commission rules.
   But lawyers for Paramount Communications, which launched a $10.7
billion hostile tender offer for Time after Time announced a
proposed $18 billion merger with Warner, told the FCC on Tuesday it
should set aside its previous ruling allowing Time to transfer
control of its cable TV systems to Time-Warner.
   Paramount said Time had misrepresented to its stockholders the
nature of the transfer and that Time had written to state attorneys
general asking them to oppose Paramount's proposal without notifying
Paramount of the letters.
   These actions raise ``questions about Time's character
qualifications,'' Paramount said, asking the FCC to set aside its
approval of the license transfers pending an investigation.
   The filings were the latest round of high-stakes corporate
manuevering in which the three parties are trying to create the
world's largest entertainment and media conglomerate.
   After the Time-Warner merger was announced in March, Paramount
weighed in with its hostile takeover offer. But Time fired back
Friday with a $12.6 billion offer to buy Warner.
   Besides the tussle over transfer of cable licenses, the battle is
expected to be waged in court in Delaware, where all three companies
are incorporated.
   Paramount earlier this month asked the FCC for permission to give
control of Time to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld pending
FCC approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and
licenses held by Time's 82-percent-owned subsidiary, American
Television and Communications Corp.
   Art Harding, a lawyer for Warner, said Tuesday that Paramount's
request ``would violate the recent Cable Act because Rumsfeld hasn't
gotten consent from any of these cities for the transfers.''
   Harding, echoing assertions Time made against Paramount in a June
13 FCC filing, said Paramount's plan would ``undermine the delicate
balance'' established in the 1984 Cable Act for regulation of cable
systems by local authorities.
   Warner asked the FCC late Monday to deny the application made by
Paramount and its subsidiary, KDS Acquisition Corp., for expedited
consent to transfer control of Time to Rumsfeld and then to
Paramount.
   Warner said Paramount's plan called for an ``unprecedented
extension'' to the cable TV industry of FCC rules that cover hostile
tender offers for broadcast licenses. It said the FCC can allow
transfer of a broadcaster even before it decides the receiving party
is qualified to hold broadcast licenses, but cable franchises must
be transferred by local authorities and the FCC has no say.

<HEAD>Technician Dies From Monkey Virus; 21 Co-Workers at Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A technician who apparently contracted a
rare form of herpes from a laboratory monkey's bite has died, and 21
co-workers are at significant risk of infection, officials say.
   The technician, whose name was withheld, was infected with herpes
B virus, also known as monkey herpes. It attacks the brain and
nervous system and kills more than 70 percent of people who catch
it, scientists say.
   The 23-year-old victim, an employee of International Research and
Development Corp. in Mattawan, about 10 miles west of Kalamazoo,
died Tuesday afternoon at Bronson Methodist Hospital, said hospital
spokesman Bill Russell.
   Authorities have tested 110 people who worked at the lab or had
contact with the victim, said Dr. William Hall of the state
Department of Public Health. He said 21 employees have significant
risk of catching the disease because monkeys have bitten or
scratched them.
   James Webb, a spokesman for the company, said the bite was not
immediately reported.
   ``We are deeply saddened by the loss of an employee from the
extremely rare B virus and are further saddened that this unreported
incident did not allow preventive measures to be taken that could
have spared his life,'' he said.
   Webb said guidelines for handling such bites and scratches are
established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
   The disease is common among Old World monkeys, which can spread
it through bites or scratches when it is in the active phase.
   Test results are pending on the 21 people, who will require
retesting in three to four weeks because of the disease's incubation
period, Hall said.
   There have been 30 cases of monkey herpes among humans reported
in the United States since 1932, said Hall. Only one of those cases
was spread by human-to-human contact.

<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange made up
earlier losses to close higher today while the U.S. dollar surged
against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 111.81
points, or 0.34 percent, finishing at 33,345.28 after reversing a
downward trend earlier in the day. It was a 220.29-point winner
Tuesday.
   The dollar ended trading at 144.95 yen, up 1.15 yen from
Tuesday's close of 143.80 yen. It opened at 144.85 yen and traded
between 144.73 yen and 144.03 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's strength was based on overnight gains
in overseas markets.
   ``Investors still want to invest in dollar assets, but the
dollar's value fell so suddenly last week that they are not buying
aggressively,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese city bank, who
spoke anonymously.
   The U.S. dollar fluctuated wildly last week, closing at 151.30
yen last Thursday and then plummeting 6.25 yen on Friday to close at
145.05 yen.
   On the stock exchange, brokers said the index began to rise when
trust investment companies conducted arbitrage deals between the
spot and the futures markets. Bargain hunting in the first section
also pushed prices higher, they said.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Guilty On All Counts In Perjury Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto AX1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Swindall, eight months ago a congressman and
one day ago a Senate hopeful, now stands convicted of lying to a
grand jury investigating a drug-related money laundering sting.
   ``Obviously, I'm very disappointed,'' said the 38-year-old
conservative Republican, who lost re-election in November following
his perjury indictment.
   He was convicted Tuesday of all nine counts and faces a possible
10 months to five years in prison and $250,000 fine on each count.
Sentencing was scheduled for Aug. 25.
   Probation is not an option under new federal sentencing
guidelines, which Swindall supported as a congressman.
   Swindall, who spent two terms representing Atlanta's eastern
suburbs, had hoped for an acquittal and a 1990 race against Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga. Now, barring a victory on appeal, he will go to prison
after his Aug. 25 sentencing.
   Swindall sat impassively in the federal courtroom as the jury
announced its verdict on the 22nd day of his trial. His wife, Kim,
rested her hand on his back.
   ``I could have understood one or two counts, but I just don't
understand this,'' he told companions as he headed to a probation
office.
   Later, he told reporters he would appeal.
   ``This process is not over,'' he said. ``We'll be trying this
case again, and, I hope, not in Atlanta.''
   Swindall's attorneys asked before and during the trial for his
case to be moved because of pretrial publicity.
   He said he ``had gotten involved in something I never should have
gotten involved in, but I've said I had been 100 percent truthful
before the grand jury. That hasn't changed.''
   Swindall, who went to Congress in 1984, was defeated in November
by Democrat Ben Jones, a former TV actor in ``The Dukes of
Hazzard,'' while under the cloud of the perjury indictment.
   Swindall was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in his Feb.
2, 1988, testimony concerning his month-long 1987 negotiations with
an undercover Internal Revenue Service agent and with a Swindall
supporter later convicted of money laundering. The IRS agent was
posing as a drug-money launderer.
   The government said Swindall was seeking $850,000 to complete
construction on his luxurious suburban home; the money was to be
funneled to Swindall through a mortgage company created by his
friend and political supporter, Charles LeChasney, authorities said.
   Swindall had been accused of 10 counts that said he made 20 false
statements to the grand jury. The judge dropped one count, and the
jurors Tuesday found 18 to be willful lies.
   Specifically, they found that he lied when he said he didn't
recall being told the money included narcotics dollars, when he said
he never agreed to accept the money and when he said a $150,000
check he received _ but later returned _ had nothing to do with the
deal.
   ``To me, this is among the most important, if not the most
important, case we've handled,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Barr. He
noted that Swindall, as a congressman, not only swore to uphold the
laws, but helped make them.
   ``Even people at that high level of public life must be held
accountable for their misdeeds,'' Barr said.
   Swindall, a lawyer, said the trial included at least two ``very
reversible errors'' which he hopes will win him a new trial:
Freeman's dismissal of the testimony of Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
that House members have an overwhelming workload, and a prosecutor's
remark concerning the possible motivation of defendants to testify
during criminal trials.
   Swindall did not testify in his own defense.
   Neither area, however, directly addressed the bulk of the case:
hours of secretly tape-recorded conversations between Swindall,
LeChasney and IRS undercover agent Michael Mullaney.
   In those tapes, heard by the jury, Swindall was told the money he
was seeking ``certainly'' included drug money, was told he would be
part of an operation to ``wash'' cash, and proposed that a mortgage
company be set up as a ``buffer'' to funnel him the money. The deal
eventually collapsed.
   Swindall said he is ``considering a number of different career
options. One of those I've got to put into the blend is a prison
ministry.
   ``I will go where God sends me. ... God doesn't make mistakes.''
   The lanky, boyish-looking Swindall won his House seat in a 1984
upset. In his two terms, he staunchly voted with the Reagan right.

<TEXT>
   The government today said exports rose slightly in
May while imports soared, a situation reflecting China's recent
economic and political turmoil.
   According to customs authorities, China exported $4.43 billion of
goods in May, up 0.8 percent over the same month in 1988.
   Imports were up 21.1 percent to $5.31 billion in the same period,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.
   The customs figures showed exports for the first five months of
the year were up 4.7 percent to $18 billion, while imports jumped
24.4 percent to $22.67 billion _ a trade imbalance of $4.6 billion
that was $3.8 billion more than the first five months of 1988.
   The report did not cite reasons for the worsening trade situation.
   However, the nation is suffering from increasingly serious
shortages of raw materials and energy and has had to divert some
important export items, such as coal and oil, to the domestic market
while importing more raw materials for its processing industries.
   Politically, Beijing was hit in May by the pro-democracy student
demonstrations that disrupted some factory production and distracted
the national leadership.
   The trade situation is expected to worsen in June, when the
military killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing, triggering
unrest throughout the nation.

   As the sun rises over Kelly Mountain, mine
superintendent Ronnie Gibson drives past union pickets at the crest
of the hill and takes his place amid machinery idled by a wildcat
strike.
   When his neighbor, Junie Dials, tries to reach the same Island
Creek Corp. mine at the start of his evening shift, he gets no
further than the pickets and retreats to Buddy's Carryout in nearby
Accoville.
   It's a script they expect to follow as long as wildcat strikes in
10 states continue against coal companies, including the Island
Creek mine here in southern West Virginia about 50 miles south of
Charleston.
   ``I have to make an attempt to go,'' Dials said, sneaking a
cigarette at the Buddy's lunch counter Tuesday. ``Our contract says
we have to go to work.'' A union contract, however, doesn't mean
much these days in the coal fields. Despite a no-strike clause in
their pact, 28,000 United Mine Workers members have walked off the
job in sympathy with striking Pittston Coal Group Inc. workers in
Virginia, West Virgina and Kentucky.
   As Tuesday wound down, Gibson and Dials returned to their homes
15 miles away in Man _ Gibson to his tan, wooden home on Burgess
Street; Dials to the big white house just around the corner on Main
Street. They got together later at Gibson's house to talk about the
day.
   ``I have no idea when I'll be back at work,'' Dials said. ``I'd
be tickled to death to go back to work. I want to work.''
   Each day, the 40-year-old Dials has driven to the top of Kelly
Mountain and, each day, a half-dozen union pickets with bandannas
covering their faces tell him to turn back. Gibson, 48, said he has
had no trouble with the strikers after telling them he is a
supervisor. Beyond that, he has been instructed not to talk.
   ``I can't even tell you my name is Ronnie Gibson,'' he said in
the quiet office of the Island Creek mine.
   At Accoville, where he grew up with Gibson, Dials looks
exasperated when he leans on Buddy's shining lunch counter.
   ``I see the ayatollah released our three men down in Virginia
today,'' Dials said, referring to a federal judge. ``I was tickled
to death about it. I thought they were going to let me go back to
work.''
   The three union leaders in Virginia were jailed after U.S.
District Judge Glen Williams found them guilty of contempt of court
for violating his ban on attempts to block coal trucks at Pittston's
processing plants in Virginia.
   They were freed by Williams after promising during a private
hearing Tuesday to abide by his order.
   In its dispute with the UMW, the Lebanon, Va.,-based Pittston is
seeking a contract separate from one covering most of the nation's
coal companies. Pittson is seeking mandatory overtime, Sunday work
and reduced medical benefits for retirees.
   About 1,600 Pittston miners in Virginia and West Virginia walked
off their jobs April 5 after working more than 14 months without a
contract. Kentucky's 200 Pittston miners joined the walkout Monday.
   There's been little sympathy for Pittston in West Virginia's
Logan County since 1972 when a 200-foot-high Pittston coal refuse
dam broke, wiping the sides of the Buffalo Creek Valley black and
taking 125 people to their deaths.
   ``Pittston didn't show no sympathy when they killed 125 people
here,'' Dials said. ``I'd like to see them run out of the hollow.''
   The state sued Pittston, which settled out of court for $1
million.
   ``I don't think they'll ever have a friend in this hollow
again,'' Dials said.

<HEAD>170 Arrested at Stonehenge in Summer Solstice Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMESBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today arrested at least 170
hippies who they said tried to enter the grounds of the
4,000-year-old Stonehenge monument before dawn to celebrate the
summer solstice.
   Six people managed to scale a fence on the perimeter of the famed
archaeological site before they were detained, and one of them
shouted to reporters, ``Free the stones! Free the people!''
   Wiltshire police said they had warned about 300 people gathered
on a highway near the monument to disperse or face arrest for
breaking a ban on processions within a 4-mile radius of Stonehenge.
   The police, numbering about 800, later moved in on the crowd,
making arrests on the highway and in and around Amesbury, a village
2 miles from Stonehenge.
   Stonehenge is a mysterious double circle of gigantic standing
stones set in Salisbury Plain about 80 miles southwest of London. It
is thought to have been a center for pre-Christian and astronomical
worship, because the sun rises over a particular stone.
   Most arrests were made for breaches of the Public Order Act
banning processions within the exclusion zone, police said.
Violators faced a maximum three-month prison sentence.
   Police denied access to modern-day druid sun worshipers who in
previous years have celebrated the summer solstice, the longest day
of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, with a ritual sunrise
ceremony at Stonehenge.
   About a dozen youths who evaded roadblocks and tried to reach the
site under cover of darkness were arrested as they crossed fields.
   Police closed all roads to the public and dozens of officers
protected by visors patrolled on horses.
   ``Our aim was to avoid confrontation and violence and we have
achieved that,'' said Wiltshire deputy police Superintendent Allan
Elliott. ``Our second aim was to make sure an illegal festival was
not established and that also has been achieved. The run-up to the
solstice was very quiet this year.''
   About 2,000 of the hippies gathered for a music festival on
specially allocated farmland in Somerset, 40 miles away.
   In the past, the hippies have held loosely organized music
festivals at Stonehenge coinciding with the solstice, when the sun
reaches its greatest distance from the equator.
   The festivals, held since the early 1970's, have been banned
since 1985 because of complaints of drug-taking and property damage.

<TEXT>
   A black man who insisted he was unjustly
convicted by an all-white jury was executed in the gas chamber early
today for a five-day robbery spree in which three people were slain.
   Leo Edwards Jr., 36, of New Orleans, appeared to gasp for breath
and shrug his shoulders several times as the cyanide gas swirled
around him.
   He was declared dead at 12:15 a.m., minutes after being strapped
into a chair in the gas chamber.
   Edwards was the fourth person executed at the state penitentiary
at Parchman and the 113th in the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
   Edwards was executed for the June 14, 1980, shooting death of
Jackson convenience store clerk Linzy Don Dixon. The robbery netted
$111 and came during a spree in Hinds and Madison counties in which
two other people were killed and two were wounded.
   Also participating in the spree was Mike White, who escaped with
Edwards from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.
   White is serving two life terms after pleading guilty to murder
in the death of Dixon and a bar owner.
   Defense attorneys protested that prosecutors deliberately
excluded blacks from the jury, denying Edwards a fair trial.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court voted 7-2 against a stay, and
Gov. Ray Mabus rejected Edwards' plea for clemency.
   ``I will not stand in the way of the courts' justice. ... Leo
Edwards is a mass murderer who killed in cold blood,'' Mabus said.
``He tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the courts, and
discrimination had no bearing in his case. ...
   ``Leo Edwards' sentence is a result of his own crime, and his
fate now rests in God's hands,'' the governor said.
   But in a newspaper interview published Tuesday, Edwards
maintained his innocence and insisted he did not receive a fair
trial, even though four different appeals courts rejected arguments
that prosecutors deliberately excluded blacks from the jury.
   ``You know how I felt when I saw (the all-white) jury?'' Edwards
was quoted as saying. ``I said, `I'm dead.'''

<HEAD>Dieter Sheds 173 Pounds, Donates Excess Skin to Burn Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-month-old boy with severe burns was the first
beneficiary of Dennis Genz's decision to donate 4 square feet of his
excess skin to a hospital burn unit.
   Genz' diet recently allowed him to shed 170 pounds, but left him
with a large flap of skin on his abdomen, which was removed
surgically Monday.
   ``There have been rare cases where parents have donated skin for
their children,'' Betty Perls, education director for the Regional
Organ Bank of Illinois, said Tuesday. ``But none of us have ever
heard of a case like this.''
   The 5-foot-11 Genz weighed 430 pounds last August when he began a
high-protein weight-loss regimen. Last week, he weighed in at 260.
   He said the operation removed 19{ pounds of skin and adjoining
tissue.
   Some of the skin went to Dexter Moore, a 3-month-old victim of a
fire in Indiana.
   When the infant was admitted, he was suffering from smoke
inhalation and burns to his face, head and arms. It was a
life-threatening situation, said John Easton, spokesman at the
University of Chicago Medical Center.
   Now, said Easton, ``he's doing well.''
   More lives are saved by skin transplants than any other donated
organ, said Dr. Lawrence Gottlieb, professor of surgery and director
of the hospital's burn unit.
   Most donated skin comes from cadavers, Ms. Perls said.
   Donated skin ``is used as a kind of living bandage'' while the
patient regenerates his own skin, Ms. Perls said. Then the borrowed
tissue is shed.
   Because its use is temporary, skin used for burn patients need
not be a perfect match like that used for skin grafts or other organ
transplants, Ms. Perls said.
   Genz, a 43-year-old equipment coordinator for the emergency
department at Sherman Hospital in Elgin, said the idea for donating
the skin came while he was eating lunch with some nurses.
   ``We were joking that it was too bad I couldn't donate the
skin,'' he said.
   ``Then one of the nurses said, `Why not?''' he recalled Tuesday
from his hospital bed, where he was recovering from Monday's surgery.
   The decision ``left me with a good feeling,'' Genz said, adding
he was feeling fine despite ``kind of a big scar.''

<HEAD>Rain Still Scattered Across the East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered through the East this
morning after a day of storms that caused flooding in several states
and contributed to at least two traffic deaths in the Atlanta area.
   More than 2{ inches of rain fell in the Atlanta area Tuesday,
causing minor street flooding. About 30 miles to the southwest, the
Chattahoochee River was forecast to crest almost a foot above flood
stage today.
   Former Paulding County Commission Chairman Donald C. Watson was
killed and his wife injured when a 70-foot-tall oak tree toppled
onto their car as they were driving through the Kennesaw Mountain
National Battlefield Park in Cobb County.
   Elizabeth Farris was killed and her husband, former Fulton County
Commissioner Milton Farris, was injured when their car hydroplaned
into a moving van north of Atlanta, Fulton County police said.
   Heavy rains also exacerbated flooding in eastern and central
Alabama, where rainfall ranged from 2 inches to more than 5 inches
on Tuesday. The Tallapoosa River was expected to crest 8 to 9 feet
above flood stage at Milstead today.
   Fifteen to 20 families were evacuated from trailer homes in
low-lying areas of Tallapoosa County and floods destroyed half the
county's cotton crop, authorities said.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms continued this morning from
Florida to New England and the lower Great Lakes.
   Minor flooding closed some roads and bridges in western
Pennsylvania and eastern Tennessee Tuesday. Several dozen homes were
evacuated in Tennessee, and a rockslide closed the westbound lanes
of Interstate 40 near Rockwood. No injuries were reported.
   Thunderstorms produced large hail and damaging winds in Nebraska
and South Dakota on Tuesday evening. Storms continued in northwest
and southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota and northeast Nebraska.
   Today's forecast called for widespread showers and thunderstorms
from the upper Ohio Valley through the Appalachians and much of the
Carolinas into the Florida Panhandle; scattered showers from New
England and along the Atlantic Coast into the Florida Peninsula;
scattered showers and thunderstorms across the northern and central
Plains into the eastern slopes of the northern and central Rockies;
and rain entering northwest Washington state.
   Highs were expected to be in the 80s or 90s across much of the
nation; in the 60s from northern Washington state across the
northern Rockies into the northern Plains; in the 70s from other
parts of the Pacific Northwest through to western and central
Nebraska and western and northern Minnesota, and from the eastern
Great Lakes into the central Appalachians; and between 100 and 110
degrees in southern portions of New Mexico, Arizona and California
and the California valleys.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 94 degrees at Glendale, Ariz.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, trying to keep
its head above $2.6 billion in debt, has gone fishing for a new
owner for Shamu the killer whale and its Sea World theme parks.
   The Orlando-based publishing and entertainment giant also put up
for sale two other central Florida attractions, Boardwalk &amp; Baseball
and Cypress Gardens, plus all land holdings. Estimates of the worth
of the package ranged from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion.
   ``We know most every employee in the parks,'' HBJ's longtime
chairman, William Jovanovich, told reporters Tuesday. ``And it hurts
a little bit to think that you're going to say goodbye to part of
your family. But we're not going to do it unless it's done rightly.''
   Financial analysts say the sale of the parks will help beef up a
balance sheet weakened by huge debts acquired to repel an unfriendly
takeover attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell. To counter
Maxwell's unsolicited bid of $2 billion in May 1987, Harcourt
adopted a takeover defense that weighed it down with in debt.
   ``HBJ is about $2.6 billion in debt and has a deficit of $1.5
billion in stockholder equity ... so this is a positive development
for the company,'' said Robert Dunlap of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp;
Co. in New York.
   Harcourt was the second-most active issue on the New York Stock
Exchange on Tuesday following the morning announcement with 3.75
million shares changing hands. The stock rose $3.75 to close Tuesday
at $13.875.
   During the past two years, Harcourt has disposed of
trade-magazine and school-supply interests, streamlined its theme
parks division and reshuffled its publishing operations _ all of
which included huge reductions in personnel.
   But that wasn't enough, according to some analysts who had
foreseen the sale of an entire operating division as the only way to
pay off the debt.
   ``The first love of this company is publishing,'' said Elizabeth
Bramwell of the brokerage Gabelli &amp; Co. in New York. ``They
shouldn't have been doing all these (other) things.''
   The marine parks are in Orlando, San Diego, San Antonio, and
Aurora, Ohio, near Cleveland. Shamu is the stage name given to the
performing whales at the parks. The land for sale is about 1,000
acres in Florida and San Antonio.
   HBJ, the nation's largest textbook publisher, lost $126.5
million, or $2.04 a share, last year compared with a 1987 profit of
$64.4 million, or $1.34 a share.

   Today was the summer solstice, the longest day
of the year.
   The solstice occurred at 5:53 a.m. EDT, the moment during the
summer when the sun is farthest from the equator in the Northern
Hemisphere.
   The date has popularly been listed by calendar makers as the
official start of summer, although that title carries no official
weight. For example, meteorologists consider that summer began June
1.
   The summer solstice has also traditionally been known in folklore
as midsummer and has been a time for parties and other celebrations.

to land on his own.
   The airport was closed to commercial traffic because of the

<HEAD>Statewide High School Tests Canceled After Newspaper Publishes Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state is looking for ways to keep its
high school achievement tests under wraps after it was forced to
cancel an exam when the answers were published in the New York Post.
   The newspaper, saying it was showing that illicitly obtained
tests were widely available, published the answer sheet to a
chemistry test Tuesday, the day it was to be given to an estimated
80,000 students across the state.
   Officials probing the theft of the test results have found the
exams were widely available to students in New York City, said
Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol. Tests in biology, math, French
and global studies also were reported to be available, he said.
   ``We are considering several measures which will improve our
security in the future,'' Sobol said.
   Thomas Gilles, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said
the office was investigating reports the tests and results were
being sold for $2,000, although some tests were available for as
little as $5 or $10 the night before the exam.
   The regents tests, given in 17 subjects over a one-week period in
late June, are taken by high school students and generally account
for a portion of a students' grade.
   After the Post published the chemistry answers, they were quickly
distributed through copy and fax machines across the state, forcing
only the second cancelation in the test's history.
   Jerry Nachman, editor of the Post, said it took a reporter 15
minutes to find a copy of a test after he was assigned to check
reports they were stolen.
   He said the test results were published on the front page as a
service to students who were planning to take the exam legitimately
when there was so much cheating going on.
   ``Their inability to recognize the ingenuity of teen-agers,
coupled with the proliferation of photocopiers and fax machines, was
silly,'' Nachman said.
   Sobol said the department believed it could contain the damage to
New York City and that the tests could have been given elsewhere in
the state on Tuesday. But several hours after the newspaper was
published, it became clear this was impossible, he said.
   The Education Department is considering suing the Post for the
cost of preparing and giving a replacement test, said Sobol's
spokeswoman, Linda Fisher. She estimated those costs at $250,000.
   ``If they want to sue us, fine,'' Nachman said. ``I think the
discovery will be very revealing to us and all our colleagues in the
press.''
   In Plattsburgh, near the Canadian border, Plattsburgh High School
junior Katie King said she was relieved, but the cancellation left a
nagging doubt.
   ``In a way, I'm curious what I would have gotten on the regents
... in a way I'm kind of disappointed,'' she said.

   Authorities detained Burma's main
opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, while she was laying wreaths
today to honor demonstrators killed a year ago by the military,
official sources said.
   She and the 15 followers rounded up with her were released after
an hour-long interrogation, said the sources, who asked for
anonymity.
   Witnesses said Aung San Suu Kyi and the others were taken away in
open military trucks to a government office near where the ceremony
took place.
   No official statement has been made about the incident at
Myeinigon, four miles north of downtown Rangoon.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of deceased national hero Gen.
Aung San, held a religious ceremony with her followers at a branch
office of her National League for Democracy and then walked to the
spot where several demonstrators were shot by police last June 21.
   Several hundred people were present at the wreath-laying when
authorities moved in.
   In recent months, Aung San Suu Kyi has been harassed on occasion
but generally been given considerable leeway by the military
government to campaign throughout the country.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, a charismatic, 44-year-old political neophyte,
is widely regarded as the most powerful opposition figure in Burma
and her party appears to have the biggest backing among the 200-odd
parties that have mushroomed.
   She returned to Rangoon from London, her home for many years, to
look after her ailing mother in April 1988, and became embroiled in
the political turmoil sweeping Burma.
   She became one of the main leaders of a pro-democracy uprising
that seemed on the verge of toppling 26 years of authoritarian rule
through massive street demonstrations.
   But last September, Gen. Saw Maung and a group of military
officers brutally crushed the student-led protests and clamped
martial law on the country.
   The new leaders allowed the formation of opposition political
parties and have promised free general elections next year. But
opponents like Aung San Suu Kyi have remained skeptical about the
balloting.
   Aung San Suu Kyi joined with two popular leaders, retired Brig.
Gen. Aung Gyi and onetime Defense Minister Tin Oo to form the league
of which she is general secretary and Tin Oo president. Aung Gyi
later left the group, claiming the league was being infiltrated by
communists.

   Vietnam today returned the remains of
what it says are 28 American servicemen missing from the Vietnam
War, and is ready to repatriate 16 others, a U.S. military spokesman
said.
   A 21-member U.S. military team, headed by Lt. Col. James D.
Spurgeon, received the remains in a ceremony at Hanoi's
international airport, said Maj. Dan Trout, who accompanied the
mission.
   Trout said it was learned that 16 others remains would be turned
over to the United States but no date has been set.
   Today's repatriation was the 10th since August 1987, when a
senior delegation to Hanoi obtained promises from the Vietnamese to
step up efforts to resolve the issue of the missing in action, or
MIAs.
   Trout said the remains were delivered in wooden boxes, inspected
by a U.S. forensic expert and then transferred into aluminum
caskets. An honor guard saluted as an American flag was placed atop
each each casket before being loaded into a C-141 transport aircraft.
   The aircraft, which flew into Hanoi from Bangkok earlier today,
was scheduled to make a refueling stop on Guam before flying on to
Honolulu for identification at a U.S. military laboratory.
   With today's turn-over, 212 remains will have been returned since
August, 1987, with 56 identified to date as those of American
servicemen. Hanoi has also allowed joint U.S.-Vietnamese search
teams to investigate MIA cases in the Vietnamese countryside.
   The U.S. Defense Department says 2,353 Americans are still listed
MIA from the Indochina war, including 1,719 in Vietnam, 545 in Laos,
83 in Cambodia and six in China.
   Some Americans believe Vietnam is also holding live Americans but
Hanoi has repeatedly denied this.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traffic jams started at dawn today in London as
commuters contended with one-day strikes by rail, bus and subway
workers over pay and working conditions.
   ``By 6 a.m. the traffic buildup was what it is usually like at 8
a.m.,'' said a Scotland Yard spokesman. Many city parking lots were
full by 6:30 a.m.
   Perhaps because of the early start, the Automobile Association
reported, the usual jams on the six-lane M25 motorway that circles
the city were no worse than usual.
   The strike by 75,000 railroad workers was the first national rail
strike since 1982.
   London had the worst problems because of a strike called Tuesday
night by 18,500 bus workers to coincide with the strike by the
capital's 10,500 subway workers. The subway strike was the seventh
unofficial 24-hour walkout in 11 weeks in London.
   London's red double-decker buses and sprawling subway network
carry more than 3 million passengers daily, while British Rail
carries 2 million passengers a day.
   ``I saw a car with three bikes on the roof, two in the back, and
five people in the car. I guess they just drive as far as they can
and get on their bikes,'' said Patrick Gilligan of London Bicycle Co.
   Barclays Bank and the Midland Bank hired buses and organized
pickup points to get their employees to work. Some companies hired
taxis or booked hotel rooms in central London.
   ``The chances of getting a hotel room near the (financial
district) now are very, very slim,'' said Stephen Kaye, managing
director of Room Center UK, a hotel booking agency.
   The Royal Mail warned of delays in first- and second-class mail,
and all time off for London police was suspended.
   The Independent, a London daily, ran a front-page cartoon today
showing a man holding a briefcase and addressing his tearful family:
``I'm just going to work _ I may be gone some time.''
   At Gatwick Airport, British Airways chartered 27 buses to help
make up for the lack of rail service, which normally carries about
24,000 airline passengers and employees daily.
   No serious traffic congestion was reported Glasgow, Britain's
second-largest city, where subway service was not affected.
   Police in Liverpool reported no unusual problems.
   
   In Parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
condemned the strikers for ``a typically selfish policy to put
themselves first ... deliberately causing massive inconvenience to
those who have to work.''
   Earlier, the Court of Appeal refused a request by British Rail to
block the planned walkout.
   Union members voted 29,675 to 20,704 to strike over British
Rail's proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolish
national wage bargaining.
   British Rail, which says the strike will cost it $15.5 million,
offered to return to the negotiating table and urged staff to ignore
the strike call.
   When subway workers decided Tuesday to go ahead with their
stoppage over pay and work conditions, delegates representing bus
workers in the Transport and General Workers Union decided on a
24-hour strike to demand a 14 percent pay rise.
   They rejected an offer of 8 percent to 9 percent, which London
Buses said was ``roughly in line with inflation,'' now 8.3 percent
annually. The company said a bus driver operating without a
conductor earns $340 a week.
   The dispute between London Underground and workers on the
248-station subway involves trains now operated only by drivers.
Drivers want a $99 weekly increase to operate without a guard.
   Management is offering $46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation,
but is tying the raise to increased productivity.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Superpowers Beginning to Act Like Partners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff today that his visit was
evidence the superpowers are viewing each other more as partners
than adversaries.
   Gorbachev met Adm. William J. Crowe in a Kremlin office on the
last day of a 10-day visit in which Crowe viewed military exercises
in Byelorussia, looked at a Soviet nuclear submarine and traveled
widely in the Soviet Union.
   ``The very fact that you have visited the Soviet Union and have
visited military facilities and units demonstrates that we are
moving from the notion of enemies to the notion of partners,''
Gorbachev told Crowe in the presence of a handful of reporters.
   ``I believe that in the plans made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
we are still considered to be adversaries, but the process is going
along new lines, and this is extremely significant,'' the president
said.
   Crowe, accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock, then met with
Gorbachev, his military adviser Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev and
military Chief of Staff Mikhail A. Moiseyev for about an hour.
   ``Obviously there still are differences in our points of view,''
especially on arms control, Crowe said at a news conference later.
But he added, ``The atmosphere for discussing them has improved
markedly.
   ``I believe we now have an environment in which we can talk
candidly, ask the kinds of questions that are important, we can talk
without rancor or emotion,'' he said.
   Crowe's visit followed a trip by Akhromeyev to the United States.
He is to leave Moscow early Thursday.
   The visit came as the United States and Soviet Union resumed
talks in Geneva on reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear
missiles, negotiations that were stalled by disagreements and the
change of U.S. administrations.
   The two sides also are engaged in negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and conventional forces in Europe.
   Crowe spent much of his visit assessing changes in Soviet
military policy under Gorbachev. The policy is based on the concept
of ``reasonable sufficiency,'' that the country only needs enough
soldiers and military hardware to defend itself.
   Gorbachev has said the nation needs to redirect resources from
the military to satisfy pent-up domestic demand for food and
consumer goods.
   Crowe told a Moscow military academy last week that the Soviet
Union still has ``overwhelming numbers'' and that he assumes it
might attack.
   But he also said the Soviet Union must be given time to make good
on promises to cut the size of its armed forces by 500,000 soldiers,
take 500 nuclear weapons out of Eastern Europe and withdraw tanks
and artillery.
   ``There is change afoot in this country, politically and
militarily,'' Crow said today, adding that he found Gorbachev ``very
impressive.''
   Crowe said Gorbachev's plan to withdraw 500 tactical nuclear
weapons from Eastern Europe and President Bush's proposals on
reducing conventional forces made him optimistic about superpower
arms talks.
   ``We now believe there are some positive offers, some
constructive offers on the table, that both sides are serious and
sincere and that we can now continue the process of negotiations and
some optimism,'' Crowe said.
   But he said that it is dangerous for arms control negotiators to
be rushed by a desire on both sides for disarmament.

<HEAD>Former Miller Brewing Employee Wins Worker's Comp Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brewery employees drove a jittery Vietnam
veteran over the edge by making sudden loud noises so they could
watch him throw himself to the floor, a panel ruled in awarding him
$86,000 in worker's compensation.
   ``This is a case where the human insensitivity often witnessed in
the children's schoolyard has reappeared in the adult workplace,''
two administrative law judges wrote in a decision in favor of John
E. Beverly, 42, of Waterloo.
   ``Such callous behavior is not merely reprehensible, but a
disgrace.''
   Co-workers at Miller Brewing Co. learned he had been diagnosed as
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, including an
exaggerated startle reaction, and ``preyed upon this startle
reaction apparently for amusement or perhaps outright cruelty,''
said Judges Randall R. Kaiser and Nancy L. Schneiders.
   From 1981 to 1983, co-workers dropped tables, broke beer bottles,
dropped heavy equipment from forklifts, popped empty milk cartons
and paper cups and set off fireworks.
   Beverly responded with a flash of fear and an increased heart
rate and jumped or threw himself to the floor.
   A rocket set off in the lunchroom in Beverly's direction so
unnerved him that he was hospitalized for seven months for
psychiatric treatment, the judges said last week.
   Beverly, who left his job as a production worker in 1983 and
never returned, suffers chronic anxiety, distrust of other people,
depression, anxiety attacks and nightmares, the judges found.
   Miller and its insurance companies said the harassment or
horseplay was not directed at Beverly, or if it was, it was not
unusual stress. They also said his post-traumatic stress disorder
resulted from combat, not what occurred at work.
   But the judges ruled that ``the campaign of terror and
harassment'' was out-of-the-ordinary stress and noted that six
psychiatrists and six psychologist found that Beverly's current
problems resulted from harassment.
   His lawyer, Arthur Heitzer, said Tuesday that Beverly had not
worked since leaving Miller.
   The brewer and its insurers have three weeks to appeal.
   Miller spokesman Peter Acly said the company was reviewing the
decision.

<HEAD>Justice Department Charges Chicago Heights Over Group Home for Retarded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department has sued a suburb for
denying a zoning permit for a home for retarded adults.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday was the first brought by the federal
government alleging housing discrimination against the handicapped
under the Fair Housig Amendments Act that went into effect March 12,
the department said.
   The department contends the Chicago Heights City Council denied
the request in May because of neighbors' opposition ``based on fears
and prejudices concerning the mentally retarded.''
   The council in the suburb of 32,000 people denied a special-use
permit for construction of a home for 15 adults in a neighborhood of
single-family and two-family homes.
   Chicago Heights Police Commissioner John Gliottoni, one of the
five council members, said the council followed recommendations of
the city's zoning board and its planning commission, as it almost
always does.
   ``They are the sounding boards,'' Gliottoni said. ``They listen
to all the people who are for it and all the people who are against
it. We as council members have no input whatsoever.''
   James P. Turner, acting assistant attorney general in charge of
the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said the case
``signals our determination to make sure that the handicapped enjoy
the full benefits of the protections the act gives them.''
   Under the new Fair Housing act, ``stereotypes and baseless fears
concerning the handicapped cannot be used to block the development
of group homes,'' Turner said in the statement from Washington.
   The lawsuit asks the federal court in Chicago to bar Chicago
Heights from interfering with construction of the home and to assess
unspecified damages and a penalty.
   Turner defended the concept of group homes, which have
encountered opposition from prospective neighbors and delaying
tactics around the country.
   ``Studies have shown that these facilities are better for
residents than the out-of-sight, out-of-mind institutions of the
past, and that they have no adverse effects on the neighborhood,''
he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Rejects Move to Kill Trident</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs penultimate graf, Earlier the subcommittee, to restore

   A House subcommittee says the Pentagon should
be allowed to keep the Trident submarine in its 1990 budget, but it
wants a study on whether the one-a-year purchases are necessary.
   The House Armed Services seapower subcommittee on Tuesday
rejected 8-3 a plan by Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., to replace
the $1.28 billion Trident with a smaller Los Angeles-class attack
submarine.
   The attack subs are made by both the Newport News Shipbuilding
Co. in Virginia and the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics
Corp. in Connecticut. The Trident is made exclusively by Electric
Boat.
   The Reagan administration budget had called for a Trident and two
attack subs, but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney scratched one attack
submarine from his revised budget in a cost-cutting move.
   Earlier this year, Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., and Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
called for scaling back the yearly purchases of Tridents in light of
U.S.-Soviet arms control advances.
   The subcommittee, in a closed session, voted 7-4 to reject a
Foglietta amendment to eliminate $140.6 million requested by Cheney
for a Trident in 1992.
   Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee,
voted against elimination of Trident funding, but pushed through an
amendment requiring the Navy to study whether one Trident a year is
necessary, said Perry Pockros, an aide to Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
   Earlier, the subcommittee rejected 7-6 an amendment to eliminate
a guided missile destroyer requested by Cheney and use the money for
an attack sub, according to David Boomer, an aide to Rep. John
Rowland, R-Conn.
   The Bush administration budget calls for five destroyers and a
single attack sub. This is the last year of the attack subs, which
will be replaced by a new design in future budgets.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes today bombed the
headquarters of a Palestinian guerrilla faction in the hills south
of Beirut, and officials said at least eight guerrillas were wounded.
   The Israeli army said its air force jets attacked targets that
serve as the base for Ahmed Jibril, head of the pro-Syrian Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   A spokesman for the Lebanese Civil Defense said rescuers
evacuated eight wounded guerrillas from the targeted site _ wooded
hills of Naameh overlooking the Mediterranean. The spokesman refused
to say which faction the guerrillas belonged to.
   ``All planes returned safely, and the targets were damaged,'' the
Israeli army said in an announcement from Jerusalem. It made no
mention of casualties.
   It was Israel's ninth air attack into Lebanon this year and the
second in a week.
   On Friday, Israeli warplanes raided south Lebanon's Rashidiyeh
Palestinian refugee camp. Police said two children were wounded in
the attack.
   By police count, nine people have been killed and 60 wounded in
the previous eight Israeli air strikes, which began Jan. 11.
   Jibril's group is headquartered in the Syrian capital, Damascus,
and maintains bases in a chain of tunnels across the Naameh hills.
   A police spokesman said four warplanes blasted the hilltop
positions in six runs spaced over one hour. Thick palls of dust and
smoke billowed from the stricken targets.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party
militia also has bases in the hills, and his militiaman blocked all
roads leading to Naameh, firing AK-47 assault rifles into the air to
prevent reporters from passing checkpoints to the stricken area.
   ``Civilians are not allowed into the area!'' shouted one
militiaman as the raiding jets roared overhead.
   Several Israeli gunboats were seen cruising the Mediterranean off
Naameh.
   Two Israeli helicopter gunships approached the coast, drawing
anti-aircraft fire from Jumblatt's militia and Palestinian
guerrillas, but no hits were observed.
   The Palestinian guerrilla groups with bases in the area also
include George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine; Nayef Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and the Palestine Popular Struggle Front.
   ``But it seems that the main target of the raid is the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,'' said a
Druse militiaman.
   Israeli air, naval and ground forces fought a nine-hour battle
with the faction in the Naameh hills on December 9. At least eight
guerrillas and a ranking Israeli officer were killed.
   Three Israeli soldiers and 16 guerrillas also were wounded in the
December confrontation.
   Jibril held a news conference at the tunnel base shortly after
the December battle and said helicopter-borne Israeli paratroopers
had released a number of Doberman pinschers fitted with tear gas
containers and explosives to chase his fighters across the tunnels.
   Reporters saw five Dobermans killed by guerrillas. The dogs had
explosives and gas containers strapped around their bellies.

<HEAD>Reports: Navy Asked To Look For Jet's Cargo Door Three Miles Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy will search the ocean floor more than
three miles down for the 800-pound cargo door that ripped from a
United Airlines jet on Feb. 24 and sent nine people to their deaths,
according to a news report.
   The Navy operation about 85 miles southwest of Honolulu is
scheduled for October, ABC reported Tuesday.
   A row of seats was sucked through the hole on the New
Zealand-bound flight when the fuselage tore open. The pilots managed
to get the crippled Boeing 747 back to Honolulu for a landing that
saved the 345 people still aboard.
   The National Transporation Safety Board, which requested the
search, the Federal Aviation Administration, United and Boeing Co.
have agreed to share the estimated $300,000 cost of recovering the
door, ABC said.
   ``At this time we intend to pursue getting it,'' NTSB spokesman
Ted Lopatkiewicz told The Honolulu Advertiser.
   United spokesman Rob Doughty told the Advertiser the airline is
willing to pay its $70,000 share and had been in contact with the
safety agency.
   David Jimenez, a Boeing spokesman, said Tuesday, ``I think we're
proceeding to recover the door.'' But he said he did not know any
details of the plan or how the Navy would do it.
   NTSB investigators have said the door would help determine what
caused the plane to pop open at 22,000 feet, ripping a 10-by-20-foot
hole in the fuselage.
   In April, a three-day hearing on the accident failed to produce
conclusive evidence of the cause. United executives said then they
wanted to see the door recovered.
   Negotiations were reported to be under way at that time on
whether to retrieve the door and how the costs would be divided.
   Military radar had tracked an object believed to be the cargo
door falling into the ocean at a point where the water is 16,800
feet deep.
   Soon after the mishap, undersea experts said the Navy is probably
the only agency with equipment capable of handling the recovery of
the door.
   A search would probably involve use of a sonar sled and a
remote-controlled vehicle with a camera, Paul Wolcott, a research
submarine pilot at the Hawaii Undersea Research Lab at the
University of Hawaii, said earlier this year.
   The vehicle could probably hook a line to the door to lift it to
the surface, he said.
   The least likely possibility because of the tremendous cost _ up
to $40,000 a day _ would be the Navy's Sea Cliff, one of the world's
few manned research submarines capable of reaching that depth,
Wolcott said.

<HEAD>Witness Incriminates Movie Producer Robert Evans in Radin Killing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A witness testified he was told that movie
producer Robert Evans and a drug dealer paid for the ``Cotton Club''
murder. Evans' lawyer called the accusation an ``outrageous lie.''
   Evans, producer of such films as ``Chinatown'' and ``Marathon
Man,'' has not been charged in the case.
   William Rider, former security chief for Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt, testified Tuesday that defendant William
Molony Mentzer told him about the 1983 slaying of New York
theatrical producer Roy Radin, who had been working with Evans to
finance the film ``The Cotton Club.''
   Mentzer admitted he was one of the killers and named Alex Lamota
Marti as another, Rider testified at a preliminary hearing on murder
charges against Mentzer, Marti and a third defendant, Karen DeLayne
Greenberger.
   ``Did Mr. Mentzer indicate to you that anyone else was involved
in the killing of Mr. Radin?'' asked Deputy District Attorney David
Conn.
   ``Yes,'' said Rider, adding after prodding from Conn, ``Mrs.
Greenberger and Robert Evans.''
   ``Did he say what their involvement was?'' asked Conn.
   ``Yes, essentially that they paid for the contract,'' Rider said.
   Rider said Mentzer had mentioned two reasons why Evans, the
former chief of production at Paramount Pictures, and Mrs.
Greenberger, a reputed drug dealer, would have wanted Radin killed.
   ``One variation was that Mr. Radin was killed because of the
stealing of Mrs. Greenberger's drugs,'' Rider said, ``and the other
version was Mr. Radin tried to cut Mrs. Greenberger out of the movie
deal.''
   ``The Cotton Club'' was being financed in a deal between Radin
and Evans when Radin disappeared. His body was found a month later
in a dry river bed. He had been shot repeatedly in the head.
   ``Anybody who makes a statement that Evans is involved in this
case is telling an outrageous lie. It's absolutely untrue,'' said
Evans' attorney, Robert Shapiro. ``If the state believed it was
true, he'd be a defendant, not a witness.''
   Evans was called as a witness but declined to testify on grounds
his answers might tend to incriminate him.
   The hearing before Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay is to determine
whether there is sufficient evidence for those charged to stand
trial.
   Radin, an obese, cocaine-sniffing impresario from New York's Long
Island, appeared on his way to Hollywood success in 1983, raising
$35 million to finance ``The Cotton Club,'' a movie about a famous
Harlem nightspot.
   He was killed before the deal was completed, and others,
including Evans, ultimately produced the film.

   The early departure of a commuter train
caught some passengers off guard but was even more surprising for
the conductor and engineer, who were still in the station.
   None of the dozen or so passengers on the runaway Metro North
train were hurt in the incident Tuesday, which ended when a
passenger pulled an emergency brake, halting the 96-seat train about
200 feet from the station.
   ``The car wasn't going too fast, maybe 15 miles an hour or so,
but we were going to Bridgeport all right,'' said Jack Comerford, a
passenger.
   Metro North spokesman Dan Brucker said the railroad was
investigating what caused the 7:07 a.m. train to begin rolling at
6:57 a.m. without its engine engaged.
   Investigators were focusing on the electric switch that governs
the brakes, he said.
   ``When the engineer and conductor came out to find their train
missing, they were, we understand, somewhat surprised,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The superpowers held their first full meeting in
the latest round of talks on cutting long-range nuclear arms, but
chances of a breakthrough looked slim after both sides refused to
budge on major issues.
   The Bush administration was expected to propose verification
measures aimed at speeding progress on a treaty with the Soviet
Union.
   It was not clear when or in what detail the U.S. side would
present its proposals. Both sides were observing an official news
blackout in Geneva on the substance of the talks.
   On Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a pact to
cut each side's long-range nuclear forces is part of ``the next
phase'' in disarmament.
   ``The basis for this already exists, and the oustanding questions
are not insurmountable as far as we are concerned if the two parties
make the necessary efforts,'' Gorbachev said in a message carried by
the official Tass news agency.
   The two new chief arms negotiators, Richard Burt and Yuri
Nazarkin, led their delegations in the first full meeting of the
11th round of talks, a 2{-hour session at the U.S. mission. Talks
began in March 1985.
   The negotiations are on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
intended to cut long-range nuclear forces, and space and defense
issues. The talks are aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range
bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   This round, due to last about six weeks, began Monday with a
meeting of the two delegation heads.
   Both Burt and Nazarkin made plain that their public positions
remain unchanged on several major issues, including mobile nuclear
missiles.
   On Tuesday, President Bush suggested he might back away from U.S.
insistence on banning these weapons if Congress approves a plan for
upgrading U.S. strategic forces, according to congressional leaders
who met with him.
   The plan would include funding for both the 10-warhead MX and the
single-warhead Midgetman missiles.
   Two other disputes center on U.S. plans for space-based missile
defenses and whether to include long-range sea-launched cruise
missiles in START.
   Under a U.S. anti-cheating plan outlined by Bush on Monday, both
sides would begin tackling the tricky problem of verification early
by testing monitoring procedures during the talks, rather than
waiting until the treaty is completed.
   The Washington Post quoted an unidentified official in Washington
as saying such trial inspections would involve round-the-clock
monitoring of some ballistic missile factories and on-site checks of
missile warheads. The proposal also was reported to include a ban on
some missile flight tests.

   A minister is spending a month on
orders from a judge in the rat- and roach-infested apartment he
rented to a disabled man and his 6-year-old quadriplegic daughter.
   Rats at the apartment rented out by Eugene Sacus ``were breaking
open food boxes. The little girl is not even physically able to
brush them off herself,'' said Sue Thompson, city housing
inspections director.
   A social worker said the girl had gotten sick from being bitten
by roaches.
   Sacus, pastor of the Pentecostal Deliverance Church of Apostolic
Faith, reported to the apartment Tuesday, one day after the tenants
were given other housing, Thompson said.
   Sacus was arraigned on housing code violations Friday. Judge Joel
P. Hoekstra ordered him to live in the apartment for 30 days, during
which time he must bring the place into compliance, said Paula
VanderMeulen, a probation officer.
   VanderMeulen said Sacus will wear an electronic tether to make
sure he stays at the house.
   ``So far, he's acting as though it's no big deal,'' she said
Tuesday. ``Whether he updates the property is the big question.''
   Sacus did not return messages left on his answering machine.
   Sacus was cited two years ago for 15 housing code violations
involving the property, paid $370 in fines and cost and was ordered
to make repairs. Thompson said he never made the repairs.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Iranian Parliament Speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani discussed prospects for settling conflicts in the
Middle East and Afghanistan in the first of two meetings between the
leaders, Tass said.
   The Soviet president on Tuesday warmly greeted Rafsanjani, the
highest Iranian official to visit Moscow since the 1979 Iranian
revolution, and met with him again today.
   The official Soviet news agency said Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati was meeting with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet
foreign minister.
   Asked about possible arms sales to Iran, military chief of staff
Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev told a news conference that Gorbachev and
Rafsanjani would be meeting and said any decision would be made by
``the political leadership.''
   On Tuesday, Gorbachev warmly greeted Rafsanjani to Moscow and
promised that the Kremlin will not damage Tehran's interests.
Rafsanjani said Gorbachev's reforms and Iran's strength will help
improve relations, Tass said.
   The Soviet leader said although relations between the neighboring
countries have not always fared well, ``there cannot be and will not
be anything in our policy now that would damage Iran's interests.''
   The leaders discussed prospects for settling conflicts in the
Middle East and Afghanistan, and their attitudes toward other
countries, Tass said.
   Rafsanjani, who before leaving Tehran recalled that Russian
empires always had coveted Iran, was reported to have listed areas
of agreement between the two nations. They included universal
disarmament, the question of foreign military in the Indian Ocean, a
neutral Afghanistan and national self-determination as areas where
the two could come very close.
   Rafsanjani expressed hope before he left home that the visit will
open ``a new chapter in Iranian-Soviet relations and in the history
of the region,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   Tass said earlier: ``In the Soviet Union there is confidence that
the visit by Rafsanjani will give fresh impetus to the continued
progress of Soviet-Iranian relations ... and will help improve
mutual understanding and strengthen cooperation between the two
countries.''
   His delegation included Velayati and Mohsen Rezaie, commander of
Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
   Rafsanjani also is acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armed
forces.
   Economics Minister Mohammad Javad Iravani preceded Rafsanjani to
Moscow to prepare economic and commercial agreements, the Iranian
agency reported.
   Iran officially has a non-aligned foreign policy, but Rafsanjani
said earlier this month that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had
instructed him to improve relations with Moscow. Khomeini died on
June 3.
   With ties to the West strained, Tehran is looking to the Soviet
bloc for help in rebuilding Iran after its eight-year war with Iraq.
   Relations between Tehran and Moscow soured soon after the 1979
Iranian revolution. That December, Soviet troops deployed to help
the Afghan government fight Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas, and
Iran in 1981 repressed the Tudeh Communist Party.
   The Soviet Union was one of Iraq's major arms suppliers in the
Iran-Iraq war, which ended with an August 1988 cease-fire.
   Soviet-Iran relations improved when Soviet troops withdrew from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15.

   The Marines will storm Duluth this summer
after all.
   The Navy on Tuesday accepted the city's invitation to reschedule
a mock beach assault that was canceled after peace activists and
others opposed it.
   The City Council, after hearing from peace activists and veterans
Monday night, voted 6-3 to extend the invitation.
   ``If the City Council is willing to brave the demonstrators, so
will we,'' said Lt. Commander Luanne Smith, executive officer of the
Navy Recruiting District in Minneapolis.
   Earlier this month, religious and peace groups and City Council
President Joyce Benson got the Navy to cancel the public relations
show set for July 21. Many complained that it would glorify war and
damage the Lake Superior beach.
   The exercise involving 200 Marines was to be part of a recruiting
and goodwill visit.
   Kathy Anderson of Duluth Clergy &amp; Laity Concerned said peace
activists will demonstrate against the landing next month.
   Pat Olson, adjutant of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 137,
countered, ``For every one of those carrying a sign, there'll be two
of us.''

described as a model soldier, could receive a life sentence.
   Peri, 21, initially pleaded innocent to the espionage charges. He
changed his plea today when his court martial began, said Maj.
Samuel Taylor, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's 5th Corps.
   Taylor said Peri also pleaded guilty to violating regulations
banning travel by U.S. military close to the East German border
area; being absent without leave; and failing to obey regulations
requiring him to obtain permission to travel to East Germany.
   Taylor said prosecutors dropped a charge of removing classified
information because Peri pleaded guilty to espionage.
   On Feb. 21, Peri disappeared from his unit in Fulda, near the
East German border, taking a portable computer from the office where
he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist.
   He turned himself in 11 days later.
   On March 16, the Army's 5th Corps in Frankfurt said Peri had been
indicted for espionage for allegedly giving East Germany secret NATO
plans for protecting West Germany in the event of an attack.
   It said the East Germans notified U.S. officials that Peri made
contact with them.
   Peri is assigned to the U.S. Army's 11th Cavalry Regiment in
Fulda, about 60 miles northeast of Frankfurt. The unit is
responsible for front-line patrols along West Germany's border with
East Germany.
   Peri had been kept in investigative custody at the U.S. Army's
confinement facility in Mannheim before the court-martial started.
   Peri, neatly dressed in a U.S. Army uniform, walked with his head
bowed into the U.S. Army Community Center building. The young
soldier was not handcuffed but was escorted by military police.
   The judge, Col. Craig C. Jacobson, ordered the public out of the
courtroom while specifics of the secret information Peri allegedly
gave to the East Germans were discussed by the court.
   Taylor said a board of military officers would be selected
Thursday to hear testimony that will help determine the length of
Peri's sentence.

<HEAD>Times Says Home Mortgage Insurer's Reserves May Disappear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An audit of the Federal Housing Administration is
expected to show that its main mortgage insurance fund has been
suffering losses at a rate that could run it dry in five months, The
New York Times said today.
   The newspaper, citing government investigators and private
auditors, said the findings will be contained in the first full
audit of the 55-year-old agency, which insures $275 billion worth of
U.S. home mortgages.
   It cited agency officials as saying the FHA was down to a
five-month reserve, $2.8 billion, to cover holders of defaulted
mortgages.
   When the reserve runs out, the Treasury must pick up the payments.
   The main fund is the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which covers
5.5 million mortgages of up to $101,000 each on single-family homes.
The insurance is financed largely by premiums paid by home buyers.
   Claims on the fund amounted to $2.9 billion in 1986, $4.4 billion
in 1988 and will hit an estimated $6.6 billion this year, according
to budget documents cited by the Times.
   It said that a General Accounting Office report last month put
FHA's losses for the year ending September 1988 at $452 million and
that preliminary figures for the following six months indicated an
additional $150 million in losses.
   Economic downturns, particularly in the oil industry in the
Southwest, plus fraud, mismanagement and a sluggish housing market
contributed to the agency's problems, the Times said.
   Senior officials of the FHA's parent organization, the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, speaking anonymously, said the two
consecutive years of losses did not pose a serious threat, the Times
said.
   But a private auditor said he was less optimistic, particularly
if there were a recession.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Warns Against `War' Among Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has been
denounced as a traitor by ultra-nationalist Jewish settlers, urged
Israelis not to battle among themselves over how to end the
Palestinian uprising.
   Shamir also endorsed a proposal to include Jewish settlers in
army defense units in the occupied lands despite a recent rise in
settler attacks on Palestinians.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, meanwhile, assailants shot and
killed taxi driver Hassan Sharoub, a 47-year-old Palestinian who was
suspected of cooperating with Israel, radio reports and Arab
journalists said.
   An army official confirmed a fatal shooting in Nablus and said
the circumstances were under investigation.
   Sharoub's death brought to 527 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 18{-month uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and
occupied Gaza Strip. The figure includes 64 suspected collaborators.
Twenty-three Israelis also have died.
   Israeli newspapers reported today that Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin has asked Israeli experts to examine the legality of using
harsher measures against Palestinians.
   Rabin reportedly wants to deport Palestinians within a week after
such an order has been issued. Deportees now can appeal the order
and the legal procedure can take months.
   Rabin also wants to scrap the possibility of appealing
army-ordered house demolitions, the Davar newspaper reported.
   The army sometimes destroys or seals the homes of Palestinians
suspected of attacks on Israelis. The United States has condemned
the practice, saying it denies suspects due process of law because
the army usually acts before a suspect has been tried.
   Shamir has come under growing pressure from the extreme right to
use harsher measures to quell the uprising. His critics also argue
that his peace plan, based on elections in the occupied lands, will
pave the way for a Palestinian state.
   On Tuesday, settlers shouted down Shamir as he spoke at the
funeral of a U.S.-born West Bank settler allegedly slain by
Palestinians.
   Shamir said on Israel radio today that disagreements over
government policies must not degenerate into domestic strife. ``We
must do everything to make sure such a war never happens. This is
the most dangerous thing,'' Shamir said.
   ``I would suggest to everyone to lower the profile of our
internal debates, because if the profile rises you can slide into
irresponsible actions,'' he added.
   Shamir's rival in the Likud bloc, ultra-nationalist Industry
Minister Ariel Sharon, was met by thunderous applause during
Tuesday's funeral. Sharon has engineered a showdown with Shamir over
the peace plan at a Likud convention next month.
   A poll published by the Yediot Ahronot daily Wednesday indicated
Shamir had the support of 55 percent of the 2,600 members of the
party's Central Committee. Twenty-one percent opposed it and 24
percent were undecided, the poll said.
   In an apparent bid to appease the settlers, Shamir said he backed
a proposal to include them in regional defense units. ``We can
definitely take this path,'' he said.
   In the past, settlers doing army reserve duty were barred from
serving near their hometowns. Most Israeli men serve in the reserves
for up to two months a year until age 54.
   Shamir also criticized an attack Tuesday in which a 23-year-old
Jewish settler fired at a group of Palestinians standing at an
intersection near Tel Aviv. Two Arabs were wounded, one of them
seriously.
   Israel radio said the assailant, who staged the shooting after
attending the funeral of the slain settler, has a police record.
   ``We must prevent such actions. They only strengthen the other
side, the extremists among the Arabs,'' Shamir said.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader Optimistic Convent Will be Removed From Auschwitz</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish leader said today he has received new
assurances that a Roman Catholic convent on the grounds of the
Auschwitz death camp will be finally be moved, ending a 5-year-old
dispute.
   Ernst Ludwig Ehrlich, European director of B'Nai B'rith, said in
a telephone interview that he was confident that the convent would
be located after a conversation with Cardinal Franciszek Macharski,
archbishop of Cracow, Poland, whose diocese includes Auschwitz.
   Under the terms of a 1987 Geneva declaration signed by 18
Catholic and Jewish leaders, Macharski is charged with arranging the
transfer of the convent, founded in 1984.
   Jews have protested the convent, located in a former storehouse
on the Auschwitz camp perimeter, as a Christian symbol that intrudes
on the place that was one of Hitler's busiest extermination camps.
Nazi Germany killed 6 million Jews during World War II.
   The Geneva declaration recognized the special significance of
Auschwitz in the holocaust, and called for the transfer of the
convent's 14 Carmelite nuns within two years.
   When the deadline passed on Feb. 22, there were renewed calls for
removal of the convent.
   There also was considerable opposition among Poland's Catholics
but Ehrlich, a co-signer of the declaration, said that in a June 7
letter Macharski said this opposition was fading. Construction of a
convent 500 yards from the camp would ``most probably'' begin early
next year, the letter said.
   The letter ``makes plain that all preconditions exist now for the
implementation of the accord,'' Ehrlich said. ``I never doubted that
Macharski would stick to the accord but it is a pity that all this
could not be done already two years ago.''
   Macharski said in the letter that ``Jewish impatience ... is
completely understandable'' but that protests only ``provoke adverse
reactions from the population and strengthen it in the blind defense
of the nuns.
   ``It would be sad if this would create a gulf between between
Catholics and Jews in Poland,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Three Executed in Shanghai Train Arson; More Death Sentences Announced</HEAD>

   Shanghai authorities today publicly executed three
men convicted of setting a train on fire during pro-democracy
protests, and more people were sentenced to die in another city for
their roles in the protests.
   The executions were the first announced since the June 3-4
military crackdown that crushed the student-led movement. The three
died one day after Shanghai's highest court rejected their appeals
and just two weeks after their alleged crimes were committed.
   The men were shot to death in front of a crowd, said a spokesman
at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs office. He said he did not know
other details and refused to give his name.
   Death sentences in China usually are carried out by a bullet to
the back of the head. There is no record of a death sentence in
Communist China being overturned on appeal, although they sometimes
are commuted to life in prison.
   The United States and other Western governments had appealed for
clemency for the three, and for eight people in Beijing also given
death sentences in connection with the protests.
   But Shanghai radio, in announcing the court's rejection of the
appeal, said, ``There are no legal reasons for mitigating the
punishment of Xu Guoming, Bian Hanwu and Yan Xuerong.''
   Xu and Yan, who are workers, and Bian, who is unemployed, set
fire to a train June 6 after it ran through a barricade set up by
protesters and killed six people. The three were convicted Thursday.
   In the northeastern city of Jinan, 45 people accused of taking
part in protests were convicted in a mass trial before a crowd of
about 10,000, Beijing radio reported.
   The report said some of the 45 were sentenced to death. Others
received death sentences with a two-year reprieve. At the end of two
years, the sentences could be reduced to life in prison for good
behavior.
   Others were given life in prison or lesser terms according to the
report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. It did not give
a breakdown but said those given death were convicted of ``seriously
endangering public order.''
   An editor at the Jinan Daily, contacted by telephone, said 17 of
the 45 were sentenced to death. He said he did not know if the
figure included those given two-year reprieves. He said the trial
was held Tuesday and no executions had been carried out.
   The stiff sentences came one day after China's supreme court
ordered lower courts to deal swiftly and severely with people
accused of taking part in the protests, which the party is
condemning as counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   In other developments, the government today ordered colleges to
set up new political education programs so students will learn to
``love socialism and love the army'' and accept official
condemnation of the protests.
   New arrests were reported, raising the total reported nationwide
to more than 1,600 since June 4, when the army killed hundreds of
unarmed civilians in Beijing in crushing the student-led movement
for a freer, less corrupt society.
   Authorities at Beijing airport arrested four people who were
involved in the protests and trying to flee, the Beijing Daily said.
It said two were women trying to board a Paris-bound plane under
false names. It did not detail their alleged crimes.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today condemned the
executions as ``totally out of proportion to the crime'' and said
she and Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke discussed steps against
China during a meeting in London.
   Asked if they planned diplomatic or other reprisals against
China, Mrs. Thatcher said without elaboration that this had been
discussed.
   President Bush on Tuesday ordered that U.S. government officials
suspend all high-level contacts with Chinese officials. Washington
also said it would seek to postpone consideration of new loans to
China by international organizations in order to protest the
harshness of the crackdown.
   In Hebei province south of Beijing, officials said they arrested
44 ``ruffians'' who took part in protests in the capital. Among them
were two members of the United Association of Beijing Universities,
the independent student union that led seven weeks of pro-democracy
protests.
   Shanghai officials said 65 people had surrendered there,
including 42 leaders of independent student unions and other illegal
groups. It said they repented and some, after ``seeing the light,''
informed on others.
   The State Education Commission sent a notice to all provincial
and local governments ordering them to arrange ``political
ideological education'' for college students, especially those
graduating this year.
   The order, published in the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily, says the main ``weapon'' in such classes should be a June 9
speech by senior leader Deng Xiaoping that claimed the students were
used by anti-party plotters who sought to establish a Western-style
democracy in China.
   Deng said in the speech that the greatest mistake of his 10 years
in power was a failure of political education of both the students
and the public.
   ``The recent counterrevolutionary rebellion was a very good
lesson,'' the State Education Commission said.

   Charter planes flew hundreds of weary
tourists home today after they were plucked from a Soviet ocean
liner that had crashed into an iceberg, cutting short a pleasure
cruise to the land of the midnight sun.
   Workers plugged the holes on the 630-foot cruise ship Maxim Gorky
and the vessel steamed toward the island of Spitsbergen today,
escorted by two other Soviet vessels, the Soviet news agency Tass
said.
   Maritime experts said the ocean liner, on a cruise to see the
24-hour summer light in the arctic, was moving too fast when it
struck the ice in the Norwegian Sea, 300 miles east of northern
Greenland and 180 miles west of Spitsbergen. No one was seriously
injured.
   Norwegian helicopters flew the aged and most infirm to safety,
but some passengers spent up to seven hours huddled under blankets
in lifeboats until they were picked up. Others waited on ice floes.
   For West German passenger Giesela Rillinger, ``It was six hours
of nothing but ice floes and the sky. If a storm had come up it
would have been all over for us. Six hours of facing death.''
   The Norwegian coast guard ship Senja evacuated 660 passengers _
all but about a dozen West Germans _ and 193 Maxim Gorky crew
members to Longyearbyen, Norway's administrative center on
Spitzbergen island, from where the tourists were flown to
Dusseldorf, West Germany.
   Capt. Marat S. Galimov and 192 other Soviet crew members remained
on the Maxim Gorky, said Sigurd Kleiven, captain of the Senja.
Kleiven said it was Galimov's first voyage in the area.
   Tour leader Winfried Prinz said he was standing on the bridge
next to Galimov when the ship struck the iceberg.
   ``It happened very fast,'' Prinz told a reporter in Dusseldorf.
``We went into the ice field without warning and unexpectedly,
something nobody had counted on. The ship was cruising at normal
speed, about 18 knots, so it wasn't exactly slow, as the collision
shook the ship,'' Prinz said.
   Kleiven said the liner was moving at 18.4 knots when it hit the
ice, tearing a gash 20 feet long and four to six inches wide in the
bow.
   ``I would hardly have sailed faster than two to three knots in
such ice-clogged water,'' Kleiven told reporters on board his coast
guard vessel.
   ``There was fog in the area, and it seems to me as if the Maxim
Gorky may have sped too fast straight into the ice,'' Kleiven said.
   But experienced Norwegian sailors agreed the Maxim Gorky had
sailed too fast in an area often clogged with ice.
   ``Not even the coast guard vessels sail faster than three to five
knots in such waters,'' Guttorm Jacobsen, a skipper who has sailed
the arctic for 40 years, told the Verdens Gang newspaper. ``The
Maxim Gorky must have been too eager to keep its schedule.''
   The newspaper quoted other experts as saying that even if the
captain had seen the ice from a distance of 10 miles it would have
taken his ship up to 45 minutes to stop from a speed of 18 knots.
   The Soviet Embassy in Oslo said the ship today was moving at 4.5
knots toward Spitzbergen, where it would receive emergency repairs.
It was accompanied by a Soviet tugboat and a freighter.
   The ship set out June 11 from Bremerhaven, West Germany, sailed
to Iceland and encountered its difficulties while sailing around the
Spitsbergen archipelago on its way to Norway.
   Maxim Gorky had about 952 people aboard when it struck the ice
early Tuesday while most passengers were partying in a shipboard
nightclub.
   The luxury liner was built in 1969 in West Germany and sold to
the Soviets in 1974.

<HEAD>Left-Wing Coalition Emerges As Kingmaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A left-wing alliance has emerged as power
broker in efforts to build a coalition government, but Greeks girded
for a political crisis and new elections.
   The alleged involvement of leaders of Premier Andreas
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Party in financial scandals was
blamed for its defeat in Sunday's election.
   The conservative New Democracy Party, which finished first, today
sought partners in an interim coalition government dedicated to
investigating the scandals and prosecuting those reponsible. But the
alliance of two communist parties has rejected a New Democracy offer.
   The alliance also refuses to cooperate with Papandreou, making
the possibility of new elections likely and paralyzing Parliament,
which cannot order an inquiry if the political parties cannot form a
government.
   Judicial investigators today asked Parliament to lift the
immunity of two former ministers in the defeated socialist
government _ former deputy premier Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas and
former Public Order Minister George Petsos _ so they can be
prosecuted on bribery charges.
   Under the constitution, ministers only can be prosecuted for
criminal offenses committed while in office if parliament lifts
their immunity.
   Under existing judicial regulations, the evidence against the two
ministers remains secret until presented to Parliament.
   The new Parliament is to convene July 3. There is doubt whether
it will do so because of the inability of Constantine Mitsotakis'
New Democracy, which won 144 of 300 seats in Parliament, to form a
majority government. On Monday, Mitsotakis was given three days to
build a coaltiion.
   Papandreou's party came second with 125 seats and the communist
alliance, which won 29 seats, has become a kingmaker in coalition
talks. The communist alliance also has pushed for investigation of
the financial scandals, and has refused to join a coalition with
Papandreou's party unless he and other party leaders it maintains
are tainted by scandal resign.
   Koutsogiorgas has been accused of allegedly receiving $2 million
from George Koskotas, the owner of the Bank of Crete. Koskotas is
now under arrest in the United States pending the hearing of an
extradition request by the Greek government.
   Koutsogiorgas was dropped from the socialist party's list of
candidates following testimony in March by Yannis Mantzouranis that
Koutsogiorgas received the money for helping pass a bank secrecy law
that blocked investigators from checking into the troubled Bank of
Crete.

<TEXT>
   Florida lawmakers passed a bill making
gun owners subject to prison terms if their firearms are used by
children to shoot someone.
   The Legislature acted after accidental shootings killed three
children since June 5.
   ``We have experienced too many tragedies, and it's time to put an
end to them,'' said Rep. Harry Jennings, a retired Army colonel who
has pushed the proposal for two years.
   The Senate passed the gun-safety bill 26-6 and the House approved
it 71-39 on Tuesday. Gov. Bob Martinez, who was persuaded last week
to include the bill in this week's special session, was expected to
sign the measure.
   Under the bill, gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in
their homes could be charged with a felony carrying up to five years
in prison and a $5,000 fine if children 15 years and younger hurt
someone with the firearms.
   If the child displays the gun in public, the gun owner could be
charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a
$500 fine.
   Exemptions are provided for hunting and target shooting
accidents, shootings involving stolen guns and the guns of law
enforcement officers or military personnel. The law also provides a
seven-day delay before parents of a wounded child can be arrested on
the felony charge.
   Jennings, the bill's sponsor, described it as ``one of the most
important pieces of legislation that we have addressed in years in
this Legislature.''
   His legislation gained national attention after three Florida
children were killed and four wounded in seven accidents earlier
this month.
   The bill requires gun-shop owners to post a sign explaining the
law and to hand out a written warning to customers. The measure also
directs the state Department of Education to prepare a gun-safety
education program that lawmakers can consider next year.
   A lobbyist for the National Rifle Association said the bill was
acceptable.
   ``My job was to try to help produce a bill that had the potential
to do some good and not just run willy-nilly, damaging additional
lives,'' said NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer.
   Rep. Dick Locke led the opponents in the House, which had
approved a similar version during the regular session that ended
June 3.
   ``This bill does not make common sense,'' Locke said. ``You can't
put Mama and Daddy in jail, the kids in a foster home, the court
system is full, the fails are full.''
   Other opponents contended that more children are hurt and killed
in accidents involving cars, pools, fires and household poisons than
guns.
   Accidental gunshots are the fifth-leading cause of death of U.S.
children under age 14, and Florida has one of the three highest
rates of accidental shootings in the country, according to Sen.
Jeanne Malchon, who proposed similar legislation two years ago.
   Last year, 441 Florida children were injured or killed by guns
and another 3,110 were victims of crimes involving firearms.

   Two witnesses testified today that they
saw the man accused of killing Prime Minister Olof Palme outside the
theater where the Swedish leader saw a movie before he was shot.
   The prosecution contends the defendant, Christer Pettersson,
followed Palme from the theater and shot him on Feb. 28, 1986.
   Pettersson, a drug and alcohol abuser with a previous
manslaughter conviction, has maintained he is innocent.
   Roger Ostlund, 40, testified that he went into the theater lobby
to make a telephone call when he saw spotted Pettersson, whom he
knew, outside.
   ``I was just about to call when I saw Christer,'' Ostlund said.
``I leaned out the door and wanted to talk with him, but he made a
rejecting motion and then I thought, something's odd here.''
   Under questioning by defense attorney Arne Liljeros, Ostlund said
he had taken drugs that morning and drank wine in the afternoon. ``I
was a bit tired'' that evening, he said.
   Ostlund said, however, he was ``absolutely sure'' he saw
Pettersson, who has maintained he was not in the area that night.
Ostlund said he knew Pettersson from various prisons where they both
served sentences.
   Another prosecution witness, Pia Engstrom, testified seeing
Ostlund at the theater on the same night she saw Palme and his wife
there.
   Palme's widow, Lisbeth, identified Pettersson in court on Monday
as the man she saw a few feet away immediately after her husband was
shot.
   After today's testimony the trial was adjourned until next week.

<HEAD>Utility Votes to Take Bids to Restart Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The utility that operates the Rancho
Seco nuclear plant is taking bids for a takeover of the power
station that voters decided to close.
   The 3-2 decision Tuesday by the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District to take bids over the next 10 days angered many of the
activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, which
has a history of operating problems.
   The board majority argued that the June 6 ballot measure in which
the electorate decided to close the plant doesn't forbid someone
else from runnning it.
   The sale of Rancho Seco would save the community the $200 million
to $300 million cost of shutting it down, said Joseph Buonaiuto,
board president.
   Voters earlier this month decided in a non-binding referendum to
close the plant, agreeing with opponents' arguments that it is
unsafe and uneconomical, and a majority of the utility board agreed
to abide by the outcome.
   The plant was taken out of service June 7, and so far about 400
contract workers have lost their jobs.
   Sacramentans for Safe Energy, an anti-Rancho Seco group, has said
it will sue to stop the transfer of Rancho Seco to businesses that
might continue to operate it.
   ``We will wait and see what happens in the 10-day period,'' said
Michael Remy, an lawyer with the group. ``Our position still is that
enough is enough.''
   The plant, 25 miles southeast of Sacramento, has operated at 39
percent of capacity over its 15-year life.
   Quadrex, a nuclear power consulting company in Campbell, Calif.,
has said it is interested in taking over the plant.

   An Iranian parliament member today
criticized the foreign ministry's decision to allow the return of
the West German and French ambassadors to Tehran, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Qorban Ali Salemabadi
claimed the two countries led a European attack on Islam and the
late revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The deputy was referring to a decision by 14 Western nations in
February to recall their envoys from Iran in retaliation for a death
sentence issued by Khomeini against British author Salman Rushdie
for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   France and West Germany decided last week to send back their
ambassadors to Iran after the death June 3 of Khomeini, 86. Several
European countries have already sent back their envoys.
   Salemabadi, a deputy from the northeastrn city of Mashhad, called
on the foreign ministry to revise Iran's relations with Paris and
Bonn.
   Also today, IRNA said nearly 180 members of the 270-member
Majlis, or parliament, wrote to committee chairman Ayatollah Ali
Meshkini to express concern over proposed changes in the
constitution that would allow the nation's supreme leader to
dissolve the legislature.
   A committee set up by Khomeini in April to write a new
constitution has proposed widening the leader's powers, the Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
   Iranians are to vote on the new constitution and elect a
president on July 28.
   The lawmakers said Khomeini had not asked the 20-member committee
to review this issue and that the current constitution says the
Majlis should be active under all circumstances.
   IRNA reported the government-run Tehran Times said in an
editorial that ``the late imam believed that the supreme leader was
above the three branches of government.''
   President Ali Khamenei became Iran's highest leader on June 4, a
day after Khomeini, the architect of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution,
died at age 86.
   Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani is the only announced
candidate for president in the July election.
   IRNA also reported today that another government-run newspaper
said in an editorial that Khomeini's will has relevance for ``the
entire oppressed peoples of the world, regardless of their religion
or nationality.''
   Kayhan International said the will should be translated into all
major languages.
   It said the will stresses the importance of self-reliance and
warns of the dangers of adopting foreign cultures, especially
American, according to IRNA.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Bill to Deny Exxon a Cleanup Tax Deduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration today opposed a bill
aimed at denying Exxon Corp. a tax deduction for costs of cleaning
up the Alaska oil spill.
   ``The bill would violate the fundamental principle of business
taxation that a taxpayer's ordinary and necessary business expenses
may be deducted in computing net income,'' Kenneth W. Gideon,
assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, told the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., sponsor of the bill, said: ``I do not
want to tell my constituents that the American people owe Exxon, the
biggest polluter in history, millions of dollars in a tax rebate in
return for destroying the environment and raising prices at the gas
pumps.''
   Waving a handful of Exxon credit cards that irate customers had
mailed him in protest, Reid added:
   ``Given the company's dismal cleanup performance and the
resultant permanent scar that now defaces Alaska's beauty, it is
incomprehensible that Exxon should be able to claim its cleanup
costs _ estimated at $500 million _ as an `ordinary and necessary'
cost of doing business.''
   Some 10 million gallons of crude oil were spilled into Alaska's
Prince William Sound on March 24 when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran
aground.
   A large share of Exxon's cleanup costs apparently are covered by
insurance. Under present law, any uninsured share could be deducted
from taxable income as a cost of doing business. Because the top
corporate tax rate is 34 percent, the effect would be for the
federal treasury to pay 34 percent of the uninsured expenses.
   Reid's bill, which also would apply to any future chemical spill,
would prohibit such a deduction unless the federal government
certified that the cleanup had been conducted in accordance with the
law.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who said he supports the concept of
Reid's bill, pointed out that existing environmental laws contain no
objective standards for determining whether a cleanup was proper.
   Paul R. Huard, vice president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, which opposes the bill, said the legislation likely
would discourage corporate efforts to clean up spills.
   ``Because the sanctions ... are so draconian, a likely response
is that taxpayers involved in oil spills or hazardous substance
dischages will undertake very little cleanup activity on their own
initiative, and instead will choose to protect the deductibility of
their expenditures by awaiting specific directions from the
applicable government agency,'' Huard said.
   The bill was supported by Clifton E. Curtis, executive director
of the Oceanic Society, an environmental group. He said the
legislation should be made tougher by denying ``tax deductions to
spillers for oil or hazardous spill-related expenses without regard
to adequacy of cleanup.''
   ``Such an approach would send a message that would foster
stronger preventive measures by industry,'' Curtis said.
   Rep. William O. Lipinski, D-Ill., who has introduced a companion
bill to Reid's in the House, said Exxon's cleanup expenses should
not be tax-deductible because ``oil and toxic spill cleanup is not
`ordinary' and is not a `necessary' business expense.''

   A teen-ager carried out a seven-year vendetta by
stabbing to death a man who sexually assaulted him and another boy
in 1982, police said.
   Joseph Wolske, 17, surrendered to police before dawn Sunday and
confessed to the 1988 slaying of 67-year-old Jay Petzold, who was
found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, police said. Wolske was
charged with murder.
   The Daily News quoted a police source it did not name as saying
Wolske arrived at Petzold's apartment, asking ``Remember me?''
   The teen-ager then forced his way inside, battered Petzold into
unconsciousness and stabbed him several times, the News said.
   In 1982, Petzold pleaded guilty to sodomizing 10-year-old Wolske
and an 11-year-old friend. The retired transit worker, who admitted
sexually abusing each boy several times in his apartment, was placed
on probation.

<HEAD>Utility Votes to Take Bids to Restart Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The utility that operates the Rancho
Seco nuclear plant is taking bids for a takeover of the power
station that voters decided to close.
   The 3-2 decision Tuesday by the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District to take bids over the next 10 days angered many of the
activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, which
has a history of operating problems.
   The board majority argued that the June 6 ballot measure in which
the electorate decided to close the plant doesn't forbid someone
else from runnning it.
   The sale of Rancho Seco would save the community the $200 million
to $300 million cost of shutting it down, said Joseph Buonaiuto,
board president.
   Voters earlier this month decided in a non-binding referendum to
close the plant, agreeing with opponents' arguments that it is
unsafe and uneconomical, and a majority of the utility board agreed
to abide by the outcome.
   The plant was taken out of service June 7, and so far about 400
contract workers have lost their jobs.
   The vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an
operating reactor.
   Sacramentans for Safe Energy, an anti-Rancho Seco group, has said
it will sue to stop the transfer of Rancho Seco to businesses that
might continue to operate it.
   ``We will wait and see what happens in the 10-day period,'' said

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:
   June 17
   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on the minimum wage bill veto:
   It certainly could have come as no surprise to anyone, the veto
by President Bush of the bill raising the minimum wage.
   President Bush repeatedly had made it clear that he would not
sign legislation increasing the minimum wage beyond $4.25 per hour.
He also insisted that the increase be accompanied by a subminimum
training wage that employers could pay to all newly employed workers
for as long as six months.
   The president maintained that to go any higher on the minimum
wage would cause an unacceptable loss of jobs and add to
inflationary pressure.
   Unless Congress and Bush can come to some agreement, the end
result will be that there will be no increase of any kind in the
minimum wage this year. ``The working poor will be denied any
increase at all because some people want to score a political
point,'' noted Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   No doubt his political opponents will portray the president as
being insensitive to the needs of the working poor because of the
veto. We don't think the American people will buy such propaganda,
however.
   The president had no choice but to disapprove the minimum wage
bill. He had made his position clear and had to stick with it.

   The Times Record, Brunswick, Maine, on Bush's clean air plan:
   As long as President Reagan sided with industrial polluters,
congressional debate centered upon whether clean air laws should be
enacted.
   But with George Bush supporting clean air legislation,
congressional debate will now center on finding the middle ground
between the administration's program and other, even more stringent
legislative proposals.

   The Sentinel, Keene, N.H., on abuse of the franking privilege:
   Members of Congress have used $1 billion worth of free mailing
privileges in the past 18 years.
   There's nothing improper about members of Congres using the frank
to communicate.
   But last year members of Congress sent out an average of five
pieces of mail for each one received. Clearly, Americans are hearing
from these people a good deal more than is necessary or requested.

   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on the U.S. miliary space
program:
   With little fanfare, another competitor in the space payload
business entered _ or rather, re-entered _ the list against NASA
this past week. ...
   It was the Department of Defense, and its new Titan 4 rocket
provides the military with a payload capacity even larger than that
of the famous shuttle.
   The morning liftoff of this 204-foot workhorse was an encouraging
success. It not only lifted a substantial payload (thought to be a
new early warning satellite) off Cape Canaveral, but removed a huge
worry from the Pentagon's shoulders.
   The explosion of the Challenger three years ago threw the
military space program into disarray; this Titan launch represents
the Pentagon's desire to reduce its dependency on a single type of
craft.

   Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal on firearms and children:
   The lesson is abundantly obvious: Any adult who keeps a firearm
of any kind handy in a home where there are children, even if
they're just frequent visitors, should be sure to keep the weapon
safely away from the reach of little ones.
   Everybody in the family should be carefully taught about handling
pistols or rifles and about proper use of them.
   Young people see so much gunplay on television nowadays that it
becomes rather routine and mundane in their minds. When weapons are
around, children should be taught about the dangers guns pose in
careless or untrained hands. Adults also stand constant reminding
themselves.
   A state legislator from Sarasota (Fla.) re-introduced a bill that
was killed in 1988 and died in committee this year to make the owner
of a gun liable when the weapon is left within the reach of a child
who shoots someone. ...
   Any rational person can imagine the horror facing parents whose
children become cold statistics because of a combination of
youthfulness, guns and adult irresponsibility. Owners of weapons
that kill should bear some of the burden.

   Philadelphia Daily News on hired assassins:
   The Army has a proposal to make it all right to murder those
decreed to be ``terrorists.'' Others, led by our current president,
George the Kind and Gentle Spy, and his drug czar, want the right to
open fire on anyone decreed to be a ``drug trafficker.''
   We elect a government to govern, not to run around killing people
without trial, ceremony or second thought.
   Besides, murder is wrong, just as wrong for a bunch of
``pro-active'' pinheads who claim truth and justice is on their side
as it is for you and me.
   It is especially wrong for a country like ours that claims to be
above official murder, one that believes in trials and freedom and
all the other things that are beautiful about this country.

   The Hemet (Calif.) News on the minimum wage bill veto:
   President Bush's veto of the minimum-wage increase _ which the
House failed to override _ accomplished two things.
   First, it prevented congressional demagogues from destroying
hundreds of thousands of jobs for poor people in the name of
``compassion.'' But more important, it showed the Bush is willing to
unleash one of his office's most powerful weapons. ...
   Was this particular veto justified? Absolutely. By hiking the
minimum wage more than one-third _ to $4.55 an hour _ the
congressional bill would have effectively prevented employers from
hiring many first-time or poorly-prepared workers. Instead of
low-paying jobs, many low-skilled youths from the inner cities would
have found themselves with no jobs at all. ...
   His own proposal would have raised the minimum wage from the
current $3.35 per hour to $4.25, but would have allowed employers to
pay a lower amount during a worker's first six months on the job.
The congressional bill would have restricted the training wage to a
mere 60 days.
   Predictably, the unions' allies on Capitol Hill are denouncing
Bush's veto as anti-worker. But if the president wants to do good
rather than just look good, holding firm on such issues is the best
course for him to take.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on the tax increase proposal:
   Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are determined to
increase the federal tax burden on Americans.
   A House Ways and Means Committee subcommittee approved a measure
last week that would raise the tax that finances unemployment
insurance.
   The additional tax would cost employers $4 per worker annually
beginning in 1992 and is expected to add $10.6 billion to federal
coffers during the next five years.
   People are getting disgusted with national leaders who think they
were elected to devise more ways to spend the public's money.
   Most of us are looking for elected officials to come up with ways
to reduce the tax burden on individual Americans and private
businesses.
   The more Congress taxes, the more Congress spends. That's why our
national debt is expected to reach $2.8 trillion this summer.

   The Peninsula Daily News, Port Angeles, Wash., on El Salvador:
   On ... the last day of a three-day swing through Central America,
Vice President Dan Quayle asked Salvadoran rightists not to do
anything of an embarrassing nature.
   By that, the vice president meant for members of the rightist
Arena Party in San Salvador to abstain from political torture and
killing. Give newly elected President Alfredo Cristiani a chance to
try his ``moderate approach,'' Quayle advised.
   The U.S. assessment of conflicts in El Salvador and other parts
of Central America has never been what people familiar with the
region would call clear-headed. But Quayle's remarks suggest a
complete break with reality.
   Cristiani, a millionaire businessman hand-picked by the extreme
right, is a moderate only in his approach to the U.S. officials who
have a say in sustaining U.S. support for the Salvadoran military.
He is just a new, articulate front man for the same old rightist
coalition of military leaders, wealthy businessmen and landowners.
...
   The same right-wing forces responsible for the campaign of terror
in the early 1980s came back to power with the election of
Cristiani. Expect the same murderous tactics. This is all the Arena
crowd knows.
   It is a tragedy for the Salvadoran people who suffered terribly
through 10 long years of civil war. ...
   Their return also amounts to a defeat of U.S. policies aimed at
cultivating a moderate, centrist government in El Salvador that
could end the war and move the country toward democratic reform.
   That is hard to swallow, no question. But ignoring it, as Quayle
and other U.S. policy makers seem to be doing, will not make it
easier.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on Chinese dissidents:
   While Ambassador James Lilley has said the United States doesn't
want to inflame the situation by posturing, the State Department was
nevertheless straightforwardly vocal ... in flatly stating its
intention to protect Chinese dissidents Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian.
   The United States must not waver in its commitment to this
couple, even if it means letting them stay indefinitely at the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing.
   The importance of that commitment exists on two levels _ one
personal, the other symbolic.
   With several executions already ordered by Chinese officials,
Fang is in grave personal danger, since the ``crime'' he is accused
of is comparable to treason. On a broader scale, since Fang and his
wife are aligned with the aspirations of the student democracy
movement, U.S. treatment of them will also inevitably symbolize its
regard for the movement, as well as its commitment to the ideals of
free expression and democracy.
   Author Orville Schell wrote for The New York Times ..., ``Deng
Xiaoping and Li Peng have begun searching for ways to divert
attention from the carnage they wrought in Tiananmen Square on June
3.'' He was referring to their singling out of Fang as an
``archenemy of the nation.''
   Since that piece was written, the government has moved on, adding
two Western journalists as still more diversions, still more objects
of contempt.
   It is a familiar maneuver for Chinese officials. Now Associated
Press reporter John Pomfret and Voice of America's Beijing bureau
chief, Alan Pessin, have been expelled. Pomfret, who speaks Chinese
and who had done much reporting among student demonstrators, was an
obvious target, as was Pessin, whose organization's broadcasts have
tried to counter the Chinese government's shameful rewriting of
recent history.
   It is vital that the United States make known, through both words
and deeds, that it deplores the mass arrests, the planned
executions, the attempt to rewrite history, the intention to arrest
dissident Fang Lizhi and the expulsion of journalists.

   June 14
   The Register-Herald, Beckley, W.Va., on Chinese dissidents:
   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi is not the first to seek refuge in
an American embassy. Nor is it likely he will be the last.
   Fang is holed up in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. China has issued
official proclamations to stop Fang at all borders and all points of
transportation out of the country. But the dissident need not take
another step.
   The Bush administration has three options, but only one choice.
   Under no circumstance should Fang be handed over to the
authorities, who want Fang's hide for his role in the demonstrations
that led to the violent showdown two weeks ago.
   To spirit Fang out of the country would serve only to provoke the
Chinese government _ provoked enough already because we are giving
Fang sanctuary.
   The only choice is to house Fang indefinitely inside the embassy.
   That would be a form of passive resistance to China's latest
outrage.
   But in making that choice, America would be wise to be prepared
for further outrages.

   The Milwaukee Journal on a healthy start program for infants:
   Children deserve the best possible start in life. That means
their mothers must have adequate prenatal care, a relative luxury
for the thousands of Wisconsin women not fortunate enough to be
covered by insurance yet not needy enough to qualify for Medicaid.
   It is for these women, and their infants less than a year old,
that Wisconsin's Healthy Start program was designed.
   Now legislators seem inclined to expand Healthy Start, to include
women whose family incomes are higher than current ceilings set by
the state. That's not just a compassionate gesture; in the long run,
it would prove cost-effective, too.
   Healthy Start pays all prenatal doctor bills, whatever
prescription costs the woman incurs during pregnancy and all
expenses associated with labor and delivery. In addition, the
program covers the costs of the mother's medical care for 60 days
after delivery and the infant's for a full year.
   Obviously, a baby who is immunized and whose growth and
development are tracked by a doctor will have an edge over one
lacking such attention.
   The benefits of prenatal care may seem murkier but are no less
compelling. The longer a woman delays prenatal visits to a doctor,
the more likely she is to bear a child needing medical attention
because of prematurity, low birth weight or some other complication.
Experts calculate that every $1 spent on prenatal care saves $3.38
that would otherwise have to be spent later on a youngster born with
problems.

   The Indianapolis Star on the lottery and political contributions:
   You'd think that after devoting that much time and attention to
the lottery, state lawmakers would have gotten it right. If they
had, there wouldn't be any wrangling about what they meant and what
they didn't mean.
   Under dispute is a provision in the lottery statute governing
political contributions. It prohibits the lottery commission from
entering into a contract with a person who contributed within the
past three years to a candidate for a statewide office.
   In addition, individual vendors and service contractors may not
contribute to a candidate for three years. ...
   If the legislature had stated its intentions precisely, clearly
and unambiguously there would be no confusion, no need for the
governor to ask the attorney general for a ruling, no need for the
attorney general to make one and no bickering about the nature and
content of the ruling.

   In an unprecedented move, House Republicans
today asked the ethics committee to investigate GOP Rep. Donald E.
Lukens of Ohio, convicted last month of charges stemming from his
sexual relationship with a 16-year-old girl.
   The House Republican Conference, the organization of all GOP
House members, took the action in a closed-door meeting at the
behest of its top leadership, according to a statement issued by
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   Such a request virtually ensures that the ethics panel will open
a formal investigation of Lukens, who was convicted May 30 in
Franklin County, Ohio, of contributing to the unruliness or
delinquency of a minor. He is appealing.
   Michel said the move ``reflects our total commitment to standards
of behavior for members of Congress which reflect honorably on the
institution and the nation. House Republicans will not accept
anything less.''
   He said the GOP will live up to its constitutional obligation to
police its own members ``no matter how distasteful or painful.''
   Despite Michel's comments, the move was seen as a pre-emptive
strike by Republicans and an effort to keep Democrats on the
defensive on the ethics issue, which the GOP has said will be its
main emphasis this year. The ethics committee likely would have
investigated Lukens anyway.
   Lukens spokesman William Jarrell said: ``Congressman Lukens
welcomes a full and open investigation that may once and for all
bring forth the truth about this entire episode. In fact, this will
probably assist in our appeals.''
   Jarrell said Lukens was hampered in court because he was not
permitted to cast doubt on the motives and credibility of the girl
and her mother, who were Lukens' accusers. ``Now we'll be able to
bring forth the background and the motives'' of the two, he said.
   The jury found Lukens guilty of the misdemeanor charge based on
its conclusion that he had sex with the girl at his Columbus
apartment last November. Such a conviction does not automatically
deny Lukens the right to serve in Congress or seek re-election.
   The resolution asking for an investigation of Lukens requests
that the ethics panel, formally called the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, ``determine whether Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens
failed to conduct himself at all times in a manner which reflects
creditably on the House of Representatives.''
   The source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
resolution was passed by a show of hands on a ``substantial''
majority.
   In presenting the resolution, Michel said it was unprecedented
for the conference to call for an ethics probe of one of its own
members.
   And another member of the GOP leadership, Rep. Robert Walker of
Pennsylvania, suggested Democrats might do well to turn the ethics
spotlight on their own bad apples.
   ``We have taken that step of asking for an investigation,''
Walker said. ``I think it's an appropriate kind of step to suggest
that the other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of
tough thing that is involved in what our conference did today.''
   The document notes that House members, ``in order to perform
their constitutional duties, must conduct themselves with
integrity'' and that House rules require conduct which will not
bring disrepute on the institution.
   Lukens, 58 and divorced, has said he planned to fight the
conviction and remain in Congress in the meantime. ``I refuse to
allow the lies and deceit of one delinquent individual to ruin me. I
am now fighting for my life,'' he said in a statement following his
conviction.
   Lukens said in that statement that his accuser had ``fantasies of
`getting even with the establishment.'''
   But the court refused to allow him to bring up evidence he wanted
to present to raise doubts about her reliability, the conservative
lawmaker said.
   Since the conviction, Ohio state GOP chairman Robert Bennett has
said Lukens will not be on the party's ticket in 1990 based on
opposition from local party officials.
   Lukens' Republican House colleagues also have distanced
themselves from him. His conviction has harmed their cause at a time
when they have been seeking to use the ethics issue against
Democrats.
   Lukens is currently in the second term of his second stint in
Congress. He also was in Congress for two terms from 1967 to 1971.

   Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland won election today
as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the fourth-ranking
position in the party leadership.
   Hoyer, 50, the deputy chairman of the caucus for the past 6
months, defeated Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., 165-82, in a closed
meeting of House Democrats. Two votes were cast for others in the
secret balloting.
   The Maryland lawmaker, who first came to Congress in a special
election in 1981, said he wanted to ``revitalize'' the caucus, which
holds meetings of all House Democrats on party policy positions.
   The election was part of an ongoing effort by the Democrats to
restore their leadership ranks in the wake of the ethics inquiries
that led to the resignation of Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the party's chief vote counter.
   Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., succeeded Wright and Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., took Foley's post of majority leader. Hoyer
succeeds Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., who was elected last week
as majority whip.

Genscher came here today with a report to the Bush administration on
the recent visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Bonn.
   Genscher also had on his agenda arms control issues and next
month's economic summit meeting in Paris.
   He saw Secretary of State James A. Baker III at the start of the
day, and was scheduled to call on President Bush, Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney and leading members of Congress.
   In contrast to recent visits, there was no major dispute in U.S.

   Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl struck a deal at the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting in Brussels last month
over short-range nuclear missiles.
   A U.S.-British plan to make the weapons deadlier was postponed
until 1992, which pleased Bonn. Also, Bush agreed to negotiations
with the Soviets on a cutback.
   But the West Germans lost out in a drive to hold those talks
promptly. Negotiations would begin only after NATO and the Warsaw
Pact concluded an agreement to reduce conventional armaments and
troops in Europe.
   Genscher's visit fulfills an invitation extended by Baker at the

<HEAD>Massachusetts Porn Law Challenge Sent Back to State Courts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anticipated Supreme Court showdown over
state child pornography laws fizzled today when the justices, in
splintered voting, sent a Massachusetts case back to that state's
courts.
   The court told the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to decide
whether a since-amended state law can be used to prosecute Douglas
Oakes, 40, of Holden, Mass., for ``soliciting a child to pose ... in
a state of nudity ... for pornographic purposes.''
   Today's ruling is a setback for Oakes, who had been freed from
any criminal liability by the state's highest court.
   Oakes was criminally convicted in Worcester County. Prosecutors
said that in 1984 he induced his 14-year-old stepdaughter to pose
for photographs while clothed only in bikini underpants and a scarf.
   Police were contacted after the girl's mother discovered the
photos.
   Oakes was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and was paroled after
two years.
   The state's highest court threw out Oakes' conviction and
dismissed the criminal indictment against him. The state court said
the 1982 law under which Oakes was prosecuted was too broad, and
criminalized ``conduct that virtually every person would regard as
lawful.''
   ``For example,'' the state court said in its ruling, ``(the law)
makes a criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his
or her naked 1-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading
pool.''
   The law later was amended to add a ``lascivious intent''
requirement.
   Today's decision was accompanied by three written opinions but no
majority opinion attracting at least five justices.
   Four of the court's members, led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
said the issue of whether the original Massachusetts law was
overbroad became moot when it was amended.
   Two justices _ Antonin Scalia and Harry A. Blackmun _ voted to
reverse the Massachusetts court and rule that Oakes' prosecution was
constitutional.
   ``Perhaps I am wrong in my estimation of how frequently the
posings prohibited by (the old law) are done for artistic purposes,
or for family photographs, or in some other legitimate and
constitutionally protected context I have not envisioned,'' Scalia
wrote in an opinion joined by Blackmun.
   ``We can deal with such a situation in the unlikely event some
prosecutor brings an indictment,'' he said.
   Three justices _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John
Paul Stevens _ said the court should uphold the state court decision
and rule that the original child-porn law violated free-speech
rights.
   Writing for the three, Brennan noted that the American Sunbathing
Association, a nudist group, told the court that photographs taken
of its 30,000 members in the United States and Canada could lead to
prosecutions under the old Massachusetts law.
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Oakes, 87-1651.

   The Supreme Court today limited the power of
states to outlaw the desecration or destruction of the American flag.
   The justices, voting 5-4, threw out the conviction of a protester
sentenced to a year in jail and fined $2,000 for burning the flag in
Texas.
   In another case, the court limited states' power to punish the
news media for printing truthful, legally obtained information. It
threw out a $97,500 award against a newspaper won by a rape victim
whose name it published.
   The court said a flag-burning at a demonstration in Dallas during
the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of expression
protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said, ``If
there is a bedrock principle underlying the 1st Amendment, it is
that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or
disagreeable.''
   ``We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for
in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem
represents.''
   Joining Brennan were Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens.
   Rehnquist, in an opinion joined by White and O'Connor, said the
flag is a unique national symbol and deserves unique protection.
   ``The government may conscript men into the armed forces where
they must fight and perhaps die for the flag,'' Rehnquist said.
``But (because of today's ruling) the government may not prohibit
the public burning of the banner under which they fight.''
   Today's ruling might permit states to outlaw flag burning in some
cases. For example, a flag burning that led to a riot could still be
illegal. Brennan said Texas already has a law banning conduct that
leads to breaches of the peace, and that is not affected by today's
ruling.
   But Brennan said it violates constitutional free-speech
guarantees to ban flag burning at political rallies or protests
merely because the destruction of the flag offends some people or
because the state wishes to preserve the flag as a symbol of
national unity.
   During the height of U.S. involvement in the fighting in Vietnam,
draft-card burning and falg-burning were common forms of protest.
   In a separate dissenting opinion, Stevens said, ``sanctioning the
public desecration of the flag will tarnsh its value _ both for
those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who
desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.''
   In an unusual move, both Stevens and Brennan read extensively
from their opinions in the crowded courtroom today. Normally,
justices only give brief summations of opinions at most when the
rulings are announced.
   At the center of today's case is Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson of New
York City, a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade.
   He was arrested in Dallas in 1984 following a protest that ended
in front of city hall with demonstrators pouring lighter fluid on
and igniting an American flag authorities said was taken from a pole
outside a bank building. The protesters chanted, ``America, the red,
white and blue, we spit on you.''
   Police said the demonstrators also overturned potted plants and
spray-painted buildings during a destructive march through the city.
   But the only crminal charge was against Johnson for violating a
state law that forbids ``the desecration of a venerated object'' if
that is likely to cause ``serious offense.''
   Police officers who arrested Johnson said they were seriously
offended by the flag burning. Also, an employee of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers said he was so upset that he collected the
charred fragments of the flag and later buried them in his backyard.
   Johnson denied he actually doused or ignited the flag, but said
he approved the action and gave speeches during the rally. He said
he was singled out for prosecution because Dallas police knew he was
a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade.
   Johnson's jury conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals which said the flag burning was a form of symbolic
speech protected by the Constitution.
   The appeals court did not overturn the law itself, leaving open
the possibility that flag burning in some cases would not be a form
of speech and could be prosecuted.
   Many states and the federal government have laws against
desecrating the flag. But their enforcement is spotty.
   The Supreme Court in 1943 ruled that the government may not
compel citizens to salute the flag. The justices in 1974 threw out
the conviction of a college student who taped a peace symbol onto a
flag.
   But the high court previously had not ruled on whether outlawing
the desecration or destruction of the flag violates the Constitution.
   Civil libertarians and some famous artists rallied to Johnson's
support. While not backing his political views, they said laws like
the one in Texas could permit prosecutors arbitrarily to decide what
is permissible dissent. Some said, for example, the law could be
used to outlaw the burning of a flag in a movie about anti-war
protests.
   Veterans groups and conservative organizations that supported the
Texas law said the government should be allowed to ban destructive
conduct that threatens the flag as a symbol of national unity.
   In the newspaper case, the court voted 6-3 to throw out the award
won by a rape victim from a Florida weekly newspaper, saying it
violated free-press rights protected by the Constitution's First
Amendment.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that a federal law allowing public scrutiny of
governmental advisory groups does not apply to the American Bar
Association's role in picking federal judges.
   Voting 8-0, the justices allowed the ABA's deliberations to
remain largely secret.
   _ Sent back to Massachusetts courts a case involving state child
pornography laws.
   The court told the state's Supreme Judicial Court to decide
whether a since-amended state law can be used to prosecute Douglas
Oakes, 40, of Holden, Mass., for ``soliciting a child to pose ... in
a state of nudity ... for pornographic purposes.''
   The ruling is a setback for Oakes, who had been freed from any
criminal liability by the state's highest court.
   The flag-burning case is Texas vs. Johnson, 88-155.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that a federal
law allowing public scrutiny of governmental advisory groups does
not apply to the American Bar Association's role in picking federal
judges.
   Voting 8-0, the justices allowed the ABA's deliberations to
remain largely secret.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in his opinion for the court, said
Congress did not intend the ABA's confidential relationship with the
Justice Department in selecting judges to be made public when it
passed a law covering adivisory committees.
   Tipping the balance in favor of confidentiality, Brennan said, is
the risk that public disclosure of ABA deliberations would infringe
improperly on the president's power to nominate federal judges.
   But Brennan stopped short of declaring that the constitutional
doctrine of separation of powers between Congress and the president
guarantees the confidentiality of the deliberations.
   Today's ruling upheld a federal judge's decision last year
barring application of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the
ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.
   The ABA, the nation's largest lawyers' organization, has for some
40 years played a key role in advising presidents on nominees to the
federal bench.
   The Justice Department asks the ABA's judiciary committee for
confidential evaluations of possible judicial nominees. The panel is
the only non-government group that routinely is told of potential
nominees before the names are made public.
   ABA evaluations are made public after a nomination is submitted
to the Senate _ although the substance of the deliberations
generally remains secret.
   The ABA, after interviewing lawyers, judges, professors and the
nominee, rates potential nominees as exceptionally well qualified,
well qualified, qualified or not qualified. The ABA is not required
to reveal who was interviewed or any specifics of the process.
   A controversy over the ABA's role was ignited when the ABA panel
was divided over former President Ronald Reagan's nomination of
Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987.
   Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee accused ABA
committee members of being politicallly motivated in questioning
Bork's fitness to be a justice.
   The Senate defeated Bork's nomination after a long, bittr fight
in which opponents said he was too rigidly conservative.
   The conservative Washington Legal Foundation and Public Citizen,
a liberal public-interest organization, joined forces in seeking to
compel the ABA committee to reveal its deliberations.
   The former Reagan administration opposed the move. The Justice
Department last year said the Federal Advisory Committee Act is
aimed at special groups and the ABA panel does not fit into that
category.
   Justice Antonin Scalia did not take part in today's ruling.
   The cases are Public Citizen vs. Justice Department, 88-429, and
Washington Legal Foundation vs. Justice Department, 88-494.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from
publication of a rape victim's name, today limited the power of
states to punish the news media for reporting truthful, lawfully
obtained information.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court threw out a $97,500 award against a
Florida weekly newspaper won by a rape victim whose identify was
included in a published report about the crime.
   The justices said the award violates free-press rights protected
by the Constitution's First Amendment.
   Florida law makes it a crime to ``print, publish or broadcast''
the names of victims of sexual offenses.
   ``Our holding today is limited,'' Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote
for the court.
   ``We do not hold that truthful publication is automatically
constitutionally protected, or that there is no zone of privacy
within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by
the press,'' he said.
   The decision also did not preclude the possibility of a state
punishing publication of a sex offense victim's name, Marshall said.
   ``We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful
information which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully
be imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a state
interest of the highest order.''
   That interest was not present in the Florida case, Marshall said.
   The Florida Star, a newspaper that primarily serves the black
community in Jacksonville, could have been put out of business if
forced to pay the award, its lawyers had told the justices.
   The Star obtained the rape victim's name, identified in court
documents only by the initials B.J.F., from a report posted in the
sheriff's department press room in the fall of 1983.
   Most news organizations, including The Florida Star, have
policies against publication of rape victim's names. But publication
of B.J.F.'s name occurred erroneously, the newpaper's lawyers said.
   The victim sued the sheriff and the newspaper. She won $2,500
from the sheriff and $97,500 from the paper.
   In Tallahassee, Fla., Mitch Franks, an assistant deputy state
attorney general, said the attorney general's office will review the
decision when it is received and then make appropriate
recommendations to state lawmakers and prosecutors. He said he was
uncertain of the impact of the decision without seeing the full
opinion.
   ``We would urge, in the interest of protecting the victims of
crime, that the news media continue to adhere to their policy of not
publishing the names of rape victims,'' he said.
   The publisher and editor of the Star were both out of the office
this morning and unavailable for comment, said a newsroom employee.
   In reversing the award, the high court noted its past decisions
on the ``tension between the right which the First Amendment accords
a free press'' and ``the protection which various statutes and
common-law doctrines accord to personal privacy.''
   The court in 1975 barred states from imposing sanctions for the
publication of truthful information contained in official court
records open to public inspection.
   The information in that case also was a rape victim's name.
   A 1977 decision struck down a state law that barred the news
media from publishing the name or photograph of an 11-year-old boy
in connection with a juvenile court proceeding reporters had
attended.
   And in 1979, the court invalidated a state law that made it a
crime for newspapers to publish, withut written approval of a
juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender
_ even if that information were obtained lawfully.
   In today's decision, Marshall noted that the Florida law does not
make it a crime for a private citizen to maliciously spread word of
the identity of a rape victim. The law only targets such
identifications by an ``instrument of mass communication.''
   ``When a state attempts the extraordinary measure of punishing
truthful publication in the name of privacy, it must demonstrate its
commitment to advancing this interest by applying its prohibition
evenhandedly, to the small-time disseminator as well as the media
giant,'' Marshall wrote.
   He added: ``Without more careful and inclusive precautions
against alternative forms of dissemination, we cannot conclude that
Florida's selective ban on publication by the mass media
satisfactorily accomplishes its stated purpose.''
   The state law served as the basis of B.F.J.'s negligence lawsuit.
   Marshall's opinion was joined by Justices William J. Brennan,
Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice
Antonin Scalia concurred in the result.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor and Byron R. White dissented.
   Writing for the three, White said, ``I would find a place to draw
the line higher on the hillside: a spot high enough to protect
B.J.F.'s desire for privacy and peace of mind in the wake of a
horrible personal tragedy.''
   He added: ``There is no public interest in publishing the names,
addresses and phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime
_ and no public interest in immunizing the press from liability in
the rare cases where a state's efforts to protect a victim's privacy
have failed.''
   The case is The Florida Star vs. B.J.F., 87-329.

<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved a one-year ban on
oil exploration in Alaska's Bristol Bay and voted to continue bans
on drilling in areas offshore California, Florida and the
mid-Atlantic.
   The action Tuesday by the House Appropriations subcommittee on
the interior marked a significant expansion of limits on the oil
industry's offshore drilling efforts and reflects political backlash
from the Exxon spill in Alaska last March.
   The ban is attached to a spending bill that will take effect on
Oct. 1. The Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider the
legislation next Tuesday.
   The measure also asks Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to study
options for buying back approximately $95 million in Bristol Bay
development leases sold to oil companies last October.
   The oil industry considers Bristol Bay a prime prospect.
   The panel also recommended continuing for another year existing
bans on drilling in offshore areas in northern and southern
California. Environmental considerations linked to drilling in those
areas is under review by a task force appointed last March by
President Bush. It is due to report to him next January.
   The subcommittee also voted to continue for another year existing
bans on oil drilling in areas off southern Floria, and to withhold
for one year plans for selling exploration leases in a mid-Atlantic
area stretching from Maryland to Rhode Island.
   Lisa Speer, senior staff scientist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group, called the panel's decision
``a real step toward coastal protection.''

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping of China said the
United States used troops to quell student demonstrations during the
1960s and should not criticize China for its crackdown on
dissidents, a Hong Kong newspaper reported.
   The English-language South China Morning Post on Tuesday
published the full speech Deng delivered to senior military
officials on June 9, five days after the army entered Beijing to put
down the pro-democracy movement.
   Portions of the speech, which were broadcast on national Chinese
television, had been reported previously. The newspaper did not say
how it obtained the full text of the speech.
   Deng noted that Washington has criticized China for suppressing
students but said the United States also mobilized troops against
student rioters in the 1960s and 1970s.
   ``They were suppressing students and the people, but we are
quelling counterrevolutionary riots. What qualifications do they
have to criticize us!'' he said.
   In his speech, Deng said the pro-democracy protesters hoped to
``topple the Chinese Communist party and to overthrow the socialist
order ... Of course these slogans are just a front ...Their goal is
to establish a totally Westernized bourgeois republic.''
   Deng said that in the course of quelling the rebellion, many
people died.
   China has maintained that less than 300 people died, about half
of them soldiers. Western intelligence sources and Chinese students
have estimated that up to 3,000 may have been killed in the June 3-4
incident.
   ``No matter how heavy our losses, and in spite of the change of
generations, this army of ours is forever an army under the
leadership of the party, forever the defender of the country,
forever the defender of socialism, forever the defender of public
interest,'' Deng said.
   He indicated in the speech that the student-led protest movement,
which lasted seven weeks, was inevitable.
   ``This storm was bound to come sooner or later ... We are
fortunate that it has come about now, mainly because we have a large
group of senior comrades who are still alive. They have experienced
many storms and they know the cause of effects of things,'' the
84-year-old leader said.
   Deng stressed that the basic concept of reform and openness for
the past 10 years is correct and indicated that China wants to
maintain economic ties to the rest of the world. ``Without reform
and openness, how could we have what we have today?''
   He said the results of the economic reforms that began in 1979
should be carefully assessed. ``We must persist in the coordination
between a planned economy and a market economy. There cannot be any
change in this policy ... What is important is that we should never
change China into a closed country.''
   He urged more investment in China ``even if it involves heavy
debts.''
   However, less than two weeks after Deng's speech, Japanese
Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said it will put a halt to all
economic aid negotiations with China. Japan supplies 80 percent of
the international credit China receives.
   On Tuesday, Washington announced it was tightening diplomatic and
financial pressure on China, including postponing new loans.

   About 300 Soviet troops and 100
military vehicles began leaving Czechoslovakia this week under
Kremlin plans to withdraw 50,000 Soviet troops from eastern Europe
by 1991, a newspaper said Wednesday.
   An engineering batallion began pulling out Tuesday from the
Moravian city of Olomouc, 170 miles east of Prague, according to the
newspaper Lidova Demokracie.
   The vehicles, including army trucks, would be put on five trains
and taken to Byelorussia, in the western Soviet Union, the newspaper
said.
   The first stage of the current pullout was completed March 17
when one airborne batallion left the Slovak city of Zvolen, 240
miles east of Prague.
   In all, 1,500 men, 192 tanks and 20 fighter planes are to leave
Czechoslovakia in 1989.

   A transport plane crashed this week in
southern Afghanistan, killing or injuring 42 passengers and crew, a
Moslem rebel news service reported Wednesday.
   The Afghan News Agency said the Soviet-built An-32 went down
Sunday at Lashkhar Gah, capital of Helmand province bordering
Pakistan.
   There was no independent confirmation.
   ANA did not say whether the plane, normally a civilian aircraft
capable of carrying 39 passengers, belonged to Afghanistan's Ariana
national airline or whether it was in military service.
   The agency said it was not clear whether it crashed due to a
technical problem or was shot down by guerrillas fighting the
country's Soviet-backed Marxist government.
   An Ariana airliner hijacked on a flight from Kabul crashed the
same day in western Iran, killing five people and injuring 33,
according to official reports from both countries.

   Vietnam on Wednesday turned over the
remains of 28 people believed to be American servicemen, and it
plans to give U.S. officials another 16 sets of remains.
   Maj. Dan Trout, a U.S. military spokesman, said a 21-member U.S.
military team received the remains at a ceremony at Hanoi's
international airport. He said it was learned that 16 other sets
would be turned over to the United States, but no date has been set.
   Wednesday's release was the 10th since August 1987, when a senior
delegation to Hanoi obtained promises from the Vietnamese to step up
efforts to resolve the issue of Americans missing in action.
   Vietnam has repeatedly said it hopes to establish diplomatic and
economic ties with the United States. The unresolved MIA issue, as
well as Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, have been major barriers
to this.
   Hanoi has promised to pull all its troops out of Cambodia by the
end of September and has dramatically improved cooperation on the
MIA issue. U.S. military teams have been allowed into the Vietnamese
countryside in joint MIA searches, and the number of turnovers of
remains has increased.
   In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Hanoi, Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach said it was conceivable that
U.S.-Vietnamese links could be forged in 1990.
   Trout said the 28 remains were delivered in wooden boxes,
inspected by a U.S. forensic expert and then transferred to aluminum
caskets. An honor guard saluted as American flags were placed on
each casket. The caskets were loaded onto a C-141 transport
aircraft, which flew them to Hawaii for identification at a U.S.
military laboratory.
   Since August 1987, 212 sets of remains have been turned over, and
56 have been identified as Americans.
   The Defense Department says 2,353 Americans are still listed as
missing in action from the Indochina war.
   Some Americans believe Vietnam is also holding living Americans,
but Hanoi has denied this.
   The United States in the past accused Vietnam of releasing
remains at politically oportune moments. Hanoi, in turn, has accused
Washington of using the MIA issue to punish Vietnam, by linking its
resolution to economic aid and establishment of diplomatic ties.

<HEAD>National Party Leader Begins European Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa's governing party leader, F.W. de
Klerk, began a European tour Wednesday, the highest-ranking South
African to visit since President P.W. Botha came in 1984.
   Forty members of the opposition Labor Party signed a motion in
the House of Commons urging Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher not to
see de Klerk, who is expected to become South Africa's president in
September.
   They described the visit as ``unwelcome, untimely and damaging to
the prospects of dismantling apartheid in South Africa and
establishing peace in southern Africa.''
   De Klerk became head of the National Party in February, shortly
after Botha suffered a stroke.
   Botha, the head of government since 1978, has indicated he will
step down as president after parliamentary elections in September.
The National Party, which is virtually certain to win the polls,
designated de Klerk as Botha's successor.
   De Klerk said at Heathrow Airport he looked forward to meeting
Mrs. Thatcher, the West's most outspoken opponent of imposing tough
sanctions on South Africa.
   This year, after visiting two of South Africa's neighboring black
states, Zimbabwe and Malawi, Mrs. Thatcher pledged to increase
contact with South African leaders. She said that is the best way of
pressing for an end to apartheid and the release of black leader
Nelson Mandela.
   Asked if he thought Mrs. Thatcher could help end South Africa's
isolation, de Klerk said, ``I don't want to comment on her specific
role.''
   ``She has always taken a principled stand from her viewpoint and
we don't want to misuse her in any sense of the word whatsoever,''
de Klerk added.
   ``Basically, the state of relations between Britain and South
Africa has always been good and we hope that it will remain so _ and
obviously we hope that it will improve.''
   De Klerk also will go to West Germany, Italy, Portugal and
Switzerland.
   He will meet West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on
Thursday and then return to London for talks with Mrs. Thatcher on
Friday.
   De Klerk is the highest-ranking South African official to visit
Britain since Botha came five years ago. During that visit, Botha
declared that ``apartheid is dead.''
   He returned home to install a new constitution that ensured
continued rule by the white minority.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet arms delegates on Wednesday held
the first full meeting in a new round of negotiations to cut each
side's long-range nuclear arsenals by up to half.
   The Bush administration was expected to propose verification
measures aimed at speeding progress on a treaty with the Soviet
Union, but it was not clear when or in what detail the U.S. side
presented its proposals. Both sides were observing an official news
blackout in Geneva on the substance of the talks.
   Soviet spokesman Alexander Melnik suggested it was too early to
say where the round is headed.
   Bush on Monday proposed that the United States and Soviet Union
should begin testing verification procedures during negotiations on
reducing long-range nuclear forces, rather than waiting until a pact
is completed.
   The new chief Soviet arms negotiator, Yuri Nazarkin, said he
would wait for formal submission of the proposal before commenting.
   On Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a treaty
reducing each side's long-range, or strategic, forces is part of
``the next phase'' in disarmament.
   ``The basis for this already exists, and the oustanding questions
are not insurmountable as far as we are concerned, if the two
parties make the necessary efforts,'' Gorbachev said.
   Nazarkin and the new U.S. chief envoy, Richard Burt, led their
delegations in the first plenary session of the 11th round of talks,
a 2{-hour session at the U.S. mission. The Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks began in March 1985.
   No date was announced for the next session.
   The round, due to last about six weeks, began Monday with a
meeting of the two delegation heads.
   Rapid progress in the talks appears unlikely, since both sides
have opposing positions on at least three major issues: the U.S.
plan for space-based missile defenses, the long-range sea-launched
cruise missiles and the mobile intercontinental missiles.
   Along with efforts on an arms treaty, negotiations are also
resuming on space and defense.
   The Soviets want to link agreements in the two areas, but
Washington has refused.
   Under the Bush plan, both sides would begin tackling the tricky
problem of verification early by testing on-site monitoring
procedures during the talks, rather than after the treaty is
finished.
   The talks aim at a treaty reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range
bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   Many parts of the draft text have been agreed, including lower
ceilings of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _
missiles and bombers _ for each side.

   Communist China has always had difficulty
persuading its students and scholars to return home from abroad to
an uncertain economic, academic or personal future.
   Now, after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement, it may
be impossible.
   The result could be a continuing and damaging brain drain for a
nation whose leaders have been trying to bring it fully up to modern
standards.
   Since the June 3-4 military crackdown in Beijing, the major host
countries for Chinese students have announced that Chinese may
extend their stays.
   The United States, home to half of the 80,000 Chinese studying
abroad, says they can stay at least another year. Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney told the nation's 4,000 Chinese students
they can stay until the situation in their country stabilizes.
   Britain is extending visas for its 3,500 Chinese students, as are
New Zealand, West Germany, Japan and France. Australia says nearly
all of the 10,000 students there have inquired about prolonging
their stay.
   ``I would say that all of them will stay if possible,'' said Tian
Kun, a former University of Maryland student who returned to China
after obtaining U.S. citizenship.
   Before June, most gave up their motherland because of economic
reasons. Chinese scientists or engineers who could command high
salaries in the United States had little incentive to return to
China for jobs that pay less than 200 yuan ($54) a month.
   The newspaper Economic Information recently acknowledged many
stay away because of a lack of suitable jobs in China and a rigid
seniority system that stifles their talents. Many also fear they
never will be permitted to go abroad again, it said.
   Many fear the more threatening prospect of being drawn into the
vortex of political repression. Thousands of Chinese abroad marched
in demonstrations or expressed sympathy for the democratic goals of
the students in Tiananmen Square. Many face certain repercussions _
from political indoctrination to jail _ if they return.
   ``If China becomes a democratic country, I will go back,'' said
Qian Songnian, a physicist at Dartmouth College. ``But in this
situation, certainly not.''
   The Chinese government, which began sending students abroad a
decade ago under senior leader Deng Xiaoping's open-door policy, has
generally shrugged off the brain-drain problem.
   The government says about 90 percent of the 35,000 state-funded
students aboard will come home. Many have little choice. The United
States and other countries have ensured that students do not
overstay their visas, and students usually are forced to leave their
families behind in China.
   The government has far less control over private students _
usually younger and more independent _ who receive scholarships or
financial support from overseas relatives.
   ``Many private students will try to transfer to Canadian schools
after their American visas expire,'' Miss Tian said. ``They will
think of everything they can'' to avoid coming back.
   China so far has shown no signs of stopping its foreign studies
programs, partly because the children of senior leaders are among
the beneficiaries. Senior leader Deng and Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang are two of the many officials whose children
have studied abroad.
   China, however, has tried to tighten controls by limiting
scholarships to older, postgraduate students with greater job and
family ties at home. Last year, universities sent only 600 students
abroad, while 4,000 went from research centers and institutes.
Almost all are in engineering, science and other applied fields.
   ``It is the students' unshirkable duty and responsibility to come
back on schedule to serve the country when they have finished their
studies,'' educator Huang Xinbai said last year.
   But for the hundreds of young people whose visions of a freer
China were shattered by the tanks rolling into Tiananmen Square,
thoughts are mainly of escape.
   ``I'm just trying to leave the country,'' said one Beijing
University student. ``For more than 2,000 years, Chinese have put up
with governments like this. It will take a long time to change.''

   President Bush will veto major child-care
legislation being advanced by Senate Democrats and a Republican if
it reaches the White House in its present form, the administration
said today.
   A letter from the Office of Management and Budget distributed on
Capitol Hill said the multibillion-dollar package before the Senate
``violates all of the president's principles.''
   The letter said the revised measure before the Senate was an
improvement over the original bill but remained ``fundamentally
flawed.'' It said the measure would restrict parental choice in
child care, provide assistance only to families who pay for child
care and discriminate against low-income parents who have other
family members care for their children.
   The White House is backing an alternative Republican package. The
OMB letter said that if the plan favored by the Senate's Democratic
leadership ``were presented to the president, his senior advisers
would recommend that he veto it.''
   The statement was distributed as Senate GOP leaders sought
support for the alternative. Debate on the issue continued in the
Senate today, but no votes were scheduled until Thursday.
   The criticisms in the OMB letter were similar to those raised by
many Republicans during the Senate's five days of debate on the
issue. The points prompted Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who
co-sponsored the Democratic bill, to lash out at his GOP colleagues.
   ``I'm ashamed when I hear some of the arguments that I've heard
on this floor,'' Hatch said Tuesday, accusing critics of spreading
``misinformation and disinformation and distortions.''
   ``I have no respect for people who distort the facts,'' Hatch
said. ``We have an obligation to tell the truth and let the chips
fall as they may.''
   Hatch, who has been critical of the Bush administration's
competing child care proposal, said he believed provisions of the
president's tax-credit package could be merged with the revised Act
for Better Child Care sponsored by Hatch and Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.
   ``This should not be a partisan political issue,'' Hatch said.
``We're willing to do what it takes to get a child care bill and we
don't care who gets the credit for it.''
   Republican leader Bob Dole had planned to offer a White
House-backed alternative to the ABC plan on Tuesday but held off as
the GOP leadership sought support from Southern Democrats.
   It relies almost exclusively on tax credits, including an
expansion of the existing earned income tax credit for low-income
families with children under the age of 5. Like the Dodd-Hatch
proposal, the Dole alternative would provide up-front money to
families that otherwise could not take advantage of the existing
dependent care tax credit because of low income.
   Dole also called for a $400 million block grant program states
could use to fund programs designed to improve the quality and
quantity of child care. And, borrowing a proposal from Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., Dole proposed exempting child care earnings from
the outside income limitations faced by Social Security recipients.
   Dole and other Republicans have touched on their plan during the
four days of Senate debate. Democrats, joined by the GOP's Hatch,
have called it inadequate while offering to merge its tax credit
provisions with the direct subsidies provided to parents and child
care providers under the ABC plan.
   Benefits under Bush's plan would be available mainly to those
making under $10,000 a year. The Democratic subsidies would be
available according to formulas determined at the state level.
   An aide to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell predicted
Dole's effort to substitute his proposal for the Dodd-Hatch measure
would fail. ``Senator Mitchell has proven in the past that he knows
how to count,'' the aide said.
   Mitchell, unable to reach agreement with Republicans on a
timetable to bring the issue to a final vote, warned he would delay
a two-week Senate recess due to begin next week if debate and
amendments prevented a final vote by Friday.
   ``This is a very important matter,'' Mitchell said. ``We're going
to stay as long as it takes.''
   With Dole holding his plan, the highlight of Tuesday's debate was
Hatch's angry criticism of fellow Republicans and conservatives.
   Waving a copy of a circular distributed at a Republican caucus
that attacked the Dodd-Hatch bill, Hatch said he did not mind
arguments over honest disagreements but added: ``I mind people who
try to win their case with falsehoods.'' He said the letter was on
paper without a letterhead. ``I do not know who prepared this piece
of junk.''
   As revised, the ABC bill would authorize $1.75 billion for child
care programs in fiscal 1990, with 70 percent of the money going to
low-income parents to help them pay for child care. The remaining
funds would go to states for programs to improve the quality and
quantity of available child care.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier for Government to Conduct Tax-Fraud Investigations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a partial victory for the
Internal Revenue Service in its legal battles with the Church of
Scientology, today made it easier for the government to conduct
tax-fraud investigations.
   The justices ruled 8-0 that judges privately may examine
communications between lawyers and clients to determine whether such
information should be turned over to the government.
   But the justices, in a victory for the Scientologists, also
upheld a ruling that permits judges to prevent information sought by
the IRS from being turned over to other government agencies.
   The vote on that issue was 4-4. But the breakdown _ in line with
Supreme Court tradition on tie votes _ was not disclosed.
   Justice William J. Brennan did not take part in the case.
   The government, which has had numerous legal battles with the
Scientologists, began an investigation in 1984 of the tax returns of
the church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. He died on Jan. 24, 1986.
   The IRS said it suspected that millions of dollars in church
funds were transferred to Hubbard in the late 1970s and early 1980s
in a scheme to protect the church's tax-exempt status and avoid
paying taxes on the money.
   The IRS issued a summons in October 1984 for 13 confidential
documents held by a California state court in connection with a
private lawsuit involving the church.
   A federal judge ruled that five of the documents should be turned
over to the IRS but only on condition the IRS not disclose the
contents to any other government agency except in connection with a
criminal tax prosecution.
   That part of the judge's ruling was upheld by today's tie Supreme
Court vote.
   The judge also blocked the IRS from obtaining the other eight
documents, particularly taped conversations of confidential
lawyer-client communications.
   The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
all of the judge's ruling in 1986.
   The appeals court said the government is not entitled to see
attorney-client communications unless it can produce independent
evidence that the lawyer is taking part in a fraud.
   The Supreme Court today unanimously overruled the appeals court
on that point.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said the
lawyer-client tapes may be examined by the trial judge in the
privacy of his office to determine whether there is evidence of
fraud.
   The case is U.S. vs. Zolin, 88-40.

<HEAD>Government Bans South Koreans from Attending North Korean Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Wednesday refused to
allow 40 Christian youths and newspaper reporters to attend a
festival in North Korea, saying their participation would harm
national interests.
   The refusal confirmed an earlier ban on South Koreans taking part
in the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students scheduled July 1-8.
   ``The Pyongyang gathering is not in conformity with the
government's basic unification policy and is detrimental to our
national interest,'' National Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo told
reporters.
   He added, however, that Seoul will continue to encourage contacts
with North Korea that do not harm South Korean interests.
   Lee said senior government officials turned down the requests
from 40 Christian youths and journalists.
   The decision came after authorities denied entry visas to three
festival delegates who wanted to travel to Seoul.
   Delegates from Belgium, Jamaica and Uruguay were refused entry
visas by the South Korean consulate in Hong Kong and were not
allowed to board a Korean Air plane, delegation leader Theo Celens
said by telephone from Hong Kong.
   Celens, a Belgian representing the Vienna-based International
Union of Socialist Youth, said his delegation wanted to urge Seoul
to let South Koreans join the festival.
   ``Our intention was to have a neutral contact,'' he said, adding
the festival committee did not want only radical South Koreans, but
``a balanced delegation.''
   North Korea has invited about 500 South Korean students and
dissidents to join in the sports, cultural and political event
attended mainly by students from Third World and communist nations.
   Seoul accuses Pyongyang of using the festival to dramatize its
demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops based in South Korea under
a mutual defense treaty.
   The festival's organizing committee said Wednesday the South
Koreans could attend as observers if their government was concerned
about the festival's political nature, according to the official
North Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo.
   ``We have given assurances that we would not do anything that may
impose a political burden on the South Korean youth and students
participating in the festival and that we had no intention to use
them politically,'' it quoted the committee as saying.

   A judge temporarily restored driving
privileges today to a teen-age father-to-be whose license was
revoked because he dropped out of school.
   Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib Jr. set aside Michael Means' license
revocation for 30 days while lawyers file briefs and the judge makes
a decision.
   Means, 17, who dropped out in ninth grade last year, is appealing
the loss of his license May 30 under a first-of-its-kind law aimed
at curbing truancy in a state where the dropout rate is around 17
percent.
   Under the law passed last summer, students under 18 who miss more
than 10 consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences
lose their driving privileges.
   Means, whose 16-year-old wife, Tonya, is expecting their first
child this fall, sued on June 8, the first time the law has been
challenged in court. His father said the teen-ager cannot support
his growing family without a license.
   The law allows school boards to grant hardship exceptions, but
state officials maintain that the teen-ager could hold a job and
still complete his education.
   Educators have praised the legislation, saying its brings
teen-agers back to school, but Means' lawyer, Chris Butch, has
argued that it conflicts with another law allowing students to drop
out at 16. He called the law ridiculous.
   ``It says you're poor, you dropped out of high school, and now
we're going to punish you some more,'' Butch said.
   Several states, including Wisconsin and Texas, where Gov. Bill
Clements signed a dropout bill into law Friday, have similar laws.
   The judge today Zakaib said Means keep his driving privileges if
he enrolls in a high school equivalency course and makes
satisfactory progress.
   ``I think they're trying to force me to go into a GED program and
I don't like being forced to do anything,'' Means said after the
hearing.

   The nation's mayors today adopted a
statement deploring recent Supreme Court decisions that they say
weaken affirmative action.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors also called for higher federal
taxes and a ban on possession of semi-automatic weapons.
   Before wrapping up their annual conference, the mayors also
settled an unprecedented contested race for the conference's future
leadership, choosing Democrat Ray Flynn of Boston over Republican
William Althaus of York, Pa.
   The mayors overwhelmingly voted down an effort by some Florida
mayors to soften the language of their resolution on
anti-discrimination in employment.
   Mayor Cecil Bradbury of Pinellas Park, Fla., argued that whites
have been victims of discrimination through efforts aimed at
encouraging minority employment.
   But the mayors sided with Republican William Hudnut of
Indianapolis, who argued that without affirmative action, ``the good
ol' boy network'' will favor whites.
   The mayors said recent Supreme Court decisions are ``making it
more difficult to ensure equal opportunities in employment for all
Americans.''
   Among the other statements, the mayors called for higher federal
taxes to cut the deficit and allow more urban aid, and urged a ban
on possession of military-type semi-automatic assault weapons.
   The five-day meeting of mayors from around the nation neared an
end one day after the session erupted into partisan name-calling,
with New York's Ed Koch launching a bitter tirade against the
Republican national chairman.
   Flynn was elected chairman of the organization's advisory
committee, an unglamorous title but a job that puts him in line to
be president of the conference in 1991.
   The vote was cast largely along party lines, 67-35, although
Houston's Kathy Whitmire, a Democrat and incoming president of the
group, sided with the Republican.
   Flynn said the issue was whether the mayors wanted an outspoken
critic of President Bush who would challenge Republican policies.
Whitmire, from Bush's Texas, has said she is optimistic about the
new administration.
   ``I don't think this is time for mayors to sit back and just go
along, to say everything's all right in our cities. Everything is
not all right in our cities,'' Flynn said.
   The contest for advisory committee chairman was thrown to the
full conference when two Democrats sided with the Republicans and
deadlocked a nominating committee that for 57 years has settled such
matters in private.
   The meeting, where partisanship is often submerged in discussions
of common urban needs, saw party bickering flare when Lee Atwater,
the GOP national chairman, spoke Monday.
   Even some Republicans complained about his blunt partisan speech,
including Atwater's statement that he was targeting Koch's
re-election race.
   Arriving Tuesday, Koch denounced Atwater as ``amoral'' and a
``pathological'' liar. He said Atwater bore responsibility for the
Republican memo that attacked House Speaker Tom Foley with
homosexual innuendo and had lied in denying it.
   ``He may be the best hired gun in the world, but he carries with
him all of the things that America hates, which is low-level,
disgusting tactics ... vile things,'' Koch said of Atwater.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, who previously called for
Atwater's resignation, also addressed the group Tuesday and laced
his speech with blasts at Atwater. Brown accused his Republican
counterpart of having ``taken politics to the lowest level of my
lifetime.''
   ``Thanks to the Lee Atwaters of the world, national politics is
looking more and more like the coastline of Valdez, Alaska,'' Brown
said. ``Make no mistake, they want the political oil spill of
negative campaigning to spread across America.''
   In Washington, RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said, ``We assume
Ed Koch has said all these things because he's in a heated race for
mayor.'' She had no comment on Brown's remarks.
   The partisanship, combined with the unusual leadership race,
dominated discussions among the mayors.
   Indianapolis Republican Mayor William Hudnut, who on Tuesday had
said he was ``embarrassed and disappointed'' by Atwater's remarks,
criticized Brown on Wednesday.
   ``I just think politicizing the meeting is wrong, and Ron was as
guilty as Lee was,'' Hudnut said.
   He noted that many mayors are elected in races where no party
affiliation is listed, and said the conference shouldn't invite
national party chairmen again.
   ``We work very hard not to be partisan in this organization,''
added Althaus, who was working to avoid a party-line vote in his own
race since Democratic mayors outnumber Republicans.
   The race was for the job of chairman of the conference's advisory
committee. It carries an unglamorous title, but the job is third on
the group's leadership ladder and means the winner will be scheduled
to assume the post of president of the conference _ and leading
spokesman for the nation's mayors _ in 1991.
   The race had partisan dimensions because a victory by Althaus
would mean the conference would have two consecutive Republican
leaders for the first time ever.
   Republican Mayor Bob Isaac of Colorado Springs, Colo., has the
job and is scheduled to be president in 1990, following Democrat
Kathryn Whitmire of Houston, who was to assume the presidency today
after a year as vice president.
   The mayors were ending their meeting having barely mentioned the
scandals involving the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
which is beset by allegations of influence peddling and disclosures
of embezzlement.
   ``We can't let the Republicans turn housing programs for the poor
into subsidy programs for wealthy Republican consultants,'' Brown
said in one of the few public airings of the issue this week.

   Andrei Sakharov received a prolonged
ovation Wednesday as Oxford University honored ``a noble champion of
harmony'' with an honorary doctorate in science.
   Dressed in a scarlet and gray gown, the Soviet human rights
activist stood in silence as the Professor of Poetry Peter Levi
described his work and words as a ``harbinger of glasnost.''
   Sustained applause rang through the Sheldonian Theatre for
several minutes as Sakharov received his degree from Chancellor Roy
Jenkins.
   Oxford also bestowed a doctorate of civil law on Queen Sofia of
Spain ``in appreciation of her hard and varied work for the Arts and
for Music''.
   Sakharov, accompanied by his wife, is on his first trip to
Britain. The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner received an honorary
degree at Sussex University on Monday, and will meet Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher on Friday.
   The 68-year-old physicist was elected to the newly formed
Congress of the People's Deputies by the Soviet Academy of Sciences
in April, three years after he was freed from internal exile in the
city of Gorky. He had been sent there as punishment for his
dissident activities, including criticism of the Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan.

<HEAD>First Tourists in Tibet Since Martial Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten tourists from West Germany and Switzerland
arrived in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on Tuesday, the first tour
group to visit the city since martial law was imposed there March 7.
   The tourists, organized by a Swiss travel group, entered Tibet by
land from Nepal, according to the People's Daily.
   An employee at the Lhasa Hotel, who identified himself only as
Wang, said the group arrived Tuesday and would leave Saturday. He
said a second group was to arrive Sunday.
   Wang said a notice had been issued reopening Lhasa to tourist
groups, although individual tourists were still barred from entering
the city.
   In Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, a travel agency
employee said he had heard nothing on lifting the ban on tourist
travel to Lhasa. Chengdu is the jumping-off point for all flights to
the mountaintop city.
   China imposed martial law in Lhasa after several days of violent
anti-Chinese demonstrations, the third bloody outbreaks of rioting
in a 18-month period. All foreign travelers and journalists were
ordered out of the city.
   The government has not said how long the military will remain in
Lhasa.
   Tourism had become a major source of revenue for the impoverished
Tibetan area. In 1987, 40,000 foreign tourists spent $8 million in
Tibet.

   Thai jet fighters dropped bombs
and helicopter-borne U.S. infantrymen swooped down on imaginary
enemies Wednesday in the climax to this year's joint war games.
   About 400 U.S. troops and a like number of Thai soldiers took
part in a day of live fire exercises in hilly, forested countryside
about 200 miles northwest of Bangkok.
   The scenario in the ``Cobra Gold '89'' war games called for the
two sides to resist an enemy push and launch a counterattack with
the support of tanks, artillery and air strikes.
   A company from the 3rd Brigade of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division
was flown into attack position while jets and helicopter gunships
provided support.
   Both sides flew supersonic F-16 fighters, which Thailand has
acquired from the United States. Two Thai Air Force F-5 warplanes
dropped 500-pound bombs on a hillside.
   The exercise was watched by military attaches from the region and
Brig. Gen. Mya Thien of Burma.
   Burmese troops have recently intruded and fired weapons into
Thailand while fighting Karen rebels. The fighting continues along
the frontier just west of where the games were staged.
   ``Cobra Gold '89,'' the eighth in this annual series, began June
3 and has involved 6,000 Thai troops and 3,200 U.S. personnel,
including 2,000 from the Hawaii-based U.S. 25th Infantry Division.
   The United States, which based thousands of troops in Thailand
during the Vietnam War, is the country's key Western ally.

<HEAD>4 Arrested in Baby-Selling Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four people, including a father-daughter team of
lawyers, ran a baby-selling scheme that bilked 100 couples of
$500,000, authorities charged.
   Only 50 couples got babies, state Attorney General Robert Abrams
said Tuesday. Some others who had paid up to $16,000 got neither a
child nor a refund after being told the mother miscarried or changed
her mind, he said.
   Authorities said the brokers actually were selling the babies to
the highest bidder, doing business in such places as the parking lot
of an International House of Pancakes.
   The mothers, mostly unwed teen-agers from rural areas, were lured
through ads in The Star, a supermarket tabloid, and offered help
with adoption, counseling, free medical care and financial support.
   The adoptive couples were middle-class people from urban areas in
21 states and Canada.
   Seymour Fenichel and his daughter, Deborah Fenichel Greenspan,
both lawyers, and Harriet and Lawrence Lauer, all of New York City,
were indicted on 144 counts.
   The four pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of grand larceny,
conspiracy, fraud, perjury, filing false documents and making false
statements by illegally operating Child Haven of Northeastern
Pennsylvania, a private adoption agency.
   Abrams said neither the mothers who gave up their children nor
the adoptive parents face charges. Officials also said it was
unlikely the mothers would try to get the children back.
   Partly because the four defendants used a legitimate social
worker to process the adoption cases through the courts, the
attorney general said he felt the children were in good hands and
the adoptions were not reversible.
   The Lauers' attorney, Harvey Baum, said, ``Our clients'
involvement with adoption agencies have sprung from their own
experiences in overcoming great obstacles in obtaining their own
children in adoption.
   ``Their actions were always generated from good intentions and to
help others who had the same problems they had,'' he said.
   Mrs. Lauer wrote an article for Good Housekeeping magazine in
1979 about getting her younger daughter through a classified ad.
   Fenichel was released on $100,000 bail, his daughter on $2,500.
The Lauers were released and given two weeks to raise $10,000 bail.
   The most serious charge carries a maximum of seven years in
prison and a $5,000 fine or double the amount illegally gained.
Abrams said he would seek restitution for the couples.

<TEXT>
   The government today said the
15-week-old guerrilla siege of Jalalabad had ended with a government
victory and that troops were pushing the insurgents toward Pakistan.
   Guerrilla leaders denied that the bloodiest battle in the
decade-long war was over.
   There was no way to independently verify either claim.
   Jalalabad, the capital of Nangahar province and once the
country's fifth-largest city, came under rocket and artillery
bombardment March 7, three weeks after Soviet troops left
Afghanistan and ended their nine-year intervention.
   ``We have conquered Jalalabad from the opponents,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani, quoting the province's
military commander, Gen. Asif Delawar.
   In Pakistan, where the insurgents are based, guerrilla spokesman
Azim Nasser-Zia of the moderate National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan said of the government claim, ``It's certainly not
true.''
   Abdul Rahim, a spokesman for the more fundamentalist
Jamiat-i-Islami, added: ``The siege is not over. But if they're
talking about opening part of the Jalalabad highway, that may be
true.'' He also spoke from Pakistan.
   He was referring to the battles for control of the key supply
route between Pakistan and Kabul, the capital. Government forces
have succeeded in pushing through any number of supply and weapons
convoys, but the guerrillas have periodically regained control and
sealed off the road.
   An editor for the Afghan News Agency, an organ of hard-line
guerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, called the report
``propaganda.'' He did not want to be quoted by name.
   Amani said government forces had pushed the guerrillas about 15
miles east. ``The government's mopping up operations are still
continuing. Every day we are able to destroy deserted rebel posts,
bunkers and their other hideouts,'' he said.
   ``Day by day, the number of attacks on Jalalabad is decreasing
rapidly,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. ``More and more
people are coming to their fields to work. This is a definite sign
that things are getting better and normal there.''
   However, he added, government troops still need time to clear the
area.
   ``There may still exist isolated rebel positions on the outskirts
of the city,'' he said. ``Our military aim is to push the rebels
further toward the frontier, and we are succeeding.''
   Jalalabad, which had a population of 64,600, is 75 miles east of
Kabul and 45 miles west of Pakistan.
   When the siege began, guerrilla leaders predicted the city would
fall in three days, giving them a base for an interim government and
paving the way for the final drive to Kabul.
   The rebels captured several key outposts in the early fighting.
But they failed to unite into a cohesive force capable of mounting a
sustained attack.
   The guerrillas have been fighting to topple the Soviet-backed
government since it seized power in an April 1978 coup. More than
1.3 million Afghans have died in the fighting.
   Also today, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said the U.S. State
Department should send a representative to Kabul to negotiate the
release of a captured American photographer.
   The government initially did not name the photographer,
identifying him only as a U.S. journalist. Rebel sources in Pakistan
identified him as Tony O'Brien, a freelancer from Santa Fe, N.M., on
an assignment for Time-Life Inc.
   The government later acknowledged today on state-run Radio Kabul
that it was O'Brien who was being held.
   Radio Kabul said O'Brien was captured June 8 on the outskirts of
Kabul. Rebel sources in Pakistan, however, claimed the arrest was
made June 14. It was not possible to clarify the discrepency.
   The government accused the photographer of illegally entering the
country without a visa and being in company of armed guerrillas.
   At least three Western journalists and two foreign aid workers
have been captured while traveling with rebels during the war. All
were released unharmed. O'Brien is the first American captured.

<TEXT>
   House Democrats on Wednesday elected Steny
Hoyer of Maryland to their fourth-ranking leadership post, filling
the last major vacancy left from the shake-up that began with the
ethics probe of Speaker Jim Wright.
   Hoyer, 50, defeated Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Ct., 165-82, for
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. Two votes were cast for
others during the closed meeting of all House Democrats.
   Hoyer has served as deputy chairman of the caucus for six months.
   The caucus chairman has few official duties other than to preside
over party meetings, but the post has been a launching pad to higher
positions.
   Hoyer succeeds Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., who moved up to
majority whip last week. Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., resigned as
majority whip rather than face an inquiry into his personal finances.
   ``It's considered to be a major step in the leadership ladder of
the House of Representatives,'' said Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., himself a former caucus chairman.
   Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the newly elected majority leader, is
also a former chairman.
   The election was part of the Democrats' ongoing effort to restore
their leadership ranks in the wake of ethics inquiries that led to
the resignation of Wright, D-Texas.
   Foley succeeded Wright, Gephardt took over for Foley and Gray
replaced Coelho..
   Wednesday's vote means the party still includes no women in its
top ranks.
   ``I thought it was time the Democratic Party had a woman's face
in the leadership,'' Kennelly said after her defeat.
   Hoyer, a liberal member in his fifth term, agreed.
   ``I'd like to see a woman in the leadership ... although I was
not prepared to drop out of the race,'' he said.

<HEAD>Justice Department Charges Suburb Over Group Home for Retarded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suburban Chicago Heights violated an
anti-discrimination law when its City Council blocked construction
of a home for mentally retarded adults, the U.S. Justice Department
alleges in a lawsuit.
   It is the first lawsuit brought by the department alleging
housing discrimination against the handicapped under the Fair
Housing Amendments Act that took effect March 12, the agency said in
a news release.
   At issue is a May 1 vote by the City Council in the southern
suburb of 32,000 people, denying a special-use permit for
construction of a home for 15 mentally retarded adults in a
neighborhood of single-family and two-family homes, the department
said.
   The complaint, filed Tuesday in federal court in Chicago,
contends the council denied the request because of neighbors'
opposition ``based on fears and prejudices,'' the statement said.
   ``Under the new Fair Housing act, stereotypes and baseless fears
concerning the handicapped cannot be used to block the development
of group homes,'' said James P. Turner, acting assistant attorney
general in charge of of the Civil Rights Division, in the statement
issued in Washington.
   ``Studies have shown that these facilities are better for
residents than the out-of-sight, out-of-mind institutions of the
past, and that they have no adverse effects on the neighborhood,''
Turner said.
   James Creswell, corporation counsel for Chicago Heights, did not
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the lawsuit.
   Chicago Heights Police Commissioner John Gliottoni, one of the
five council members, would not comment on the merits of the case
because of the lawsuit.
   But he said the council followed the lead of the city's zoning
board and its plan commission in the decision.
   ``They are the sounding boards,'' Gliottoni said of the two
panels. ``They listen to all the people who are for it and all the
people who are against it. We as council members have no input
whatsoever.''
   He said both groups denied zoning approval, and the Council
followed those recommendations, as it does more than 99 percent of
the time.
   The Justice Department statement said the building permit was
sought by RFMS Inc., a Galesburg company that specializes in
developing homes for the retarded. There was no answer at a
telephone number listed for RFMS.

<HEAD>Court Eases Way for Railroad to Sell Off Lines Without Labor Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, today gave
railroads greater leeway to sell off rail lines without first
entering into collective bargaining about a sale's effects.
   The court, resolving one of the most critical issues facing the
nation's railroad industry, said the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie
Railroad, or P&amp;LE, may sell its 182 miles of rail line in eastern
Ohio and western Pennsylvania without first negotiating with its
employees' unions.
   Interpreting the Railway Labor Act, a federal law governing the
railroad and airline industries, the court said the P&amp;LE was not
obligated to bargain over the effects of the sale, including lost
jobs.
   The P&amp;LE, having lost $60 million in the five previous years,
announced in 1987 that it had agreed to sell its trackage and other
assets for about $70 million to a newly formed subsidiary of the
Chicago West Pullman Transportation Corp.
   The subsidary intended to operate the railroad as the P&amp;LE had,
except that it would not assume the P&amp;LE's union contracts and would
lay off about 500 of the railroad's 750 employees.
   When the unions were notified of the sale, they challenged it as
a violation of the Railway Labor Act. The Interstate Commerce
Commission, however, approved the sale.
   A federal trial judge and the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the P&amp;LE was legally obligated to negotiate with its
unions about the sale's effects on the workforce.
   Today, the Supreme Court said the lower courts were wrong.
   After the sale was postponed, the P&amp;LE sought a new purchaser.
Today's decision also makes that pursuit easier.
   Writing for the high court, Justice Byron R. White said the P&amp;LE
was not obligated to postpone its sale of the trackage ``beyond the
time the sale was approved by the commission and was scheduled to be
consummated.''
   He added: ``To the extent that the unions' demands could be
satisfied only by the assent of the buyers, they sought to change or
dictate the terms of the sale, and in effect challenged the decision
to sell itself.
   ``At that time, P&amp;LE was under no obligation to bargain about the
terms it had already negotiated,'' White wrote.
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and Harry A. Blackmun dissented.
   But by a unanimous vote the court left unresolved _ and sent back
to the 3rd Circuit court for further study _ the related issue of
what authority federal courts have to block strikes in such cases.
   The cases are Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad vs. Railway Labor
Executives Association, 87-1859, and P&amp;LE vs. RLEA, 87-1888.

<TEXT>
   Two of six black candidates won judgeships
in elections ordered by a judge who said Mississippi's judicial
districts discriminated against blacks.
   Mississippi now has five blacks among its 78 judges, a gain of
one after Tuesday's elections. One incumbent lost.
   ``In spite of some black leaders' allegations that there is no
more discrimination in Mississippi, these election results are clear
indication that discrimination is alive and well in Mississippi and
will probably be around for some time to come,'' said attorney
Carrol Rhodes.
   Rhodes was one of the lawyers who represented blacks in a 1986
federal lawsuit that resulted in the redrawing of judicial districts
in Mississippi.
   ``Voting patterns along racial lines, if it has been changing,
it's becoming more pronounced,'' he said. ``It just shows that we
have a lot more work to do.''
   Mississippians on Tuesday also finally removed from the state
constitution an unenforcable poll tax that was enacted years ago to
keep blacks from voting but was struck down by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1966.
   With 98 percent of the vote in, unofficial returns had 99,648
voting for repeal of the tax and 72,844 against repeal.
   The state's four black judges are Supreme Court Justice Reuben
Anderson, Circuit Judges Fred L. Banks Jr. and Lillie
Blackmon-Sanders and Chancery Judge Isaac Byrd.
   Each was appointed to fill a vacancy, but Anderson went on to win
a full eight-year term in 1986; he was not up for election Tuesday.
Byrd did not seek election, Banks was unopposed and Blackmon-Sanders
was challenged.
   Blackmon-Sanders lost to Republican challenger Richard Watson,
12,878 votes to 9,600. One other black Democrat, Isadore W. Patrick
of Vicksburg, was unopposed in the general election.
   The two black winners in contested races were Pat Wise, a
Democrat, who defeated Republican Billy W. Keyes for an open Hinds
County chancery judge's post, 5,942 votes to 1,638; and Denise Sweet
Owens, also a Democrat, who defeated Republican George M. Arthur in
another open family court post, 4,628 votes to 1,259.
   Black candidates Solomon Curtis Osborne, Clell G. Ward and Harold
Brittain all lost to incumbents.
   ``I am disappointed with the situation as it now exists outside
of Jackson,'' said former state Sen. Henry Kirksey of Jackson, one
of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that resulted in the redistricting.
Jackson is the county seat of Hinds County and the state capital.
   Kirksey said the voting vindicated his complaints about the
redrawing of some of the districts. He also said there wasn't enough
time to persuade black voters to cast ballots only for black
candidates.
   U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. ruled in 1987 that
Mississippi's judicial districts discriminated against blacks. The
ruling, the first to apply the 1965 Voting Rights Act to judicial
elections, was upheld on appeal.
   Barbour ordered some districts redrawn to create minority
subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to
elect black judges.
   Sixteen elections were contested Tuesday. Those elected will take
office on July 3.

<HEAD>Children Withdrawn from Program After Nude Photos Viewed</HEAD>

   Three parents withdrew their children
from a day-care program after the children saw nude photographs at a
museum exhibit during a field trip.
   Victoria McDowell said she took the children, ages 3-9, last week
to ``Where the Boys Are,'' an exhibit at the Children's Museum at
Sunrise, but was surprised to find photographs of naked men and
women.
   J. Hornor Davis, the museum's executive director, said hundreds
of children had toured the exhibit in school groups without
complaint. ``We don't feel the current exhibit is in any way
pornographic, or gratuitous,'' he said.
   ``We went in to the room to the right, and there scattered in
among the artwork were some black and white photos of naked men,''
said McDowell.
   ``I told the kids we must be in the wrong section, so we went to
the other side, and there were some photos from the Rainbow Family
festival of naked men and women standing in front of tents and on
creek banks,'' McDowell said. ``I took the kids upstairs, and it was
the same up there.''
   McDowell said three parents withdrew their children when she told
them about the incident.

   A federal judge today refused to accept a
guilty plea from a company indicted for water pollution, demanding
Pennwalt Corp. send its ``top man'' rather than the three executives
it flew in from Philadelphia.
   The case involved a 1985 spill into Tacoma's Hylebos Waterway in
which at least 75,000 gallons of a cancer-causing chemical escaped
from a ruptured 180,000-gallon storage tank that had been poorly
maintained.
   An undetermined amount of the chemical reached the waterway in an
overflow last year.
   In a plea bargain, Pennwalt agreed to pay $1.1 million for the
spills.
   ``Before I accept this plan the top officer of your company will
be here. Not a division; the top man,'' U.S. District Judge Jack
Tanner told Pennwalt senior vice president Marty Schwartzberg.
   In addition to Schwartzberg, Pennwalt sent a senior vice
president for legal matters and president of the company's inorganic
chemical division.
   Tanner had told attorneys in May that he would not accept the
plea unless a Pennwalt executive was present, but he didn't specify
which executive.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Marshall told the judge that he was
satisfied that Schwartzberg and another of the executives ``are very
high in this company and should be able to answer any questions the
court has.''
   Pennwalt lawyer Tom Kelly argued it was very unusual to compel
executives to appear in such cases. Usually, a company pleads
through its attorneys.
   ``People in this company have had deterrence imprinted on their
memory through this investigation,'' Kelly said. ``There will be
deterrence here, your honor.''
   Tanner, however, cited statistics indicating Washington ranks
second in the country in the number of such reported pollution
violations.
   ``Apparently deterrence is not being very effective,'' he said.
   The judge rescheduled the plea hearing for July 19.

   The photograph of German women staring
longingly at a pile of sausages in a store window captures the
essence of the aerial foodline provided by the Western Allies 40
years ago in defiance of the Soviet blockade of Berlin.
   The photo belongs to an exhibit that opened Wednesday at the Air
and Space Museum to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Berlin
Airlift, mounted at the height of the Cold War by the United States,
England and France.
   ``The airlift guaranteed the liberty and survival of the free
part of Berlin,'' said West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, who opened the exhibit.
   Known by welcoming Berliners as the ``Raisin Bombers,'' the
planes of the airlift kept alive the Western occupied sectors of the
city during a 15-month siege directed by Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
   More than 277,000 flights carried 2.3 million tons of supplies to
West Berlin by Sept. 30, 1949, when the Soviets gave up and reopened
roads, rails and waterways. Some 78 aircrew members were killed in
crashes and other incidents.
   While the airlift kept the city going, rations were meager.
   Robert Kimener, a retired Navy captain who spoke at the opening
of the exhibit, said he was astonished to learn that each family got
only 25 pounds of coal for the winter.
   Kimener, a pilot in a small naval air contingent that flew in the
airlift, said he visited a family in January 1949 whose Berlin
apartment seemed colder inside than the winter weather outside, even
though he wore his flight jacket.
   The average daily ration of food consisted of 35.2 ounces,
including 1.5 ounces of meat.
   ``We blockaded Berliners aren't starving, but we're always
hungry,'' an unidentified survivor is quoted as saying in the
catalogue which describes the 60 photographs and airplane models
shown in the exhibit.
   Heroes of the airlift, known affectionately by air crews as
``Operation Vittles,'' include the so-called ``Chocolate Pilot,'' an
American who dropped chocolates in handkerchief parachutes to
children of the blockaded city in Christmas 1948.
   Soviet forces, acting on a plan of Stalin to force the Western
Allies out of the city, halted all ground transportation into West
Berlin on June 24, 1948, and cut off Berliners from food, fuel and
other supplies.
   Within two days U.S. forces started an airlift that grew to a
nonstop series of cargo-plane takeoffs and landings every 90 seconds
at Berlin's three airports.
   One photograph shows Berlin's so-called ``rubble women'' hauling
debris from World War II destruction to build makeshift runways and
increase available landing strips.
   The supplies, including coal, milk and other rations, moved
though narrow air corridors from West Germany over the
Soviet-occupied East Zone that has become communist-controlled East
Germany.
   So tight were the flying schedules that planes failing to find
their landing strip immediately had to return to West Germany fully
laden and try again later.
   Included in the exhibit are cartons and cans of shortening,
coffee and powdered hot chocolate, some marked as gifts from the
people of the United States.
   Former pilot Kimener said air crews were in competion to carry
the most cargo and make the most flights.
   ``Fatigue was our constant companion,'' said Kimener, who
recounted that a Soviet plane once shot at his aircraft and that
Soviet decoy beacons lured at least one American plane to
destruction.

   About 80 veterans hissed as a Navy
retiree was found guilty of violating a noise law by flying the flag
on windy days.
   ``If it's criminal to fly the flag, then I'm John Dillinger,''
said Lee Bach, the World War II Naval veteran convicted Tuesday.
   Gena Contreras, a neighbor bothered by the snapping and popping
of the 3-by-5-foot banner atop Bach's 40-foot flagpole, filed the
public nuisance case after he rejected her request that he not fly
the flag while she was home.
   The offense carries up to 90 days in jail and a $300 fine.
   Municipal Judge Jose Coronado delaying sentencing to give Bach
and Ms. Contreras time to work out an agreement. But Bach said there
would be no settlement.
   ``I'm going to fly it every day come hell or high water,'' he
said, ``and there's nothing he can do about it except throw me in
jail.''
   Bach said he would appeal, and a veterans group promised to help
with legal expenses.
   Ms. Contreras had testified that the noise forces her family out
of the front part of their home and makes it impossible to relax in
the yard.

<HEAD>U.S. Soldier Pleads Guilty to Espionage Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULDA, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. serviceman who once had been
described as a model soldier pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he
gave defense secrets to East Germany.
   Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri changed his earlier plea of innocent just
as his court-martial began, said Army spokesman Maj. Samuel Taylor.
   Peri, 21, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., could be sentenced to life in
prison on the espionage charge.
   The charges were filed against Peri after he disappeared from the
11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda in February.
   At the time, military officials said they were baffled because
Peri had a reputation as model soldier and at one point had been
recommended for a ``Soldier of the Month'' award for his superior
performance. Peri returned voluntarily 11 days later.
   He was charged on March 16 with espionage. Officials said he had
given communist East Germany secrets on U.S. plans for the defense
of West Germany.
   Peri, dressed in a U.S. Army uniform, walked with his head bowed
into the Fulda U.S. Army Community Center where the court-martial
began. He was not handcuffed but was escorted by military police.
   Taylor said military officials had not expected Peri to change
his plea.
   Peri also pleaded guilty to charges of being absent without leave
and entering a restricted area near the East German border without
permission.
   The prosecution agreed to drop charges of larceny against Peri
after he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of ``wrongful
appropriation'' of a portable computer and a military vehicle he
used during his absence, Taylor said.
   Peri, stationed in West Germany since March 1988, had worked as
an electronics warfare signal specialist.
   After his return, U.S. military officials said the East Germans
themselves notified American authorities that Peri had made contact
with them.
   The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda, Peri's home unit,
comes under control of the U.S. Army's 5th Corps. The cavalry unit
is responsible for front-line defense along West Germany's border
with East Germany.
   The court-martial judge, Col. Craig C. Jacobson, ordered the
public out of the courtroom while specifics of the secret
information Peri allegedly gave to the East Germans were discussed.
   A board of military officers will be selected Thursday to hear
testimony that will help determine the length of Peri's sentence.
   Peri had been kept in investigative custody at the U.S. Army's
confinement facility in Mannheim before the court-martial. He now is
being held in Fulda, about 60 miles northeast of Frankfurt.

   Chinese students in the United States urged the
Bush administration Wednesday to step up economic pressure on the
Beijing government and announced plans to assemble in Washington
next month to write a constitution for a free China.
   ``The only language the Chinese government can listen to is
economic sanctions,'' said Ding Xueliang, 36, a sociologist and
graduate student at Harvard University.
   At a news conference at Constitution Hall, Ding and a dozen other
Chinese student organizers unveiled the formation of an umbrella
group, the Alliance of Chinese Patriots, to represent their
pro-democracy colleagues in the United States. They also disclosed
new tactics to get news into China of the government's brutal
crackdown on the movement.
   The information effort, according to Zhang Ya Qin, a student at
George Washington University, will include random mailings from
cities around the world and the transmission of newspaper and
magazine photos and articles to 1,000 fax receivers throughout
China. The students also intend to begin publishing in New York
their own bi-monthly magazine, called China Archives.
   As for the argument that a suspension of trade and development
assistance would only weaken Western influence and deprive the
Chinese people, Ding asked: ``How can you imagine that a government
which kills its own people would use foreign currency to benefit its
people?''
   President Bush froze U.S. military sales to China in the wake of
the bloody June 4 attack against student demonstrators in Beijing
and elsewhere, and on Tuesday he took steps to block at least $1.4
billion worth of international development loans. China still
retains most-favored-nation trade status with the United States,
however, and calls have escalated in Congress for him to take
sterner measures.
   Speaking just hours after Shanghai authorities executed three
protestors, Ding and his colleagues said thousands of Chinese
students in the United States already have signed a declaration of
principles calling for a constitutional convention in exile. The
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said recently there are
73,000 Chinese with active U.S. student visas.
   Ye Ning, a student at American University, said ``a
constitutional convention can be the banner of the Chinese people in
their fight for freedom ... the government is now trying to put the
genie back into the bottle, and it will find that very difficult.''
   No date has been fixed for the gathering, to be attended
principally by Chinese law students, but it will occur sometime next
month, said Ding. ``We've received strong moral support from
Congress and legal scholars in the United States,'' he said. ``We
believe in the United States _ we have learned from your
Constitution.''
   The declaration circulated by the group says: ``As the world
watches, we, the Chinese people, are today engaged in an epic
struggle to cast off the chains that have bound us for two
generations. The present system has been tried in China and has
failed. It has produced hunger where there should be plenty,
corruption where there should be integrity, servitude where there
should be freedom.''
   It listed these ``principles that guide our struggle for
freedom'':
   ``1. Every individual is born with equal and inalienable human
rights.
   2. The basic right of every individual is the right to be free,
the right to plan and live his or her own life. This right entails
all other rights, including the rights of speech, press, assembly,
association, religion, property, and privacy.
   3. To secure these rights, individuals create government, to
which they give only as much power as is necessary to secure their
rights.
   4. A government is legitimate only if it rests on the consent of
the governed.
   5. The people retain the right to deny legitimacy to their
government by withdrawing their consent.''

<HEAD>Coalition Talks Begin; Officials Named in Bribery Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A right-wing party and communist-dominated
alliance on Wednesday discussed forming a coalition government aimed
at cleaning up alleged corruption under the rule of defeated Premier
Andreas Papandreou.
   The consultations began as judicial investigators named two of
Papandreou's former Cabinet ministers in a bribery inquiry and asked
Parliament to lift immunity so that they can be prosecuted. The two
ministers named are former Deputy Premier Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas
and Public Order Minister George Petsos.
   At the same time, Koutsogiorgas' wife, Aliki, was among three
people charged with involvement in the alleged payment of a $2
million bribe to Koutsogiorgas.
   The reports of bribery and corruption involving leaders in
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Party led to its defeat in
Sunday's parliamentary election.
   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis and Harilaos Florakis,
the leader of a communist-dominated alliance, said the prosecution
of those involved in the scandals dominated their talks.
   ``We remained absolutely agreed on one thing, the issue of
catharsis and the scandals must not be written off,'' said Florakis,
whose alliance holds a decisive hand in forming a coalition
government.
   ``The dominant issue now is catharsis and political developments
must be oriented toward this objective,'' Mitsotakis said.
   Latest election results announced Wednesday gave Mitsotakis' New
Democracy Party 145 seats in the 300-member Parliament, six seats
short of the required majority. Papandreou, who has led Greece since
1981, won 125 seats. Florakis' alliance took 29 seats.
   The post-election posturing has taken on new significance in the
light of the corruption inquiry.
   Under the Greek Constitution, only the present or subsequent
Parliament has the power to lift the ministers' parliamentary
immunity and prosecute them. If no new government is formed and a
new election is called, those elected parliamentarians would be
unable to prosecute them.
   Mrs. Koutsogiorgas was charged with opening a joint Swiss bank
account with her husband where a bribe was deposited. The indictment
said the $2 million was a bribe to Koutsogiorgas, who was also
Justice Minister, for approving a banking law that helped hide
irregularities in the Bank of Crete.
   Also charged were bank owner George Koskotas and Kosotos' lawyer,
Yannis Mantzouranis.
   Mantzouranis, who also was the secretary of Papandreou's council
of ministers, was charged with arranging the bribe, and with keeping
an unspecified amount of the $2 million.
   Koskotas was charged with embezzling the $2 million and with
bribing Koutsogiorgas. He is in prison in the United States awaiting
the hearing of an extradition demand by the Greek government.
   No date was announced for a judicial hearing against those
charged.
   In the parliamentary request, the magistrates accused
Koutsogiorgas of accepting bribes while in office and Petsos with
accepting gifts.
   Parliament Speaker Yannis Alevras said the evidence against the
two ministers would be kept secret until its presentation to the
first session of the new Parliament, scheduled for July 3.
   Consultations to form a coalition government are expected to
continue until next week. Each of the three party leaders is given
given three days to try to accomplish this, with Mistotakis having
the first go.

<HEAD>Report Says Guard Pilot Medically Unfit to Fly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Indiana Air National Guard pilot
killed during an emergency landing after he blacked out would have
been grounded if officials had known he had high blood pressure, a
National Guard Bureau report says.
   First Lt. David E. Kruse had lied to flight surgeons, concealing
his medical problems for years, so he could fly F-4E Phantom
fighters assigned to the 122nd Tactical Fighter Wing at Baer Field,
said the report released Tuesday in Washington.
   ``Had the military medical staff been aware of the extent of
Kruse's civilian medical problems, he could never have been
medically qualified for flying duty,'' investigators said.
   Medical report forms indicate Kruse hid his blood pressure
problems from military doctors even though he had been a patient at
the Hypertension Research Center at Indiana University Medical
Center.
   Kruse fainted after shoveling snow Dec. 27, 1988, and his doctor
advised him to tell a flight surgeon about the blackouts, the report
said.
   Adj. Gen. Jack K. Elrod of the Indiana National Guard has ordered
flight surgeons to review the medical records of all flying
personnel.
   Kruse, 26, of Fort Wayne, blacked out about 10 minutes after
declaring an emergency and smoke in the cockpit during a Feb. 10
night training flight. He was about eight miles from the runway when
he lost consciousness.
   Maj. Wilburt J. Elliott, 39, the weapons systems officer, took
control from the jet's rear seat and landed. However, the plane
swerved off the runway, damaging the nose gear and activating an
automatic ejection system.
   An autopsy by Allen County Coroner Philip E. O'Shaughnessy found
Kruse suffered a broken neck, back and legs and internal bleeding,
all of which were enough to kill him.
   The autopsy showed no signs of smoke inhalation.
   ``We don't know why he passed out,'' said Chief Deputy Coroner
Robert Cummins. ``He was ejected, and then that's when he suffered
the injuries, naturally.''
   Cummins, who stressed he is not a doctor, said Kruse could have
passed out for any number of reasons. ``There's so many things that
could have caused that. Something wrong with the plane, the oxygen
in the plane ... but certainly the high blood pressure may have been
a factor,'' he said.
   Elliott, who also was ejected, suffered minor injuries.
   The report concluded the emergency Kruse reported involved a
hydraulic problem that corrected itself before he blacked out. The
cause of the cockpit smoke was not given.

   Two of every five American women giving birth
to their first children weren't married when they became pregnant,
the Census Bureau said Wednesday, a rise over the past two decades.
   The bureau also found a jump in the birth rate among women in
their 30s, noted that a majority of the women having a baby in the
year ending in June 1988 were in the work force, and said minorities
tend to have higher birth rates.
   In all, the bureau said the national fertility rate was 69.7
births per 1,000 women aged 18 to 44 in that year. Those are
considered the prime childbearing ages.
   Fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1,000 women
during this decade and the figure for 1988 is not considered
significantly different from the 71 recorded the year before.
   But changes have occurred among the women becoming mothers in
America.
   For women aged 15 to 29, the bureau found, 40 percent of their
first-born children from 1985 to 1988 were conceived out of
marriage, up from just over 30 percent when the measure was first
taken from 1970 to 1974.
   The 40 percent of new mothers who conceived out of wedlock
included 11.7 percent who got married before the child was born and
28.3 percent who were still unmarried when the baby arrived.
   The major change was among that second group, the women who were
still unmarried when the baby arrived. They increased from 17.9
percent of all first-time mothers in the early 1970s to the 28.3
percent recorded in 1985 to 1988.
   This shift ``may reflect the opinion of some women that they may
be better off in the long run by relying more on the support of
their parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistance
than by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solely
to prevent an out-of-wedlock birth,'' bureau analyst Amara Bachu
said in the report.
   At the same time that the share of unwed-mothers was rising, the
percentage of women conceiving while single and then getting married
before the arrival of the baby dropped from 14.9 percent to 11.7
percent of first mothers.
   The share of unwed first mothers varied sharply by race, the
study also found.
   Among black women 74.6 percent of first births to women aged 15
to 29 occurred out of wedlock from 1985 to 1988, up from 54.1
percent for 1970 to 1974.
   For Hispanic women, the rate was 30.6 percent, up from 26.7
percent earlier. And white women had 19.6 percent out-of-wedlock
births, up from 11.5 percent.
   The new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of women
postponing births as they pursue education and careers.
   The ``increases in childbearing among women over 30 ... suggest
that childless women now more than in the past are deliberately
postponing their childbearing to older ages,'' the report said.
   For women aged 30 to 34, the 1988 fertility rate was 81.6 births
per 1,000 women, up from 60 in 1980 and 56.4 in 1976. A similar,
though smaller, increase was reported for women 35 to 39.
   The bureau also asked women about their plans for families and
noted that, among childless wives aged 25 to 29, 85 percent still
expect to have a child at some point. That's up from 75 percent who
expected a future birth in this age group in 1975.
   Still, the study concluded, ``the question remains: How strong is
the commitment to childbearing after remaining married and childless
for several years?''
   For women aged 18 to 44, the study reported that 50.9 percent of
women giving birth in 1988 were in the work force, up from 50.8
percent a year earlier and just 38 percent in 1980.
   ``Labor force participation among women with newborn children is
appreciably higher for college-educated women that for women'' with
less education, the report found.
   Among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were in
the labor force, compared with 49 percent of high school grads and
34 percent who had not finished high school.
   By race, 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force,
compared with 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among Hispanics.

<HEAD>Fed Sees `Ebbing Expansion'in Some Regions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's economy continues to grow, but
there are ``ebbing rates of expansion'' in some regions, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday in a report that suggests the central bank
need not push up interest rates.
   The survey of economic conditions around the country indicated
that growth is slowing and inflationary pressures have eased in
response to an anti-inflation campaign launched by the Fed in March
1988.
   That's what the central bank sought to produce from its
15-month-long effort to curb inflation by pushing up interest rates
to cool off the economy. Earlier this month, the Fed eased up
slightly and made a small move to loosen its grip on credit in the
belief that the slowing economy would help tame price increases.
   Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent during the
first five months of 1989, up from price increases of 4.4 percent
during 1987 and 1988, but many analysts believe that inflation may
begin to level off and decline later this year.
   The survey, based on comments submitted by the Fed's 12 regional
banks, painted a picture of an economy in which slower growth could
help ease upward pressure on prices caused by tight labor markets
and strained factories.
   ``Economic activity for most of the nation continues to advance,
but a number of Federal Reserve districts note ebbing rates of
expansion,'' the survey said.
   ``With some exceptions, wage and price pressures are not
accelerating. Some districts said their respondents had not been
able to pass their input costs increases through to their
customers.''
   The economic survey, known as the Tan Book, will be used when Fed
policymakers meet July 5-6 to decide future monetary strategy. The
central bank tries to control inflation through its decision on how
much money it makes available to the banking system.
   Economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said the survey suggests ``the Fed may have more luck with a
soft landing than a lot of people think.'' In a soft landing, growth
slows enough to restrain inflation without toppling the country into
a recession.
   ``I would think that they (Fed officials) will pat themselves on
the back for a job well done up to this point, but there's nothing
in here that tells them they need to loosen aggressively,'' Ms.
Latta said of the survey. ``It just says expansion is ebbing, which
is what the Fed wants.''
   The survey reported that while auto sales have dipped, retail
sales generally are positive.
   Manufacturing growth is leveling off, real estate markets are
sluggish, and agriculture is benefiting from recent rains that have
helped alleviate drought conditions in some areas, the survey said.

<HEAD>Bomb Found Near Anti-Mafia Judge's Villa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday foiled an apparent
attempt to kill Italy's most celebrated Mafia fighter when they
discovered a bomb near his villa, news reports said.
   Security forces assigned to protect Judge Giovanni Falcone
reportedly found 44 pounds of plastic explosives stuffed inside a
waterproof bag.
   The guards, part of a 24-hour security detail, noticed the bag on
a sunbathing platform at the edge of the sea, about 20 yards from
the villa. The bag was the type used by divers to store their gear.
   Experts blew up the bomb.
   The Italian news agencies ANSA and AGI quoted explosives experts
who examined the bomb as saying it was clearly meant to kill the
judge or his family, who frequently went for swims in the morning.
   News agencies said investigators theorized that the potential
assassins had set up a surveillance base either in one of the nearby
villas or in a boat offshore. They theorized the bomb would have
been set off when Falcone went down the walk leading to the sea.
   When the bomb was discovered, Falcone was about to leave the
villa for a morning workout at a health club. His guards rushed him
instead to his heavily guarded office in Palermo's Palace of
Justice. It was not reported whether other members of his family
were home at the time.
   Falcone's investigations of the Mafia have led to hundreds of
convictions. He reportedly receives frequent threats, and his
security precautions are among the tightest in Italy.
   For his summer stay at the villa, guards have been stationed
along the road that runs above the villa, and police motor launches
periodically patrol offshore.
   Mafia members who turned informants have reportedly said that
Falcone is the top target of the organization.

   Firefighters laboring in 100-degree-plus heat today contained a
desert wildfire near the grotesquely shaped trees of California's
Joshua Tree Monument. In Florida, rain helped crews battling a blaze
in the dry Everglades.
   The 935-acre blaze in the desert raged within 1,000 feet of homes
and was the largest of four fires that burned 1,500 acres in
Southern California before being contained.
   A predicted high of 118 degrees, brittle vegetation and
capricious winds were expected to keep 375 firefighters on the fire
lines all day.
   One firefighter suffered burns on the face, said state Forestry
Department spokeswoman Deborah McClellan.
   The fire burned away from the Joshua Tree monument, a rugged area
named for the trees with dagger-shaped leaves and branches like
upraised arms. The Joshua Tree is common to the Southwest.
   The fire started Tuesday, prompting authorities to order the
evacuation of 85 homes as flames bore down on a neighborhood in the
city of Joshua Tree. But the fire was stopped short of the houses,
and most people had returned by late in the day.
   ``The residents had cleared the brush around their homes and if
it hadn't been for that clearance the homes would definitely have
burned,'' said McClellan.
   One outbuilding was destroyed in the sparsely populated area 110
miles east of Los Angeles.
   In Florida, rain brought firefighters closer to putting out a
wildfire that has scorched 43,700 acres of the Everglades. Nearly
400 firefighters from at least seven states battled the blaze, which
has been fed by wind and dry grass.
   ``If things work like they're working now, I'd say two to three
days,'' information officer Sam Logan said Tuesday. ``If all of a
sudden it dries up and we get some crazy winds, it could do
something else.''
   The area is so dry that alligators have abandoned secluded
marshes in the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife
Refuge, Florida's largest, for a canal on its rim. As a result, the
refuge has been closed to boaters and fishermen.
   In California, a 175-acre brush fire in the hills above San
Clemente was contained at 8 a.m., and firefighters earlier doused a
300-acre blaze in the Newbury Park area of Ventura County and a
115-acre fire in San Bernardino County's Devore area.

   The United States deeply regrets China's
execution of three men in the crackdown on pro-democracy forces, but
the administration is not considering additional sanctions against
Beijing, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today.
   ``There is an important relationship which we should seek to
preserve if we possibly can,'' Baker told reporters. ``That is a
consideration that must be taken on board when we consider what
specific actions'' should be taken.
   Baker spoke with reporters outside the White House as he
accompanied visiting West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher to a luncheon.
   ``We deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone
forward, notwithstanding appeals from the United States, appeals
from the Federal Republic of Germany and perhaps other countries,
for clemency,'' Baker said.
   Asked whether the United States would impose additional sanctions
in retaliation for the executions in Shanghai, he said: ``The United
States is not contemplating any additional action at this time.''
   Baker said President Bush believes that sanctions already in
place are the proper response to the bloody crackdown in China and
the arrests of more than 1,600 pro-democracy demonstrators. Eight
protesters in Beijing also have been condemned to die.
   Tightening diplomatic and financial pressure on China, Bush took
steps Tuesday to block at least $1.4 billion in development loans
while he said China is gripped by an ``atmosphere of suspicion and
reprisal.''
   Hours after the U.S. actions were announced, Chinese authorities
in Shanghai ignored the international pleas for clemency and shot to
death the three men, who had been convicted of setting a train on
fire. They were the first reported executions since the crackdown
began.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged today that
China has not been influenced by the United States or other nations.
   ``The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of
China and it does not appear to have made much difference,'' he
said, adding that ``history has shown that they generally are not
that responsive to outside kinds of pleas.''
   Fitzwater said the United States could not afford to turn its
back on China even though it deplores what is happening there.
   ``Everyone has to recognize, first of all, that this is a country
of a billion people ... a sizeable portion of the world's population
that cannot be closeted off and ignored,'' he said.
   Moreover, he said China plays an important role in regional
conflicts, such as Afghanistan, Cambodia and the Iran-Iraq war, and
also is a nuclear power that possesses ballistic missiles.
   ``It's important that we have some perspective in viewing the
overall, longterm relationship with China and that we believe we
have tried to strike the right balance,'' Fitzwater said.
   Genscher, at a picture-taking session with the president, was
asked his reaction to the executions.
   ``We are condemning the brutal ...,'' Genscher began. His comment
was interrupted by a White House aide who shouted an order that
ended the photo session. Bush made no comment.
   On Bush's orders, the United States will try to postpone
consideration of new loans to China by international financial
institutions.
   One administration source said the action could freeze $1.4
billion over the next six months from the World Bank and
International Development Bank. Other estimates indicated the figure
could be even higher.
   Bush also curtailed contacts by U.S. officials with their Chinese
counterparts, ordering a suspension of all high-level exchanges of
government officials with Beijing.
   While not affecting embassy-to-embassy contacts, it will force
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher to scrap a trip to China next
month, Baker said.
   ``This action is being taken in response to the wave of violence
and reprisals by the Chinese authorities against those who have
called for democracy,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   ``The U.S. hopes that the current tragedy in China can be brought
to a peaceful end and that dialogue will replace the atmosphere of
suspicion and reprisal,'' Fitzwater said. ``China is an important
state with which we hope to continue productive relations.''
   The latest action follows earlier orders for a freeze on military
sales to China and a suspension of contacts by military leaders.
   With the repression in China, Bush has been prodded by
conservative and liberal members of Congress alike to take tougher
action, such as withdrawing most-favored-nation trading privileges
from Beijing.
   The administration has argued that China is impervious to
pressure from the United States, and Bush has said he wants to
refrain from commercial sanctions that would hurt the Chinese people.
   Congressional Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., said at a House
Banking subcommittee hearing prior to Bush's action that China has
$4.7 billion in loans ``pending or in the pipeline'' at the World
Bank and $1.1 billion being processed by the Asian Development Bank.
The White House statement said Bush's action was aimed at new loans
to China, so it was unclear how much money was involved.

   Martha Reeves, who burned up the charts with her
recording of ``Heat Wave,'' thinks she's getting burned at the bank
by not getting royalties for the 1960s classic.
   The lead singer of Martha and the Vandellas sued Tuesday in Wayne
County Circuit Court Motown Records, its former owner Berry Gordy
Jr. and Jobete Music Co., asking for her share of royalties from the
hit.
   ``This is not vindictive,'' her attorney, S. Gary Spicer, said
Wednesday. Spicer said a specific amount of damages will be set and
sought after an accounting is made of the record's sales.
   Officials at Motown headquarters in Los Angeles did not

   After losing millions of dollars he made in the
ring, former boxing champion Leon Spinks is making a new start on
Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka's team _ Ditka's Restaurant team.
   The ex-fighter is a greeter and goodwill ambassador at the
restaurant, partly owned by the coach.
   ``I'm enjoying the people and the people are enjoying me,'' said
Spinks, an Olympic gold medal winner who shocked the boxing world
when he took the heavyweight crown in his eighth professional fight
from Muhammad Ali in 1978. Ali regained the championship seven
months later. Spinks, 35, retired last year.
   ``I've had my lumps and bumps, but now I've got my life on a roll
again,'' he said Tuesday.
   Spinks wouldn't say how much Ditka is paying him to mingle with
customers and represent the restaurant at charity events and other
occasions, but one report put it at $50,000 to $70,000 a year.

   Actor Ernest Borgnine, making an appearance
to promote teacher-training to help students avoid drugs, said such
a program is only one part of a battle he believes society must
fight on all fronts.
   ``The whole mess is getting the dealers. I'd say let's start
hanging them,'' said Borgnine, often portrayed as a heavy in movies.
   He appeared on behalf of the National Masonic Foundation for the
Prevention of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Among Children. The Masons are
contributing about $24,000 toward a state program to train 150
teachers each summer to identify students who may be abusing drugs
and find services to help them.
   The 72-year-old actor said, in response to questions, he may have
worked with people who used drugs in Hollywood, but added, ``It's no
more prevalent than it is in Peoria or Kansas or anywhere else.''

career sharing ``the last waltz with Diana.''
   The princess, a fan and former pupil, will be in the audience for
a charity performance of Sleep's current show. Sleep recently
announced he will retire in the fall and concentrate on acting.
   Unlike the night in 1985 when the couple danced a high-kicking
waltz at Covent Garden, no secret preparations for a royal turn have
been made. Sleep, however, is ready to dance.
   ``It would be my final glory to have my old partner back again,''
he told Press Association on Wednesday. ``It would be a dream come

   The 52-year-old former stock speculator has served 15 months of a

Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations of insider
trading. Boesky paid the SEC $100 million in alleged ill-gotten
profits and penalties in late 1986.
   The magazine quoted unidentified visitors to Boesky as saying he
has grown a full white beard and is ``impressively muscled.''
   ``Boesky works out every day at the outdoor weight area Lompoc
provides inmates, and he has built himself up substantially,'' the
magazine said.

   Eighteen Chinese refugees who arrived
in the Philippines by boat have asked for asylum in Taiwan because
they are afraid to return to their homeland, officials said
Wednesday.
   Immigration Chief Miriam Defensor Santiago said the 16 men and
two women would be turned over to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees to determine whether they can be classified as political
refugees.
   Ms. Santiago said the group, mostly fishermen, left the southern
Chinese province of Guangdong on April 29 and reached the northern
Philippines on May 3, a month before Chinese troops dispersed
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. They were brought to Manila
June 13, Ms. Santiago said.
   They apparently left China ``because they anticipated that
trouble was brewing ... that there was going to be political
commotion in the next few months,'' Ms. Santiago said.
   ``And at the same time, they left because of a desire to enhance
their economic status,'' she added. ``According to the affidavits
taken, they do not wish to return to mainland China. They are afraid
that they will be punished or killed by authorities in the mainland.
They wish to go to Taiwan because they think that there are better
job prospects there.''
   Seven of the 18 refugees went before reporters at Ms. Santiago's
office. The others were being held at the headquarters of the
Philippine army.
   When reporters asked why the refugees were afraid to return home,
one of them, Lim Niet Nee, replied: ``Because we will be killed.''
   ``We want to go to Taiwan or any other place other than China,''
Lim said through an interpreter.
   Karola Paul, deputy representative of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, said U.N. officials would interview the group and
consult with U.N. officials before deciding whether to certify them
as political refugees.
   In Taiwan, Liao Cheng-hao, deputy director of the Government
Information Office, said the Nationalist government would not accept
the 18 Chinese until they are confirmed to be political refugees and
not just people looking for a better life.
   Ms. Paul said the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees advised its
regional offices on June 12 to expect a possible exodus of Chinese
refugees from the mainland following the June 3-4 crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.

   A medicine commonly used to control epilepsy in
pregnant women appears to cause minor birth defects and retardation,
raising a dilemma about how to prevent seizures that can also harm
the unborn, a study concludes.
   Other epilepsy drugs have already been linked with birth defects.
Now researchers say that one called Tegretol or carbamazepine should
be added to the list.
   The drug's manufacturer questioned the way the study was
conducted and its conclusion.
   ``Physicians who treat women with seizures are in a very
difficult position,'' said Ronald V. Lacro, a co-author of the
study. ``This is the drug of choice because it seemed to be safe. We
can't say that anymore.''
   The study found evidence that women who took Tegretol during
pregnancy were more likely to produce babies with delayed
development and mental retardation. They were also more likely to
have unusual facial formations _ including upward slanting eyes,
long upper lips and short noses _ and incomplete development of the
fingernails.
   Ciba-Geigy, the company that makes Tegretol, said the latest
study is a reminder that the risks and benefits of anticonvulsant
drugs need to be weighed carefully, but that the medicine should
still be considered for epileptic women who want to have children.
   ``We feel that our past data show that Tegretol is a good option
for epileptic women. We still feel that way,'' said spokeswoman
Cathy Kernen.
   The study was directed by Dr. Kenneth Lyons Jones of the
University of California-San Diego. It was published in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine.
   Studies have found that severe epileptic seizures during
pregnancy can temporarily interrupt the flow of blood to the fetus,
causing brain damage. However, epileptic women have an increased
risk of producing babies with minor birth defects, even if they
don't have seizures during their pregnancies.
   ``Counseling has to start before pregnancy for these women,''
said Lacro, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital in Boston. ``If
the woman has severe enough seizures and needs the medicine, then by
all means you have to give it. But there is no completely safe
therapy other than being off medications.''
   The researchers first identified the pattern of birth defects in
eight children who had been exposed to the drug before birth. They
confirmed it by evaluating an additional 48 children whose mothers
had taken the medicine.
   They found that 11 percent of those exposed had facial
abnormalities, 26 percent had incomplete finger nails and 20 percent
were slow to develop.
   Only one of the youngsters with delayed development was old
enough to take an intelligence test. That child, aged 6, had an IQ
of 65.
   In a statement, Ciba-Geigy criticized the study for ``serious
methodological problems.'' It noted that the doctors used women who
did not have epilepsy in a comparison group. The higher risk of
birth defects among the children of the epileptic women might have
resulted from the epilepsy, not the medications, it said.
   Lacro said, ``I think that what we are seeing is due to the drug.
If the changes that we saw were due to seizures alone, then we would
see the same pattern of malformations for all kinds of seizure
drugs. I think the defects are drug specific, but I can't prove
that.''

   Nervous about falling under Chinese control,
residents of Hong Kong are applying for temporary visas to the
United States at an accelerating rate.
   But most of those wanting to move permanently from the world's
third-largest financial trading center are looking to other
countries.
   Last year, applications for non-immigrant _ or temporary _ visas
to visit the United States averaged 650 a day. Since Chinese troops
fired on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square June 3-4,
the daily total has risen above 1,000, the State Department said
Wednesday.
   There were no figures available on permanent immigration, but a
department official said other countries were preferred because U.S.
law restricts entry to aliens with close family ties to Americans,
occupations in demand here, or other specific qualifications. Other
countries are more lenient.
   Telephone calls for information to the U.S. consulate in Hong
Kong have increased, but most Hong Kong residents are well aware of
the U.S. rules, the official said.
   Britain's 99-year lease on Hong Kong expires in 1997 under terms
worked out with the Chinese in 1984. The agreement specifies that
Hong Kong would retain its status as an intenrational financial
center.
   The U.S. consulate reported to the State Department that
residents were ``nervous about coming under PRC (People's Republic
of China) sovereignty and they have responded with an unprecedented
demand for foreign visas,'' said an official, declining to be quoted
by name. ``We're not getting the bulk of them.''
   Last year, Congress reserved 4,800 visas for wealthy immigrants
from Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Young Man's Death Spurs Unique Scholarship for Homosexual Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young man's suicide in despair over
his homosexuality has led to a college scholarship in his memory,
and changed his mother's fundamentalist views.
   The $500 scholarship in memory of Bobby Griffith will be offered
beginning next year in Contra Costa County, site of an acrimonious
struggle between fundamentalists and homosexuals. It is intended to
encourage and give a sense of caring to gay students facing
prejudice and hostility, according to the organization that created
the gift.
   ``What we are saying to gay students is there is a (gay)
community out there and we care about you,'' said Rob Birle, an
Antioch High School teacher and chairman of the Contra Costa County
chapter of the Bay Area Network of Gay and Lesbian Educators.
   The scholarship, funded by donations, will be open to
heterosexual students, though preference will be given to
homosexuals.
   ``I don't know why nobody ever thought of this before,'' Birle
said. ``There are scholarships for Italians, Catholics, Hispanics
and every other kind of minority _ so why not for homosexuals?''
   Birle said he could find no similar scholarships around the
country, and the California Teachers Association said it never heard
of one, either.
   So far, 21 of the county's 23 high schools have agreed to include
the scholarship in the list they offer students.
   Opposition is expected from the Anaheim-based Stop Homosexual
Advocacy in Education group, which for more than a year has actively
opposed school programs in Contra Costa that portray homosexuality
positively.
   But the Anaheim group's activities, and Bobby's death, prompted
his mother, Mary Griffith, to give her blessing when Birle asked if
she would support the scholarship.
   ``I really believed God would come to Bobby's rescue. And when he
didn't, I had to rethink everything,'' she said Monday.
   Mrs. Griffith was initially horrified by her son's homosexuality,
which she learned of when he was 16. Within a year of his death,
Mrs. Griffith quit her church. She now is president of the Diablo
Valley Chapter of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.
   Depressed over his family and friends' disapproval, Bobby
Griffith dropped out of high school two months before he was to
graduate in 1981. He killed himself Aug. 27, 1983, in Portland, Ore.

   Heathrow Airport authorities are withdrawing 180
press passes to improve security in the wake of the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 in December.
   As of July 31, reporters, photographers and camera crews will be
barred from large areas of the airport where they had traditionally
been permitted access.
   Heathrow Airport Ltd., the airport authority, said access
generally will be restricted to essential personnel.
   ``The reason for the withdrawals is that fewer numbers means
fewer people that have to be ... searched, questioned or monitored
and greater attention can be focused on those who are airside,''
said airport spokesman Garry May. ``It is not a review of media
passes but a review of all passes.''
   May said the restrictions had nothing to do with stories
questioning airport security written by reporters who had gotten
jobs as aircraft cleaners after only minimal security checks.
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth. The question is only
one of security. It has nothing whatsoever to do with press
activities at this airport before Lockerbie or after Lockerbie,'' he
said.
   A bomb hidden inside a radio-cassette player exploded over
Scotland, killing all 259 aboard and 11 residents of Lockerbie.

<HEAD>World Bank Paying Out Old Loans to China; New Loans Blocked June
8</HEAD>

   The World Bank suspended new loans to China two
weeks ago after the bloody crackdown on demonstrators by Chinese
troops, though the bank is still paying out money on previous loans,
a spokesman said Wednesday.
   President Bush promised on Tuesday that the U.S. government would
use its voting power in the World Bank and other international
lending institutions to try to prevent new loans to China.
   Frank Vogl, chief spokesman for the bank, said that new loans
were suspended on June 8 and all but one of the bank's eight staff
members were pulled out of Beijing although some have returned.
   Sheldon Rappaport, the bank's financial spokesman, estimated that
on March 31 about $4.4 billion worth of approved loans to China had
not yet been disbursed.
   Bank President Barber Conable, a former New York congressman,
decided on June 8, shortly after the Chinese crackdown, not to
submit new loans for final approval to the 22-member Board of
Executive Directors, which meets every week in closed-door session,
representing 151 member governments.
   As the biggest shareholder, the U.S. government has just over 18
percent of the voting power and strong influence over many other
members.
   Shahid Burki, a Pakistani who heads the bank's China desk, is due
back at the bank's Washington headquarters from Beijing on Monday
with a report for Conable and the board.
   ``If economic chaos or some other reason was preventing a loan
for irrigation from being properly spent, for example, we would not
want to keep putting out the money,'' Vogl said in an interview.
   The bank lends $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year to China, the
third-largest borrower after India and Mexico.
   Pastor Sison, spokesman on Asia, calculated that $780 million
worth of new lending for China was due for approval by the board
before the bank's fiscal year ends June 30.
   The bank is planning to lend $20 billion to $21 billion this year
to over 100 Third World countries. The usual rush is on to complete
this program by the end of the fiscal year and the board has
scheduled three meetings next week.
   Sison said it would be hard to transfer to other borrowers the
amounts designated for China.
   A spokesman at the International Monetary Fund, the bank's sister
organization, said it has no loans pending or being disbursed to
China. China does get loans from the Asian Development Bank, an
international body with headquarters in Manila.

<HEAD>Embarrassed Arkansas Lawmakers Scramble to Avert Fiscal Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Red-faced legislators met in an
emergency special session Wednesday to re-pass hundreds of spending
bills that were ruled invalid because the Legislature violated a
requirement in the state's constitution.
   Virtually all state spending will halt July 1, when Arkansas'
fiscal biennium begins, unless the legislators approve nearly 300
appropriations bills all over again.
   ``I am embarrassed,'' veteran state Rep. Jodie Mahony said of the
procedural snafu during the regular session, which ended in April.
``But it is an honest mistake.''
   The special session convened late Tuesday, one day after a
specially appointed Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the General
Appropriation Act did not pass with a three-fourths majority as
required by the state's 115-year-old constitution.
   Since the General Appropriation Act must be passed before any
other spending bills may be enacted, the ruling meant the state had
not authorized a spending blueprint.
   ``The fact that our state constitution is an amalgamation of
anachronisms is no justification to ignore it,'' Arkansas Gazette
columnist John Brummett wrote Wednesday.
   During the regular legislative session, the general appropriation
bill got a 65-22 vote in the 100-member House, and a 25-9 vote in
the 35-member Senate, where 27 votes equals three-fourths.
   The House, and later a Senate Rules Committee, decided that the
general appropriation bill fell under the category of ``just
debts,'' which the constitution says is exempt from the
three-quarters rule.
   A Little Rock attorney, Sam Perroni, then filed a friendly
lawsuit challenging the General Appropriation Act's validity.
   When a Pulaski County chancellor rejected the ``just debts''
argument in ruling the appropriation act invalid, the issue went to
the state Supreme Court. However, the seven justices recused
themselves, citing a possible conflict of interest because the
legislature appropriates funds for the high court.
   A special seven-member Supreme Court was appointed that also
rejected the ``just debts'' argument, so on Monday night, Gov. Bill
Clinton's staff began rounding up lawmakers to return to Little Rock.
   The only legislators missing from the special session were a
House member who was sick and another who was out of the country.
The constitution requires that all special sessions meet for at
least three days, and Clinton said he hoped lawmakers could wrap up
things Thursday or Friday.
   To show his desire for no-nonsense action, Clinton decided
against an opening speech for the session, which is costing
taxpayers an estimated $20,000 a day.
   ``I want to do it as quickly as possible, keep it to this agenda
and finish,'' the governor said.
   Once in session, lawmakers hastily assigned bill numbers and gave
the familiar items two readings, dispatching them to the Joint
Budget Committee, where the panel's co-chairman, Rep. John E.
Miller, pressured colleagues to grind out all spending bills in a
two-hour sitting.
   ``Understand, this is a re-hash, the same thing, and all of us
know what we have done,'' Miller said. ``We're showing we're not
derelict in our duties.''
   ``It's just unfortunate we are not as good constitutional lawyers
as the Supreme Court,'' said Rep. Mike Wilson, a lawyer. ``But I
know there was a general good faith belief that it was properly
passed.''
   The court ruling also invalidated an unpopular $119 million,
10-year settlement of state liability in desegregation lawsuits
surrounding schools in Little Rock's Pulaski County. The settlement
passed by a narrow margin the first time around, and opponents say
they won't let it pass again.
   Sen. Stanley Russ, a member of the Joint Budget Committee, which
recommended the settlement bill for passage Wednesday, predicted the
bill would pass the Senate but die in the House.

<HEAD>FBI Calls Violent Crime a Top Priority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is making violent crime a nationwide
investigative priority to counter a 40 percent increase in such
offenses in the 1980s, Director William S. Sessions said Wednesday.
   Sessions told reporters that violent crime will rank with foreign
counterintelligence, terrorism, drugs, organized crime and white
collar crime as major priorities of the FBI.
   ``With the acknowledged 40 percent increase in violent crime, the
American public is understandably outraged by the growing disregard
for human life by criminals,'' Sessions said.
   While state and local police still have jurisdiction to
investigate the vast majority of violent crimes, Sessions said the
FBI can expand its role in this area.
   For example, recently enacted legislation gives the FBI expanded
jurisdiction to investigate the killings of all state and local law
police officers. The FBI also has new jurisdiction under the drug
law passed by Congress last year to investigate murders related to
drug trafficking.
   In the past, violent crime ``did not receive as I believe, the
kind of emphasis is should receive,'' Sessions said.
   The new priority status of violent crimes ``will be certain to
get the attention of SACs (special agents in charge) out there in
the field who are allocating resources to the particular
responsibilities,'' Sessions said.
   The amount of time agents have spent investigating violent crime
has dropped ``because of the other priorities that we have
established. I anticipate this will hold the line in any reduction
in those numbers,'' Sessions said.
   President Bush has asked Congress to appropriate $19.5 million to
hire 300 new FBI agents as part of his anti-crime package. If
approved, ``we expect to apply those resources directly to the
violent crime problem,'' Sessions said.
   Sessions meanwhile, declined to say he was strongly confident
that the FBI would find those responsible for the March 10 bombing
of a van in San Diego driven by the wife of the capital of the USS
Vincennes.
   ``I can't express with strong confidence we will solve that
particular crime but I hope we will be able to do it,'' Sessions
said.
   The blast did not injure Sharon Rogers, the wife of Capt. Will
Rogers III, whose ship mistakenly shot down an Iranian jetliner in
the Persian Gulf last summer.
   By contrast, Sessions said he remained confident that
investigators would solve the Dec. 29 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland that killed all 259 persons.
   The bombing is believed to be in retaliation for the U.S. downing
of the Iranian jetliner that was carrying 290 people.
   Sessions, meanwhile, acknowledged there ``may have been a lapse''
in communications when Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was not
notified that FBI agents planned to interview Rep. William H. Gray
III, D-Pa., on Memorial Day.
   The Memorial Day visit resulted in stories that the FBI was
investigating an allegation of payroll padding on Gray's
congressional staff. The Justice Department has since said Gray is
not a target of the investigation but is cooperating.
   Last week, Thornburgh's chief spokesman, David Runkel, said that
the attorney general should have been informed in advance of the FBI
interview.
   Sessions said ``it is one of those things'' of which Thornburgh
should have been aware. ``To me it's very important that he be aware
of those things that are problematic,'' Sessions said.
   ``We try to have keep him informed,'' Sessions said. ``I have no
rationale or excuse to make in that connection.''
   But the director said ``I don't think there was a breakdown in
communications, I think there may have been a lapse there may have
been some circumstances where communication was not fully conveyed.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets with Lawmakers on Steel Import Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of steel import restraints told
President Bush on Wednesday that he should not feel bound by a
campaign pledge to renew the trade barriers.
   ``(Winston) Churchill used to say, `I'd rather be right than be
consistent,' and I reminded the president of that,'' Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, told reporters after the meeting at the White House
regarding the import curbs that expire Sept. 30.
   Bush met privately with lawmakers who favor extending the trade
program and with Gramm and others who are urging it be dropped.
   Bush ``tipped his hand in no direction whatsoever,'' said Sen.
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus.
   The Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with
Japan, South Korea, the European Community, Brazil and other nations
to limit the flow of foreign steel into the United States.
   Three days before last November's election, Bush wrote a letter
to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., pledging to renew the program in some
form. But with the steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the
curbs say they can make a case for Bush to end the barriers or at
least narrow their scope.
   ``We'd like to think his normal inclination would be on the side
of fewer barriers,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., told reporters after
the meeting. ``What he's going to do with that statement that he
made in Pennsylvania toward the end of the campaign, I don't know.
But I suppose I could live with a compromise.''
   ``Everything is different than it was in 1984,'' Gramm said.
``The industry is operating at 96 percent of capacity, steel prices
are rising very rapidly now, especially for the smaller fabricators
who do not have long-term agreements with the domestic steel
industry. The steel industry is profitable.''
   Advocates of continuing the program argue that steel price hikes
have been caused not by import barriers but by strong worldwide
demand and shifting exchange rates.
   The trade conditions that spawned the restraint program still
exist, Rockefeller said.
   ``America is playing by the right rules and everybody else is
playing by protectionism, and we get hurt,'' Rockefeller said.
   He said the program must be extended ``so the steel industry can
complete about another $10 billion of modernization that they have
to complete in order to be competitive with the rest of world, which
is already subsidizing and dumping in United States.''
   The administration has not said when a decision will be made, but
Heinz said he expected something in the next several weeks. Heinz
and Rockefeller said they attended the meeting on behalf of steel
companies and steelworkers pressing for a five-year renewal of the
program.

   A political battle royal has begun in
South Florida's 18th congressional district as 16 candidates vie for

   Three others entered as write-in candidates.
   Pepper, a liberal Democrat who died May 30, held the seat since
its inception in 1962, despite the district's increasingly
conservative, Hispanic makeup. Republicans hold a 10-8 edge in
Florida's House delegation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists and 61 members of Congress
said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Interior should sue Exxon
Corp. for damage caused to public land as a result of the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
   Rep. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., led the delegation in its
request that litigation be initiated against the companies
responsible for the March 24 oil spill in Alaska's Prince William
Sound, the largest oil spill in history.
   ``My interest is not simple vengeance. It is rather providing the
only genuine incentive that will ever prevent the repetition of the
Valdez tragedy,'' Torricelli said at a news conference.
   ``If the message to international oil companies is that 11
million gallons of oil can destroy hundreds of miles of pristine
shore and thousands of birds and animals and cost no more than a few
months' operating profit, then we have no guarantees for the
future,'' Torricelli said.
   Torricelli's letter, addressed to Secretary of the Interior
Manuel Lujan Jr., asks that department, the Department of Justice
and other federal agencies to pursue legal action against Exxon and
the Alyeska Pipeline Service.
   A dozen environmental groups, including the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society and the
National Wildlife Federation, sought the same action in a separate
letter to President Bush.
   ``This is a key issue to determine if the federal government is
at all serious about the environment,'' said Michael McClosky,
chairman of the Sierra Club. ``The guilty party should bear these
costs, not the government.''
   Also Wednesday, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., pleaded for a law that
would deny Exxon a tax writeoff for expenses of cleaning up the
spill.
   Reid is chief sponsor of a bill that would prohibit Exxon from
deducting costs of cleaning up the spill unless the federal
government certified the clean up meets standards of the Clean Water
Act or other federal laws.

   Israeli warplanes destroyed the
headquarters of a dissident Palestinian guerrilla faction Wednesday,
and the guerrillas reported one fighter killed and six wounded.
   Palls of dust and smoke billowed from the oak woods around
Naameh, 10 miles south of Beirut, as guerrillas opened up with
anti-aircraft guns on fighter-bombers that dived from clear skies.
   The jets released scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking
missiles.
   Guerrillas launched one SA-7, but the Soviet-made projectile
missed its target.
   Police said four warplanes struck two positions of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the bluffs
of Naameh.
   A police spokesman said eight guerrillas were wounded.
   A statement from the guerrillas' headquarters in Damascus
reported one guerrilla killed and six wounded.
   It said the raid lasted 105 minutes, during which nine formations
of U.S.-built F-4 Phantom and Skyhawk bombers dropped more than 100
rockets.
   The statement said guerrillas prevented several attempts to land
airborne and seaborne commandos in the area, where they maintain
bases in a chain of tunnels across the Naameh hills.
   Israeli gunboats were cruising the Mediterranean and two
helicopter gunships hovered over the beaches, but reporters saw no
attempt to land troops.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said its planes returned safely
from an attack on targets that ``served as the headquarters for
Ahmed Jibril.''
   It was the third air raid on Lebanon this week and the ninth this
year.
   On Friday, Israeli warplanes bombed south Lebanon's Rashidiyeh
refugee camp, wounding two children.
   By police count, nine people have been killed and 60 wounded in
the eight other air strikes.
   Jibril, a former Syrian army captain, is leader of the
Libyan-financed faction that has been at odds with Yasser Arafat's
mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization for six years.
   Another guerrilla group, George Habash's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said its Naameh base was hit, but gave no
details of damage or casualties.
   Habash's organization, the second-largest of the nine PLO
factions after Arafat's Fatah, pledged in a statement to ``continue
the painful raids against the Zionist enemy.''
   The Lebanese spokesman could confirm only the hits on Jibril's
bases.
   He said four of the rockets struck the entrance to a tunnel and
10 others devastated a base near a deserted monastery.
   A Palestinian guerrilla source said on condition of anonymity
that the attack ``inflicted severe damage on the base near the
monastery, but the tunnel was not affected.''
   The base is only 500 yards east of the highway linking Beirut
with south Lebanon.
   Panicking motorists deserted their vehicles and ran for cover in
banana groves. Swimmers hurried to a nearby motel.
   But Naameh residents, accustomed to Israeli attacks, climbed to
rooftops to watch the planes.
   Lebanese militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt blocked roads
and fired automatic rifles in the air to keep reporters and
photographers from stricken targets.
   The Naameh bluffs were the scene of a nine-hour confrontation
between Jibril's fighters and Israeli air, naval and ground forces
Dec. 9. Eight guerrillas and an Israeli officer were killed.
   Jibril said after that battle the helicopter-borne paratroopers
released dogs fitted with tear gas containers and explosives to
chase his fighters across the tunnels.

   McLynn, an engineering student whose goal is to become a toy
designer, won an MTV giveaway of the Batmobile used in the movie
``Batman.'' He is to collect his prize at a theater Friday from
actor Robert Wuhl, who plays a reporter in the movie.
   McLynn is working his way through Virginia Commonwealth
University by tending bar part time and doesn't own a car, but he's
not sure what he'll do with the Batmobile.
   It's 20 feet long and more than 11 feet wide, and the engine has
been removed for safety reasons.
   ``The car was the real prop used in the picture. But its motor
was too heavy, the ratio wasn't according to regulations. It has
only been driven by stunt men,'' said Greg Drebin, an MTV publicist.
   Luckily for McLynn, the prize also includes $25,000 for bat-gas.
He said he will invest the money in certificates of deposit and use
the interest to buy a motorcycle.

<HEAD>Ultra-Right Aims at Federal Parliament</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ultra-right party that made a
strong showing in voting for the European Parliament is aiming for
the federal Parliament, aided by millions of dollars in government
campaign funds.
   The Republicans, headed by a former Waffen SS soldier, have
tapped an ultraconservative vein with strong nationalistic appeals
and demands to virtually bury the Nazi past.
   The Republicans won 7.1 percent of the vote and six seats in
Sunday's balloting for the European Parliament. It was their first
nationwide test.
   ``The party has automatically improved its chances for the next
elections,'' said West German pollster Wolfgang G. Gibowski.
``Nothing succeeds like success.''
   Gibowskia, a director of the independent Forschungsgruppe Wahlen
polling organization of Mannheim, added, ``A party that shows at the
first shot it can get more than 5 percent of the vote will no longer
be subject to doubts among voters about whether they're wasting
their ballot by voting for it.''
   Five percent of the vote is the minimum needed for a party to
gain seats in the Bonn Parliament, and many people are predicting
the Republicans will succeed during national voting in December 1990.
   The Republicans will receive $8.2 million in campaign funds
allotted by the government to various political parties.
   Founded in 1983, the Republicans came to prominence in city
elections in January in West Berlin, gaining 7.5 percent of the vote
and 11 seats in the city legislature. They ran on a platform to rid
the city of foreign workers.
   Later, the Republicans picked up support in the few races where
they fielded candidates in municipal elections in Hesse state.
   Franz Schoenhuber, the former SS soldier who heads the
Republicans, told thousands of cheering supporters in February that
young Germans should be absolved of guilt for the Holocaust.
   ``Today's young generation of Germans is no more guilty for
Auschwitz than the sons and daughters of Americans who committed
genocide at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,'' Schoenhuber said.
   Schoenhuber, who claims the party has 16,000 members, has also
railed against the Common Market as a threat to West German national
interests and made strong law-and-order appeals that reportedly have
gained support among police groups.
   There have been clashes between left-wing demonstrators and
police guarding Republican rallies.
   Some critics accuse the Republicans of having neo-Nazi
tendencies. Federal officials have refused to call them right-wing
``extremists,'' which include various neo-Nazi groups.
   Heinz Galinski, the leader of West Germany's Jewish community,
predicts the Republicans will win 5 percent of the vote next year
and sit in Parliament.
   ``The success of the Republicans is not temporary,'' Galinski, a
76-year-old survivor of Auschwitz, told The Associated Press. ``We
must figure in the future on having a further increase in the
radical right-wing.''
   Since Sunday's voting for the European Parliament, one main issue
has been whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian
Democrats would form a coalition with the Republicans to stay in
power following the 1990 voting.
   Kohl rejects the idea. Schoenhuber denies he wants to work with
Kohl's party but says he has had contacts in that direction from the
Chrisitan Democratic Party's more conservative Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union.
   ``We're in the happy position of being the courted bride and not
the flirtatious bridegroom,'' Schoenhuber said Monday in summing up
his view of where the party stands.
   Republican leaders also have announced they plan to move the
party headquarters from Munich to Bonn to increase their profile,
while saying they will run in numerous state and local races before
the 1990 national voting.
   Among the leftist politicians worried by the Republicans' high
profile is Gerhard Schroeder, head of the opposition Social
Democratic Party in the Lower Saxony state parliament.
   He blamed Kohl's party for reviving hopes for the reunification
of West Germany and East Germany, especially during the recent visit
of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. That, according to
Schroeder, fueled the Republicans' own strident demands for
reunification.
   ``That is an appeal to national feelings that has nothing to do
with reality,'' Schroeder said. ``That's a chance for the
Republicans. They thrive on that hope.''
   Schroeder has called for a united front involving political
parties, churches and labor unions to carry out a campaign to halt
the Republicans. He wants to target young people in particular to
educate them about the ultra-right.

<HEAD>Sub's Sonar Sub Didn't Spot Tugboat, Investigator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear submarine that snagged a
towing cable and dragged a tugboat under, killing a deckhand, had
failed to detect the 97-ton vessel by sonar, a federal investigator
says.
   The analysis by National Transportation Safety Board investigator
Donald Tyrell is based on interviews with the crew of the USS
Houston after the accident June 14.
   Tyrell, in an interview in Wednesday's Long Beach Press-Telegram,
said the tug's engine noises may have been masked by the sounds of
larger ships in the area, or the sub may have been in a spot where
it couldn't pick up the tug's sounds.
   Requests for Navy comment were referred to Lt. Sonja Hedley at
the sub's home port in San Diego, and she wasn't immediately
available.
   According to Tyrell, the 360-foot sub was relying on ``passive''
sonar, which allows tracking of vessels by engine and other noises.
This is normal for military subs, Tyrell said, noting that active
sonar, which emits ``pings'' that bounce back and locate vessels
more accurately, give away a sub's position.
   The Houston snagged the submerged cable linking the 73-foot tug
to two barges. Two crewmen swam to safety in the early-morning fog,
but a deckhand was lost.
   Shortly before the accident, the sub had helped in filming of the
movie ``The Hunt for Red October.''

<HEAD>Prepare New Drive for Wayne Williams in Atlanta Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a decade after the first of the ``child
murder'' victims was found, lawyers for Wayne Williams are headed
back to court to try to show that the Ku Klux Klan, not Williams,
was responsible for the deaths.
   From July 1979 to May 1981, 29 poor, generally street-wise young
blacks were found killed in and around Atlanta. One other is missing.
   Williams, now 30, was convicted in 1982 of two of the deaths and
is serving two life sentences. Authorities attributed 22 other
killings to him. The other cases remain classified as unsolved.
   New York civil rights lawyer William Kuntsler said he and others
working on Williams' case will meet Tuesday in Atlanta to organize
what he called ``the final thrust'' of their appeal and to request a
new evidentiary hearing.
   ``We've been collecting more and more information, all of which
points to Wayne's innocence,'' he said Wednesday from his New York
office.
   The prosecution has contended since Williams was convicted that
the evidence points to him and to nobody else. But doubt has
remained in the minds of many, including the parents of some
victims, over whether Williams was behind all of the killings or
acted alone.
   The Georgia Supreme Court unanimously rejected an initial appeal
of Williams' conviction in 1983 and later voted 6-1 not to
reconsider.
   In November 1985, Kuntsler and others on the defense team
appealed in Butts County Superior Court in Jackson, where Williams
is imprisoned, claiming authorities withheld vital information from
the defense that might have exonerated the former freelance
photographer and music promoter.
   Since then, the case has remained dormant while defense attorneys
sought information to support their contention.
   ``What we have put together is the fact that there was a meeting
in the governor's office in which it was decided that they could not
charge a white Klan member without causing a race riot,'' Kuntsler
contended. ``Wayne became the fall guy. Everything we have sustains
that.''
   George Busbee was governor at the time. His secretary said he
could not immediately comment Wednesday because he was in meetings.
   Kuntsler said investigators have amassed more than 300 pages of
new evidence that points away from Williams.
   ``We have as much as we're going to get,'' he said. ``We're going
to reopen this case and get Wayne out of there and go after the
Klan.''
   Among evidence withheld, he contends, are wiretap recordings in
which Klan members admit ``that they did it and they boasted about
it.''
   Lewis Slaton, district attorney for Fulton County where most of
the killings took place, said he was aware of ``nothing new'' in the
case and added that the move appears to be a continuation of the
appeal previously filed.
   Williams was convicted largely on the basis of fibers found on
the victims that could be traced to the Williams household carpet,
Williams' bedspread, his dog and other sources.
   Prosecution witnesses testified that the odds of random
duplication of that combination of fibers were 150 million to one.
   Joseph Drolet of the Fulton County district attorney's office,
who prosecuted the case, said fiber evidence linked Williams to
about 20 of the cases and the same fiber combination has not been
found on a murder victim since Williams was arrested. Some victims
were found in rivers or on river banks and were washed clean of
evidence, he said.

<HEAD>Young Americans Urged to Help Rescue Those ``Free Falling Through
Society''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a clarion call to community
service, urged young Americans on Wednesday to help rescue millions
of homeless, poor and other needy people who are ``free falling
through society.''
   ``I need your help. ... America needs your help,'' Bush told more
than 3,000 teen-agers and children on the White House lawn.
   ``It is a time of need for millions of Americans,'' said Bush.
``Too many people are free falling through society with no prospect
of landing on their feet.
   ``No one _ young, old, white, brown or black _ should be
permitted to go through life unclaimed,'' said Bush. ``You must show
us how to reclaim these lives.''
   He made his appeal as part of his Youth Engaged in Service (YES)
to America drive to muster support for community service.
   In New York on Thursday, he will unveil details of a wider
national service initiative ``to encourage volunteers of all ages,
all backgrounds, all abilities,'' Bush said.
   Aides said Bush would urge virtually every institution in society
to give a new push to volunteerism.
   But on this steamy morning, he aimed his message at the young,
from 5 to 25, saying all had something to give.
   Bush invoked the image of the bell in the church steeple that in
``a simpler time'' summoned neighbors to help.
   ``When people heard that bell, they didn't stop to ask why it was
ringing, they just came, (on) horseback or foot, by buggy or
bicycle, honking the horn of a Model T, they just came,'' said the
president. ``Whatever the problem, whoever was in need of help, they
were ready.''
   ``The bells have been silent too long,'' he said. ``Let them ring
in your hearts and across the land.''
   ``Commit yourselves. Listen to the bells. Make it your mission to
make a difference in somebody else's life,'' he said.
   ``All of you have something to offer _ kids from tough
neighborhoods, kids from broken homes, kids who have grown up on
food stamps and hand-me-downs. ... You each have a gift that America
needs,'' he said.
   His remarks hit a receptive chord in the audience, invited from
Boy Scout troops, church groups, schools and other organizations
already engaged in service.
   ``He's preaching to the converted in my case,'' said Alexandra
Warren, 19, of New Hope, Pa., who is spending this summer as a
volunteer for Common Cause before her junior year at Haverford
College. Service ``is part of the Quaker ethos at Haverford,'' she
said.
   Shaka Brown, 12, a Boy Scout from Washington, D.C., said, ``I
just helped somebody a little while ago. A young lady lost her
nametag.'' He helped her find it on the soggy and packed White House
lawn.
   As presidents in time of war called for young people to defend
America, Bush said he was urging them to fight poverty, homelessness
and other ills.
   He told Congress in February he will seek $100 million over four
years to endow a YES foundation to provide matching grants for
community service projects.
   Bush said young people could find meaning and adventure in
community service.
   He listed sad statistics about America's youth _ 1,700 drop out
of school, 4,000 run away from home and 2,700 become pregnant daily
_ but he insisted: ``You're not the problem. You are the solution.''
   ``You don't need to be bribed with incentives and threatened with
penalties to get engaged in community service,'' he said. ``Service
is its own reward, satisfaction guaranteed.''
   ``He wants to save money,'' said June Shih, 17, of St. Agnes
School in Alexandria, Va., where the girls are required to perform
40 hours of community service before senior year.
   ``It's good, the 1,000 points of light and everything,'' said
Shih, a Red Cross volunteer. ``America's in the red. He has to find
some way to help the less-fortunate without straining the budget.''

<TEXT>
   Namibia's administrator Wednesday
refused to dismiss paramilitary policemen who have been accused of
intimidating civilians and jeopardizing independence elections in
the territory.
   South African Administrator Louis Pienaar told a news conference
he will allow members of the recently disbanded Koevoet
counterinsurgency unit to remain in the regular police force.
   Members of Koevoet, which means ``crowbar'' in Afrikaans, wore
military uniforms and traveled the bush in armored personnel
carriers. They are known for often brutal tactics against supporters
and guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization, which
has fought 23 years to end South African rule of Namibia.
   Koevoet was made up mostly of black Namibians led by white South
Africans.
   Pretoria, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, has agreed to a
yearlong transition to independence supervised by more than 4,000
U.N. monitors.
   Both the United Nations and South-West Africa People's
Organization accuse ex-Koevoet members of continuing to harass
civilians since their January integration into the regular police
force.
   ``Their activities appear to have createad an atmosphere of fear
and intimidation among much of the population in the northern
region,'' Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N. special representative to
Namibia, said in a June 9 letter to Pienaar.
   ``In my opinion, (they are) unfit for continued service in the
police during the transition period in view of the need to ensure
the necessary conditions for free and fair elecations,'' the letter
said.
   Pienaar said he has reports guerrillas are storing arms caches in
northern Namibia and he cannot afford to reduce the police strength.
   ``We feel obliged to maintain a state of alertness, commensurate
with a potential threat to the security of the region,'' he said.
   ``I reject the possibility that men should be removed from the
police just because they have been members of the counterinsurgency
unit.''
   He emphasized he would dismiss individuals found guilty of
misconduct.
   Ahtisaari and Pienaar met Wednesday to discuss the intimidation
charges and plan more talks, officials said.
   In other developments, U.N. officials said 5,621 Namibian exiles
have been flown home since they began a repatriation campaign 10
days ago. The U.N. has registered more than 41,000 Namibian refugees
at camps in neighboring Angola, Zambia and Botswana and wants to
bring back 1,000 a day for six weeks.
   South Africa agreed to grant Namibia independence in exchange for
the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops helping Angola's government
fight U.S.-backed rebels.

<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said
Wednesday an African summit aimed at resolving the Angolan civil war
will fail unless direct talks begin between the rebels and the
government.
   But he told a news conference at his bush camp that ``never in 14
years of war have we come so close'' to peace.
   Angola's official news agency announced Wednesday the government
released 700 rebel prisoners. The dispatch said the prisoners were
released June 2 and reported the prisoners had renounced the rebel
movement and accepted the government's offer of clemency.
   The announcement came on the eve of a meeting of African leaders
in Gbadolite, Zaire. The meeting could clear the way for direct
peace talks between Angola's Marxist government and the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Savimbi said his delegation in Zaire was willing to be flexible
about procedures leading to elections and formation of a national
unity government.
   But, he said, the rebels would reject any amnesty or clemency for
the guerrillas.
   ``Our army, 75,000 men in the field, will not accept amnesty,
clemency or integration'' into the ruling Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola, Savimbi said. ``That wording has a political
context that means (the rebel army) is considered criminal. Our army
was not defeated and is not going to be defeated.''
   Savimbi said he has agreed to stay out of the negotiations and
will not demand a role in any transitional government. But he said
he would remain the head of his party. He also wants to participate
in free elections he anticipates within two years of a formal
cease-fire.
   He dismissed reports he might go into exile, saying he would
remain in Angola after a cease-fire, but not necessarily in his
southeastern stronghold of Jamba.
   Angola's government has rejected elections, insisting on
maintaining one-party rule and offering some rebels positions in the
administration.
   The Angolan news service ANGOP said Wednesday that President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos' has a peace plan calling for Savimbi to go
abroad, recognize the legitimacy of the government and for the rebel
movement to be integrated into the one-party state. Savimbi
vehemently vetoed all these proposals at his news conference.
   Savimbi said the Angolan government was under pressure, because
within six months, half of the 50,000 Cuban soldiers who have
supported it will have left Angola under a U.S.-mediated southern
African peace agreement reached in December.
   The Cubans have agreed to a gradual withdrawal, to be completed
by July 1991. But Savimbi said the Soviet Union and the United
States have promised to ``help the Cubans leave quickly'' if the
peace talks lead to formation of a transitional unity government
before then.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war to
force the Cuban- and Soviet-assisted government to share power since
shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Savimbi praised Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko for organizing
the summit, expected to be attended by leaders from Zaire, Angola,
Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome e Principe,
Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Congo and
Mali.
   According to news reports in Portugal, Savimbi might also travel
to Zaire to participate in the indirect talks. Savimbi was preparing
to fly out of Angola after the news conference Wednesday but did not
say where he was going.
   At the request of Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny,
the rebels have declared a ``de facto'' cease-fire and are
conducting only defensive operations. He said the government army is
still attacking, ``trying to capture prisoners for their amnesty,''
but with much less intensity than in the past.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Raises Possibility of Child Care Veto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday raised the
prospect that a child-care package being pushed by the Senate's
Democratic leadership would be vetoed and Republicans sought support
for an alternative the White House supports.
   The specter of a veto was raised in an administration policy
statement distributed on Capitol Hill as the Senate debated the
issue for a fifth day. At the White House, however, a spokesman said
President Bush still hoped to reach agreement with Congress on a
plan.
   In the three-page policy statement, the administration said the
child-care package being advocated by Democratic leaders with the
help of one leading GOP senator, Orrin Hatch of Utah, ``is
fundamentally flawed'' and that if it reached the White House Bush's
``senior advisers would recommend that he veto it.''
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was less direct when asked
whether Bush would veto the legislation if it clears Congress as it
stands now.
   Fitzwater said the administration believed its tax credit
proposal was the best approach to helping low-income parents pay for
child care but was ``willing to talk about alternatives and how this
could be approved.''
   The legislation before the Senate is a revised version of the Act
for Better Child Care sponsored by Hatch and Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn. It authorizes $1.75 billion to be spent on child care in
fiscal 1990 through subsidies to parents and states to help pay for
child care and expand its availability.
   States would be required to give 70 percent of the money directly
to low-income families for child care expenses, with the rest used
to fund and administer state programs designed to improve the
quality and quantity of child care.
   Tacked on to the measure is a package of tax credits designed to
help parents offset the costs of child care and health insurance.
Those credits, endorsed by the Senate Finance Committee, are similar
to the credits at the heart of the alternative package being offered
by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas with the support of
the White House.
   But Dole and other GOP lawmakers have virtually ignored the
tax-credit provisions of the revised Dodd-Hatch plan and focused
their attacks on the subsidy provisions of the measure, which they
contend give too much control of the money to state governments and
not enough to parents.
   The alternative Republican plan includes an expansion of the
existing earned-income tax credit for parents with children under
age 5 and a proposal to provide money up front to low-income
families who cannot take advantage of the dependent-care credit
because their incomes are so low they do not pay taxes.
   The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to kill the
Democratic leadership plan in favor of the GOP approach.
   Republicans have been lobbying Southern Democrats in hope of
winning enough support for their package, but the Democratic
leadership says it has the votes to quash the GOP effort.

<TEXT>
   Burma's main opposition leader and 15
supporters were detained Wednesday during a ceremony to honor people
slain last year during a military crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators, official sources said.
   The sources said Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers were
interrogated for about an hour and then released. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No official statement was made about the incident at Myeinigon,
four miles north of downtown Rangoon.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the incident would be a ``grave blow to hopes that next year's
election will be free and fair.''
   Boucher said the administration has noted with concern the
Burmese government's restrictions on political activity, including a
ban on gatherings of five or more people, prohibition of opposition
publications and harassment and arrest of opposition party leaders.
   Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of deceased national hero Gen.
Aung San. A 44-year-old political neophyte, she is widely regarded
as the most powerful opposition figure in Burma. Her party appears
to have the biggest backing among the more than 200 that have
mushroomed since last year's pro-democracy movement.
   She held a religious ceremony with her followers at a branch
office of her National League for Democracy and then walked to the
spot where several demonstrators were shot by police last June 21.
   Several hundred people were present at the wreath-laying when
authorities moved in.
   Witnesses said Aung San Suu Kyi and the others were taken away in
open military trucks to a government office near where the ceremony
took place.
   In recent months, Aung San Suu Kyi has been harassed on occasion
but generally been given considerable leeway by the military
government to campaign throughout the country.
   She returned to Rangoon from London, her home for many years, to
look after her ailing mother in April 1988, and became embroiled in
political turmoil sweeping Burma at the time.
   She became one of the main leaders of a pro-democracy uprising
that seemed on the verge of toppling 26 years of authoritarian rule
through massive street demonstrations.
   But in September, Gen. Saw Maung and a group of military officers
brutally crushed the student-led protests and clamped martial law on
the country.
   The new leaders allowed the formation of opposition political
parties and have promised free general elections next year.
   Aung San Suu Kyi joined with two popular leaders, retired Brig.
Gen. Aung Gyi and former Defense Minister Tin Oo, to form the
National League for Democracy. Aung Gyi later left the group,
claiming the league was being infiltrated by communists.

   Britons walked, cycled, hitchhiked, shared cars or
simply stayed home Wednesday as a one-day strike idled the national
railroads and London's buses and subways.
   It was believed to be the first triple-barreled transport action
since the 1926 general strike, according to British Rail and London
Underground.
   Careful planning and bright skies made it less nightmarish than
commuters expected, however.
   London hotels were full of employees spending the night in the
city to beat the strike. Many companies hired fleets of buses, and
Thames River passenger ferries reported business was booming.
   Some judges at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court spent the
night in their offices, and hundreds of judges, lawyers and jurors
walked or cycled, enabling 17 of the 19 courtrooms to function
normally. An early shortage of stenographers forced some judges to
take their own notes as hearings got under way.
   Senior prosecutor John Bevan cycled for several miles through
slow-moving traffic, carrying his gown in a bag on his back, and he
said he wouldn't like to repeat the experience.
   ``My nerves are shattered,'' he said. ``It really is a most
dangerous occupation.''
   ``I saw a car with three bikes on the roof, two in the back, and
five people in the car. I guess they just drive as far as they can
and get on their bikes,'' said Patrick Gilligan of London Bicycle Co.
   Forewarned by police to drive only if necessary, motorists set
out two or three hours early. ``Traffic was in fact quieter than
normal on most of the motorway routes around London,'' said the
Automobile Association.
   Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow also reported
earlier rush hours, with traffic little worse than normal.
   ``It looks as if motorists have been sensible, going in earlier
and car-sharing,'' said the AA in Glasgow.
   London parking garages were packed, and police refused to ease
parking restrictions, saying it would encourage more people to drive
into the capital. However, free parking was set aside for buses
bringing in commuters.
   Evangelist Billy Graham also laid on extra free parking at
Crystal Palace in south London, where he was preaching Wednesday
night.
   Overcoming traditional English reserve, many suburbanites shared
cars or were seen hitchhiking to work.
   Travelers using London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports were urged
to use buses rather than taxis. Gatwick's express train to central
London was idled, as was the subway line to Heathrow.
   On strike were 75,000 rail workers, 18,500 operators of London's
red double-decker buses and 10,500 subway workers, leaving only some
private suburban bus routes operating in London.
   It was the seventh subway strike in London in 11 weeks, but only
the first by rail workers since 1982. London's buses and subway
system carry more than 3 million passengers a day and British Rail's
national network carries 2 million daily.
   The rail unions are rejecting state-owned British Rail's offer of
a 7 percent wage increase, and their tempers have been inflamed by
the employer's unsuccessful attempts to block the strike in the
courts.
   The National Union of Railwaymen says it scrupulously followed
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's union-curbing laws, which require
unions to poll their members secretly and obtain a 55 percent
majority for a walkout.
   The bus workers have rejected an increase of 8 percent or 9
percent and want 14 percent. The subway workers want a $99 weekly
increase to operate without a guard. Management is offering $46 plus
14 days extra annual vacation, but is tying the raise to increased
productivity.
   Mrs. Thatcher, displaying her deep dislike for the unions that
dominated British life until her Conservative Party took office in
1979, on Tuesday denounced the railway workers as ``typically
selfish ... deliberately causing massive inconvenience to those who
have to work.''
   The transport strikes, coupled with a surge in inflation to 8.3
percent and interest rates at 14 percent, have taken some of the
shine off Britain's economic recovery under Mrs. Thatcher, and are
seen as one of the reasons for the rout of the Tories in last week's
elections to the European Parliament.

<HEAD>Former Chief Justice, Speaker Brought Down By Mob Ties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Joseph A. Bevilacqua, whose lifelong
friendships with reputed mobsters tarnished and eventually ended his
career as Rhode Island's top legislator and top judge, died
Wednesday. He was 70.
   Bevilacqua died at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. No
further information was immediately available, said hospital
spokeswoman Brenda Buratti.
   He had been hospitalized several times during the last few months
in Providence, most recently in early May for a heart attack. He was
taken to Brigham and Women's on May 30 when he complained of
problems with his medication, relatives said.
   Bevilacqua was elected to the Rhode Island House in 1954 and
maintained a successful criminal law practice while he rose through
the ranks to become majority leader in 1966 and speaker in 1969.
   Questions about his ties to criminals came into the open when the
General Assembly elected him chief justice of the state Supreme
Court in 1976.
   Among them were allegations that Bevilacqua had harbored a
fugitive from a 1963 department store robbery and accepted $2,000 of
the loot from him. The fugitive, Robert Northrop, later recanted his
story.
   Then-Attorney General Julius Michaelson investigated the matter
in 1977 but concluded there was ``no prosecutable case.''
   At about the same time, a letter surfaced in which Bevilacqua
told the state Parole Board in 1973 that Raymond L.S. Patriarca, the
late New England organized-crime boss, was ``a person of integrity
and, in my opinion, good moral character.''
   The Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline took no action
after it investigated the letter and Bevilacqua's officiating at the
the wedding of Patriarca's chauffeur six months after becoming chief
justice. The chauffeur, Joseph A. Badway, was under indictment for
fraud at the time.
   The series of events that finally brought Bevilacqua down began
at the end of 1984, with a Providence Journal-Bulletin story
alleging that state police and the newspaper's reporters had
observed Bevilacqua repeatedly visiting the homes of underworld
figures.
   The state police subsequently alleged that Bevilacqua had also
visited a Smithfield motel, owned by men linked to gambling and
drugs, for trysts with his secretary and another woman to whom he
was not married.
   The judicial commission launched a new investigation, hiring
former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg as special
counsel, and censured Bevilacqua for associating with criminals.
Bevilacqua agreed to take an unpaid four-month leave of absence in
1985.
   When the General Assembly convened the next year, it launched
impeachment proceedings. Two weeks after the House Judiciary
Committee began public hearings on the matter, Bevilacqua resigned.
   In February 1987, U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond confirmed that
Bevilacqua's personal finances were under investigation.
   At the time Bevilacqua stepped down, the impeachment hearings had
begun to focus on his personal finances, which he handled in cash
and through third parties.
   He is survived by his wife, two sons and daughter.
   Funeral plans were incomplete.

   A robber who shot a convenience store
clerk to death was executed Wednesday in Mississippi's gas chamber,
insisting to the last that he was convicted unfairly because of
racial discrimination.
   A doctor at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman said
Leo Edwards Jr., 36, of New Orleans was heavily sedated at his own
request. But the lethal fumes awakened him and he cried out and
gasped before he died at 12:15 a.m.
   Edwards was the fourth person executed at the Mississippi
penitentiary and the 113th in the nation since the U.S. Supreme
Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
   He was executed for the shooting death of Jackson convenience
store clerk Linzy Don Dixon in a June 14, 1980, robbery that netted
$111. Dixon was shot while he talked on the telephone.
   Edwards, who was black, was convicted by an all-white Hinds
County Circuit Court jury and was sentenced to death April 1, 1981.
Defense attorneys protested that prosecutors deliberately excluded
blacks from the jury, but four appeals courts disagreed.
   Edwards maintained again in a Memphis, Tenn., newspaper interview
published Tuesday that he did not receive a fair trial, recalling
that when he saw the all-white jury he said, ``I'm dead.''
   Late Tuesday, Gov. Ray Mabus rejected a plea for clemency.
   ``I will not stand in the way of the courts' justice. ... Leo
Edwards is a mass murderer who killed in cold blood,'' Mabus said.
``He tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the courts, and
discrimination had no bearing in his case.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused, in a 7-2 vote, to delay the
execution on procedural grounds.
   Dixon, who also was black, was killed during a five-day robbery
spree by Edwards and co-defendant Mike White that left three people
dead and one wounded. White, who got three life terms, testified
that Edwards told him he had shot the store clerk to avoid being
identified later.
   Before his execution, family members including his mother and
daughter spent most of the day with Edwards. He also talked with a
priest.

<HEAD>Criminal Charges Dropped Against Interns Who Went on Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said Wednesday they have
dropped criminal charges against medical interns arrested during a
four-day strike last week.
   The decision was made ``in the public interest'' and to smooth
the way for a settlement of grievances, according to a government
statement.
   Several hundred striking interns at state hospitals and clinics
stayed off the job to demand a review of salaries and working
conditions.
   More than 70 were detained by police June 14 on charges they
violated laws barring those working in essential services from going
on strike.
   The strikers spent a night in jail but were then released and
ordered to appear in court June 29 and July 19. The crimes with
which they were charged carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.
   There were no reports of deaths of patients during the strike.
   The stoppage ended after the government promised to settle
grievances in the state health service.
   Health minister Felix Muchemwa said salaries will be raised and
their compulsory attachment to state health facilities will be
reduced from five years to three years.
   Interns earn a monthly income of about $300.
   Muchemwa did not release details of the pay offer.
   Andrew Cakana, leader of the Hospital Doctors' Association, said
Wednesday his organization was reserving its comments until interns
have studied the offer.

<HEAD>Mayors Call For Higher Taxes, Criticize Recent Affirmative Action
Rulings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's mayors called for higher
federal taxes and tougher gun laws Wednesday, but their
near-unanimity on issues was shattered by a partisan leadership
battle.
   Boston's Democratic Mayor Ray Flynn, a vocal critic of the Bush
administration, was elected to a top post of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors after the group's only floor fight of their five-day meeting.
   It came at the end of a conference where partisanship flared into
the open, in contrast to recent previous gatherings where mayors did
their best to blur party distinctions.
   Flynn's contest against Republican Mayor William Althaus of York,
Pa., was unprecedented in the group's 57-year history, which usually
decides on its leadership in private.
   Flynn's election was for the unglamorous title of chairman of the
conference's advisory committee. But it is coveted because it is
third on the group's leadership ladder and means Flynn will become
conference president, and leading spokesman for the nation's mayors,
in 1991 if he remains mayor of Boston.
   The vote for Flynn was decided largely along party lines, 67-35.
But the group's incoming president, Democratic Mayor Kathryn
Whitmire of Houston, voted for the Republican. Whitmire has spoken
with optimism and conciliation toward the Bush administration. Like
Bush, she is from Texas, and she faces a tough re-election race this
year.
   Flynn said at issue in the dispute was whether mayors were
willing to be aggressive in criticizing Bush administration urban
policies.
   ``I don't think this is the time for mayors to sit back and just
go along, to say everything's all right in our cities,'' Flynn said.
``Everything is not all right in our cities. ... The Federal
government has walked away from our cities.''
   Flynn said he would decide next year whether to run for governor
of Massachusetts.
   Among the more than 50 policy statements approved by the full
conference was one calling on the administration and Congress to
raise federal taxes to reduce the deficit and to finance greater
spending on urban problems.
   The mayors approved a resolution calling for an outright ban on
possession, as well as manufacture and sale, of ``military-type''
semi-automatic assault weapons. That goes far beyond Bush's ban on
the importation of foreign-made assault weapons and would, if law,
render illegal thousands of such weapons now owned by Americans.
   The mayors' policy statements become the new policies that will
guide the conference's lobbying efforts in Congress.
   The only real policy debate came on a resolution saying the
mayors ``deplore'' recent Supreme Court decisions which they say
weaken affirmative action programs, ``making it more difficult to
ensure equal opportunities in employment for all Americans.''
   The mayors overwhelmingly voted down an effort by some Florida
mayors to soften the language of their resolution on
anti-discrimination in employment. Mayor Cecil Bradbury of Pinellas
Park, Fla., argued that whites have been victims of reverse
discrimination.
   Other resolutions called for tougher action against drugs,
poverty, homelessness and AIDS. But in an earlier committee, mayors
deleted a proposal offered by Flynn to encourage free distribution
of needles to drug adicts to reduce the spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>Court Decision Gives Media Added Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court gave the news media added
protection Wednesday, ruling that a Florida newspaper doesn't have
to pay $97,500 to a rape victim whose name it published.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, limited states' power to punish the
reporting of truthful information that is lawfully obtained. The
three dissenting justices criticized the court in a strongly worded
opinion for hampering efforts to protect the privacy of sex-crime
victims.
   Florida law makes it a crime to ``print, publish or broadcast''
the names of victims of sexual crime.
   The Florida Star, a weekly newspaper in Jacksonville, published a
rape victim's name in its Oct. 29, 1983, police report.
   The name had been obtained from a report posted, apparently by
mistake, in the press room of the Duval County Sheriff's Department.
   Most news organizations, including The Florida Star, have
policies against publication of rape victim's names. The name of the
woman, identified in court records as B.J.F., was published
inadvertently, the newpaper's lawyers said.
   Relying on the state law, the rape victim sued and won the
$97,500 award, which threatened to put the 18,000-circulation paper
out of business. Her suit also named the sheriff's department as a
defendant, but she was paid $2,500 in a pre-trial settlement.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said the award
violated free-press rights protected by the Constitution's First
Amendment.
   However, the ruling did not preclude the possibility that states
may punish those who publish the name of a sex-crime victim.
   ``We do not hold that truthful publication is automatically
constitutionally protected, or that there is no zone of privacy
within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by
the press,'' Marshall wrote.
   ``We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful
information which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully
be imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a state
interest of the highest order.''
   That interest was not present in the Florida case, Marshall said.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor and Byron R. White dissented.
   ``I would find a place to draw the line higher on the hillside: a
spot high enough to protect B.J.F.'s desire for privacy and peace of
mind in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy,'' said White,
writing for the three.
   ``There is no public interest in publishing the names, addresses
and phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime _ and no
public interest in immunizing the press from liability in the rare
cases where a state's efforts to protect a victim's privacy have
failed,'' he said.
   White noted that the woman's name was published a week after the
assault, before her assailant had been arrested.
   ``As a result, B.J.F. received harassing phone calls, required
mental health counseling, was forced to move from her home, and was
even threatened with being raped again,'' he said.
   Eric O. Simpson, publisher of The Florida Star, said he was
pleased with Wednesday's decision.
   ``We were being denied to publish the truth,'' Simpson said. ``It
constituted prior restraint.''
   Simpson said that if the award had been upheld it might have led
to laws restricting the reporting of names of victims of other types
of crimes.
   ``A person being raped is no worse than a person being killed,''
he said.
   Marshall's opinion noted past high court decisions on ``the
conflict between truthful reporting and state-protected privacy
interests.''
   The court in 1975 barred states from imposing sanctions for the
publication of truthful information _ a rape victim's name _
contained in official court records open to public inspection.
   A 1977 decision struck down a state law that barred the news
media from publishing the name or photograph of an 11-year-old boy
in connection with a juvenile court proceeding reporters had
attended.
   And in 1979, the court invalidated a state law that made it a
crime for newspapers to publish, without written approval of a
juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender
_ even if that information were obtained lawfully.
   Marshall's opinion was joined by Justices William J. Brennan,
Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice
Antonin Scalia concurred in the result.

<TEXT>
   Western nations on Wednesday condemned China's execution of three
men involved in pro-democracy unrest, and some said they may impose
punitive sanctions on Beijing.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said she was
``utterly appalled'' by the executions. ``The punishment is totally
out of proportion to the crime,'' she said.
   The men were convicted of setting fire to a train on June 6 in
Shanghai after it ran through a barricade set up by protesters,
killing six people. That protest came three days after Chinese
soldiers cleared central Beijing of pro-democracy demonstrators and
supporters.
   Eight other protesters previously had been sentenced to death in
Beijing, and up to 17 more were condemned to death Wednesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she and Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia
were discussing possible sanctions against China. She would not
elaborate.
   Britain already has canceled all ministerial visits and, like
Australia, protested the Chinese crackdown on the student-led
movement.
   President Bush said Tuesday he would try to block $1.4 billion in
development loans to China. He also canceled all high-level
contacts, including a July trip to China by Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
   Chinese students in the United States held a news conference in
Washington on Wednesday to urge the administration to step up
economic pressure on Beijing.
   ``The only language the Chinese government can listen to is
economic sanctions,'' said Ding Xueliang, 36, a sociologist and
graduate student at Harvard University.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States
deeply regretted the executions but planned no further sanctions.
``There is an important relationship which we should seek to
preserve if we possibly can,'' he said.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas denounced the executions in
a speech before the National Assembly in Paris.
   ``What is happening in China is atrocious,'' Dumas said. ``The
totalitarian machine, in all its horror, is rolling. It turns what
should be judicial decisions into veritable murders.''
   He added, ``In the name of the president, I reiterate here
France's appeal to the Chinese authorities to show clemency and
renounce executions and repression.''
   The West German government was ``deeply upset'' and renewed its
appeal for clemency for the others sentenced to death, said Hans
Klein, Chancelor Helmut Kohl's spokesman.
   He said the executions represented a ``dangerous return to the
times of human-degrading totalitarianism in the years before 1978.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was ``very
saddened'' by the executions and has appealed for clemency for
others, according to his spokeswoman, Nadia Younes.
   The Dutch government said it was seized by ``disgust.''
   ``This new sad fact can only lead to a further cooling of
relations,'' the Foreign Ministry said.
   A ministry spokesman said the executions were expected to be
discussed at next week's European Economic Community summit meeting
in Madrid, Spain.
   The Belgian government said it had learned ``with a great shock''
of the executions. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the government
deplored that China had ignored the numerous appeals for clemency.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada said: ``I think it's a
most deplorable situation ... a most regrettable turn of events.''
   The world apeared powerless to persuade China to change its
tactics in crushing the pro-democracy movement, Mulroney said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater agreed.
   ``The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of
China and it does not appear to have made much difference,'' he
said. ``History has shown that they generally are not that
responsive to outside kinds of pleas.''

<HEAD>Job Service Employees Suspended Following Discrimination Check</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten employees of a state job service
agency have been suspended for a month without pay for agreeing to
requests to provide only white male applicants for certain job
openings, officials said.
   Such actions are ``totally in violation of anything this
department is about,'' said state Jobs and Training Commissioner Joe
Samargia, whose department oversees the job service offices.
   The suspensions announced Tuesday came after an investigation by
the state Human Rights Department, which made tape-recorded phone
calls to state employment offices in April and May. In the calls,
job applicants were requested for a fictitious employer.
   ``They were told, `We don't want any females and we don't want
any minorities _ we just want white males,''' said state Human
Rights Commissioner Stephen Cooper. ``We made 12 different calls and
10 came up bad and two came up good.''
   After the findings, the state Department of Jobs and Training and
the Human Rights Department reached agreement on training and rules
to ensure that discriminatory job orders aren't accepted in the
future.
   ``We were going to file some charges, but they were willing to
work with us so we didn't need to,'' Cooper said.
   Samargia said the 10 job service interviewers were suspended last
week.
   Reconstructing one conversation, Samargia said a job service
worker told the undercover caller that the discriminatory order
could not be accepted as offered but that the order would be handled
as the caller desired.
   ``If St. Paul found out, I'd be in trouble,'' the employee said,
according to Samargia.
   An official of the Minnesota Association of Professional
Employees, a union representing nine of the suspended employees,
said it is contesting the suspensions.
   ``They were totally inappropriate,'' said union president Peter
LeWon, contending that the department provided little, if any
training for employees on how to handle such matters.
   Samargia insisted, ``We've had training on this.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov, artistic director of the
American Ballet Theatre for nine years, will step down at the end of
the 1990 season, the company's board of trustees announced Wednesday.
   The board learned Tuesday night of his decision to leave, said
Robert Pontarelli, the company's director of public relations. ``I
would say this is a surprise. It was unexpected,'' he said.
   Baryshnikov, 41, became ABT's artistic director in September
1980. He joined the company in 1974 after defecting from the Soviet
Union, where he danced with the Kirov ballet company.
   ``I will have given 10 years to the company, and it has been a
true challenge,'' he said. ``The dancers in the company are superb.
Of all the responsibilities associated with being artistic director,
I've enjoyed working with the dancers more than anything else.''
   Baryshnikov said he would ``pursue other professional options''
but did not elaborate.
   He is starring on Broadway in ``Metamorphosis,'' a play based on
Franz Kafka's story, and has appeared in such films as ``White
Nights'' and ``The Turning Point.'' He also recently launched a
perfume for women called ``Misha,'' his nickname.
   A search committee will be formed to find a successor, Pontarelli
said.
   Melville Straus, chairman of the board of the Ballet Theatre
Foundation, said in a statement: ``Misha has brought American Ballet
Theatre into a new era and has set a standard of excellence by which
the company will be measured in years to come.''

<HEAD>Energy Official Says Power Shortages are Looming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation soon may face a shortage of
electricity, a senior Energy Department official said Wednesday in
comments reflecting a Bush administration campaign to convince the
public of a need for more nuclear power plants.
   ``The demand for electricity in the United States is growing
beyond our ability to provide additional generating capacity,'' said
John C. Tuck, the undersecretary of energy.
   He noted that electricity accounts for 37 percent of total U.S.
energy use.
   Tuck said it was ``inescapable'' that many more power plants will
be needed if the economy is to continue to grow at a reasonable
rate, adding that utilities have balked at such construction because
of the high cost and lack of public support. No new nuclear plants
have been ordered in the United States since 1978.
   ``Considering all these factors, it is apparent that the nation
may have an electricity shortage on its hands in the not-too-distant
future,'' Tuck said in remarks to an industry-sponsored symposium on
nuclear reactors and U.S. energy security.
   Tuck cited the case of Long Island's Shoreham nuclear power
station, which New York state is planning to dismantle even though
it recently gained a license to operate. The Energy Department is
trying to block the move, arguing that Shoreham is needed as a
regional energy source and a national symbol of nuclear power's
future.
   Tuck said the Energy Department is eager to complete research and
development on several new types of nuclear reactors designed to be
safer and more reliable than the light-water reactors that have been
used in this country since the 1950s.
   ``We at the Energy Department believe that nuclear energy, led by
a new generation of advanced reactors, will have a role in averting
a possible electricity shortage,'' he said.
   Tuck said a greater reliance on nuclear power also would help
limit the nation's dependence on foreign oil, although this is
disputed by many private analysts. They note that while nuclear
power's only non-military role is to generate electricity, oil-fired
plant produce only about 5 percent of the nation's electricity.
About two-thirds of the oil is used in cars and other vehicles.
   Nuclear power plants generate about 20 percent of the electricity
supply.

going too fast for safety when it rammed into an iceberg and took on
water in arctic seas.
   The head of the medical team aboard a Norwegian rescue ship said
some of the Soviet crew were drunk at the time. Others involved in
the rescue contradicted him.
   Ships and helicopters took the 575 passengers, all but a dozen
West Germans, to shelter on Spitzbergen Island. They were flown
Wednesday to Dusseldorf, West Germany, cutting short their pleasure
cruise to the land of the midnight sun.
   About half the 378 Soviet crewmen stayed on board to nurse the
Maxim Gorky to harbor.
   The disabled 25,000-ton vessel was limping under its own power in
the Norwegian Sea toward Spitzbergen, about 180 miles east of the
accident, Norwegian defense officials said.
   Dr. Mads Gilbert, aboard the coast guard cutter Senja when it
broke through thick ice to rescue the people, said ``our impression
was that some of the crew were intoxicated.''
   ``We were suprised at the extent of intoxication,'' Gilbert told
state radio. He said many crew members were too drunk to help
operate pumps 12 hours after the accident.
   Rescued passengers, some of whom spent seven hours in lifeboats
at near-freezing temperatures, said they had been offered whiskey
and vodka during the ordeal to ward off the cold.
   ``The German passengers had nothing but praise for the Soviet
crew and said nothing about drunken crewmen,'' said Spitzbergen Gov.
Leif Eldring, who met arriving passengers early Wednesday.
   ``If the crew had been drunk, the Maxim Gorky would have sunk,''
said a Soviet Embassy official in Oslo, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Maritime experts said the ship was moving at 21 mph when it
struck the ice, much faster than it should have sailed in
treacherous waters.
   ``I would hardly have sailed faster than two to three knots in
such ice-clogged water,'' said Sigurd Kleiven, captain of the Senja.
   Guttorm Jacobsen, a skipper who has sailed the arctic for 40
years, told the Verdens Gang newspaper agreed, saying: ``The Maxim
Gorky must have been too eager to keep its schedule.''
   The collision tore a gash 20 feet long and four to six inches
wide in the bow. The ship took on 18,000 tons of water and was
listing badly when the passengers scrambled into lifeboats.
   For West German passenger Giesela Rillinger, ``It was six hours
of nothing but ice floes and the sky. If a storm had come up it
would have been all over for us. Six hours of facing death.''
   Passenger Maria Sontheimer, 71, also interviewed in Dusseldorf,
said most people were seasick and ``the waves bounced us against
each other.''
   Some left the rafts and climbed onto ice floes for fear of being
crushed between drifting blocks of ice.
   ``We stood on the ice and all around us, it cracked and crashed
together. One had that feeling that if you turned around those
standing behind you would disappear,'' said Lutheran minister Horst
Drosihn.
   The NRK report said a lifeboat with 50 elderly passengers got
stuck as it was being lowered into the water and dangled for four
hours halfway down Maxim Gorky's side.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said sailors plugged the holes in the
bow. It would receive emergency repairs on Spitzbergen, Tass said.

<HEAD>AMA Endorses Federal Mandated, Employer-Provided Health Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association, for the first
time in its history, endorsed Wednesday the concept of federally
mandated, employer-provided health insurance.
   Under a proposal passed by delegates at the AMA's annual
policymaking convention, the nation's largest organization of
doctors agreed to press for legislation calling for ``a phased-in
requirement that employers (limited initially to larger employers)
provide health-insurance coverage within the private sector for all
full-time employees, with coverage expanding over several years.''
   In addition, the delegates recommended ``a program of diminishing
tax credits or other incentives to avoid adverse effects on
employers.''
   The policy adopted by the 433 members of the House of Delegates
calls for the AMA to work with business groups to develop the
approaches that are best suited to the needs of small employers.
   Such legislation would help the nation's 37 million uninsured and
also would allow doctors to recover fees lost under the Medicaid
program, an AMA spokesman said.
   Small businesses have lobbied heavily against proposals calling
for any type of federally mandated employer-provided insurance, and
an industry spokeswoman said they would do the same with measures
like that endorsed by the AMA.
   Marcia Bradford, spokeswoman for National Small Business United,
a Washington, D.C. lobbying organization representing about 50,000
small businesses, said that while the AMA's desire to include small
businesses in developing national legislation is a step in the right
direction, ``there's still a fundamental question of government
mandates that we're opposed to.''
   The AMA's action is part of the organization's effort to combat
moves to nationalize the U.S. health care system. A group of
physicians started such an effort this year, seeking adoption of a
system similar to Canada's in which individuals and employers are
taxed to pay for health coverage for all.
   The AMA's Board of Trustees strongly opposes the Canadian system,
in which ``all responsibility for health care payment is placed on
the government.''
   The AMA also opposes a move led by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
to force employers to provide a specific package of health-insurance
benefits for employees, said Dr. Wayne Bradley, the AMA's assistant
executive vice president.
   That plan, with no gradual phase-in, ``might cause an employer
not to hire an extra person, or it might cause a business to go
broke,'' Bradley said.
   The AMA favors less drastic reforms and advocates ``the principle
that employees be covered by health insurance in the workplace,'' he
said. ``It's a major national problem.''
   Bradley said it was the first time the AMA had endorsed the
concept of federally mandated, employer-provided health insurance.
   In other action Wednesday, the delegates elected the first female
phsyician to the AMA's Board of Trustees, its governing body.
   Nancy Dickey of Richmond, Texas, thanked the delegates for the
``history you have just made.'' Women have been appointed in the
past by other board members to student and resident trustee
positions, but Dickey is the first to be elected a regular trustee
by the full delegation.
   Dr. Alan Nelson, a Salt Lake City internist and president-elect
for the past year, was named president of the AMA. Nelson takes over
the one-year post from Dr. James Davis, a Durham, N.C., surgeon. Dr.
C. John Tupper, an internist from Davis, Calif., was elected
president-elect.
   Dr. Mary Ann Contogiannis, a resident physician from
Winston-Salem, N.C., was elected to the resident position on the
Board of Trustees.
   Dr. William E. Jacott, a family physician from Minneapolis, was
elected to the Board of Trustees. Re-elected to the board were Dr.
Frank B. Walker, a pathologist from Detroit, and Dr. John Ring, a
family physician from Mundelein.

   Israeli politicians said in a stormy parliament
debate Wednesday that vigilante action by Jewish settlers could push
the country to the brink of civil war.
   Legislators were divided about how to curb government-armed
Jewish settlers living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arab assailants in the West Bank town of Nablus shot and killed
47-year-old taxi driver Hassan Sharoub on Wednesday. He was
suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities, Israeli radio
reports and Arab journalists said. The army said it was
investigating.
   In the Gaza Strip, 12 Palestinians were wounded in confrontations
with Israeli troops Wednesday, Arab reports said. The army confirmed
one of the wounded in Gaza and said three other Palestinians were
wounded in clashes in the West Bank.
   Sharoub's death brings to 527 the toll of Palestinians killed in
their 18-month rebellion against Israeli occupation. Among the dead
are 64 suspected collaborators. Twenty-three Israelis also have died.
   Israeli leaders raised the specter of civil warfare after Jewish
settlers, angered at the weekend killing of a U.S.-born settler,
went on rampages after his funeral Tuesday.
   Three Palestinian shepherds have been detained for the killing of
Frederick Steven Rosenfeld, 48, who was stabbed Saturday as he hiked
around Arab villages near his West Bank settlement of Ariel.
   Settlers at Rosenfeld's funeral shouted down Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, calling him a traitor and accusing him of failing to
protect Jews living in the territories.
   After the funeral, one settler pumped submachine gunfire at Arabs
waiting for rides near Tel Aviv, wounding two. At least four other
Palestinians were injured when their cars were hit by stones thrown
by Jewish protesters.
   Earlier, fistfights erupted at the burial service when settlers
attacked a left-wing activist and then struck soldiers who rescued
the man.
   Israeli officials say they fear the settlers increasingly could
direct their violence at Israeli soldiers or Jewish political rivals.
   Shamir on Wednesday urged Israelis not to battle among themselves.
   ``We must do everything to make sure such a war never happens,''
Shamir said on Israel radio. ``This is the most dangerous thing.''
   ``I would suggest to everyone to lower the profile of our
internal debates,'' he said.
   The debate in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, left legislators
divided over whether the army should take harsher action to crush
the Palestinian revolt or to restrict settlers.
   Yossi Sarid of the left-leaning Citizens Rights Movement said if
only a small number of settlers are violent, as the government
suggests, they should be jailed.
   But Rafael Eitan, a former army chief of staff from the
right-wing Tsomet Party, said it was the government's failure to
curb Arab violence that prompted settlers' actions.
   ``In a situation where the government is not capable of
maintaining the security of its citizens, hotheads are always liable
to stand up and take the law into their own hands,'' he said.
   Legislators joined in condemning the violence.
   Eitan said the incidents ``must shock us all into seeing what can
happen in the future.''
   Sarid said: ``All is ready for a civil war. There are enough
weapons to prove people are ready to kill innocent civilians.''

<HEAD>Black Priest to Start Own African-American Catholic Congregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA WOMACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black priest who plans to start a separate
African-American Catholic congregation said Wednesday he is not
defying Roman Catholic tenets, despite warnings from church leaders.
   ``While the establishment of this congregation does not enjoy the
endorsement or authority of His Eminence, James Cardinal Hickey, we
see ourselves as being obedient to the law of God and following the
dictates of our consciences,'' said the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr.
   Stallings, 41, said he plans to create the Imani Temple
African-American Catholic Congregation in Washington because the
Roman Catholic Church has failed to meet the spiritual and cultural
demands of its black parishioners.
   However, the priest said his move is not intended to be a
departure from Catholicism.
   He said his church would adopt a Zairian liturgy and would
combine readings from the works of noted black writers and
philosophers, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, with
traditional Scripture passages.
   Imani means ``faith'' in Swahili.
   Cardinal Hickey of Washington and a prominent black church leader
both condemned Stallings' actions.
   ``In spite of his claims to the contrary, Father Stallings'
action is a serious step towards separating himself from the Roman
Catholic Church,'' Hickey said in a statement. ``This situation has
more to do with the needs and expectations of Father Stallings than
with broader questions about the adequacy of Catholic ministry
within the black community.''
   Bishop John Ricard, chairman of the Committee for Black Catholics
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, also expressed
criticism, in a statement issued by Hickey's office.
   ``Although I acknowledge that we as African-American Catholics
still find it necessary to struggle for full inclusion in the
Catholic Church, the founding of the Imani Temple is a regressive
step,'' Ricard said.
   Hickey also said that Stallings' former Catholic parishioners
should not support his efforts and that doing so would leave them in
an ``ambiguous position'' with the Roman Catholic Church.
   Stallings said of his own situation, ``I cannot be excommunicated
from my faith. ... When I lay down I have to answer not to an
institution but to the man that woke me up.''
   Of the nation's 300 bishops, 13 are black. While there are about
1,100 predominantly black parishes nationwide, there are just 200
black priests.
   Hickey noted that Stallings made his announcement even though the
bishops, in their national conference, committed themselves only
last Sunday to stronger efforts to support the black Catholic
community.
   But Stallings said those efforts fall short of black
parishioners' needs.

   China's execution of three people Wednesday for
burning a train during a pro-democracy protest flouted worldwide
calls for mercy in the government's crackdown on political dissent.
   The death sentences, announced on radio and television, were
carried out in Shanghai, where the arson incident occurred June 6.
   The executions came a day after President Bush appealed for
clemency, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged
that China had turned its back on the pleas.
   ``The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of
China and it does not appear to have made much difference,'' he
said. ``History has shown that they generally are not that
responsive to outside kinds of pleas.''
   So far, 28 people have been condemned to death: the three who
were executed, the 17 who were sentenced on Wednesday after a public
trial in Shandong province, and eight others in Beijing who were
previously sentenced to death.
   Their crimes ranged from ``rumor-mongering'' to beating soldiers
and burning vehicles.
   The three executed were convicted of setting fire to a train
after it smashed through a barricade set up by demonstrators,
killing six people. The three then beat firefighters who tried to
douse the blaze, according to the Shanghai People's Intermediate
Court.
   Bush on Tuesday suspended high-level U.S.-Chinese contacts and
moved to block $1.4 billion in development loans to protest the
crackdown. France and the Netherlands already had frozen relations
and Japan has suspended new development loans.
   The government depends heavily on foreign investment for capital
and technology, and has stressed during the past two weeks that
things are back to normal in China.
   China did not immediately respond to the U.S. moves, but the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday the United States was
interfering in China's affairs and that there would be no mercy.
   ``The 11 thugs have been sentenced to death according to China's
criminal law, because they committed heinous crimes of beating,
smashing, looting and burning,'' Xinhua before the additional
sentences were announced.
   Other nations had joined the United States in urging clemency,
and some denounced China following the executions.
   ``What is happening in China is atrocious,'' Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas of France told the National Assembly in Paris. ``The
totalitarian machine, in all its horror, is rolling.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said in London that
she and Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia were discussing steps
against the Chinese government. ``The punishment is totally out of
proportion to the crime,'' she said.
   In the Hague, the Dutch government said it was seized by
``disgust.'' ``This new sad fact can only lead to a further cooling
of relations,'' said a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.
   China began its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement on June 3
and has said the matter is a domestic affair.
   Premier Li Peng said Monday the government would spare no effort
in tracking down protest organizers.
   The approach is not new. In a 1987 speech, senior leader Deng
Xiaoping said that after widespread arrests of pro-democracy
protesters 10 years ago, China suffered ``no discredit,'' and that
``on the contrary, the prestige of the country is steadily growing.''
   Fitzwater said the United States could not afford to turn its
back on China even though it deplored the crackdown.
   ``Everyone has to recognize, first of all, that this is a country
of a billion people ... a sizeable portion of the world's population
that cannot be closeted off and ignored,'' he said.
   China imposes the death penalty for certain violent and economic
crimes but also for some political offenses, and often for crimes
involving foreigners.
   In April a court in Shanghai sentenced a man to death after he
was convicted of robbing the U.S. Consulate in that city over a
period of 14 months of about $8,900.
   The human rights group Amnesty International said in 1985 that
10,000 people had been executed in China since a nationwide
crackdown on crime two years earlier. Chinese officials do not
release figures on executions.

   A 16-year-old Oklahoma girl gave birth
Wednesday in the bathroom of a Senate office building while the
group she was with toured the Capitol.
   ``Last I heard she was doing fine,'' said Capitol Police
spokesman Dan Nichols. ``She walked out of the bathroom carrying the
baby.''
   Nichols said the Blanchard, Okla., girl, whose name was not
released because she is a minor, went into a bathroom on the ground
floor of the Senate Dirksen office building about 8 a.m. EDT and
gave birth.
   The group's chaperon, Don Grabbe, helped deliver the boy, Nichols
said.
   ``When I got there it was the mother and two of the people on the
tour trying to get the baby to breathe,'' said Debora Brooke, a
Capitol Police sergeant who said she rushed from another building to
help.
   ``He was kind of red,'' she said. ``I was able to put my finger
down the little boy's throat and he coughed up some of the mucus and
starting breathing on his own.''
   The girl and infant were taken to the Washington Hospital Center
where officials said the mother was in fair condition.
   The 4-pound-5{-ounce baby, who officials believe was born
prematurely, was listed in critical condition, said hospital
spokesman Alexander Sinclair.
   No other details were immediately available.

   The nation's No. 2 politician is hoping his
favorite comic book superhero sidekick will make a comeback.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, joining the hordes of Americans
getting in on the summer ``Batman'' hype, planned to take his wife,
Marilyn, and their three children to Thursday's Washington premiere
of the newest adventure of Gotham City's Caped Crusader.
   Afterward, the family was going to the National Zoo for a
reception at the zoo's new bat cave exhibit, said Quayle press
secretary David Beckwith.
   Beckwith said he asked his boss if he was a Batman fan and Quayle
replied: ``Actually I'm a Robin fan. I'm going to see if Robin makes
a comeback.''
   Robin, Batman's youthful, exclamatory partner, was killed off
last year after the strip's publisher conducted a poll of readers as
to what should be his fate.
   Beckwith said Quayle agreed to go to the movie at the urging of
his children, Tucker, 14, Corrine, 10, and Benjamin, 12.
   ``Batman,'' starring Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader, opens
Friday at theaters around the country.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Invites Gorbachev to Iran, Agrees on Economic Cooperation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and the Soviet Union ended nearly a decade of
icy relations Wednesday when Iran's Parliament speaker invited
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to visit Iran and the two leaders agreed on
wide economic cooperation.
   Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani told the Soviet president that
Iranians hold him in high esteem and look forward to meeting him,
the official Tass news agency reported.
   It said Gorbachev thanked Rafsanjani for the invitation and said
frequent high-level contacts are appropraite as relations warm. No
date was set.
   Only a handful of Third World leaders have visited Tehran since
the 1979 Islamic Revolution transformed the Iranian capital into a
city known for mobs of religious fanatics shouting, ``Death to
America! Death to Russia!''
   Rafsanjani and Gorbachev have been meeting in the Kremlin over
two days with a number of their colleagues. Tass said they will sign
several agreements before Rafsanjani leaves Moscow.
   Among them are a promise to be good neighbors on their 1,550-mile
border and an agreement on joint projects in 15 areas of the
economy, including nuclear energy, gas processing, and space.
   The level of relations, which may extend to putting an Iranian on
board a Soviet spaceship, marks a dramatic turnaround. Earlier this
decade, the Soviet Union was supplying weapons for Iraq to fight
Iran, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fundamentalist regime was
banning Iran's Communist Party.
   In contrast, Tass quoted Rafsanjani as saying Wednesday, ``I have
been in Moscow less than 24 hours, yet already I feel almost at
home.''
   Tehran television said Rafsanjani is extending his visit beyond
the planned Thursday departure.
   It was Rafsanjani who suggested a joint Soviet-Iranian space
voyage, and Gorbachev ordered his deputies to begin planning details.
   Rafsanjani emphasized that it was Khomeini himself who in
February, several months before his death on June 3, called for
better relations with the Soviet Union. Tass noted that Gorbachev
and Khomeini exchanged messages in February, and since then their
foreign ministers have met four times.
   ``We should admit that in the past we had periods where our
border turned into a blank wall,'' Gorbachev said at a Kremlin
banquet for Rafsanjani. ``It is good that those times apparently
have passed.''
   Moscow had hoped the revolution that ousted the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, a longtime U.S. ally, would give it a toehold
in the nation on its southern border. Instead, Iranian
fundamentalists chose an independent path and held Moscow in disdain.
   Now, Tass said, rail links will be restored and another rail line
constructed.
   With ties to the West strained, Tehran is looking to the Soviet
bloc for help in rebuilding Iran after its eight-year war with Iraq,
which halted with a cease-fire in August.
   Iranian officials said last month they hoped to sign an arms deal
with Moscow, but Tass said nothing on the subject.

<HEAD>Government Allows Boeing 737-400 Jets To Fly With Power Curb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Civil Aviation Authority Wednesday lifted its
grounding order on 12 Boeing 737-400 planes operated by British
airlines provided modifications are made to the engines.
   The planes were grounded nine days ago after two incidents in
which 737-400s were forced to make emergency landings because fan
blades broke in their CFM 56-3C engines.
   The engines are manufactured by CFM International, a joint
venture between SNECMA of France and General Electric of the United
States.
   Britain's aviation authority imposed power cuts of 1,500 pounds
of thrust on the CFM 56-3C engines, effectively converting them to a
previous generation of that make.
   The planes will be allowed a maximum thrust of 22,000 pounds, the
same as the previous CFM 56-3B, which had 6 million hours of
reliable service.
   Airlines were also ordered to replace the engines' fan blades and
discs. Regular visual inspections of fan blades and the front face
of the engine discs will also be required, a spokesman for the
British authority said.
   Airlines were already making the modifications and some 737-400s
might be back in operation on Thursday, he said.
   Demonstrations Wednesday by the engine manufacturer showed that
fan fatigue occurred near the peak in the engine's thrust, the
spokesman said.
   ``It has now been found that running it at that higher speed,
particularly at the rate of climb, has induced something that will
need further investigation,'' he said.
   The grounding order was made after fan blades broke on a DanAir
plane at Gatwick Airport on June 9 and on a British Midland Airways
aircraft at Heathrow Airport on June 11.
   Fan blade problems were also thought to have contributed to the
engine failure that led to the January crash of a British Midland
737-400 near East Midlands Airport in Leicestershire, killing 47.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Adminstration rejected the British
authority's grounding request and cleared 737-400s to fly with the
lower engine thrust and new blades and discs.
   In addition to British Midland and DanAir, 737-400s are operated
by Novair, Air Europe and Air UK-Leisure.

   A Soviet man who apparently stowed away in the
undercarriage of a Japanese jet was found crushed to death Wednesday
when the plane arrived from Moscow, police and airline officials
said.
   All Nippon Airways said the dead man is believed to be a
21-year-old Russian who had been trying to emigrate.
   The airline's Boeing 747 left Tokyo on Monday and had been in
Moscow nearly two days before it flew to England on a trial run for
its new Tokyo to London service beginning next month. It carried no
passengers.
   Airline spokesman Shinobu Hasegawa said a British Airways
engineer found the body inside the wheel well in the right hand main
undercarriage after the plane landed at London's Gatwick Airport.
   ``We are fairly sure he was attempting to defect because his
paperwork was not in order. The police, ourselves and the airport
are in touch with the Russian Embassy,'' Hasegawa said.
   Sussex police said they believe the man was crushed when the
undercarriage was raised after take off.
   ``There are no suspicious circumstances, and from documentation
found in the bay it would appear that the body is that of a Russian
national,'' a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   A coroner is negotiating with the Soviet Embassy to establish the
man's identity, the spokesman said.

   A judge temporarily restored driving
privileges Wednesday to a married teen-ager whose license was
suspended under a law aimed at curbing a high rate of school
dropouts.
   Kanawha County Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib Jr. set aside Michael
Mean's license suspension for 30 days to allow attorneys to file
briefs in the case.
   Means, 17, of Charleston, who dropped out of the ninth grade last
year, appealed a Department of Motor Vehicles decision to suspend
his license under a first-of-its-kind law aimed at reducing the
state's dropout rate, now about 17 percent.
   Under education reform law passed by the Legislature last summer,
students under 18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days of school
or have 15 unexcused absences must give up their driving privileges.
   Means' attorney, Christopher Butch, argued that the law was in
conflict with another state law permitting students to drop out of
school at age 16. The law, he said, was condemning Means and his
family to poverty because he was unable to earn the money he needed
to support his family without a driver's license.
   ``The law is not only draconian, it's unreasonable in this
case,'' Butch told the court Wednesday.
   Means' 16-year-old wife, Tonya, who is expecting a child in
August, said the state was preventing her husband from caring for
her and their unborn child. Her license also was suspended because
she is a dropout.
   ``We have the same responsibilities as anyone over 18,'' she
said. ``He has a house to pay for and has to earn money to care for
me and the baby.''
   Means said despite the judge's decision, he still felt the state
was trying to force him to return to school.
   ``I think they're trying to pressure me, to force me to enroll in
a (high school equivalency) program. I don't like being forced to do
anything,'' he said.
   Zakaib said Means could retain his driving privileges permanently
if he enrolls in an equivalency course and makes satisfactory
progress.
   Deputy Attorney General Bruce Wilson, who represents the
Department of Motor Vehicles, said he was satisfied with the
progress of the case.
   ``I was just worried that this would drag on through the courts
until he turned 18,'' Wilson said. `` I think this allows for a
quick resolution.''
   Butch left the court room immediately after the judge stayed the
suspension and was unavailable for comment.
   Wilson argued that revoking the decision to suspend Mean's
license would send the wrong message to teen-agers in similar
situations.
   ``It will encourage those people who want to avoid their
responsibility to the state and to themselves,'' Wilson said.
   He argued that statistics show dropouts are less likely to be
able to obtain jobs paying above the minimum wage.
   ``Maybe an education, some training, would help these people
break this cycle, a cycle of poverty and lowered ambitions.''
   Therese Wilson, director of the Office of Support Services for
the state Department of Education, testified that after the law went
into effect, 1,800 dropouts returned to school in the fall and 50
percent were still attending school in March.
   The state's recent dropout rate of around 17 percent is
equivalent to 5,000 students, Wilson said. The state expected to
reduce the rate this year by 1,000 students as a direct result of
the new law, she said.
   Several states, including Wisconsin and Texas where Gov. Bill
Clements signed a dropout bill into law Friday, have passed similar
legislation and others are considering such laws.

   The United States does not plan further
sanctions to punish China for executing three people and hopes to
preserve relations with Beijing ``if we possibly can,'' Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said Wednesday.
   Baker said at the White House ``we deeply regret'' the
executions, which were carried out in Shanghai over pleas for
clemency by the United States and other Western nations.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said, ``We're very disappointed with
the government of China.'' He repeated U.S. calls for restraint.
   One day after adopting new sanctions and asking China to spare
the lives of demonstrators sentenced to death, the United States
muted its reaction to the executions. State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said there was no plan to register a protest or to
call in a Chinese diplomat.
   President Bush brushed aside reporters' questions about the
matter.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said sanctions and pleas
for leniency have not swayed Chinese leaders.
   ``It's hard to suggest that there has been very much impact''
Fitzwater said.
   ``The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of
China and it does not appear to have made much difference.'' He said
``history has shown that they generally are not that responsive to
outside kinds of pleas.''
   Fitzwater joined Baker in emphasizing that the United States must
continue to do business with China despite international outrage
over the country's bloody crackdown and suppression of pro-democracy
forces.
   ``This is a country of a billion people and is a sizable portion
of the world population that cannot be closeted off and ignored,''
Fitzwater said.
   On Capitol Hill, however, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said that in view of the executions and other ``barbaric''
acts, ``the president must and should consider taking further steps,
particularly with respect to trade.''
   ``There are times when what American stands for and believes in
is more important than an economic benefit to be derived from a
trade relationship,'' Mitchell said.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
foreign operations subcommittee, said he told Chinese Ambassador Han
Xu that economic sanctions are certain to be imposed if executions
continue.
   ``Much that has been built up in the last 10 years could be
destroyed,'' Leahy said.
   He said Han replied that actions by his government are ``internal
matters'' and that he hoped the administration ``would be careful in
not taking steps that would sever a relationship carefully nurtured
over a decade.''
   After prodding from Congress, the White House announced Tuesday
it was ending all high-level official contacts with Beijing and
attempting to postpone new loans from international banks, a step
that could affect at least $1.4 billion for Beijing.
   The World Bank, chief source of aid to Third World countries,
said it already had suspended new loans to China, as of June 8, just
days after Chinese troops killed hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of
demonstrators in Beijing.
   Shanghai authorities executed three men who were convicted of
setting fire to a train after it crashed through a barricade erected
by pro-democracy demonstrators and killed six people.
   Baker said, ``The United States is not contemplating any
additional action at this time'' against Beijing.
   ``There is an important relationship here which we should seek to
preserve if we possibly can,'' Baker said. ``That is a consideration
that must be taken on board.''
   Baker commented to reporters outside the White House as he
escorted visiting West German Foreign Minister Hans
Dietrich-Genscher to a luncheon.
   Genscher had been asked his reaction during a picture-taking
session with Bush and began to reply that ``we are condemning the
brutal. ...'' His comment was cut off by a White House aide who
shouted an order for the photo session to end.
   Later, Genscher told a news conference that he and Bush
``discussed with great concern the developments in the People's
Republic of China. I said that we condemn the brutality that is
expressed in the death sentences and their execution.''
   Fitzwater, discussing the U.S. approach to China's crackdown,
said, ``It's important that we have some perspective in viewing the
overall, long-term relationship with China and that we believe we
have tried to strike the right balance.
   ``We feel we're walking a line there in a sense but we think
there's been no question about how the U.S. feels,'' he said. ``No
one around the world can have any doubt about the U.S. outrage at
this entire process.''

   Congressional leaders Wednesday urged President
Bush to consider curbing trade with China in an effort to end the
executions of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``The president must and should consider taking further steps,
particularly with respect to trade,'' Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, told the Senate, calling the executions
``barbaric'' acts.
   ``I say that in full awareness that we benefit from trade with
China,'' Mitchell said. ``But there are times when what America
stands for and believes in is more important than an economic
benefit to be derived from a trade relationship.''
   Three men were executed in Shanghai on Wednesday and as many as
17 other people have been sentenced to death for their roles in the
student-led protests earlier this month.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Sentate Appropriations
foreign operations subcommittee, said he told Chinese Ambassador Han
Xu in an hour-long conversation Wednesday that economic sanctions
were certain if repression and executions continue.
   ``Much that has been built up in the last 10 years could be
destroyed,'' Leahy said. ``If the repression and executions continue
much longer, the break will be irreparable.''
   Han, Leahy said, replied with ``the official line,'' stating that
actions taken by his government are ``internal matters.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, introduced legislation to
make it easier for Chinese students and scholars in the United
States to apply for asylum.
   He said the purpose of the legislation was to provide a safe
haven for students who fear persecution if they return and to signal
the Chinese government ``that its repressive campaign will mean the
loss of thousands of its best and brightest students.''
   Cohen said his bill would go beyond the step taken by President
Bush of authorizing a special immigration status permitting Chinese
students to remain through June 5, 1990.
   An alternative bill was introduced by Sens. Herb Kohl, D-Wis.,
and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., to permit Chinese students to renew
their visas and apply for permanent residence in the United States.
   There are more than 40,000 Chinese students attending American
colleges and universities.

   A few major cable television operators are now
the ``godfathers'' of the industry, exacting tribute from start-up
companies and withholding programming from rural viewers, a Senate
panel was told Wednesday.
   An increasingly prosperous cable industry has raised prices and
stiff-armed microwave and home satellite dish companies that need
programming, while growing into a ``cable Cosa Nostra'' that can do
as it pleases without fear of regulation or competition, Sen. Albert
Gore, D-Tenn., said.
   Since 1986, when a 1984 law deregulating cable was fully in
place, only about six new cable program networks have been
successful, and they all are at least partially owned by major cable
system operators, Gore said at a Senate communications subcommittee
hearing on ownership of the cable TV industry.
   In the wake of deregulation, ``We have witnessed an extraordinary
concentration of control and integration by cable operators and
program services, manifesting itself in blatantly anticompetitive
behavior towards those who would compete with existing cable
operators for the right to distribute services,'' Gore said.
   ``In the case of satellite dish owners, for example, program
services have consistently refused to deal with distributors unless
they are cable operators, shutting out almost all competition for a
market that, ironically, cable itself has largely refused to
serve,'' added Gore, who has introduced legislation that would
re-regulate cable, allow telephone companies to compete in cable and
require cable operators to provide access for all program services
and delivery technologies.
   Wednesday's was the second in a series of three hearings on media
ownership that have featured a virtual who's who of television
industry executives.
   The hearings were spurred by increasing complaints to Congress of
price hikes and poor service and of ``quick-buck'' buying and
selling of cable systems. The ``horizontal concentration'' of a few
companies has turned cable into a major TV force that enters more
than half the nation's living rooms.
   At least a dozen bills are pending in Congress to re-regulate
cable prices, try to induce competition or to slow the shift of TV
sports to pay television.
   James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, testified that there was ``great sensitivity'' in his
industry to complaints but that cable has changed television for the
better as it loosened the stranglehold of ABC, CBS and NBC and
offered far more and better programming.
   Cable industry investment in new programming _ so-called vertical
integration _ has spurred the cable boom and has not impeded the
development of competing technologies or program services, Mooney
said.
   But Preston Padden, president of the Association of Independent
Television Stations, said that when NBC launched its new Consumer
News and Business Channel earlier this year, NBC reportedly paid the
nation's largest cable system operator, Tele-Communications Inc.,
``an estimated $20 million to buy or lease Tempo Television _ a
cable service whose apparent assets would appear to have been
negligible.''
   ``That transaction has all the appearances of the payment of
tribute for access through TCI's concentrated monopoly subscriber
base,'' Padden said.
   Gore called it a ``shakedown'' by a ``godfather''-like ``cable
Cosa Nostra'' in which any new programming source first must get
approval from a half-dozen major cable operators before it can even
think of proceeding.
   Gore, subcommittee Chairman Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and
Sens. Larry Pressler, R.-S.D., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont., expressed
concern that their largely rural constituencies were being
shortchanged by the cable industry's apparent reluctance to sell
programs to microwave cable and home satellite dish users.

   A Senate panel has asked a judge to grant a
lawyer immunity to compel him to testify in the impeachment trial of
federal judge Alcee Hastings.
   U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer has scheduled a Monday
hearing on the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee request for an
order granting immunity for William Borders.
   Borders was convicted in 1982 of accepting a bribe in exchange
for agreeing to try to influence Hastings.
   Hastings, of Miami, was acquitted in 1983 of charges that he
conspired with Borders to solicit a $150,000 payoff from two
defendants in exchange for a reduction in their sentences.
   Borders was sentenced to five years in prison.
   The House voted 17 articles of impeachment against Hastings in
August, including allegations that he lied at his trial six years
ago.

<HEAD>Locally Heavy Rain Persists Across The East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain triggered floods that forced several hundred people
from their homes in Pennsylvania on Wednesday as showers and
thunderstorms fell over much of the eastern third of the nation.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from the central Gulf
Coast to the Tennessee Valley, eastern sections of the Ohio Valley,
the lower Great Lakes and the mid- and south Atlantic Coast.
   Rainfall during the 24 hours up to 8 a.m. EDT included 5.76
inches at Wadley, Ala.; 5.50 inches at St. Marys, Pa.; 2.53 inches
at Clermont, Pa.; 2.34 inches at Wilcox, Pa.; and 2.18 inches at
Murphy, N.C.
   Flood or flash flood watches were posted in sections of Alabama,
Georgia, Tennessee, the Carolinas, Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York.
   The rain swelled creeks in Pennsylvania's western and central
mountains and threatened serious flooding downstream on the
Allegheny and Ohio rivers.
   In Ridgway, Pa., a town of about 5,600 in Elk County, about 200
people were evacuated Tuesday and Wednesday before the Clarion River
crested at about 6 feet over flood stage, according to county
Emergency Management Coordinator Ed Zettle.
   In Jefferson County, Pa., about 300 people were evacuated at
Brockway and nearby Snyder, and about 15 families sought higher
ground at Reynoldsville. State police said flooding and mud slides
closed several roads in the area.
   Two bridges were washed out along Cross Creek in Brooke County in
West Virginia's northern panhandle, the weather service said.
   In the morning, thunderstorms poured heavy rain across parts of
Alabama, North Carolina and Michigan. More than an inch and a half
of rain fell in two hours in Henderson, N.C., up to an inch and a
half in three hours in Lincoln and Abel, Ala., and inch and third in
two hours in Plymouth, Mich.
   Strong afternoon thunderstorms over southeastern Alabama blew
down trees and power lines at Clio and dropped hail as big as dimes
near Ozark.
   Huntsville, Ala., has already received 11.65 inches of rain this
month; the former record for the whole month of June was 7.30 inches
in 1976. This is in sharp contrast to last year, when Huntsville had
its driest June on record with only 0.17 inch of rain.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms also fell on the northern
Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley, with scattered showers over
southern New England.
   High wind gusts were common behind a cold front over the northern
and west-central plains, with gusts near 60 mph reported at
Cheyenne, Wyo., and Pierre, S.D., and near 50 mph at Goodland, Kan.,
and Fort Collins, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Casper, Wyo., to 104 at Thermal and Palm Springs, Calif.,
and Phoenix. Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 21 degrees
at South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
upper Ohio Valley to the mid-Atlantic Coast; scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the southern Atlantic Coast to the Tennessee
Valley and the central Gulf Coast, from the upper Great Lakes to the
upper and middle Mississippi Valley and the southern half of the
Plains, and over the lower Great Lakes, eastern sections of the
lower Ohio Valley and the Rockies; and widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms over the northern half of the Plains.
   Highs in the 60s and lower 70s were predicted in the northern and
central Rockies; above 90 degrees from Florida to parts of the
middle and lower Mississippi Valley and much of Texas; above 100
degrees over inland central and southern California, the desert
Southwest and parts of southwestern Texas; and in the 70s and 80s in
much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Chemical Removed from Hazard List</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Wednesday declared that sodium sulfate, which accounts for about
half of the hazardous chemical releases by industry nationwide,
isn't a toxic substance at all.
   Sodium sulfate is a widely used agent and byproduct in a variety
of processes including the production of paper, glass and detergents.
   The chemical industry had petitioned the EPA to reclassify sodium
sulfate arguing that there is no evidence the chemical poses a
significant health threat.
   The action by the EPA had been expected. The agency staff had
earlier recommended that sodium sulfate be reclassified as being
nontoxic ``due to an apparent absence of significant toxicity
concerns'' about the chemical.
   Robert J. Israel, EPA petitions coordinator, said the
reclassification was taken after the agency concluded that sodium
sulfate ``did not meet the health and environmental toxicity
criteria'' required by the law.
   The chemical is widely used in industry and accounted for nearly
54 percent of all the toxic chemicals releases into the air, water
and soil during 1987, according to an EPA report eaerlier this week
on releases by industry of 328 toxic chemicals.
   The agency said that more than 12 billion pounds of sodium
sulfate were releases by industrial plants, most of it into surface
water, during 1987.
   The absence of sodium sulfate from the EPA toxic chemical list
will result in significant changes in the national profile on toxic
releases, agency officials said.
   For example, the largest volume of sodium sulfate releases
occurred in California, including 5.3 billion pounds from one plant,
causing that state to lead every other state in toxic industrial
chemical releases for 1987. Without sodium sulfate, California would
have ranked ninth, the EPA said.
   Overall, 22.5 billion pounds of toxic releases were reported for
1987, according to the EPA report. But that volume is more than cut
in half without sodium sulfate.
   Water discharges were the most common form of toxic chemical
releases in 1987 largedly because three-fourths of all relases of
sodium sulfate were into surface water. Without sodium sulfate,
water releases would have ranked last.

<HEAD>Physician's Wife Says Hurt Referred to Jennings As His Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Hurt referred to his lover as his wife
when she was pregnant with their child, according to a doctor's wife
who testified Wednesday that she recognized the actor's voice from
the movie ``Body Heat.''
   Shirley Credle of Beaufort, S.C., wife of Dr. Bernard Credle, an
obstetrician, said Hurt called their house sometime after he arrived
in the state in late October 1982 to film ``The Big Chill.''
   Hurt was referring to dancer Sandra Jennings, 32, who was then
about eight months pregnant with Hurt's son, Alexander Devon Hurt,
now 6.
   Jennings claims a common-law marriage exists between her and Hurt
under South Carolina statutes. She says she now wants a ``divorce''
and up to half of everything he has earned in the past 6{ years.
   Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, estimates Hurt's worth at $10
million.
   Mrs. Credle said she did not recognize Hurt's voice until he
identified himself but then she remembered his voice from the movie
``Body Heat.''
   ``Is this Mrs. Doctor?'' Mrs. Credle quoted Hurt as asking. She
said she told him she was and Hurt said, ``Can I speak to the doctor
about my wife?''
   She said she never met Hurt or Jennings.
   Jennings' claim is based on four weeks she spent with Hurt in
Beaufort, from Dec. 9, 1982, to Jan. 10, 1983, while he was filming
``The Big Chill.''
   Hurt reportedly learned he was divorced from actress Mary Beth
Hurt on Dec. 9, 1982, after seven years of marriage. Jennings argues
that from that day on, a common-law marriage has existed between her
and Hurt although there was never a formal ceremony.
   New York, where the two lived most of the time, does not
recognize common-law marriages.
   Golub said Mrs. Credle's testimony proved Hurt and Jennings were
living as husband and wife in South Carolina, but since Mrs. Credle
could not say for certain that the call came after Dec. 9, 1982, the
value of her testimony is questionable.
   State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann, who is hearing
the trial without a jury, must decide whether a common-law marriage
exists. The judge has indicated that Jennings will have a hard time
proving her case.
   Jennings was on the stand part of Wednesday's court session for
cross-examination, and Hurt's lawyer, Martin Shelton, showed that
her testimony was sometimes inconsistent with earlier sworn
statements.
   For example, she once said Hurt had her sign a prenuptial
agreement on Dec. 3, 1982, in which she forfeited any claims to his
money. She later testified she had learned they signed the agreement
around Christmas that year.
   Hurt testified no agreement was ever signed.
   In a sworn affidavit, Jennings said Hurt told her it would be
unseemly for them to have a civil marriage ceremony with her being
nine months pregnant and everybody thinking they were already
married.
   In court Wednesday, she testified that Hurt had never said
anything about a civil ceremony being unseemly. The trial is
scheduled to resume Thursday.

   A Justice Department spokesman said Wednesday
that President Bush is expected to nominate Robert B. Fiske Jr., who
has come under fire from some conservatives, to be deputy attorney
general.
   Consultation with senators opposed to Fiske has delayed the
formal nomination, said David Runkel, chief spokesman for Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh. Runkel added that ``it is our expectation
that Mr. Fiske will be nominated and confirmed'' by the Senate.
   Runkel said Thornburgh spoke with a number of Republican senators
who signed a letter last week urging Bush not to nominate Fiske. He
declined to identify those speaking with Thornburgh.
   The letter was signed by 14 senators, including Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking GOP member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   It charged that Fiske acted improperly when he chaired the
American Bar Association's judicial screening panel by giving names
of prospective nominees to liberal organizations which then used the
information to mobilize opposition to the candidates.
   The ABA has said that the names were given to the organizations
as part of an effort to determine if the candidates had a history of
bias against women and minorities.
   Asked why Bush has not sent Fiske's name to the Senate, Runkel
said ``there have been questions raised by members of the Senate
concerning the ABA's role in the evaluating the professional
qualificiations'' of judicial candidates.
   ``Some discussions have been going on'' regarding Fiske's role at
the ABA, Runkel said.
   The Justice Department has said that Fiske, a partner in a large
New York law firm and who was once U.S. attorney there, would not be
involved in picking judges for the federal bench.
   Despite the conservative opposition, Bush has indicated he
planned to nominate Fiske. At a gathering of U.S. attorneys Friday
at the White House, Bush said a number of key officeholders in his
administration had been U.S. attorneys.
   ``We hope to see yet another _ Bob Fiske of New York _ joining
our ranks here soon,'' Bush said, without elaborating.

   Hundreds of civil rights veterans and
movement newcomers gathered outside a once-burned rural church
Wednesday to honor three young men who died 25 years ago in the
struggle to register black voters.
   ``We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' said
Secretary of State Dick Molpus, a Philadelphia native. ``We wish we
could bring them back. Every decent person in Philadelphia and
Neshoba County feels that way.''
   The event, held on the grounds of the Methodist church where
James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner had been the
night they were killed by Ku Klux Klansmen, showed that
``Mississippi and America are far different places than they were 25
years ago,'' Gov. Ray Mabus said.
   More than 1,000 people sat in folding chairs placed in the
reddish dust on the church grounds with the hot June sun bearing
down on the nearly three-hour ceremony.
   Attending the ecumenical service at Mount Zion Methodist Church
were relatives of the three slain men and 470 people from
Philadelphia, Pa., and New York whose ``Philadelphia to Philadelphia
Project,'' bus caravan arrived Tuesday in nearby Meridian.
   ``This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' said Rita Schwerner
Bender, Schwerner's widow. ``Sad because it recalls personal pain,
but good because I have the opprtunity _ after all this time _ to
say hello again to many people whose kindess and courage were beyond
explaining.''
   The church has special significance for the civil rights struggle
in Mississippi because it is where Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner had
gone to investigate a fire the day they were killed by Ku Klux
Klansmen.
   The service was part of a daylong series of activities in rural
eastern Mississippi on Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the murders.
   A couple of hours before the service, about 200 people crowded
into tiny Okatibbee Baptist Cemetery near Meridian, where Chaney was
buried.
   Schwerner and Goodman were white civil rights volunteers from the
New York City area. Chaney was a young black man from Meridian.
   They were murdered by white racists in neighboring Neshoba
County. The slayings and attempted coverup by Neshoba County
officials outraged the nation.
   It also was a dramatic and tragic beginning to the so-called
``Mississippi Freedom Summer Project,'' which brought young people
from the North pouring into the state.
   An FBI investigation revealed Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney were
killed by members of the Klan. Their bodies were buried in an
earthen dam near Philadelphia, 40 miles north of Meridian.
   Molpus said state officials hoped to use the event to show the
world there have been many positive changes in Mississippi since the
bloody summer of 1964.
   ``We intend to send a message to the nation that the only thing
burning in Mississippi today is a desire for a better life for all
our people,'' Molpus said, in an oblique reference to the movie
``Mississippi Burning.''
   Mississippi did not bring murder charges in the case. However, 19
Mississipians, most from the Meridian and Philadelphia areas, were
prosecuted under federal statutes for violating the victims' civil
rights.
   Seven men eventually were convicted and an eighth pleaded guilty.
Their prison sentences ranged from three to 10 years prison but the
most any ever served was six years.

<HEAD>Former Federal Agent Says He Was in Team That Killed Journalist</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former federal security agent and onetime
movie actor said Wednesday he was part of a team that killed
newspaper columnist Manuel Buendia in 1984, but he maintained he
does not know who ordered the killing.
   The Mexico City attorney general's office had police arrest
ex-agent Juan Rafael Mora Avila on Tuesday and produced him at a
news conference the next day.
   Mora said he was in a squad that killed Buendia, but said he did
not know what the operation was about.
   ``I'm a career policeman, not a criminal nor a killer,'' Mora,
36, a member of a prominent political family, told reporters.
   He said the triggerman was a police informer named Jose Luis
Ochoa Alonso, nicknamed ``El Chocorrol'' _ a type of chocolate _
because of his dark complexion. He said the man died two months ago.
   Buendia, whose front-page column in the newspaper Excelsior
exposed wrongdoing in high places, was fatally shot May 30, 1984, at
the entrance of a parking garage near his office.
   Mora said he, Ochoa and a police officer met at the now-dissolved
Federal Security Administration, similar to the FBI, the afternoon
Buendia was killed, and set out on motorcycles on a secret operation
to silence a troublemaker.
   He said he remembered hearing shots but did not witness the
killing. ``I didn't know what was happening,'' Mora told reporters.
   Assistant Attorney General Abraham Polo Uzcanga quoted Mora as
saying that after the shooting, Ochoa shouted to him, ``Let's go!''
and they rode away together.
   Ochoa then left Mora a few blocks later, Polo added.
   He quoted Mora as saying he saw Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez,
director of security administration, when he returned to the scene
of the shooting a few minutes later.
   Mora insisted he did not know who ordered the killing.
   Zorrilla was first on the scene, minutes after Buendia was shot,
and conducted the first investigation into the case. He was arrested
June 13 in Mexico City and awaits trial on charges of homicide,
obstructing justice and abuse of authority.
   The attorney general's office called Zorrilla, 47, the mastermind
of the crime and said it is presenting evidence to prove Zorrilla
ordered the killing of Buendia _ his friend of 15 years _ when he
got wind of the columnist's intention to expose his links to
prominent drug traffickers.
   Zorrilla was director of the security administration from 1982
until the government dissolved it for widespread corruption in 1985.
   The government news agency Notimex said Mora is the grandson of
former Puebla state Gov. Maximino Avila Camacho, a onetime Secretary
of Communications and Transportation. It said he was also a
grandnephew of Manuel Avila Camacho, who was president of Mexico
from 1940 to 1946.
   Mora played piano for a rock music group and did bit parts as an
actor in at least four horror and crime B-movies.

   President Carlos Andres Perez on
Wednesday told delegations from 127 nations that the ``economic
totalitarianism'' of the developed world is crushing an increasingly
restive Third World.
   Perez, in a welcoming speech to the U.N. Group of 77, praised the
U.S. Brady plan as an important initiative for relieving the burden
of a $1.3 trillion debt on the Third World.
   ``But we impatiently wait for the concrete gains ... in light of
our urgent situation,'' said Perez.
   Perez's efforts to impose austerity measures in his country,
backed by international creditors, prompted riots in February that
killed about 300 people.
   Similar riots were reported in May in Argentina, another large
contributor to Latin America's $401 billion foreign debt.
   Perez said 40 countries in the underdeveloped world _ with a
combined population of more than 800 million _ faced severe
financial problems because of the debt. He said that since 1982,
those countries signed up to 90 restructuring agreements with banks,
but the banks never agreed to interest rates at or below market
rates.
   ``When we speak of that economic totalitarianism that is forced
on us ... we refer to insensitive attempts to relegate our economic
and social development to immediate needs of fiscal balance in order
to assure the payment of the debt,'' Perez said.
   The plan proposed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on
March 10 encourages banks to forgive a substantial portion of their
loans to heavily indebted countries in return for guarantees that
the rest will be paid. The International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank would furnish the guarantees.
   The Brady plan also calls for economic reforms in debtor
countries in order to receive the benefits of reductions in the debt.
   Perez said developed countries call for belt-tightening for the
poor when they lived beyond their means ``at the expense of the rest
of the world.''
   He castigated the industrialized nations for basing their growth
on ``the destruction of the environment along with an immoral export
of toxic wastes to the Third World.''
   Perez made calls to the Group of 77 to renew the commitment to
economic cooperation within the underdeveloped world, saying such
efforts had flagged under the strain of the debt crisis.
   The group, a non-aligned organization within the U.N. system, was
formed 25 years ago to give underdeveloped nations a forum to push
for changes in the international economy.
   Originally comprised of 77 member nations, the group officially
admitted Mongolia as its 128th member Wednesday.
   The group, meeting until Friday, is expected to call for a better
economic conditions in the light of the increasing impoverishment of
the underdeveloped world and increased economic cooperation between
the underdeveloped nations, said Muchkund Dubey, permanent secretary
of economic affairs of the Indian Foreign Ministry.

   Activists who fought a clash between patriotism
and creativity stemming from an art student's floor display of the
U.S. flag hailed Wednesday's U.S. Supreme Court decision clearing a
flag-burning protester.
   Some Illinois lawmakers, however, said they'll fight on for a law
to punish improper displays of the flag.
   The high court, voting 5-4, threw out the conviction of a
protester sentenced to a year in jail and fined $2,000 for burning
the flag in Texas.
   The court said the flag-burning at a demonstration in Dallas
during the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of
expression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of
speech.
   One Illinois activist said the ruling will discourage passage of
Illinois proposals to prohibit displaying the flag on the floor, but
a sponsor of such a proposal says the Texas case may have little
relevance to Illinois legislation.
   ``Hopefully, it (the ruling) will have some impact on the broader
questions of censorship so prevalent today,'' said Rich Hutchinson,
a member of the No-Mandatory Patriotism Organizing Committee in
Chicago.
   ``No doubt the reactionaries are not all going to go home,'' he
added. ``I think people really need to continue this fight.''
   The committee was formed in support of Scott Tyler, a student at
the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, who provoked angry
protests by displaying a U.S. flag in a work that critics said
invited desecration by encouraging viewers to trample Old Glory.
   Tyler, 24, was less optimistic about the impact of the Supreme
Court ruling.
   ``All these laws are going to pass. In Chicago they already
have,'' Tyler said, referring to an ordinance, enacted the day the
exhibit that included his work was closed, making it illegal to
display a flag on the floor.
   State Sen. Walter Dudycz, sponsor of a state measure to make it a
felony to display the U.S. flag on the floor, said: ``I've spoken to
one attorney who says that the decision regarding the flag case in
Texas is quite different from the one in Chicago. ... We're not sure
yet at all if there is an impact.''
   The School of the Art Institute stood behind Tyler and his work
during its display in February and March, maintaining that First
Amendment rights were at stake.
   ``We weren't overly surprised at the (Supreme Court) decision,''
said Larry Ter Molen, vice president of development and affairs for
the Art Institute of Chicago. ``We certainly hope that people in
Springfield, especially, Senator Dudycz, take this into
consideration.''
   Tyler's work, titled ``What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S.
Flag,'' included a flag spread on the floor in front of a book
soliciting comments from viewers. Also part of the work was a
montage of photographs, some showing flag-draped coffins and South
Koreans burning the flag.

<HEAD>Republicans Ask Ethics Probe of Lukens, One of Their Own</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS graf 14: ``Meanwhile, Lukens,'' with Lukens polyp diagnosed

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans, seeking to keep the ethics
high ground against the Democrats, took the unprecedented step
Wednesday of triggering an investigation of one of their own: Rep.
Donald E. Lukens of Ohio.
   The action on Lukens, who was convicted last month on charges
involving sex with a 16-year-old girl, came on a show of hands in a
closed-door meeting of the Republican Conference, the organization
of all GOP House members.
   Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., sought in a statement to
portray the move as part of a Republican ``total commitment to
standards of behavior for members of Congress which reflect
honorably on the institution and the nation.''
   However, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the
Republicans seemed to be trying to score ``a political point ...
apparently at the expense of one of their own members.'' He said any
GOP attempt to make ethics a partisan issue was ``absolute nonsense
and the public knows it.''
   The House ethic committee, formally the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, had been expected to investigate Lukens anyway. If
the committee finds him to have violated House rules it could
recommend penalties ranging from a reprimand to expulsion.
   Republicans have set ethics reform in the House among their top
priorities for the 101st Congress. And their political operatives
hope to capitalize in the next elections by pointing to the
resignations of Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and
Whip Tony Coelho of California in the face of ethics allegations.
   But Lukens' conviction on May 30 in Franklin County, Ohio, of
contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor, has been
an embarrassment to his own party. A jury found Lukens guilty of the
misdemeanor charge based on its conclusion that he had sex with the
girl at his Columbus apartment last November. Lukens, 58 and
divorced, is appealing the conviction.
   One member of the GOP leadership, Rep. Robert Walker of
Pennsylvania, sought to use Wednesday's move to turn up the heat on
Democrats, suggesting they might do well to put the ethics spotlight
on their own bad apples.
   ``We have taken that step of asking for an investigation,''
Walker said. ``I think it's an appropriate kind of step to suggest
that the other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of
tough thing that is involved in what our conference did today.''
   Newly elected Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer of Maryland
retorted when told of Walker's comment: ``I'm sure Democrats are
prepared to kick out their own members who are convicted of sexually
abusing children.''
   Although Lukens has announced he will seek re-election, Ohio
state GOP chairman Robert Bennett has said he will not be on the
party's ticket in 1990, and the senior member of the state's GOP
House delegation, Rep. Chalmers Wylie, has said Lukens ``should do
the gentlemanly thing and resign.''
   Lukens has vowed to fight, and his spokesman said Wednesday's
action was welcome because an ethics probe could ``once and for all
bring forth the truth about this entire episode.''
   The spokesman, William Jarrell, said Lukens was hampered in court
because he was not permitted to cast doubt on the motives and
credibility of the girl and her mother, who were Lukens' accusers.
``Now we'll be able to bring forth the background and the motives,''
he said.
   Meanwhile, Lukens learned Wednesday that a polyp removed from his
colon was benign. Spokesman Jarrell said Lukens was in good health
and the throat cancer diagnosed in 1984 remains in remission.
   In presenting the Republican resolution, Michel said it was
unprecedented for the conference to call for an ethics probe of one
of its own members.
   The document asks the ethics panel to ``determine whether Rep.
Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens failed to conduct himself at all times in a
manner which reflects creditably on the House of Representatives.''
   It notes that House members, ``in order to perform their
constitutional duties, must conduct themselves with integrity'' and
that House rules require conduct which will not bring disrepute on
the institution.
   Michel said the GOP will live up to its constitutional obligation
to police its own members ``no matter how distasteful or painful.''

   President Bush, continuing to trumpet his
theme of volunteerism, called Wednesday for more Americans to donate
time to help protect national parks and other natural resources.
   ``It is time to renew our commitments, both to nature and to our
fellow man,'' Bush said at a convention of recreational vehicle
owners. He spoke to a crowd of several thousand people.
   Bush, offering no new specifics, outlined to the Family Motor
Coach Association the environmental proposals he has submitted to
Congress.
   ``We need to get the word out, that our national parks and other
federal land management agencies depend on volunteers,'' Bush said.
``This is just the kind of voluntary, local effort it will take to
bring us into a better partnership with nature.''
   After speaking at a muddy fairgrounds, the president addressed a
crowd of some 2,000 Republicans at a $100-a-plate unity banquet.
Praising Republican Marshall Coleman for his gubernatorial primary
victory, Bush jokingly offered Coleman some ``free advice.''
   ``Don't film your TV ads riding around in a tank,'' said Bush,
referring to an ad made by Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis that Bush frequently made fun of during his election
campaign last year.
   The president said Virginia would be ``a battleground between the
parties in the 1990s'' and called Coleman ``a trailblazer.''
   Coleman won a hard-fought GOP primary last week by defeating
former Sen. Paul Trible and Rep. Stan Paris. He will face Democratic
Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder in November.
   Bush called the GOP primary a ``rough and tumble competition,''
but said ``now that the dust has settled, we are all still
Republicans.''
   ``We will take our Republican message _ a message of hope and
opportunity _ to the black and other minority voters of Virginia,''
Bush said in comments apparently designed to undercut support for
Wilder, who could become the nation's first elected black governor.
   In his speech to the motor coach group, Bush sought support for
his environmental proposals to increase federal spending on
recreational land acquisition by $200 million in 27 states, and for
a like amount in new funding for wetlands acquisition.
   On another program, Bush said his administration would identify
by the end of the week 25 new ``back-country byways'' for federal
protection to add to the existing 43 National Forest Scenic Byways.
   ``I want to preserve ... those picturesque roads that offer power
views of the nation's natural splendor,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   A commuter is suing the New Jersey Highway
Authority for $20.35 because its discount tokens were always sold
out, and when he did manage to buy some, they sold him a slug.
   ``If you've got a mule, the only way you can get it to do
something is to get its attention first,'' Paul Schlichtman said
Wednesday. ``I'm filing the suit to get their attention, then I'm
going to get them to do something _ give me the money they owe me.''
   Five times last week he tried to buy rolls of tokens for the
Garden State Parkway at the Essex toll plaza, and every time he was
told they were sold out, he said. A roll of 40 tokens costs $10, a
savings of $4. Beginning next month $10 will buy only 30 tokens.
   The 35 cents demanded in the suit is for a slug Schlichtman says
the Highway Authority sold him in a roll of tokens he was able to
buy. A toll collector refused to reimburse him for the slug, he said.
   Schlichtman's says his case is solid. He collected receipts every
time he was told there were no tokens and he has the names of the
toll booth employees.
   Schlichtman, a South Orange resident who works in New York City,
said he spends about $1,000 a year on highway tolls.
   ``Toll booths are a major part of my life,'' he said. ``I spend
more time sitting at toll booths than I do with any other part of my
day. They're ridiculous and obnoxious.''
   Highway Authority spokesman Dennis Ingoglia said the agency would
not comment on the case because it was in litigation.
   But he said motorists who are sold slugs can either mail the
slugs to the Highway Authority for a refund, or get a refund at a
toll plaza administration building. Toll collectors are not
permitted to make refunds, he said.

<HEAD>Government Liquidates Five Brokerages In Wake of Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday closed five
stock brokerages caught in the biggest scandal in the Brazilian
market's history.
   Among the houses liquidated was Capitanea Distribuidora, owned by
Elmo Camoes, who Monday quit as president of the Central Bank,
Brazil's equivalent to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   Camoes owns 99 percent of the brokerage, which was caught short
in the unprecedented scandal allegedly caused by the speculation of
a single investor, multimillionaire businessman Naji Nahas.
   The liquidations, signed by acting Bank president Wadico Bucchi,
also included the brokerages Ney Carvalho, Celton, Titular and Beta.
The five houses ran up a debt equivalent to $64 million.
   Nahas, 42, the No. 1 investor in Brazil's $30 billion stock
market, bounced checks worth $31 million to several brokerages used
to purchase stock futures, said the Brazilian Securities Commission.
   Nahas had borrowed heavily to invest in blue-chip stocks, taking
advantage of a rule that allowed him to pay five days later, said
the commission, which is the rough equivalent to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   Meanwhile, he pumped up the stock's price by buying large amounts
of common stock, meaning the shares he received later were worth
more. When banks restricted credit for that type of operation,
Nahas' checks to several brokerages were returned for lack of funds.
   A judge in Sao Paulo, the nation's financial center, on Tuesday
rejected a request by a prosecutor for the arrest of Nahas, ruling
there was not enough evidence to show he was responsible for stock
manipulation. But the Justice Ministry has barred Nahas from leaving
the country.
   There are nine stock exchanges in Brazil, and Nahas had been
playing principally on the Rio market. Rio and Sao Paulo are the
principal exchanges.
   The Monday after the scandal broke on June 9th, the commission
declared a one-day stock market holiday to prevent panic among
investors, but the government refused to bail out the brokerages or
the Rio Exchange.
   On Saturday, Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange President Sergio
Barcellos announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence.
   The scandal prompted an investigation of 29 brokerages by the

   A privately financed group studying
preparations for the Nicaraguan election questioned Wednesday
whether the council appointed by the Sandinista government to
oversee the campaign and balloting will be fair.
   The Bipartisan Commission on Free and Fair Elections said the
appointment of Mariano Faillos, a member of the ruling party, as
president of the Supreme Electoral Council ``raises questions about
the independence'' of the five-member panel.
   In addition, the group said, it ``would have improved the
composition'' of the body if both of the two members representing
the political opposition had been drawn from Nicaragua's ``Group of
14'' opposition parties.
   Instead, President Daniel Ortega nominated and the Nicaraguan
National Assembly appointed Aman Sandino, a member of the Democratic
Conservative Party, to one of the two slots.
   Leaders of the ``Group of 14'' do not recognize the Democratic
Conservatives as an opposition party, but consider them allied with
the governing Sandinistas.
   Nevertheless, the commission said, Sandino is considered a
dissident in his own party and ``some say this proves Sandino's
sufficient independence'' from the Sandinistas.
   ``Given these perspectives, it is uncertain at this point whether
the five appointments are balanced and fair,'' the commission said.
   Curtin Winsor Jr., co-chairman of the commission, who was
ambassador to Costa Rica during the Reagan administration, said the
commission hopes to meet with the electoral council soon and has
applied for visas to enter Nicaragua sometime this summer.
   On June 12, the State Department accused Nicaragua of trying to
restrict foreign monitoring of the balloting by requiring Americans
_ for the first time _ to acquire entry visas as of July 1.
   The commission released letters it has written to President Bush
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III asking for an opportunity
to brief them on its work.
   Former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., the other co-chairman of the
commission, said the group would request a meeting with Ortega and
had begun efforts to meet with other Central American presidents.
   Nelson said a number of trips to Nicaragua were planned,
beginning in late July or early August and continuing through the
elections that are to be held in February under an agreement between
Ortega and the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and
Honduras.
   Margarita Suarez, press officer for the Nicaraguan Embassy, said
she assumed the visas would be granted, but ``the official position
is that the only people who will be allowed to be observers are
those that have been invited to be observers by the government.''
   ``There is really no restrictions on the visas, unless someone is
really undesirable,'' Ms. Suarez said. ``There is no new
qualification that people must go through simply because they are
Americans.''
   Ms. Suarez said the embassy had not yet received a copy of the
commission's report.
   The commission said its proposals were ``but the minimal
requirements for a free and fair electoral campaign and election.''
   ``They are consistent with Central American practices and are by
no means ideal standards or an attempt to impose U.S. practices on
Nicaragua,'' the panel said.
   The commission, which held hearings here May 9-11, is sponsored
by the conservative World Freedom Foundation.
   The group said that ``international observers, press, and
broadcast media must have the right to travel throughout the country
during the campaign to monitor the electoral process.''
   It said polling must be permitted, there must be ``reasonable
opposition access'' to press, radio and television, and laws giving
the government censorship and control over media outlets must be
suspended during the campaign.
   It proposed that Nicaragua, which has no voter registration
system, establish one by the beginning of the campaign on Sept. 1.
   Although few countries in Latin America allow absentee voting,
the commission said a significant number of Nicaraguans now live
abroad in exile and ``fairness calls for some form of participation
by these people in deciding their homeland's future.''

<TEXT>
   After years of touring the world, winning rave
reviews in dozens of languages and being the first major American
ballet company to tour the Soviet Union, the Dance Theater of Harlem
opened its 20th anniversary season Wednesday night with a
performance of ``Giselle.''
   Arthur Mitchell, executive director and co-founder of the
company, spoke before the start of the perfomance, thanking the City
Center audience for its support and the city of New York for a $2.5
million grant that will be used to renovate the Harlem facility and
other properties.
   ``The fact that we have survived and gotten here in 20 years is a
miracle,'' Mitchell said.
   Dancer-choreographer-actor-designer Geoffrey Holder and his wife,
the dancer Carmen DeLavallade, congratulated Mitchell and the
company during opening ceremonies to celebrate the anniversary.
   Holder said the company was ``an inspired idea'' and that
Mitchell had a lot of courage.
   ``Arthur is a gem cutter,'' said Miss DeLavallade. ``He went into
a Harlem garage with all these wonderful jewels and formed a crown
and placed it in Harlem.''
   Two decades ago, the talented and brash principal dancer from the
New York City Ballet sliced through the racial barriers that had
kept blacks from succeeding in classical ballet and founded the
vibrant and youthful company. Mitchell, who retired from the City
Ballet in 1970, has led the troupe to international renown, but has
kept its roots firmly planted in Harlem.
   The original dance school remains in the primarily black uptown
Manhattan neighborhood, and many of this season's New York
performances will be held in Aaron Davis Hall at City College.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem prides itself on preserving American
dance repertory, and does an excellent job of presenting works that
otherwise would disappear because they are not performed. The
company also demonstrates a variety of styles and moods, from the
classical ``Swan Lake'' to the neoclassical ``Serenade'' to the
contemporary and ethnic ``Dougla'' to the folk ballet ``John Henry.''
   Last year, the troupe captivated audiences in the Soviet Union
with its magical retelling of John Taras' stunning ``Firebird,'' set
to the original Igor Stravinsky score.
   The company's ``Giselle,'' which had its New York premiere in
1984 after a London debut, is a departure from the traditional work
set in Austria. This ``Giselle'' takes place in Louisiana in the
years following the Civil War. It is as creole as crawfish and
gumbo, and just as luscious with its mossy sets and pastel costumes.
   Frederic Franklin, who danced with the Ballet Russe de Monte
Carlo from the 1930s-'50s, staged the ballet for the company without
departing too much from the choreography by Jean Coralli and Jules
Perrot.
   The lithe Virginia Johnson, the company's prima ballerina, danced
the title role of the young woman who dies of unrequited love. She
was partnered with Eddie J. Shellman, who is paired with her in many
of the company's works. Shellman, whose barrel turns and leaps have
made him a stand-out in the troupe, portrayed the callous suitor,
Albert.
   Miss Johnson displayed a wonderful technical astuteness en
pointe. And Judy Tyrus, who will dance the lead on June 25, was
perky and refreshing in her pas de deux with Augustus van Heerden.
   During its New York run through July 2, the Dance Theater of
Harlem will perform works from its repertoire, including
Balanchine's ``Allegro Brillante,'' Mitchell's ``Holberg Suite'' and
Glen Tetley's ``Voluntaries.'' The company also will premiere works
by Nijinska.

   The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Michigan
Republican activist Peter Secchia as ambassador to Italy despite
concerns by some that his penchant for vulgar language might lead
him into diplomatic hot water.
   Secchia, dubbed by some Italian publications as ``the ambassador
of dirty words,'' pledged during confirmation hearings before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he would clean up his
language while serving as a diplomat.
   But Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., expressed concern that
Secchia would be unable to do that, saying he feared the nominee
would embarrass President Bush and the United States.
   Pell abstained on the vote.
   Secchia, a multimillionaire timber executive who served as a GOP
national committeeman, is credited by Bush loyalists for engineering
Bush's victory in the Michigan 1988 caucuses over the Rev. Pat
Robertson.
   Others confirmed later in the day were:
   _Former Indiana Gov. Robert D. Orr as ambassador to Singapore.
   _Morton Abramowitz of Washington, a career Foreign Service
officer, as ambassador to Turkey.
   _ Edward N. Ney of New York as ambassador to Canada.

   Rock 'n' roll relics are dusting off
their guitars and banging their drums quickly for a spate of reunion
tours this summer, starting with Wednesday's debut of The Who
talking 'bout their generation.
   The Who, which splintered after a ``farewell tour'' in 1982,
reassembled at the small Glen Falls Civic Center in upstate New York
arena with a series of songs from the nearly two-decade-old rock
opera, ``Tommy.''
   The Who is just one group planning a revival in the coming
months. The Rolling Stones will be touring this fall and former
Beatle Ringo Starr is going on his first solo tour, as will veterans
like Billy Preston, Joe Walsh, Clarence Clemons and former Band
members.
   Other bands from the 1970s that had long since broken up, such as
the Doobie Brothers and the Allman Brothers, are planning reunion
tours.
   The Who have scheduled concerts in 36 stadiums across the country
this summer in a tour marking the band's 25th anniversary. They'll
also do two special charity performances of ``Tommy'' at indoor
venues in New York and Los Angeles.
   It all started Wednesday when Pete Townshend, dressed in a baggy
gray suit with his hair swept back in a ponytail, grimaced as he
sang a high note in ``1921,'' one of ``Tommy's'' opening songs.
   A crowd of slightly more than 5,000 roared when singer Roger
Daltrey shattered one pair of tambourines and then tossed it aside.
   A giant video screen designed for stadiums beamed close-ups of
the band and a series of colorful flags stitched together served as
a stage backdrop.
   In a three-hour show, The Who performed their classics ``Who Are
You,'' ``Substitute,'' ``My Generation,'' ``Won't Get Fooled
Again,'' and ``Baba O'Riley.'' They played 38 songs and two acts.
   A June 23 show in Toronto, the city where the band played its
last show in 1982, was originally scheduled to be the tour opener.
But the band added Wednesday night's performance as a warm up.
   The band's tour has been criticized by some in the music
community, who note that members Townshend, John Entwistle and
Daltrey haven't had nearly the same financial success with
individual tours and records as they did with The Who.
   The cover of the current Musician magazine, for instance, shows a
drawing of the three band members as the centerpiece of a large
dollar bill.
   Tickets sales have indeed been brisk. Tickets here sold out
within 82 minutes of being offered for sale.
   The three remaining original members of the band were
supplemented by drummer Simon Phillips, keyboard player John
Bundrick and guitarist Steve Bolton.
   The band has no new album out but they plan to release the record
``The Iron Man'' next month.

<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake was felt in a wide
area of Northern California late Wednesday afternoon, but there were
no reports of damages or injuries.
   The temblor had a magnitude estimated at 4.2 on the Richter scale
by the University of California at Berkeley Seismographic Stations.
Its epicenter was in Pittsburg, about 40 miles northeast of San
Francisco.
   ``You may get a few things knocked off of shelves, but that's
about all that's going to happen,'' said Berkeley seismologist
Robert Uhrhammer.
   Telephone interviews indicated the quake was felt in San
Francisco north to Vacaville and as far east as Stockton.
   ``The whole house seemed like it briefly shifted,'' said Julie
Scarpelli, who lives in a house on stilts in the Berkeley hills.
``It seemed like someone took a hammer to the house.''
   Only a few calls from concerned residents were received at
Vacaville's police department, said a spokeswoman.
   ``It was rolling and rolling,'' added Concord police dispatcher
Pat Hattwick, who said the department received numerous calls on the
quake.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seisomograph.
   A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while
a quake of 6.0 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Military Agrees on Talks to End Political Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military has agreed to participate
in talks toward ending the political crisis involving Defense Forces
chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the government said Wednesday.
   The military will be included in the government delegation,
Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said in a letter to Jorge Baena
Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of American States.
   The talks among the government, military and opposition were
proposed last week by an OAS mission, which has made two trips to
Panama since the government annulled a May election that foreign
observers said the opposition won handily. The government had
insisted that Noriega, the country's de facto leader, was ``not
negotiable.'' But Wednesday's Foreign Ministry statement, which
included excerpts from Ritter's letter, made no mention of Noriega.
   Ritter's letter was apparently an effort to circumvent a deadlock
caused by Noriega' insistence the military had nothing to do with
politics. Noriega had said talks to resolve the crisis should be
between the government and the opposition.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma's government reiterates ``its
decision to take part in a dialogue between Panamanians to try
overcome the grave problems confronting'' the nation, Ritter's
letter said.
   The government will be represented by ``the executive branch,
which includes the Defense Forces,'' it added.
   In the letter, Ritter indicated the OAS should help draw up an
agenda for the talks ``on the basis of a concensus among those
taking part ... to serve as a basis for discussion of the Panamanian
nation's problems.''
   Opposition groups demanding that Noriega step down said last week
they were willing to take part in the talks.
   Noriega was indicted in 1988 by federal grand juries in Florida
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Efforts by the
United States to oust him, including economic sanctions against
Panama, have failed.
   Noriega had the legislature, which he controlled, fire President
Eric Arturo Delvalle in February 1988, a day after Delvalle tried to
fire Noriega. The legislature then named Education Minister Solis
Palma acting president, but the U.S. has insisted on recognizing
Delvalle as Panama's legitimate president.
   The crisis deepened when the government claimed its candidate
Carlos Duque of the National Liberation Coalition won the
presidential election May 7.
   Opposition groups and foreign observers including several from
the United States, said there was widespread fraud in the election
and that the opposition candidate, Guillermo Andara of the
Democratic Civilian Alliance, won by a 3-to-1 margin.
   As the crisis grew, a government-controlled election board
annulled the election. The government had planned to install the new
president on Sept. 1.
   The OAS, called in to try solve the crisis, sent a delegation of
top diplomats late in May, then a second one last week, to try and
get the government, the military and the opposition to negotiate.
   The delegation, headed by Baena Soares, included foreign
ministers Diego Cordovez of Ecuador, Mario Palencia of Guatemala and
Sahadeo Basdeo of Trinidad-Tobago.

   Chinese students across the nation have sent a
letter to Congress urging stricter sanctions against their homeland,
and to express their impatience with the Bush Administration's
response to the Beijing killings.
   ``What bothers me is not what is being done, but what is being
said,'' said Pei Min Xin, a graduate student at Harvard University
who helped draft the letter.
   ``Secretary of State (James A.) Baker says we should treat this
relationship as a very important one to preserve. But for all
intents and purposes, the relationship is dead and gone,'' he said
Wednesday.
   The letter, co-signed by Chinese student organizations from 68
American universities _ including Harvard and Yale University,
Bush's alma mater _ and Scotland's University of Edinburgh, says
economic and diplomatic sanctions against the hard-line Chinese
government can be as effective as U.S. sanctions were against
Poland's communist regime.
   ``(Congress) should now take the lead in promoting `universal
respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms'
by themselves imposing sanctions against the goverment of Deng
Xiaoping and by urging America's allies to do the same,'' the letter
said.
   The organizations that signed it represent more than 7,000
Chinese students, said Pei, who Tuesday appeared before U.S. House's
subcommittee on international banking and outlined the letter's
proposed economic sanctions.
   Pei, a 31-year-old political science student, said the United
States' relationship with China is outdated despite Bush's personal
interest in the country where he formerly served as ambassador.
   ``The relationship was built on a common fear of the Soviet
Union,'' said Pei. ``The threat from the Soviet Union has diminished
a great deal toward the West and the United States, and has
disappeared against China.''
   The letter calls for the following steps if the Chinese
government does not ``cease and desist from further atrocities'':
   _The removal of China's ``Most Favored Nation'' trade status.
   _Freezing all credit to China from the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank.
   _Reimposing restrictions on exports to China regulated by the
Commerce Department.
   ``These sanctions must remain in place until martial law is
lifted and all reprisals against the leaders and supporters of the
pro-democracy moveent are terminated,'' the letter said.
   If China continues to arrest the demonstrators and does not
commute the death sentences imposed on some, the Chinese students
propose:
   _The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations should call for
emergency sessions of the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly.
   _Ending all credit guarantees against China.
   _Suspension of the procession of China's application to
membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
intertional trade body.
   On Wednesday, the Chinese government executed three men for their
roles in the student-led protests that ended when the army moved
against students and supporters in Beijing on June 3-4, killing up
to 3,000 people, according to some estimates.

   Joseph A. Bevilacqua, whose lifelong

career as Rhode Island's top legislator and top judge, died
Wednesday. He was 70.
   Bevilacqua was elected to the Rhode Island House in 1954 and
maintained a successful criminal law practice while he rose through
the ranks to become majority leader in 1966 and speaker in 1969.
   Questions about his ties to criminals came into the open when the
General Assembly elected him chief justice of the state Supreme
Court in 1976. Investigations were conducted, and in 1985 Bevilacqua
was censured by the Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline for

   Calhoun was the head track and field coach at Western Illinois

   He was the first man to win successive Olympic hurdle titles. His
first came in the 110-meter hurdles at the 1956 Games at Melbourne,
when as a virtual unknown he slipped past heavily favored teammate
Jack Davis in a photo finish and his time of 13.5 seconds
established an Olympic record.
   Four years later at Rome, Calhoun again needed a photo finish to
nip teammate Willie May by one one-hundreth of a second for his
second gold medal.
   The Laurel, Miss. native was a seven-time national champion and
also held world records in the 110-, 50-, 60- and 70-meter hurdles.

   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm plans to welcome
super collider managers to Texas the day before the House votes on
building the particle accelerator, and an upset Democrat from the
state charged Wednesday that could jeopardize as-yet unvoted funds
for the $4.4 billion project.
   ``It will be hurtful to us, for members of Congress to be reading
Gramm is gloating over the (collider) at the same time we are trying
against a lot of odds to protect the gains we have made so far on
this project,'' said Rep. John Bryant.
   ``This is a time in which we need to be careful and humble,
rather than to be seen as bragging.''
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said Tuesday's ribbon-cutting at the
Energy Department's new super collider offices in DeSoto, a Dallas
suburb, is intended to generate local support.
   ``Fully 50 percent of the gains that Texas has made on the SSC
are directly attributed to the senator,'' Neal said.
   ``Congressman Bryant's history on the (collider) is one of
refusing to become involved, of offering no support and of finally
whining at length when he was required to take some action,'' while
Gramm is at least
   The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday voted $200 million
for the project in the new budget, $110 million of which is the
first substantial slice of construction money.
   Bryant said there may be an attempt to strike the $200 million in
floor debate next Wednesday, the day after the ribbon cutting in
DeSoto. There is substantial opposition to the project in the House
from members who believe its vast cost will starve other, equally
worthy scientific research.
   ``We are certainly a long ways from being out of the woods on
this project,'' Bryant said. ``Gramm's zeal for getting headlines
for himself could endanger a critical Texas project.''
   Henry Gandy, director of the Texas office of state-federal
relations, said, ``I don't think it will affect the vote in the
House.''
   Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican whose district includes the super
collider site, called Gramm's visit appropriate the complaints ``a
tempest in a teapot.''

   Police fired tear gas and beat
protesters with truncheons to break up a rally Wednesday by hundreds
of students demanding that private tuition fees be rolled back,
witnesses said. At least 11 students were arrested.
   Witnesses said they saw scores of protesters hit in the head and
other parts of the body during the baton charge, but there were no
immediate reports of serious injuries.
   Police charged the demonstrators, who numbered about 2,000, when
they ignored repeated warnings to disperse peacefully after their
permit to hold a rally in front of the Department of Education
expired at 6 p.m., the witnesses said.
   Police said they planned to release the 11 arrested students
after an investigation to determine if they should be charged with
illegal assembly, a misdemeanor.
   The students were protesting a 15 percent tuition increase at
private schools this month, the beginning of the school year. With
the increase, annual tuition runs $95 on average for private
elementary and high schools and about $145 at colleges.
   Per capita income in the Philippines is about $600 a year.

<HEAD>Federal Investigators Want To Retrieve Cargo Door That Blew Off United

   Federal investigators have asked the Navy to
retrieve a cargo door that tore off a Boeing 747 jet over the
Pacific Ocean nearly four months ago, sending nine passengers to
their deaths.
   The door is believed to be resting on the ocean floor more than
three miles underwater and about 85 miles southwest of Honolulu.
United and Boeing, which would share in the cost, said they support
the recovery effort.
   The National Transportation Safety Board asked the Navy to search
for the door, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said Tuesday. The Navy
said Wednesday it has not received a formal request.
   United has encouraged the NTSB to look for the door, said
spokesman Rob Doughty.
   ``We're glad they've made that decision,'' Doughty said. ``It may
answer some questions that may be lingering.''
   Doughty said he didn't know when the search would be made, but
ABC said Tuesday it's scheduled for October.
   NTSB investigators have said retrieving the door would help
determine what caused it to pop open at an altitude of 22,000 feet
on Feb. 24, ripping a 10-by-20-foot hole in the fuselage. But
recovering it is not considered essential, Lopatkiewicz said.
   The jumbo jet was flying from Honolulu to Auckland, New Zealand,
when the accident occurred. The pilots managed to return to Honolulu
with the 345 people still aboard.

   American and Soviet mountaineers who plan to climb
Mount Everest to promote peace and environmentalism met their
Chinese counterparts Wednesday, and tried to sidestep questions
about China's troubles.
   ``We don't know a lot about politics, but I think we all know a
little bit about mountain climbing,'' Jim Whittaker, leader of the
Mount Everest Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb, told a news
conference at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   ``We come here for the peace of the world,'' Chinese delegation
leader Liu Da Yi said through an interpreter. ``We hope to have good
cooperation.''
   Chinese mountaineers in the 30-member climbing team were delayed
more than a week in reaching the United States for practice climbing
on Mount Rainier because of restrictions on travel in China
following the military crackdown there.
   The team, comprised of 10 citizens of each country, plans to head
for Mount Rainier on Saturday after planning sessions and a
fund-raising reception.
   Whittaker said the team will train at least through Tuesday at a
base camp and a high-level camp that have been established on the
14,410-foot peak 60 miles southeast of Seattle.
   The climb next year is intended to show that people from the
three nations can work together to reach the highest point on Earth,
said Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to stand atop
Everest. He said it's the first time mountaineers from the three
countries have joined in a major climb.
   ``We will stand on the summit of Everest, three people, one from
each country, with our arms around each other because we are
brothers, not only under one sun, but brothers as mountain
climbers,'' he said.
   The group will try to get as many climbers as possible to the
summit of the 29,028-foot Himalayan mountain, he added.
   The mountaineers hope to get the first team onto the peak on
April 22, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, Whittaker said.
   The expedition plans to pack its own trash down the mountain and
bring out as much trash from previous climbs as possible. Greenpeace
and other environmental groups have volunteered to help remove
waste, Whittaker said.
   The climbers plan to approach the mountain's north side through
China and Tibet. The cost of the expedition was put at $1 million,
and Whittaker said additional sponsors were being sought.
   Pressed about the turmoil in China, Whittaker said he welcomed
the publicity it drew to the expedition.
   ``We'd like the events of the past few weeks to focus on this
group of citizens that are working together for a common goal of
peace, and the human environment,'' he said.
   ``I think there is even more reason for this group to be
together. We had no idea that those problems would occur.''
   But, Whittaker said, the expedition ``is even more important for
the citizens of this world ... When we rope up on that mountain we
are trusting our lives to each other. I think we have to do that as
countries.''
   The Chinese delegation leader said the Chinese recognize the
American and Soviet climbers are more experienced. ``We will be the
pupils.''
   Soviet leader Vladimir Shatayev said he was eager to get back to
mountain climbing. ``We're happy our Chinese friends have come to
climb,'' he said through an interpreter.

   More than 42,000 coal miners in 10
states took part in wildcat strikes Wednesday that spread in
Appalachia and the Midwest. Reports of violence and blockades
mounted as coal companies sought relief from the courts.
   ``It looks like the bulk of the industry is shut down,'' said
Taylor Pensoneau, vice president of the Illinois Coal Association.
   More than 7,000 miners in Illinois and 700 in Ohio joined the
wildcat strike Wednesday in sympathy with about 1,900 United Mine
Workers members striking Pittston Coal Group Inc. in West Virginia,
Virginia and Kentucky. More than 4,000 additional workers in
Pennsylvania also walked off the job.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp hit six UMW locals with fines of
$2,500 each for defying a back-to-work order sought by Island Creek
Corp., and a Virginia judge fined the union $300,000 for violating
his rules on picketing.
   In Alabama, three coal companies filed complaints against UMW
members in a bid to get miners back to work.
   West Virginia police said there have been sporadic reports of
minor violence in the state's southern coal fields in the past few
days.
   Several hundred UMW members refusing to work converged on the
southern Virginia coal fields and used convoy tactics to block the
entrances to Pittston processing plants. More than 200 cars and
pickups drove up and down the roads in front of the plant entrances.
   In addition, about 800 camouflage-clad coal miners from a
half-dozen states converged on the state Capitol in Richmond, Va.,
to pledge support for the Pittston strikers.
   There still was no indication when the unauthorized walkouts
might end, even though three jailed strike organizers were released
in Virginia on Tuesday and a two-week vacation period is scheduled
to start for thousands of miners at midnight Friday.
   ``It's just a day-by-day thing,'' said Danny Wells, an incoming
executive board member of Charleston, W.Va.-based District 17. ``As
far as what might happen down the road there's just nobody that can
predict that.''
   Wells said miners are upset with huge fines levied against the
union in Virginia and the lack of negotiations between Pittston and
the UMW.
   In Illinois, a strike that had been limited to a Wabash Couny
mine owned by AMAX Coal Co. spread to at least 40 sites, affecting
12 major coal companies, union officials said.
   Central Ohio Coal Co. miners failed to show for work at the Ohio
Power Co. subsidary with operations in four counties, while another
120 failed to show at Peabody Coal's Simco mine.
   More than 100 miners showed up at U.S. District Court in
Charleston, where Knapp fined the six locals. In addition, he
threatened to fine the locals $500 apiece for each day they fail to
comply with the back-to-work order. He also fined the locals'
officers $200 and each union member $50, with the penalties to
increase by $50 a day for each day they remain in violation.
   Howard Green, a UMW international executive board member, said
the 190 Island Creek miners showed up for work Tuesday but
encountered pickets and refused to cross the line.
   In Indiana, Old Ben Coal Co. asked a federal judge to find miners
striking two locations in contempt for disobeying a back-to-work
order. The strike has affected about 240 Old Ben Coal workers.
   In Tazewell County, Va., Circuit Judge N.E. Persin ruled the
union was responsible for picket line misconduct that resulted in
coal trucks being the targets of objects thrown at several coal
operations.
   About 100 miners converged on U.S. District Court in Clarksburg,
W.Va., where Consolidation Coal Co. was seeking a back-to-work order
for miners at six union locals in north central West Virginia.
Consolidation officials have indicated they plan similar action for
wildcat sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
   After a day of testimony, U.S. District Judge William Kidd
recessed the hearing until Thursday afternoon.
   In Alabama, Jim Walter Resources filed a suit in federal court at
Birmingham seeking unspecified damages from UMW and its District 20.
U.S. Steel Mining Co. and Drummond Co. Inc. filed complaints with
the National Labor Relations Board.
   The windshield of a truck was broken when the vehicle was struck
by five .22-caliber rifle bullets in Walker County on Tuesday. The
driver was not hit.
   Gunshots were fired Wednesday afternoon at a guard shack at the
Logan-Mingo Mine Co. office near Gilbert, but no one was wounded,
said West Virginia state Trooper Ric Robinson.
   West Virginia state police Superintendent J.R. Buckalew said
there have been sporadic reports of minor violence in the state,
mainly ``hoodlum-type people who do their business hidden in the
leaves or in the darkness.''
   According to union and industry officials, the estimated number
of miners involved Wednesday in unauthorized walkouts are: West
Virginia, 16,000; Illinois, 8,000; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio, 2,660;
Pennsylvania, 6,600; Indiana 1,750; Kentucky, 1,500; Virginia, 755;
Missouri, 350; and Tennessee, 200.

   Exxon Corp. and other big oil companies say
they'll spend $250 million over five years to sharpen their ability
to combat massive oil spills, and the Bush administration is
stepping up surveillance of the Alaska oil system.
   The major oil companies, in their first comprehensive step to
improve contingency planning for big spills, said Tuesday they will
create a nationwide network of response teams capable of handling an
accident as large as the Exxon Valdez disaster anywhere on U.S.
coastal waters.
   The plan is voluntary, which environmental groups and some
members of Congress said minimizes its importance and underscores
the need for federal legislation to require better response
capabilities.
   ``When it comes to the protection of our fragile environment,
`good faith' simply is not good enough,'' said Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, D-Conn. He said he will introduce legislation Thursday to
increase oil companies' financial liability for oil spills.

   Oliver L. North's sentencing is postponed while
the judge considers defense charges that one of the Iran-Contra
jurors who convicted the former White House aide deliberately lied
during jury selection.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell postponed Friday's
scheduled sentencing after North's lawyers produced evidence that
juror Tara King failed to disclose that a brother had been convicted
of armed robbery and that two others had arrest records.
   The defense also alleged that Ms. King's statements to reporters
after the verdict that she used marijuana and cocaine before the
trial suggests she was under the influence of drugs during the trial.
   Ms. King told interviewers that she did not use drugs during her
jury service.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. moved toward
resolving securities fraud charges against it when a judge approved
an unprecedented civil settlement between the Wall Street firm and
the government.
   The pact with the Securities and Exchange Commission places the
nation's fifth-largest securities firm under strict supervision and
requires Drexel to sever ties with its former junk bond chief,
Michael Milken.
   Approval of the settlement Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Milton
Pollack cleared the way for Drexel to plead guilty to six felonies
and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle
separate criminal charges with the Justice Department.
   ``This settlement will bring to a close 2{ difficult years for

   A handful of nuts a day may keep the heart
attack away, according to a group of California researchers.
   A six-year study of diet and fatal coronary heart disease among
34,000 California members of the Seventh-Day Adventists Church found
that nuts were the only food item listed with a statistically
significant protection against heart attack death.
   ``Compared to a person who never ate nuts, a person who ate them
at least once a day had only 47 percent of the risk'' of fatal heart
attack, said Dr. Gary E. Fraser, co-author of a study presented
Tuesday at the 2nd International Conference of Preventive Cardiology.
   ``Making this even more significant is that a year ago we looked
at non-fatal (heart attacks) and got findings that were extremely
similar,'' said Fraser. ``Nuts seem to reduce the risk of both fatal
and non-fatal heart disease.''

   Along Louisiana's marshy coast, it's always been
hard to tell where the land ends and the water begins. But the line
is changing; about an acre of rich marshland sinks under water every
15 minutes. And the problem isn't confined to Louisiana, as reported
in the first story of a two-part series, ``Disappearing Wetlands.''

   From California to the rocky coast of Maine,
what's left of the nation's wetlands and barrier islands is
disappearing. Nowhere is it going faster than in Louisiana, where 30
to 50 square miles of marshy coastline wash away every year.
   Shrimp fishermen pull trawls over the Port Eads schoolyard where
Clive Duet, 73, used to play. Water 4 feet deep covers the 160-acre
farm near Galliano where Joe Billiot, 51, lived as a child.
   A 200-year-old oak tree stands dying on land near Theriot bought
in 1840 by the great-grandfather of Marvin Marmande Jr. Salt water,
once more than a quarter-mile off, has eaten away the marshes and
now soaks the tree's roots.
   Louisiana, with 40 percent of the nation's remaining coastal
wetlands, suffers 80 percent of the annual loss. Its fragile marshes
are the nurturing grounds for a yearly seafood harvest worth almost
$1 billion, the habitat for 40 percent of the country's fur-bearing
animals and the wintering home for nearly 5 million migratory birds.
   About half of Louisana's marshes have disappeared since World War
II, wiped out by such natural forces as hurricanes and by levees and
dams.
   In Alaska, the nation's worst oil spill has devastated long
stretches of coastline. But the Alaskan wetlands, however damaged,
remain. Eventually, they will renew themselves. The Louisiana
marshes are gone, quietly, without drama, without nightly newscasts,
without crowds of volunteers.
   Robert E. Stewart Jr., director of the National Wetlands Research
Center in Slidell, an arm of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
said: ``People in Europe, when I've had the occasion to speak over
there, have said, `The United States is the most developed, the most
forward-looking, the brightest country in the world. How could you
let this happen?'
   ``The simple truth is that we didn't know, 40 years ago, that it
was going to happen. A lot of the things that started this occurred
40 years ago, and we didn't have the ability to forecast the
effects.''
   Dave Carney, a biologist with the Army Corps of Engineers, said
it was only recently that the Corps began considering the
environment as important as flood control and navigation.
   In addition, Carney said, ``It wasn't until 1969 that the
National Environmental Policy Act ... imposed a system for rigorous
environmental examination of federal projects and activities.
   ``Many decisions were made long before that. Tremendous
investments, the whole Mississippi River tributaries project, all of
the oil and gas exploration and investment that are now regulated,
were not regulated to that degree back in the 1940s and 1950s when
these things started popping.
   ``I'm not saying all of those decisions are irreversible, but
many of them are irreversible _ commitments of resources and
decisions made in Louisiana before the implications were ever
imagined.''
   The scope of the problem is enormous. For one thing, Louisiana's
400-mile-long coast translates to almost 7,000 miles of shore when
the dips, juts and loops of bays, inlets and peninsulas are
included. For another, the Biblical separation of earth and water
never quite took hold in coastal Louisiana, and solid objects tend
to sink in the marshes that merge with the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``I cannot find any coastal marsh loss rate higher than that of
Louisiana anywhere,'' Stewart said. But he also emphasized the
problem was not confined to Louisiana.
   ``The United States has lost about 54 percent of its wetlands
since settlement,'' he said. ``There have also been great losses in
the Dakotas. California has lost 90 percent of its wetlands. ...
   ``You see the same thing in Texas, Mobile Bay, Tampa Bay. Go
around the Florida coast, and you see the same thing. The Florida
Everglades are undergoing tremendous change, largely because of
human impact.
   ``Georgia and the Carolinas? The same sort of thing, but to a
lesser degree. It's really a more stable coastline, so you don't
have the subsidence you have here. ... You have losses in Chesapeake
Bay. The net is a loss in all of those areas.''
   The decisions that affected Louisiana were made with clear logic
and compelling motives but no consideration of long-range harm.
   A strong young nation tamed its biggest river system with dams
and levees, first making it a reliable transportation artery, then
keeping it from overflowing. Nobody pondered how the marshes would
live without replenishment from silt-laden fresh water.
   A vigorous oil industry moved into Louisiana's marshes and the
Gulf of Mexico 50 years ago, dredging canals to get drilling rigs to
the oil and to lay pipe to offshore fields. Nobody considered the
effects of saltwater canals through freshwater marshes.
   And when 27 sets of locks and dams were built on the Mississippi
and the Missouri and a giant irrigation project was built far to the
north in the Dakota Badlands, nobody thought of the Louisiana
marshes.
   ``Each one of these dams is a sediment trap,'' Stewart said.
``They have reduced the sediment substantially. In a free-flowing
system, there was up to 500 million tons a year.''
   It took 700 years for Mississippi River sediment to build the
marshes of the current delta.
   It took 22 years, from 1956 to 1978, for half of those marshes,
more than 1,000 square miles, to disappear.
   ``We took a very dynamic system and made it stable,'' Stewart
said, ``and there were some totally unforeseen consequences.''
   Natural forces were at work, too. Spongy soil compresses under
its own weight. Salt water levels are rising slowly. And hurricanes
can wipe out miles of marshes in a day.
   ``You take one like Betsy in 1965 and it just rolls the marsh up
like a rug,'' Stewart said.
   Hurricanes pile up walls of water in front of them. Those tidal
surges used to dissipate over miles of marshes. Now, they funnel
through canals and navigation channels, spreading salt water miles
inland, killing vegetation and carving up the wetlands.
   Environmentalists blame Big Oil and the Corps of Engineers.
   ``It comes with the territory,'' Carney said of the criticism.
``In a way, the buck does stop here. People can study it, talk about
it, but eventually anything that is going to be done will be done by
the state and the Corps of Engineers in some cooperative way.''
   H. Leighton Steward, chairman, chief executive officer and
president of Louisiana Land and Exploration Co., says the oil
industry has been unfairly targeted.
   LL&amp;E, which owns more than 600,000 acres of marshland, the
largest private holding of coastal wetlands in the United States,
makes most of its money from oil and gas on its land, but also
leases tracts for hunting and trapping.
   Steward estimated that hunting for petroleum in the marshes and
dredging canals to reach oil and gas deposits caused about 10
percent of the loss.
   The remaining 90 percent has been due to natural forces
exacerbated by the trapping of the Mississippi in its current
channel, Steward said.
   ``We don't claim we are absolutely guiltless,'' Steward said,
``because when you build a canal through wetlands, you are going to
chew up a certain amount of wetlands.''

   To Marvin Marmande Jr., the dying oak is a
symbol.
   ``It was a beautiful, full-grown tree when my great-grandfather
first saw it 140 years ago. I remember when I was 7 or 8 years old,
having picnics with my mama and the family here, and the branches
spread way over there,'' Marmande, 31, said, sweeping his arm toward
a point 30 feet away.
   ``Now, it's dying. Its roots are in salt water.''
   The plight of the 200-year-old live oak mirrors what's happening
to all marshland in coastal Louisiana. Erosion and subsidence claim
30-50 square miles of wetland each year.
   ``Our way of life is going with it,'' Marmande said. ``There used
to be 70 families making a living on this land. This was all
farmland, sugar cane and potatoes, mostly, and cattle. ...
   ``This land used to support seven families just for trapping _
muskrat, otter, mink. Now there's just one. We used to catch worlds
of crawfish here, but it's salt water now.''
   The Marmande land is on a finger of high ground built by 700
years of spring floods on the Mississippi River. The fresh water
marshes that surrounded the peninsula were nourished by bayous and
streams running from the river to the Gulf of Mexico.
   The river is trapped by levees now, and the bayous and streams no
longer carry fresh water to the marshes.
   The 8-mile-long Marmande peninsula, about a half-mile wide at its
landward base, ends at a 60-acre plateau that stands a dizzying 7
feet above sea level _ really high ground in these parts.
   ``You can't get there, except by boat,'' Marmande said. ``The
road's under water in a couple of spots _ used to be 3 or 4 feet
above sea level.`'
   Much of the damage has been done by the Houma Navigation Canal, a
straight-shot channel dredged 30 years ago to provide quicker access
to the Gulf of Mexico. Some of the salt water comes up through Cades
Lake and Minors Canal.
   Marmande believes in levees and pumps to isolate the sources of
salt water and hold back erosion.
   ``Look at what they've done in Holland. They've reclaimed land
from the sea,'' he said.
   He points to a neighbor's land where a distinct line shows the
intrusion of salt water _ a vigorous green stand of cypress on one
side of the line, naked brown stumps on the other side.
   ``He built his own levee and put in his own pumps,'' Marmande
said. ``But you can't get permits to do that anymore. We can't even
get permits to raise a levee that's been there 14 years, and it's
sinking.''
   ``I consider it my obligation to try to do something about it.
Maybe we can never put it back the way it was, but we can stop it
from getting worse.''

about 15 years old. He's 34 now, and there's about 5 feet of water
here. We trawl for shrimp all around that piling,'' Authement said.
   The piling is painted red. A red reflector is fixed to its top.
It used to mark the entrance to a narrow channel that Authement and
his brother dug to get their pirogues to the lake.
   ``It was just wide enough to push-pole our pirogues, a
little-bitty canal. Not even a canal, a ditch,'' he said.
   It became a canal about 20 years ago when Terrebonne Parish
widened it to about 10 feet, installed a pumping station and began
using it to drain rain water flooding into Lake Boudreaux.
   The canal is 20-30 feet wide now and getting wider, its banks
crumbling with every storm wind.
   Salt water from the Gulf of Mexico killed groves of tall cypress
trees and old oaks, leaving stark, dead stumps. Salt water also
killed the marsh grass that fed muskrat and nutria.
   A dank salt water bay covers land that was a garden patch when
Authement's son was born.
   ``Who'd have told me 30 years ago that I'd be catching crabs
there some day? I'd have told them they were lying,'' Authement
said. ``The son of a gun stinks, too.''
   Much of the land loss became inevitable 50 years ago when the
Corps of Engineers completed flood control projects on the
Mississippi River. Levees trapped the river, robbing the marshes of
fresh water and silt, and the spongy wetlands began contracting and
sinking beneath the water.
   ``That used to be a big coteau _ real high ground,'' he said,
pointing to an oak stump jutting out of the water, its trunk about 4
feet in diameter. ``I used to shoot squirrels there.''
   Authement and his wife celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary
in April. In the early years of their marriage, they shelled shrimp
for 12{ cents an hour, shucked oysters for 50 cents a gallon, fished
and sold sun-dried shrimp.
   ``It was hard, but it was a good life,'' he said.
   He blames the Houma Navigation Canal for most of the problems.
Dredged to provide straight-line access from Houma shipyards to
oilfields in the Gulf, the canal also gives salt water access to the
marshes.
   ``Forty years for all of this to go from fresh water to salt. I
don't believe we have 30 years left, unless somebody does
something,'' Authement said.

   It took 700 years for the Mississippi River to
build the marshes near its mouth, but half of them have disappeared
in the last 30 years. Is there any way to stop the loss, any way to
restore what's gone? This second segment in a series, ``Disappearing
Wetlands,'' considers what can be done.

   The Mississippi River built Louisiana's
wetlands, and only the Mississippi can restore them.
   Louisiana loses an acre of its productive wetlands every 15
minutes. At that rate, Washington, D.C., would be swallowed up in
about 14 months.
   An estimated 10 percent to 20 percent of Louisiana's loss is due
to exploration, drilling and production of oil and gas in the
marshes and offshore. The main reason for the rest of the loss is
that man, in taming the Mississippi with dams and levees, cut off
the supply of fresh water and silt that kept the wetlands green and
growing.
   Any plans for rebuilding marshes involve getting Mississippi
River water back where it used to flow naturally, but that calls for
big-ticket items. The Army Corps of Engineers is committed to
spending $130 million for just three freshwater diversion projects,
one under construction at Caernarvon, about 15 miles downriver from
New Orleans, the others in final planning stages.
   This is an impoverished state with no money to spare: its
teachers are among the nation's lowest paid, its police and fire
departments are cut back to the bone, its roads are crumbling and
its universities are underfunded. Unemployment is at 11.7 percent.
   The cheaper, less dramatic route would be to save what's left, if
possible, or delay its loss. There are plenty of proposals, from
planting trees to tearing down the levees.
   The U.S. Soil Conservation Service is testing marsh grass and
mangroves to find the toughest strains to help defeat wave action
and tie down fragile soil.
   State and federal agencies are issuing fewer permits for wetlands
activities.
   Some ideas seem too small to have any impact. Bill Good and Vance
Edwards spread discarded Christmas trees in shallow coastal waters.
Henry J. Rodriguez Jr. plants trees on marshland hummocks. Roland
Thomas sets out sprigs of marsh grass. Piles of old Christmas trees
might trap sediment and slow erosion, restoring and protecting the
marsh. Roots from new vegetation might also hold sediment.
   ``Usually, thinking big is the way to go, but we may have to
think small on this problem,'' said Dave Carney of the Army Corps of
Engineers, the first biologist to be named manager of a wetlands
restoration project by the Corps.
   Louisiana Land and Exploration Co. thinks small in a big way _
400 water-control weirs on the 600,000-plus acres it owns in the
coastal marshes. The land, the largest private holding of coastal
wetlands in the country, is dotted with LL&amp;E's oil wells.
   Starting in 1956, long before the plight of the wetlands was
obvious, LL&amp;E began building weirs across inlets and bayous that ebb
and flow with the tides. The low dams, their tops below water level,
are designed to break the force of waves on their way in and slow
their retreat until they have dropped their load of sediment.
   The weirs' effects have never been scientifically measured, but
comparisons with unprotected marshes show they work, asserts H.
Leighton Steward, chief executive officer and president of LL&amp;E.
   ``If there are two little natural channels going back into the
marsh, both about 30 feet wide, and you put a little weir on one and
not on the other, we can see that after a time, one is still 30 feet
wide, and the other has eroded on back into the marshes,'' Steward
said.
   ``We have areas where we have the weirs in place, and another
land owner, maybe a mile over, has never had them, and our guys can
demonstrate that our land is in better shape than theirs is,'' he
said.
   Dag Nummendal of Louisiana State University's geology department
believes such efforts are a losing fight, and the focus should be on
cutting losses, rather than spending billions of dollars trying to
win.
   He advocates a retreat from everything south of Highway 90, the
old east-west route along a natural ridge from New Orleans, down
through Morgan City, then up to Lafayette and westward to Lake
Charles.
   The Louisiana Geological Survey estimates Highway 90 will be an
oceanfront road by 2083, if nothing is done to reverse coastal
erosion.
   Nummendal recommends a rear-guard action of weirs, pumps and dams
_ anything to slow the creeping sea _ while the residents of three
dozen coastal communities head for higher ground over the next 50
years.
   ``That's ludicrous. That's too ridiculous even to consider,''
said Marvin Marmande Jr., a Houma businessman and farmer. To leave
would mean abandoning land his French-born great-grandfather bought
in 1840. ``I would be abandoning everything my father, my
grandfather and my great-grandfather worked for, if I left.''
   Carney and his fellow project manager at the Corps of Engineers,
Jay Warren, say rudimentary studies have looked at turning the river
loose below New Orleans.
   One proposal involved dredging a new navigation channel to
connect with the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Canal, tearing down
levees and taking ship traffic out of the Mississippi.
   ``Essentially, (it would) abandon navigation in the Mississippi
River channel, let the channel silt up to whatever depth it wanted
to _ about 17 feet _ and put a lock in the river,'' Warren said.
   The Gulf Outlet Canal is an underused backdoor path from the Gulf
of Mexico to New Orleans, deemed an economic godsend when it was
dredged through the marshes 30 years ago. A major source of flooding
in Hurricane Betsy in 1965, it introduced salt water into previously
fresh marshes in St. Bernard Parish, helping to accelerate the death
of miles of cypress swamps.
   Manny Fernandez, spokesman for Gov. Buddy Roemer on environmental
matters, said letting the Mississippi go wild below New Orleans was
not realistic.
   ``There are tremendous downsides to that,'' Fernandez said. ``No.
1 is the cost. No. 2 is that you're going through a tremendous
amount of wetlands doing that excavation of a new channel.
   ``Growing up in St. Bernard Parish and seeing the tremendous loss
and devastation from the Gulf Outlet, I don't believe we ought to be
looking at dredging another channel to solve environmental
problems.''
   Carney favors building big sluices to let controlled amounts of
river water flow through the levees and dump replenishing sediment
through the marshes. The freshwater diversion project at Caernarvon,
when completed in two years, will dump 8,000 cubic feet of water
into the marshes each second.
   Fernandez said he and the head of the state Department of
Environmental Quality, Paul Templet, believe freshwater and sediment
diversion structures hold the answer to restoring the marshes.
   ``Paul Templet has said we may need as many as 20 of these
structures, rather than the one being built and the two or three
being contemplated,'' Fernandez said. ``It will take that many to
get the silt back in the marshes.''

   Chains of islands are strung like beads along
America's coasts _ a barrier that absorbs the force of storms and
shields the mainland.
   But the islands are disappearing. At least 50 barrier islands off
Louisiana have washed away over 30 years, exposing delicate marshes
and wetlands to direct assault by the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``Barrier islands are like your skin, the first line of defense
against infection,'' said Robert E. Stewart Jr., director of the
National Wetlands Research Center, a branch of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
   However, he said, ``It would be enormously expensive to restore
them.''
   ``Something can be done, but it would be very, very expensive,''
echoed Jay Warren, a project engineer with the Army Corps of
Engineers. ``Not only would you have to restore them, but then you
have to maintain them.
   ``We had a study just last year that looked at barrier island
maintenance as a way to protect marsh behind the barrier islands and
also as a means to reduce storm surge and hurricane damage inland.
Even picking up those benefits, the cost was just prohibitive.''
   Almost 2,700 miles of barrier islands protect the coasts of 18
states along the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, and all of the
islands are threatened. The West Coast has fewer barrier islands,
but they are also eroding and drifting inland.
   Fire Island, a sliver of sand and expensive cottages just east of
New York's Long Island, is losing beaches on both the seaward and
landward sides despite groins and jetties built to save them. A
million cubic yards of sand shift along the coasts of both Cape
Hatteras and Cape Cod each year.
   Texas' Galveston Island has been protected by seawalls since a
hurricane killed 6,000 people in 1900. But its beach eroded after
the wall was built _ the sort of tradeoff made wherever man has
moved onto the islands.
   Seawalls, jetties, groins and rocks all produce the same result:
they direct wave action elsewhere, and the beaches wash away.
   Andy Valence is mayor of Grand Isle, Louisiana's only developed
barrier island. A 2,000-foot section of its beach is under a state
of emergency as Gulf waters lap at a motel's pilings and close in on
state Highway 1, the only route onto the island. Valence wants to
build protective rock jetties and estimates the project will cost
about $422,000.
   Robert Jones, parish engineer and civil defense director for
nearby Terrebonne Parish, predicted the project would cost 10 times
that much and would fail unless the rocks were given a sound
foundation and provisions were made to get fresh sand to the beach.
   ``Unless it's done right, those rocks are just going to eat
themselves into the sand and disappear,'' he said.
   Jones has earned his air of authority. Five years ago, he defied
conventional advice and saved the eastern tip of Isle Derniere,
where pounding waves were threatening to cut off two-thirds of a
mile.
   Isle Derniere, French for Last Island, is the largest of
Louisiana's barrier islands at 1,800 acres. Jones' repairs have
withstood eight hurricanes, absorbing the force of tidal surges that
otherwise would have hit coastal communities unchecked.
   Jones used all natural materials. Near the area being washed over
by waves, he found deposits of especially coarse sand. His crews
scooped that sand into a protective dune that topped out at 8 feet
above sea level, then filled the holes with the finer sand off the
Gulf floor.
   Next he hired students to plant seagrass to anchor the sand.
``The key to keeping what you've got pumped up on the island is
vegetation,'' he said.
   ``In the first year of its existence, it faced three hurricane
surges, and it was completely overtopped by Hurricane Juan,'' Jones
said. ``We had a number of hurricanes every year since then.
   ``Hurricane Gilbert (last fall,) even though it hit 500 miles
away, sent a storm surge here that overtopped every levee in
southern Terrebonne Parish. ... The vegetation held up fine.''
   Jones said the best way to save the barrier islands would be to
put $10 million in trust for 10 islands, then use the interest each
year to restore one. ``At the end of 10 years, you'd go back and
start over again,'' he said.
   ``You can't think of it as a one-shot civil engineering problem.
That was my major problem to begin with,'' Jones said. ``I'm used to
putting something up in concrete and five years later having it look
the same way.
   ``The first time I went out there after a hurricane, I was very
disappointed. The geologists were ecstatic that it survived as well
as it did.''

   Pete Kowanko plays the latest in a long line
of television heroes on the run in his role as the title character
in the NBC Sunday movie ``The Gifted One.''
   Kowanko plays Michael Grant, a man of special mystical powers,
pursued by Dr. Boardman (John Rhys-Davies), an opportunistic
scientist who can hardly wait to experiment on Grant to see what
makes him tick.
   ``Michael Grant's mind uses the full potential that man's capable
of,'' said Kowanko. ``He's gifted. He can direct the electrical
power of his body like a laser to heal. He can place himself in
synch with any living thing or lock into someone else's subconscious.
   ``That gift can also be painful. He has an acute sense of right
and wrong. He doesn't want to take advantage of it in a dark way.
Nor does he want to be exploited by the military or anyone else.''
   The ``chase'' story is a favorite television premise. The most
popular was ``The Fugitive,'' which ran on ABC in 1963-67 and
starred David Janssen as a man wrongly accused of killing his wife
and was pursued by law enforcement authorities while searching for
her killer.
   In ``The Immortal,'' on ABC during 1970-71, the lead character
was a man immune to disease who was on the run because a ruthless
billionaire wanted his special antibodies. The short-lived ``Hot
Pursuit'' on NBC in 1984 focused on a young couple fleeing a false
charge of murder, and a space alien and his son were chased by
government scientists in ABC's ``Starman'' in 1986-87.
   The form even inspired a CBS sitcom parody in 1966-67, ``Run
Buddy Run,'' in which a hapless man was on the run from gangsters.
   In ``The Gifted One,'' as in ``The Fugitive,'' the hero is on a
quest of his own while being pursued. He's looking for his real
mother after learning he is not the son of the couple who raised
him; he's running from the people who want to exploit his powers.
   ``The Gifted One'' is not as mystical as ``Kung Fu,'' about a
Eurasian monk wandering the Old West while being pursued by agents
of the Chinese imperial family and American bounty hunters. But,
like ``Kung Fu,'' ``The Gifted One'' features flashbacks to the
hero's childhood.
   The movie was to have been the pilot for a possible series, but
the show is not on NBC's fall schedule.
   ``I thought we'd get picked up for a series right away,'' Kowanko
said. ``I still think we have a chance for a backup order. I think
it's a good alternative. It's not a cop show. It's a fantasy. He has
powers but he's not a super human being. He's not a space alien.''
   Kowanko's own background sounds like the concept for a series
about a man on the move.
   He was born in Australia but was raised in California and
Minnesota after his parents divorced. He returned to Australia at 15
to mine sapphires with his stepfather. He worked in construction,
was a deck hand on a Mississippi River towboat, waited tables and
was a ski bum in Colorado when he was ``discovered'' and asked to
audition for a commercial.
   ``I was an adventurous soul,'' he said. ``I worked on the
Mississippi River during my Huck Finn fantasy. I worked from St.
Paul, Minn., to Ste. Genevieve, Mo., all 27 locks and dams, pushing
15 barges. My job as deck hand was to take the barges apart because
only half could go through the locks at a time.''
   He went to New York in 1980 and was signed to a development deal
by ABC. Later, he was in the NBC series ``For Love and Honor.'' He
played Willie Wolf in the movie ``Patty,'' about the kidnaping of
Patricia Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army.
   In the last five years he has moved back and forth between here
and Australia, where he and his mother own a fruit farm and vineyard
in the Outback along the Tropic of Capricorn.

<HEAD>Tide Against Marijuana And Free Sex, But For Work And Angels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are turning against marijuana and
greater sexual freedom. Large majorities of them also favor stronger
family ties, more emphasis on hard work and less on money.
   They especially trust organized religion, and two-thirds are
members of a church or synagogue. But half think religion is losing
influence on American life, while a third think it's increasing.
   Most think a person can be a good Christian or Jew without
attending religious services, but 42 percent do so each week. A
third say they have experienced a powerful religious insight or
awakening.
   And most teen-agers affirm belief in angels.
   These are among the varied facets of faith turned up in recent
Gallup organization polls, and summarized by its Princeton Religious
Research Center in its monthly Emerging Trends.
   Most of the surveys were among a representative 1,200 or more,
with a margin for error of less than 4 percent either way.
   One of the most unusual and consistent findings in this age of
technocracy is that one of every three Americans say they have had a
``mystical experience, that is a momemt of sudden religious insight
or awakening.''
   The center says this ``is one of the least explored, yet one of
the most fascinating aspects of the spiritual life of Americans,
sometimes described as an other-worldy feeling or union with God or
a universal spirit.''
   The Gallup poll first began exploring the topic in 1962, finding
that 20 percent then reported such experiences. By 1976, the
proportion had risen to 31 percent, and has ranged above that since,
33 percent in 1988.
   ``Such an experience often appears to have a profound effect on
the outlook and direction of a person's life,'' the report says,
adding that the experiences are ``more often gradual than sudden.
   ``One of the most interesting aspects of these phenomena is that
they happen to the non-churched and the non-religious as well as to
persons ... who say religion plays an important role in their
lives.''
   On the drugs and sex issues, the trend is definitely down. During
the past 10 years, public acceptance of marijuana has plunged _ from
20 percent in 1978 to 13 percent in 1981 to only 8 percent today.
   In the same period, overall public demand for greater sexual
freedom fell from 29 percent in 1978 to 25 percent in 1981 to 22
percent today, with the sharpest downturn among young adults,
although they still are more likely to espouse it.
   Support for stronger family ties, now 94 percent, has remained
close to that throughout the decade. So has the support for less
emphasis on money, now 67 percent, and for working hard, now 70
percent.
   Organized religion has for years been rated the most trusted
institution, although the military momentarily surpassed it in 1986,
and still ranks close to it.
   The Supreme Court is close behind, with television, organized
labor and big business at the bottom of the list.
   The 65 percent reporting church or synagogue membership is the
lowest ever recorded, down from 69 percent the year before. The
record high was 76 percent in 1947. Attendance, now 42 percent, hit
its high in 1955 at 49 percent.
   Seventy-six percent of Americans say one can be a good Christian
or Jew and not attend religious services, a proportion that has
changed little for the last three decades.
   Among U.S. college students, about half of those who have heard
of the ``New Age movement'' have an unfavorable view of it, and only
14 percent favorable. It is a modern, optimistic mix of Eastern and
Western spiritual ideas.
   More teens than ever believe in angels, 74 percent of them, up
from 64 percent in 1978. At the same time, 29 percent of them say
they believe in witchcraft, up slightly from 25 percent in 1978.
   While a majority of teen-agers, more than 70 percent, approve of
interfaith marriages, the proportion has dropped slightly since
1977. But approval of interracial marragies has jumped from 52
percent in 1977 to 65 percent now.
   Concerning church switchers, the biggest mobility seems to be
among Methodists. Only a third raised as Methodists still identify
with that church. A tenth raised as Roman Catholic no longer claim
it.
   The findings indicated more stability among other denominations,
with Baptists losing some and Presbyterians gaining some, and most
other mainline denominations mostly holding their own.

<HEAD>The Biggest Bailout Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One day this summer, the government is going to
create a giant corporation that will become the biggest business in
history _ and the smart money men are watching closely. Too closely
for comfort, according to some of the people involved in the savings
and loan bailout.
   The new organization will be called the Resolution Trust Corp.,
created to handle liquidation of fallen savings and loans and the
sale of shaky ones under the bill now inching toward congressional
approval.
   ``There are people out there waiting to pick the Resolution Trust
Corp.'s pocket before it has its pants on,'' said Rep. Elizabeth J.
Patterson, D-S.C.
   They will be very deep pockets.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Tex., chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said the RTC will be responsible for handling more than
$400 billion in real estate and other assets of insolvent savings
and loans.
   Under the bailout bill that is to be put into its final shape
over the next month or so by House and Senate negotiators, it will
have a high-profile board of overseers, including Secretary of the
Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and
Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board. Brady is to
appoint a chief executive to run the RTC.
   ``Asking three of the busiest individuals in government to
oversee the disposition of hundreds of billions of dollars in real
estate and other assets is foolish,'' said Sen. John F. Kerry,
D-Mass., who wanted a bigger and, in his view, stronger supervisory
board. ``The potential for scandal is tremendous.''
   The bill provides that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will
take over the insurance role of the bankrupt savings and loan
insurance fund and will assume control of insolvent S&amp;Ls. The
Resolution Trust Corp. will be responsible for selling off assets to
liquidate them, with proceeds to help pay for the bailout.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, said liquidating and
selling S&amp;Ls ``is going to be a very unpleasant task,'' costing
jobs, money and guaranteeing lawsuits.
   ``There will be more opportunity for mischief than I would like
to see,'' Seidman said.
   Neither version of the S&amp;L bill spells out roles very clearly;
Seidman said he assumes his FDIC will play a part in the liquidation
operation. It has some experience in the field after selling off $9
billion in assets of failed commercial banks.
   Kerry said those sales led to 21,000 claims and lawsuits _ on
transactions that will be dwarfed by RTC operations.
   The numbers point to the challenge of finding lawyers,
accountants and appraisers who know the field and are not already
tied up in S&amp;L cases. Hiring a boss will present the same problem _
Kerry said it will have to be ``an individual of unquestioned
integrity ... with extensive business experience who does not hold a
position that would present a conflict of interest.''
   While there is no real blueprint for the operation _ ``who does
what is far from clear,'' Seidman said _ Congress has set some
guidelines.
   The Senate bill forbids real estate sales at bargain basement
prices, to avoid undercutting markets that already are weak. But the
RTC is supposed to dispose of assets as quickly as possible at the
best price it can get. And holding property off the market would
create uncertainty that could be just as bad for depressed real
estate prices. The House added a requirement that low-income housing
groups get first refusal on the sale of residential property.
   As the House-Senate conference on the savings and loan bill
begins work, some members still are worried about the corporation
they are creating.
   ``Many of us believe that the Resolution Trust Corp. is the
Achilles' heel of this bill,'' Rep. Patterson said.
   Congressional qualms are heightened by the industry talk about
the bonanza ahead, ``potentially a diamond mine of opportunity''
according to Nation's Building News.
   ``The name of the RTC game will be sales at discounts,'' that
publication said in its June 5 edition, cited by Kerry in the
Senate. ``For savvy buyers, RTC's regional and local offerings could
provide years of tempting deals. And profits.''
   The National Thrift &amp; Mortgage News advertised an even more
specialized newsletter, Resolution Trust Reporter, to begin
publication on Sept. 11, reporting on RTC operations it said will
affect every real estate market, developer, appraiser and lender in
the country.
   ``Who is going to cash in when the Resolution Trust Corp. opens
its doors?'' that publication asked. ``How about you?''

<HEAD>A Handle on Dependent-Care Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American employers in increasing numbers are
offering workers a tax-saving arrangement called a ``dependent care
reimbursement account.''
   For two-income couples and single parents, this program serves
much the same function as the traditional tax credit available to
workers who have dependent-care expenses necessary for them to do
their jobs.
   But the reimbursement account differs in several important ways
from the tax credit. If you have a choice between the two (you can't
pick both), financial advisers say you might well come out ahead
with the reimbursement account.
   In a typical case, reimbursement accounts are offered to
employees with children up to the age of 13, or with older
stay-at-home dependents who need care.
   Employees who enroll in the plan figure their expected costs for
each year, and then request that a proportionate sum be withheld
from their regular paychecks. The money withheld is subtracted from
their taxable income.
   After you pay your dependent-care expenses, you submit copies of
your bills or canceled checks to your employer, who then reimburses
you from the money in your account.
   If this strikes you as a bit unwieldy, you're by no means alone.
   You might be put off further by the warning that you need to
figure your contributions to the account carefully. The rules state
that any unused money in your account at yearend can't be reclaimed.
It's gone.
   So why go to all the trouble? Why not just save up your canceled
checks and take a dependent-care tax credit each year?
   Well, because it might save you some money, says the accounting
firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand: ``For almost everyone, the reimbursement
account will be the better choice.''
   With such an account, people in the upper tax brackets can save
28 percent or 33 percent on each dependent-care dollar up to $5,000
a year, the firm points out.
   That compares with a 20 percent tax credit for upper-income
workers on a maximum of $2,400 for one dependent or $4,800 for two
or more.
   Furthermore, you don't pay Social Security tax (at a rate of 7.51
percent) on the money that goes into your reimbursement account. The
child-care credit has no effect on your Social Security tax.
   In lower income brackets, the child-care credit offers a savings
of up to 30 percent. However, says Coopers &amp; Lybrand, ``most lower
income people will find this is more than offset by the reduced
Social Security and income taxes and, possibly, by a higher earned
income credit.''
   All in all, not bad: More options for many people in an era when
tax breaks are disappearing fast.
   But there's a catch. It is very likely that fewer people _ much
fewer, one might speculate _ will take advantage of any writeoffs
for dependent care in 1989 than have done so in years past.
   Starting this year, whether you use a reimbursement plan or claim
a dependent-care credit, you must specify the Social Security number
or taxpayer identification number of the ``care provider.''
   This gives the IRS a means of checking whether all the money
claimed as child-care expenses is reported as taxable income by the
person or organization receiving the payments.
   It also defines more clearly cases where you are legally required
to pay such things as Social Security tax and unemployment insurance
for anyone who earns $50 or more working in your home in any
calendar quarter.
   That pretty well puts all dependent-care tax breaks out of reach
for anybody who doesn't play the game strictly by the book.

<HEAD>After Three Months, Blot of Oil Still Spreads Across Alaska Coastline</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   Three months have passed, and the sea still
coughs up dead birds with every change of the tide.
   Three months have passed, and an army of workers 9,000 strong has
yet to completely clean even one heavily oiled beach.
   Three months have passed, and the biggest oil spill in U.S.
history gets bigger every day, spreading its slime farther across
Alaska's wild southern coast, pushing its poison deeper and higher
along the food chain.
   ``We keep hoping for some kind of closure, some sign that this is
all the damage we have and we can deal with it,'' says Anne
Castellina, superintendent of Kenai Fjords National Park. ``But we
can't. The oil disappears one day when the waves clean a beach, only
to wash up on another beach the next day.''
   Prince William Sound's bountiful waters and mountainous islands
were the first to be fouled after the tanker Exxon Valdez rammed a
reef March 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons of North Slope
crude oil.
   But the damage didn't stop there. Streamers of oil and tar balls
leaked out between the sound's barrier islands and were pushed by
Gulf of Alaska currents to beaches 450 miles away.
   Oil now has tainted more than 700 miles of shoreline, from the
glacier-carved cliffs of Kenai Fjords to the clamoring bird
rookeries of Katmai National Park, from lonely Cook Inlet beaches to
the mouths of Kodiak Island salmon streams.
   Cleanup workers have found the oil-soaked bodies of about 26,000
sea birds, 784 sea otters and 57 bald eagles. The spreading oil has
other victims. Fishermen and other coastal residents who make their
living from the ocean cringe each week at news of more beaches
polluted and more fishing grounds closed.
   The wreck of the Exxon Valdez created an environmental
catastrophe that unfolds in one little tragedy after another:
   _A wildlife official filming damage on a beach sets a video
cassette down on a black rock, and the rock crawls away. It turns
out to be an oil-smeared duck.
   _A burly fisherman breaks into tears as he describes steering his
boat through the slick: no water lapping, no birds crying, just the
sickening silence of oil slipping past the hull.
   _At a bird rescue center in Seward, some of the patients are
failing. They have been washed clean, but not before swallowing
fatal doses of oil. They don't cry out; instinct tells them not to
advertise their distress to predators. ``They just get real quiet,
sit in a corner and die,'' says rescue coordinator Jay Holcomb.
   Like a candy bar in the hands of a 2-year-old, crude oil from the
Exxon Valdez has gotten onto everything.
   Rainbow sheens on the water stream from suffocating mats of black
goop on beaches. Wind and waves whip oil into a sticky froth that
workers call ``chocolate mousse.'' Tar balls bob in the surf,
washing ashore to melt in the sun and sink into the sand. Oil
splatters driftwood logs high above the tide line and sinks as much
as 3 feet into gravel beaches. Undulating blobs of oil hang below
the water's surface, ready to foul fishermen's nets.
   At first, Exxon boldly promised to clean it all up.
   ``We're going to pick up _ one way or the other _ all the oil
that's out there,'' Exxon spokesman Don Cornett told reporters one
week after the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
   The promise didn't keep for long.
   Exxon was too slow and the spill was too big for booms to contain
the oil immediately after the accident. And the company missed its
chance during the first few days to burn off large quantities of oil
or disperse it with chemicals. Some oil was skimmed up, but for the
most part Exxon had to wait for oil to wash up on shore, where the
goo could be scraped, wiped or flushed painstakingly from rocks and
gravel.
   By May 1, the clean-it-all promise had been modified. Exxon
proposed to clean 364 miles of coastline by mid-September, noting
that it might have to leave 191 additional miles of lightly oiled
shore to be washed by nature.
   The Coast Guard approved Exxon's plan, but even the limited
cleanup may prove beyond the company's capability, despite an
investment of more than $200 million to date.
   The cleanup effort now includes more than 9,000 workers, 800
boats, 45 oil skimmers, and 60 airplanes and helicopters. Hundreds
of workers clad in rain slickers and hard hats crowd into coves that
in most years might see a few fishermen or recreational boaters, if
anyone at all.
   Barges nose up to shore, carrying generators and boilers to heat
the water sprayed from hoses on the beach. Skimmers just offshore
pick up oil as it flushes off the beach, while yet more vessels tend
containment booms to keep the washed-off oil from spreading.
   Where there isn't enough machinery, workers hit the beaches with
shovels, absorbent pads and plastic bags, scooping and scraping and
wiping by hand.
   ``It has become pretty labor-intensive,'' says Exxon spokesman
Amos Plante.
   The Coast Guard, which is overseeing Exxon's cleanup effort, has
``signed off'' on about 50 miles of shoreline along Prince William
Sound. But that doesn't mean a beach is clean _ it just means Exxon
can move on. Even the most intensive scrubbing cannot touch oil
imbedded deep within a beach.
   The word ``clean'' is now taboo on official forms used to track
Exxon's efforts. Workers don't clean beaches anymore. They ``treat''
them.
   The difference is more than semantics, as a visit to a Prince
William Sound beach with a state environmental official shows.
``This,'' says Steve Provant as he kicks an oily rock, ``is a
treated beach.''
   Provant, the on-scene cleanup coordinator for the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation, is standing on a Green
Island beach known to officials as GR-1A. The Coast Guard signed off
on this beach May 29, declaring that Exxon crews had ``completed
removal of gross contamination.'' Provant saw it back then, and it
looked pretty good, he says.
   But now the oil is back. Globs of mousse litter the cobbled
beach. Rainwater beads up on the rocks as it would on the waxed hood
of a car. Provant digs into the sand, and his hand comes up greasy
brown.
   ``If you dig, you find oil down quite a ways,'' Provant says.
``You can see how much oil has been washed back in or has percolated
up from below. We're really not through with this beach.''
   Provant's agency hounds Exxon, suggesting ways the cleanup could
run more efficiently. Exxon, state and federal officials spend hours
each day arguing over how deeply to clean particular beaches, or
whether cleaning them will do more harm than good.
   ``Everybody wants a clean beach, us included,'' says Exxon's
Plante. ``The definition of clean is subject to interpretation. What
we're obviously going to do is work as hard to do the best job we
can. We may have some disagreements over whether it's sufficiently
clean.''

   While the arguments rage onshore, the death toll mounts at sea.
   Stymied by vast distances and stormy weather, bird rescuers have
been able to capture, clean and release only about 500 sea birds.
For every surviving bird, more than 50 dead ones lie in freezer vans
_ more than 26,000 in all. And that's just a fraction of total
mortality. Some biologists say that for every dead bird collected,
perhaps 100 have died unnoticed.
   Sea otters appear to be the hardest-hit marine mammal. The 784
dead sea otters collected so far represent about one-tenth of Prince
William Sound's total population. Harbor seals may be suffering,
too, but few carcasses have been found. ``Dead seals sink like lead
balloons,'' explains state marine biologist Kathy Frost.
   The oil's lethal reach extends down the food chain. On some
beaches, mats of oil have wiped out all life, suffocating intertidal
creatures such as limpets, mussels, crabs and starfish.
   And the oil reaches upward, to the tops of tall shoreside spruce
trees where bald eagles roost. Oiled sea birds have become a fatal
attraction for scavenging eagles, killing 57 of the birds of prey.
Biologists have collected lifeless eggs from 30 abandoned eagle
nests in the spill area.
   Hungry brown bears on the shores of Katmai National Park have
feasted on oily bird carcasses until they could eat no more, digging
holes in the sand to cache the leftovers.
   Bears are hardy creatures, but biologists have radio-collared 30
of them to study their reaction to swallowing so much oil. ``We
haven't determined what effect it has on them. But I can imagine
what it would do to me,'' says Katmai National Park Superintendent
Ray Bane.
   At the very top of the food chain are the humans who live close
to nature in coastal villages. When Aleut natives complained that
the oil spill kept them from gathering food through fishing and
seal-hunting, Exxon flew in cases of beef, chicken and diced ham. It
gave the villagers stomachaches.
   Many commercial fishermen have been idled by the spill, though
some have landed jobs with Exxon, leasing their boats at rates of
$3,400 a day and more.
   Most of the salmon and halibut swimming beneath the oil appear to
be surviving. But fisheries worth more than $110 million have been
canceled or postponed by Alaska officials worried that surface oil
might taint fish as they are hauled from the water in fishermen's
nets.
   As spring turns to summer, even Exxon officials are starting to
waver on the question of finishing the cleanup by mid-September, a
deadline long dismissed as unrealistic by some state and federal
officials.
   ``It's always a hope,'' says Exxon's Plante. ``But it's tougher
to predict whether we'll do it by then. That's our plan. We've
always said we will not leave it uncleaned, and if that means coming
back, so be it.''
   The sooner the better for all concerned _ particularly for 120
frisky sea otters now swimming restlessly in floating pens. They've
beaten the odds, thanks to rescuers at an otter hospital in Seward.
The animals are clean, healthy and ready to return to the wild.
   But they must stay put, biologists say, because the wild is not
ready for them.

   The rhetoric surrounding the nation's
worst oil spill sometimes has grown as muddled as the North Slope
crude fouling Alaska's southern coast.
   Just how bad is the spill? How is the cleanup going? Here's a
look at three months of changing pronouncements, promises and
predictions offered by Exxon and other officials.
   _MARCH 24. The Exxon Valdez rams a reef, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of oil.
   _MARCH 25. State environmental officials call the initial
response by Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. ``inadequate and
unacceptable.'' Alyeska spokesman Chuck O'Donnel says, ``I think our
people did an excellent job.'' The slick covers 28 square miles.
   _MARCH 30. ``We're going to pick up _ one way or the other _ all
the oil that's out there,'' Exxon spokesman Don Cornett tells
reporters in Valdez.
   _MARCH 31. The slick now covers 600 square miles. ``Absolutely
not, it has not gotten away from us,'' Cornett says. ``We are making
good progress on this cleanup.''
   _APRIL 18. Oil has killed at least 1,850 birds and 328 sea
otters. The slick has spread over 3,000 square miles. Exxon Chairman
L.G. Rawl says he's confident most beaches will be clean by
mid-September.
   ``Now I'm not going to tell you that if you go up there a year
from now you won't find some black places on some rocks, but we're
going to make every effort to get it off,'' Rawl says.
   _MAY 2. In Alaska, Exxon officials say they now plan to leave
nearly 200 miles of oiled coastline to be cleaned by nature. In
Houston, Exxon President William D. Stevens says, ``I believe we in
Exxon have shown our commitment and our determination to deal
responsibly with the spill and all its effects.''
   Oil shows up in Katmai National Park, 300 miles from where the
tanker grounded.
   _MAY 5. Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker says cleanup is ``progressing
on schedule.'' Oil is sighted 450 miles from where the tanker
grounded.
   _MAY 9. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins says Exxon is as
concerned with public relations as with cleaning up oil. ``They have
sent PR people into the field instead of operators,'' he says.
   _MAY 10. Exxon President Stevens tells a congressional committee
the company ``fully expects to clean up'' by mid-September. The
wildlife death toll climbs to 9,900 birds and 613 sea otters.
   _MAY 24. ``I don't think that we would portray to you that we're
going to take every stain out of all the rocks that are out there,''
says Exxon official Otto Harrison in Valdez. ``Nor do I want to
portray to you that I think that's necessary to be environmentally
clean.''
   _JUNE 1. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost says he sees
progress but predicts that Exxon almost certainly will miss its
mid-September deadline. ``I think there was too much optimism,'' he
says. ``I think reality has set in.''
   _JUNE 14. Exxon officials hedge on their September deadline.
``It's always a hope,'' says Exxon spokesman Amos Plante in Seward.
``But it's tougher to predict whether we'll do it by then. That's
our plan. We've always said we will not leave it uncleaned, and if
that means coming back, so be it.''

<TEXT>
   Alaska's sense of betrayal by Big Oil is
leading to stronger regulation of the state's most profitable
industry in the long wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   It was 12 years ago this week that oil began flowing through the
800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline. Since then, the state has used its
oil wealth to build roads and schools, boost its economy and keep
its taxes low.
   But in the 12 weeks since the spill fouled Prince William Sound,
Alaskans have expressed anger over the industry's broken promise
that it could protect the environment from such a disaster.
   ``Now that we've seen the down side we're going to be much more
cautious about our relationship with the industry,'' said state
Senate President Tim Kelly, a longtime industry supporter.
   ``The message I get from my constituents is the state's going to
have to be more vigilant in its own regulation of the industry, and
we can't depend on the industry or other government entities to do
that for us,'' Kelly said.
   State legislators last month passed an initial package of bills
aimed at preventing future spills and narrowly approved a measure to
cut an oil-industry tax break. The change will cost the oil
companies operating on Alaska's North Slope an estimated $2 billion
over the next 20 years.
   Bill Webb, head of an Anchorage-based group that represents
oil-support businesses, is one of the few industry officials who has
spoken publicly against what they see as political overreaction.
   ``I guess I'm shocked, confused and extremely concerned about
where the state's relationship with its biggest industry is and
where it's heading,'' Webb said last week. ``This is the worst I've
ever seen it.''
   The tax changes and additional restrictions on the industry sent
an anti-development message about Alaska to the Lower 48, Webb
asserted.
   ``I've never seen any state that's turned and tried to do damage
to their industry like Alaska has tried to do now,'' Webb said.
``Can you imagine Michigan trying to do to the auto industry what
we're trying to do to oil?''
   Kelly said he has seen no signs that Alaska's pro-development
image has been tarnished by its recent actions against Big Oil.
   ``They're not happy, but I think that we're playing under a
different set of rules,'' he said. ``As the new rules are understood
and stability again returns to the Alaska economy, I think they're
going to work out.
   ``There may be some short-range exploration and production
losses, but in the long range the fact remains that the industry has
to go where the oil is. The oil doesn't go to them.''
   Republican Kelly voted to maintain the oil tax break, but he has
helped lead the post-spill campaign for more regulation.
   He and other legislators acknowledge that industry, state and
federal officials became complacent about the risks involved in
transporting oil across Alaska.
   ``I think after a decade of no serious and major accidents, that
we assumed that was the norm,'' the Anchorage lawmaker said. ``There
was a tendency of urban-area legislators to accept at face value
what the industry told us, because a lot of us felt what was good
for the oil industry was good for Alaska.''
   Money helped lawmakers forget the state's watchdog role, said
Sen. Pat Pourchot, an Anchorage Democrat.
   ``When everybody's making money and everybody's feeling good
about the economy, it's natural to think of yourself in partnership
with the industry. You're making money, they're making money _ it's
sort of a `we' kind of thing,'' Pourchot said.
   Many recall 1981 as a watershed year for the Legislature, a year
in which oil and development concerns began to outweigh
environmental concerns. The Republican-led Senate especially became
dominated by industry defenders.
   The Legislature, like the state, was infused with new Alaskans,
many of whom had benefitted financially from the oil boom and wanted
to see it last, Pourchot said.
   ``The whole view of boom, boom, boom and growth sort of swept the
state at that point,'' he said.
   In 1981 the Legislature restructured the way state oil taxes are
calculated and passed the tax break that remained untouched until
this year. Proponents of the changes said the cost to the state
would be negligible.
   ``In fact, it was a billion-dollar-plus loss to the state'' after
just five years, said Rep. Sam Cotten, speaker of the Democratic-led
House.
   Although Alaska has spent and saved billions of oil dollars, some
argue that its primary failure in the past decade was not getting
more money from its oil to secure the state's future when the
pipeline runs dry.
   Sen. Jay Kerttula, a Democrat who has served in the Legislature
since 1960, said lawmakers lost sight of their role as stewards of
the oil for future generations.
   ``The wrinkles were out of the bellies of Alaskans, they were
sitting there watching TV and not paying attention to their public
ownership responsibilities,'' he said. ``We weren't paying attention
to the bottom line.''
   Throughout the past decade, development-oriented legislators
opposed increased funding for the Department of Environmental
Conservation. At times the agency was given additional
responsibilities without additional funding.
   When Commissioner Dennis Kelso took over the department two years
ago, its employees were working a four-day week because of budget
cuts. He estimated then that the agency was $10 million short of the
budget it needed to meet the minimum requirements of state and
federal laws.
   But Kelso insists the cuts did not create the conditions that led
to the Valdez spill and the slow cleanup. He blames Exxon and
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium of oil companies that
runs the pipeline, for failing to follow their own policies and the
state-approved spill-cleanup plan.
   Next year, when most legislators face re-election and a new
governor will be elected, oil industry influence will be a major
campaign issue, Cotten says.
   But Kerttula doubts concern over Big Oil's influence will last
long in a state that gets 85 percent of its revenues from the oil
industry.
   ``The industry always wins,'' he said. ``They've got very strong
economic clout and they're very firmly in control.''

   Chris Campabello once made $10 an hour as a
clerk in a Prudhoe Bay oilfield camp. Now she is working for free,
helping to rescue sea otters caught in the nation's biggest oil
spill.
   Each day from 6 a.m. to noon, she cracks clams and slices fish to
feed ailing otters. Each day, she feels a little better about
herself and a little worse about Big Oil.
   ``I used to believe in the oil companies. It was my job, and I
didn't want things to go badly for them,'' she says. ``I've changed
a lot.''
   So have many Alaskans in the last three months.
   The wreck of the Exxon Valdez unleashed a flood of emotion across
the nation as people mourned a pristine environment's lost innocence
and voiced anger at those who let it happen. For many Alaskans, the
anger and grief were compounded by the sense of personal
responsibility that comes from living in a state heavily dependent
on oil money.
   ``The relationship of Alaskans and oil development has always
been one of uncomfortable resignation,'' says Richard Gist, a
community psychologist from Overland Park, Kan., who helped Alaska
officials respond to the disaster.
   While some have likened the spill to a death in the family, Gist
says it's more like a messy divorce. ``In the end, you're always
telling yourself that you should have known better, that you
shouldn't have trusted the other so much,'' he says.
   Exxon accepted the blame for the accident, but many Alaskans
couldn't help but internalize the guilt, Gist says.
``Intellectually, folks know better. But emotionally, lots of people
feel it. They say, `I must have sold out.'''
   A good way to heal such emotional wounds, Gist says, is to regain
control by doing something _ anything _ to set things right. Many
Alaskans are following that advice.
   Cleanup officials and environmental groups have been flooded with
calls from Alaskans wanting to know what they can do to help. Otter
and bird rescue centers have more volunteers than they can use.
   ``When the spill hit, I got really upset,'' says Campabello, 29,
who is camping in a tent-trailer while volunteering at the Seward
otter rescue center. ``I felt it was really important not to sit
back and not do anything.''
   Reaction to the spill has evolved since March 24. ``The anger has
turned more to soul-searching, I think,'' says Dan Henry, a
schoolteacher in the southeastern Alaska town of Haines.
   ``Exxon and (tanker Capt. Joseph) Hazelwood are easy to blame.
But we are all to blame,'' Henry says. ``The people who are outraged
are the very same people who moved to Alaska because they loved the
pristine environment, and then supported the oil industry. They love
the world around them, but they brought their selfishness up with
them.''
   He admits he was among them, each year eagerly collecting his
dividend check from the Alaska Permanent Fund, a state savings
account fueled by oil revenues. Last year, the fund distributed $826
to every Alaskan.
   ``My dividend check is blood money,'' Henry says. ``I cannot hold
it in good conscience to accept that money anymore.'' He plans to
send this year's check to an environmental group and is urging
others to do the same.
   Gist says volunteering or getting politically active is valuable,
even if it accomplishes nothing but peace of mind. The key is doing
something that gives hope.
   Henry tells of some school kids in Homer who seemed to know that
without being told. As adults frantically built log booms to guard
the Kenai Peninsula town from drifting oil, the children were on the
beach, scratching messages in the sand. They wrote things like
``Ocean, we love you,'' and ``We're sorry, Mr. Sea.''
   They called them prayers to the ocean, and when one of the
children returned later to the beach, she ran to the same spot. The
tide, of course, had wiped the beach clean, but the little girl was
not disappointed.
   ``Look!'' she said. ``The ocean got our prayers.''

<HEAD>James Fenimore Cooper Is All But Forgotton on 200th Anniversary</HEAD>

   James Fenimore Cooper would be alive
today, at least in hearts and minds, if Mark Twain hadn't hammered a
stake through the heart of Natty Bumppo.
   Cooper's demise as the quintessential author of the American
frontier stems from a quirky essay written 44 years after his death,
Dan Porter, director of the New York State Historical Association,
said.
   Mark Twain's ``Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper'' put
Deerslayer, Leatherstocking and Natty's other incarnations out to
pasture somewhere on the prairie of forgotten adventure tales. Natty
Bumppo was the frontiersman who appeared in Cooper's stories found
in the ``The Leatherstocking Tales,'' including ``The Last of the
Mohicans,'' ``The Pathfinder,'' ``The Deerslayer'' and others.
   ``Mark really did him in,'' Porter said.
   The Historical Association is celebrating the 200th anniversary
of Cooper's birth. This summer, Porter hopes to shepherd 150,000
visitors to Cooperstown's Fenimore House and the Farmer's Museum,
both devoted to pioneer life.
   Even so, that turnout will be just half the average summer gate
for the other game in town, the Baseball Hall of Fame, which
celebrated its 50th anniversary this year.
   Porter wants Cooperstown pilgrims to know that Cooper put the
town on the map a decade before reputed baseball inventor Abner
Doubleday created the sport in Cooperstown.
   Unlike Twain, who remains popular, Cooper has been ``relegated to
the status of having written adventure books for kids and shoved on
the shelves of schoolchildren who would be just as happy to shove
him back,'' said Cooper aficionado Hugh MacDougall.
   Even without Twain, the wordiness and sermonizing of ``The Last
of the Mohicans'' and ``The Deerslayer'' probably would have eroded
Cooper's popularity. Cooper had no editor, so his books were printed
the way he wrote them. He considered revising a chore.
   Twain's scorecard credits Cooper with 114 literary offenses in
just two-thirds of a page. Readers couldn't tell Cooper's living
characters from his corpses, and neither showed ``sufficient excuse
for being there,'' Twain wrote.
   Cooper's characters also made the most of dialogue, wrote Twain,
complaining that a Cooper character's mouth ``was a rolling-mill,
and busied itself all day long in turning 4-foot pigs of thought
into 30-foot bars of conversational railroad iron.''
   ``Cooper characterizations may leave something to be desired,''
his great-great-grandson Henry S.F. Cooper Jr. said. ``But he did
create one well-rounded and extraordinary character with Deerslayer.
He has the same strength and immortality as Sherlock Holmes.''
   Early America's most popular writer, Cooper was the first to
break the snob barrier and gain acclaim in Europe.
   ``In Europe his characters came to represent the typical American
of the last century,'' said MacDougall, who has written a guidebook
_ ``Cooper's Otsego County'' _ to local sites important to the
author's works. Cooper drew on the Cooperstown wilderness for many
of his settings.
   Cooper was the first novelist of the American frontier, the first
to write sea novels and the first American author to earn his living
solely as a man of letters.
   His vivid descriptions of landscapes inspired the artworks of his
friends, Thomas Cole and Samuel Morse, and other Hudson River school
painters. Nineteenth century travel books lifted entire Cooper
passages to describe the American frontier.
   ``His place in American literature is unassailable,'' said Henry
Cooper, who writes on space issues for The New Yorker. ``He really
put the American novel on the map. He created the tradition of the
lonely hero, which transcends the Western novel. You can find it in
the novels of Theodore Dreiser and others.''
   Europeans remain fascinated by Cooper's writing. A German film
crew shot a documentary about Cooper last year, and many Europeans
visit Fenimore House each year, Porter said.
   ``The harder (critics) knock him, the more he stands, like one of
those clown balloons with a weight in the bottom that keeps popping
back,'' Henry Cooper said.
   Born Sept. 15, 1789 in Burlington, N.J., Cooper was an infant
when his father moved the family to Otsego Lake, called Glimmerglass
in Cooper's novels. A land speculator, William Cooper had picked up
100,000 acres there in a bankruptcy sale, founding the village that
bears his name.
   Before he started writing in 1819, Cooper was kicked out of Yale
College because of his pranks, went to sea as a common sailor and
served in the Navy.
   His sailing years were grist for such forgotten sea novels as
``The Pilot'' and ``The Red Rover,'' works that influenced Herman
Melville and Joseph Conrad.
   Besides the five Leatherstocking novels, works of social
criticism were among Cooper's 50 books, including a novel about
totalitarianism predating George Orwell's ``1984'' by more than a
century.
   William Eastman, director of the State University of New York
Press, which is publishing Cooper works that have been out of print
for decades, thinks the new Cooper editions will take the bite out
of Twain's essay.
   ``His earlier manuscripts and books were so corrupt, full of
typos and errors, that people sometimes didn't know what he was
writing about,'' Eastman said. ``All those funny things Twain wrote
about were caused by typos. Those things are no longer relevant with
these new editions.''
   ``We're going back to his original manuscripts and correcting the
errors,'' said James Beard, a Cooper specialist at Clark University
in Worcester, Mass., who is working on the new editions. ``Each time
they were reprinted they made new errors.''
   Bypassed by railroads and canals, Cooperstown retains many of its
19th century landmarks. Businesses along the village's narrow
streets also help remind visitors of Cooper's legacy _ Glimmerglass
Restaurant, Mohican Motel, Leatherstocking Travel.
   Cooper lived most of his life in Cooperstown and is buried in his
family's private cemetery there, 100 miles northeast of Twain's
grave in Elmira. Cooper died in 1851.
   Otsego Lake has largely escaped the 20th century, as well. With
no large industries and much of the lakeshore acreage owned by large
landowners, the lake remains pristine compared to those in the
Adirondacks to the north. Credited as the first conservation writer,
Cooper urged preservation of natural resources in many of his books.
   ``Would Cooper be pleased at the condition of his lake? Compared
with other lakes today, yes. Compared with the lake he remembers,
probably no,'' said biologist Bill Harman. Harman heads Oneonta
State College's Biological Field Station on Otsego Lake.
   Cooper became irascible and wrote little in his last years,
instead suing critics for libel and neighbors for trespassing. It
would have been time better spent writing, Porter said.
   Cooper never endeared himself to his public in the way that
turned Alcott, Hawthorne and Thoreau into tourism industries in New
England, he said.
   ``New York has not treated its literary lights well, not as well
as New England has,'' Porter said. ``Had Cooper been less of a
curmudgeon and more in tune with public relations, his fate would
have been better today.''

<HEAD>NEA Chief Leaving But Legacy Intact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She held her own against a bombastic education
secretary and turned her huge union into a force for school
improvement, challenges almost equal to her growing up poor and
black in the segregated South.
   Now the 2-million-member National Education Association must
choose a successor to Mary Hatwood Futrell, the voice of the
teachers union for six years and, some say, the best spokesman it
ever had.
   ``The NEA should light a candle to Mary. The organization owes
her a great deal,'' says Ernest Boyer, president of the
Princeton-based Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   Futrell is credited with shifting the NEA's focus from
self-protection to a more professional concern for better education.
Under her leadership, union delegates approved a Carnegie plan for a
national board to set standards and certify teachers.
   The union started spending its own money on curriculum
innovations and a foundation for education improvement that makes
grants for dropout and illiteracy prevention programs. It also
cooperated with administrators and principals on a joint guide to
teacher evaluation.
   NEA is still a union, committed to collective bargaining and
opposed in principle to merit pay plans supported by many outside
the teaching field. But its recent activities have gone a long way
toward eroding the obstructionist image that made it such an easy
target in the early 1980s.
   Some conservative educators believe Futrell has made only
marginal progress. ``Her organization under her leadership has moved
from the Middle Ages to the mid-18th century, and that's quite a lot
to accomplish in six years. On the other hand, that still leaves
them in the mid-18th century,'' says Chester Finn, who was an
assistant education secretary in the Reagan administration.
   Futrell, while admitting she would have liked to move faster on
some issues such as child care and school restructuring, defends the
NEA's pace. ``We would be the first to admit that our efforts are
just the beginning,'' she said. ``What's important is that we're
taking the steps. We've said we know we must change and let's try it
incrementally at first.''
   Nevertheless, when she presides over her final convention next
weekend, Futrell says she will tell the 8,000-odd delegates that
``you have to do more. You have to be bold and you have to take more
risks. What we've done is good, but it's not enough.''
   The far-flung union has had a reputation, not entirely
undeserved, for cumbersome bureaucracy and resistance to change.
Former President Reagan and former Education Secretary William
Bennett hammered at those flaws in repeated attacks on NEA, using it
as a symbol of all that was wrong with American education.
   Bennett denounced the NEA as intransigent and said its repeated
calls for more education spending revealed ``a cash-register
mentality.''
   Futrell gave as good as she got, pointing out that demands for
higher Pentagon spending never inspired that type of rhetoric from
the Reagan administration. But out in the field, she found teachers
in despair.
   ``The depression was so heavy,'' she recalled in an interview.
``You'd go in and it was like you were there as a missionary to try
to boost the morale of the school, month after month after month.''
   The years under administration fire turned out to have some
positive effects. There was a backlash of sympathy for teachers and
a new unity within the NEA. There was also a key decision by Futrell
about three years ago to take the offense, to move ahead with an NEA
agenda rather than keep responding to attacks.
   Futrell says now that had she known what her first three years
would be like, she would not have wanted the job. But, relying on
the survival skills she learned as a child, she proved a match for
both Reagan and Bennett. ``When you live with adversity ... you
force yourself to stand up,'' she said. ``You force yourself to
persevere. You force yourself to see positive things.''
   Futrell was raised in Lynchburg, Va., by a mother who had dreamed
of becoming a nurse but was forced by the deaths of her parents and
later her husband to work as a maid and short-order cook. Futrell
was not yet 5 when her father died.
   Her mother supported two daughters and two foster daughters on
$15 a week, sometimes working 18 hours a day, but always found time
to attend PTA meetings. She brought home books her employers had
discarded, held weekly spelling bees at home and punished Mary when
her grades were not satisfactory.
   As a little girl, Futrell wrote in an autobiographical essay, her
clothes sometimes had more holes than fabric and she once had to go
to school without shoes. At 8 she started helping her mother dust
church pews and office desks. By 12 she worked full-time during the
summer. When she graduated from her segregated high school, her
teachers raised scholarship money through local churches to enable
her to go to college. She honored them by becoming a teacher
herself, a business teacher in Alexandria, Va.
   Moving from state chapter president to national
secretary-treasurer to NEA president, Futrell emerged as a
charismatic leader so respected by her members that a room will be
set aside for tributes to her at the NEA convention next weekend.
   Her achievements win praise even from Albert Shanker, her
counterpart at the rival American Federation of Teachers. He took
her to lunch this month for the first time in six years, ``to tell
her what a great job I think she's done,'' according to Shanker.
``The people before her were not willing to take the risks or do the
hard work. When she did, she got results.''
   Futrell says she'll stay active in international education when
she steps down from her NEA post this summer. She also wants to
spend more time with her family and may pursue a graduate degree.
   The men vying for her title are Keith Geiger, currently vice
president of the NEA, and John Wilson, a member of the executive
committee. The outcome is expected to hinge on last-minute
campaigning at the convention.
   There are those who think it is impossible for NEA to be at once
an aggressive union and a respected professional association. But
Futrell says she has spent six years balancing those roles,
``forging a marriage that will last for a very long time without
sacrificing the integrity of either.''
   Chances are excellent that whether Geiger or Wilson is elected,
her legacy will endure. It's all been part of her plan, one of the
reasons she moved more slowly than she would have liked, taking the
time to educate and persuade and convert her members to each new
idea.
   ``I wanted to make sure that when I walk away on Aug. 31, that
change is in place, that the changes we've made will have roots,''
says Futrell. ``If you agitate people and encourage them to be part
of it, then they have ownership. And they will implement those
changes when you're long gone.''

   When Mary Hatwood Futrell became president of
the National Education Association, she often found herself
overshadowed by Albert Shanker, the longtime president of the rival
American Federation of Teachers.
   ``I would make a statement and it was like you made a statement.
Half an hour later, Shanker would come back and say the same thing
and people acted like he was a guru,'' she said. ``He is the AFT. It
is like a cult.''
   Futrell says she learned not to compete with Shanker, a
philosopher and provocateur with a knack for grabbing headlines, and
instead to talk and react from a teacher's perspective. ``Now a lot
of those people have come to respect and appreciate me,'' she said.
   The AFT, which claims about 700,000 members to the NEA's 2
million, embraced the education reform movement from the start,
while the lumbering NEA edged onto the bandwagon late and largely
due to prodding by Futrell.
   The two union leaders ``had some really bad clashes at the
beginning,'' Futrell said. Shanker, the AFT president since 1974,
now calls them ``the usual clashes of two rival organizations trying
to pick up members.''
   Now, Futrell says, ``we get along fine.'' Both insist the other
has changed.
   ``He has promoted himself to the position of statesperson so he
can't fight like he used to. It would not be becoming to him,'' says
Futrell, referring to Shanker's heavy involvement with the business
community and the political establishment.
   Shanker contends that Futrell started off with the typical NEA
view of reform _ ``Why are these people criticizing the schools?
Make them go away. Everything is pretty good.'' Unlike many, he
said, Futrell eventually became convinced that improvements were
needed.
   ``She underwent a change, a growth,'' Shanker said. ``She's a
different person today ... than she was three years ago. She's been
the best spokesperson for the NEA that I've ever known.''

<HEAD>Departing NEA Chief Gives Bennett Worst Marks as Education Secretary</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Teacher President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three education secretaries of the last
nine years would get grades ranging from A-minus to D from Mary
Hatwood Futrell, the outgoing president of the National Education
Association.
   Futrell gives her lowest mark of D to former secretary William
Bennett, who made repeated assaults on her organization during her
six-year tenure.
   ``Bill didn't know how to get people to work with him,'' she said
in an interview. ``He reminds me of the person who desperately wants
people to work with them and like them but doesn't know how to do
it. He knew how to give the speech but he didn't know how to get the
people to follow him.''
   Futrell reserves her highest mark of A-minus for Terrel Bell,
President Reagan's first education secretary. ``Bell was the leader,
the one who had the vision, the substance. He understood
education,'' she said.
   Futrell noted that Bell instituted the annual ``wall chart,'' a
state-by-state comparison of education indicators, and commissioned
the ``Nation at Risk'' report that fueled the education reform
movement. ``He saved the department,'' she said, alluding to
Reagan's campaign pledges to abolish it.
   The current secretary, Lauro Cavazos, receives a C-plus or
B-minus from Futrell. ``He's not being allowed to do well,'' she
said. ``Like Bell, Cavazos understands the issues. But he does not
have the kind of support he needs to do the job. He's being
hamstrung right now.''

could work to the disadvantage of Australia and other
sugar-exporting nations. Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the
Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said nothing in the measure would
alter present sugar quotas from countries outside the Caribbean.
   Since the Caribbean Basin Initiative was enacted in 1983 to help
lift the economy of the region, it has allowed duty-free import of a
variety of Caribbean exports. But it specifically exempts several
major categories, especially textiles.
   The Caribbean Basin Initiative expansion approved by the
committee removes the exception for textiles and apparel. It would
permit duty-free imports of fabric and clothing made from materials
deemed to be in short supply in the United States, and of textiles
from U.S.-made and -cut fabrics that are sewn in the Caribbean.
   The new legislation would mean U.S. buyers would no longer have
to pay an 8.1 percent tariff on clothes imported from the Caribbean.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., sought unsuccessfully to eliminate from
the bill most of the concessions toward Caribbean apparel. ``This
bill is a direct attack on the textile workers,'' he said.
   Jenkins' amendment would have required that any increase in
Caribbean textiles be offset by reductions in imports allowed from
Asia.

<HEAD>Tensions In International Trade Increasing, Says Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tensions have increased in international trade and
the commitment of governments to free trade talks is facing its
``sternest test,'' says the organization sponsoring the talks.
   The 1988 U.S. Trade Act could have the greatest short-term
adverse impact on the world trading system, the secretariat of the
96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said Tuesday in a
six-month review.
   The so-called Section 301 of the U.S. law could lead to moves
aimed at pressuring countries into bilateral trade accords outside
GATT's international trade rules, the review said.
   The United States last month singled out Japan, India and Brazil
for priority action under the law that calls for penalties against
countries deemed to be especially protectionist.
   Brazil and India will raise the issue at the two-day council
meeting beginning Wednesday, which is part of the latest four-year
GATT talks known as the Uruguay Round, a GATT source said on
condition of anonymity.
   The review said although much progress had been made in the
Uruguay Round, there had been ``a further increase in the
uncertainties and tensions affecting trade policies'' in the period
reviewed, the six months until last February.

   Florida exported a record 23.5 million
cartons of grapefruit this year, up 14 percent from the 1987-88
season, citrus officials said.
   Arthur Chadwell, general manager of the Citrus Administrative
Committee, attributed the sharp rise to favorable currency exchange
rates and increased spending on foreign promotions by the state
Department of Citrus.
   He said Japan remained the biggest importer, buying 12 million
cartons, up 10 percent from a year ago, followed by Europe, which
bought 8.8 million cartons, up 4 percent.
   The fastest-growing market was South Korea, whose imports of
609,000 were 306 percent higher than the previous year, Chadwell
said Monday.
   A grapefruit carton holds four-fifths of a bushel of fruit, or
about half of an 85-pound box.
   Fresh orange exports totaled 154,000 cartons, down from about
200,000 last season. Total fresh citrus shipments of all varieties
through early June, both domestic and offshore, fell 3.2 percent to
68.9 million cartons.

<HEAD>ABC Radio to Run Abortion Special Despite Lack Of Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC Radio Network officials say a special program
on abortion hosted by Barbara Walters will run today even though
national advertisers refused to buy time on the program.
   The 54-minute special airs starting at 2:06 p.m. EDT on about 144
radio stations across the country, ABC said.
   Lou Severine, senior vice president of sales for the network,
said Tuesday that he was able to find only one buyer _ ABC's
``20-20'' television show, which also features Ms. Walters _ for one
minute of the six minutes that were allocated for national ads.
   He said advertisers ``are scared to death of the abortion topic.
... They just don't want to be involved with any controversy.''
   But Philip Giordano, senior vice president at the radio network,
said the program was so important to the network's objectives of
providing timely programs on compelling topics that ABC was prepared
to absorb all of the costs of producing the show. The costs can run
to $12,000, he said.
   It is the latest example of advertisers backing way from programs
that have either offended or risk offending individuals or groups
who have become increasingly vocal in complaining about
controversial subjects on radio and TV.
   The NBC television network, for instance, had to cut prices to
find buyers for ad time on the made-for-TV movie ``Roe Vs. Wade,''
which ran last month and dealt with the case that led to the Supreme
Court's 1973 decision that legalized abortion.
   Advertisers have backed out of shows such as NBC's ``Saturday
Night Live'' and the Fox television network's ``Married ... with
Children'' after individuals or groups complained that they were
offended by sexual references or profanity in the shows.
   The ABC television network cancelled two reality-based shows
earlier this year because no advertisers signed up.
   But Jim Farley, executive producer of today's radio special on
abortion, said no one has called for a boycott because of the topic.
   ``This is different. This is the news. It will be a
straightforward, fair and balanced discussion of the issues,''
Farley said.
   The show will feature Ms. Walters as moderator of a panel that
will include two people from each side of the abortion question.
Listeners can call in with comments.
   Severine would not identify any of the national sponsors refusing
to buy time. He said the unfilled national ad time will be used for
public service announcements such as anti-drug or anti-crime
messages.
   The time was being offered at a rate of $6,000 per minute, he
said. No effort was made to reduce the price to attract sponsors.
``It was never really the money,'' Severine said.
   Giordano said stations in 21 of the nation's 25 biggest radio
markets have agreed to carry the special, which should attract an
audience of 1.1 million adults.
   He said there were some local stations that were reluctant about
carrying the program because of the topic and others didn't like
giving up midday programming time, although they get to sell eight
minutes of local ad time in the show.
   One of the stations planning to carry it is KOA in Denver, whose
manager of operations, Larry Crandall, applauded ABC's efforts and
said his station plans its own two-hour discussion on the issue
moderated by a prominent psychologist immediately after the ABC
special.
   He said KOA expects to fill its ad time on the special with
previously-purchased advertising commitments.
   The show is the first in what ABC Radio says will be a series of
American Agenda Radio Specials hosted by ABC's top TV news figures,
including ABC anchorman Peter Jennings and newsman Ted Koppel.
   ``I'm certain that as we continue this series that it will get
wider acceptance,'' Giordano said. The next program is tentatively
set for August and will deal with juvenile crime.

<HEAD>LIN's Board Rejects McCaw's Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it was
disappointed that the LIN Broadcasting Corp. board rejected as
inadequate its $5.85 billion takeover bid, but said it is willing to
discuss the offer.
   ``We remain confident that our $120-per-share price is full and
fair,'' Wayne M. Perry, McCaw's vice chairman, said in a letter
Tuesday to Donald A. Pels, chairman and president of LIN
Broadcasting of New York.
   The deal would be the biggest to date in the emerging cellular
telephone business and would extend McCaw's reach as the industry
leader.
   Cellular franchises have become increasingly lucrative as
improvements in technology have boosted customer demand for mobile
phones.
   LIN, which has interests in cellular telephones, television and
publishing, said in disclosing its board's decision Tuesday that it
was exploring alternatives including staying independent,
recapitalizing or selling itself to other potential buyers.
   McCaw's Perry, noting LIN's apparent willingness to talk to
potential suitors, said he hoped LIN would make available to McCaw
any non-public information that it shares with others.
   ``As we have previously stated, we are genuinely ready and
willing to meet with you to discuss our offer,'' he wrote.
   In national over-the-counter trading, LIN rose $2.62{ a share to
$125.62{ on Tuesday while McCaw rose 75 cents a share to $41.50.
   Analysts said they suspected Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw would
eventually sweeten its bid.
   ``McCaw wants LIN badly and will make counteroffers,'' said
Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst for the investment firm
Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
   Among those rumored to be interested in LIN have been the
regional Bell telephone companies, although some analysts have said
it is unlikely any one of them could afford the earnings dilution
that would result from buying LIN.
   ``For any one Bell company to buy all of LIN would be
considerable dilution and these companies have promised 6 percent to
7 percent to 8 percent earnings growth,'' said Geoffrey Johnson,
telecomunications analyst for Argus Research.
   A bid for LIN could drag down earnings for years as the debt
associated with making the acquisition would have to be repaid, he
said.
   If a Bell company were to get involved with LIN, Johnson said, it
was more likely that the Bell company would buy a partial stake in
LIN.
   LIN said its board decided unanimously that the unsolicited offer
from McCaw was inadequate and not in the best interests of the
company or its stockholders.
   In an effort to increase share value, LIN said, the company
intends to pursue its previously announced plan to spin off its
seven TV broadcasting stations into a new subsidiary.
   It also said it was studying steps to make sure its shareholders
would realize the extra value that would be created if LIN prevails
in its legal fight with Metromedia Inc. over the right to buy
Metromedia's interests in cellular systems in Philadelphia and New
York.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, LIN said
some industry analysts have estimated a victory for LIN in that case
would boost its stock value by $40 a share.
   LIN also said in the SEC filing that it had contacted potential
buyers and had met with them. It did not identify any of the
potential buyers but said they included some that have ``initiated
preliminary contacts in the past.''
   Bear Stearns' Leon said LIN and its financial advisers had done
``a brilliant job of getting investors excited and confusing them on
what they are offering'' in the latest filings.
   ``There is very slim chance that anyone would top McCaw,'' he
said.
   Analysts have valued McCaw's bid at as much as $290 per potential
cellular phone customer, or twice the $145 per potential customer
price that British Telecommunications PLC agreed to pay earlier this
year for a 20 percent stake in McCaw.
   McCaw and British Telecom announced separately Tuesday that they
had concluded the deal under which a British Telecom subsidiary paid
$1.37 billion for the stake in McCaw.
   LIN's interests include cellular systems serving New York, Los
Angeles, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston. Its seven TV stations are
network-affiliates and it owns a specialty publishing house that
provides hardcover tourist guides often available in hotel rooms.
   McCaw has major cellular franchises serving customers in Seattle,
San Francisco, Miami, Denver, Minneapolis and Portland, Ore.

<HEAD>Checchi Says Questions About Debt In NWA Deal Are `Laughable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alfred Checchi, who expects to meet this week
with Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner about his proposed $4
billion acquisition of Northwest Airlines, says fears about debt in
the deal are ``almost laughable.''
   ``The amount of debt in this proposal is not the least bit
excessive,'' Checchi said Tuesday. ``The hardest part of my day was
turning down all the banks that want to be part of this credit.''
   Checchi's investment group, Wings Holdings Inc., signed a deal
Monday to acquire Northwest parent NWA Inc. for $121 a share in
cash. The financing includes $700 million in equity and $3.35
billion borrowed from a syndicate of commercial banks.
   Skinner wrote a letter May 15 to NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier
saying the department was concerned about any acquisition that would
have a ``substantial adverse impact'' on the company's financial
structure. Checchi said he expects to meet with Skinner today or
Thursday in Washington, D.C.
   To complete a transaction by the Sept. 18 deadline imposed by
NWA, Wings needs a license from the Transportation Department, which
will examine the financial package to determine whether the group is
financially fit to safely operate the nation's fourth-largest
airline.
   Similar reviews have ranged in length from two months for an
extensive fitness check last year of Eastern and Continental
airlines to a six-month examination of Trans World Airlines that
ended earlier this year, a department spokesman said.
   ``People who are sophisticated in the area of corporate finance,
they're going to find that it's almost laughable that people are
bringing this up as a concern,'' Checchi said, ``but certainly it's
understandable.''
   But concern about debt in the Checchi deal prompted Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. to annouce Tuesday that the buyout would likely result
in a lower rating on NWA's senior debt.
   The acquisition would raise total debt at NWA to $3.7 billion
from $945 million, second only to Texas Air Corp. among airlines,
Standard &amp; Poor's said. The added annual interest expense of about
$300 million would consume most pre-tax earnings and almost cut
operating cash flow in half, the credit-rating agency said.
   It also said NWA's ``weakened financial strength'' would make the
carrier's plans for fleet modernization more expensive under the Los
Angeles investor.
   Checchi said Standard &amp; Poor's has not seen the details of his
group's deal. What's more important, he said, is that bankers are
lining up to get a piece of it.
   Despite skepticism, Guy Cook, president of the Machinists union
District Lodge 143, emerged Tuesday from a meeting with Checchi
confident that the airline could carry through its plan to double in
size in the next five years.
   ``I think it's probable at this point that we can establish
that,'' said Cook, who heads a 20,000-member union, the airline's
largest.
   Not as confident were leaders of the 5,000-member Northwest
pilots union, who also met with Checchi on Tuesday.
   ``Basically he said he feels that debt is his expertise and he
only talked about it in general terms,'' said Jim Halvorson, a
spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association unit. ``He said all
the things you'd expect him to say. He told us not to worry.''
   The pilots, who have an open contract and have threatened to
strike if they don't receive competitive wages and job security,
have said Checchi's deal would add debt that would be troublesome in
an economic downturn and possibly lead to layoffs.
   But Checchi said his group's financing package is strong enough
to carry the company through a recession as severe as the 1980-81
downturn.
   ``I would not enter any kind of transaction where the downside
was not provided for,'' he said.
   Checchi promised to provide pilots with details of his financing
package later in the week, Halvorson said.
   Halvorson said Checchi made a friendly gesture by saying he would
consider giving Northwest employees a stake in the company.
   Checchi, 41, said the concept proved popular at other companies
where he has worked, including Marriott Corp. But he said he won't
discuss the measure until the pilots settle on a contract because it
may be viewed as an attempt at gaining employee concessions.
   Cheechi said he hopes to close the deal within about four weeks
after the $121-a-share tender offer is launched Friday.

<HEAD>Lorenzo Greets New Pilots, Says He's Confident About Rebuilding Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo spoke with
confidence about Eastern Airlines' future as he personally assured
new pilots of a deep commitment to see the carrier succeed, despite
a crippling 3-month-old strike.
   ``Every day that goes by, you see more and more realization of
what we're doing,'' Lorenzo told reporters Tuesday following
graduation ceremonies for a group of Eastern recruits.
   ``An airline can be rebuilt, particularly an airline like
Eastern, because of the tremendous strengths and the tremendous
assets that the company has. I've been very encouraged by what I've
seen.''
   While Eastern, a unit of Texas Air, is selling assets to reduce
its debt, Lorenzo said the carrier is moving ahead with rebuilding
and has begun discussions with aircraft manufacturers on buying new
aircraft for the 1990s.
   Lorenzo said he thought the federal bankruptcy court overseeing
Eastern's reorganization will approve the airline's plan to rebuild
at two-thirds its prestrike size.
   He called the plan ``very, very reasonable ... a much more
practical solution'' than the unions' call for a new owner or the
leanings of some creditors toward complete liquidation.
   ``You do have creditors who are frustrated and they'd like to get
their money,'' Lorenzo said. ``We intend to make sure the company
honors its contracts and provides the creditors what they're due.''
   He called the union-backed buyout effort by Chicago commodities
trader Joseph Ritchie ``a joke'' and said there were no legitimate
buyers for Eastern as a whole.
   Eastern has ``been overwhelmed by the interest in most of these
assets'' it's offering for sale, but he declined to discuss pending
transactions.
   Earlier, Lorenzo, Eastern President Phil Bakes and other
executives were all smiles as they handed out diplomas and
congratulations to 18 Eastern pilot recruits who completed training.
   ``We are very, very committed to the success of Eastern
Airlines,'' Lorenzo told them.
   Company spokesman Robin Matell said Eastern has graduated 108 new
pilots since it began seeking recruits about a month after the
strike began March 4. He said there were 259 pilots who crossed the
picket lines, not including 17 more veteran pilots who have told the
company in the past week that they wish to return to work. There are
527 recruits in training, he said.
   Matell said Eastern is well on track toward having enough pilots
to carry out the airline's planned schedule expansion this summer.
   A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association disputed that
claim.
   ``We're not contradicting the statement in itself,'' said the
spokesman, who asked not to be identified. ``But by numbers and by
their own information, they are going to be able to fly the first
days of the schedule, but they're not going to be able to continue
to fly it'' due to lack of pilots.
   Eastern also announced Tuesday it will lease an A-300 Airbus jet
to VIASA, Venezuelan International Airways, for $1.4 million over
four months.
   ``It's consistent with our announced business plan to make $1.8
billion in assets transactions and use more than $900 million to pay
down debt,'' Matell said.
   Eastern is about $2.5 billion in debt. Earlier this month, its
Northeastern Shuttle service was handed over to New York developer
Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days
after its pilots and flight attendants unions joined a Machinists
union strike that crippled the airline.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York must approve
any asset sales. He approved the shuttle deal and the $277.5 million
sale last week of 15 planes and six aircraft engines to a company
that buys and resells airplane equipment.
   Eastern last week announced a deal to sell eight Philadelphia
airport gates, 16 jets and other assets to Midway Airlines for
$206.5 million. Lifland must approve that transaction, and Eastern
unions say they will challenge it.

<HEAD>Dollar Fluctuates in Narrow Range, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar ebbed and flowed in a narrow range
today, gaining against European currencies.
   Gold was down.
   Traders in Italy said the dollar's most significant movements in
the past few days came in Asian trading, while European trading was
calm.
   In London, the central bank intervened as the pound sterling
dropped as low as $1.5297 in the morning. The British currency also
slipped to 3.0498 West German marks, but rallied to 3.0531 after the
Bank of England stepped in.
   One dealer in London said the pound may have been hurt by strikes
that shut down rail, subway and bus service in the capital. ``If
one's got to hitchhike to work, it doesn't put sterling in good
grace,'' the dealer said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before the European markets open,
the dollar closed at 144.95, up 1.15 yen from Tuesday's close.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.9915 West German marks, up from
1.9775; 1.7278 Swiss francs, up from 1.7110; 6.7530 French francs,
up from 6.7025; 2.2446 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2255; 1,443.00
Italian lire, up from 1.431.75; and 1.1977 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2000.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5320, down from $1.5553 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $364.75, down from Tuesday's closing
price of $366.50. At mid-morning, the city's five major gold dealers
fixed a recommended price of $365.70.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $366.57, down from $366.95
late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.26 bid a troy ounce,
from $5.34.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index closed higher
today after early declines, while the U.S. dollar gained against the
Japanese yen.
   The doller closed at 144.95 yen, up 1.15 yen from Tuesday's
143.80-yen close. It opened at 144.85 yen and fluctuated from 144.73
yen to 145.03 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's strength followed its higher trend in
New York overnight.
   Yutaka Nakamura, a Daiwa Bank trader, said the currency stayed
just below 145 yen most of the day.
   ``Selling for profit-taking also helped to halt the dollar's
further rise,'' he said.
   ``Toward the end of the day, the dollar moved slightly up against
the yen as it rose against the major European currencies,'' Nakamura
added.
   The Bank of Japan sold an estimated $200 million in efforts to
curb the U.S. currency's rise, but it did not have much impact on
trading, Nakamura said. The central bank does not comment on its
foreign exchange market activities.
   Trading was inactive mainly because of uncertainties, he added.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which
gained 220.29 points the previous day, added another 111.81 points,
or 0.34 percent, closing at 33,345.28.
   After early losses, the index reversed the trend and rose in the
afternoon.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said the
index began to climb when institutional investors bought ``a
substantial amount'' of cheaper issues.
   In addition, he said, foreign investors were buying in arbitrage
deals between the spot and futures markets.
   The dollar's rebound had no negative impact on Wednesday's stock
trading, but trading was thin, Nomura said.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 600 million
shares, down from Tuesday's 700 million.
   ``Investors would not panic over dollar-yen fluctuations between
143 and 146 yen. But they are little motivated in buying at the
moment since last week's wild fluctuations,'' Nomura added.
   Last week, the dollar closed at 151.30 yen on Thursday, its
highest level in almost two years. It then lost 6.25 yen on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Nikkei lost more than 1,100 points during the week.
   Among today's gainers were steel and shipbuilding issues.

<HEAD>Some Rural Areas Left Out of Redevelopment Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of most economically depressed rural areas
of the country may be left out of a key part of legislation promoted
by the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, say officials
of local development commissions.
   The bill sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., would provide
$300 million to start a revolvng loan fund, but requires local
matching funds for communities to receive any of the money.
   ``It's OK to an extent, but when you get into the hardest hit
rural areas, the reason there's no economic development there in the
first place is because they can't afford it,'' Vernon D. Martin,
executive director of the Planning and Development Commission in
Brunswick, Ga., said Tuesday.
   George Alford, executive director of the Alabama-Tombigbee
Regional Commission in Camden, Ala., said he is disappointed the
bill does not link the local match requirement to each community's
ability to pay.
   Alford said his agency can't use existing federal economic
development revolving loan funds because most of the communities the
agency serves don't have the resources for the local match.
   The only exception to the matching fund requirement would be for
communities with per capita income that is less than 70 percent of
the national average. Then, only a 50 percent local match would be
required.
   Kaye Braaten of the National Association of Counties said her
group is happy the bill requires applicants for revolving loans to
notify county governments and work with state, regional and local
governments in investment strategies.
   But she said her organization is disappointed that there is
little funding for infrastructure.
   ``This is clearly the No. 1 need in rural counties,'' she said,
adding that her group hopes more money will be forthcoming to
rebuild rural roads and bridges.
   Martin, Alford and Braaten were among dozens of local economic
development officials from across the country at a news conference
arranged by Leahy to tout the bill he calls ``landmark legislation.''
   Other key provisions of the bill would set up satellite
educational and health communication systems and provide funds for
improving drinking water.
   Despite their complaints about the local match requirements, both
Martin and Alford said Leahy's legislation would provide a needed
shot in the arm to rural America.
   They said they hope to persuade the House or the House-Senate
conference committee that will work out final details of the bill to
ease the local match requirements for distressed rural areas.
   Leahy said he expects the measure to be approved by the full
Senate next month and would like to see it used as a model for the
House.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., whose House Agriculture subcommittee
on conservation, credit and rural development is working on its own
bill, said he had seen a version of the Leahy measure.
   ``There are some good points about that legislation, and I think
it is fine as far as it goes,'' English said. ``I don't think
legislation drawn up by any one house is going to be the best
approach to all the problems in rural America.''
   English's subcommittee is half through a lengthy series of
hearings in Washington and will hold more in August in five regions
of the country.
   He said legislation will be crafted after all the witnesses have
spoken, probably early fall.
   He said a bill could be passed by the House by December but his
goal is sometime this session, which doesn't end until December 1990.

      WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former Secretary of Agriculture John Block will
lead a trade and development mission to Jamaica and Ecuador this
fall, says Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   Yeutter announced Tuesday that Block, who served as secretary
from 1981 to 1986, will head a delegation comprising representatives
of the State and Agriculture departments, U.S. Agency for
International Development, and the private sector.
   ``Jamaica and Ecuador are important markets for U.S. agricultural
products,'' said Yeutter. ``Former Secretary Block's background and
experience with various export programs enables him to represent all
U.S. agriculture export interests in these growing markets.''
   Block is now president of the National American Wholesale
Grocers' Association in Washington.

   A United Auto Workers dissident group lost
a third, key battle at the union's constitutional convention, but
despite the outcome, the group's leader says he is happy with the
way it went.
   About 2,000 delegates to the UAW's constitutional convention
turned back an attempt Tuesday by the New Directions movement to
limit Japanese-style labor-management programs on factory floors.
   The decision came on two show-of-hands votes in which no more
than 20 percent of the delegates supported the New Directions effort.
   Today, delegates are scheduled elect top national and regional
officers. UAW President Owen Bieber faces no opposition to a third,
three-year term. The convention also will elect two vice presidents
to replace retiring vice presidents Donald Ephlin and Marc Stepp.
   Later, Bieber will assign the vice presidents to head the union's
various departments, including one for each of the Big Three
automakers and another with administrative responsibility for
agricultural implement and aerospace workers covered by the union.
   Despite the overwhelming loss Tuesday, New Directions leader
Jerry Tucker of St. Louis said he was happy with his troops and
their reception.
   ``I think it was a good debate,'' he said. ``Debate on the floor
today was healthy.''
   Tucker held out the possibility that there would be more from New
Directions forces, especially next year when the UAW plots its
strategies for negotiations with the Big Three automakers. Contracts
between the UAW and General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. expire Sept. 14, 1990.
   Tucker said he was pleased with the way Bieber handled the
debate, which sometimes got a little rowdy, and hoped that delegates
would take the New Directions message back to their locals.
   ``The rank and file will ultimately find ways to express
themselves,'' he said.
   The loss Tuesday was the third by New Directions forces since the
convention opened Sunday. It winds up Friday.
   During the first two days of the convention, New Directions
backers failed in an attempt to require rank-and-file referendum
voting for top national officers, instead of a vote by convention
delegates, and lost a credentials fight for seating some delegations.
   Members of the movement made a loud entrance to the convention
hall Tuesday. About 250 delegates and alternates paraded in carrying
signs and shouting: ``What do we need? New Directions. When do we
want it? Right now.''
   Bieber ignored the parade as it passed in front of the stage.
   Delegate Tony Torres of Local 653 in Pontiac, Mich., stood on a
chair in front of Bieber, waved a New Directions placard and
shouted, ``We don't have to go to China; Injustice is right here.''
   Tucker watched the demonstration from the stage. When asked how
it made him feel, he said, ``Bigger.''

   Stock prices moved higher Wednesday as the market
seemed unperturbed by the fall of the pound and a nationwide
transportation strike.
   Volume was low as today's national rail strike, combined with a
walkout by subway and bus drivers in London, left many brokerages
and institutions understaffed.
   Much of the trading volume was in the pharmaceutical and
electronics sectors, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index was up 11.6 points,
or 0.5 percent, at 2,176.4 at midday.
   Volume was a scant 176.1 million shares.
   The pound was quoted at $1.5345 and 3.0514 West German marks
around midday Wednesday, down from $1.5475 and 3.0632 marks late
Tuesday in London.

<HEAD>FDIC Chief Considers Seeking More Power Over S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: SUBS last graf with 5 new grafs to include Treasury Department
comment</HEAD>

   L. William Seidman, who would become the new
deposit insurance czar under legislation moving through Congress, is
conferring with the Bush administration about an idea that would
enhance his power over the savings and loan bailout.
   Under the plan, Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., would have greater authority than originally
envisioned by the administration within the Resolution Trust Corp.,
a new agency being created to oversee the closing or sale of
insolvent thrift institutions and of real estate repossessed by the
S&amp;Ls.
   Under bills passed by the House and Senate, the RTC will be run
by a board headed by the Treasury secretary. It would have an
oversight staff, headed by an executive director. But, as the
administration envisions the structure, most of the work would be
contracted out, presumably to the FDIC.
   According to an industry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Seidman wants the FDIC to report directly to the RTC
oversight board rather than through a staff working for the board.
   Ultimate authority would still rest with the RTC board, but
without the separate staff there would be less opportunity for
administration second-guessing of Seidman's agency. Also, the FDIC _
not the RTC board _ in practice would choose which private firms are
hired for the lucrative job of assisting the government in the huge
undertaking.
   Seidman, in a telephone interview Tuesday, declined to say his
agency is advocating the idea, but he described it as ``worth
exploring'' and ``feasible.''
   ``It's not our idea. It came from a suggestion that the GAO (the
congressional General Accounting Office) made. We have been talking
to Treasury about it,'' he said.
   The RTC, under legislation that passed the House last week and
the Senate in April, will have the mammoth task of spending $50
billion in new bailout funds and of handling $300 billion to $500
billion of bad loans and property. That would make it, if it were
private, the largest corporation in the United States.
   The legislation does not spell out how the RTC will be structured
beyond the composition of its board and the fact that it must hire a
chief executive officer. It does not define the relationship between
the FDIC and RTC.
   However, Seidman has said he does not want his agency to get
expanded responsibility without added authority to control the
conditions and terms under which it does the additional work.
   Seidman said if the FDIC were not given the added authority, and
were simply a contractor of the RTC, it would want to pick and
choose what S&amp;L liquidation work it wanted.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins said the
administration has planned all along for the FDIC to take the lead
role in disposing of failed S&amp;Ls. At issue, he said, is the vigor of
administration oversight.
   ``No one likes the idea of a full-time person overseeing them.
But our view is we're required to have oversight,'' he said. The
FDIC ``wants as much independence as (it) can get, but there's a
limit as to what can be done on that.''

traders awaited new indications of the future course of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 2.09 to 2,470.79
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 469 up, 398 down and
536 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.61 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates moved slightly lower in the government securities
market today.
   Analysts said traders were expecting new evidence of a slowing
economy when the Federal Reserve issued a periodic report, known as
the ``beige book,'' later today on the state of the economy.
   But that failed to stir up much enthusiasm for stocks. Many Wall
Streeters lately have voiced concerns that stock prices might be due
for a pause or pullback after their strong advance since late last
year.

   H.J. Heinz Co. said Wednesday its
fourth-quarter earnings jumped 15.2 percent as its sales increased
11 percent.
   The food company reported earnings of $117.2 million, or 89 cents
per share, in the quarter ended May 3, compared with $101.6 million,
or 77 cents per share, for the same period a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter jumped to $1.6 billion compared with $1.4
billion for the year-ago period, the company said.
   Improved volume in Italian baby food and Weight Watchers brand
food products, primarily in the United Kingdom, and higher prices
contributed to the sales increase, the company said.
   Net income for the full fiscal year increased 14 percent to $440
million, or $3.34 per share, compared with $386 million, or $2.91
per share, for fiscal 1988.
   Sales for the year totaled $5.8 billion, a 10.6 percent gain from
$5.2 billion recorded in 1988.
   Heinz said the sales increase was due to price increases,
significant volume gains, and acquisitions in the pet food area and
foreign markets.

<HEAD>Employees Have More Savings Choices, Pay More Medical Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salaried employees of large U.S.
companies are paying a bigger share of their medical expenses than
they did five years ago, according to a soon-to-be-released study of
employee benefits.
   The same workers face a wider array of employer-sponsored savings
plans, and are increasingly being asked to take a more active role
in designing their own benefits packages.
   ``There is a desire among employers to involve employees more in
all aspects of benefits,'' said Howard Levin, a partner in Hewitt
Associates, the suburban Chicago consulting firm that conducted the
survey of 227 major employers.
   ``There's a sense that when employees participate, they get
involved more and have a greater appreciation'' for their benefits,
Levin said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his Lincolnshire
office.
   The study will be released publicly early next month, said Hewitt
spokeswoman Jean Campbell.
   Medical plans are paying more catastrophic-illness costs but
employees are paying a larger share of other medical expenses,
researchers discovered.
   Hewitt found that just 29 percent of the survey respondents'
medical plans covered 100 percent of hospital room and board
charges, compared with 53 percent in 1984.
   The more typical practice is for the plan to cover 80 percent of
hospital charges and require employees to pay 20 percent up to a
specified maximum, usually $2,000 or less. The plan then kicks in
and pays 100 percent.
   Employers also are trying to better manage medical costs by
encouraging employees to seek second surgical opinions and have
medical tests done on an outpatient basis.
   In 1984, Hewitt found that 62 percent of companies surveyed
offered the same medical coverage for surgery whether or not the
employee got a second opinion. In 1988, only 29 percent of the
respondents offered the same coverage regardless of whether a second
opinion was obtained.
   ``Cost-sharing causes people to be more careful consumers of
health-care services,'' Levin said. ``The employee who has to pay
for part of any service they use is going to use more discretion.''
   The survey revealed a dramatic increase _ from 56 percent in 1984
to 82 percent in 1988 _ in the prevalence of employer-sponsored
401(k) plans. These optional savings plans usually supplement
traditional pension plans and offer tax benefits superior to
individual retirement accounts.
   Among retirement savings plans, the survey found a trend toward
more investment options such as company stock, stock-market mutual
funds and guaranteed-income instruments.
   Levin said retirement savings options have grown in response to
the changing demographics of the work force, which was once composed
mainly of married men with families but now includes large numbers
of both sexes, married and single, some with children, some without.
   ``We have a work force with a much broader diversity of needs,''
he said. ``Some have high retirement-income needs, some have
low-retirement income needs.''
   In addition to providing a new way for employees to set aside
money for retirement, a 401(k) plan ``takes some of the pressure off
of employers to funnel more dollars into the pension plan, no doubt
about it,'' Levin said.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. said today it will sell its Chun
King food division for $52 million to a group of investors from
Singapore.
   The sale is part of Nabisco's continuing effort to reduce debt

   RJR Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said the agreement was reached
with Yeo Hiap Seng Limited and Fullerton Holdings Pte. Ltd., a

   The consumer products giant agreed to sell the Chun King
trademark, under which its line of shelf-stable Oriental food
products is marketed, as well as sauce manufacturing equipment in
St. Theresa, Canada, and production facilities in Cambridge, Md.,
and Ontario, Canada.
   The sale is pending approval of the Federal Trade Commission.
   RJR sold the Chun King frozen food line to ConAgra Inc. in 1986.
   Earlier this month, French food and beverage giant BSN bought
several of RJR's European units, including the United Kingdom
biscuit business of Nabisco Brands; snack makers Walker's Crisps and
Smith's Crisps; and biscuit and pastry businesses in France and
Italy.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened slightly
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade, continuing a retreat
prompted by forecasts for scattered thunderstorms in the Midwest.
   Traders are keeping a close watch on weather conditions in
western Iowa and southwestern Minnesota, where rain was expected
today.
   The threat of precipitation _ with expected amounts ranging from
\ inch to 1{ inches _ is alleviating the drought fears that prompted
a strong rally in the crop markets during the past week. Prices
began falling on Tuesday.
   The showers are expected to move across the Corn Belt over the
next several days, with clearing skies and cooler temperatures
predicted for the weekend.
   The wheat market continued to be pressured by selling linked to
harvest activity in the Great Plains and uncertainty over U.S.-China
relations. Some experts fear tensions between the two countries may
impede sales of U.S. grain to China.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was } cent to
1{ cents lower with July at $2.65{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 2

   The new owners of R.P. Scherer Corp. have laid
off 50 to 60 workers and put five subsidiaries up for sale so the
company can concentrate on its basic capsule-making business,
Scherer President Alex Erdeljan said.
   Since its sale earlier this month to a New York investment group,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., Scherer has closed a 21-person
Ann Arbor research and development office and laid off 27 of the 37
workers at its Troy headquarters, Erdeljan said Tuesday.
   The five subsidiaries, ranging from a New Jersey pharmaceutical
maker and packager to a chain of eyewear stores, employ about 1,900
of Scherer's 4,400 workers and accounted for about 30 percent of the
company's 1988 sales of $290.7 million.
   Paco Pharmaceutical Services Inc. of Lakewood, N.J.; Franz Pohl
GmbH in West Germany; Lorvic Corp. and Scientific Associates Inc. in
St. Louis; and Southern Optical Co. of Greensboro, N.C., will be
sold within 180 days, Erdeljan said.
   Scherer is the world's largest producer of gelatin capsules for
products such as vitamins, drugs and bath oil, with operations in 13
countries.
   ``The cuts are necessary to trim us down and turn us into a
stronger competitor,'' Erdeljan said.
   The company was sold after a proxy battle between Karla Scherer,
daughter of Scherer's founder and the largest shareholder in the
company, who favored selling, and her estranged husband, Peter Fink.
   Fink, who opposed the sale, resigned in November as Scherer
president and chief executive officer.

   The stock market turned mixed late this morning
as traders awaited new indications of the future course of the
Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.03 to 2,475.91 by
noon on Wall Street. An hour earlier the blue chip average was down
about 4{ points.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by a narrowing margin in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 565 up, 649
down and 561 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 72.53 million shares at midday
compared to 77.43 million at the same point in Tuesday's session.
   Interest rates edged upward in the government securities market
today, reversing an early decline.
   Analysts said traders were waiting to see if new evidence of a
slowing economy surfaced when the Federal Reserve issued a periodic
report, known as the ``beige book,'' later today on the state of the
economy.
   That left little enthusiasm for stocks. Many Wall Streeters
lately have voiced concerns that stock prices might be due for a
pause or pullback after their strong advance since late last year.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down \ at
40]; Eastman Kodak, down \ at 47}; USX, down ] at 37[, and Union
Carbide, down | at 28|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up by 0.03 to 179.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off 0.18 at 361.54.

   A wildcat strike inflamed by two
shootings spread to more than 35,000 miners in Appalachia and the
Midwest by today after thousands of miners in Illinois, Kentucky and
Ohio joined the work stoppage.
   At least 40 Illinois mines reported a total of more than 8,000
miners who failed to show up for work, and hundreds more joined the
walkout in Ohio and western Kentucky. But employees at four small
Kentucky mines returned to work at midnight Tuesday after the
release of three jailed union leaders.
   Meantime, CSX Transportation Inc. reported that the railroad's
coal loadings were down about 1,000 cars per day because of the
strike, putting 300 workers at least temporarily off the job.
   ``If the strike continues and spreads, the jobs of as many as
2,500 employees could be affected,'' said John W. Snow, president
and chief executive officer of CSX Transportation, headquartered in
Jacksonville, Fla.
   CSX spokeswoman Suzanne Walston estimated the miners' strike has
reduced by by 15 percent the number of cars loaded daily by the
company.
   Some union and industry officials had predicted an end to the
walkouts with the release of the union leaders jailed in Virginia
for their actions in a strike against the Lebanon, Va.,-based
Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   The three were released Monday night. On Tuesday, they promised a
federal judge they would abide by his order banning sit-down
demonstrations to block coal trucks at Pittston plants.
   But today, more than 200 cars and pickups drove up and down the
roads in front of the entrances to the plants, continuing a convoy
tactic that resulting in the ticketing of 22 people Tuesday for
impeding traffic.
   Nearly 1,700 United Mine Workers members walked off their
Pittston jobs in Virginia and West Virginia on April 5 after working
more than 14 months without a contract. The strike spread to
Pittston's Kentucky operations Monday, idling 200 more UMW members.
   Pittston had dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association to negotiate independently.
   The unauthorized walkouts began June 12 after a UMW rally in
Charleston to protest Pittston's action and to protest the fines and
jail terms assessed union members in Virginia.
   Shootings were reported Tuesday in Alabama and West Virginia.
   In Sumiton, Ala., Assistant Police Chief Steve Jacks said a coal
truck was hit by five bullets. He said the driver, whom he refused
to identify, was not struck by any of the .22-caliber rounds, but
did complain of grittiness in his eyes, possibly caused from the
broken windshield. The truck belongs to Black and Gold Trucking, an
independent Sumiton company.
   Jacks said the shooting was strike-related and police were
investigating, but no arrests had been made.
   ``At this time, we are working closely with some union people to
try to get some tempers down,'' Jacks said. ``I think we are making
some gain and can come to a neutral standoff.''
   In West Virginia, where almost two-thirds of the wildcat strikers
are located, strike-related gunshots were reported in Mingo County,
but no arrests were made and no one was reported injured.
   Wildcat strikers also headed to southwest Virginia coal fields to
try to slow Pittston coal shipments.
   ``They've just got the place saturated with people; it's pretty
well blocked up,'' said Virginia state police Lt. C.F. Eaton.
   One of the freed union leaders, Marty Hudson, field commander,
said he's optimistic miners can beat Pittston. Hudson said the
wildcat strikers fear a Pittston victory could set a precedent.
   ``They see what Pittston is doing as a threat to their unions,''
Hudson said. ``If Pittston is successful, it will directly affect
their lives.
   A union official in Illinois said the release of the union
leaders may help take the steam out of the strike in his state.
   ``That's real helpful to me,'' said Kerry Emmons, the president
of UMW Local 1791, which represents 655 wildcat strikers. ``That is
a step in the right direction in getting my people to work.''
   Wildcat strikes also were being conducted in Pennsylvania,
Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee.

   Paramount Communications Inc. moved today to get
a court order blocking Time Inc.'s proposed $14 billion acquisition
of Warner Communications Inc.
   Paramount, an entertainment and publishing concern, has launched
its own $10.7 billion offer for Time, a leading magazine publisher
and cable operator.
   Time has rejected Paramount's bid.
   In trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Time was up $3 a
share to $155.50. Time had fallen more than $18 a share over the
past three trading days since it launched its bid for Warner and
rejected Paramount's offer.
   Warner was down 12{ cents a share at $59.37{ at midday while
Paramount was down 75 cents a share at $58.62{.
   In a revision of an earlier suit filed in Delaware Chancery
Court, Paramount asked for an order voiding the Time tender offer
and merger agreement with Warner.
   It also asks for nullification of any vote to elect directors at
Time's annual meeting, which is scheduled for June 30. Among the
directors up for election are Time's chairman and chief executive,
J. Richard Munro, and its president, Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr.
   Time said Paramount's allegations in the new complaint were
``without merit'' and said the amended complaint ``appears to be
designed to provide copy for the press rather than to make a case
before a court.''
   Time stock, which was trading at $126 before Paramount announced
its bid June 6, has climbed as high as $182.75 during the past two
weeks.
   Peter Appert, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., said Time's stock price could turn around again if the market
perceives that the advantage in the struggle for Time was shifting
toward Paramount.
   Time stock has fallen because investors believe ``the odds are
greater or improving that Time is going to succeed with its bid for
Warner'' and that Paramount's bid for Time will fail, Appert said.
   But, Appert said, the market had no concrete information or
developments to support its speculation, and it was still widely
expected that courts in Delaware _ where all three companies are
incorporated _ ultimately would decide the outcome of the takeover
fight.
   Paramount has bid $175 a share for Time, which rejected the offer
and said it would continue to pursue a merger with Warner. On
Friday, Time announced it was revising its earlier stock-swap merger
agreement with Warner and was launching a $70-a-share tender offer
for the company.
   Time contends the Paramount offer is uncertain because it is
dependent on obtaining financing and because Paramount must obtain
regulatory approval before it can acquire the franchises to about
800 cable television systems Time owns.
   Appert said the takeover fight could turn on whether Time, in
agreeing to the merger with Warner in March, effectively put itself
up for sale. If the courts decide that is the case, Time directors
could be forced to seek the highest price for the company's stock
and the Paramount bid might then succeed.
   Wall Street _ in depressing Time's stock _ is betting the courts
will side with Time and allow the directors to pursue an acquisition
of Warner.
   Meanwhile, in filings with the Federal Communications Commission
Tuesday, Warner charged that Paramount's bid for Time violates the
1984 Cable Act and FCC rules and Paramount told the commission it
should set aside a ruling allowing Time to transfer control of its
cable TV systems to Time-Warner.
   Paramount said Time had misrepresented to its stockholders the
nature of the transfer and that Time had written to state attorneys
general asking them to oppose Paramount's proposal without notifying
Paramount of the letters.
   These actions raise ``questions about Time's character
qualifications,'' Paramount said, asking the FCC to set aside its
approval of the license transfers pending an investigation.
   Paramount earlier this month asked the FCC for permission to give
control of Time to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld pending
FCC approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and
licenses held by Time's subsidiary, American Television and
Communications Corp.
   Art Harding, a lawyer for Warner, said Tuesday Paramount's
request ``would violate the recent Cable Act because Rumsfeld hasn't
gotten consent from any of these cities for the transfers.''
   Harding, echoing assertions Time made against Paramount in a June
13 FCC filing, said Paramount's plan would ``undermine the delicate
balance'' established in the 1984 Cable Act for regulation of cable
systems by local authorities.
   Warner asked the FCC late Monday to deny the application made by
Paramount and its subsidiary, KDS Acquisition Corp., for expedited
consent to transfer control of Time to Rumsfeld and then to
Paramount.
   In a separate development, Warner cancelled the June 23
shareholder's meeting it had scheduled for a vote on the original
merger plan with Time.
   Time earlier had rescheduled its June 23 shareholders' meeting
until June 30 and said it would deal with election of directers and
nothing related to the merger with Warner.

   Ivan F. Boesky, the one-time stock baron at the
center of Wall Street's fraud scandals, is pumping iron and growing
a beard at a California prison, a published report says.
   Boesky also is deeply tanned and jogs daily on the outdoor track
at the minimum-security federal prison camp in Lompoc, Calif.,
Manhattan inc. magazine reports in its July issue.
   The 52-year-old former speculator in April completed one year of
a three-year sentence for pleading guilty of conspiracy to lie to
the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with
allegations of insider trading.
   Boesky paid the SEC $100 million in alleged ill-gotten profits
and penalties in late 1986 to settle charges he used illegal inside
information to profit on securities deals.
   He was eligible for parole in March, but declined to apply. A
federal judge recently rejected his appeal for a reduced sentence,
and his earliest possible release date based on good behavior is
April 4, 1990.
   Quoting unidentified visitors to Boesky, Manhattan inc. said the
convicted arbitrager whose confessions have spawned several other
Wall Street fraud prosecutions has grown a full white beard and is
``impressively muscled.''
   ``Boesky works out every day at the outdoor weight area Lompoc
provides inmates, and he has built himself up substantially,'' the
magazine said. ``He jogs daily on Lompoc's makeshift track.''
   The magazine said that Boesky's bodybuilding ``is probably in
part to insure that he is able to defend himself'' because he feared
for his safety when he entered the prison 15 months ago.

   A group of semiconductor companies
today announced the formation of a manufacturing corporation that
expects to raise more than $1 billion over several years to boost
U.S. production of memory chips.
   The plan, which sets up a corporation named U.S. Memories Inc.,
calls for the venture to be funded by microchip makers and their
major customers.
   Companies which contributed ``seed money'' to form the
corporation include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp.,
Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor.
   ``The time is right for a collective memory manufacturing venture
in the United States to improve America's market position in what is
truly a critical technology,'' said Sanford L. Kane, president and
chief executive officer of the newly formed corporation and a former
vice president at IBM.
   The venture is aimed at lessening the dependence on Japan for
DRAMs, the dynamic random access memory chips that are important to
computers, consumer electronics and advanced military hardware.
   U.S. companies, which once led the DRAM business, account for
about 15 percent of the $12 billion North American market.
   Another chip consortium, called Sematech, researches new
manufacturing technologies but cannot build commercial products. It
is funded with $100 million annually from the Defense Department and
an equal amount from 14 U.S. chipmakers.
   U.S. Memories is expected to begin by setting up a high-volume
plant to make a new generation of DRAM that can store 4 million bits
of information.
   Japanese companies are just beginning to ship samples of the
four-megabit varieties that offer four times the storage of the
one-megabit chips often found in personal computers.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association has been organizing the
consortium.
   ``Any consortium that brings together U.S. electronics companies
to further our global advantage is a step in the right direction,''
said William Krause, chairman of the American Electronics
Association. ``I find this to be a very positive step.''

   Japanese businessmen cautiously are returning to
China, hoping to resume the business that they long have conducted
in that market while remaining wary of another outbreak of unrest.
   Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka has criticized businessmen for
returning too quickly _ saying they invited charges that they are
``trying to make money like a thief at a fire'' _ but the government
has not formally asked firms to refrain from business.
   Japan has been more cautious in its criticism of China than the
United States, which is pushing for the suspension of all new World
Bank loans to protest the Chinese government's bloody suppression of
pro-democracy demonstrations two weeks ago.
   ``For the time being the Japanese government is not considering
sanctions,'' but is continuing to gather information, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa told a news conference Wednesday.
   Nevertheless, on Tuesday Foreign Ministry officials said
negotiations on a new five-year, $5.6 billion loan package to China
were not being conducted, but Japan would decide whether to resume
talks after watching the situation in China.
   Sanctions by Japan could be more serious than sanctions by the
United States because Japan's trade with China is larger _ $19.3
billion last year _ and because Japan provides 80 percent of China's
foreign loans.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno has expressed regret at the Chinese
crackdown but so far has stressed maintaining good long-term ties
with China. He and other officials have cited Japan's pre-World War
II invasion of China as a major reason for reluctance to criticize
the Chinese government.
   The government's cautious attitude has been criticized as too
weak by some of the Japanese press and some business leaders.
   But many businessmen want the government to help smooth
resumption of business. They fear that U.S. economic sanctions could
harm the general business environment and the suspension of World
Bank loans could hurt China's ability to conduct trade with Japan.
   If the United States cut trade ties with China, ``some Japanese
companies might take up the slack,'' said Jan VanDenBerg, an
economist at Merrill Lynch Securities in Tokyo. ``However, it's
unlikely they would take up the slack in U.S. direct investment in
China. U.S. sanctions would be a disincentive for anyone else to
invest,'' she said.
   The Chinese government has been trying to woo foreign businessmen
back with reassurances that its economic open-door policy remains
intact. Some traders say China even has speeded up the normally
glacial paperwork required to do business.
   Japanese traders view these assurances with skepticism, but like
many Americans are trying to maintain business ties while carefully
watching the situation, said Hiroaki Kasahara, general manager of
the China department at Marubeni Corporation.
   Major trading houses have sent limited numbers of staff back to
China to carry out existing contracts and monitor the situation,
said a trader who declined to be named.
   Trading houses said that even at the height of the unrest,
shipments in and out of China did not stop, although there were some
slowdowns. Production at a number of joint-venture factories far
from Beijing and Shanghai were undisturbed by events in the capital.
   Japanese banks and securities houses do not plan to send staff
back to China for now, while a number of manufacturers plan to
proceed with plans for joint ventures, Japan Broadcasting
Corporation reported.
   Kumagai Gumi, a major construction company, said it has not
resumed work on a 51-story Beijing building stopped during the
unrest.
   ``We're not sure yet if there are workers and materials
available,'' said Makoto Sasaki, a company spokesman. None of the
company employees who were evacuated have returned to Beijing and it
is unclear if they will, he said.
   But Yokogawa Electric Company, a major electrical machinery
manufacturer, said its joint venture factory in Xian resumed
production last week following a temporary shutdown during the
unrest.
   Half of the Japanese China-based staff have returned to China and
the company hopes to send the rest back later, said Tatsuya Ando of
Yokogawa's public relations office.
   ``We have a very long history in China, and we are not
considering fundamentally rethinking our plans in China just because
of recent events,'' Ando said.

   H. Robert Heller, a member of the Federal
Reserve Board, announced today that he was resigning to become an
executive with VISA International, the giant credit card company.
   Heller cited his government salary of $82,500 as a primary reason
for his departure, saying it had represented a significant financial
sacrifice to him during his three years on the seven-member board.
   Heller said he would serve as executive vice president at VISA,
based in San Francisco, where he had lived previously. Before
joining the Fed, Heller was a senior vice president and director of
international economic research at Bank of America.
   Heller refused to disclose his exact salary at VISA, saying only
that it would be a ``pretty sizable'' increase.
   Heller's resignation will provide President Bush with the
opportunity to make his first appointment to the Fed board, which is
currently composed entirely of officials appointed by former
President Ronald Reagan.
   Heller, 49, was generally recognized as the international expert
on the board and it was considered likely that Bush would pick
someone with international economic experience to replace him.
Heller's term was scheduled to have run until Jan. 31, 1996.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with rainy weather
helping to buoy up wheat prices and depress the corn and soybean
markets.
   Rain is slowing the winter wheat harvest in the Southeast but
aiding newly planted corn and soybeans in the Midwest. Scattered
showers were expected to spread eastward from western Iowa over the
next couple days, ending about a week of dry weather in the Corn
Belt.
   Wheat prices fell early in the session on rumors of a possible
embargo on grain to China, but closed higher after U.S. officials
said they did not plan to cut off grain sales to China to protest

   But experts said recent Chinese purchases of U.S. wheat have
probably eliminated any immediate need.
   ``I think they can hold back and stay off the market for a few
months,'' said Susan Leighty, a grain-market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 3\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.99 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 2 cents lower with July at $2.65 a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to
5\ cents lower with July at $1.63 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents
lower to 2} cents higher with July at $7.39 a bushel.

   A Georgia frozen food company known mainly
for its chicken and barbecue is selling its new Japanese food in a
crowded market _ Japan.
   But the overseas competition doesn't worry R&amp;H Food Enterprises
Inc., which is exploiting it's product's cost advantages to carve a
niche in the market.
   ``It's cheaper to produce in America,'' said Don Hall, president
of Savannah-based R&amp;H Food. ``Our labor is cheaper. Our costs of
goods are cheaper. And even if you add in the shipping charges, it's
still cheaper.''
   Since Hall's company was established in 1981, it has produced
chicken and dumplings, chicken pot pies, pork barbecue and such
frozen rice dishes such as seafood and catfish gumbos.
   In 1987, R&amp;H joined Nitto Food Products Ltd., a leading Japanese
food manufacturer, and Nozaki America Inc., a Japanese trading
company, in forming Georgia Pro Foods Inc.
   Nitto sent Hideo Saga, a consultant for a Japanese company with
which R&amp;H markets the U.S.-made frozen dinners, to Savannah to
develop test products, including ``beef-rice,'' a popular Japanese
dish of rice, beef and vegetables.
   Hall's 50 employees ship 80,000 pounds of cooked beef a month to
Japan, the maximum allowed under a government-set quota. The beef,
cooked and packed in six-pound pouches, is used in various Nitto
products.
   Pro Foods also ships 40,000 pounds of frozen beef-rice a month,
packed in plastic pouches that can be heated in boiling water or
microwave ovens.
   To assure the authenticity of the dish, the rice is steamed in a
Japanese rice cooker resembling a large safe, complete with a wheel
to bolt it shut. Another Japanese machine keeps the beef slices to a
thickness of between 1.5 and 2.5 millimeters, a tolerance specified
by Nitto.
   A third Japanese machine known as a nitrogen tunnel cools the
beef-rice pouches to minus-10 degrees Fahrenheit. The blast of
nitrogen keeps the rice from clumping when heated and served.
   ``We send it to small restaurants and cafeterias. The people in
the back know it was made in Savannah, Ga., but not the customers,''
said Saga.
   Saga, who spent six years developing frozen and canned foods in
Nitto's Yamagata headquarters, has been assigned permanently to
Savannah. He is one of two Japanese quality control consultants at
Pro Foods. Nitto sends a new assistant every three months.
   Japanese consumers eat rice about three times a day, but have to
pay about five times more than their American counterparts, said
Saga. To protect growers, the Japanese government bars imports of
cheaper foreign rice but permits foods containing rice.
   Beef, the second-most popular meat in Japan after fish, must be
imported because the Japanese cannot produce enough to meet demand,
said Hall. As a result, the wholesale price of beef is $8 to $12 a
pound in Japan, compared to about $3.50 a pound for prime filet
mignon at American grocery stores, he said.
   Saga is developing additional products for Pro Foods to export.
His countrymen like Italian food, but probably would not enjoy chili
and tacos, he said.
   Saga also doesn't see a future for Hall's catfish gumbo, because
in Japanese mythology catfish are thought to cause earthquakes.
   ``There are many catfish in Japan, but they are never eaten,''
Saga said.
   Hall believes there are many untapped opportunities for small
companies such as R&amp;H that want to sell to the Japanese. But the
firms will have to supply products that meet their needs and
specifications.
   ``The future is in small ventures,'' Hall said. ``There are 124
million Japanese living in an area the size of California. They all
eat, they all sleep and they all drink ... The items that can be
manufactured here to Japanese specifications are just unlimited.''

   The stock market retreated today in the face of a
declining dollar and rising interest rates.
   The dollar fell this afternoon against leading foreign
currencies. And prices of long-term government bonds dropped about
$5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the
8.33 percent-8.35 percent range.
   Many Wall Streeters lately have speculated that stock prices
might be due for a pause or pullback after their strong advance
since late last year.
   Analysts said a Fed report on economic conditions around the
country helped ease market concern that the central bank might need
to drive interest rates higher but didn't inspire stock-buying
enthusiasm.
   The report, known as the ``beige book,'' indicated that growth is
slowing and inflationary pressures have eased in response to an
anti-inflation campaign waged by the Fed.

<HEAD>Robins, American Home Move Back Deadline for Buy Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Robins Co. and American Home Products Corp.
announced Wednesday that they have moved back to Dec. 31 the
deadline for American Home Products to buy the Richmond-based
pharmaceutical company.
   Under the orginal purchase agreement, American Home Products
could terminate the purchase and withdraw from the Chapter 11
reorganization of Robins if all appeals of the plan were not cleared
up by July 26. American Home Products is purchasing Robins through a
$700 million stock swap.
   Last week, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond
affirmed a lower court ruling approving the reorganization plan.
Part of the plan includes a $2.5 billion trust fund to pay off the
claims of nearly 200,000 women who claimed physical injury from the
use of the Robins' Dalkon Shield intrauterine birth control device.
   Both American Home Products chairman John R. Stafford and E.
Claiborne Robins Jr., president and chief executive officer of the
pharmaceutical company, said the extension of the termination date
would allow sufficient time for any appeals of the appeals court
decision.
   ``We would like to get on with the completion of our acquisition
of A.H. Robins,'' Stafford said. ``We believe doing so promptly
would be in the best interests of all concerned. If no appeals of
the orders... are taken to the Supreme Court, our present
anticipation is that the transaction will be complete early in the
fourth quarter of this year.''
   Robins sought federal bankruptcy protection in 1985 in the wake
of mounting claims from the use of the Dalkon Shield, marketed by
the company in the mid-1970s. Women who used the IUD said they
suffered injuries ranging from internal bleeding to sterility.
   After three years of hearings, the reorganization plan was
approved by federal District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., and later
by Robins' creditors. That approval was challenged by attorneys
representing some of the claimants, who argued votes from women who
claimed the greatest injury should be given a greater weight than
other claimants.

   The dollar ended lower against all major
currencies in thin, nervous trading Wednesday following a mixed
performance overseas.
   Gold prices rose sharply in reaction to the decline. Republic
National Bank of New York said the late bid for a troy ounce of gold
was $371.25 a troy ounce, up $6.25 from Monday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started out stronger overseas
but slipped back after failing to sustain higher levels that are
important to chart-watching analysts. The decline accelerated
following reports of quiet dollar-selling intervention by the
Federal Reserve, they said.
   Ronald H. Holzer, chief dealer for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago,
said traders also were concerned that interest rates may soon rise
overseas, especially after the European parliamentary elections,
depressing the dollar's value.
   He said that feeling was underlined by remarks from West
Germany's central bank indicating dissatisfation with the recent
high dollar levels.
   Trading was particularly quiet in London, where markets were
affected by strikes on Britain's railways and London's buses and
subways. Some dealing rooms in London operated with skeleton staffs
and very little business was seen during the day.
   In London, the dollar rose against the pound. One British pound
cost $1.54675, down from $1.5553 Tuesday. Sterling fetched $1.5553
in New York, up from $1.5405.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before the European markets open,
the dollar closed at 144.95, up 1.15 yen from Tuesday. The dollar
traded slightly lower at 144.90 yen in London, and at 142.55 yen in
New York, down from 144.90.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.9610 West German marks, down from 1.9870; 1.6905
Swiss francs, down from 1.7205; 1.19325 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19875; 6.6565 French francs, down from 6.7315; and 1,423.50
Italian lire, down from 1,440.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Tuesday's late
rates: 1.9680 West German marks, down from 1.9775; 1.7005 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7110; 6.6795 French francs, down from 6.7025;
2.2375 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2255; 1,439.50 Italian lire, up
from 1.431.75; and 1.19675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2000.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $372.40 a troy ounce, up from $366.30. Gold sold
at a bid price of $366.75 a troy ounce in London, up from $366.50;
and at $366.40 an ounce in Zurich, up from $366.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $366.57 an ounce, down from
$366.95 late Tuesday.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.285 a troy ounce, up from $5.234 late
Monday. It fell to $5.28 an ounce in London from $5.34.

<HEAD>Hooker Selling Stakes in U.S. Stores; Shopping Malls to Be Sold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hooker Corp., an Australian property developer and retailing
concern, hopes it can quickly accomplish a plan to sell stakes in
its American stores and sell shopping malls it owns in the United
States, a Hooker executive said Wednesday.
   J. Frank Haasbeek, president of L.J. Hooker Corp., the
Atlanta-based holding company for Hooker's U.S. operations, said
Hooker wants to act swiftly in arranging the sales, which are aimed
at lightening the company's debt load.
   ``We would like to accomplish a lot in the next three to six
months,'' Haasbeek said in an interview.
   Hooker announced earlier this week that it is seeking joint
venture partners to invest in its Bonwit Teller department store
chain, B. Altman stores, Sakowitz and Parisian stores.
   The Merksamer Jewelers chain, which is 80 percent owned by
Hooker, has been put on the sale block by Hooker and the other
owners.
   Hooker also said it will divest its Forest Fair Mall in
Cincinnati, Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia, S.C., and Thornton
Town Center outside Denver. In addition, partners are being sought
to invest in malls Hooker plans to build in Cary, N.C., Tampa, Fla.,
and Atlanta.
   A 20-story office tower Hooker has under construction in midtown
Atlanta, called 10 Peachtree, also will be sold.
   Haasbeek declined to identify parties that have expressed
interest in investing in Hooker's department stores or buying the
shopping malls.
   He said the malls have attracted many potential purchasers and
Hooker is negotiating with a North American builder about making an
investment in the sites on which Hooker plans to construct new
shopping malls.
   Announcement of the planned sales followed word from Sydney,
Australia-based Hooker in late May that it intended to sell $750
million of holdings in the United States and Australia to raise
badly needed cash.
   Much of Hooker's financial difficulty stems from three years of
rapid expansion in U.S. retailing and real estate development, a
recent slowdown in U.S. retail sales, a sharp rise in Australian
interest rates and tightened credit.
   Since 1986, Hooker has acquired: Bonwit Teller and B. Altman,
department stores located in the Northeast and Florida; 80 percent
of Sakowitz, a small chain of department stores based in Houston; a
majority interest in Parisian, a chain operating in the South based
in Birmingham, Ala.; and 80 percent of Merksamer Jewelers, a string
of jewellery stores with headquarters in Sacramento, Calif.
   At a meeting in Sydney on Wednesday, Hooker asked about 40
creditor banks to support a four-month moratorium on principal
payments on its loans. Hooker would pay only interest during the
period.
   The lenders were asked to decide by Friday whether they would
agree to the temporary reprieve for Hooker.
   After Wednesday's meeting, Richard Grellman of the accounting
firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords, an adviser to Hooker, said there is
``a general level of support'' for the moratorium proposal among
Hooker's creditors.
   If the creditors go along with a postponement in principal
payments, Hooker will draw up a restructuring plan within three
months for approval by the lenders.
   Grellman said Hooker's directors remain in charge of running
operations and all Hooker's businesses continue to be operated as
usual.

<HEAD>John Chan, Hong Kong's Trade Minister, Fights Tidal Wave of 1997
Gloom</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Chan sipped a glass of water and briefly
closed his bloodshot, travel-weary eyes. Hong Kong's trade minister
knew the questions were coming over how the blood spilled in Beijing
would wound the freewheeling British colony that becomes part of
Communist China eight years from now.
   Chan predicted any wounds would heal, but admitted uncertainty
about what looms ahead.
   ``Those were very sad events indeed,'' Chan told reporters in New
York during a visit that followed the Chinese government's crackdown
on a pro-democracy movement. ``It is time to be humble about our
lack of knowledge about what is going on in China.''
   For the frenetic territory of free enterprise that sits like a
fragile egg along the southern Chinese frontier, the bloodletting
fractured a veneer of confidence that China will permit Hong Kong to
maintain its way of life for 50 years after the 1997 takeover, as
promised under a historic Sino-British pact.
   The June 3-4 killings and their aftermath devastated prices in
the Hong Kong stock market, weakened property values, led to record
requests for emigration visas and drained bank vaults as many
depositors spirited their money abroad, fearing more turmoil.
   Even Hong Kong optimists began to quietly question whether
Britain made a grave mistake five years ago by agreeing to surrender
the colony, a vestige of the Opium War days that has since blossomed
into one of the most fabulously successful industrial and financial
centers of Asia.
   For Chan, a 46-year-old, native-born Hong Kong Chinese who speaks
flawless British-accented English, the Beijing crackdown and its
impact on the colony have presented the greatest challenge of his
career and personal life.
   Chan must try to convince Americans and other foreigners with
billions of dollars invested in Hong Kong that their money and
property not only are safe but will grow in value in the
pre-takeover years and beyond.
   He also must try to persuade Hong Kong's 6 million people to
hope, to trust that China will honor its pledge to basically leave
them alone after the scarlet hammer &amp; sickle flag replaces Britain's
union jack on July 1, 1997, the official termination of British
authority under their joint declaration.
   ``What gives the Sino-British agreement its teeth is that it's a
binding agreement,'' Chan said during his trip earlier this month to
Washington and New York, where he expounded on the virtues of Hong
Kong's economy to lawmakers and business groups, and rejected
suggestions that the territory is doomed.
   ``China has an excellent track record of honoring its
international commitments,'' he said. ``Even in the dark days of the
Cultural Revolution, the Chinese honored their agreements. They kept
Hong Kong supplied with food and water.''
   In his view, China not only will protect Hong Kong's way of life,
but will continue exhorting its entrepreneurs to share their
expertise with the rest of the country.
   Chan is a senior native Hong Kong member of the British
administration and has been a career colonial official for the past
25 years, with posts that have ranged from government spokesman to
the governor's private secretary.
   Perhaps for that reason, Chan has no choice but to put the best
face on a potentially explosive problem and has gone out of his way
to show he wants to stay in Hong Kong, whether he really believes in
its future or not.
   He was deeply involved in the negotiations that climaxed with the
Sino-British agreement in 1984 and is a member of the Sino-British
Land Commission, a body established under the agreement to oversee
the sale and allocation of property in the years up to 1997.
   In March 1987 he became deputy chief secretary and was
responsible for formulating constitutional reforms aimed at giving
Hong Kong a democratically elected government prior to the Chinese
takeover. He became trade and industry secretary this past March.
   His responsibilities now include Hong Kong's international
trading relations and its involvement in world commercial
organizations, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Unlike his British colleagues, however, Chan does not have a
British passport or right of residence in Britain. He grew up and
went to school in Hong Kong. He lives there with his wife and two
children. He just purchased an apartment in Hong Kong and said he
does not keep any overseas bank accounts.
   ``My family and I remain committed to Hong Kong,'' he said. ``I
was born here, my father was born here.''
   Hong Kong, he said, ``is not China. It is not going to be run by
China. It will be run by Hong Kong people under the agreement.''
   Nonetheless, events in China over the past few weeks have jolted
many other Hong Kong people into concluding that the Beijing
government has no regard for international opinion when confronted
with a threat to its political supremacy. In their view, if Hong
Kong eventually is seen by the Chinese Communist Party as a
destabilizing influence on the rest of the country, it would use
whatever means necessary to fortify itself at Hong Kong's expense.
   This scenario strikes the deepest fear into the Hong Kong
government because it raises the possibility of chaos. Many Hong
Kong residents are refugees of past Chinese political convulsions
and now have no place to go. Britain has made no special
arrangements to accept them.
   For that reason, Chan and other members of Hong Kong's colonial
administration recently began to press London to reconsider its
immigration policy concerning Hong Kong residents.
   ``Britain has a moral obligation to the people of Hong Kong,''
Chan said. ``They want to acquire an insurance policy, a home of
last resort, if things really turn bad.''
   The lukewarm response of the British thus far, Chan said,
``indicates this is not an easy matter for them.''
   Chan admitted he is not a trained Sinologist and the stunning
crackdown on political dissidents in China took him by surprise.
Nonetheless, Chan said, if it had to happen, he was grateful it
happened in 1989, not 1996.
   ``One of the silver linings on this dark cloud is that it's given
Hong Kong people a hard shock _ like an injection, an immunization
against the next rude shock,'' he said.
   As for his own future under the Chinese Communist umbrella, Chan
smiled philosophically.
   ``If I do well in the next eight years,'' he said, ``maybe I'll
get a promotion.''

   The stock market gave ground for the third
straight session Wednesday, faced with a declining dollar and rising
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.97 to 2,464.91,
bringing its loss since the start of the week to 21.47 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
617 up, 842 down and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 168.83 million
shares, against 167.65 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 201.21 million shares.
   The dollar fell Wednesday afternoon against leading foreign
currencies. And prices of long-term government bonds dropped about
$5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the
8.33 percent-8.35 percent range.
   Many Wall Streeters lately have speculated that stock prices
might be due for a pause or pullback after their strong advance

   Two notable exceptions to the downtrend were American Telephone &amp;

109}.
   Activity remained brisk in airline issues, most of which have
been gaining since NWA's recent agreement to be acquired for $121 a

parks to cut debt and focus on its publishing and insurance
businesses.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $5.14 billion, or 0.16
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .31 to 179.18.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .81 to 366.56, and S&amp;P's

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
firmer on Wednesday despite further signs of weakness in sterling
and the disruption to trading caused by Britain's first national
rail strike since 1982.
   The major blue chip stocks continued their recent tendency to
drift upward in spite of negative economic news, dealers said. The
pound fell sharply overnight, though it recovered somewhat later in
the day, helped by modest intervention by the Bank of England.
   The Stock Exchange shortened the trading session about an hour
because of the chaotic traffic conditions in London as a result of
the strike.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 7.4
points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 2,172.2.
   Trading volume amounted to a slender 281.4 million shares by 1500
GMT, compared with 504.1 million shares traded by 1600 GMT on

<TEXT>
   A former New York Federal Reserve Bank board
member pleaded guilty Wednesday to illegally passing on confidential
interest rate data in the first insider trading case involving
government securities.
   In a plea agreement, Robert A. Rough, 50, pleaded guilty to a
single bank fraud charge and the government in exchange dropped two
insider trading charges and four related counts.
   Rough admitted leaking confidential data while he served as a New
York Fed board member from 1982 to 1984 to a securities firm that
made about $50 million from the information.
   As part of the plea deal, prosecutors also agreed to recommend a
prison term of under one year for the former banker. Rough faces a
maximum five years in jail and $10,000 fine. Sentencing is set for
Aug. 18.
   Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, said his client had sent
letters of apology to the New York Fed and Federal Reserve Bank in
Washington.
   ``To me, it's certainly a step in the right direction, an example
of contrition,'' Himmel said.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise called the apologies a
``good step.''
   Rough admitted giving a Livingston brokerage confidential data
about the discount rate set by the Fed in Washington. The New York
Fed and 11 sister regional banks make regular recommendations to the
Fed on the rate, which has a powerful bearing on government
securities.
   Rough sat on the New York Fed's board as president of the
National Bank of Sussex County in Branchville. He admitted leaking
recommendations as well as advance word of a change in the Fed's
discount rate.
   The allegations surfaced during the 1987 trial of a Gilbert C.
Schulman, president of the brokerage firm of Bevill, Bresler &amp;
Schulman Inc. He and three other Bevill, Bresler officials were
imprisoned for the firm's $144 million collapse in 1985.
   Rough admitted that he passed on the data to Schulman, a longtime
friend and business associate, and other principals.
   The government said the information allowed the firm to make an
estimated $50 million in profits and avoid losses. In exchange,
Rough allegedly received $47,000 in interest deferred loans.
   After the charges were disclosed, the Fed tightened its
procedures regarding the discount rate.
   Himmel said Rough's disclosures were ``not done out of any
motivation for greed or to line his pockets'' and blamed ``pumping
and prodding by Gilbert Schulman.''
   He claimed Rough probably would have received the loans from
Bevill, Bresler regardless of whether he provided the information.
   Schulman had agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of Rough.
   Himmel said Rough, a former chairman of the New Jersey Bankers
Association, admitted the facts outlined in those charges even
though he was not required to plead guilty to them.
   In pre-trial arguments, Himmel argued the discount rate data had
no inherent material value and was not comparable to information
about stocks. But Debevoise disagreed, ruling that insider trading
laws could apply to Rough's case.
   The insider trading charges would have carried a fine of $100,000
per count.

   When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
triumphantly led Iran through a revolution a decade ago, oil output
tumbled, world prices soared and shock waves hurt the U.S. economy.
But analysts say that with the spiritual leader's death earlier this
month, history won't repeat itself.
   ``It's business as usual,'' said Peter Gignoux, director of the
international energy department at Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage
in London.
   Fergus MacLeod, analyst at London's Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said,
``In the short-term, the impact will be extremely limited.''
   With the quick transfer of power to President ere
have so far been no reports of instability that would threaten the
flow of crude from one Ali Khamenei, thof the world's major producing nations.
   ``There doesn't appear to be any civil disruptions which could
unsettle the oil sector,'' said Paul Mlotok, head of energy research
at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   The 1979 revolution, which brought Khomeini to power and ended
the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was marked by unrest in the
oilfields and a sharp drop in production. World oil prices soared,
roiling the economies of the United States and other indus recently that
Iran could produce 3.5 million
barrels a day without any problem.
   ``We want to keep onshore and offshore production capacity for
the next five years at a level of 4 million barrels a day,'' he said.
   Repairing its damaged industry would boost the slumping economy.
   Iran earned an estimated $9 billion last year from oil revenues,
compared with $23.6 billion in 1977.
   With increased production and higher prices, 1989 earnings should
climb to about $12 billion, analysts predict.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices rose Wednesday, led by a
rally in the heating oil market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July heating oil
contract jumped 2.29 cents to finish at 47.98 cents a gallon, while
the August contract closed 2 cents higher at 48.07 cents a gallon.
All other contracts posted healthy advances.
   Crude prices also made strong gains. The August contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 43
cents to close at $19.31 a barrel. Contracts for later delivery
showed similar increases.
   Among other refined oil products, meanwhile, unleaded gasoline
for July fell 0.7 cent to 59.10 cents a gallon, but other contracts
rose.
   Analysts said crude and heating oil prices got a strong boost
from weekly American Petroleum Institute statistics that showed a
sharp decline in stocks from last year's levels.
   Crude oil inventories plunged by 25.2 million barrels from 1988
and were off 1.2 million barrels for the week ended June 16, the API
said.
   Heating oil stocks fell 11.5 million barrels from last year and
1.6 million barrels for the week, according to the API report
released after the close of trading on Tuesday.
   ``After the APIs came out and people saw that heating oil was
running so far below last year, those who had been cutting back
started to look at buying it again,'' said Jack Unger, oil broker
with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Unleaded gasoline stocks, meanwhile, rose by about 63,000 barrels
last week and by 819,000 barrels from 1988 levels.

<HEAD>Heller Resignation Sparks Rally In Precious Metals Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The resignation of Federal Reserve Board member H. Robert Heller
sparked strong rallies in the gold, silver and platinum markets
Wednesday amid uncertainty about his departure's impact on interest
rates and inflation.
   On other markets, copper futures plummeted, cotton and heating
oil surged, pork bellies plunged, and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures prices rose $6.10 to $6.90 on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in August at $375.70 a troy
ounce; silver settled 4.7 cents to 5.1 cents higher with July at
$5.298 a troy ounce.
   Platinum finished $6.90 to $7.70 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with July at $501.80 a troy ounce, the
contract's first close above $500 since June 8.
   The news that Heller was leaving the Fed to join the credit-card
company Visa International triggered heavy buying during the last 10
minutes of trading on all the precious-metals markets, which benefit
from inflation worries.
   The Federal Reserve's attempts to fight inflation by raising
interest rates have generally been seen as effective. The propects
of a change in the board's composition sent a buying panic through
the precious-metals markets, which were already trading higher in
reaction to a continued weakening of the dollar's value against
other major currencies.
   Heller's resignation, while not likely to change the Fed's
course, adds to the murkiness of recent economic indicators.
   ``There are a lot of cross-currents out there and people are very
uncertain about what is being said by the markets,'' said Sharon
Ziemian, a precious-metals analyst with Citibank in New York.
   Analyst Nina Lipton of the Platinum Guild International, a
platinum trade association, said platinum's close above $500 an
ounce signaled ``a real turning point'' for all the precious metals,
which had been trending lower since late last year.
   But Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago saw no
such signs in the gold market.
   ``The market is not showing any sort of independent strength,''
he said.
   Copper futures plummeted on the Commodity Exchange following news
that the Canadian copper refiner Noranda Minerals had reached a new
labor agreement with workers.
   Major U.S. copper producers are also negotiating new labor
contracts, and the Noranda settlement might portend easier going for
those talks, Platt said.
   Copper settled 6.2 cents to 8 cents lower with June at $1.077 a
pound.
   Some cotton futures soared the 2 cents-a-pound daily limit on the
New York Cotton Exchange amid fears that persistent rain in the
Southeast was hampering planting and care of the crop.
   Cotton settled .93 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 68.80
cents a pound.
   Heating oil futures skyrocketed on the New York Merc, partly on a
weekly American Petroleum Institute report that showed U.S. stocks
of petroleum distillates had dropped by 1.6 million barrels last
week.
   Heating oil settled 1.83 cents to 2.29 cents higher with July at
47.98 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 39 cents
to 45 cents higher with August at $19.31 a barrel; unleaded gasoline
was .07 cent lower to 1.06 cents higher with July at 59.10 cents a
gallon.
   Frozen pork belly futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in line with weaker cash prices, which helped to drag down
the related livestock markets.
   Frozen pork bellies settled .60 cent to .98 cent lower with July
at 33.52 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower to .17 cent higher
with July at 49.07 cents a pound; live cattle were .20 cent to .60
cent lower with August at 70.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.42 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 81 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade, with rainy weather helping to support wheat prices
and depress the corn and soybean markets.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 3{ cents higher with July at $3.99\ a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with July at $2.65{ a
bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5\ cents lower with July at $1.63 a
bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with July at

   The champagne and string quartet are gone from
the busy terminal at LaGuardia Airport, and even Donald Trump can't
master the weather to make the flights run on time for his newly
acquired Northeast shuttle airline.
   But passengers say they like the service and the Trump Shuttle
meets their needs as business travelers _ for them, the frills are
secondary.
   The billionaire developer launched his new airline two weeks ago
with a blitz of trademark Trump glitz, soon after a federal
bankruptcy judge approved his $365 million purchase of the New
York-Washington-Boston shuttle from strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   Pan Am Corp., which operates a rival shuttle and gained a big
chunk of business from Eastern, concedes that curiosity about
Trump's new service has robbed it of some passengers _ at least for
a while.
   Pan Am's share of the shuttle market ``has definitely come down,
as we expected,'' said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon. That share
was around 75 percent two weeks ago but has slipped since Trump's
startup to 65 percent to 70 percent, she estimated.
   But Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles claims a bigger share
for the new service, around 45 percent to 55 percent.
   ``I'm very pleased with the way the operation is running,'' he
said Wednesday. Nobles added that he has been disappointed by the
recent run of unseasonably stormy weather in the Northeast, which
has caused many delays and cancellations.
   On Wednesday, the Trump Shuttle terminal at New York's LaGuardia
Airport was back to normal. The red and white balloons,
Mozart-playing string quartet and buffet tables laden with champagne
and finger food present for its inaugural day were gone, although
new fresh plants and big red T's remained as permanent touches.
   Thunderstorms in the Northeast snarled the shuttle's hourly
schedule and shattered Trump's advertised claim for getting the
flights off precisely on time. The red neon advisory warned of
runway delays of up to 90 minutes.
   Passengers on the 7 a.m. EDT flight from Washington's National
Airport to LaGuardia didn't arrive until 10:40 a.m., after a detour
to Albany, N.Y., for refueling. Some of the travelers arriving at
LaGuardia were exasperated but conceded that the weather is beyond
even Trump's control.
   ``I don't know how Eastern would have handled it,'' said a young
woman traveling on business to Mt. Kisco, N.Y.
   On Tuesday, with good weather, flights were running closer to
schedule although still not always exactly on the hour as promised
by Trump.
   The 7:40 a.m. New York-to-Washington run left only five minutes
late and arrived 10 minutes early, while the 5 p.m. Washington-New
York flight left only a few minutes late and arrived on time at 6
p.m.
   ``The service was fine; it's like any other airline,'' one young
businessman said Wednesday. ``It didn't seem any different to me. It
got me here, that's the main thing.''
   Trump has promised his shuttle will be a ``diamond'' service, but
a number of passengers indicated they cared more about
transportation than about Trump's planned refurbishing of the jets
in burgundy and saddle-brown tones with chrome and maple wood veneer
accents.
   On the outside, only four of Trump Shuttle's fleet of 21 Boeing
727s have been repainted in the new color scheme: white fuselage
with red, black and gold stripes, the word ``Trump'' above the
stripes and a red `T' on the tail. Except for a ``Trump'' hastily
painted in red on the rest of the planes, they still sport the
familiar Eastern silver and blue.
   The food is pretty much the same, too. On a recent morning flight
the offering was a bagel, a dollop of cream cheese, a few grapes, a
strawberry, half-frozen orange juice that had to be eaten with a
spoon and coffee served in paper cups.
   Evening fare consisted of three pieces of barbecued chicken
breast, corn-tomato salad and a slice of rye bread in a plastic box,
along with free beer, wine and soft drinks.
   Most of the 1,000 or so Trump employees were formerly with
Eastern, and many of them are enthusiastic and visibly happy to be
working again after more than three months on the picket line.
   ``It's a world of difference,'' said first officer Bill Bowen, an
18-year Eastern pilot, comparing the two airlines. ``Better working
conditions, more flexible management.''
   A young woman selling tickets at LaGuardia, also a former Eastern
employee, said, ``Donald Trump is a perfectionist. And now we get
our paychecks on time!''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government locked the doors of the Guardian
Bank of Hempstead Wednesday morning and federal investigators said
they would seek evidence of criminal behavior in the bank's failure.
   While FBI agents executed search warrants to look for evidence of
fraud, 80 staffers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. began
the work of liquidating the bank and preparing checks for federally
insured depositors, federal authorities said.
   In a related action, the Government National Mortgage Association
ousted New York Guardian Mortgagee Corp. from GNMA's program of
mortgage-backed securities.
   Louis Gasper, executive vice president of GNMA, said his agency
declared the New York Guardian in default and took over its
multibillion-dollar portfolio because investors were not being fully
paid.
   Gasper said beginning next month investors will be paid in full
and on time and those shortchanged in the past would be reimbursed.
   ``We believe there will be substantial losses that the government
will have to make up here and we will do so promptly,'' he said.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said investigators obtained search
warrants based on allegations of self-dealing and misuse of bank
resources. They cited transactions made by Louis B. Bernstein,
president of New York Guardian and the largest shareholder of
Guardian Bank.
   Maloney said that among the allegations was that Bernstein was
involved in a sham divestiture in which $5.4 million was improperly
transferred from New York Guardian to Mebco Bank of Geneva. The
Swiss bank than lent $5 million to LBB Co., a company owned by
Bernstein, and LBB bought New York Guardian and another Guardian
Bank subsidiary, Guardian Diversified Services Inc., for $1 million.
   Alan Whitney, spokesman for the FDIC, said an announcement would
be made in a few days about when checks covering insured deposits
would be issued to the bank's 12,000 depositors.
   All deposits are insured by the government up to $100,000.
Customers with accounts of more than $100,000 will receive $100,000
and a certificate for the balance that represents a claim against
whatever assets remain after the bank liquidation, Whitney said.
   The bank was declared insolvent by Dean S. Marriott, senior
deputy comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
   Guardian Bank came under the scrutiny of the comptroller's office
in 1984 because of what the government described as deteriorating
asset quality, poor earnings and declining capital.
   Despite prodding to correct the problems, the losses continued
and the bank went under with assets of $420 million and deposits of
$390 million, Maloney said.
   Guardian Bank was founded in 1973 as Vanguard National Bank, a
minority-owned company. Other stockholders took control in a proxy
fight in 1976 and in 1979 Bernstein bought the bank, merged it with
his mortgage company and changed its name.

   Shareholders of SmithKline Beckman Corp. will

shareholders of its proposed merger partner, Britain's Beecham Group
PLC.
   SmithKline also announced Wednesday it has received permission
from the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to distribute

   Stockholders of Beecham, which produces health-care and
personal-care products, approved the merger Tuesday.
   Officials of the two companies agreed in April to combine into
the world's second-largest producer of prescription medicines and
over-the-counter remedies.
   If SmithKline shareholders approve, the merger is expected to

   The proposed merger of SmithKline and Beecham would be carried
out through an exchange of stock and a spinoff of several
non-pharmaceutical companies to create a new company, SmithKline
Beecham, with headquarters in London and offices in Philadelphia.
   Based on 1988 sales, the new company would have annual revenues
of about $6.7 billion.

   The leader of a United Auto Workers union
dissident group lost a bid Wednesday to stay on the union's
International Executive Board, and the man who defeated him said the
dissident movement is dying.
   Jerry Tucker, director of the St. Louis-based UAW Region 5, lost
a re-election bid to Roy Wyse, a member of Local 249 in Kansas City,
Mo. In sometimes-noisy regional caucus balloting, Wyse received
438.351 votes and Tucker got 233.627.
   Tucker, who became a regional director last year in a federally
supervised election, said he had not decided whether to go to court
to challenge the convention delegate elections that led to
Wednesday's vote.
   Wyse said delegates from the eight-state region ``saw through the
New Directions movement. They saw they had questions but no answers.
   ``I think it's the beginning of the end for the New Directions
movement.''
   The blow was the latest Tucker's forces have received at the
convention, which concluded Friday. Delegates rejected three New
Directions-backed resolutions; at no time did New Directions get
more than an estimated 20 percent in the show-of-hands votes.
   UAW President Owen Bieber, who ran the Region 5 caucus and the
Tucker-Wyse election, said afterward that he was happy with the
results.
   There was a possibility that New Directions forces could attempt
from the convention floor Thursday to have the delegate elections
set aside.
   Earlier Wednesday, Bieber and his slate of national candidates
were declared elected to lead the 1 million-member union after no
other candidates were nominated. The election showed endorsement of
the policies Bieber has charted since becoming UAW president in 1983.
   The election came during the fourth day of the union's weeklong
triennial constitutional convention. The Anaheim Convention Center
was festooned with balloons, signs and UAW members sporting buttons,
hats and jackets emblazoned with their candidates' names.
   Tucker's movement has been pressing Bieber and the Administration
Caucus he leads to dump recently enacted joint labor-management
agreements. It's the most serious challenge to union leadership in
40 years since the early days of Walter Reuther's 24-year tenure as
UAW president.
   ``This group was perhaps better organized than (dissident) groups
of the past,'' Bieber said during an impromptu news conference
Wednesday.
   But Bieber said he expected the UAW to emerge united from the
convention. ``There has always been ample room to debate the
issues,'' he said.
   Joining Bieber in the union's leadership ranks as vice presidents
were incumbents Stephen Yokich and Odessa Kommer. The delegates
elected two new vice presidents: Stan Marshall, director of UAW
Region 1C in Flint, Mich., and Ernie Lofton, director of Region 1A
in a part of metropolitan Detroit.
   The delegates also re-elected UAW Secretary-Treasurer Bill
Casstevens.
   Each officer will serve a three-year term. None of the candidates
faced any opposition.
   Incumbent vice presidents Donald Ephlin and Marc Stepp are
retiring.
   Bieber also will assign the vice presidents to head the union's
various departments, including one for each of the Big Three
automakers and another with administrative responsibility for
agricultural implement and aerospace workers covered by the union.
   Yokich was expected to succeed Ephlin as the head of the General
Motors Department, the union's largest; Lofton to follow Yokich at
the Ford Department; and Marshall to succeed Stepp as head of the
Chrysler Department.
   Kommer, the union's most senior vice president, will remain in
charge of a variety of smaller departments.
   After the nominations of Bieber and Casstevens, delegates staged
an hour-long demonstration in which they paraded across the dais,
shaking hands with the two leaders.

<HEAD>Time's Cable Unit Says Local Officials Clamor Against Paramount Cable
Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Time, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc.'s cable television arm said Wednesday
that local opposition is growing to Paramount Communications Inc.'s
plans for acquiring Time's cable franchises as part of its hostile
$10.7 billion offer for the media giant.
   American Television and Communications Corp., which is 82 percent
owned by Time, has said Paramount's acquisition of Time would be
illegal because the change in control would place ATC in violation
of many of its cable franchise agreements.
   It said officials from the states of Kansas and Hawaii and 16
cities, including Denver and Charlotte, N.C., have complained to
federal officials that Paramount's takeover plan would abrogate the
local right of prior approval for cable franchise ownership in their
areas.
   ATC said Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut III, for instance,
told the Federal Communications Commission in a letter that the
Paramount's takeover plan ``is fundamentally at odds'' with ATC's
franchise and local laws as well as federal laws on cable regulation.
   It said Emanuel Cleaver II, the mayor pro tem of Kansas City,
told the FCC in another letter, ``This intended action by Paramount
unquestionably will violate the express terms of our cable
television franchise.''
   ATC also said that Paramount has indicated in a court filing in
Connecticut, where ATC is based, that it will be unable to meet the
July 5 deadline it set in its $175-a-share tender offer for Time.
   Time had said in rejecting Paramount's offer last week that the
bid was highly conditional and subject to delays.
   Asked for a response, Paramount said it intends to extend the

to get cable franchise approval ``where required by state and local
law in an orderly and expeditious way.''

<HEAD>Kentucky Fried Chicken To Install Computers for `Smart Kitchens'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf to add that KFC is a division of Pepsico.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

   Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. announced its latest
recipe Wednesday in the fast-food competition: a ``smart kitchen''
built on personal computers from NCR Corp. and software from
Microsoft Corp.
   ``Kentucky Fried Chicken will not only be able to say, `We do
chicken right,' it will also be able to say `We do it
intelligently,''' said Tom Mays, head of NCR's personal computer
division.
   The $19.5 million system will use Microsoft's OS-2 software to
control data in virtually every operation of the 1,262 company-owned
stores, from the front counter and kitchen to inventory and sales.
   The system will also be offered to franchise holders who run
another 3,600 Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets.
   The first three installations in the $19.5 million contract will
be this summer in Louisville, with complete ``rollout'' to all
stores expected in early 1991, said Monte Jones, KFC's vice
president of information resources.
   As a management tool, the ``smart kitchen'' eliminates much of
the guesswork involved in the $5 billion annual sales based on
pressure-cooked fried chicken with ``11 secret herbs and spices.''
   Ultimately, the computer system will keep a minute-by-minute
record of sales, employee hours, a running inventory of all
supplies, and a 10-week sales history, among other things.
   It will also track the supply of cooked chicken and side dishes
on hand, tell management when to cook more and when to discard food
that is past its prime.
   For customers, the computerization will cut time spent in line
about 3 percent and make it easier to change orders, said the
company, a division of Pepsico Inc.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops, Share Prices Advance Moderately in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar dropped sharply in early trading
against the Japanese yen Thursday, while stock prices advanced
moderately.
   The dollar opened at 141.75 yen, a drop of 3.20 yen from
Wednesday's close of 144.95 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's decline followed sharp reteats in New
York overnight and in the Sydney market, which opened earlier than
the Tokyo market. The currency closed at 142.75 yen Wednesday in New
York, down from 144.75 yen Tuesday.
   Naoto Kawamura, a senior dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the
dollar came under selling pressure after investors watched the
currency fall on overseas markets. But, he added, the early trading
volume was not large.
   In New York, the dollar fell in the face of dollar-selling by
institutional investors and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
dealers said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which gained 111.81 points Wednesday, added another 74.60 points, or
0.22 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 33,419.88
points.

<HEAD>Aquitaine Extends Pennwalt Offer For Third Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elf Aquitaine Inc., which has agreed to buy
Pennwalt Corp. for more than $1 billion, extended its offer of $132
per share for two weeks Wednesday.
   The extension was the third, with Aquitaine in each case saying
more time was needed to comply with the Federal Trade Commission's
request for information and documents about the deal.
   The French government-controlled oil and chemical company said in
a news release it expects to submit all the documents to the FTC by
next week.
   As of noontime Wednesday, Aquitaine had acquired at least 4.31
million shares of the U.S. chemical company. At the time the deal
was announced, Pennwalt had about 8 million common shares
outstanding.
   The deadline, which had been set for Friday, was extended to 5
p.m. July 7.
   Pennwalt agreed to the purchase March 20 to thwart a hostile
takeover attempt by Centaur Partners. Three days after the agreement
was announced, Centaur ended its $110-per-share offer for the
company.
   Pennwalt's stock closed up $1.37{ on the New York Stock Exchange
on Wednesday at $128.75. The extension was announced after the
market closed.
