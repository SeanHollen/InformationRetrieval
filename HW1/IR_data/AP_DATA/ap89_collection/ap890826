   Hurricane Erin continued its northward trek into
cooler mid-Atlantic waters Friday with winds falling to 85 mph and
forecasters predicting a gradual weakening over the weekend.
   ``It's only a threat to marine interests,'' said National
Hurricane Center forecaster Todd Kimberlain. ``Our forecast track is
between Greenland and Ireland.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Erin's center was near 43.0 north latitude and
35.4 west longitude, or about 310 miles west-northwest of the
westernmost Azores. The system was moving northeast at about 25 mph
and was expected to weaken gradually over the next 24 hours.
   The storm will probably lose its tropical characteristics over
the North Atlantic, but that doesn't mean it will be harmless,
Kimberlain said.
   The storm will probably lose what forecasters call its tropical
characteristics over the North Atlantic, but that doesn't mean it
will be harmless, Kimberlain said. A similar storm lashed Great
Britain two years ago, causing substantial damage.
   Erin became a named storm Sunday night when sustained winds
reached 39 mph. It reached the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane
Tuesday.
   There have been seven tropical depressions in the 1989 Atlantic
hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Erin is the
fifth named storm and the third hurricane of the year.

<HEAD>`Starksy And Hutch' Star's Family Infected With AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife and son of ``Starsky and Hutch'' star
Paul Michael Glaser are infected with the virus which causes AIDS,
and the couple's daughter has already died from the disease.
   Although Elizabeth Glaser and her 5-year-old son have not
developed AIDS, the couple's first child, daughter Ariel, died of
AIDS complications last year at age 7. Glaser, the former star of
the cop show ``Starsky and Hutch,'' is the only family member not
infected.
   ``Lesser men would have walked,'' said Mrs. Glaser, who has taken
the anti-AIDS drug AZT for the past 18 months. ``He never made us
feel we were anything but a family.''
   Glaser said the family had no choice. ``We have grown up a hell
of a lot. It was either grow up or perish,'' he said.
   The Glasers have strived to keep their family life as normal as
possible, but they anticipate that will change, they told the Los
Angeles Times in a story in Friday's editions.
   They said they decided to go public with their pain after they
learned the National Enquirer was planning a story on them. The
tabloid declined to comment.
   ``We begged them not to run the story but they said it was
newsworthy,'' said Glaser, who is now a film director.
   ``Our fear is the greatest for our son,'' Mrs. Glaser said. ``It
is our right to tell him when he is strong enough and old enough to
handle the information. Now, we may not have that choice.''
   Glaser, who played the streetwise plainclothes detective Dave
Starsky in the police action series that ran from September 1975 to
August 1979, acknowledged it is not easy for him to talk about the
tragedy he faces.
   ``This has to be a story about how we rise above our fears, how
we all have to be stronger than we ever thought we could be,'' he
said.
   Glaser's former co-star David Soul said he had been unaware of
the family's situation and encouraged the public to support the
Glasers by helping to fight the deadly disease.
   ``I have been deeply saddened to learn of the events of these
past several years and of the profound loss which Paul and Elizabeth
have suffered,'' Soul said. ``But I am also inspired by the strength
of their commitment to each other and to their children.''
   The family's nightmare began in 1981 when Mrs. Glaser contracted
HIV after receiving seven pints of blood.
   She had been rushed to a hospital for the transfusions when she
began hemorrhaging in her ninth month of carrying Ariel.
   Four years later, her daughter was hospitalized with a stubborn
illness. Tests confirmed it was AIDS.
   The Glasers said Ariel contracted the virus from her mother
through eight months of breastfeeding. The boy contracted it in the
womb.
   After her daughter's death last year, Mrs. Glaser, former exhibit
director for the local Children's Museum, turned much of her
attention to raising money for pediatric AIDS research. She has
collected more than $5 million.
   Her efforts have drawn the support of many celebrities and
politicians including former President Ronald Reagan and his wife,
Nancy.
   Her story also moved Kitty Dukakis, the wife of the former
Democratic presidential candidate, Michael.
   ``Nobody in that short of time has touched me so,'' said Mrs.
Dukakis. ``I have never been with anybody who could rise above their
own pain to help so many other people.''
   As of Aug. 1, AIDS had been diagnosed in 102,621 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 59,391, have died, according to the National
Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to have recovered from
AIDS.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus, which damages the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and
cancer.
   It is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared
by drug abusers, transfusions of infected blood or blood products,
or from an infected mother to her baby before or during birth.
   However, screening procedures not available when Mrs. Glaser had
her transfusions have greatly reduced the risk of acquiring the
virus through tainted blood.

<HEAD>Abbreviated Test Flight Blamed On Defective Part</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The second test flight of
the B-2 stealth bomber was scrubbed in midflight because of a crack
in a part provided by a defense contractor once fined for billing
fraud, Air Force officials said.
   A hairline crack in a casing of an accessory drive, which powers
the $530 million high-tech jet's generators and controls, caused oil
pressure to drop during the Aug. 16 test flight, Air Force Capt.
Tess Taft said Thursday.
   ``It wasn't anything critical that would have caused the plane to
crash,'' she said. ``It was a minor problem.''
   The flight of the bat-wing bomber designed to pass through enemy
radar undetected was scheduled to last up to four hours, but was
halted after about one hour.
   The casing for the aircraft's No. 1 accessory drive was made by
Sundstrand Aviation of Rockford, Ill., which Pentagon officials
indefinitely suspended last year from doing business with the
government.
   Sundstrand was fined $115 million in October for overcharging the
government for parts, billing the Pentagon for baby-sitting costs,
country club dues and executive servants.
   The suspension did not affect contracts the company already had,
including the one for the B-2 casings.
   Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernon said he would not comment on
the flaw.
   The part was redesigned to make it thicker after laboratory tests
indicated the casing would work better if strengthened, Ms. Taft
said.
   ``There's absolutely nothing wrong with the part as originally
designed,'' she said. ``Things break, OK?''
   Officials for Northrop Corp., which builds the B-2, said the
thinner casings, measuring four feet long, one foot wide and five
inches thick, were examined and cleared as airworthy.
   ``We wouldn't put anything in there that we thought was
potentially defective,'' said Northrop's B-2 spokesman Tony Cantafio.
   Air Force engineers continue to work with designers from
Northrop, Sundstrand and other subcontractors throughout the B-2
construction process and were fully aware of the modifications made
to thicken the casing, Ms. Taft said.
   Cantafio and Ms. Taft both said they were unaware of any plan to
replace the thinner parts before the B-2's next test flight.
   The government has spent about $22.4 billion in the B-2 program,
which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has balked at the
thought of paying more than $500 million apiece for 132 bombers.
   Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, Northrop and the Pentagon last
month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes.
   The Pentagon wants $4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming
fiscal year, and it may need $8 billion in each of the three years
of peak production, 1992 to 1994.

<HEAD>Court Rules Boston Can Close Five Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court ruled Friday that five Boston
public schools at the heart of a fierce dispute over budget-cutting
can be closed.
   Schools Superintendent Laval Wilson said the five schools will be
closed as planned and affected parents will receive new school
assignments for their children.
   On July 25, the city's school committee voted to close the
schools to meet Mayor Raymond Flynn's $362 million target budget and
to ease a projected $2.6 million deficit going into the school year.
   The three-judge Appeals Court panel ruled that the school
committee's vote was valid, even though it erred when a required
public hearing was delayed until Aug. 7.
   Parents who had fought the closings said they did not expect to
appeal Friday's decision, which overturned a Suffolk Superior Judge
David M. Roseman's decision Tuesday to block the closing plan.
   School Committee member Rob Cappucci said he preferred saving
money by closing the schools rather than putting special programs
like athletics ``on the chopping block.''
   ``I would rather close buildings than programs,'' said Cappucci.
   Wilson said the committee has made $3 million in administrative
staff cuts.

   Florida's second sweep of drug users and dealers
netted more than 1,400 arrests by Friday evening as authorities
combined reverse sting and ``Trojan Horse'' operations with search
warrants and highway surveillance.
   ``I think the idea is to just get as much crack off the street as
we can, and to once again send a message to people that are buying
and selling crack that it's not going to be tolerated,'' said Jim
Liljedal, spokesman for the Broward County Sheriff's office.
   By 11:00 p.m. Friday, the roundup produced 6,683 crack cocaine
rocks, 2.6 pounds of cocaine powder, 10.44 pounds of marijuana, 52
firearms, 209 vehicles and $54,667 in cash.
   A total of 1,465 arrests had been made by Friday evening in the
operation, staffed by an estimated 1,200 officers in all of the
state's 67 counties.
   The 48-hour crackdown, dubbed Operation Rock Pile II, was
launched at 12:01 a.m. Thursday and was coordinated by the Florida
Sheriffs' Association.
   A total of 2,076 arrests were made in the first Operation Rock
Pile, begun June 31. It also netted 3,510 crack cocaine rocks, 10
pounds of cocaine powder, 3 pounds of marijuana, 327 vehicles, 50
firearms and $55,107 cash.
   Crack, a derivative of cocaine, is sold in small chunks called
rocks.
   ``The only thing that surprised us intially was what seemed to be
an unsually high amount of marijuana,'' Liljedal said at the
operation's command post in Fort Lauderdale.
   In reverse stings, officers pose as drug sellers and bust
customers.
   In Trojan Horse operations, several deputies ride hidden in the
back of a truck and jump out to make arrests when the driver is
offered crack for sale by street corner dealers.
   ``Nothing seems to deter these people when they're looking for
crack or looking to sell it,'' said Liljedal.

   A 10-year-old boy pleaded innocent Friday
to adult charges of criminal homicide in the March shooting of a
7-year-old girl who was riding a snowmobile in a lot adjacent to his
home.
   Cameron Kocher was 9 years old when, police said, he loaded his
father's .35-caliber rifle, pointed it out his parent's bedroom
window and shot Jessica Ann Carr of Gilbert in the back. He has been
free on $50,000 bail.
   Cameron stood silently next to his attorney as Monroe County
Judge Ronald E. Vican, addressing the boy as ``Mr. Kocher,''
explained the charges of criminal homicide, aggravated assault and
recklessly endangerment.
   Defense attorney Charles Hansford signed documents indicating
Cameron's plea while the boy looked on, and told the judge he had
instructed the boy to stay quiet.
   Cameron stood before the judge with his arms folded, occasionally
looking at the ceiling and let out a heavy sigh as he turned to his
parents after the proceedings ended.
   Jessica was riding on the back of a snowmobile March 6 in
Kresgeville with her friend and Cameron's next-door neighbor,
Shannon Ratti, 13, when she was shot.
   Cameron was arrested two days later after police found the rifle
with a telescopic sight, a cut on the boy's forehead and blood
splattered in the room. Cameron said the rifle cut him when its
recoil jammed the scope's eyepiece into his face.
   In June, Vican refused to transfer Cameron's case to juvenile
court, saying the shooting was deliberate. Vican's decision followed
four days of testimony from psychologists hired by the Kochers and
the state.
   Vican wrote in June that all four psychotherapists who examined
Cameron agreed he did not have any mental or emotional problems at
the time of the shooting.
   The psychologists disagreed, however, on whether Cameron could
understand the proceedings and participate in his defense. The also
disagreed on whether he could form the intent to kill.
   Cameron faced a pre-arraignment shortly after his arrest in
March, when bail was set at $50,000. He has been free on bond since
then.
   Assistant District Attorney Mark Pazuhanich said in an interview
he has ruled out seeking the death penalty. He said if the boy is
convicted, punishment could range from probation in conjunction with
psychiatric treatment, to life imprisonment.
   The defense has 30 days to file pre-trial motions.

<TEXT>
   ``Why waltz when you can rock 'n' roll?''
wrote a visitor in the guest book at the medieval-style castle of
reputed cocaine trafficker Camilo Zapata Vasquez.
   The question reflects the fast-lane philosophy obviously embraced
by Colombia's wealthy drug lords, and was revealed in the public
confiscation of hundreds of their properties nationwide in an
anti-narcotics crackdown.
   The sandstone castle, ringed by formal gardens, dominates a
200-acre compound of 10 buildings, a dozen thoroughbred horses as
well as goats, ducks, dogs and even a couple of flamingos. Visible
from a nearby highway, it has long been a landmark in Chia, a suburb
13 miles north of Bogota.
   It was seized by the army this week, and shown off to reporters
on Friday.
   European and Oriential antiques filled the castle's richly
appointed rooms, lined with paintings, statues and ceramic
figurines. Beds were framed with crystal and bronze, or four
towering posters with marble bedside tables filled with electronics
to open and shut doors and control video equipment.
   A guest book provided a peek at the peculiar variety of people
who visited the estate.
   It is just one of many believed to have been owned by Zapata
Vasquez, even though he is considered a kind of second-string
smuggler, lacking the household-name stature of reputed cartel
bosses such as Pablo Escobar, Jorge Ochoa and Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha.
   The visitor who endorsed rock 'n' roll signed his message,
apparently in jest, ``M-19 power.'' M-19 is the name accorded to a
leftist guerrilla group operating in Colombia, although the
traffickers are much more closely associated with right-wing death
squads.
   Another visitor, calling himself Mad Max, wrote: ``Living by
chance, loving by choice and killing by profession.''
   An Oct. 10, 1988, visitor named Tuti wrote in a feminine hand:
``Happy birthday. Tomorrow they'll kill me and it'll be your fault.''
   Many women left their phone numbers after their signatures.
   Margarita Zapata, identified by army officials on the estate as
Zapata's sister, was much more solemn: ``May God and the Virgin
bless all of this and those who inhabit it.''
   The book also was signed by two men who identified themselves as
local police station commanders, two army lieutenants and an army
captain. Two local mayors also signed, one of them declaring, ``Few
people can truly appreciate the history of this property.''
   A group of women from several embassies, including Yugoslavia,
Uruguay, Chile, Canada and Britain signed the book, as did a tour
from a religious society.
   Next door to the estate is a religious boarding school run by
nuns.
   In a garage and sprawling servants' quarters attached to the
castle were two new Mercedes automobiles, also confiscated.
   There were also stables, where an office wall was lined with
ribbons and trophies; an indoor swimming pool and gym, tennis
courts, horse exercise trails and a modern thatch-roofed cottage of
many rooms.
   There was a chapel as well, dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi,
with stained glass windows, antique religious statues and pews for
about 30 people.
   Studiously ignoring the dozens of soldiers who guarded the place
were 10 groundskeepers who watered the well-kept lawns and acres of
gardens, trimmed the hundreds of yards of hedges and tended to the
animals.
   They gave contradicting statements about Zapata Vasquez: he never
came to stay, he came regularly, he just left a couple of weeks ago.
They all agreed on one thing: they were underpaid, receiving the
minimum legal wage _ about $80 a month.

   The hospitality extended for 40 years
by this haven for Soviet bloc refugees is being strained as more
East Europeans take advantage of reforms and emigrate to the West.
   While East Germans flooding across the Austro-Hungarian border
this summer have enjoyed heartfelt welcomes, other East European
refugees find state support withering away.
   Women in the border town of Moerbisch have spent days sorting old
clothes, cooking and giving hugs to exhausted East Germans who
stumble in after a grueling journey to freedom through the
borderland brush.
   ``You just have to help. Anyone with a sense of humanity has
to,'' said one woman, her eyes filling with tears as she surveyed
the large hall where tables were piled high with clothes and dazed
East Germans sat over sausages and bread.
   ``I remember in 1956, my husband drove down to the border day and
night with his truck to pick up the refugees,'' she said on
condition of anonymity, recalling the mass exodus of Hungarians
after Soviet tanks crushed Hungary's anti-Stalinist uprising.
   In 1968, Austria sheltered streams of Czechoslovaks after other
Warsaw Pact countries crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   And when martial law was declared in Poland in 1981, at least
35,000 Poles sought asylum here.
   Ilse Tremmel, chief organizer of Moerbisch's relief program, is
full of energy, seeing that volunteers get rest and giving a
mother's firm hug to a 17-year-old boy who left his childhood and
his parents on the other side of the East-West divide.
   ``The help has come from everywhere,'' she says. ``Private
individuals, companies, stores. Everyone is helping.''
   The East Germans spend only days in Austria before going to West
Germany.
   But thousands of Poles and Hungarians want to remain, and because
of that they feel less welcome.
   Their asylum applications now are rejected on grounds they are
not politically persecuted but seek only to improve their economic
situation.
   Refugee Peter Mojzer doesn't see the distinction. ``You can't
separate the two,'' he says. ``If the (communist) party regulates
everything, then you can't live or work freely.''
   Many Austrians believe the Hungarians and Poles sponge off the
state, receiving free room and board plus meager monthly allowances
while they wait years for applications to be processed.
   But in July and August, 3,800 Hungarians and Poles stopped
receiving the allowances and were turned out of government-rented
hotels and boarding houses.
   They came to Austria before May 1988, when the Austrian
government began rejecting most asylum applications.
   Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak, under fire from left-wingers
who argue this violates Austria's policy of sheltering all refugees,
insisted the Poles and Hungarians were informed months in advance.
But many said they were given only days' notice.
   About 800 jobs and language training for some Poles and
Hungarians was arranged to end the furor.
   But Austria, and the West in general, still faces the dilemma of
absorbing tens of thousands of East Europeans expected to cross
increasingly open borders.
   Pius Strobl, a leader of the small opposition Green-Alternative
party, noted that 10 percent of Austria's population of 7.4 million
are former refugees.
   Austria's declining population should encourage authorities to
integrate new arrivals who are anxious to work, he said.
   Two million refugees have come here since World War II ended and
613,000 remain, officials say. Last year, 16,000 applications for
asylum were submitted, double the number for 1986.
   Hungarians who refuse to return home and depend on charitable
organizations complain they are trapped in a Catch-22 situation _
needing a work permit to secure a residence permit, and a permanent
place of residence to acquire a work permit.
   ``Who can guarantee that the reforms in Hungary will continue,''
asked Ferenc Briski, who came to Austria in 1987.
   Briski's family is among several that found lodging in eastern
Burgenland province with help from the Greens and charity groups.
Some live without electricity or heating.
   Hungarian-born Wilma Csoknyai recalls when she came to Austria
after World War II and how impressed she was with the hospitality.
   ``After the war, when nobody had anything, it was apparently
easier to be a refugee,'' she said. ``Now people can't imagine how
it is to have nothing.''

   Actor Martin Sheen took his crusade to help
the homeless to Hollywood's Walk of Fame while accepting a star in
his honor there.
   ``The sidewalks of Hollywood are known all over the world as the
Walk of Fame, but many sidewalks in America could be known a the
`Walk of Shame' because of the 4 million homeless people residing on
them full time,'' Sheen said Friday.
   In his role as honorary mayor of Malibu, the 49-year-old Sheen
recently declared the wealthy beach community a sanctuary for the
homeless.
   The actor, flanked by his wife, Janet, and sons Emilio Estevez
and Charlie Sheen, asked the crowd to pray with him for 400,000

   Lech Walesa, who has led the Solidarity
movement to form the first non-Communist government in Poland since
just after World War II, forgot to tell his son his new telephone
number.
   Lech's 17-year-old son, Slawek, who has been touring the United
States with a polka band for two months, tried to call his father
Thursday but found the number no longer functioned because of
changes in the Polish phone service.
   Slawek Walesa said he didn't have his father's new number.
   The younger Walesa, who is returning to Gdansk on Monday to
finish his last year of high school, said he thought his father
would be more effective heading Solidarity than being prime minister.
   Tadeusz Mazoviecki, a longtime Solidarity activist, was selected
by Walesa to head the government and was elected by the assembly as
prime minister Thursday.
   Walesa has said he preferred to remain as Solidarity's chief
rather than taking the reins of government.

   Before he got into hard rock, The Who's Roger
Daltry worked on heavy metal _ at a metalworking factory. And Chuck
Berry may have met ``Maybellene'' when he did her hair.
   Daltry's experience as a metalworker and Berry's as a hairdresser
are some of the humble beginnings portrayed in a Labor Day weekend
broadcast of ``Cruisin' America,'' a CBS radio program featuring
disc jockey Cousin Brucie.
   Rod Stewart used to dig graves for a living, and Chubby Checker
was once a chicken plucker, CBS Radio said in a statement promoting
the program. Dave Clark (of the Dave Clark Five) may have learned
his stage acrobatics as a Hollywood stuntman.
   The Troggs were bricklayers before they wrote ``Wild Thing,'' and
Roger McGuinn of The Byrds pumped gas.
   Some of the other performers featured in the Labor Day weekend

   Prince Aya, the second son of Emperor Akihito and
Empress Michiko, has decided to marry the 22-year-old daughter of a
university professor, according to news reports today.
   The reports, quoting palace and government officials it did not
name, followed months of speculation that the prince and Kiko
Kawashima, a graduate student at Tokyo's Gakushuin University, were
making marriage plans.
   The reports were carried by the mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun
newspaper, Kyodo News Service and on the Japan Broadcasting Corp.'s
morning news.
   Prince Aya, 23, is a student of zoology at St. John's College,
Oxford, and is home in Japan for a short vacation. He is to return
to England Sept. 20.
   Aya is second in line to the throne, which his father assumed
Jan. 7 after the death of Emperor Hirohito.
   The engagement must still be approved by the 10-member Imperial
Council, headed by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Plans for Aya's marriage could be delayed because his elder
brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, has yet to settle on a bride.
Naruhito, 29, reportedly hopes to marry within the next year or so.

   A man described by police as a drug dealer
was arrested for investigation of murder in the death of Huey P.
Newton, but claimed self-defense in killing the Black Panther
founder, police said Friday.
   Tyrone Robinson, 25, of Oakland was arrested on a weapons charge
around 7 p.m. Tuesday, hours after Newton's predawn murder on a west
Oakland sidewalk, and
   Investigators believe they recovered the 9mm pistol used in
Newton's killing, police said, but ballistics tests are still
pending.
   Robinson ``considered the murder a means to advance'' in the
Black Guerrilla Family, a narcotics distribution gang, said Sgt. Dan
Mercado at a early evening news conference at the Oakland Hall of
Justice.
   ``He wanted to be a high-mucky-muck,'' Mercado said later in an
interview. ``He was a foot soldier and he wanted to be a shot
caller. He figured we already knew. We felt we had him and he new
it.''
   The Black Guerrilla Family is a prison-based gang that operates
in the state's maximum-security prisons, including San Quentin,
where Newton served time, authorities said.
   Robinson, currently on parole for a robbery conviction, admitted
to the killing early Friday and is scheduled for arraignment
Tuesday, Mercado said.
   Mercado said Newton and Robinson have known each other for two
years.
   Mercado said Newton argued with Robinson over a cocaine deal and
that Robinson then shot the 47-year-old former leader of the black
militancy movement in the 1960s.
   Robinson contended Newton pulled a gun when the two met at a
street corner in the drug-torn neighborhood, but investigators said
they found no evidence Newton had been armed.
   The killing occurred in a neighborhood where Newton, as minister
of defense for the Black Panthers, once tried to set up social
programs to help destitue blacks.
   Police said Robinson told them Newton demanded drugs and that he
refused to sell them to him. Police said the two argued for about a
minute.
   Police said Newton had ``crossed'' the Black Guerilla Family
several times in the past. Investigators believe Newton stole drugs
from the gang, including an instance earlier this summer when,
Robinson said, he was robbed by Newton of 14 crack cocaine rocks
valued at $160.
   Mercado said a man accompanying Robinson witnessed the shooting,
but police did not divulge whether the man, arrested Friday for
investigation of auto theft, backed up Robinson's claim of
self-defense.
   Police said they had located several other witnesses who disputed
Robinson's account of the killing. There have been no other arrests
in the case, Mercado said.
   Robinson was arrested Tuesday for investigation of felony
possession of a firearm about a block from the crime scene. He was
questioned about Newton's murder, but was not considered a prime
suspect until Thursday.
   Two other men were arrested at the same time on weapons
violations, but are not considered suspects in the case, Mercado
said.
   Police denied a report published Thursday that three men had been
linked to the killing, but acknowledged for the first time that the
men were arrested on weapons charges one block from where Newton was
slain about 12 hours earlier.
   Newton's slaying prompted a noontime protest march Friday that
started in the neighborhood where he was slain.
   About 40 members of Uhuru House waved banners, carried placards
with his photo and chanted, ``Who killed Huey? Don't you tell no
lie, it was the government, the government, the FBI.''
   FBI infiltration of the Black Panther Party had contributed to
its gradual disintegration as the group, founded more than 20 years
ago, drifted from operating ghetto social programs into violence and
its members were killed.
   Officials in the FBI's San Francisco office did not immediately
return a telephone message Friday afternoon.
   The protesters marched two miles to City Hall and the Alameda
County Courthouse, where supporters had chanted ``Free Huey'' during
Newton's 1968 trial for the death of an Oakland police officer.
   Marchers refused to speak to reporters, blaming them for media
accounts that included descriptions of Newton as a gangster.
   Family members continued to prepare for Newton's funeral Monday
in Oakland. Organizers expect up to 2,000 mourners, including Black
Panther co-founder Bobby Seale.
   ``This is for members of the community and Panthers and
neighborhood supporters,'' said Barbarette Newton, the victim's
sister-in-law. ``People who knew Huey in the past and present need
to express some things.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle visited NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory to congratulate Voyager scientists and
underscore his new interest in the U.S. space program.
   ``I am exceedingly delighted to be here on this very historic day
for America and America's space program,'' Quayle told a receptive
crowd of perhaps 1,000 laboratory employees.
   The crowd cheered as Quayle said that unmanned missions _ the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory's specialty _ will continue to be an important
part of the U.S. space program.
   ``We are seeing a beginning of a new era where we'll see a
recommitment to space,'' Quayle said, echoing comments he has made
in recent months as he works hard to adopt the space program as his
issue.
   Quayle's visit Friday morning followed Voyager 2's close
encounter with Neptune that capped a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile
flight that took the two Voyager spacecraft to Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1980 and 1981, and Uranus in 1986.
   Quayle, who had shown little interest in the space program before
becoming vice president, has now seized upon it as an issue he can
use to improve his political fortunes.
   ``It's a great opportunity for him, because ordinarily vice
presidents have limited duties,'' said David Beckwith, Quayle's
press secretary.
   The issue was handed to Quayle by Congress, which established the
National Space Council at the end of the Reagan administration and
designated the vice president as its head.
   Quayle is hoping to convince Congress and the public that
expenditures on space are worthwhile, even in the face of continuing
federal budget deficits.
   On July 20, the 20-year anniversary of the landing of a man on
the moon, President Bush called for the permanent settlement of
space, by first returning to the moon and then sending a manned
mission to Mars.
   Bush charged NASA and Quayle, as head of the National Space
Council, with developing a plan to carry out those goals. The plan
is supposed to be delivered to Bush in October.
   Quayle's visit to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which included a
briefing with laboratory officials and a tour of the Voyager control
center, was patterned after a successful visit last month to the
General Dynamics Space systems division is San Diego.
   Quayle gave the same stump speech in both places, contending that
space exploration furthers scientific understanding, provides jobs,
leads to new technology and inspires young people to seek careers in
science or engineering.

   Cara and Neil Murphy were excited
about getting a new baby brother, but sitting in a hospital waiting
for him to come wasn't a fun way to spend their birthday.
   A little assurance from Dad helped ease the conflict of having a
third Murphy born Aug. 22.
   ``We've always been careful about keeping the birthdays
individual,'' said the children's father, Rod Murphy. ``From now on,
it'll be three cakes at our house every August 22nd.''
   Cara turned 10 Tuesday and Neil turned 7. And Thomas Andrew
Murphy was born.
   ``I've been taking a lot of ribbing at work,'' their father said.
``They're asking me if we're going for a world record.''
   To do that, Rod and his wife, Kathy, will have to come up with
three more children born on Aug. 22.
   The Guinness Book of World Records, under the category
``Coincidental Birth Dates,'' reports that Carolyn Cummins, of
Clintwood, Va., gave birth to five children on five different Feb.
20ths from 1952 through 1966.
   Still, the odds against coming up with a triple birthday,
according to a Michigan State University statistician, are 100,000
to one.
   Thomas Andrew came three days late and weighed 9{ pounds.

   President Bush, appealing to other
nations to rally behind Colombian officials ``on the front line of
the war against drugs,'' is sending President Virgilio Barco's
government a $65 million package to combat narcotics trafficking.
   The aid announced Friday by the summer White House consists
primarily of aircraft _ mostly helicopters _ and a variety of other
equipment and supplies, but no U.S. troops.
   However, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said some U.S.
advisers would be sent to show Colombians how to use and maintain
the equipment. He said they would number fewer than ``dozens'' but
did not have a precise figure.
   ``We will provide only material support and training,'' the
vacationing president said in a statement. ``The United States has
complete confidence in the capability of the Colombian police and
military to deal with this situation.
   ``It is time for the United States and other countries of the
world to stand with President Barco during his courageous challenge
to these insidious forces that threaten the very fabric of Colombian
society.''
   Bush vowed ``to assist the Colombian officials who are on the
front line of the war against drugs.''
   Colombia has been rocked by recent drug-related violence,
including the assassination last week of the leading presidential
candidate and this week's bombings of homes and offices of
government and political leaders.
   Fitzwater said eight Huey transport helicopters would be sent to
Columbia next week, and another 12 would be sent later along with a
Blackhawk helicopter for medical evacuation.
   A U.S. Air Force C-5 transport plane brought in two Bell 212
helicopters Friday that were delivered to Colombian authorities. The
helicopters, which add to six of the same type Colombian police
already had, represent ``an immediate, tangible response of the U.S.
government to President Barco's stepped-up war on the narcotics
traffic,'' the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
   Fitzwater said the eight Hueys would be used mainly ``for
carrying troops and policemen into rural areas'' and for locating
drug activity.
   In addition, another 20 helicopters previously bought by
Colombia, and not part of the new package, will also be shipped over
the next few months, Fitzwater said.
   The package includes another $8.6 million for light aircraft, but
the type and number has yet to be determined, Fitzwater said.
   Also in the package are machine guns and other small arms,
grenade launchers, mortars, aircraft ammunition, radios, jeeps,
ambulances, field gear, anti-tank weapons, field trucks, utility
boats, 18-man ``assault boats'' that carry machine guns, medical
supplies, tools and spare parts.
   Bush's statement reiterated the administration's vow to work with
Colombian legal officials in extraditing drug traffickers wanted in
the United States.
   Fitzwater said the overall package ``represents a conclusion that
we have a responsibility and an interest in helping them to the
maximum degree possible.''
   The aircraft and supplies will help Barco ``launch a major
effort'' against the drug cartel, Fitzwater said.
   The money comes from a special foreign aid fund and is separate
from Bush's new $8 billion anti-drug program to be unveiled by the
president in a nationally televised address Sept. 5. Fitzwater said
the drug at plan will also contain additional funds for Colombia and
other Latin American countries.
   The money is also separate from a $2 million program announced
earlier in the week to help Colombia set up security for public
officials.
   Bush will meet with Cabinet members involved in drug policy and
drug-policy coordinator William Bennett here next week.
   The president is midway through a three-week vacation that runs
through Labor Day. Evangelist Billy Graham was spending the weekend
with the first family.
   Bush on Friday followed what has been his usual pattern of
athletic activities, including golf, boating and horseshoes.
   At one point, Bush ran his 28-foot speedboat, Fidelity, into a
hard submerged object _ either a rock or piece of wood _ forcing him
to abandon a morning of boating.
   However, the mishap, which damaged the housing of one of his
propellers, was quickly repaired by a local marina and Bush was back
on the water by late afternoon.

   The Food and Drug Administration is beginning
to draw up guidelines to market a female condom, which its
manufacturer says can help protect women from the AIDS virus and
other sexually transmitted diseases.
   Colin M. Pollard, an FDA member of the panel that heard testimony
on the device Friday, estimated that it will take Wisconsin
Pharmacal Co. at least 18 months to conduct the study, receive FDA
approval and market the female condom.
   ``It will take us quite a while to just get the study going,''
Mary Ann Leeper of the Jackson, Wis., company said after the
hearing. ``The results (of the hearing) are about as good as we
could expect.''
   Leeper, in a presentation at the hearing, said the female condom
is the only method that a woman can herself control to protect
against infection from the AIDS virus and from other sexually
transmitted diseases.
   ``Today, if a woman asks a man to wear the male condom and he
says no, her choices are to take the risk or to get out of bed,''
Leeper told the panel. ``A difficult decision in the heat of the
moment.''
   The device displayed by Leeper resembled a sock made of
polyurethane, a tough, clear, flexible plastic. There are soft,
flexible rings at both ends.
   Leeper said the ring at the closed end is to aid insertion. When
properly used, she said, a sheath barrier is created within the
vagina. The ring at the open end of the device remains outside and
protects the labia.
   The female condom would cost about $1.50, Leeper said, and is
designed for one use.
   Wisconsin Pharmacal proposed to market the condom solely as a
device to protect against the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases.
   But the FDA advisory panel decided that before receiving approval
such a barrier device should be tested on an unspecified number of
women for long enough to prove that it is at least as effective as
the male condom as a contraceptive.
   The panel concluded that there was no ethical way to test the
female condom for its ability to protect against disease, but that
investigating how well it prevents pregnancy would act as a
``surrogate'' test for how well it prevents disease.
   Requiring tests against disease directly is unethical, the panel
said, because it would require exposing some women to the risk of
sexually transmitted diseases.
   Proposed guidelines were revised during the hearing and panel
chairwoman Dr. Elizabeth B. Connell of Emory University in Atlanta
said the FDA staff will draw up formal regulations. Connell said the
advisory panel would meet again to consider the final guidelines,
but she said no date has been set.
   In her presentation, Leeper asked that the condom be approved for
marketing only as a disease-prevention device, and medical experts
from Johns Hopkins University, Eastern Virginia Medical School and
from private medical organizations spoke in favor of this approach.
   Leeper said the female condom, which the company is calling
WPC-333, has been successfully tested on research equipment at the
University of San Francisco and is less likely to fail than the male
condom.

   The helicopters, weapons and supplies the U.S.
military is providing Colombia will help that nation take its
anti-drug battle into the remote regions where drug traffickers hide.
   ``Our military equipment is well-suited for that purpose. It is
durable and designed to operate in rough terrain,'' Army Maj. David
Super, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday.
   While the exact numbers and types of equipment have not been
completely worked out, President Bush has decided to send some $65
million worth of material to help stem the flow of illegal drugs to
the United States and help Colombia battle drug dealers.
   No U.S. combat personnel will be sent to Colombia, officials
stressed, but a small number of U.S. advisers will train Colombians
in the use of the equipment.
   There are 112 U.S. government employees in Colombia, including 36
military personnel, the Pentagon said.
   The initial $20 million package Bush has designated for Colombia
includes some of the rough-and-tumble type of equipment that U.S.
forces used in the jungles of Vietnam, such as the eight UH-1
``Huey'' troop transport helicopters.
   The choppers, which also may be used for ground surveillance, can
be modified to carry two .50-caliber machine guns.
   ``They are fast, versatile and reliable, and can be used to great
effect to speed up transportation when the roads are bad,'' Super
said of the choppers.
   Under past Foreign Military Sales agreements, the United States
has sold Colombia Huey choppers, as well as the updated Blackhawk
version, which must be flown by Colombian pilots.
   The Colombians can put most of the transportation, communications
and small weapons to work if they carry out raids against the ranch
headquarters and cocaine processing plants scattered about that
country's rough, mountainous territory.
   Included in the first package destined for Colombia are machine
guns, mortars, ammunition, 4-wheel drive vehicles, ambulances,
communications equipment and anti-tank guns, said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The anti-tank weapons could be used to blow up entire buildings,
if necessary.
   The Colombians are also in line to get 12 more Hueys, a Blackhawk
medical evacuation helicopter, assault boats, trucks, medical
supplies and airplanes, Fitzwater said.
   Although he did not identify which type of fixed-wing aircraft
might be sent the Colombians, a good candidate would be an A-37, a
small two-person attack jet that can carry small rockets or bombs.
   The Colombians already have 18 similar aircraft in their own air
force and have pilots familiar with such a craft.
   The Blackhawk helicopter, which can be transformed into a medical
evacuation chopper, is the larger, modernized version of the older
Huey, and can carry twice the payload.
   Super noted the type of U.S. trainers that will be sent to help
will depend on the final type of equipment that is shipped to
Colombia.
   ``They may need help maintaining the equipment _ with mechanics _
or they may request training in tactics, map reading, or first aid _
any number of things that we could provide,'' Super said.

   The Library of Congress said today it has
received $135,000 to help restore fire- and water-damaged books in a
Leningrad institution where one of the worst library disasters in
history occurred.
   The gift from Reader's Digest will help experts counter the
damage at the USSR Academy of Sciences Library, whose collection of
20 million books, manuscripts and periodicals was begun in 1714 by
Peter the Great.
   Four million books were damaged or destroyed in a 19-hour fire in
February 1988.
   The Library of Congress is a leader in developing techniques to
rescue books threatened by decay or disaster.
   James H. Billington, librarian of Congress and a Russian expert,
went to Leningrad after the fire to assess the damage and arranged
for a protocol, signed by the two institutions, agreeing to preserve
damaged materials and replace destroyed books.
   Peter Waters, a Library of Congress expert on the conservation of
damaged book collections, went to Leningrad within six weeks of the
fire.
   Billington welcomed the gift, saying in a statement that it
underscored the principle that library collections ``are truly
international resources for humanity which all of us must support
whenever one of them is threatened by destruction.''
   The library said the Reader's Digest grant will finance
equipment, supplies and technical consultation to return to use many
of the 200,000 rare volumes that were frozen in an effort to arrest
deterioration after the fire.
   The Leningrad institution is one of the world's largest research
libraries, although not nearly as large as the Library of Congress,
which holds 86 million items.
   The Academy Library is a major exchange partner for most U.S.
research libraries that collect Russian and Soviet materials. Every
year, several hundred U.S. specialists in Russians affairs visit
there to do research.
   A few months after the fire, Soviet historian and cultural
activist Dmitri Likhachev said the disaster could have been
prevented if officials had heeded warnings about the dilapidated
condition of the Soviet Union's most prestigious book collections.
   He said it pained him to see how rare books and art treasures
that were spirited away by residents of Leningrad to protect them
from Nazis who occupied the city in World War II had been destroyed
through negligence.

   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank says his political
career is intact but he made a big mistake in hiring a paroled male
prostitute to do personal chores at his Washington home.
   Frank, who disclosed his homosexuality in May 1987, befriended
and employed the man four years ago after paying him for sex. The
Massachusetts Democrat fired his employee in August 1987 when he
suspected the man was selling sex from Frank's apartment.
   ``Certainly if I were a voter, I would not ask my advice on how
to rehabilitate someone,'' Frank, 49, said during a news conference
Friday at his office in this Boston suburb. ``I think I have had
much better judgment in my public life.''
   The state Republican Party called on Frank to resign, but the
congressman, up for re-election in 1990, said the incident would not
affect his political career or plans.
   ``I don't think I'm going to be heavily penalized by the voters
for being suckered by a guy I was trying to help,'' he said.
   Some of his colleagues agreed.
   House Speaker Tom Foley, a Democrat, said Frank ``has provided
outstanding service to his constituency and the nation, and I am
absolutely confident he will continue to do so long after this
matter has been forgotten.''
   The only other member of Congress to acknowledge being
homosexual, Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., easily won re-election after
being censured by the House in 1983 for an affair 10 years earlier
with a 17-year-old House page.
   After revealing his homosexuality, Frank won election to his
fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote in the state's 4th
District, which encompasses some Boston suburbs and parts of
southeastern Massachusetts.
   ``Barney Frank is on virtually everyone's list as one of the 10
ablest members of Congress,'' Studds said. ``I suspect he will
remain on that list for a very long time to come.''
   Frank's hiring of the male prostitute was first detailed in
Friday's editions of The Washington Times.
   The newspaper said the man was named Greg Davis, but Frank said
his real name is Steve Gobie. No telephone number was listed for a
Steve Gobie in Washington or its suburbs.
   Frank said he met the man in 1985, and estimated his age at 26 or
27. The congressman admitted paying for sex with the man once, but
said the relationship quickly became one of friendship.
   He said he paid Gobie to do household chores, driving and other
errands from his own money, not congressional or campaign funds. The
total compensation amounted to about $20,000 a year, including cash
and payment of lawyer and other bills.
   In an interview on WUSA-TV in Washington, D.C., a man identifying
himself as Gobie repeated charges that Frank was aware of the sexual
activities at the apartment.
   ``He knew what was taking place. He knew there were clients
coming to his house. As long as the clients weren't there when he
was there, that was no problem,'' Gobie said.
   Frank called the man's allegations that he was aware of the
activity ``absolutely untrue.''
   Alexander Tennant, executive director of the state GOP, said
Frank should resign because there are laws against patronizing
prostitutes.
   ``This is simply a question of a congressman who had the public's
trust and violated this trust by engaging in illegal activity,''
Tennant said. ``Frank revealed today that he paid for sex.''
   Frank said his only other contact with Gobie, after the firing in
August 1987, came in December of that year when Gobie called to say
he was having problems and needed help.
   At the hourlong news conference, Frank refused to answer most
questions about his sex life. But he did say the temptation to pay
for sex was ``one of the things that led me to acknowledge being
gay. ... It was one of the reasons I was vulnerable to being preyed
on.''
   He told The Associated Press that he has now been in a monogamous
relationship for about two years with ``a very sensible person and a
steadying influence.''

<HEAD>Agency Sees No Conflict in CBOT Soybean Emergency; Senator Skeptical</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: RETRANSMITTING to add budget designator.</HEAD>

   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee says a report by federal regulators raises
conflict-of-interest questions regarding the activities of Chicago
Board of Trade officials during last month's soybean emergency.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
nation's futures markets, said Friday that an initial review of the
emergency liquidation in the soybean futures market found no
examples of self-dealing.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Agriculture Committee chairman, noted
the report raised possible conflict-of-interest questions about
several of the officials who voted for the forced reduction of
holdings in July soybean futures contracts.
   ``The CFTC must question those Chicago Board of Trade directors
participating in the July soybean decision whose affiliated firms
held net short positions in the July soybean contract in house or
customer accounts,'' said Leahy, D-Vt., in a statement issued by his
office.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods
at a specified price at a certain time in the future.
   ``Credibility is paramount for exchanges in carrying out their
self-regulatory functions. The public will not tolerate self-dealing
or conflict of interest by exchange directors or insiders,'' Leahy
said.
   The Board of Trade, the world's largest commodity exchange,
issued an emergency order last month requiring traders to reduce
their holdings in soybean futures contracts.
   That decision touched off wild swings in soybean prices and
sparked sharp criticism by farm groups, and traders saw the value of
their futures holdings drop.
   Those who had sold borrowed soybean futures on speculation the
price would fall, in what's known as a short position, stood to gain
from the emergency order because it resulted in a steep drop in
soybean prices.
   The Board of Trade has said it took the action after consulting
with the CFTC, because a subsidiary of Italian grain merchant
Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.P.A., failed to voluntarily reduce its large
holdings in the July soybean market.
   CBOT officials have said the exchange was worried that soybean
supplies were insufficient for meeting large holdings of contracts
for July delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading in that
contract.
   The July 11 order requiring traders to reduce their positions in
the July soybean market to 1 million bushels was widely perceived as
a move to prevent Ferruzzi from cornering the soybean market, which
Ferruzzi has denied.
   Ferruzzi also has bitterly criticized the CBOT action.
   ``We continue to believe that is was totally unnecessary for the
board to take its emergency action,'' said David Swanson, an
executive with Ferruzzi Group, a U.S. subsidiary.
   ``The Ferruzzi Group supports Sen. Leahy's call for further
investigation by the CFTC into the matter,'' said Swanson, also
chief executive officer of Central Soya Co.
   The CFTC's preliminary report was contained in a 36-page letter
to Leahy from CFTC Chairwoman Wendy L. Gramm.
   Among the preliminary findings, the CFTC's review disclosed no
Board of Trade governing member appeared to trade for the purpose of
profiting personally, or through an affiliated company, from prior
knowledge of the July 11 order.
   ``Our position is that even though a firm held a position (in the
July soybean market) a director would not be influenced,'' said BOT
spokesman Michael Oakes.

<HEAD>Watkins Balks at Judge's Request For Testimony in Nuclear Pollution
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is balking at
a request by a federal judge that he testify on what the government
agreed to in settling a class-action lawsuit over pollution from a
nuclear weapons plant.
   Watkins didn't explicitly say he would refuse to appear in the
court of U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in Cincinnati, but
indicated he would try to avoid it.
   ``My lawyers tell me that it's not essential, that I am not bound
by law to comply with that thing,'' Watkins said in a meeting Friday
with reporters in his office.
   ``It's very difficult for me to be put in that position _ to
demand my presence under these circumstances.''
   The suit was brought by 14,000 people who live near the Fernald,
Ohio, weapons plant. The residents allege they suffered emotional
distress and diminished property values as a result of uranium dust
releases from the plant.
   They contend they still have the right to sue for contamination
cleanup costs, but the department, which owns the plant, says the
proposed settlement is intended to preclude any further suits over
cleanup.
   The plant, known as the Feed Materials Production Center, is 18
miles from Cincinnati.
   Spiegel, who must approve the proposed settlement, said Wednesday
he wanted Watkins to testify under oath on his understanding of what
the settlement entailed.
   Stanley Chesley, lawyer for the residents, said Watkins was
running the risk of being formally ordered to testify.
   ``Adm. Watkins is picking a fight with the wrong judge,'' Chesley
said.
   In a related matter, Watkins said he would present to President
Bush within two weeks a plan for restoring the nation's capability
to produce a gas needed to make nuclear warheads.
   The plan will include a recommendation that three active but
idled military reactors in South Carolina be restarted and run for
another 15 years to ensure a supply of tritium, a radioactive gas
used to boost warheads' explosive power.
   Watkins provided no details of the plan, but he has said he would
like the first of the Savannah River reactors, near Aiken, S.C., to
be operating by early next year. All three have been under repair
for more than one year, leaving the Pentagon with a diminishing
stockpile of materials for warhead production.
   Watkins also said he would tell Bush the Savannah River reactors
should not be operated beyond 2005 because of uncertainty about
aging problems.
   ``Not one of us would sign on a piece of paper that it's smart to
take those aging reactors beyond that point,'' he said. ``There are
just too many unknowns.''
   Watkins said Congress should move quickly to approve the
financing for development and construction of two new
tritium-producing reactors _ one at Savannah River and one in Idaho
_ to ensure a continued supply beyond the 1990s. The department has
said the plants can be built in 10 years for $6.8 billion.
   ``The fragility of the antique reactors at Savannah River is
going to be hanging over our heads like the Sword of Damocles until
the year 2005,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Seven Underwater Wonders of World' Are Named</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of marine experts says the ``seven
underwater wonders of the world'' could be lost without a global
effort to protect the world's oceans and seas.
   ``We're killing the oceans,'' said former astronaut Scott
Carpenter, one of a panel of experts who named the sites Friday to
focus public attention on the world's underwater environment.
   Rick Sammon, president of the sponsoring organization, CEDAM
International, said the selection was the start of an educational
campaign aimed at preserving ``the world's beautiful but very
fragile marine environment.''
   ``If a concerted effort is not undertaken soon to protect and
preserve our underwater wonders, they _ like the classic Seven
Wonders of the World _ could be lost forever through carelessness,
negligence or deliberate mistreatment,'' he said.
   The seven underwater wonders, selected by the 14-member panel of
marine scientists, conservationists and explorers, are:
   Palau, an island group in Micronesia; the northern Red Sea; the
Great Barrier Reef of Australia; the waters of the Galapagos Islands
off the coast of Ecuador; Lake Baikal in Siberia; the Belize Barrier
Reef; and the deep ocean vents in the middle of the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans.
   An honorable mention went to whales as one of the great living
wonders of the seas.
   CEDAM International is a non-profit group of 1,000 mostly marine
scientists and conservationists based at Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
   The educational campaign will include collecting data and
publishing information packets about the seven sites, a documentary
series, a touring exhibit of underwater photographs, school
curricula on marine conservation and an art-quality photo book.
   Carpenter, an environmental consultant from Vail, Colo., blamed
the world's runaway population for the declining health of the
oceans and marine life.
   ``We've got to stop population growth and we've got to eliminate
our ignorance,'' he said.
   ``The ocean is a very delicate entity and people don't realize
that. Without healthy oceans, a healthy planet is impossible.''
   The 13 other panelists included representatives of the
Smithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society, the United
Nations, the New York Aquarium, the New York Zoological Society,
Wildlife Conservation International, the University of Maryland, the
federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO,
Australia's largest scientific and industrial research organization.

   A young man from a poor, Hispanic
neighborhood who went on to attend Harvard University was sentenced
to 10 years in prison for six armed robberies committed during
school breaks.
   Jose Luis Razo, 22, was convicted in June of six robberies and
attempting to escape police after his 1987 arrest in Orange County.
He was found innocent of four other robberies.
   ``He's earned his way to Harvard, but he also earned his way to
prison,'' Deputy District Attorney Ravi Mehta told the court before
sentencing. ``Mr. Razo needs to pay his dues to society now. Mr.
Razo needs to be punished for what he's done.''
   Razo also faces trial in Los Angeles County, where he is charged
with three counts of robbery and six of assault with a deadly weapon.
   ``I have not disregarded the good things I have learned about
you, Mr. Razo,'' Orange County Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer
said before she sentenced Razo on Friday. ``This is not a happy
sentencing for this court.''
   Rheinheimer, who could have given him a maximum 15-year term, was
asked by the defense to consider Razo's achievements as a star
athlete and scholar who gave time to charity.
   ``I don't know how it is that a boy such as Jose Razo stands
before this court facing 15 years in state prison,'' said attorney
John Barnett. ``Perhaps the gap between the barrio of La Habra and
Harvard University was just too wide for him to pass.''
   But Rheinheimer said she could not ignore the fact the crimes
were premeditated and occurred over a two-year period, showing what
she called a ``pattern of conduct dangerous to society.''
   Each of the 10 store robberies, committed between December 1985
and June 1987, occurred during school breaks while he attended
Harvard for two years.
   Razo sat expressionless Friday as the sentence was read. His
tearful parents refused to comment. ``What can we say?'' Jose Razo
Sr. said.
   Barnett said he planned an appeal.
   He called the sentence too severe, but added, ``The judge gave
her honest opinion of what the crimes were worth and what the
defendant was worth.''
   With credit for time served and for good behavior, Razo could be
eligible for release in about three years, Mehta said outside court.
Razo will then face three years on parole. A $500 fine also was
imposed.
   Razo was a former high school football star, Boys Club ``Boy of
the Year'' and outstanding student at Servite Roman Catholic High
School in Anaheim.
   The prosecution's case relied heavily on a videotaped confession
in which Razo recounted with vivid detail the crimes, each committed
by a gunman wearing a ski mask. The holdups at fast-food
restaurants, grocery and drug stores, netted the gunman $27,000.
   Razo later retracted the confession, saying he was in a
drug-induced stupor. He claimed he was describing crimes actually
committed by a friend.

<HEAD>Schroeder Says Philippines Shouldn't Expect Large Sums of U.S. Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat who
heads the panel that funds U.S. military bases, says the Philippines
will have ``a long wait coming'' if they expect large sums of U.S.
aid.
   Her comments came as the United States and the Philippines
prepare to start negotiations on renewing six military base leases
that expire in 1991. Many Filipino lawmakers are demanding far
higher U.S. aid in return, or a phased withdrawal of American forces.
   Schroeder, just back from a 16-day trip to Japan, the
Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea, said the Philippines
wants $2 billion each year.
   ``I told them that if they are waiting for foreign aid to more
than double, they have a long wait coming,'' she said in a statement
Friday.
   Her sentiments have been echoed in recent weeks by other
lawmakers visiting the region over the summer recess.
   The United States agreed to pay the Philippines some $960 million
until 1991, but Schroeder said she would introduce a bill to sever
the link between U.S. foreign aid for the Philippines and U.S. base
rights there.
   ``Either a base is necessary for mutual defense or it is not,''
she said.
   Schroeder also issued a report she commissioned from the General
Accounting Office, the watchdog agency of Congress, which said Japan
could save the United States $600 million annually by assuming
payments in Japanese yen for such things as utility bills and
salaries of Japanese workers on the bases.
   The report also disputed Japan's claim that it cannot increase
support for U.S. forces without renegotiating the 1960 agreement for
the stationing of American troops there.
   ``The Japanese are hiding behind this document, and our
government lets them get away with it,'' Schroeder said.
   The study praised Japan for increasing its share of funding for
the U.S. forces from 24 percent in 1981 to 31 percent or $1.7
billion in 1987. But it said much of the gain resulted from the fact
that the stronger yen now buys more dollars.
   ``Although the increase in Japanese support from 1981 to 1987 is
impressive when measured in U.S. dollars, much of it can be
attributed to the decline of the dollar's value against the yen,''
the report said.
   When measured in dollars, Japan's cash contributions rose 137
percent, but because of the strengthening of the yen, the actual
increase was 44 percent, the study found.

<HEAD>22-Foot Tall, 5-Ton Sculpture in Reno Honors Basque Shepherders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the burden of a sheep thrown over his
shoulder, a sculpture of a Basque shepherder stands against the
solitude of a grassy knoll in western Nevada.
   ``A figure as if sculpted by the wind itself,'' says an
inscription on a concrete incline leading to the 22-foot-tall, 5-ton
abstract bronze sculpture. ``A man solitary and strong, held
straight by his own will, patient laborer facing onto the uncertain
horizon of adventure.''
   The sculpture, scheduled to be dedicated Sunday, culminates a
four-year, $350,000 effort by Basques in America, France and Spain
to erect a U.S. monument to thousands of their countrymen who began
coming here during the 1850s gold rush to roam the mountains,
keeping watch over sheep.
   For 100 years, an estimated 95 percent of all shepherds in the
West were Basques who had come to the U.S. with a few dollars and
worked to amass their own herds, eventually owning the largest sheep
ranches in the United States.
   ``We felt if we didn't do something to honor our heritage, what
brought us all here to this country, we would be lost in the melting
pot of America,'' explained Janet Inda of Reno, secretary-treasurer
of the national Basque Club.
   Basque sculptor and noted artist Nestor Basterretxea said he
wanted the monument named ``Solitude'' to capture the loneliness of
the shepherd's life.
   ``I wanted it to look as though it was a stone carved from the
wind,'' he said Thursday through an interpreter as the huge
sculpture was erected. ``I wanted the shepherder to be part of the
elements.''
   Gene Sullivan, director of the Washoe County Parks Department,
said the Rancho San Rafael Park knoll was specifically selected as
the site of the only monument to Basque shepherders in America
because it used to be a sheep ranch.
   ``There just couldn't be a better place for this,'' Sullivan
said. ``It's a typical sheep grazing area.''
   The Reno site also was selected because it is the geographic
center of the largest population of Basques in the United States.
About 90 percent of U.S. Basques live in Nevada, California or
Idaho, according to Mrs. Inga.
   About 75,000 to 100,000 Americans have Basque ancestry. Basques
hail from the Pyrenees Mountains along the border between France and
Spain.
   Foreign dignitaries, including 70 Basque nationals, have traveled
to Reno for the dedication Sunday morning. The event coincides with
the city's annual Basque Festival, which begins today.
   The bronze sculpture was cast in Mexico City and almost didn't
make it out of Mexico because of red tape.
   But prominent Nevada Basques helped cut the red tape, including
author Robert Laxalt, whose brother Paul is a former U.S. senator.
   ``It was held up by the Mexican Ministry of Fine Art,'' said
Laxalt, adding he used White House contacts to help get it out of
the country earlier this week. The Ministry of Fine Art released the
sculpture after authorities were assured it wasn't a Mexican
national treasure.
   ``This has been a four-year effort to memorialize the only
forgotten stereotype in the building of the early West,'' Laxalt
said. ``You have the Pony Express riders, the miners and the
cowboys, but the shepherders always were low profile and lived in
solitude.''

   The 16 presidential candidates who received
primary matching funds last year spent more than three times as much
in the pre-convention period as the 15 in the race 12 years earlier,
the Federal Election Commission reports.
   In its final statistical report on the 1988 presidential
pre-nomination campaigns, the FEC said Friday that the eight
Democrats, six Republicans and two outside candidates spent $211
million and took in $214 million.
   These are ``adjusted'' figures after transfers, refunds of loans
and contributions and rebates have been subtracted.
   In 1976, the corresponding figures were $68 million in receipts
and $67 million in expenditures.
   Four years later, 10 candidates took in $94 million and spent $92
million. In 1984, when there were 11 candidates, receipts increased
to $105 million and expenditures to $103 million.
   Federal matching funds accounted for $66 million, or 31 percent,
of the 1988 receipts. Individual contributors gave $141 million, or
66 percent. Contributions from political action committees totaled
$3 million, or 1.4 percent.
   Independent expenditures on behalf of presidential candidates
totaled $10.7 million, while independent negative campaigning
against candidates came to $3.4 million.
   Adjusted figures for Democratic candidates were:
   _Bruce Babbitt, receipts $3.38 million, expenditures $3.35
million.
   _Joseph Biden, receipts $3.74 million, expenditures $3.74 million.
   _Michael Dukakis, receipts $28.5 million, expenditures $28.16
million.
   _Richard Gephardt, receipts $10.3 million, expenditures $10.3
million.
   _Albert Gore Jr., receipts $12.34 million, expenditures $12.33
million.
   _Gary Hart, receipts $3.43 million, expenditures $3.28 million.
   _Jesse L. Jackson, receipts $19.96 million, expenditures $19.39
million.
   _Paul Simon, receipts $10.09 million, expenditures $9.59 million.
   For Republican candidates, the corresponding figures were:
   _George Bush, receipts $31.8 million, expenditures $30.64 million.
   _Robert J. Dole, receipts $26.53 million, expenditures $26.46
million.
   _Pete Du Pont, receipts $8.06 million, expenditures $8.03 million.
   _Alexander M. Haig Jr., receipts $2.05 million, expenditures
$2.03 million.
   _Jack Kemp, receipts $16.7 million, expenditures $16.51 million.
   _Marion G. ``Pat'' Robertson, receipts $30.9, expenditures $30.89
million.
   Independent Party candidate Lenora B. Fulani had adjusted
receipts of $2.15 million and expenditures of $2.13 million.
   Extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche, who appeared on ballots as a
Democrat although disavowed by the party, had receipts of $3.86
million and expenditures of $3.84 million.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole says he'll
seek increased American aid for reconstruction in earthquake-damaged
Soviet Armenia.
   The Kansas Republican, according to a statement released by his
office here Friday, made the pledge in Poland after he and his wife,
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, toured the damaged areas in Armenia
and delivered $50,000 worth of relief supplies.
   The supplies were gathered by Project Hope, a private U.S. relief
agency.
   The U.S. government has provided $4 million worth of assistance,
most of it in transportation, since the Dec. 7 earthquake that
killed 25,000 people. Americans have given another $160 million
privately, Dole said.
   ``If anybody wants to look at a place where they could use help _
whether they're children, whether they're schools, whether they're
homes _ here's a little country of 3.3 million people with 700,000
homeless,'' he said.

Angolan factions to reach a cease-fire to end the outbreak of
violence in the civil war there.
   ``In order for there to be an effective cease-fire, there must be
a comprehensive cease-fire agreement. Such an agreement would be in
the interest of both sides,'' State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Friday.
   Angola's UNITA guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi on Thursday
renounced a truce that began in June. The agreement between Savimbi
and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was designed to end
the 14-year civil war.
   The truce began collapsing the week after it began. UNITA said
Friday that 77 government troops and six of its rebels were killed
in heavy fighting this week.
   F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's acting president, and Zaire's
President Mobutu Sese Seko agreed at a summit meeting Friday in
Goma, Zaire, to cooperate in trying to salvage the Angolan peace
agreement.
   Mobutu has been spearheading efforts to negotiate a settlement of
Angola's civil war, and South Africa has endorsed his initiative
after ending its material support for UNITA.
   Boucher said the United States was urging Angolan factions ``to
resume negotiations under Zairean mediation'' to reach a cease-fire
agreement.
   Western-backed UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, has been fighting the
government and its Cuban allies to force a power-sharing agreement
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<NOTE>Severe Cold Harms Projected Hazelnut Harvest</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's filbert harvest in Oregon and
Washington is estimated at 13,500 tons, down 18 percent from 1988
and the smallest output since 1984, the Agriculture Department says.
   The Oregon crop of filberts, or hazelnuts, was forecast at 13,300
tons, compared with 16,300 tons in 1988. The Washington harvest was
indicated at 200 tons, the same as last year.
   Officials said filbert trees, particularly of the Barcelona
variety, were hurt by severe cold in early February during their
crucial pollination stage.
   ``As a result, nut set is lighter than in 1988,'' said Friday's
report. ``Also, growers report a larger-than-normal number of
blanks. Nut size, however, is up significantly from last year.''

<HEAD>Erin Moves Northward As Weakening Predicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While cooler mid-Atlantic waters continue to sap
Hurricane Erin's strength today, forecasters say it's too early to
waive caution.
   They note a similar storm in 1987 traveled northward to lash
Great Britain, causing substantial damage.
   The National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables predicts
Erin is heading somewhere between Greenland and Ireland.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT on Friday, Erin's center was located near 43.0
north latitude and 35.4 west longitude, or about 310 miles west
northwest of the westernmost Azores. The system was moving northeast
at about 25 mph and was expected to weaken gradually over the next
24 hours.
   The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, will probably
lose its tropical characteristics over the North Atlantic, but could
cause damage if it makes landfall, Kimberlain said.
   Erin was spawned off the African coast and became a named storm
Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph. It reached the 74
mph threshold for a hurricane Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, forecasters report the eighth tropical depression of
the year formed late Friday off the African coast.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the depression was located at 16.9 north
latitude and 21.5 west longitude, or about 100 miles east of the
easternmost Cape Verde islands. The depression, with maximum
sustained winds of 35 mph, was moving westward at about 17 mph with
some stregthening expected.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Erin
is the fifth named storm and the third hurricane of the year.

<HEAD>Contra Forces to be Disbanded Starting Sept. 6</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After eight years of guerrilla war, the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels who fought to topple Nicaragua's
Sandinista government will begin disbanding in less than two weeks.
   The secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
Joao Clemente Baena Soares of Brazil, and U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar announced Friday that work will begin Sept.
6.
   Perez de Cuellar met with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
d'Escoto Brockmann to discuss resettling the estimated 11,000 to
12,000 Nicaraguan rebels, now based in Honduras.
   Upon learning that dates had been fixed for the demobilization of
the Contras, d'Escoto said: ``That is very good news; we have wanted
that for a very long time.
   ``I would imagine that the vast majority of the people would want
to come home. Even some of the Miami contras have returned,'' said
d'Escoto.
   Under an agreement signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala, the U.S.-supported
Contras are to repatriated or resettled in other countries.
   The Tela Declaration calls for the rebels to be resettled by Dec.
5.
   Numerous Contra field commanders and guerrillas have said they
will not give up their fight.
   However, a U.N. diplomat active in Central American affairs said
preliminary talks with the rebels indicate they are quite willing to
go home or be resettled, and that little resistance is expected.
   Disarming and resettling the Contras will require a new U.N.
peacekeeping force, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The world body's experts believe the size and cost of such a
force can be minimized if the Contras are disarmed over a period of
months in small groups, rather than rounded up and disarmed at once,
he said.
   The United States had lobbied the Central American nations to
allow the Contras to stay in their border camps in Honduras until
national elections are held in Nicaragua on Feb. 25, to maintain
pressure on the Sandinistas to allow a fair campaign.
   Even Honduras, however, which has received lavish military and
foreign aid from Washington, agreed earlier this month that there
was no justification to allow the Contras to remain until then.
   The United States gives the Contras $4.5 million a month in
non-lethal aid, which may also be used for resettlement.
   Congress cut off money for weapons last year. The Contras later
negotiated a truce with the Sandinistas and since then have launched
only sporadic raids.
   Perez de Cuellar also met Friday with El Salvador's foreign
minister, Jose Manuel Pacas Castro.
   El Salvador wants its Central American neighbors to turn their
attention on disbanding the leftist rebel force trying to topple its
government, a goal the U.S. government shares.
   The joint U.N.-OAS statement alluded to that aim by saying
efforts will be made to disband and resettle ``all those involved in
armed actions in the countries of the region when they voluntarily
seek it.''
   The Salvadoran rebels are the Faribundo Marti Liberation Front,
known by its Spanish acronym as the FMLN.

   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., is the fourth
member of Congress to make news this year because of sexual
activities _ or alleged attempted activities.
   The House ethics committee already is investigating three
members. But there is no indication that Frank's admission Friday
that a male prostitute operated out of his Washington home for a
time would trigger an investigation.
   The three members under investigations authorized earlier this
month are Reps. Gus Savage, D-Ill.; Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens,
R-Ohio; and Jim Bates, D-Calif.
   According to news accounts, Savage fondled a Peace Corps worker
during a trip to Zaire. Savage, who is black, says the incident was
misrepresented and has called on his Chicago constituents to boycott
white-owned media outlets there.
   Lukens is appealing a $1,000 fine and 180-day jail sentence in
Ohio for conviction on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the
unruliness of a minor. A girl accused him of having sex with her
when she was 16.
   Bates has been charged with sexual harassment by two women who
worked on his staff. He has denied the accusations.

<HEAD>Inspectors to Probe Train Derailment-Explosion Disasters in Hearings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe it's just her imagination,
but Janice Evans swears the train rumbling by her home has been
louder since those hellish days in May when a train derailment was
followed by a fiery pipeline explosion.
   ``It's like you stop every time the train passes to make sure
nothing's happening. During the night it's just twice as loud,''
said Mrs. Evans, one of dozens of residents still looking for
explanations and blame for the twin disasters.
   Beginning Monday, some of their questions may be answered when
the National Transportation Safety Board begins five days of
hearings into the May 12 derailment of a Southern Pacific freight
train and the May 25 explosion of a Calnev Pipe Line Co. gasoline
line near the tracks.
   The two disasters killed six people and destroyed 15 homes,
focusing new attention on pipeline safety. The NTSB hearing is
intended to gather information to help the board determine a cause
of the disasters and to make recommendations to prevent further
accidents, said board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   The board will pursue how workers calculated the load weight on
the train, the quality of locomotive brakes, the cleanup of train
wreckage near the Calnev pipeline and the effectiveness of check
valves in the line.
   A final report, with the probable cause, is expected in at least
six months.
   In the meantime, `We're just kind of in limbo,'' said Mrs. Evans,
whose house escaped serious damage but who continues to see a
psychologist to help her deal with the emotional trauma caused by
the disasters.
   The NTSB hearing marks the latest in a series of public hearings
probing the disasters.
   In earlier sessions, government officials called the nation's
pipeline safety programs inadequate, while industry officials
responded by pointing to the industry's relatively good safety
record.
   Some of the sharpest criticism of the government's role in
pipeline safety has come from Democratic lawmakers who say
regulators are burdened by staff shortages, out-of-date equipment
and a tangle of weak and confusing laws.
   The state's Pipeline Safety Division, which acts as the federal
government's surrogate in pipeline regulation, employs 12 people to
oversee thousands of miles of lines.
   Officials acknowledged that for several hours after the
derailment they didn't even know of the existence of the Duffy
Street pipeline, which supplies 90 percent of Las Vegas' gas and
nearly all the jet fuel to George and Edwards air force bases.
   The federal Office of Pipeline Safety said the Calnev line may
not have exploded after the train derailment had authorities been
given the power to order a pressure test on the line to search out
leaks and weak spots. Calnev did not perform the test, saying it did
not appear necessary at the time.
   Three check valves in the pipeline uphill from the rupture failed
to close after the blast and gasoline flowed back into the flames,
NTSB inspectors found.
   Investigators discovered that the valves had not been inspected
or maintained since they were installed along with the pipeline in
1970.
   Calnev has since inspected its valves and taken other steps in
the wake of disasters, said spokesman Richard Kline.
   Calnev, like other pipeline companies, vigorously defends its
practices by pointing to its safety record, which shows that
carrying fuel through pipelines is considerably safer than carrying
fuel in tanker trucks or railroad cars.

<TEXT>
   NYNEX Corp. and its striking telephone workers
agreed to go back to the bargaining table for the first formal talks
since a walkout started almost three weeks ago.
   In a terse statement Friday, NYNEX said both sides had agreed to
resume talking Wednesday to ``negotiate all items in the contract,
including the health care issue.''
   Employee contributions to health-insurance plans have been a
major issue in the Aug. 6 strike by more than 60,000 workers in New
York and New England.
   Nationally, 200,000 workers in 20 states struck. But union
leaders have negotiated settlements with striking employees at
Pacific Telesis, which serves Caifornia and Nevada; most of
Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves five Midwest states; and Bell
Atlantic in West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware,
Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., but not in New Jersey.
   Communications Workers of America vice president Jan Pierce
announced Thursday that his union was increasing harassment tactics
to get NYNEX to the bargaining table. Hours later, several hundred
CWA pickets demonstrated outside the suburban home of NYNEX
president William Ferguson.
   NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo said Friday that the return to
negotiations resulted from ``simply good faith, no particular
reason.''
   In addition to talks between the CWA and NYNEX in Rye, north of
New York City, representatives of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers in New England were to resume talks with company
officials in Boston Wednesday.

<HEAD>Indicted Opposition Leader to Launch Anti-Government Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INCHON, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the largest opposition
party, under indictment in connection with a spy case, said today he
is launching a campaign to get his prosecutor fired and to force the
government to expedite reform.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the Party for Peace and Democracy, said it
will battle the government in the National Assembly, the courts and
among the people to speed democratic reforms and wipe out legacies
of past authoritarian regimes.
   ``There are over 900 political prisoners in jail. This is more
than were jailed at any one time under the Chun Doo-hwan regime,''
he said, referring to the predecessor of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Speaking at a news conference prior to a rally in the western
port of Inchon, Kim said the indictment against him ``is tantamount
to the government of Roh Tae-woo declaring it has given up its
willingness to carry out reforms toward democracy.''
   Kim and two members of his party were indicted Friday for failing
to report the illegal visit to North Korea by National Assemblyman
Suh Kyung-won.
   Suh has been jailed on charges of violating national security
laws, espionage and accepting $120,000 from communist agents. He
surrendered to authorities June 25 and was formally charged and
expelled from the party three days later for a trip made in August
1988.
   National security laws forbid unauthorized travel to communist
North Korea, which South Korea has considered an enemy since the
peninsula was divided in 1945. The two Koreas fought a war in
1950-53, but a peace treaty was never signed.
   Kim, who ran for president in 1971 and 1987, has denied he had
prior knowledge of Suh's trip or espionage, and says the government
has purposely harassed the opposition party to discredit and
embarrass it among voters.
   He said his party will introduce a resolution in the National
Assembly seeking the dismissal of Prosecutor General Kim Ki-chun, in
charge of investigating the case, and will call for televised
hearings on democratic reform.
   In September, he said, the party will begin a nationwide petition
drive to press demands for democratization and will hold rallies in
27 cities to denounce political suppression.
   Kim charged that ``tortures are practiced widely even though the
constitution guarantees the rights of suspects to be assisted by
counsel.'' Kim claimed Suh had been physically tortured for 50 days
by being allowed to sleep only in brief intervals and enduring
interrogations standing.
   He said others have had to endure similar torture.

<HEAD>What Do Inmates in KGB Prison Read? Gorbachev's Writings, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The works of Mikhail S. Gorbachev are popular with
at least one captive audience _ inmates at the KGB's Lefortovo
Prison, a newspaper said.
   ``There is much interest in political developments taking place
in the country,'' the government daily Izvestia reported Friday. It
said inmates at the eastern Moscow prison _ whose cells have housed
U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers and West German daredevil flier Mathias
Rust _ are ``avid'' readers of the Soviet president's writings and
speeches.
   Also popular are speeches and documents from last year's national
Communist Party conference and the inaugural session of the
country's new parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies,
Izvestia said. Participants in those meetings scathingly criticized
Soviet problems, and some even called for legal checks on the state
agency that runs Lefortovo, the KGB secret police.
   Gorbachev may soon have competition for readers behind bars,
however.
   Izvestia noted inmates will soon be able to read Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's ``Gulag Archipelago,'' an expose of the cruelties of
the Soviet prison and labor camp system since the days of Lenin.

   Police believe the killing of Black
Panther co-founder Huey P. Newton was an attempt by an admitted drug
dealer to make a name for himself in a notorious prison-based gang.
   Tyrone Robinson, 25, told investigators Friday he fatally shot
Newton in self-defense after the one-time activist brandished a gun
in a desperate act to obtain crack, Police Sgt. Dan Mercado said.
   Other witnesses told police Newton was unarmed, Mercado said.
   Robinson, on parole for robbery, was arrested Tuesday on a
weapons charge 14 hours after Newton's death and about a block from
the scene of the killing. He admitted to the killing Friday morning,
while still in custody, was charged with investigation of murder and
faces arraignment Tuesday, Mercado said.
   ``He wanted to be a high mucky-muck; he was a foot soldier and he
wanted to be a shot-caller,'' Mercado said.
   Robinson ``considered the murder a means to advance'' in the gang
hierarchy of the Black Guerrilla Family, Mercado said.
   At a news conference Friday, police said they believed the
confrontation was the latest in a series of run-ins between Newton
and the drug-dealing gang.
   It occurred in a neighborhood where Newton, as minister of
defense for the Black Panther Party, helped set up social programs
to combat racism and help destitute blacks in the 1960s.
   Newton, 47, more recently had a history of substance abuse and
entered a hospital treatment program in 1984. Police said they
believe he had been using cocaine throughout Monday evening and
early Tuesday.
   Mercado said Newton crossed the Black Guerrilla Family several
times by stealing drugs, including earlier this summer when Robinson
said he was robbed by Newton of 14 crack pieces worth $160. Highly
potent and addictive, crack consists of the hard, pebblelike pieces
of cocaine prepared for smoking. Newton and Robinson had known each
other for about two years, said police.
   The Black Guerrilla Family operates on the streets of West Coast
cities and in California's maximum-security prisons, including San
Quentin Prison, where Newton served time earlier this year for a
parole violation.
   According to a police account, Newton went to a ``crack house''
in a drug-torn west Oakland neighborhood early Tuesday and caused a
commotion in an attempt to obtain the drug.
   He was told to leave the house and ran into Robinson a short
distance away.
   Robinson said Newton pulled a gun and demanded drugs. Robinson
said he refused to sell the drugs to Newton and shot him in
self-defense.
   Mercado said a man accompanying Robinson witnessed the shooting,
but police did not divulge whether the man, arrested Friday for
investigation of auto theft, backed up Robinson's claim of
self-defense. Police did not release the man's identity.
   Police said they recovered the 9mm handgun they believe was used
in Newton's slaying, but provided no other details. Ballistic test
results are pending.
   Two other men were arrested with Robinson on Tuesday, also on
weapons charges, but are not considered suspects in the Newton
killing, Mercado said.
   Earlier Friday, a radical group held an angry protest that blamed
the government for Newton's death. Newton's funeral is Monday.
   At least 40 members and supporters of Uhuru House took part in a
noontime march in Oakland during which they chanted, ``Who killed
Huey? Don't you tell no lie, it was the government, the government,
the FBI.''
   Congressional hearings in 1976 revealed that FBI infiltrators
sought to disrupt the Black Panthers and their efforts contributed
to the downfall of the organization.

<TEXT>
   China's Shanxi province has confiscated 2,700 cars
from bureaucrats who squandered public money, according to an
official report today.
   The Guangming Daily said the northern province, one of China's
poorest, earned $13.5 million by reselling the vehicles and fining
government departments that illegally purchased the cars last year.
   The money will go to education, boosting the province's education
budget by 7.1 percent this year, the newspaper said.
   New cars have been a main target of a yearlong government
campaign to cut waste and reduce public spending. The Communist
Party Politburo last month barred all senior party and government
leaders from driving imported cars.
   But the Guangming Daily said local departments in Shanxi had
ignored government restrictions on buying new vehicles, and that
many cars were obtained fraudulently.
   Some offices used money set aside for natural disasters and
education, while others used their cars for personal pleasure and
profit, the daily reported. Many of the offices registered their
cars in the names of individuals or army units.
   Offices found violating regulations on buying cars were fined 30
percent to 40 percent of the car's value, the daily said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is courting more Japanese business
by dangling the possibility of access to declassified military
technology, including the know-how that went into building the
Soviet space shuttle, Tass said.
   On Friday, Soviet and Japanese business officials ended a
three-day meeting in Moscow. The chiefs of the Japanese delegation
were also received in the Kremlin by Prime Minister Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov.
   The Soviets hope Japan will serve as a source of capital and
technology they can use for modernizing their country's stagnant
economy, especially in the vast, underdeveloped stretches of eastern
Siberia.
   Vladislav Malkevich, chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce,
said his delegation made a pitch for more trade by offering access
to defense technology that has been declassified in keeping with the
reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``What is at issue is certainly not joint SS-20 missile
production,'' Malkevich told a Friday news conference. ``But many of
the recently declassified defense technologies could be of interest
to Japanese firms.
   ``A packet of proposals for such cooperation, including part of
the technologies of the Soviet Buran reusable spaceship, was handed
over to them in the course of the meeting.''
   At the Kremlin, Ryzhkov called for creating joint enterprises in
the Soviet Far East and Siberia to process timber and foodstuffs and
manufacture consumer goods, Tass said.
   The Soviet prime minister told his guests the Kremlin is seeking
``full-blooded and good-neighborly relations'' with Japan.

<HEAD>Southeast Asian Lawmakers to Urge Superpowers to Support Regional
Neutrality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Southeast Asian lawmakers today called
for the dismantling of all foreign military bases in the region, but
they also said neutrality cannot assure peace without superpower
cooperation.
   Delegates to the six-day meeting of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations' Inter-Parliamentary Organization made the statement
in a communique issued at the close of the meeting.
   The communique said closure of foreign bases and the removal of
nuclear weapons ``will greatly facilitate the early realization of
the establishment of the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality and
Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone.''
   It did not give a date for when such bases should be dismantled
or directly mention the Philippines, which hosts six U.S.-run
military installations.
   Aside from the Philippines, the non-communist Asian association
is composed of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
   The communique said association members must ``at the appropriate
time'' consult the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Japan,
India and other world powers about the region's bid to establish a
neutrality zone and gain their recognition and support.
   ``Without (their) recognition, without the guarantees, peace and
freedom remain as elusive as today,'' Peter Sung, Singapore's
minister of state for foreign affairs and national development, told
reporters.
   In the Philippines, the United States maintains Clark Air Base,
the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations under an
agreement that expires in September 1991. Talks are expected to
begin late this year on extending the agreement.
   President Corazon Aquino refuses to say whether she supports a
new agreement, which must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate.
   On Thursday, 12 senators called for closing the bases in 1991,
showing the Aquino administration lacks the votes for ratification.
   The issue is expected to figure in talks during Mrs. Aquino's
visit to Washington in November.

   A British Airways jumbo jet with 291 passengers
flying from Chicago to London's Heathrow Airport diverted in
mid-flight to Montreal following a false-alarm fire alert, the
airline reported.
   An airline spokesman said Flight BA298, a Boeing 747, had taken
off Friday night from Chicago bound for Heathrow when a warning
light on the flight deck indicated a fire in the cargo hold.
   ``The captain decided to divert to the nearest available airport,
which happened to be Montreal, as a natural precaution,'' said the
spokesman, who in accordance with British practice spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``It turned out there was no fire and the warning light had come
on because of an electrical fault,'' he said.
   He said the passengers were booked into a Montreal hotel for the
night before resuming their journey in the same plane today.

   Police searched for an 18-year-old suspect and
put bulletproof vests on five young white men subjected to death
threats after they were charged with participating in a fatal racial
attack.
   The five were charged Friday in the death of Yusef Hawkins, 16,
who was shot Wednesday night when he and three friends, all black,
went to the mostly white Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn to try
to buy a used car.
   Police said Hawkins and his friend ran into a gang of 10 to 30
young people armed with baseball bats and at least one gun in rage
against interracial dating.
   Parallels to the 1986 Howard Beach case deepened as it emerged
that one of Hawkins' companions, Luther Sylvester, 17, is a cousin
of Michael Griffith. Griffith was chased to his death in Howard
Beach by a gang of white teen-agers angry that blacks entered their
neighborhood.
   As condemnation mounted from civil rights leaders and candidates
in this year's city elections, police announced a $10,000 reward for
information leading to other arrests and convictions in the case.
   The New York Times and the Daily News reported in their Saturday
editions that witnesses identified an 18-year-old as the gunman and
that he was the subject of an intensive manhunt. Officially, police
said only that a sixth youth was wanted for questioning.
   The suspects charged Friday were led out of a police station
wearing bulletproof vests.
   An anonymous caller had told a desk sergeant that ``they were
going to get those guys as soon as they left the station,''
Inspector Richard Mayronne said.
   Police said the racial tragedy resulted from the anger of a young
man who was jilted by a girlfriend who began dating a dark-skinned
Hispanic man. The gang gathered to waylay black or Hispanics youths
they thought were coming to the neighborhood to attend Gina
Feliciano's 18th birthday party.
   Miss Feliciano, fearing trouble, had called off the party, and
the white youths attacked Hawkins and his friends, Sylvester,
Stanford, 18, and Troy Banner, 18.
   Keith Mondello, 18, who police say was Miss Feliciano's former
boyfriend, Steven Curreri, 18, Pasquale Raucci, 19, and Charles
Stressler, 21, were charged with assault, riot, aggravated
harassment, violation of civil rights, and menacing and possessing a
weapon, a baseball bat. Mondello and Curreri also were charged with
conspiracy.
   James Patino, 24, was charged with assault, riot, aggravated
harassment and violation of civil rights.
   Police who impounded Modello's car and opened it after waiting
for a search warrant said they found a bat inside, but no gun.
   Figures who played key roles in the Howard Beach drama also
entered the Bensonhurst case within hours of the shooting.
   Stephen Murphy, the lawyer who won the only acquittal among the
major Howard Beach defendants, is representing one of the white
Brooklyn youths. C. Vernon Mason, who as attorney for one of the
Howard Beach survivors forced appointment of a special prosecutor,
is representing Stanford.
   Murphy said Mondello was not the boyfriend jilted by Miss
Feliciano. He said Mondello conceded being at the scene and having a
bat, but maintained the youth was armed to protect himself against
the girl's threat that her black and Hispanic friends would beat him
up.
   Police said Miss Feliciano was cooperating with the investigation.
   David Dinkins, the only black candidate in the Sept. 12 mayoral
primary, condemned the racism underlying the attack by saying: ``It
wasn't mistaken identity. It was a case of any nigger will do.''
   The New York Urban League renewed its call for appointment of a
permanent special prosecutor for bias crimes. The league president,
Donald Polk, also proposed setting up sting operations in
neighborhoods with histories or recent incidents of racially
motivated harassment or violence.
   ``We in New York are, once again, confronted with an unacceptable
racial disaster ... another intolerable incident of racial
violence,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York
Civil Liberties Union.

<HEAD>Trial Begins For Parents in Starvation Death of Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE McGRAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ The parents of a 14-year-old boy never
meant for their oldest child to die, believing throughout a 42-day
fast that the Lord would save them from a financial crisis, their
attorney said.
   Larry and Leona Cottam, accused of murder in the starving death
of their son, Eric, had hoped their faith would sustain them through
hard times, defense attorney Al Flora said during opening statements
Friday in the Cottams' trial in Luzerne County court.
   Flora said the couple and their 12-year-old daughter, Laura, were
shocked when they found Eric dead Jan. 3 at their home in nearby
Nuangola.
   ``They never believed anyone would die and they thought God would
intervene,'' Flora said.
   Mrs. Cottam wept quietly throughout the opening arguments, while
her husband, a former minister in the Seventh-day Adventist Church,
sat stoically beside her.
   After Eric's death, his parents and sister were hospitalized for
malnutrition. The family went without food for six weeks despite
having saved $3,775 they said was a tithe belonging to God, police
said.
   The 5-foot-9-inch teen-ager weighed 69 pounds when he died.
   In other statements, Flora said the Cottams did not seek help
because authorities did nothing years earlier when the couple
learned their children had been sexually molested. He said they were
too scared to turn to outsiders because they were afraid the
children would be taken from them and hurt.
   ``The evidence will show more than anything else they feared the
very thing we look to for help,'' Flora said.
   Assistant District Attorney Ann Cianflone told the jury, brought
from Philadelphia because of pre-trial publicity, that the family
wanted to eat. She said Eric had tried to stay alive by eating roots
from the back yard and hiding a frying pan and oil in his bedroom.
   ``All the evidence will show that for a six-week period of time,
Larry and Leona Cottam did nothing to get out of the situation they
were in,'' she said.
   ``They did not call for help. They did not call for assistance
until after Eric Cottam had died.''
   Flora suggested during his opening arguments that the Cottam
children had been sexually molested sometime during late 1983 or
early 1984 when they attended a one-room, church-affiliated school.
   The Cottams had enrolled their children in the school, which had
only five other students at the time, when they moved to Luzerne
County after Larry Cottam had been assigned to be the pastor of four
area churches.
   Flora said the couple became concerned after Laura began
screaming in the middle of the night and would awaken, crying and
trembling. The couple pulled their children from the school.
   It was only after the couple moved to Pittsburgh, where Larry
Cottam became pastor of another church, that they learned of the
reasons behind Laura's nightmares, Flora said.
   Flora said the Cottams sought medical treatment for the children
and at the urging of hospital officials contacted state and Luzerne
County law enforcement officials for help.
   When authorities didn't take action for several months, the
Cottams decided to retreat from the outside world, Flora said.
   They moved back to Luzerne County, teaching their children at
home, and turning to God for help from financial problems when
Cottam lost his job as a truck driver, Flora said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of troops guarded a drug
kingpin's estate northwest of the capital where police seized a
bunker in a shootout and found documents containing the names of
lawyers and others working for dealers, reporters and officials said.
   The son of a leading drug lord was arrested in the raid and
questioned on Friday, police said.
   Meanwhile, cocaine traffickers threatened to kill 10 judges for
every drug suspect extradited to the United States in Colombia's war
on drugs, and hundreds of judges said they would quit if they don't
receive more protection.
   Washington said it was sending $65 million in helicopters,
weapons and other equipment to help the nation's week-old anti-drug
offensive. Bolivia and Ecuador also received two more U.S.
helicopters for the drug war, officials said.
   Police said arsonists hired by traffickers set fire to a country
club outside Medellin, home of the world's largest cocaine cartel,
continuing attacks on establishment targets that began with bombings
and arson Thursday. Police said the fire damaged two rooms.
   Authorities have arrested thousands of suspects and seized
hundreds of millions of dollars in property since the crackdown
began following the assassination of presidential hopeful Luis
Carlos Galan Aug. 18. President Virgilio Barco Thursday said no
property would be returned unless the owners appeared in person to
claim it.
   Thousands of students wearing black armbands paraded Friday
through downtown Bogota to Galan's tomb at the Metropolitan Cemetery.
   Barco, in a nationwide address on television and radio Friday
night, declared he was ``willing to go as far as is necessary'' to
wipe out the illegal drug empire.
   A day after traffickers declared ``total and absolute war,''
Barco told them ``the Colombian people have taken up the challenge.
They must know we will not retreat before any danger.''
   Army officials announced the discovery of financial documents in
a fortified rural bunker belonging to Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
reputed to be the second-ranking leader and financial brain of the
Medellin cartel. They said his son, Freddy Rodriguez Gacha, was
among those arrested in the raid Thursday near the town of Pacho, 60
miles northwest of Bogota.
   The estate was seized by the military, which exchanged gunshots
with Rodriguez Gacha's son, two nephews and seven bodyguards, the
officers told reporters of the Bogota daily El Tiempo.
   The reporters said at least 500 soldiers had cordoned off the
area Friday and were backed by six armored cars.
   Army intelligence officers interrogated the younger Rodriguez and
the bodyguards of his father, considered second in the Medellin
Cartel after Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
   Officials said the documents proved countless of the Medellin
drug cartel's criminal operations. Reporters who visited the
fortress Friday said the evidence included bookkeeping accounts and
would support incrimination of a number of real estate companies,
lawyers and other individuals in Bogota and other Colombian cities.
   Also arrested recently was Luis Fernando Galeano Berrios,
allegedly Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha's chief accountant.
   A U.S. Air Force C-5 transport plane brought in two Bell 212
helicopters that were delivered to Colombian authorities. The White
House said $20 million in aid would arrive next week.
   Anti-narcotics police of Bolivia and Ecuador received two
helicopters each during the previous 24 hours, said diplomatic and
government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said
it underscored U.S. determination to help Latin America fight drug
traffickers.
   Bolivia and Ecuador are two main sources of the cocaine processed
in Colombia.
   About 550 judges in Bogota and the surrounding province of
Cundinamarca announced plans Friday to resign to protest what they
feel is insufficient security measures. In Cali, judges staged a
two-hour strike.
   Judge Omar Eduardo Garces Bueno of Cali told reporters he and
others received threatening letters from the ``Extraditables'' _ the
name used by traffickers in their communiques.
   In the letters, the drug dealers vowed to kill 10 judges for each
suspected trafficker extradited.
   As part of the anti-narcotics war, Barco reinstated an
extradition agreement with the United States, where numerous drug
dealers are wanted.
   Since 1981, 220 judges, magistrates and judicial employees have
been killed in a campaign of terror aimed at intimidating the courts
into dropping prosecution of drug cases.
   Since Aug. 16, when Bogota magistrate Carlos Valencia Garcia was
gunned down, judges nationwide have demanded better security. They
staged a strike that ended Wednesday, although 48 Bogota judges
refused to withdraw their letters of resignation. The Supreme Court
rejected the 48 resignations on Thursday.
   The country's 32-year-old justice minister, Monica de Grieff,
said in a television interview Friday that she ``wasn't prepared to
work in times of war, such as now.''
   Bogota was rife with rumors that Mrs. de Grieff was considering
resigning, but her office refused comment. She is known to be a
target of traffickers' death threats.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc.'s chief executive officer, James
K. Batten, will become chairman of the media company's board
effective Oct. 1, replacing outgoing chairman Alvah Chapman.
   Batten, 53, who also serves as a board member of The Associated
Press, will retain his post as Knight-Ridder CEO when he assumes the
chairmanship, the company said Friday.
   Chapman, 68, has headed the board since 1982. He is to continue
to serve as chairman of the company's executive committee and as a
member of the board.
   He also will also serve as a consultant to Knight-Ridder.
   ``Everyone who cares about Knight-Ridder and has a stake in its
success will be forever indebted to Alvah Chapman,'' Batten said.
   ``In the Chapman years, Knight-Ridder has grown steadily stronger
in its performance on behalf of all our stakeholders _ our
customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders,'' he
said.
   ``I have honored my commitment,'' Chapman said, ``to the board
and CEO Jim Batten when I delayed my retirement at their request
almost 18 months beyond our mandatory retirement age.''
   Batten is a Suffolk, Va., native who began his career as editor
of the newspaper at Davidson College in North Carolina. He went on
to work as a reporter for The Charlotte Observer and Knight-Ridder's
Washington bureau, then served in editorial positions at the Detroit
Free Press and the Observer before becoming Knight-Ridder's vice
president for news in 1975.
   P. Anthony Ridder, 48, will continue as president of
Knight-Ridder's newspaper division.
   Last month, the company announced that Richard G. Capen Jr.,
publisher of The Miami Herald, will become vice chairman of
Knight-Ridder effective Sept. 1, and David Lawrence Jr., publisher
at the Free Press, will become Herald publisher.
   Chapman was Knight-Ridder's CEO from 1976 until 1988, when Batten
took the job. Chapman graduated from The Citadel in 1942 with a
bachelor of science degree in business administration, and was a
bomber pilot in World War II.
   After the war, he joined the Columbus (Ga.) Ledger-Enquirer, and
became executive vice president and general manager of the St.
Petersburg Times in 1953.
   In 1957, he became part owner, president and publisher of the
Savannah (Ga.) Morning News and Evening Press. He joined the Knight
organization three years later, and moved up to vice president and
general manager of the Herald, before becoming president in 1969.
   Chapman was named president of Knight Newspapers in 1973, and
became the first president of Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc. at the
time of the merger in 1974.
   Knight-Ridder owns 29 daily newspapers, and is completing the
sale of its eight broadcast stations. Other company investments
include cable television and business information services.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court overturned the murder
convictions of three men in an alleged ``gay-bashing,'' ruling that
the evidence failed to justify the convictions.
   The 1st District Court of Appeal said Friday that no murderous
blows were struck before the victim's head fatally struck the
pavement. The court said the man was struck twice _ slapped and
probably punched.
   ``The attack was unprovoked and seems clearly to have been
motivated solely by (the three men's) mindless homophobia,'' said
Justice William Newsom in the appeals court's 2-1 ruling.
   The court cited the legal standard for murder when no intent to
kill is shown: acting deliberately, and in disregard for human life,
a person must commit an act that is inherently life-threatening.
   That standard cannot be met by a beating unless it is ``so brutal
that death is a probable consequence,'' said Newsom.
   The court ordered the convictions reduced to involuntary
manslaughter _ a death resulting from an ordinary assault _ with a
maximum sentence of four years.
   If upheld, the ruling would reduce the men's convictions from
second-degree murder to involuntary manslaughter. Lawyers for two of
the men said they would be eligible for immediate release from
prison, where they have been since 1984 on sentences of 15 years to
life.
   ``Any anti-gay behavior is despicable, and people should be
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' said Maureen Kallins,
lawyer for defendant Timothy White. ``But this was never a murder.
... Tim White slapped someone and a slap does not make him a
murderer.''
   Deputy Attorney General Blair Hoffman said there was a good
chance the state would appeal the ruling. He said it was ``a close
question'' whether the men's actions were life-threatening, a
requirement for a murder conviction, but that the appeals court
should have let the jury resolve the issue.
   White, then 22, and co-defendants Donny Clanton, 19, and David
Rogers, 19, had driven 40 miles to San Francisco from their homes in
Vallejo. A witness quoted Rogers as saying, ``Let's go beat up some
faggots.''
   The men went to an area of San Francisco frequented by
homosexuals and pursued two passers-by. One, John O'Connell, 41, was
struck and knocked to the sidewalk; he went into a coma and died
days later. The court said the cause of death was the impact of his
head on the pavement.
   The killing, and several other assaults to which the men pleaded
guilty, prompted a public outcry. Then Mayor Dianne Feinstein posted
a $10,000 reward in the case, and a state law was passed increasing
damages in suits by victims of ``gay-bashing.''

<TEXT>
   President Mobutu Sese Seko and South African
leader F.W. de Klerk pledged cooperation but reported no
breakthroughs in talks aimed at rescuing a faltering peace agreement
in Angola.
   De Klerk, on his first diplomatic mission since he became acting
president Aug. 15, conferred for nearly three hours Friday with
Mobutu at his resort home on the shores of Lake Kivu in northeastern
Zaire.
   A joint communique described the talks as ``positive, opportune
and constructive, particularly at this critical state of
developments in Angola.''
   The statement said the leaders agreed on the need for more
discussions. They refused to answer any questions at a lakeside
luncheon following the talks.
   The Angolan government and the rebels agreed June 22 to a
cease-fire brokered by Mobutu, but the opposing sides have
repeatedly accused each other of violations. Rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi said Thursday that the truce was over, and told his forces
to prepare for further fighting.
   An official close to Friday's discussions, who requested
anonymity, suggested South Africa and Zaire would try to keep the
peace process alive by serving as intermediaries between Angola's
Marxist government and the U.S.-backed guerrilla movement.
   Mobutu has been leading efforts to negotiate a settlement of
Angola's civil war, and South Africa endorsed his initiative after
halting military assistance to the guerrillas last year.
   De Klerk is to meet Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda in
Livingstone, Zambia, on Monday _ a scheduled trip that led to his
appointment as acting president after P.W. Botha resigned in anger
over the plans.
   As leader of South Africa's ruling National Party, de Klerk is
favored to win election to a five-year term as president after
parliamentary elections Sept. 6.
   The guerrilla group, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, has been fighting since 1975 for a
power-sharing agreement with the Angolan government.
   The United States supplies the rebels with about $15 million in
aid annually and routes supplies through Zaire.
   The Angolan government and the rebels said Friday that more than
200 people had died in fighting this past week in central and
southern Angola. The casualty toll was one of the highest reported
since a cease-fire was declared in Angola in June.
   The rebels, in a statement released in Lisbon, claimed they
killed 77 government soldiers who attacked rebel positions earlier
this week.
   In Washington Friday, the Bush administration urged warring
Angolan factions to reach a cease-fire.

<HEAD>Pravda: Don't Count Poland's Communists Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish Communists may have suffered a defeat, but
nobody should write their political obituary, the Soviet Communist
Party daily Pravda said today in what appeared to be a warning to
Polish radicals.
   With the election of Soldarity member Tadeusz Mazowiecki as
Polish prime minister, Pravda said ``extremist-minded people are
hurrying to write off the Polish United Workers Party because, they
argue, it has finally found itself in isolation, abandoned by its
associates.''
   That would be premature, Pravda cautioned. In fact, it said, the
Communists by right are the most important group in Polish politics.
``One should not ignore the fact that the PUWP _ a more than
2-million-strong party of Communists _ remains the leading force of
society and has always worked and acted for the good of the people,
repeatedly led the country out of deep crises and been a herald of
all progressive reforms,'' the Soviet paper said.
   Mazowiecki's election on Thursday, with the support of many
Communist lawmakers, gave the Soviet Union and their East bloc
allies the first non-Communist chief of government in the region
since World War II.
   Mazowiecki was chosen after parliamentary elections in which
Communist candidates were trounced and after a Communist prime
minister was unable to form a government in the face of opposition
from the Solidarity labor movement.
   The Soviet government sent an immediate telegram of
congratulations to Mazowiecki, but Pravda's commentary, the most
authoritative to date, cast doubt on whether Mazowiecki can succeed
in breaking Poland's economic decline.
   ``Is this the way out of the labyrinth?'' the newspaper asked in
a headline. It never really answered the question.
   The Kremlin has repeatedly said Polish politics are purely a
matter for Poles to decide. But Pravda gave a picture of events in
the Soviet Union's western neighbor that must have seemed quite
familiar to Soviets who have seen promises of political reform at
home accompanied by food shortages and unrest.
   And yet the Polish Communist Party ``has not been discouraged,
has not given up its lofty and necessary mission to renew socialism,
to achieve national concord and to reform the economy,'' Pravda said.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 East Germans fleeing
their communist homeland defied increased Hungarian border controls
and crossed illegally into Austria, authorities said today.
   The Austria Press Agency quoted unidentified law enforcement
officials in Eisenstadt near the border as saying the East Germans
crossed into Austria overnight individually or in small family
groups.
   That marked a change from recent mass escape attempts.
   Hungary announced Friday that it would increase its contingent of
border guards because they have been overwhelmed by up to 500
escapees at a time.
   The flight of politically and economically disenchanted East
Germans into Austria began after Hungary tore down most of the
barriers on its side of the border in May. The move was welcomed in
the West as a sign of liberalization in Hungary, one of the Soviet
bloc's most reform-minded countries.
   But it has led to tensions with East Germany, which has declined
to follow the East bloc reform movement, which began in the Soviet
Union.
   West German officials estimate that since July 5,000 East Germans
with little chance of legal travel to the West have used Hungary _ a
Warsaw Pact ally that they can visit freely _ as an illegal transit
point to the West.
   West Germany, which welcomes all East Germans immigrants, has
exerted pressure on Hungary as well, calling for a humane solution
to the problem.
   Hundreds of East Germans also are refusing to leave West German
diplomatic property in Budapest, Hungary; Prague, Czechoslovakia;
and East Berlin, unless they are guaranteed safe passage to West
Germany.

   Syrian and Christian gunners battled with
howitzers today, but a police spokesman said the clashes had
slackened since a Soviet envoy started a bid to secure a stable
cease-fire.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules, said
four hours of predawn shelling subsided after 7 a.m. into
intermittent exchanges of machine gunfire and 60mm mortar rounds
across the city's dividing Green Line.
   He said two people were killed and nine wounded in the artillery
duel, which also targeted Christian ports north of the city and
Syrian gun emplacements in Moslem west Beirut.
   The Cyprus government today halted daily flights by military
helicopter between Cyprus and Lebanon's besieged Christian enclave,
sources reported.
   A Lebanese embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the ban and called it ``a temporary measure.''
   The Cyprus government declined comment, but one source said the
ban was imposed because Lebanon violated an agreement to use the
flights for humanitarian purposes only and was using them to carry
Christian military personnel.
   The helicopter flights and a daily hydrofoil service between the
Christian port of Jounieh and the Cypriot port of Larnaca, next to
the airport, have been the Christian enclave's only links with the
outside world.
   By police count, 796 people have been killed and 2,231 wounded
since the fighting began March 8 between Christian army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and Syrian forces backed by Moslem militia
allies.
   The spokesman said ``the intensity of the Syrian-Christian
clashes has diminished noticeably'' since Soviet envoy Gennady
Tarasov arrived Wednesday on a mission to halt the latest round of
violence in Lebanon's 14-year-civil war.
   Tarasov, who heads the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Middle East
department, talked with Aoun and Moslem Lebanese leaders before
leaving Friday for Damascus for meetings with Syrian officials.
   Syria, a close Soviet ally, claims to be in full agreement with
Moscow over Lebanon, which it considers within its sphere of
influence. But Tarasov's talks with Aoun contradicted the Syrian
refusal to accept the Maronite Catholic general as a negotiating
partner.
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' against Syria. He says
Syria's 40,000 troops, in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, have betrayed their mission by fighting on the
Moslem side.
   Tarasov said after meeting Aoun on Friday the Soviet Union
``strongly believes there are no military solutions to the Lebanese
problems.''
   A source close to Aoun, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the general told Tarasov of his ``full readiness to cooperate with
the Soviet effort'' on Lebanon.
   He said the Soviet envoy was working on ``a formula accepted to
all for stabilizing the security situation and lifting the
blockade'' imposed by Syria on the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
north of Beirut.
   Syria and its allies laid siege to the enclave in retaliation for
Aoun's March 6 blockade of illegal militia-run ports south of Beirut
aimed at retrieving lost taxes estimated at $100 million annually.
   A senior Moslem official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Tarasov ``offered Soviet guarantees covering the security part
of a plan to defuse the situation and address the political crisis.''
   Lebanon's Moslems, who make up a majority of the country's
population, are seeking political reform guaranteeing an equal share
of power with the traditionally dominant Christians.
   The Moslem official said the Soviet mission focused on reviving a
three-member Arab League mediation committee's peace effort in
Lebanon.
   The committee, comprising leaders of Morocco, Saudi Arabia and
Algeria, said July 28 it had reached an impasse because Syria
refused to agree to setting a timetable for pulling its troops out
of Lebanon.
   Syrian-Christian clashes escalated sharply after the committee's
report, which Aoun considered a victory for his cause.
   The Moslem source said the Soviet diplomatic effort ``did not
contradict'' the deployment of a flotilla of French warships in the
eastern Mediterranean off the Lebanese coast.
   ``The Soviet effort is the carrot and the French naval buildup is
the stick,'' the source said.
   He added that the French naval presence ``is a message'' to the
Syrians and their allies that ``storming through the (Christian)
enclave is not permitted.''
   ``It is the same message that Tarasov delivered at the diplomatic
level,'' he saidl.
   There have been reports the Syrians and Moslems militias were
planning to launch massive ground attacks against the enclave, home
to about 1 million Christians.

   Israel has set up a committee to investigate the
possible involvement of its private security companies in training
murder squads for Colombia's drug cartels, a senior Foreign Ministry
official said today.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking on Israel
radio, said Israel was not asked to conduct an investigation either
by Colombia or by the United States but has offered its cooperation
to both countries.
   ``Two days ago we asked the Colombian government at the request
of Foreign Minister (Moshe) Arens for any information available to
them, and we have offered them assistance with anything we can do,''
Netanyahu said.
   On Friday, an Israeli reserve officer denied reports he was
involved in training death squads for Colombian drug lords, saying
instead he was an instructor for a group of cattle breeders fighting
leftist guerrillas.
   Israel Television and all of the country's major dailies last
week identified Lt. Col. Yair Klein as the head of a group of four
Israeli army reserve colonels who allegedly helped train
paramilitary troops and assassination teams in Colombia.
   Klein, 44, a retired commander of a paratroop anti-terror unit
and president of a private security firm called Spearhead, was
identified in Israel on the basis of film broadcast by NBC.
   ``I trained a group of farmers who defended themselves against
terrorist organizations, mostly the group called M-19, a guerrilla
group with the goal of turning Colombia into Cuba or Nicaragua,''
Klein told national television Friday.
   A senior Defense Ministry official said Klein probably will be
questioned about his activities in Colombia. Klein returned to
Israel on Friday from the United States, the television said.
   Netanyahu has said Israel may revoke the passports of any Israeli
mercenaries proven to be involved in the training of death squads
for Colombian drug lords.
   Israel, he said, had set up ``an inter-departmental committee to
look into this, in the Foreign Ministry and other offices of the
government.''
   Klein said four Spearhead instructors started to train a group of
cattle breeders 18 months ago. He said the training lasted for six
months and the film was a ``concluding film of the training.''
   ``This group included only farmers who have been physically
injured by guerrilla bullets and survived, or had their families
killed. Nobody else was accepted into this organization,'' he said.
   Klein said the organization enjoyed the ``tacit support of the
Colombian government. The first meeting with the group was preceded
by a meeting in Bogota that included a deputy government minister,
two senior officers and a representative of a bank.''
   He said military equipment and ammunition was used during the
training, which was conducted in full view of an army camp.
   ``The Colombian government cannot say it did not know anything
about our training of such a group. I estimate it was interested in
such bodies being trained to solve the guerrilla problem,'' Klein
said.
   He said he was convinced that the group Spearhead trained was not
involved in drugs, but he left open the possibility that it was
doing so secretly.
   On Thursday, the Israeli Defense Ministry said in an official
statement that Spearhead has been denied a permit and operated
illegally in Colombia.
   It said a second firm, which it did not identify, had violated
terms of a permit to do security work in Colombia but that no link
to illegal activities had been established.
   Klein responded that he did not have a permit to work with
official bodies but didn't need one to work with private groups.
   He said Spearhead entered Colombia with the help of an Israeli
company that provided security services for the banana plantation
owners union. He declined to identify the company.
   Klein said his firm ended contacts with the group ``when we felt
we were not needed ... and had a feeling the government started to
ignore the body we trained.''
   The Israelis, he said, were replaced by two mercenaries from
Scotland, one from the United States and one from South Africa. He
said the organization may later have gotten involved in drugs.
   ``I estimate there is no organization today in Colombia that is
not linked to drugs, from the government downwards,'' Klein said.

   Pope John Paul II today appointed a Polish
Vatican official as the first papal nuncio or ambassador to Poland
since that country's Communist government severed ties to the Holy
See in 1945.
   Monsignor Jozef Kowalczyk, who was born in Tarnow, Poland, has
been the head of the Polish section of the Vatican secretariat of
state since 1978.
   Also today, the Polish state news service PAP announced the
appointment of Jerzy Kuberski, 59, as ambassador to the Holy See.
Kuberski has been in charge of Poland's working contacts with the
Holy See since 1982.
   Kowalczyk, who turns 51 on Monday, will be the only full nuncio
to a Warsaw Pact country. Cuba and Yugoslavia are the only other
Communist countries with full diplomatic relations with the Vatican.
   The Vatican and Poland restored full diplomatic ties on July 17,
two months after Poland's Parliament granted legal recognition to
the Roman Catholic Church. That recognition came after 15 years of
permanent working contacts between the Vatican and the Communist
government.
   It is the first restoration of relations between the Vatican and
a Warsaw Pact country that tried to muzzle organized religion after
World War II.
   Kowalcyzk's appointment was unusual in that he is from the
country where he will serve as nuncio. Ordained a priest in 1962,
Kowalcyzk worked for the Synod of Bishops and in the Vatican
department for the sacraments before he joined the secretariat of
state. He also heads a commission for the publication of John Paul's
writings from the years before he became the first Polish pope.
   Kuberski, a Communist Party member, has been charge d'affaires at
the Polish Embassy to the Vatican since Poland and the Holy See
re-established formal relations.
   His appointment was made by President Wojciech Jaruzelski. Under
Poland's revamped constitution, the president controls ambassadorial
appointments.
   Kuberski is a former member of the Communist Party Central
Committee and a former director of the Office of Religious Affairs.
   As head of the Team for Permanent Working Contacts with the Holy
See, he has lived the past seven years in Rome.
   Also today, the pope named Monsignor Edmond Farhat to be the
apostolic pro-nuncio in Algeria and Tunisia and the apostolic
delegate in Libya.
   As the pro-nuncio, Farhat, 56, will be the chief Vatican diplomat
in Algeria and Tunisia. He will also be the chief Vatican diplomat
in Libya, but the title apostolic delegate indicates he is
accredited to the local church instead of the government.
   Farhat was born May 20, 1933, in Ain Kfaa, Lebanon, and was
ordained March 28, 1959. He has been an undersecretary in the Synod
of Bishops since 1984.

   Police today arrested 30
demonstrators protesting a controversial rugby tour by a squad of
international stars.
   Two separate demonstrations, held hours before the start of a
match in Cape Town, were part of a nationwide anti-apartheid
campaign launched Aug. 2 to protest segregation and the Sept. 6
parliamentary elections, which exclude the black majority.
   Twenty-eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel after meeting
briefly with Willie John McBride, manager of the international squad
made up of Australian, French and British players.
   Two activists also were arrested when about 30 protesters
gathered outside the main branch of the First National Bank, which
is sponsoring the rugby tour.
   They were identified as Dawood Khan, a spokesman for the Western
Cape Traders Association, and Willie Hofmeyer, a leader of the
banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid
coalition.
   Police on Friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour. The
international team's visit has been denounced by activists as a
breach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid.
   On Friday, riot police armed with tear gas and shotguns clashed
with anti-apartheid protesters in townships near Cape Town. Police
wounded three youths and rioters reportedly killed two black men.
   The country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federations met
outside Johannesburg today and were expected to discuss possible
protest action against the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Police Commissioner Gen. Hennie de Witt on Friday imposed
restrictions on the two-day meeting of the anti-apartheid labor
groups, allowing only union members to attend, prohibiting political
banners and limiting discussions to labor issues.
   Dozens of police were present when labor officials began arriving
this morning. The two organizations are the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, which has more than 900,000 members, and the
smaller National Council of Trade Unions.
   As part of a defiance campaign led in part by the trade union
group, dozens of blacks successfully sought treatment Friday at a
whites-only hospital wing in East London and clergymen announced
plans to defy bus segregation laws in the capital city, Pretoria.
   Similar protests took place at six whites-only hospitals on Aug.
2.
   On Friday, police fired birdshot to break up a protest at
Mitchell's Plain township, wounding three mixed-race high school
students. Another police contingent set up roadblocks outside the
University of the Western Cape and fired tear gas at mixed-race and
black students who had erected barricades on the campus.
   Police officials said two officers were wounded by a gunman in
Mitchell's Plain, and reported that two black men were killed by
rioters in separate incidents elsewhere after their vehicles were
attacked, one by people hurling stones and one by a firebomb.
   In Pretoria, a group of black and white clergymen announced that
a campaign to desegregate the city's transit system will begin
Monday. The ministers said blacks would board whites-only buses and
whites would ride in mini-bus taxis, which are supposed to carry
only blacks.
   They said the weeklong campaign would be peaceful and invited
Pretoria-based foreign diplomats to observe.

<TEXT>
   Crack seizures in Western Europe amount to a few
ounces a year, a tiny haul alongside the U.S. flood. But many
Europeans are getting worried.
   ``Crack is the specter I see hanging over Europe,'' Britain's
home secretary, Douglas Hurd, told delegates of the 23-nation
Council of Europe whom he invited to London in May to discuss drug
abuse.
   ``Our job must be to work together, urgently, to ensure that the
United States experience is not repeated here,'' he said.
   Britain is the only European country already battling a crack
problem. But with crack's parent drug, cocaine, flowing into Europe
alongside horrifying images of crack's impact in the United States,
vigilance is increasing.
   Interpol, the Paris-based international police agency, now
monitors all crack seizures, rather than only those of over 100
grams, or 3.5 ounces.
   Agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency have held a workshop to
teach Italians how to spot ``il crack,'' and the problem is likely
to be high on the agendas of two major drug conferences.
   Crack is a smokeable derivative of cocaine that gives an instant,
intense ``high'' as the drug goes straight to the brain, but wears
off in a few minutes, leaving a lingering deep depression.
   But Europeans are divided over the size of the wolf at the door.
The Dutch predict they won't even have a problem. Others doubt crack
could find the home in Europe that it has in the United States,
where crime and drug abuse rates are higher.
   West German police have seized so little that they are not
keeping track. Swedish police say they have heard of its use but
haven't seized any. The Swiss confiscated two grams in 1988. Spain
and Italy have seized none.
   ``The general rule is that Europe is four to six years behind the
States,'' says Gerhard Neurohr, head of Interpol's cocaine division.
``Of course, every rule has its exceptions and crack may be an
exception.
   ``But then remember Angel Dust (slang for Phenyl Cyclohexyl
Piperidine, a powerful psychedelic drug). It swept the United States
and everybody waited in Europe for an Angel Dust wave that never
happened.''
   Nowhere is the debate more heated than in Britain, which had 31
crack seizures in the first six months of 1989, and 27 in the same
period last year. British authorities say they seized 102 grams,
about 3.6 ounces, between January 1987 and June 1989, 68 grams, or
2.4 ounces, of it in the first half of this year.
   ``Although the number of seizures is still small, they have been
quite widespread, with crack found in many of our major cities,''
Hurd told another, privately sponsored crack conference in July.
   Problem users have appeared in the last 15 months in south
London, says Steve Tippell, who heads a counseling center there and
is touring U.S. cities to study their responses.
   Because of crack's high cost here, Tippell says most users in the
British capital make their own crack, which is easy to convert from
cocaine. A ``rock'' of two smokes costs $30 to $40, double the price
in the United States.
   Interpol says crack seizures in Europe total 600 grams, about 22
ounces, since 1986, although British drug experts say this might not
include small amounts seized.
   Cocaine seizures, on the other hand, rose from 345 pounds in 1978
to almost six tons last year in Europe, exceeding the heroin haul
for the first time, Interpol says.
   ``We were caught napping when heroin first arrived in the early
'70s,'' says Hans Lundborg, narcotics bureau chief at Sweden's
Ministry for Social Affairs. ``The government can't afford to make
that same mistake again.''
   Britain is emphasizing education and treatment rather than
all-out attempts to stop suppliers.
   ``The Americans are quite clear that if they would have their
time over again, they would have given more emphasis to prevention
work,'' says Hurd.
   He told the Council of Europe meeting that Britain will increase
annual funding for education and teacher training to $11 million,
and provide extra cash for drug treatment and U.N. drug programs.
   Britain also will host an international conference next year on
fighting drugs, especially crack, and the European Parliament and
Commission will hold a similar meeting in the spring.
   ``I am convinced that crack is on its way,'' says Sir Jack
Stewart-Clark, a British European Parliament lawmaker helping
organize the Parliament meeting.
   ``The American situation today is likely to be the European
situation tomorrow, with some slight differences,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   A non-partisan group of British lawmakers, returning alarmed from
a study trip to the United States, called for targeting demand by
setting up U.S.-style helplines and a national public awareness
campaign.
   Despite his strong statements, Hurd rejects a national campaign
against crack, saying this would advertise the drug.
   Ministers recall a national drive against heroin several years
ago that was widely believed to have glamorized the drug.
   To portray crack ``sensationally as uniquely diabolical will only
add to its allure,'' wrote addiction experts John Strang and
Griffith Edwards in an Aug. 5 British Medical Journal editorial.
   But Dave Turner, director of an umbrella group of drug
organizations says: ``Some of the hype about crack and cocaine is
important in order to put pressure on the government.''
   Interpol's Neurohr also cites the high cost of crack in Europe as
well as a different mentality toward cocaine as reasons why Europe
may not be too badly affected.
   ``In the States, crack is a cheap drug for social underdogs,'' he
told The Associated Press. ``In Europe, social underdogs drink
alcohol or shoot heroin or take amphetamines.
   ``People here are well-informed ... even drug addicts discuss the
dangers of crack.''

<HEAD>Government Rejects Church Call to Release Military Rulers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday rejected an
appeal from the Orthodox Church of Greece for release of military
rulers held in jail since their junta collapsed in 1974.
   The Holy Synod, which acts as the church's ruling body, made the
unprecedented request Friday.
   It said the former dictators should be freed ``in appreciation of
the optimistic spirit currently being cultivated for the more
general reconciliation of the Greeks and the forgetting of past
misfortunes and divisions.''
   However, government spokesman Athanassios Kanellopoulos said,
``The government was never concerned with the subject, and it does
not comment on Holy Synod announcements.''
   The current government is made up of an alliance of leftists and
conservatives.
   The military, which seized power in April 1967, was toppled in
July 1974 after it engineered an abortive coup in Cyprus. The
attempt led to a Turkish invasion of the northern part of the
Mediterranean island.
   The right-wing military dictatorship was responsible for the
widespread detention and torture of political opponents and the
suppression of a student uprising in November 1973.
   Three former junta leaders were sentenced to death in August
1975, but their sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment.
Another eight were given life terms.

   Ten Indonesians have been arrested
on suspicion of smuggling 10 babies for sale to childless couples,
state-run media said Saturday.
   The babies, found Thursday in a wooden hut in Kampung Telaga Air,
were between two and three months old, the Bernama news agency
reported. It said one of the 10 babies died during the 20-mile trip
to a hospital in Kuching, about 540 miles south of Kuala Lumpur.
   The suspects are reported to have smuggled babies from the
Indonesian part of Borneo island to the Malaysian sector on
Thursday, Bernama said.
   The arrested suspects include six women and four men between 19
and 40 years old, Bernama said. Two more women were being sought, it
said.
   The nine surviving babies were in good health and remained
hospitalized, Bernama said. Officials told the news agency they were
investigating whether the infants were kidnapped or sold by their
parents.
   Some childless Malaysians pay up to $1,860 for a baby purchased
on the black market.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down U. Of Michigan Ban on Racial Harassment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of Michigan policy aimed at
cutting discriminatory harassment on campus is unconstitutional, a
federal judge ruled.
   University officials proposed the policy last year after assorted
racist acts, including a widely publicized incident in which a
student disc jockey on a campus radio show allowed a caller to tell
anti-black jokes.
   U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn ruled Friday that the policy
violates freedom of speech and was so vague that ``persons of common
intelligence must guess at its meaning.''
   The ruling likely will have national significance, said Howard
Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Michigan, which challenged the policy on behalf of an unidentified
Michigan student.
   ``Universities from Duke to Stanford and Wisconsin and in between
are faced with these same kinds of problems and are considering
similar policies to the University of Michigan,'' Simon said.
   The policy barred harassment or discrimination based on race,
ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national
origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-veteran
status. The ACLU did not challenge a part of the policy that bars
physical acts of harassment.
   ``The policy is clearly well-intentioned _ the university needs
to address problems of harmful racism on campus _ but the method by
which they chose to do so assaults the principles of free speech and
freedom of expression,'' Simon said.
   ``The judge has forced them to go back to the drawing board and
develop a policy that doesn't violate free speech but protects
students from harassment,'' he said. ``The judge performed a public
service.''
   The university's general counsel, Elsa Kircher Cole, said she was
disappointed by the ruling.
   ``We had very carefully crafted a policy that would recognize
First Amendment rights of students while addressing the very serious
problems of racial and sexual harassment on campus,'' Cole said.
   Cole said the university had begun reviewing the policy before
Cohn held a hearing on it Friday, and now will decide whether to
rewrite it or appeal the judge's ruling.
   A majority of Michigan Board of Regents had favored the policy,
but Regent Deane Baker said he glad it was struck down.
   ``My own belief is that people on campus should be completely
free to speak as they wish,'' Baker said. ``One might not agree with
what is said, but if there is any place where we should have free
speech it is our universities, where we seek to find truth.''

<HEAD>Indicted Opposition Leader Vows to Lead New Anti-Government Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A political leader indicted in a North
Korean spy case said Saturday he will try rally the country's
splintered opposition forces for a new campaign to push government
reforms.
   Kim Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy said his
indictment ``is tantamount to the government of (President) Roh
Tae-woo declaring it has given up its willingness to carry out
reforms toward democracy.''
   Kim, who heads the largest opposition party, vowed to battle the
government in the National Assembly and the courts to speed
democratic reforms and wipe out legacies of past authoritarian
regimes.
   ``There are over 900 political prisoners in jail. This is more
than were jailed at any one time under the Chun Doo-hwan regime,''
he said, referring to Roh's predecessor in remarks at a news
conference.
   Kim told a news conference that his party would introduce a
resolution in the National Assembly to fire Prosecutor General Kim
Ki-chun. He is supervising the case against Kim.
   Addressing an outdoor rally of 20,000 supporters in the western
port of Inchon later on Saturday, Kim pledged to launch ``the
strongest possible'' anti-government campaign.
   Kim and two other members of his party were indicted Friday. They
were accused of failing to report to authorities about an illegal
visit to North Korea by National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won, then a
member of Kim's party.
   Suh has been jailed on charges of violating national security
laws, espionage and accepting $120,000 from agents of the Communist
country.
   The opposition leader, who ran unsuccessfully for president in
1971 and 1987, has denied prior knowledge of Suh's trip in August
1988. Kim has said the government is attacking him an an effort to
discredit the political opposition.
   If convicted, Kim could face up to five years in prison.
   Kim said his party will begin a nationwide petition drive in
September to press for more democracy and will organize rallies in
27 cities to denounce political repression. He said his party will
join its efforts with those of other dissident forces.
   Kim Young-sam, who heads the opposition Reunification Democratic
Party, criticized the indictment of the rival party leader.
   ``The Suh case should be thoroughly investigated, but it is
nonsense to indict the head of an opposition party simply for
failing to report it to authorities,'' he told a news conference.
   His group is the second-largest opposition party. Both Kims ran
for president in 1987 during a feud among opposition forces,
splitting the opposition vote and allowing Roh to win the presidency
without a majority.
   National security laws forbid unauthorized travel to North Korea,
which South Korea has viewed as an enemy country since the peninsula
was divided in 1945. The two Koreas fought a war in 1950-53 and
never signed a peace treaty.
   In another development, about 350 radical students and families
of political prisoners held a peaceful rally at Korea University in
Seoul to denounce the Roh government. They accused authorities of
stepping up persecution of political dissenters.
   Government officials deny holding any political prisoners.

   A sustained drug crackdown in Colombia could
eventually cut the flow of cocaine into the United States, but
traffickers have too much money and too many tricks to be deterred
in the near future.
   ``In the long term we may see a considerable reduction,'' said
Charles J. Gutensohn, chief of cocaine investigations for the Drug
Enforcement Administration. ``But the problem is the cocaine is
already in the pipeline, and more people are using `crack,' which
uses less cocaine.''
   Colombian drug traffickers process and ship most of the world's
cocaine to the United States. Colombia's government, following the
murder of presidential hopeful Carlos Galan, intensified its war on
drugs by confiscating $200 million in property and making mass
arrests last week.
   In a show of support, the United States on Friday offered a $65
million aid package to help Colombia with its crackdown.
   Traffickers, however, buoyed by the big bucks and the ready
market in the United States, have been hard to stop. Many top
dealers are millionaires. And one official pointed out that pilots,
many of them Americans, can make hundreds of thousands of dollars
for a single flight in a cocaine-laden plane.
   ``They are cagey,'' Gutensohn said of the traffickers. ``They are
people who have a lot of money, and they can pay ohers to take
chances.''
   In addition, the Colombians could shift their operations to
isolated areas in neighboring countries _ Brazil, Peru or Bolivia.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday that U.S.
officials are concerned about that possibility.
   Robert Strang, a DEA special agent in New York City, said
Colombian traffickers in the United States sell their wares in large
lots of more than 200 pounds at $8,000 per pound. On the streets,
one pound broken down into grams nets a dealer $80,000.
   ``And it's even more for `crack,''' he said, referring to a form
of cocaine that is smoked. ``With one ounce of cocaine you can make
370 vials of `crack,' which means you can almost quadruple your
money.''
   In New York City alone, estimates are there are 600,000 cocaine
users, more than half of them devotees of crack, Strang said.
   Last year the DEA confiscated a record 55 tons of cocaine in the
United States, up from eight tons six years ago. But production of
the coca leaf is up in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, the largest
producers of the sturdy tree that nets four harvests a year.
   Additionally, detection of cocaine has become increasingly
difficult as traffickers find new ways to smuggle it across every
American border state.
   Officials point to the inventiveness of traffickers, who are
slipping the drugs into the United States in trucks over the Mexican
border, small planes into the southern states, and large freighters
that can be loaded at sea.
   ``We can't search them all,'' Gutensohn said.
   Smugglers have loaded cocaine at sea from one ship onto another,
some from Hong Kong and Japan, and stored the drug inside legitimate
shipments of furniture. In one case the cocaine, in liquid form, was
hidden inside plastic bags and put into a fish tank.
   ``It was discovered when the fish died,'' an administration
source said, adding that in another incident the drug was neatly and
professionally stuffed inside the planks of imported picnic tables.
   The distribution chain starts with the large drug cartels in
Colombia and then moves to Colombian dealers inside the United
States. From there it goes in quantities of up to 150 pounds to the
``trafficking groups,'' mostly Jamaicans, Dominicans and Los Angeles
street gangs, Gutensohn said.
   ``They purchase smaller levels and bring it to the inner
cities,'' he said.
   The trafficking groups sell several pounds to dealers who operate
what are called ``crack houses.'' Then the ``crack house'' owners
sell to individual users.
   ``You've got level after level,'' Gutensohn said.
   Colombian cocaine made a notable entrance on U.S. streets in the
1970s and trafficking has grown to the point where ``Cocaine and
Colombia are essentially the same thing,'' said Don Hamilton,
spokesman for the administration's Office of National Drug Control
Policy.
   ``But, hypothetically if you've locked up a dozen or so people
that would not break the trade,'' he said.
   A State Department official who deals with South American drug
issues said: ``I think they are moving the networks out of Colombia,
living there and enjoying the wealth, but the cocaine's going out
from God knows where.''
   A sustained crackdown in Colombia could ``over a long time have
an impact, but I don't think you could possibly tell for a year, and
even if you grab the bosses, there's going to be somebody else who
takes over,'' said the official, who following department guidelines
spoke on condition he not be further identified.
   Kennington Wall of the Drug Policy Foundation, a private research
group seeking alternative strategies for fighting the drug war, also
said cocaine traffickers would move their operation bases to safer
areas.
   ``If you push it down in one place, it will pop up in another,''
he said.

   The bat-like bomber took off at 8:31 a.m. from Edwards Air Force
Base, Capt. Tess Taft said.
   She did not have any other details about the flight.
   The abbreviated second test flight of the B-2 on Aug. 16 was
scrubbed in midflight because of a tiny crack in a part provided by
a defense contractor once fined for billing fraud.
   A hairline crack in a casing of an accessory drive, which powers
the $530 million high-tech jet's generators and controls, caused oil
pressure to drop during the earlier test flight, Taft said Friday.
   The bomber's maiden flight earlier this summer was termed a
success.
   Unlike the previous two test flights, today's was not announced

<HEAD>Bribes, Fraud Tarnish Generic Drugs, But Not Much</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigations of bribery and fraud
involving generic drugs have embarrassed the industry but do not
appear to be dampening the popularity of its low-cost products with
consumers.
   Industry officials and analysts say the public is so smitten with
generic drugs _ which mimic name-brand products whose patents have
expired, but cost up to 70 percent less _ there should be no
long-term damage to sales based on the revelations so far.
   The $5-billion-a-year industry has been absorbing week after week
of damaging publicity lately about falsified test results and
gratuities paid to federal officials. More is likely in the months
ahead.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore already has obtained
guilty pleas from some industry officials and federal regulators.
The Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug
Administration and Congress have ongoing investigations.
   ``The image has been tarnished, there's no question,'' said
Hemant K. Shah of Warren N.J., a private financial analyst of the
generic drug industry. ``But I really don't expect anything other
than business continuing to boom for generic drug companies.''
   Jay Molishever, spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry
Association, a trade group of 20 generic drug makers, concedes a
``fear is beginning to take hold.''
   However, Molishever adds, ``Whatever downturn may occur because
of the concern, and there is concern, we believe will be
short-term.''
   More than 400,000 prescriptions _ nearly one-third of all
prescriptions written last year in the United States _ were filled
by generic drugs. Analysts expect that market share to keep growing,
to perhaps 37 percent by 1993.
   Their optimism is bouyed by what has not been unearthed. While
instances of falsified test results and gratuities paid to federal
regulators to speed the government's approval process have been
uncovered, there have been no indications of tainted drugs.
   ``I emphasize that we have no evidence that the safety or
effectiveness of generic drugs has been compromised,'' Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in announcing a plan
to beef up federal oversight of the industry.
   Pharmacists report no great hesitation by consumers to purchase
generic drugs, other than the 26 that the Food and Drug
Administration has recalled so far.
   To put that figure in perspective, the generic drug industry says
that of 10,000 drugs approved for sale in the United States, 8,000
are copied and sold by generic producers, with more generic versions
available all the time as patents on the original products expire.
   ``It is a little bit early, but our people are not expecting to
see a dip in generic sales,'' said Maryellen Kari, spokesperson for
the Walgreen Co., the Deerfield, Ill., based drug store chain whose
$4.9 billion in sales last year made it the nation's largest.
``There seems to be very little customer alarm generated by the
publicity.''
   Continuing investigations promise to produce more news in coming
weeks.
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Baltimore _ which has jurisdiction
because the Food and Drug Administration is headquartered in
Rockville, Md. _ so far has obtained guilty pleas from three FDA
officials, three drug company officials and two drug companies for
various crimes involving the FDA's drug approval process.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Garinther says his office has
spent most of its time examining gratuities paid by companies to FDA
officials to speed approvals of generic drugs in an industry in
which the first to hit the market often gets and retains a huge
share of sales.
   Only recently, he said, have investigators begun looking into
allegations of companies substituting brand-name drugs for the
generic products they claim to be testing. Under FDA procedures,
companies send potential products to independent laboratories for
testing, and submit the results _ paperwork _ to the FDA for its
study.
   Last June, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens,
N.Y., admitted it sought FDA approval for a generic blood pressure
drug by actually testing Dyazide, the brand-name product it was
supposed to copy.
   ``My guess is there will be guilty pleas,'' Garinther said.
   The FDA is continuing its investigations of potential
irregularities by 11 generic drug companies. The agency is also
studying the 30 most commonly used generic drugs _ accounting for 75
percent of generic drug sales _ to verify that they were approved
for sale legitimately.
   The Department of Health and Human Services is auditing the FDA,
its subdivision, to make sure its oversight of generic drugs is
effective.
   In addition, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, plans to continue his series of
hearings into problems within the industry and its regulation by the
government.

<HEAD>Deng's Children Give Assurances He Is Well</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese government gave new assurances
Saturday through a visiting Chinese-American that senior leader Deng
Xiaoping is in good health, despite persistent reports that he is
seriously ill.
   Anna Chennault, head of the Republican Heritage Groups Council,
said Deng's children ``assure me he's in very good health and still
smoking and swimming and sometimes scolding them.''
   Mrs. Chennault also said that during a dinner with Beijing Mayor
Chen Xitong, he said leaders erred in using troops against
pro-democracy protesters in June.
   Chen said troops were used because police were not experienced in
handling riots and ``probably they didn't have enough police,'' Mrs.
Chennault said.
   Speaking at a news conference at the U.S. Embassy, she said Deng
sent a message via his children that ``at this time it is better for
him not to receive any foreign visitors (to) show he's not trying to
take over and trying to control all the other officials.''
   Deng, 85, holds only one official post, as head of the Central
Military Commission, and in recent years has turned over much daily
decision-making to his proteges in the Communist Party and
government.
   However, he still wields final authority, as was made clear when
he ordered the June 3-4 army attack on demonstrators in Beijing, in
which hundreds and possibly thousands died.
   Well-placed Chinese sources have said Deng is seriously ill with
cancer and is receiving medical care in Beijing. He has not been
seen in public since early June.
   Reports from a variety of sources also indicate a power struggle
is brewing over his succession, and that members of the conservative
faction that led the June crackdown are trying to play down Deng's
illness to gain time to consolidate their position.
   Mrs. Chennault, however, said she was told Deng was in Beidaihe,
a seaside resort northeast of Beijing where he and other top
officials vacationed in past summers.
   ``I think this is a time that the leadership is going through
some rearrangement of who will do what,'' said Mrs. Chennault. She
said she did not know enough about the situation to assess China's
stability.
   Mrs. Chennault, who was born in Beijing, is the widow of Gen.
Claire Lee Chennault, the famed World War II ``Flying Tigers''
founder. She has visited China often and occasionally advises
President Bush on Asian Affairs.
   She said she plans to report to Bush on her 10-day visit.
   Mrs. Chennault said she met with Vice President Wang Zhen,
Communist Party Secretariat member Ding Guangen and other officials
up to the ministerial level.
   Topics of discussion included ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang, who
was purged in late June in a power struggle over handling of the
popular, student- led democracy movement and is still being
investigated.
   He has not been seen in public since late May, and the government
has indicated he may be put on trial.
   Asked what the leaders she met thought of Zhao, Mrs. Chennault
said, ``Certainly privately people agree Zhao Ziyang did a great
deal.''
   She refused to go into more detail and would not say if her talks
covered dissident Fang Lizhi, the astrophysicist who has been hiding
in the U.S. Embassy with his wife since June.
   She also refused to say if Bush had asked her to bring Fang up to
the Chinese but said that she met with the president before leaving
for China.
   ``He did ask me verbally to tell his friends here that we are
very interested in continuing the good relationship that we have
tried so hard to build in the last more than 10 years or so,'' Mrs.
Chennault said.
   Fang's presence in the embassy has strained Chinese-U.S.
relations, already at a low point because of the crackdown. There
was speculation that one purpose of Mrs. Chennault's visit was to
discuss Fang.

   Voyager 2, discovered broad, flat bands
of dust orbiting Neptune and found evidence the planet has
``southern lights,'' NASA said today.
   The probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of Triton, the
moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited
scientists as unique in the solar system, NASA said.
   ``There's dust bands _ they're broad,'' said NASA astronomer Rich
Terrile, describing the findings from latest photorgraphs. The bands
orbit Neptune's equator, as do its narrow rings that were discovered
by Voyager earlier.
   Although Voyager has passed its closest encounters with Neptune
and Triton, it continued today to back recorded photographs taken
during the time of closest approach. And scientists and engineers
celebrated the spacecraft's successful flyby.
   ``My understanding was most of the engineers and science team had
one hell of a party last night,'' Mike Urban, a Voyager engineer,
said today.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m. PDT Friday.
   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons
besides Triton and Nereid, which were first observed from Earth. It
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a
partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be
a complete ring.
   While only the narrow rings were visible as Voyager flew toward
Neptune, the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit
by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet, Terrile said.
That makes them look like Saturn's broad rings, but only when viewed
from behind Neptune.
   The same thing happened when Voyager passed Uranus in 1986. That
planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft,
which then found extensive bands of dust after passing Uranus.
Terrile said Neptune's dust bands are not as extensive.
   Evidence for the glowing lights, known as an aurora, was found at
30 degrees south latitude on Neptune as Voyager's ultraviolet light
sensor made a north-to-south scan of the planet, deputy project
scientist Ellis Miner said today.
   Because the scan didn't cover different longitudes, scientists
don't know the aurora's full extent, or whether it circles Neptune
east to west, as do Earth's auroras, Miner said.
   Miner said Voyager also found nitrogen in Triton's atmosphere.
Nitrogen makes up 78 percent of Earth's atmosphere.
   On Earth, the northern and southern lights encircle the poles,
but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates
magnetic storms. However, it would be very unusual for an aurora on
Earth to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the
solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines. On
Earth they glow in visible light. Neptune's lights glow ultraviolet
because of hydrogen in its atmosphere.
   Engineers spent the night unloading Voyager's eight-track tape
recorder _ playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during
the Neptune and Triton rendezvous _ and also loaded new instructions
telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors, Urban said.
   Voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of
Triton, which is four-fifth's the size of Earth's moon. But pictures
returned Friday were more than enough to stun scientists.
   ``The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author
Carl Sagan said Friday. ``We are almost certainly in a regime of
volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane (natural gas).
   The photographs show a cracked, frozen Triton scarred by
thousand-foot-high ridges, fault lines, bowl-shaped craters,
mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far
defy explanation.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' Voyager project scientist Edward Stone said
Friday at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Icy volcanic flows have been seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some
other moons, but Triton is the first place scientists have actually
seen ice volcanoes, Stone said. Photographs showed at least three
inactive volcanoes.
   NASA geologist Joseph Boyce said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across. Some were encircled with cliffs 1,000
to 2,000 feet high.
   The properties of exotic ices of water, methane and nitrogen
``are very different from ordinary ice,'' said Sagan, a member of
the Voyager imaging team. ``That may explain the exoticness of the
landforms.''
   Parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment
of radiation that produced chemical changes, Sagan said. ``We've got
pink snow. Think about how exotic that is.''
   Preliminary measurements of Triton's magnetic field suggest that
it does not have a north pole and a south pole like Earth's magnetic
field, but rather multiple poles, researchers said.
   Robert Strom of the Voyager imaging team said the relative
scarcity of craters on Triton tends to confirm speculation that
Triton originated outside the solar system and became captured by
Neptune's gravity, perhaps after colliding with one of its moons.
   Voyager also revealed that Triton has an atmosphere and is
covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog.
   On the moon's sunlit southern hemisphere, frozen methane or other
volatile material is boiling off the surface, causing haze, and
condensing on the moon's cooler regions, scientists said.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look
back at Neptune. Then it will head toward interstellar space.
   Weary NASA scientists, many of whom spent all night at the
laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft, gushed over
the spectacular images being received.
   Laurence Soderblom of the Voyager imaging team said: ``Wow! What
a way to leave the solar system.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday marked the 50th
anniversary of the outbreak of World War II by condemning Nazism and
Marxism as ``substitute religions'' and hailing democratic reform in
his native Poland.
   The pontiff singled out Poland while expressing support for the
right of people to determine their own governments. Poland last week
installed the first non-Communist government leader in the East Bloc.
   John Paul made his appeals in a 20-page apostolic letter marking
the Sept. 1 anniversary of the start of the war and a 12-page
message to Polish bishops on the same subject.
   In the official English translation of the letter, the pope said
in it was ``our duty before God'' to remember the war in order to
honor its victims, forgive the offenses committed, and reflect on
its causes.
   ``We have a duty to learn from the past so that never again will
there arise a set of factors capable of triggering a similar
conflagration,'' he said in the apostolic letter, according to an
official English-language text.
   He traced Nazi atrocities to its denial of God and law, which he
said led to the crushing of human rights and eventually the rights
of nations.
   ``Nazi paganism and Marxist dogma are both basically totalitarian
ideologies and tend to become substitute religions,'' he wrote in
one of his harshest condemnations yet of communism.
   Focusing on his native land, John Paul said Poland was on the
winning side of the war but that under Communist rule, Poles ``were
forced to ask themselves whether they in fact being treated as the
vanquished'' and were compelled ``to undertake new struggles.
   ``For in truth, a state whose society is not sovereign is no
sovereign state at all,'' the pope said in the message to Polish
bishops.
   John Paul was apparently referring to the campaign of the
Solidarity labor movement that culminated last week with the
appointment of a non-Communist as prime minister.
   At a news conference to release the papal documents, Cardinal
Roger Etchegaray said the pope was holding up Poland as an example.
   ``He knows very well that the Polish experience isn't limited to
a national reality but can also be applied to other situations,
above all in Europe,'' said the French cardinal, head of the
Vatican's Council for Justice and Peace.
   But asked whether the pope was advocating democracy for Eastern
Europe and the Baltic states, Etchegaray said, ``One should not
imagine that the pope tries to revise pacts, to revise Poland's
borders.''
   In his statements, the pope also made a special appeal for an end
to discrimination.
   He singled out the Nazi slaughter of the Jews as something
``which will forever remain a shame for humanity.''
   About 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
   Jews and Catholics are now embroiled in a dispute over a Catholic
convent at the site of the Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
   Jewish groups are outraged at the Polish church's refusal to move
the convent as promised. They say the convent and its Christian
symbols are insults to the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died
there.
   Asked why the pope had not intervened, Etchegaray said: ``Knowing
the degree to which the pope respects the local churches ... the
pope shows himself even more respectful of the local church he comes
from.''

<HEAD>At Least 36 Killed in Sinhalese Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>

   At least 20 people were shot and killed
in a central Sri Lankan village, military officals said Saturday,
and residents accused soldiers of carrying out the killings.
   Up to 16 more people were killed in various attacks during the
past 24 hours, officials said.
   All the victims of Friday's attack in Tirapanne, 100 miles
northeast of Colombo, were Sinhalese and their bodies were thrown in
six houses that were later burned, said military officials, who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   Residents in Anuradhapura, 12 miles from Tirapanne, blamed the
attack on soldiers in civilian clothes and said they apparently
meant to avenge the slayings of a fellow soldier's parents. The
residents, contacted by telephone, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Pro-government vigilante groups and the military have been
accused in the past of killing civilians during operations against
Sinhalese extremists. The government denies the charge.
   An opposition lawmaker, Janak Mahendra Adikari, said in
Anuradhapura that the Tirapanne toll could be much higher. He said
hundreds of villagers had fled to Anuradhapura.
   In another attack Friday, men in military uniforms burned six or
seven homes in Katukeliyawa, 15 miles south of Anuradhapura, said
Adikari, contacted by telephone.
   ``There are reports of five to six civilian casualties in this
attack, but we do not have confirmation,'' he said. The military
could not immediately confirm the attack.
   The government armed the military with sweeping powers under
emergency laws to curb an anti-government campaign by the Sinhalese
extremists belonging to the People's Liberation Front.
   The front stepped up its campaign of assassinations and strikes
after President Ranasinghe Premadasa imposed a nationwide state of
emergency June 20. The government says at least 1,000 people have
died since July 15.
   In their latest attack, radicals detonated a bomb under a police
vehicle in Kurunegala district Friday, killing three policemen and a
civilian driver, the military officials said.
   One laborer traveling in the vehicle also was killed and five
policemen were injured in the blast about 85 miles northeast of
Colombo, the officials said.
   They said two policemen and a wildlife official were killed
Friday in an ambush of their vehicle in Anuradhapur district, which
carries the same name as its largest town.
   A naval officer, a front member and three civilians were killed
in separate incidents during the past 24 hours in southern Sri
Lanka, the officials said. One unidentified body also was found they
said.
   At least 5,000 people have died in the Sinhalese extremist
campaign, launched in July, 1987 to protest the government's peace
overtures to Tamil separatists in the northeast.
   The radicals said the government gave too many concessions to the
minority Tamil community in an India-sponsored peace plan of June
29, 1987, that aimed to end the six-year Tamil demand for an
independent nation.
   Sinhalese radicals also were angered by the deployment of Indian
peacekeeping soldiers in the northeast, invited to enforce the June,
1987, accord. They said the Indian presence compromised the
country's sovereignty.
   The accord collapsed when the strongest Tamil rebel group
rejected it, and began attacking Indian troops. At least 1,000
Indian soldiers have died in the fighting. More than 10,000 Sri
Lankans have been killed in the six-year separatist war.
   Tamils, who form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
allege discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese
majority who make up 75 percent of the population.
   The Sinhalese control the government and the military.
   India became involved in the ethnic problems of its small
southeastern neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60
million Tamils.

<HEAD>Refugees Pour Across Europe's Borders in Biggest Migration in Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people
are streaming across European borders in one of the largest
migrations in years, many using new travel freedoms to seek out old
homelands.
   East Germans are flooding into West Germany, Moscow is granting
some Soviet Jews their long-time wish to emigrate, and ethnic Turks
have fled in record numbers to Turkey from virtual persecution in
Bulgaria.
   One immigration expert says the border-blurring flood may be the
biggest mass movement of Europeans since after World War II. The
bulk of the migration has been from the East bloc to the West, with
many taking advantage of looser travel restrictions to escape
stagnant economies.
   About 400,000 ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union and five other
Eastern European countries are expected in West Germany this year.
That marks an emotional homecoming for the descendants of settlers
who themselves sought a better life by heading eastward decades,
even centuries ago.
   ``I myself left the German Democratic Republic in 1952,'' says
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of the new
arrivals from that Communist nation. ``I know what's driving these
people on, and I know that no one makes a snap decision to flee.''
   The number of East Germans reaching West Germany this year is
expected to hit 100,000, the highest number since 207,000 people
arrived in 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built.
   So far in 1989, the majority of the East Germans leaving behind a
growing sense of hopelessness in their bleak, pollution-ridden
country are emigrating legally.
   But for those leaving without permission, the escapes can range
from a death-defying swim across a Berlin river to a sprint across
the border between Hungary and Austria.
   Many of the refugees are young workers who will be sorely missed
back in East Germany, a country of 16.6 million. On Saturday alone,
more than 100 East Germans crossed illegally into Austria,
authorities said.
   East Germany intensified a media campaign aimed at stemming the
flow of refugees to the West. The Communist Party daily, Neues
Deutschland, printed 23 letters it said it received from readers
criticizing West German media coverage of the exodus and warning
East Germans of an uncertain future in the West.
   ``The West German media has become hysterical,'' the newspaper
quoted a man identified as Hans-Dieter Stuck. ``They want to
hoodwink young and old into giving up home and hearth.''
   West Germany is the promised land for another current wave of
European migrants _ ethnic Germans whose ancestors settled in what
is now the Soviet Union and other parts of Eastern Europe
generations ago.
   ``Last year, we had 200,000 and this year we are counting on
400,000,'' says Ina Ruehl, an expert with the West German Red Cross
in Bonn.
   The numbers she cited reflect the new arrivals from the Soviet
Union, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
   ``After the war, it was 12 million people. That was the largest
movement,'' Ms. Ruehl said, referring to the exodus of Germans from
Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Nazis' Third Reich.
``So, this is really the second-biggest such movement.''
   By comparison, up until 1987 only about 600 ethnic Germans were
allowed to emigrate from their homes in the harsh climes of Siberia
and Soviet Central Asia.
   ``Emigration is regarded by many as the only possibility to
remain Germans, to preserve their traditions, language and
culture,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass said Aug. 17,
summing up the views of a new organization representing the
minority's interests.
   Last week, the head of the Soviet Union's visa agency said that
due to eased travel restrictions, 200,000 Soviets are expected to
emigrate this year. Rudolf Kuznetsov said about 107,000 Soviets
already have received permission to leave this year. Most of the
emigrants go to the United States and West Germany.
   The Soviets have begun to open the gates for the estimated 1.8
million to 3 million Jews demanding the right to emigrate. Since
1971, about 300,000 Soviet Jews have left.
   Thousands have made their way to Italy by way of Vienna, hoping
to eventually reach the United States. But while the United States
used to welcome the Soviet Jews with open arms, that policy was
tightened in October.
   The ethnic Turks streaming out of Bulgaria are leaving behind
official harassment bordering on outright persecution.
   Bulgarian authorities have embarked on an assimiliation campaign,
forcing the ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names. The ethnic Turks say
they have been fined and beaten for speaking Turkish in public and
for practicing Islamic rites.
   The number had climbed to more than 300,000 in three months
before Ankara began clamping down last week in hopes of forcing
concessions from Bulgaria's Communist authorities.
   About 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have fled
to Hungary over the past two years. The ethnic Hungarians also
demand the right to use their language, and maintain their cultural
traditions are violated.
   Hungary's willingness to take in the refugees _ and Budapest's
championing of their rights _ have worsened the already strained
relations between the two Warsaw Pact allies.
   Sheer economic need often remains the greatest force for massive
internal migrations within Europe, demonstrated by the millions of
Turks, Italians, Spaniards and others who have found work in
northern European countries over the last few decades.

   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
has decided to make sure dissenting voices are heard when the new
denomination makes a pronouncement on a controversial social issue.
   The church approved a policy of recognizing substantial minority
views Friday in a session that also affirmed membership in the
sometimes controversial National Council of Churches and World
Council of Churches. The ecumenical organizations include most major
Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churches in this country and around
the world.
   The method of handling church pronouncements, including dissent,
came in the adoption of a document detailing the basis for speaking
out on moral issues in society.
   Delegates narrowly approved an amendment offered by Christa Klein
of York, Pa., providing that whenever significant division is shown
in approving social pronouncements, summaries will be given of
dissenting positions.
   The Rev. Frank Lay of Oregon, Ill., argued this would ``reduce
the force'' of statements and the Rev. L. Edward Knudson of
Milwaukie, Ore., contended it would ``take away impact and meaning.''
   However, the Rev. Douglas Johnson of Spring Grove, Pa., said
``intelligent and moral honesty'' demanded that there be room in the
church for those who differ and that this should be openly
recognized.
   ``As a parish pastor, this is one of the problems I have
struggled with when a stand is taken with which someone doesn't
agree,'' he said.
   The provision was approved by a 489-453 vote.
   Lengthy debate preceded the vote for membership of the
5.3-million denomination, fourth-largest among U.S. Protestants, in
the National Council of Churches. The council has been involved in
leadership conflicts and financial strains and is undergoing
structural reforms.
   Bishop Glenn Nycklemoe of the Southeastern Minnesota Synod, based
in Rochester, Minn., said he had reversed his opposition to
belonging to the council, sensing ``new directions and new spirit''
in it.
   Of the three Lutheran bodies merged into the denomination, the
former Lutheran Church in America had belonged to the national
council, but not the former American Lutheran Church or former
Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   The eight-day assembly, which runs through next Wednesday, also
adopted working guidelines for ecumenical efforts for Christian
unity.
   Citing the biblical and theological bases for it, the 5,000-word
document urges work for ``the oneness to which God calls the world
in the saving gift of Jesus Christ.
   ``It also means to recognize the brokenness of the church in
history and the call of God, especially in this century, to heal
this disunity of Christ's people.''

   Police arrested 30 people in
Cape Town on Saturday during two protests against a controversial
rugby tour by a squad of international all-stars.
   The demonstrations, held hours before the start of a match, were
part of a nationwide anti-apartheid campaign launched Aug. 2 to
protest segregation and the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, which
exclude the black majority.
   In other developments, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu sent
letters to four Western leaders, including President Bush,
describing the almost daily unrest this month in black and
mixed-race townships outside Cape Town.
   And the country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federations
met near Johannesburg to discuss strategies for opposing laws that
limit worker rights.
   Twenty eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel in Cape Town
after meeting briefly with Willie John McBride, manager of the
international squad made up of Australian, French and British
players.
   Several demonstrators carried posters that read ``Mercenaries Go
Home'' and ``Apartheid Tour Must Stop.''
   Two activists also were arrested when about 30 protesters
gathered outside the main Cape Town branch of First National Bank,
sponsor of the rugby tour. Bank officials said they have received
several bomb threats in recent days.
   The activists were identified as Dawood Khan, a spokesman for the
Western Cape Traders Association, and Willie Hofmeyer, a leader of
the banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition.
   Police on Friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour. The
international team's visit has been denounced by activists as a
breach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid.
   The International XV squad, whose tour was approved by the
International Rugby Board, already has played two matches in South
Africa. But Saturday's contest was the first against the South
African national squad, the Springboks.
   Rugby is the most popular team sport among white South Africans,
who believe their squad would be the best in the world if allowed to
compete regularly on an international level.
   Saturday's match, which the Springboks won 20-19, marked the
first international competition for the South African team since a
New Zealand team made an unsanctioned ``rebel tour'' in 1986.
   In most sports, the world governing bodies have barred South
Africans from international competition because of apartheid.
However, the degree of sanctions varies in each sport.
   South Africa has not been allowed to compete in the Olympics
since 1960, and generally its amateur teams have difficulty playing
abroad or attracting visitors. In professional sports, South Africa
often lures foreign competitors with huge sums of money in cricket,
boxing, golf and tennis.
   British cricket players have agreed to a tour in January even
though they will face an automatic five-year suspension from
international competition. South Africa also stages an annual golf
tournament with a $1 million first prize _ the largest of any
tournament _ and consistenly draws top players.
   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, declined to release details of the
letters. But he said Tutu mailed them to Bush, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterand and
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The clashes between activists and police have escalated steadily
since the launch of the defiance campaign and police blamed two
deaths Friday on rioters.
   The two labor federations that met Saturday _ the Congress of
South African Trade Unions with 900,000 members, and the smaller
National Council of Trade Unions _ have said they make take protest
action before the elections.
   Gen. Hennie de Witt, the police commissioner, imposed tight
restrictions on the meetings, allowing only union members to attend,
prohibiting political banners, and restricting discussions to labor
issues.
   Dozens of police armed with shotguns and tear gas were present at
the meeting attended by 800 delegates.

<TEXT>
   Six centuries after the Ottoman Turks
launched their conquest of the Balkans from this city, Bursa is
bursting with refugees fleeing part of the old empire.
   This city of ancient mosques and modern factories has become a
symbol of Turkey's problems in dealing with a flood of ethnic Turks
migrating from Bulgaria to escape a campaign to erase their culture.
   Since mid-May, 310,000 ethnic Turks have arrived from Bulgaria in
one of the largest mass movements of people since World War II.
   The difficulties prompted Turkey to impose a visa requirement
last week to curtail the immigration.
   The ethnic Turks say they are escaping a forced assimilation
campaign aimed at changing their Moslem names to Slavic ones, wiping
out use of the Turkish language and halting the practice of Islamic
rites.
   Like immigrants the world over, the Bulgarian Turks flooded into
areas where earlier arrivals had established communities. Bursa, 150
miles southwest of Istanbul, received the largest group, an
estimated 75,000.
   ``Enough,'' said Mayor Teoman Ozalp in an interview. ``In three
months the city population rose by 10 percent. We cannot cope with
it, no city in the world can cope with it.''
   Immigrants, residents and city officials say the major problem is
housing.
   Many immigrants have gone to stay with relatives, who are putting
up as many as 15 or 20 newcomers in their three-room houses.
   About 20,000 immigrants have been given shelter in schools. But
they will have to be evacuated shortly in preparation for the start
of classes Sept. 18.
   In the shade at a schoolyard, Ismail Sukruoglu Oren spoke of his
problems since arriving from Bulgaria four days earlier. The welder
had just gotten a job but was unable to find a home for his family.
   ``It was hell there, but it is trouble here, too,'' he said.
   Immigrants say that when they do find work, they get less than
the minimum wage.
   For residents, the problems have mounted too. Bursa natives
complain that some employers are firing workers to hire cheaper
immigrant labor. They say rents have doubled and tripled since the
arrival of the ethnic Turks.
   According to Mumin Gencoglu, head of the Balkan Immigrants
Association, lack of organization by the government has exacerbated
the problem.
   ``What are farmers doing in this industrial city?'' he asked.
``The government should have divided people according to their
professions and sent them to areas where there are jobs or land
available for farming.''
   Prefabricated houses should have been constructed immediately, he
said.
   The government has promised to give $150 a month to each family
for rent beginning next month.
   ``But there are no houses for rent. We already had a housing
shortage when they started coming,'' says Mayor Ozalp.
   The government tried to send the ethnic Turks to different parts
of the country, but the orders were not mandatory.
   ``We have lost track of 100,000 arrivals,'' said the minister in
charge of the immigrants, Ercument Konukman. ``They did not go where
they were sent. We believe most went to Bursa or Istanbul.''
   Even critics of the government admit that no one expected so many
Bulgarian Turks streaming in from the Balkans, which was part of the
Ottoman Empire. Bursa was the capital of that empire in the 14th
century.
   The mass migration began when Bulgaria expelled leaders of a
protest against the 5-year-old assimilation campaign. Bulgaria then
began issuing passports that allowed ethnic Turks to leave with a
few suitcases and bundles of household goods _ unleashing a flood of
emigration to Turkey.
   Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal initially said he was prepared to
admit all of Bulgaria's estimated 1.5 million ethnic Turks. Offers
of jobs and housing poured in from around the country, and the first
100,000 arrivals were handled relatively smoothly.
   But Turkey miscalculated, believing Bulgaria would not want to
risk labor shortages by allowing a mass emigration of ethnic Turks,
who make up more than 15 percent of Bulgaria's population.
   As of Tuesday, ethnic Turks were allowed in only with visas from
Turkish consulates.
   Ozal has defended the new requirement as necessary to force
Bulgaria into negotiations on an immigration agreement. Turkey is
seeking to control the pace of the exodus and ensure immigrants are
compensated for property left behind and accumulated pension
benefits.
   Turkish officials have pledged to give priority in issuing visas
to divided families, but immigrants are not satisfied.
   ``Now they have no hope, now they will be wiped out as an ethnic
group,'' lamented one, Sabahattin Hatipoglu.

<HEAD>Guam Wants US Reparations for Japanese Damage in WWII</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guam wants the United States to pay millions of
dollars in reparations for the brutal Japanese occupation of the
Pacific island during World War II, a debt the U.S. government
forgave in 1951 for diplomatic reasons.
   ``Although we feel that a moral obligation'' falls on Japan, ``we
cannot seek justice from the Japanese,'' said Joseph F. Ada,
governor of the U.S. territory located only 1,150 miles from Tokyo.
   From 1941-44, Guam suffered through some of the most brutal
treatment ever inflicted on an American community. Survivors recall
massacres, beatings, forced labor and other horrors.
   But the United States ``most unfortunately gave away our right to
reparation from the Japanese in its 1951 peace treaty with Japan ...
without anybody once asking our people,'' according to Ada.
   The Bush administration opposes reparations, saying the U.S.
government spent $8 million immediately after the war on 4,200
death, personal injury and property damage claims.
   ``There is no reason for the American taxpayers to pay further
compensation for World War II claims arising from enemy action,''
said Larry L. Morgan of the Interior Department, which in 1950 took
over responsibility for Guam from the Navy.
   A Guam Reparations Commission appointed this year asked for
compensation totaling $160 million to include payments for deaths,
injuries, forced labor, forced marches or internment.
   The waiver of Japanese reparations, granted early in the Korean
War, ``was a policy decision of the United States to conclude a
quick treaty with Japan ... to turn Japan into a valuable Asian ally
and a bulwark against communist expansion,'' Ada said.
   Ada appeared last month at a hearing on Guam war reparations
legislation introduced by Ben Blaz, Guam's non-voting delegate in
the House of Representatives. The measure faces more hearings and a
possible committee vote later this year.
   The island of 212 square miles _ about one-sixth the size of
Rhode Island _ was acquired from Spain in 1898 after the
Spanish-American War. It remains a key U.S. Pacific military base.
   Japanese still invade Guam, but this time as tourists boosting
the island's main civilian industry, accounting for most of the
500,000 annual visitors to Guam's beaches.
   Blaz and Ada say the new payments are justified in light of $67
million paid in Micronesian war claims and the $20,000 authorized by
Congress for each Japanese-American interned during World War II.
   Too little time was allowed for filing claims after the war and
there was confusion over the eligibility of Guam natives, who
received U.S. citizenship only in 1950, said Blaz.
   Guam senator Eddie Duenas said: ``Apparently, many who were
eligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it or
were too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives.''
   A Guamanian woman, Mrs. Beatrice Perez Emsley, recalled during
the summer hearings that as a girl of 13 she regained consciousness
in a mass grave of decapitated and mutilated Chamorros, native
tribespeople.
   She said a Japanese soldier had tossed her there without
realizing that his attempt to behead her had failed because he used
a bayonet instead of sword.
   ``I could not breathe from the pain in my neck and head and the
dirt was beginning to choke me ... I had to bear the pain and keep
still or else those Japanese soldiers would stab me or shoot me,''
she said.
   Mrs. Emsley, now 58, said she finally crawled into the jungle and
wandered for a week until another Guamanian fugitive found her.
Years later, they met members of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division who
were liberating the island.
   Reparations ``will not remove from us the awful memories of the
horrors we witnessed or experienced,'' she said, but they ``will
show us just that somebody cares about what happened to us.''
   Duenas, the senator, said that the United States made death
payments ranging as low as $221 and high as $3,500 to 750 people on
Guam after the war.
   Island residents maintain that 8 percent to 10 percent of the
population, or up to 2,000 people, were killed and 90 percent
suffered severe hardship, injury or disease.
   The Blaz bill contained an initial authorization for $20 million,
specifying $20,000 for the estates of those killed, $15,000 for
personal injury, $10,00 for forced labor and $7,000 for forced march
or internment.

<HEAD>Spanish Leader to Call Early Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will dissolve
Parliament this week and call early elections to coincide with the
seventh anniversary of his Socialist Party's first victory, a
newspaper report said Saturday.
   Analysts said the early elections would allow the Gonzalez to
take advantage of favorable results in European Parliamentary
elections, disarray among opposition groups, and a strong economy.
   The independent El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper, said the
47-year-old leader would dissolve Parliament on Sept. 2 and set
elections for Oct. 29. An election had been scheduled for June 1990
at the latest.
   The paper cited unidentified government sources for its report.
   Gonzalez would be seeking an unprecedented third term for the
Socialists.
   On Oct. 28, 1982, the Socialists won a landslide victory in
elections to gain their first Parliamentary majority in the history
of Spanish democracy. They won another majority in June 1986.
   The analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Gonzalez's party could benefit from the June elections across
Western Europe, when Socialists won 39.5 percent of the vote for the
European Parliament.
   They said the prime minister also was taking advantage of a
strong economy and the breakdown of an alliance between the
conservative Popular Party and the centrist Social Democratic Center.
   The Socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of
Parliament. The Popular Party holds 91, the Social Democratic Center
has 28, and the rest of the seats are controlled by several smaller
parties.
   In addition, the analysts pointed out that Spain's economy has
grown by 4.5 percent annually for the past three years, setting a
European record.
   Early elections could also disrupt the momentum of the leading
socialist and communist labor unions, whose leaders have hinted at
strike action later this year.

   Two men assaulted a screenwriter who is
leading a campaign against direct distribution of U.S. films in this
country, authorities said Saturday.
   Lee Jung-ui, 45, was hospitalized for head injuries after two
unidentified men attacked him with rocks Friday in front of his
house in Seoul, police said.
   Lee blamed the attack on critics of his new job as head of an
organization opposed to direct distribution of U.S. films in South
Korea by the Hollywood-based United International Pictures, police
said.
   Lee told police he confronted two men in their 20s while
returning home from an outing with his son. He said the attackers
hit him on the head with rocks after asking, ``Aren't you Mr. Lee
Jung-ui?''
   Police were still looking for the attackers.
   On Aug. 13, six theaters in Seoul showing films distributed by
the American company, including ``Rain Man'' and ``Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade,'' were attacked with firebombs and tear gas.
   Police said they were searching for a movie producer as a main
suspect in the theater attacks.
   Actors and other members of the South Korean film industry have
said competition from the U.S.-distributed films could wreck the
local industry.
   A trade law adopted last year allowed U.S. companies to bypass
South Korean distributors by distributing directly to cinemas.

   An insurance salesman whose phone
number was mistakenly listed in a pizza ad says even though he makes
a pretty good home-cooked pizza, he isn't ready to deliver.
   Hank Foiles says his telephone has been going non-stop since
Pizza Hut mailed out an ad last week to thousands of homes.
   Calls from hungry customers began Thursday night, but they didn't
hit a peak until Friday afternoon.
   ``Since 4:30, there's been a call about every two minutes,''
Foiles said Friday. Not one was a personal call.
   He said Pizza Hut had assured him the problem would be corrected,
but company officials declined to comment.
   Pizza Hut offered to put an answering machine on Foiles' line to
refer callers to the correct number, he said. In the meantime,
friends trying to reach Foiles will have to rely on his business
telephone line.
   ``The manager told me, `If you want to leave for the weekend and
go somewhere else and check in, we'll take care of it for you,'''
Foiles said. ``They offered to keep me and my friends in pizza for a
year, or me for life.''
   But Foiles said he likes his own home-cooked pizza just fine.

   A vintage steam locomotive, whose last run 36
years ago almost led to the scrapyard, will return to the rails next
month.
   Engine No. 290 is ready for a new assignment, hauling tourists
and railroad buffs on trips around the city and beyond.
   The inaugural run between Atlanta and Macon is set for Sept. 10.
   The thunder of the engine's 6-foot driving wheels hasn't been
heard in decades, since No. 290 pulled the crack Crescent Limited
passenger train between Atlanta and Montgomery. So steam buffs are
hailing the restored engine's pending debut as a chapter in a battle
against indifference, rust and neglect.
   ``I grew up in the steam era, and to see her back under steam is
going to be an accomplishment,'' said Charlie Strike, president of
the Atlanta chapter of the National Railway Historical Society _ now
the engine's owner.
   ``I don't know any kid, young or old, that doesn't get a rise out
of seeing a steam engine thundering by,'' he said.
   Restoration of No. 290 has been a joint effort of the society and
the Georgia Building Authority, which mostly manages state office
buildings but also runs the ``New Georgia Railroad,'' offering
regularly scheduled trips around the city and to state-owned Stone
Mountain over existing, commercial tracks.
   Once No. 290 is under steam, the engine will alternate with New
Georgia's other steam engine _ the smaller and older No. 750 _ and
its stable of four diesels in providing front-end power for trips.
   Built in 1926, No. 290 was slated for the scrap heap when the
diesel age dawned in earnest following World War II. The engine's
last run was in 1953.

   President Bush called French
President Francois Mitterrand on Saturday to discuss coordinating
economic aid for Poland and keeping international attention focused
on peace efforts in Lebanon.
   ``President Bush expressed his concern about the general
situation in Lebanon and reiterated U.S. support for efforts by the
Arab League to resolve the issue,'' according to a statement issued
by the vacation White House.
   A fleet of French warships remained off Lebanon for a possible
evacuation of French citizens.
   ``The two presidents commented on the U.N. (United Nations)
cease-fire in Lebanon and agreed to keep the U.N. spotlight on the
problem.''
   On the subject of Poland, the statement said that the two
presidents discussed the election last week of Solidarity activist
Tadeusz Mazowiecki as Poland's prime minister ``and agreed to
continue offering the support of their two goverments.''
   ``Both presidents want to encourage the new government, while
keeping in mind the delicacy of the situation,'' the statement said.
   The Bush administration has promised Poland $119 million in U.S.
economic aid and is supporting some $325 million in new loans from
international lending agencies.
   The White House statement, quoting Bush directly, said he told
Mitterrand, ``We want to help Poland in a coordinated way. They need
an effective reform program that takes on the economic realities
they face.''
   Vacationing here through Labor Day, Bush also entertained
evangelist Billy Graham on Saturday.
   The president started the day pursuing one of his favorite
vacation activities, ocean fishing. He took out his speed boat
Fidelity in hopes of succeeding where he has so far failed on his 10
days in this coastal resort town. Earlier, he played tennis at his
home on Walker's Point.
   Evening plans called for Bush and his wife Barbara to entertain
some 35 relatives who live in the Kennebunkport area.
   Bush's son Jeb from Florida and his wife and children also were
visiting.
   By Saturday, the president had yet to catch a fish despite daily
excursions onto the water. On Friday his Secret Service body guards
agreed to keep their protective boats and the media chase boats
further away so as not to scare away a prospective catch.
   Graham and his wife were the latest in a stream of guests at
Walker's Point since Bush's arrival Aug. 16. The Grahams and Bushes
were expected to attend church services together Sunday.
   All of the president's five children and their families have been
on hand for several days. The Bushes this past week entertained
Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter and his wife Anne Marie for an
overnight visit.
   In addition, several friends have joined the president for golf,
dinner and tennis.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is scheduled to arrive
here Wednesday for what is billed as a personal, social occasion
rather than a working visit.
   Bush has been receiving daily intelligence briefings while on
vacation and has conducted routine business, but mostly spends his
time at golf, tennis, running and boating.

   Railroad workers heeded a call by
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to end a one-day strike today, but
they sent an appeal to Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki asking him
to satisfy their pay demands.
   The conclusion of the strike at one minute after midnight Friday
followed Walesa's appeal that the new prime minister be allowed to
start work with the support of all Poles. The independent trade
union leader said Mazowiecki's election was a ``breakthrough'' not
to be wasted.
   Walesa also suggested Friday that the strike by the railway
workers in Lodz, the country's second-largest city located in
central Poland, could be a ``provocation'' against Mazowiecki, who
this week took office as head of the first non-communist government
in the East bloc.
   ``We trust that as premier you represent the interests of the
working people and you will take immediately decisions satisfying
our demands,'' the workers said in announcing the end of the strike.
The statement was carried on PAP, the state news agency.
   Abandoning the strike, they said, was ``proof of our support and
trust'' for Mazowiecki.
   The prime minister, who assumed office Thursday in a historic
transfer of power from the Communist Party to a Solidarity-led
coalition, traveled to the southern shrine city of Czestochowa today
to take part in annual ceremonies honoring the Black Madonna,
Poland's most revered icon.
   He planned meetings with various political leaders as he began
the task of assembling his Cabinet.
   In his first meeting with a top Soviet official, the prime
minister met in Warsaw with Vladimir Kryuchkov, the chief of the
Soviet KGB who is on a working visit to Poland, said Ryszard
Wojtkowski, acting as Mazowiecki's spokesman.
   The meeting was private and its agenda was not known. Beforehand,
Kryuchkov spoke with several of Poland's top Communist officials.
   The Soviet Union has generally approved the dramatic political
changes in Poland. However, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda
today said that while Polish Communists may have suffered a defeat,
nobody should write their political obituary. The article appeared
to be a warning to Polish radicals.
   With the Mazowiecki's election, Pravda said, ``Extremist-minded
people are hurrying to write off the Polish United Workers Party
because, they argue, it has finally found itself in isolation,
abandoned by its associates.''
   That would be premature, Pravda cautioned. In fact, it said, the
Communists by right are the most important group in Polish politics.
   Mazowiecki met Friday with emissaries from the superpowers,
including U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Soviet Ambassador
Vladimir Brovikov.
   After the meeting, Mrs. Dole said Washington will consider new
ways to help Poland, but she did not mention financial aid beyond
the $119 million President Bush offered during a July visit.
   Solidarity leaders have been hoping for a $10 billion from the
West, and Walesa said the West would be to blame if Poland's new
government failed for lack of financial aid.
   ``Obviously, we do have a budget deficit at home,'' Mrs. Dole
said. ``We will provide aid as we can, when we can, but there is
already a very significant program under way.''
   She said Bush soon will send U.S. experts to Poland to study how
they can help.
   Her husband, Senate Minority leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., and
three Democrats, Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Rep. Jim Moody
of Wisconsin and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, also attended the meeting.
   Dole said Mazowiecki told him: ```He who helps early, helps
twice.' In other words, this is very important now to keep up the
momentum and let the Polish people see some change.''
   Walesa, who convinced Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski to
support the Solidarity-led government, said Friday that Mazowiecki's
selection was the ``breakthrough'' needed to stop Poland's economic
decline.
   But to succeed, Poland needs financial help _ and much more than
the West has offered so far, Walesa said Friday on ABC's ``20-20.''
   ``I will say that if we fail, we can blame the world, even the
United States, that you haven't contributed with cooperation in
these conditions of civilization development; you will be to blame
for Polish failure,'' he said.
   In a show of support unthinkable just a few months ago, Communist
Party chief Miezcyslaw F. Rakowski interrupted an official visit to
Bulgaria to send Mazowiecki a telegram Friday promising the party's
support ``in everything aiming at leading the country out of the
crisis.''
   Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov met with Mazoiecki and
congratulated him on his election by the Sejm, the lower house of
the National Assembly. Mazowiecki sent greetings to the Soviet
people, a government spokesman said.

   The defendant wriggled in his chair,
hiking his elbows onto the armrests. He crossed his arms when he
stood before the judge, who called him Mr. Kocher and told him he
had been charged with shooting a 7-year-old girl in the back with a
hunting rifle.
   Cameron Kocher pleaded innocent, moving closer to becoming
apparently the youngest person ever in the country to be tried on an
adult homicide charge. He is 10.
   The boy let out a heavy sigh as he turned to his parents, Keith
and Patricia Kocher, after his arraignment ended Friday.
   Prosecutors have ruled out the death penalty if the the
fourth-grader is convicted. Mark Pazuhanich, a Monroe County
assistant district attorney, said life in prison remains a
possibility, though he hasn't decided yet what punishment he would
seek. No trial date has been set.
   Cameron's lawyer said prosecutors, who fought a request to move
the case to juvenile court, should realize they are not dealing with
``a miniature adult.''
   ``He doesn't understand the concept of murder and doesn't fully
understand the concept of death,'' Charles Hansford said after the
arraignment. ``I don't know how to prepare him.''
   Cameron is charged with killing a playmate, first-grader Jessica
Carr. She died March 6, two months before Cameron's 10th birthday,
after she was shot as she rode on the back of a snowmobile.
   Schools were closed that day because of heavy snow. Cameron,
Jessica, 13-year-old Shannon Ratti and other children were spending
the day playing video games at Shannon's house in Kresgeville, a
town of 250 people in the foothills of the Pocono Mountains.
   After Shannon's father, Richard Ratti, found dirty dishes in the
house, he put the video games off limits, and the children went
outside to ride snowmobiles. But Cameron's parents had told him not
to ride snowmobiles when they weren't around, and he left the house
angry and went to his home next door, Ratti testified.
   The boy said the shooting was an accident while he was playing
with a gun. But investigators gave this account of what happened
next, ticking off a list of deliberate steps that the judge cited in
his decision to have the boy tried as an adult:
   Cameron took a key from under a lamp in his parents' bedroom and
opened his father's gun cabinet, took out a .35-caliber Marlin
lever-action hunting rifle his father had taught him to shoot, and
loaded it.
   After unlocking a bedroom window and opening it, Cameron took out
the screen and set it aside, and he pointed the rifle out the
window, investigators said.
   At 1:05 p.m. a shot rang out, and Jessica, about 100 yards away,
fell from the back of the snowmobile Shannon was driving.
   The rifle's recoil slammed the scope into Cameron's face, cutting
his forehead. Cameron put the rifle back in the cabinet, bandaged
his forehead and hid a spent shell casing.
   Fearing a sniper was on the loose, Ratti called Cameron and told
him to come back to his house for safety. Ratti's wife, Trudy,
testified that Cameron explained the bandage on his forehead by
saying he cut himself with a knife when a dog jumped on him as he
made a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich.
   As others frantically tried to help Jessica, Cameron sat on the
Rattis' floor and resumed playing the video game, Ratti testified.
Cameron kept playing the game while the other children prayed and
made get-well cards for the girl.
   ``If you don't think about it, you won't be sad,'' Ratti quoted
Cameron as saying.
   The girl was pronounced dead about an hour after she was shot.
Cameron was arrested two days later after investigators found his
blood on the rifle.
   Cameron told psychotherapists he was playing ``hunter'' when he
was looking through the gun's scope and the rifle accidentally
fired. He said he couldn't see anything through the scope but snow
and trees, Dr. Robert Sadoff, a psychiatrist who examined Cameron
for the court, has testified.
   A ballistics specialist testified the rifle could not have
discharged accidently unless a severe blow to the rifle forced the
hammer to strike the firing pin.
   Citing Cameron's apparent mental stability, above-average grades
and the deliberate actions he allegedly took before and after the
shooting, Monroe County Judge Ronald Vican in June refused to move
the case from criminal court to juvenile court. Hansford has
appealed.
   Pazuhanich said the case, one of two murders in the county this
year, troubles him.
   ``I'm preoccupied with how the boy is reacting to the process.
I'm preoccupied by the tension that's in that neighborhood when you
have the Rattis and the Kochers living side by side and the Carrs
still visit the Rattis and everybody is in close proximity to one
another,'' he said.
   ``You wonder, as I'm sure the Carrs do, what was going through
his head and what to do.''

   Prince Aya, Emperor Akihito's second son, has
received his parents' approval to wed a graduate student he has been
seeing for four years, Japanese news media reported Saturday.
   Though palace and government officials avoided official comment,
nearly all major newspapers and television networks said Prince Aya,
23, second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, would wed Kiko
Kawashima, 22.
   Miss Kawashima is a graduate psychology student at Tokyo's
Gakushuin University, where she met the prince.
   She and her parents visited the royal Akasaka Palace in central
Tokyo on Friday night, sparking speculation that an engagement
announcement is imminent.
   Kyodo News Service said Shoichi Fujimori, the chief palace
official, acknowledged that Emperor Akihito instructed him Saturday
morning to begin official preparations for the engagement.
   The 10-member Imperial Council, headed by Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu, must approve the engagement and is expected to discuss the
matter after Kaifu returns Sept. 10 from an official visit to the
United States, Canada and Mexico.
   No date has been set for the wedding, but it is not expected
before January, when the official mourning period ends for the
Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito. He died of cancer Jan. 7.

   Media magnate Rupert Murdoch says
British television is overrated, obsessed with the past and badly in
need of competition.
   Murdoch, whose holdings include the Fox television network in the
United States as well as newspapers and magazines in several
countries, recently ventured into British television with Sky
Channel, received by subscribers on satellite dishes.
   In a speech Friday at the Edinburgh International Television
Festival, Murdoch said America's most-watched programs are far more
impressive than those in Britain.
   ``Much of what passes for quality on British television is really
no more than a reflection of the values of the narrow elite which
controls it,'' Murdoch said.
   ``But this public-service TV system has had, in my view,
debilitating effects on British society, by producing TV programs
which are often obsessed with class, dominated by anti-commercial
attitudes and with a tendency to hark back to the past.''
   Murdoch's Sky Channel is competing with Britain's four television
channels, two operated by the government's British Broadcasting
Corp. and two by Independent Television. He said television should
be subject to the same laws of supply and demand as newspapers,
journals, magazines, books and feature films.
   ``I believe that a largely market-led television system with
viewers choosing from a wide variety of channels financed in
different ways will produce a better television system than
today's,'' he said, though he did not advocate that the BBC turn to
commercial support.

   About 20 old courtiers and employees at this former royal estate
25 miles from Athens gathered for a Greek Orthodox ceremony
conducted by Father Patrikios Kalliotis, the last surviving priest
to have served the Greek monarchy. A plebiscite abolished the
monarchy in 1974.
   Juan Carlos is married to Paul and Frederika's daughter Sophia.
He last was in Greece when he attended his mother-in-law Frederika's
funeral in February 1981. King Paul died in 1963.
   The Spanish king arrived in Athens on Wednesday to participate in

   Thousands of civil rights demonstrators, men
clad in black, women and children in white, marched quietly upon the
Supreme Court and the Capitol today in a reprise of the NAACP's
historic ``Silent March'' of 1917 in New York City.
   The Washington march was ``concerned with one issue alone _ the
Supreme Court and its recent hostile decisions'' diluting
affirmative action and minority set-aside programs, said Benjamin L.
Hooks, executive director of the NAACP.
   But the tone and style of the protest, led by six drummers with
muffled drums, was fashioned after a march in New York City 72 years
ago to protest segregation and the lynchings of blacks in the South.
On that occasion, W.E.B. DuBois led 8,000 people down Fifth Avenue
in utter silence; that day, too, the men dressed in black and the
women and children in white.
   U.S. Park Police estimated the turnout when the march began at
only 5,000, but revised that figure to 35,000 as the ranks swelled
during the 1{ hour procession to the Capitol from Washington's Mall.
U.S. Capitol Police put the crowd which assembled on the Capitol
grounds at the end of the march at 18,500, according Officer Greg
Nevitt.
   Hooks claimed from the podium that the march had drawn a turnout
of 135,000.
   Each of the marchers carried a printed affirmation which said:
``We march to send a message to all people regardless of race,
color, religion, sex or ethnic orgin, that we will not and cannot
acquiesce quietly as an uncaring Supreme Court majority dismantles
court ruling after court ruling and turns its face toward the dark
past and away from the present and future.''
   And, it said, ``we march proudly in the footsteps of our brave
sisters and brothers from another age who marched 72 years ago in
silent witness against lynching, discrimination, segregation and
racism. For us not to march at this point in time would be a grave
disservice to them.''
   The protest was aimed specifically at four decisions by the court
this year. In the view of civil rights lawyers, the ruling in
Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union sharply limited the previous power
of minorities to sue private parties, including schools, for
discrimatory practices. Similarly, the court's decision in Richmond
vs. J. A. Croson Co. was seen as diluting job set-aside programs and
other affirmative action plans.
   March organizers also assailed the decision in Martin vs. Wilks,
which allowed white firefighters in Birmingham, Ala., to attack a
consent decree calling for the promotion of blacks as a case of
``reverse discrimination.'' The fourth ruling, Ward's Cove vs.
Antonio, was criticized as shifting the entire burden of proof in
job discrimination cases to the victims of employer bias, rather
than requiring employers to demonstrate, at the same time, that
their hiring practices furthered legitimate business interests.
   The march culminated with a rally at the Capitol, where Hooks and
other civil rights leaders were scheduled to speak.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, head of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and mayors Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore and Marion Barry of Washington also were on the program.
   On Friday, Hooks talked about recent incidents of violence
directed at his organization, saying they have ``raised our level of
concern not only for ourselves but for all other institutions and
individuals who traditionally draw the wrath of racists.''
   Several shots were fired July 19 into the NAACP headquarters.
Last Monday, a tear-gas bomb, concealed in a package sent through
the mail, exploded at a regional office in Atlanta.
   ``These are the acts of terrorists,'' Hooks said. ``People could
have been behind those lighted windows in Baltimore, and in Atlanta
several innocent people, including children and the elderly, had to
receive medical care.''
   ``If these acts ... were meant to frighten us or deter us from
any course of action, they failed completely. We did not give in to
terrorism when the Ku Klux Klan was riding high and mighty and we
will not give in to these latter-day terrorists,'' he said.
   ``We are not looking toward bringing vast numbers of people to
Washington,'' Hooks said. ``In this instance, the medium is the
message and the medium is the silent march.''
   The Supreme Court has often been the target of major
demonstrations in the capital in recent years. An estimated 325,000
turned out last spring to urge the court to stand by its 1973
decision legalizing abortion. However, the court weeks later
softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for anti-abortion
forces.

<HEAD>Army Studies Seized Drug Records, Eight Arrests In Candidate Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army officials pored over seized records
from a drug baron's financial empire Saturday and police announced
the arrest of eight more suspects in the killing of a presidential
candidate.
   Army Gen. Ramon Niebles told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview he expected the seized records ``to be of great value in
our campaign'' to wipe out narcotics trafficking.
   Authorities said the records include numbers of local and foreign
bank transactions as well as names of lawyers and others involved in
the financial empire of reputed cocaine kingpin Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha.
   The records were discovered at his rural, bunker-like estate
seized by the army Thursday near the town of Pacho, about 60 miles
north of Bogota.
   ``We are processing these documents, which provide fine
information on the estate,'' said Niebles, commander of the 13th
army brigade.
   He declined to disclose details of the records or anticipate what
actions, such as future raids, they might inspire. According to the
Bogota daily El Tiempo, the records represent the financial books
for Rodriguez Gacha since 1982.
   Rodriguez Gacha _ nicknamed ``The Mexican'' for his affection for
that country's music and culture _ is among the bosses of the
so-called Medellin cartel. Based in the industrial city of Medellin,
the cartel is the world's largest cocaine-trafficking organization
and supplies an estimated 80 percent of the cocaine distributed in
the United States.
   Dozens of luxurious homes, apartments and offices believed owned
by Gacha were among hundreds of properties siezed in an
eight-day-old offensive by police and military forces nationwide.
   The unprecendented crackdown was prompted by the assassination of
a highly popular presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Police in Bogota announced the arrest of eight more suspects in
Galan's killing Aug. 16 at a political rally on Bogota's southern
outskirts, bringing to 13 the total of suspected participants or
accomplices under arrest.
   Five heavily armed men were arrested in a surprise raid last week
at a downtown Bogota apartment. Four of them were identified by more
than a dozen witnesses at the rally.
   Galan's killing capped a 48-hour wave of assassinations,
including that of a national police colonel in Medellin and a
prominent Bogota magistrate. It outraged Colombian society and
inspired the government crackdown, backed by a series of tough
emergency decrees by President Virgilio Barco.
   Barco renewed extradition with the United States, and streamlined
the procedure to reduce the need for extensive judicial review.
Under bloody intimidation by traffickers, the Supreme Court
nullified the extradition treaty in June 1987.
   About 11,000 people have been detained in the government sweep,
including a handful of suspects described by Colombian authorities
as major traffickers or drug-money managers wanted by the United
States.
   Drug and legal experts at the U.S. Embassy were working over the
weekend to try to arrange the extradition of some of the suspects,
sources said, as were Colombian justice officials.
   On Friday, authorities disclosed the arrest in Medellin of
Rodriguez Gacha's alleged finance chief, Luis Fernando Galeano
Berrio. Army officials said he was wanted in the United States on
drug charges.
   They said they also arrested Freddy Rodriguez, a son of Rodriguez
Gacha, and that he also is wanted in the United States, but there
was no immediate U.S. confirmation. American narcotics experts in
Bogota previously have confirmed that three other suspects arrested
in the sweep are wanted by U.S. courts.
   Cartel bosses such as Rodriguez Gacha, Pablo Escobar and Jorge
Ochoa continue to elude authorities.
   According to the Bogota daily El Espectador, Rodriguez Gacha
escaped to Brazil Wednesday in a private aircraft. Local press
reports have placed Escobar, the Medellin cartel's most notorious
leader, in Panama.
   The raids on drug estates have revealed a penchant for the
luxurious, the kinky and the macabre. At one ranch owned by
Rodriguez Gacha soldiers found a wooden gallows, but said they have
no idea if it was ever used.
   Another drug lord's estate featured a two-story stone playhouse
for children built like a medieval castle. Opulent, mirrored
bedrooms with tiger skins, valuable paintings and other works of
art, saunas and indoor swimming pools are common features.
   At a mansion outside Bogota believed to belong to reputed
trafficker Camilo Zapata, the army uncovered a room filled with
articles of withcraft, including potions, dried tigers' feet,
rotting vegetables and fruit and images of Christ immersed in
alcohol.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Jalalabad has been under siege ever since Soviet
troops withdrew early this year. The pressure from guerrillas has
eased somewhat, but Jalalabad remains a city on edge. An Associated
Press reporter visited Jalalabad last week.

<DATELINE>JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As this city tries to return to
normalcy after six months on the front line of the Afghan war, the
frequent boom of heavy weapons serves as a reminder that guerrillas
are still around.
   Schools, shops and factories are open again, but Jalalabad is a
shadow of the legendary garden city beloved by Afghan kings for its
Mediterranean climate and leisurely lifestyle.
   This strategic city on the road from Kabul to Pakistan is
shell-pocked, but officials say the worst is over and there is
widespread longing for peace.
   Since Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan on Feb. 15,
Jalalabad has been the main battleground for the Soviet-backed
government and U.S.-backed guerrillas trying to topple it and set up
an interim government in the city.
   The rebels failed to take Jalalabad, 45 miles from Pakistan,
after nearly 10 weeks of the most intense bombardment of the war in
April and May. Government troops then pushed the guerrillas back
along the main highway that leads to Pakistan, beyond the strategic
crossroads of Samarkhel.
   Local officials took reporters to Samarkhel, nine miles southeast
of Jalalabad, which government forces captured from the guerrillas
in mid-June. It had been the most significant gain of the rebels,
who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic Holy Warriors.
   There were no sounds of gunfire in Samarkhel, and government
soldiers lounged under the few trees seeking shelter from the
noon-day sun and smoking an occasional cigarette.
   On the yellow, shell-pocked wall of a building once used as a
transport office were scrawled the words: ``Interim government of
Afghanistan. The hero mujahedeen of Afghanistan.''
   An arch over the road said: ``Long live the Afghan-Soviet
friendship.''
   Government officials refused to show reporters the Samarkhel
garrison, at the foot of a rocky ridge about 2{ miles away, for what
they said were strategic reasons. Although the government claims its
troops occupy the garrison, the guerrillas claim it is a no-man's
land.
   The ridge itself is the last natural line of defense preventing
the government from moving on the main guerrilla areas nearer to the
Pakistani border. Lt. Gen. Manok Mangall, governor of Nangarhar
province which includes Jalalabad, said ``the important and
significant spots'' were in government hands. But Western reporters
on the trip said they had climbed the ridge recently with the
guerrillas who controlled it.
   The guerrillas say controlling this ridge will enable them to
launch a successful offensive against the Samarkhel-based government
troops once they restock their weapons and ammunition supplies. The
loss of Samarkhel has made it infinitely more difficult for the
guerrillas to accurately launch their main short-range missiles
against Jalalabad and its airport.
   In recent weeks, the airport's gravel runway has been repaired,
and reporters flew to Jalalabad on a fixed-wing Antonov 32 rather
than by helicopter. But the flight was at night, in complete
blackout to minimize risks of a mujahedeen attack.
   Mangall, who is chairman of the Afghan Defense Council, said
there were 12,000 armed guerrillas in Nangarhar now, but two-thirds
were not fighting.
   ``Every night, I am negotiating with two or three (guerrilla)
commanders,'' he said. ``Most of them are tired of war.''
   The highly decorated general said the guerrillas have given up
their plan to transfer their interim government to Jalalabad from
Pakistan, ``and the reconstruction of Jalalabad is accelerating.''
   At Bayazid Roshan University and the Nangarhar teacher's training
institute, which reopened last month after a three-month break,
classes were very small and many classrooms were empty.
   A small nucleus of shops have reopened, but in the crowded
marketplace, three out of four shops remained shuttered, a sign of
continuing uncertainty about the future.
   The sounds of outgoing artillery fire and missiles and even a few
incoming rockets are largely ignored. But the effects of the 840,000
rockets and other heavy artillery which Mangall said had hit
Jalalabad during 42 days at the height of the siege are not
forgotten.
   During a brief shopping tour in the bazaar, 22-year-old Takar,
who lost three members of his family in rocket attacks five months
ago, heard there was an American journalist around and stopped his
bicycle to say:
   ``I hate the American government because they are assisting
opposition groups in our city. They are killing our people. We want
peace to come to Afghanistan.''
   At the teacher's training school, 18-year-old Adilla Dehquanzadeh
said she wanted to ask President Bush why the Americans are arming
the mujahedeen.
   ``If I met him, I would ask him not to equip the opposition with
new weapons, not to kill our innocent people, especially our
children, and to support national reconciliation,'' she said.

<HEAD>Police Say Fighting Diminishing After Soviet Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Christian and Syrian forces battled with
rockets and artillery on Saturday, but a police spokesman said
hostilities have diminished since a Soviet envoy began a peace
mission in the ravaged country.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing rules,
said two people were killed and nine wounded in the clashes. Scores
of shells and rockets crashed in residential neighborhoods on both
sides of Beirut's dividing Green Line.
   The new casualties brought the overal toll to 796 killed and
2,231 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between the
traditionally pro-Western Christians and Syrian troops.
   The spokesman noted that the exchanges were ``limited to two
areas, which reflects the noticeable decrease in the intensity and
scope of the shelling duels'' since Soviet envoy Gennady Tarasov
began his mission on Wednesday.
   It was Moscow's first direct mediation in Lebanon since the civil
war broke out in April 1975.
   Tarasov visited Syria, Moscow's chief Arab ally, where he met
with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa on Wednesday. He drove to
Beirut Thursday and met for two days with Moslem and Christian
leaders, including Gen. Michel Aoun, commander of Christian army
units with whom Syria has refused to negotiate a peace settlement.
   Tarasov, who heads the Middle East Department at the Soviet
Foreign Ministry, returned to Damascus on Friday and was expected to
fly home this weekend for consultations with Kremlin leaders.
   His mission coincided with a French naval buildup off Lebanon.
   Paris said it sent a six-ship flotilla to the Eastern
Mediterranean on a ``humanitarian mission'' to evacuate 7,000 French
nationals if the situation worsens.
   But Syria's Moslem allies and the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, said the move was tantamount to a military
intervention, and vowed to attack any vessel that approaches the
coast.
   After his meeting with Aoun on Friday, Tarasov said the Soviet
Union ``strongly believes there are no military solutions to the
Lebanese problems.''
   Aoun, a spokesman said, expressed to Tarasov his ``full readiness
to cooperate with the Soviet effort.''
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tarasov
was working on ``a formula ... for stabilizing the security
situation and lifting the blockade'' imposed by Syria and its allies
on the 310-square-mile Christian heartland.
   Asked whether Aoun would accept the deployment of observers at
Christian ports to prevent arms supplies form reaching Aoun, as
demanded by the Moslems, the source said: ``Would the other side
accept observers to prevent the flow of weapons from Syria?''
   A Moslem source said the Soviet diplomatic effort ``did not
contradict'' the deployment of French warships in the Mediterranean.
   ``The Soviet effort is the carrot and the French naval buildup is
the stick,'' the source said, also insisting on anonymity.
   He said the French flotilla in the Mediterranean was ``a
message'' to the Syrians and their allies that ``storming the
(Christian) enclave is not permitted.'' He said the Soviets agree
with that.

   High-wire artist Philippe Petit walked a tightrope
soaring over Paris to the second level of the Eiffel Tower on
Saturday, and said later his biggest problem was trying not to have
too much fun.
   With a brisk breeze blowing off the Seine River, Petit leaped
onto the rope at the Palais de Chaillot and walked 2,300 feet on a
cord set at a 16-degree angle to the Eiffel Tower's second level,
330 feet above the sidewalk.
   Thousands of people watched breathlessly as he crossed the length
of more than seven football fields on a wire as thin as three
pencils, occasionally stopping to salute the graceful tower.
   On his balancing bar was a copy of the Declaration of the Rights
of Man, the enduring statement of social justice and liberty that
emerged from the French Revolution in 1789.
   ``My head was full of pure and beautiful things, I felt a
profound joy, almost like a child, an engulfing elation,'' Petit
said afterward, looking windswept and tired but triumphant.
   ``The hardest part was not letting my joy surpass the control I
needed to continue. I was invaded by a joy that was almost dangerous
because I had my life in my hands.''
   With well-wishers and the press on hand, Petit announced that his
next walk would be across the Grand Canyon next summer.
   Petit, known for his dangerous walks between the towers of Notre
Dame Cathedral and New York's World Trade Center, slid down a
gossamer thin rope to the second floor of the Eiffel Tower and
delivered the declaration text into the hands of Paris Mayor Jacques
Chirac.
   His slender 5-foot-7-inch frame was decked out at the beginning
in a silver jumpsuit with sky blue scarves dangling from his arms
and legs.
   Early on in the walk, he stripped off the costume by French
couturier Thierry Mugler and was left in a multi-colored body
stocking that made him look like a small exotic bird against the
blue sky.
   He lay down, carelessly dangling a leg off the wire. He stopped
to admire the monuments of Paris. He waved his arms and kicked his
feet.
   ``Magnifique, formidable, super,'' bubbled 8-year-old Joanna
Bosc, who added that she enjoyed the show.
   Eighteen-year-old Fleur Saltes came 60 miles from the town of
Meaux to see the spectacle and said it was worth the trip.
   ``It was really scary because of the wind, but it ended
wonderfully,'' she said.
   The walk was the highlight of celebrations marking the
bicentennial of the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
   Partying continued Saturday night at a concert sponsored by
President Francois Mitterrand under the monumental cube of the new
Arche de la Defense.
   An international line-up of performers played in the nationally
televised concert, including American diva Barbara Hendricks,
Senegalese singer Youssou Ndour, American jazzman Eddy Louiss,
French rocker Jacques Higelin, African swinger Manu Dibango, popular
Algerian singer Cheb Khaled and others.
   The events brought to an end a busy summer of bicentennial
celebrations, which climaxed with parades and fireworks on July 14,
the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille Prison.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months in a political coma, Mayor Edward I.
Koch's underdog candidacy for a fourth term is showing signs of
life. But with the Democratic primary a little more than two weeks
away, it's far from clear that he's overtaken the man seeking to
become the city's first black mayor.
   Koch has cut back on his well-known acerbic rhetoric, is spending
$200,000 a week on television commercials, and has been seeking out
other political leaders.
   ``Ed Koch keeps publicly and privately pleading for my support,''
Herman Badillo, a prominent Hispanic political leader and former
congressman, said last week. ``David Dinkins hasn't called.''
   Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, is Koch's chief
opponent in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary, and while Badillo
hasn't made his endorsement yet, his preference seems clear. ``The
first rule of politics,'' he said, ``is that you've got to ask.''
   Koch has been doing a lot of asking this summer, most of it with
his trademark unselfconsciousness, and his efforts seem to be paying
off.
   ``What we had to do was make the turnaround. We'd been in a
descending posture, to say the least, for at least a year,'' said
David Garth, Koch's longtime strategist. ``Now it's a very close
race between Dinkins and Koch.''
   But Dinkins still leads in the polls, and some analysts say the
mayor remains a hobbled candidate.
   Two polls of likely voters last week showed Dinkins at 42
percent, with Koch getting 33 percent or 34 percent. The other two
Democrats were in the single digits, with about 10 percent undecided.
   ``Koch had to burp up a little bit because he couldn't get any
lower than he was,'' said Norman Adler, a consultant for the
Teamsters union, which backs Dinkins. ``The mayor's worst enemy is
not Dinkins. It's the mayor.''
   The two other Democrats are Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and
former transit chief Richard Ravitch. Contestants for the Republican
nomination are former federal prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani and
cosmetics heir and former ambassador Ronald Lauder.
   Unpopularity dogs Koch. He suffers from concern over soaring
crime, drug abuse and long-running corruption scandals. Voters
express fatigue with his nearly 12-year tenure; in April, 58 percent
wished he would not run.
   Yet Koch knows how to court the electorate. The mainstay of his
recovery has been a steady diet of television advertisements _
$200,000 a week's worth since July 1 _ featuring citizens touting
his accomplishments.
   The mayor's image appears only in a small photo at the close. The
effect is to play down Koch's personality while playing up his
experience.
   ``What the mayor has done right is to moderate his rhetoric. He
is talking more about performance. He is not engaging in any
personal attacks,'' said Paul Crotty, his campaign manager. ``He
says he is a kinder, gentler Koch, and he has been for the better
part of the year.''
   Koch still would likely lose a kind-and-gentle contest with
Dinkins. Understated, non-combative, Dinkins has spent more time
collecting endorsements than dueling opponents.
   For Dinkins, ``The unacknowledged campaign slogan for the last
six months is operative for the last three weeks: Slow and steady
wins the race,'' said Mark Green, an unpaid adviser and former
Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate. ``It's neither in Dinkins'
character nor the campaign's need to throw a lot of last-second hail
Mary passes.''
   Dinkins has sharpened his style somewhat, charging Koch with
divisiveness and mismanagement and painting him, in a television ad,
as a patron of housing for the wealthy. But Dinkins' message,
overall, remains mild; one ad's tag line proclaims, ``You don't have
to be loud to be strong.''
   The approach has its critics. ``Dinkins has just been too weak a
candidate,'' said Badillo, who has had fallings-out with both
Dinkins and Koch in past political wars. ``He's been too timid. He's
not been effective. And he's taken the Hispanic community for
granted.''
   Although ethnic politics have not played a dominant role, each
candidate has sought to expand his base. An ad for Dinkins stresses
his support for Israel and his criticism of Islamic minister Louis
Farrakhan. Koch, who is Jewish, has ads that are peopled heavily
with blacks and Hispanics.
   ``We're counting on a healthy proportion of the African-American
vote,'' said David Fishlow, spokesman for Dinkins. ``But we also
have lots of white and Hispanic areas targeted for get-out-the-vote
operations.''
   Getting out the vote is key in the primary. Dinkins, with strong
union support, expects 7,000 volunteers to hand out literature, work
the telephones and take voters to the polls. Koch expects 2,000
volunteers.
   ``David Dinkins does have a tactical advantage on Election Day
because he does have troops. On the other hand we have a tactical
advantage in our incumbency,'' said Crotty. ``We've always believed
that as you got closer and closer to the primary, Koch would look
better and better.''

<HEAD>Communists Reject Hungary, Poland-Style Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Milos Jakes
on Saturday rejected the type of reforms embraced by Hungary and
Poland, and condemned foreign activists who participated in recent
anti-government demonstrations.
   At a rally, Milos Jakes said the party cannot allow ``the
weakening of the leading role'' of the Communists, the official CTK
news agency reported.
   While no country was directly mentioned, Jakes' comments clearly
were meant to draw the line between Czechoslovakia and the two
Soviet bloc countries implementing the most daring reforms _ Hungary
and Poland.
   Both have committed themselves to a multi-party system and
increasingly favor free-market economics. In Poland, the first
non-Communist prime minister in the Soviet bloc took office last
week.
   On the foreign protesters, Jakes condemned ``the misuse of visits
to Czechoslovakia for interference in our internal affairs, as it
was demonstrated on Aug. 21,'' said CTK.
   Prague riot police dispersed thousands of demonstrators Aug. 21,
the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed
attempts to liberalize Communism in ways that resemble some present
Soviet, Polish and Hungarian reforms.
   State news media said 370 people were detained, including 50
foreigners.
   At the rally Saturday at Banska Bystrica, 300 miles east of
Prague, Politburo member Ignac Janak condemned ``actions of ...
so-called `tourists' from Hungary, Poland, Italy and some other
countries,'' CTK reported.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said, ``they did not behave
... as normal tourists, such as come to Prague by the millions every
year. Therefore a punishment must come.''
   The Rude Pravo commentary appeared directed at two Hungarian
activists. The government said Thursday that the rest of those
detained had been released.
   The two _ identified as Tamas Deutsch and Gyoergy Kereny of
Hungary's FIDESZ political opposition group _ unfurled a banner at
the demonstration proclaiming, ``Bolsheviks Came With Tanks, We Come
With Flowers.'' Kereny also addressed the crowd before his arrest.
   CTK said the two would be tried for committing an offense against
the public order. It did not say what the maximum sentence could be.
   The Hungarian news agency MTI, in a report from Budapest, said
the two were informed at the Prague city jail that they would be
tried. Also present were the Hungarian consul and a Josef Lzicar, an
attorney known for his defense of prominent human rights advocate
Vaclav Havel.
   Both men submitted a formal complaint against their arrest, and
the Hungarian Embassy in Prague guaranteed the two would appear at
trial, said MTI. Diplomatic sources said, however, that the two
remained in custody.
   In Budapest, hundreds of FIDESZ supporters gathered in front of
the Czechoslovak Embassy to protest the decision to try the two, and
spokesmen said the group would continue the vigil.
   Janak also criticized Hungarian TV for airing interviews critical
of the Soviet military intervention with officially disgraced
Czechoslovaks on the night of the anniversary.
   Among those interviewed were the architect of the reforms, former
Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek, and Havel, a prominent
member of the Charter 77 human rights monitoring organization.
   ``Good neighborly relations, the spirit of mutual trust, respect
and understanding are not built in a way demonstrated to us
constantly by some foreign political journalists of Hungarian
television,'' Janak said.
   When it aired initially in April, the Dubcek interview drew
strong protest from the Czechoslovak leadership, which took power
after the Soviet-led invasion.
   Hungary was one of five Warsaw Pact countries that participated
in the invasion. But its Communist leadership has been the only one
within the pact to call the military intervention a mistake.

<HEAD>In New, Modest Location, PTL's Heritage Church Struggles to Rebuild
Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the PTL's deposed leader struggles
in a federal courtroom, the Rev. Sam Johnson faces a different
battle _ rebuilding the image of the church that was left behind.
   ``I sometimes envy the ministries that weren't affected by the
PTL mess,'' said Johnson, now the pastor of Heritage Church, which
has moved from the 2,300-acre PTL park near here to three concrete
buildings in a lower-middle-class neighborhood. ``Some ministries
were affected by the scandal. But we were the scandal. We were the
eye of the storm.''
   Heritage Church was founded by Jim Bakker, whose trial on fraud
and conspiracy charges begins this week in federal court. The jury
was selected last week.
   Richard Dortch, Bakker's top assistant from 1984 to 1987, already
has pleaded guilty to four fraud and conspiracy charges and was
sentenced last week to eight years in prison and a $200,000 fine.
   It was Dortch who asked Johnson, then PTL's executive in charge
of missions, for a $10,000 loan to handle a ``kook'' who was
threatening the ministry.
   The ``kook'' turned out to be Jessica Hahn, whose tryst with
Bakker in 1980 eventually led to the television evangelist's
resignation from PTL in March 1987. Dortch, investigations showed,
arranged a payoff of $265,000 in ministry funds to buy her silence.
   The $10,000 loan landed Johnson a seat before the federal grand
jury that investigated PTL for 16 months before indicting Bakker,
Dortch and James and David Taggart _ two former Bakker assistants
who have been convicted of tax evasion and face up to 25 years in
prison and $1 million in fines each in sentencing scheduled Sept. 8.
   Johnson, who left PTL in disgust one month after Bakker resigned,
was not indicted. He later returned to take over Heritage Church.
   The church, Johnson said last week, has been badly battered by
the PTL fall.
   The television ministry is struggling to carry on nightly
broadcasts. Last Wednesday, the church rented an extra hour of
satellite time to appeal for funds and said the television shows may
be off the air soon in New York, Los Angeles and other major markets.
   As for the numbers attending services in person, Johnson avoids
comparison figures, but the church's former sanctuary was about
three times the size of the one the congregation has now. Johnson,
instead, compares the church to Samson of the Bible.
   ``His eyes were poked out, his hair had been cut off, he had lost
his beauty,'' Johnson said of the Old Testament character. ``But his
hair grew back and the Spirit returned to him. And the last verse of
that story is important _ it says he killed more Philistines in that
final day than his entire life before.
   ``He came back from the lowest point of his life to a great
victory,'' said Johnson, a Bible school classmate of Bakker's.
   Prosecutors contend that Bakker and other PTL executives diverted
$4 million in donations to the ministry to support fancy homes,
designer clothing and lavish travel.
   Three months after Bakker resigned, PTL was put under bankruptcy
protection and the church was left to face his disenchanted former
supporters.
   ``The bitterness was heaped on us from time to time,'' Johnson
said.
   Prosecutors say PTL raised $158 million between 1984 and 1987
through ``lifetime partnerships'' that promised supporters three
nights lodging per year for life in the hotels being constructed at
Heritage USA, PTL's expansive retreat near here.
   Prosecutors say the money was diverted to support the Bakkers'
plush lifestyle. In those years, Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye,
drew $3.5 million in bonuses plus other perks.
   ``I do not believe that people begrudge them the salaries, though
they were excessive,'' Johnson said. ``And I think people could
forgive him for the Jessica Hahn thing.
   ``But what hurt the most were the broken promises,'' Johnson
said. ``That's what brought the bitterness, the hurt among those who
believed in the ministry.''
   In the church's new surroundings there is no Heritage Grand
Hotel, no covered shopping mall, no sprawling water park.
   ``It's an old gymnasium,'' Johnson said, looking out at the rows
of folding chairs.
   ``We're back to the basics here. We're not about buildings and
land and water parks here, but the spirit is with us.''
   The church bought the folding chairs, six television cameras and
a broadcast truck from Stephen Mernick, the Canadian businessman who
bought Heritage USA through the bankruptcy court. Mernick sold the
equipment at a bargain, Johnson said, helping the ministry to stay
on the airwaves.
   The move from Bakker's dream resort came from necessity, Johnson
said, but it may have symbolic value in showing to journalists and
others drawn here by the Bakker trial that the church is no longer
Bakker's church.
   ``We're hoping that when they come here, they'll see this is not
the same place, that there's a different spirit here now,'' Johnson
said.

<HEAD>Lutherans Hit Sexual Harassment Of Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
lashed out Saturday at widespread sexual harassment of women and
called on congregations to make sure their churches are free of such
mistreatment.
   At one point at the church's governing assembly, women who had
experienced harassment were asked to stand, and about 40 of
aproximately 300 women among 1,000 delegates did so.
   The Rev. Judith Gerlitz of New York City said that while sexual
harassment and abuse has spread in the country, ``the church has
done little about it.''
   Some denominations have done surveys finding the problem
extensive even among church personnel and have initiated
countermeasures. The assembly here added its stern voice on the
matter.
   The church ``will not tolerate any forms of sexual abuse or
harassment by any of its personnel,'' the assembly declared, and
pledged to make ``our church a safe place for all persons'' by
moving firmly against such abuses.
   The 5.3-million-member denomination called for looking into the
problem at various church levels and creation of procedures for
victims to report incidents and also to provide ``healing for
victims.''
   ``Sexual violence of many kinds is widespread in our society,''
including ``sexual harassment on the job, rape and sexual assault,
incest and child abuse,'' the resolution said.
   It estimated two-fifths of working women have been sexually
harassed and a third of children sexually abused before 18.
   Such abuses ``betray God's creation, inflict grievous suffering
... and rend the fabric of the whole community of the people of
God,'' the church said.
   Another action saluted the 20th anniversary of the start of
ordination of women in the three Lutheran branches merged into the
present denomination. It has about 1,000 ordained women among 11,000
clergy.
   Congregations that ``have not experienced the preaching, teaching
or pastoral care of women'' were encouraged to open doors to them.
Active recruitment was urged of women for seminaries and ordination.
   ``The church has made a commitment not to keep a separate role of
silent and second-class women,'' said Christine Myers Crist,
executive director of the church's commission for women.
   That means, she told the assembly, bringing ``the unheard,
unheeded voices of women into full participation.'' Some feel that
is to ``try to destroy men,'' she said. ``No way.''
   In a report, she noted that 60 percent of the church's members
are women. Recalling the example of Jesus in regard to women, the
report said:
   ``Barriers against women were woven into the fabric of the
society in which Jesus lived. But Jesus reached ... across all those
barriers against women,'' ignoring rules against them, putting
Scriptures back in their hands.
   ``He appeared first to women as witnesses to his resurrection,''
the report said.
   The assembly is the first since the 1988 merger of the Lutheran
Church in America, the American Lutheran Church and the Association
of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   The eight-day assembly runs through Wednesday.

   The civil rights convictions of white supremacists
David Lane and Bruce Pierce in the murder of radio talk show host
Alan Berg have been upheld by a federal appeals court.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the defendants'
arguments that they participated in Berg's murder because they hated
the outspoken broadcaster as an individual and not because he was a
Jew. The two had contended their federal civil rights convictions
and 150-year prison sentences should be overturned for that reason.
   ``No reversible error has been demonstrated,'' the appeals court
said in its decision Friday.
   The court also rejected other arguments by the defendants,
including that there was insufficient evidence to convict them and
that their civil rights trial amounted to double jeopardy because
their earlier racketeering trial included testimony about the Berg
murder.
   Lane and Pierce belonged to a group of white supremacists called
The Order. They were convicted by a Denver U.S. District Court jury
in November 1987 of violating the civil rights of Berg, 50, when he
was gunned down in June 1984.
   They were indicted on the civil rights count, of interfering with
a federally protected right resulting in death, because there is no
federal murder charge. State prosecutors had decided there was
insufficient evidence to try the two for murder.
   The two, along with several others, were also convicted of
federal racketeering charges, which included allegations of the Berg
killing, in Seattle in 1985. Their 150-year sentences for the Denver
convictions are to follow their racketeering sentences.
   Pierce was sentenced to 100 years and Lane to 40 years for the
racketeering convictions, which were based on their roles in Berg's
death, bank robberies and counterfeiting.
   Witnesses had testified that the murder was triggered by Berg's
on-air derision of the defendants' right-wing beliefs.

Ends</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Soviet KGB said Saturday
that Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland's first non-Communist
leader, is ``a solid man'' who will succeed in solving the nation's
problems.
   Also Saturday, several hundred railroad workers in the city of
Lodz ended their strike at the request of Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa. The workers urged Mazowiecki to grant their pay demands.
   Walesa also met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Senate
Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kansas, and gave them a letter for
President Bush seeking more U.S. economic aid to help Poland's
struggling economy.
   Party Central Committee Secretary Leszek Miller, meanwhile, told
a meeting of leaders of party committees that they should be loyal
to the new Solidarity-led government, the state-run PAP news service
reported.
   ``There is no conflict between preserving ideological identity as
party members and being loyal to the legal state authorities,''
Miller said.
   Mazowiecki's meeting with KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov was his
highest-level contact with a Soviet official since the Polish leader
took office last week in a historic transfer of power from the
Communist Party.
   ``I liked him,'' Kryuchkov told reporters after he emerged
Saturday evening from seeing Mazowiecki at the Office of the Council
of Ministers. ``A solid man.''
   According to the KGB chairman, Mazowiecki spoke of his plans for
Poland's government while he told Mazowiecki about social reforms in
the Soviet Union. The talks were ``productive and interesting,'' he
said.
   Poland's new prime minister ``knows how to deal with things,''
Kryuchkov concluded. ``We wished him great success, and he will be
successful.''
   Polish state television later broadcast the first part of the
meeting on its main evening news. ``I am glad I can see you and that
I have my first opportunity to talk to a representative of the
Soviet leadership,'' Mazowiecki told his guest.
   The irony of Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity activist and
former political prisoner, receiving at his government office the
head of the Soviet intelligence agency is another example of the
remarkable changes overtaking Poland and the Communist world.
   It also seemed to underscore the high level of Soviet concern as
it begins adjusting to the new reality.
   Kryuchkov turned up without prior public announcement Saturday
and first met with Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski and the
acting interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, whom Mazowiecki
replaced as prime minister. Kiszczak then accompanied Kryuchkov to
the meeting with Mazowiecki.
   On Friday, Mazowiecki met with the Soviet Union's ambassador to
Poland, Vladimir Brovikov, one day after he took office.
   The installation of a non-Communist-led government in Poland has
been greeted with concern but apparent acceptance in Moscow,
although many of the practical ramifications have not been worked
out.
   Mazowiecki has said that under his Solidarity-led government the
Communist Party will retain the defense and interior ministries and
that Poland will maintain its obligations to the Warsaw Pact and
Comecon, the East bloc economic alliance.
   But it has not been made clear if Mazowiecki as prime minister
will have access to sensitive state secrets concerning, for
instance, Warsaw Pact defense strategies, or if he will sit in on
all the discussions at the annual full Warsaw Pact summits.
   Poland is the Soviet Union's largest and most strategic East bloc
ally, linking it to East Germany, the front-line state facing the
NATO states in the West.
   The KGB, the Committee for State Security, controls the secret
police, intelligence gathering and border defense for the Soviet
Union. Kryuchkov has been chairman since last year and has brought
an unprecedented openness to the post, undergoing questioning from
Soviet legislators and granting several press interviews.
   Before meeting Kryuchkov, Mazowiecki flew by helicopter to the
southern shrine city of Czestochowa for annual ceremonies honoring
the Black Madonna, Poland's most revered icon, at the Jasna Gora
monastery.
   A meeting of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops was taking place
at the monastery. Mazowiecki is the first practicing Catholic to
lead the government in postwar Poland, a country in which more than
90 percent of the people consider themselves Catholic.
   In other developments Saturday:
   _Railroad workers in Lodz, under pressure from Walesa, ended a
one-day strike and sent an appeal to Mazowiecki, ``our premier,''
asking him to satisfy their pay demands.
   The conclusion of the railroad strike at 12:01 a.m. followed an
appeal by Walesa that the new prime minister be given a chance to
begin to work. Walesa said Mazowiecki's election was a
``breakthrough'' not to be wasted.
   Abandoning the strike, rail workers said in a statement, was ``a
proof of our support and trust'' for Mazowiecki. The strike by
several hundreds workers had shut down all local train service.
   _Walesa met in Gdansk with the Doles, who delivered a letter of
greeting from Bush.
   ``I am very satisfied,'' Walesa said after the meeting. ``In the
United States there is great interest in Poland now, and I hope
these visits which are so numerous recently will help encouraged
investors to get involved in Poland.''
   He said he was giving the Doles a letter for Bush asking for
increased U.S. economic involvement in Poland to match the faster
pace of reforms going on.
   But Mrs. Dole said after the meeting she did not foresee
immediate financial aid beyond the $119 million that Bush offered
during a visit to Poland in July. ``Of course, as we can and when we
can we will hope to increase that aid,'' she said.

   The Communist Party's Central Committee on Saturday
harshly criticized nationalist activists in the Baltic republics,
saying they are leading the restive region into an ``abyss.''
   The official message from the party's policy-making body accused
``separatist elements'' of whipping up ``nationalist hysteria'' in
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and appealed for an end to their push
for secession.
   The message came three days after more than 1 million residents
of the Baltic region linked hands in a giant chain to protest the
Soviet-Nazi pact of 50 years ago that led to the Soviet annexation
of the three states.
   The sharply worded appeal showed clear concern in the highest
councils of the Soviet leadership about the possibility of the
beginning of the breakup of the Soviet Union, a nation of many
ethnic groups.
   The statement was read as the top item on the nightly news
program ``Vremya'' and carried by the official Tass news agency.
   ``Things have gone far. Serious danger is threatening the Baltic
people,'' the Central Committee said. ``People should know what
abyss their nationalist leaders are pushing them toward.''
   In an apparent reference to economic problems, the message
continued: ``If they managed to attain their goals, the consequences
could be catastrophic for their peoples. Their very ability to
survive could come under question.''
   The Central Committee also criticized the three republics'
government and party leaders, saying some did not try hard enough to
stop the slide toward separatism and others ``played up to the
nationalist mood and weakened their opposition to separatist plans.''
   Grassroots Baltic groups have turned during the past weeks to
more and more active agitation for full independence for their small
republics.
   Their increasingly open calls for secession have brought
counterattacks in the central Soviet press, but Saturday's Central
Committee message was Moscow's sharpest response so far.
   The Central Committee condemned the ``anti-socialist, anti-Soviet
thrust'' of the Baltic activists and said they were working against
the common interests of the Soviet people.
   In initial reaction, Baltic activists said the appeal would not
divert them from their drive for independence.
   The message ``won't have any particular effect because it doesn't
include any concrete steps,'' said Ulo Kaevats of the Estonian
People's Front. ``I see it as an expression of weakness and of a
policy that is not very rational.''

   The government is investigating whether private
security companies from Israel helped train assassination squads for
Colombian drug lords, a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.
   An Israeli reserve officer whom news reports have linked to such
activities said he had actually been teaching cattlemen how to
protect themselves from communist guerrillas.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking on Israel
radio, said Israel had set up a special investigating committee
without being requested to do so by either Colombia or the United
States.
   Colombia and the United States launched a major drive to break up
the drug-trafficking underworld in Colombia after drug bosses there
had a presidential candidate killed last week.
   The Medellin drug cartel supplies most of the cocaine sold in the
United States.
   ``Two days ago, we asked the Colombian government at the request
of Foreign Minister (Moshe) Arens for any information available to
them, and we have offered them assistance with anything we can do,''
Netanyahu said.
   ``We need to find out if Israelis indeed are involved ... and
what we can do to make sure that they are not,'' he added.
   The Israeli government made the request after American news
reports that some Israelis were helping Colombian drug cartels train
assassination squads.
   The Foreign Ministry official said Israel would take action
against anyone found to have violated Israeli laws.
   He had said Friday that Israel may revoke passports of any
Israeli mercenaries proven to be involved in training assassination
squads.
   Lt. Col. Yair Klein, identified as an Israeli trainer of such
squads on the basis of videotape broadcast by the NBC News, returned
to Israel on Friday from Miami.
   The 44-year-old Israeli is a retired commander of a paratroop
anti-terror unit and president of a private security firm called
Spearhead.
   ``I trained a group of farmers who defended themselves against
terrorist organizations, mostly the group called M-19, a guerrilla
group with the goal of turning Colombia into Cuba or Nicaragua,''
Klein said on Israeli television Friday.
   A senior Defense Ministry official said Klein is likely to be
questioned about his activities in Colombia. The television said
that the ministry is considering filing a police complaint.
   However, Israeli television and major dailies last week
identified Klein as the leader of four Israeli army reserve colonels
reported to have worked with the Colombian drug traffickers.
   Klein said Saturday on armed forces radio that his company
trained Colombian cattlemen and that the video in which he was shown
was made by Spearhead for advertising purposes.
   He said the company completed its training a year ago and that
his last visit to Colombia was four months ago. Klein said that
visit had nothing to do with the training program, but he did not
say exactly why he went.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Reportedly to Charge Former U.S. Soldier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magazine said Saturday that
federal prosecutors are preparing to charge a former U.S. soldier
with treason for his alleged role in a spy ring that sold NATO
secrets to the Soviets.
   The Hamburg-based Der Spiegel magazine said it would be the first
time in West German history that a foreigner faced such charges.
   According to the Spiegel report, federal prosecutors in Karlsruhe
are concluding an investigation and preparing to charge Clyde Lee
Conrad with high treason.
   Conrad remains in investigative custody in a West German prison
following his arrest in August 1988.
   Under West German law, the 42-year-old former soldier would face
a maximum 10-year prison sentence if convicted on spying charges.
However, he could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of
high treason.
   The federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe was closed Saturday,
and officials could not be reached immediately to comment on the
report.
   Der Spiegel did not say when Conrad would be charged.
   In February, prosecutors said their investigation of Conrad had
showed that NATO strategies were damaged more than they thought when
he was arrested.
   Authorities suspect Conrad acted as ringleader of an
international spy network that sold the Soviets information about
the Western alliance's nuclear missiles, bases, and troop strengths.
   Prosecutors believe Conrad, who had access to secret documents
before retiring from the Army in 1985, collected more than $1
million for peddling the secrets.
   Spiegel said the former sergeant is suspected of selling the
Soviets secret rocket codes for nuclear weapons on West German soil.
   Conrad was in charge of keeping classified NATO documents, which
were held in a safe at the Bad Kreuznach base.
   News reports at the time of Conrad's arrest said he had hired
other U.S. soldiers to obtain information. The material was was
passed by couriers to a Hungarian intelligence officer in Vienna,
Austria, and then on to the Soviets, according to the reports.

<HEAD>Newton's Family Prepares Services As Suspect Awaits Arraignment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prison gang member was held without bail
Saturday in the death of Huey P. Newton as the family and friends of
the Black Panther co-founder prepared for funeral services.
   Tyrone Robinson, 25, faced arraignment on a charge of homicide
Monday, the same day as Newton's public funeral here.
   Newton, 47, was shot to death early Tuesday in what police
described as a continuing dispute over drugs.
   Police said Robinson, arrested 14 hours after the slaying, told
investigators Friday he shot Newton three times in the head in
self-defense. He said Newton, who had a history of substance abuse,
pulled a gun and demanded crack cocaine, but police said there was
no evidence Newton was armed.
   Instead, investigators said they believe Newton's slaying was an
attempt by Robinson, an admitted small-time drug dealer, to make a
name for himself in the Black Guerrilla Family, a drug-running
prison-based gang.
   Police said a witness to the shooting heard Robinson say ``I'll
make rank, man, I'll make rank'' as he fired the shots, apparently
referring to a hoped-for advancement. Police would not identify the
witness.
   The confrontation was the latest in a series of run-ins between
Newton and the Black Guerrilla Family, police said.
   ``Mr. Newton was a person the BGF felt had crossed them. He had
robbed and stolen dope from members of the BGF in the past,'' said
Oakland homicide Sgt. Dan Mercado.
   Through a spokesman, Newton's family declined to comment Saturday
on the arrest. At the time of his death, Newton and his wife,
Frederika Slaughter Newton, had lived in Berkeley.
   The family prepared for Monday's funeral at Allen Temple Baptist
Church in Oakland. Organizers said they expect 2,000 mourners,
including Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale, at the service.
   A public viewing also was planned at an Oakland mortuary on
Sunday.
   Meanwhile, the site on a West Oakland street where the slaying
occurred has become something of a shrine. Supporters have placed
wreaths and flowers and lit candles on the sidewalk in the
drug-infested neighborhood where Newton, as the Panthers' minister
of defense, established programs for poor blacks two decades ago.
   Police said Friday they believe Newton, who had a history of drug
and alcohol abuse and entered a hospital treatment program in 1984,
had been using cocaine Monday night and early Tuesday.
   In the final hours of his life, investigators said, Newton went
to a ``crack house'' where he and Robinson got into an argument
after Newton demanded the drug.

   It could be tough to find a tow truck in
Rhode Island on Sunday, unless the breakdown is somewhere between
the Warwick Mall and the Rocky Point amusement park.
   Tow truck drivers and rigs from nine states are scheduled to
parade between the two sites, hoping to gain a little more respect
from drivers who equate calling a tow truck with visiting the
dentist for root canal work.
   ``It's basically an awareness thing,'' said Lou Pucino of Pucino
Brothers of Rhode Island. His East Greenwich company is a
major-league towing operation with 10 trucks that can handle
everything from Volkswagens to buses.
   ``Sure, you say, `I don't get enough respect' for the work you
do. We do too,'' Pucino said. ``People ridicule us a lot in tough
situations.''
   Pucino presides over the Rhode Island Towing Association this
year and decided it was time to show off. When the association
shifted its annual family outing from a Massachusetts farm to Rocky
Point, he said he thought of the parade, something towing
associations in other states also have done.
   Pucino said he expects nearly 100 gleaming trucks with their
lights flashing and uniformed drivers to roll along in formation.
   ``A lot of people don't realize how sophisticated our business
has become,'' Pucino said. ``As cars have become more sophisticated,
so has our equipment. ... There are no hooks on tow trucks anymore.''
   The new gentler tow truck now uses a sling that slides under the
wheels and lets a car ride on its own suspension, he said.
   A small towing rig can cost $35,000, he said. And the price of
some of the larger ones? If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
   ``We want the people to realize that we are not putting the money
under our mattresses. We're spending it on men and equipment,'' he
said.
   The towing association has 85 members out of about 110 licensed
towers in Rhode Island, but all this sophistication should mean that
motorists won't have to steam on the highway while the tow drivers
enjoy a clambake.
   ``We all have radios nowadays, and cellular phones. Everybody's
in touch,'' Pucino said. ``So hopefully we'll be able to provide the
service on Sunday.''

<HEAD>Huge, Vaguely Authentic Cattle Drive to Mark Montana Centennial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM LACEKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What started as the nostalgic whimsy of
three friends has become a corporate extravaganza of 3,000 real and
fancied cowpokes, 300 covered wagons and 4,000 cattle that will roll
across Montana next month.
   It's an Old West cattle drive like the Old West never saw, a
state-sanctioned event to celebrate Montana's 100th anniversary in a
vaguely authentic re-creation of the days of the open range.
   Cold beer and entertainment every night. And no rustlers.
   The Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive is just one of scores
of events sanctioned by the Montana Centennial Commission, but it
stands alone for its grandiose scope, gaudy exuberance and big-time
price tag.
   Officials of the non-profit Latigo Corp., established to organize
the drive, estimate the cost at anywhere from $400,000 to $1
million, depending on variables such as the fees for country-western
talent who will entertain at the wagon train each night. Grammy
Award winner Lee Greenwood headlines the final concert in Billings
Sept. 9.
   The drive begins on Labor Day at the little town of Roundup,
chosen as the origin partly for its name.
   It will roll southward 60 miles in a leisurely six days, from the
banks of the Musselshell River, through the Bull Mountains, across
the prairie, ending near the Yellowstone River at the livestock
auctions of Billings. That's about the same pace as the cattle
drives of 100 years ago.
   About 100 drovers _ experienced cowhands _ have been hired to
drive the main herd and a separate lead herd of some 300 longhorns.
   The wagon train will follow with its mixture of dudes,
nostalgists and adventurers, ranging from celebrities such as
television magnate Ted Turner to would-be westerners from as far
away as Japan and Australia.
   The youngest drover is 13-year-old Turk Stovall of Billings, who
has worked cattle since he was 2.
   ``This drive will not be of the Hollywood cowboy school, but
rather a 1989 drive which will honor and pay tribute to all the
great drives of the past,'' said western cartoonist Stan Lynde, an
originator of the idea.
   Billings officials will close some streets for the herd when it
arrives, and U.S. 87 south of Roundup will be closed to traffic for
two days.
   ``It is a federal route, but this is an extraordinary event,''
said Roger Scott, division administrator for the Federal Highway
Administration. ``There has never been a cattle drive like this.''
   The basic plan, as conceived by cartoonists Lynde and Barry
McWilliams and a friend, Jim Wempner, was to re-create an old-time
drive and let the public help drive the cattle to market, then sell
the herd and go home.
   It sounded so simple.
   The original goal was 10,000 cattle and 5,000 riders, but that
proved too ambitious a goal for the drive, which, for a time, bogged
down in logistics and personalities and almost died.
   Some of the financing and organization show ingenious modern
twists.
   When Nelson Story brought the first great herd from Texas to
Montana in 1866, he paid the cowboys to help him, as Latigo is
paying the drovers.
   But the non-professional riders who want to come on the
centennial drive are paying Latigo _ $130 to $150 for meal tickets,
plus $25 to feed their horses _ and contributing a cow to the herd,
besides. If they don't have a cow, Latigo will rent them one. Same
with the horses.
   Nelson Story hired a cook. Latigo hired two catering companies.
   And in 1866, Nelson Story never told his cowboys to bring
sunblock and bug spray.
   Though authenticity is not a major goal of the celebration,
participants are not allowed to wear baseball-style caps, tennis
shoes or bright-colored jeans. Backpacker tents will be allowed only
if their colorful modern fabric is hidden by plain canvas.
   Any profit from the drive will go to a fund to provide
scholarships for rural Montana youngsters and economic development
projects. Two foundations have pledged $2 million in matching funds.
   Other money-making devices include sale of licenses to identify
products with the drive, an auction of donated art and Western items
and the country-western concert.

   Rebels attacked a southern town but
were repelled by government forces, an official report said
Saturday. It said at least 19 people were killed.
   About 200 rebels of the Mozambican Resistance Movement launched
the attack Thursday on Macia, about 55 miles north of the capital of
Maputo, according to the government news agency AIM.
   At least 12 rebels and seven civilians were killed before
government troops forced the guerrillas to retreat, AIM said, citing
the Maputo daily newspaper Noticias. The report said nothing of
government casualties.
   Noticias also reported that other people were killed by rebels
who overran the central town of Laubo on Aug. 19. It did not say
exactly how many people died.
   The rebels have been fighting since 1977 to undermine
Mozambique's leftist government. No government acknowledges
supporting the rebels, who have devastated Mozambique's economy with
hit-and-run attacks on civilian and military targets.
   Rebel leaders and Mozambican clergymen representing the
government of President Joaquim Chissano met in Kenya this month for
preliminary peace talks, but no agreements were reported.
   The war has claimed an estimated 600,000 lives and displaced more
than 1 million people.

   Police on Saturday detained 15 ultra-Orthodox
Jews on suspicion of attacking cars driven by secular Jews in a
mostly religious Jerusalem neighborhood, a spokesman said.
   The ultra-Orthodox Jews were protesting what they consider a
violation of the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest lasting from
sundown Friday until sundown Saturday.
   Jewish religious laws forbid any work or money transactions on
Sabbath, and driving a car is considered a form of work.
   Police said 150 to 200 ultra-Orthodox Jews blocked the streets
and attacked motorists in Har Nof neighborhood.
   Thousands of ultra-Orthodox families populate Har Nof, which also
is home to several hundred secular families.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandouri said 15 ultra-Orthodox suspected of
disturbing public order and an illegal gathering were detained. Six
were teen-agers and three were released after questioning, he said.
   The last major wave of ultra-Orthodox protests in Jerusalem was
in December 1987, when hundreds of religious Jews demonstrated every
Saturday against movie theaters and other entertainment spots
operating on Sabbath.

<TEXT>
   To the somber cadence of muffled drums, an
estimated 35,000 people marched Saturday upon the Supreme Court and
Congress to protest what NAACP Director Benjamin L. Hooks called
``the legal lynching of black America's hope ... to become full
partners in the American dream.''
   The march, aimed at spurring legislative ``remedies'' for four
recent civil rights decisions by the high court, was fashioned in
tone and dress after the historic ``Silent March'' 72 years ago in
New York City. As then, men wore black and women and children wore
white; as then, the marchers kept their lips sealed throughout the
procession.
   The 1917 march of 8,000 people, led by W.E.B. DuBois, down Fifth
Avenue elevated the 8-year-old National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People to the forefront of the then-fledgling
civil rights movement. Saturday's event, which drew nearly every
major civil rights leader in the nation, may have restored that
standing for an organization which lately has been criticized within
the black community as staid and ineffective.
   ``For an organization that's dead, we did pretty good, didn't
we?'' beamed Hooks as he looked upon the throng which gathered at
the East Front of the Capitol for a rally after the silent march.
   Hooks claimed a turnout of 135,000 people; police estimates were
far smaller. The U.S. Park Police put the number of marchers at
35,000; the U.S. Capitol police said the crowd at the rally was
18,500.
   More than 200 civic, church and labor organizations had joined
the NAACP in sponsoring the march. Individuals joining Hooks on the
speaker's dais included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland, Joseph Lowery, president of the Sourthern Christian
Leadership Conference, Dorothy Height, president of the Black
Leadership Forum, and dozens of others.
   ``We come, presenting our bodies in silent protest, in a manner
used in 1917 to protest the brutal lynching of black Americans in
this nation,'' said Hooks. ``It is ironic that 72 years later, we
find ourselves marching once more to protest the legal lynching of
black America's hope for a chance to become full partners in the
American dream.
   ``The five justices who voted on four separate occasions to roll
back the clock on civil rights, by their actions, have unraveled the
ropes used by black Americans to climb out of the valleys of
economic segregation.''
   In the view of civil rights lawyers, the four decisions this year
seriously cut into the modern legal gains of minorities,
particularly employment rights. In one case, Patterson vs. McLean
Credit Union, the court sharply limited the power of minority men
and women to sue private parties, including schools, for
discrimatory practices. Similarly, the court's decision in Richmond
vs. J. A. Croson Co. was seen as diluting job set-aside programs _
guaranteeing certain percentages of municipal projects to minority
subcontractors _ and other affirmative action plans.
   March organizers also assailed the decision in Martin vs. Wilks,
which allowed white firefighters in Birmingham, Ala., to attack a
consent decree calling for the promotion of blacks as a case of
``reverse discrimination.'' The fourth ruling, Ward's Cove vs.
Antonio, was criticized as shifting the entire burden of proof in
job discrimination cases to the victims of employer bias.
   Kirkland told the rally at the Capitol that ``the unions march
today because we believe discrimination cannot be eradicated from
our society until there is equal employment opportunity for all
Americans.''
   The Supreme Court has often been the target of major
demonstrations in the capital in recent years. An estimated 325,000
turned out last spring to urge the court to stand by its 1973
decision legalizing abortion. However, the court weeks later
softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for anti-abortion
forces.

<HEAD>Polls: Frank's Consitutents Still Supportive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polls published Saturday indicated U.S. Rep. Barney
Frank's constituents still strongly support him despite revelations
about the congressman's relationship with a male prostitute.
   The state Republican Party, meanwhile, called for the
Massachusetts Democrat's resignation. But political observers
predicted Frank, who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in
1987, would survive the scandal.
   On Friday, Frank, 49, acknowledged he had once paid for sex with
a man he identified as Steve Gobie, then hired him as a personal
aide in an effort to wean him from a life of drugs and prostitution.
Frank said he fired Gobie when he became suspicious that the man was
selling sex from Frank's Capitol Hill apartment.
   Frank said he had been ``victimized'' and predicted voters would
not hold the incident against him.
   The polls _ and a tradition of tolerance in Massachusetts _
appear to back him up.
   A poll of 400 registered voters in Frank's district conducted
Friday night for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV showed 65.3 percent did
not think Frank should resign, while 22.3 percent did. About 12
percent had no opinion or refused to answer.
   The Boston Herald and WCVB-TV polled 300 of Frank's constituents,
and 56 percent said Frank has ``performed well enough as a
congressman to deserve re-election'' while 29 percent called for his
ouster. Five percent said their view depends on who opposes Frank in
1990.
   Both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.
   After publicly acknowledging his homosexuality, Frank won
election to his fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote in
the state's 4th District, encompassing some Boston suburbs and parts
of southeastern Massachusetts.
   ``It would be worse if it were some kind of a money scandal. His
sex life is well known, so it came as no surprise,'' said Robert
Freysigner, a political science professor at Bradford College in
Haverhill.
   The only other member of Congress to publicly acknowlege being a
homosexual is Rep. Gerry Studds, also a Massachusetts Democrat.
Studds easily won re-election after being censured by the House in
1983 for an affair 10 years earlier with a 17-year-old male House
page.
   The state GOP urged Frank to resign, charging he ``violated the
law,'' ``lied about the situation'' and showed a ``profound lack of
judgment.''
   Alexander Tennant, the party's executive director, said he
believes voters ``will absolutely object to Barney Frank when they
find out he has been using his public position to help a prostitute,
drug dealer and convicted felon.'' The Washington Times reported
Friday that Gobie had been convicted of obscenity, sex and drug
charges.
   But Christopher Bosso, a congressional scholar at Northeastern
University, said Frank's admissions likely would not affect his
reputation as an effective lawmaker.
   ``Power on Capitol Hill is based on two things: seniority and
support from the voters,'' Bosso said. ``Barney Frank is smart, even
those who disagree with him realize he's one of the smartest members
on Capitol Hill.''

<TEXT>
   Christopher W. French, an Associated Press
newsman and administrator for 23 years and editor of the AP
Stylebook since 1980, has died at age 49.
   French's wife, Sarah, discovered his body at their home in this
New York City suburb Friday after returning from a visit to
relatives out of state. The cause of death was not immediately
determined.
   As editor of the AP Stylebook, a 284-page manual that prescribes
word usage, punctuation and other guidelines for news writing,
French was an arbiter of journalistic style for news media across
the nation.
   The Boston-born journalist was a political science graduate of
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he studied
under a Navy scholarship. After four years of Navy service,
including stints as a gunnery, personnel and public relations
officer, he joined the AP in 1966 as a newsman in the news service's
Chattanooga, Tenn., bureau.
   In 1969, he was assigned to Nashville, the main Tennessee bureau.
In 1971-72 he was a political reporter at the Tennessee statehouse
and helped cover the 1972 national presidential campaign, including
the national party conventions. In November 1972 he was named
Nashville state editor, overseeing AP news coverage throughout
Tennessee.
   French transferred in 1974 to the General Desk in New York, the
central AP national news desk, where he worked as a national editor
and supervisor.
   Six years later, he was named AP Stylebook editor. In that
position, which he has recently shared as co-editor, he updated the
manual annually, to include new subject areas and take account of
changing times and usages.
   Among other editorial responsibilities at the General Desk,
French was editor of the AP Industry News Advisory, a compilation of
reports on developments within the news industry that is transmitted
weekly on AP wires.
   Since 1981, he also held the position of General Desk
administrative assistant for technology. In that role, he acted as
liaison between the editorial and technical staffs, and helped
introduce new computer systems into the AP headquarters in New York.
   Besides his wife, the former Sarah Quackenboss, he is survived by
two daughters, Emily and Catherine; by a sister, Suzanne French
O'Brien of Hopkinton, N.H., and by his mother, Thelma Westerling
French of Massachusetts.
   A memorial service will be conducted at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Christ
Episcopal Church in East Norwalk. In lieu of flowers, the family
asked that contributions be made to the donor's charity of choice.

<TEXT>
   Muggy air combined with high temperatures Saturday to create
dangerously oppressive conditions from the Tennessee Valley across
the lower Mississippi Valley into Texas, and storms drenched parts
of the South with heavy rainfall.
   The warm, humid air edged northward Saturday from the Gulf of
Mexico. Temperatures rose into the 90s from Florida, through the
coasts of Georgia and South Carolina across the Gulf Coast region,
the Tennessee Valley, and the lower Mississippi Valley into the
southern Plains and Kansas, as well as over the desert Southwest.
   The high temperatures and humidity pushed heat indexes above 105
degrees from the Tennessee Valley across the lower Mississippi
Valley into Texas. The heat index, or apparent temperature, is a
measure of heat and humidity sensed by the body.
   A reading above 105 is considered dangerous, especially to those
involved in prolonged outdoor physical activity.
   The temperature reached 95 degrees at Apalachicola, Fla., on
Saturday afternoon, breaking its record high for the day.
   Thunderstorms formed in the humid, unstable air from the upper
and middle Mississippi Valley across the western half of the Ohio
Valley into the Tennessee Valley.
   Some of the storms brought heavy rainfall. More than 1} inches of
rain deluged Lebanon, Tenn. Ashland, Ala., received more than 1\
inches Saturday afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across the southern
Atlantic Coast states.
   Much of the West had cool temperatures due to a high pressure
system centered over Montana. Readings Saturday afternoon were in
the 50s and 60s from western North Dakota across Wyoming and the
northern Rockies.
   Temperatures in the 50s and 60s were also common across Maine and
northern New England.
   The low temperature in the lower 48 states Saturday morning was
25 degrees at Jackson, Wyo. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m.
EDT ranged from 56 degrees at Arcata, Calif., and Crescent City,
Calif., to 101 degrees at Beeville, Texas.
   The forecast for Sunday called for showers and thunderstorms from
the eastern half of the Gulf Coast across the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast states, the Ohio Valley, the upper Great Lakes and
the upper Mississippi Valley into the northern Plains, and scattered
showers and thunderstorms over the northern Rockies and southwest
Texas.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 60s over northern Maine;
the 70s from Washington across the northern Rockies, the upper
Mississippi Valley and much of the Great Lakes region to New
England, along the California coast and the central Rockies; into
the 90s from the southern Atlantic coast and Florida across the Gulf
Coast region, Tennessee and lower Mississippi valleys, the lower
Missouri Valley into the southern Plains, and the interior valleys
of central and northern California; from 100 to 110 through the
desert Southwest and interior valleys of southern California; and in
the 80s across the rest of the nation.

   The body of a young Palestinian suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities was found Saturday hanging by
the neck in a West Bank orange grove, Arab journalists and Israel
radio said.
   In other developments, Israeli troops shot and killed a
17-year-old Palestinian youth and raided several villages in the
occupied West Bank, Arab reports said.
   The soldiers also battled Palestinian youths who built makeshift
barricades in Gaza City and hurled stones from rooftops, the reports
said.
   In other scattered clashes in the West Bank, seven Palestinians
were shot and wounded by army troops, Arab hospital officials said.
The wounded included a 13-year-old boy with a gunshot in the neck.
   The body of Amen Tayem, 20, was found in an orange grove in the
West Bank town of Qalqilya, Arab journalists said.
   They said Tayem was last seen being led out of his Qalqilya home
by a group of masked Palestinians two days ago. They attributed the
killing to ``security reasons,'' suggesting he was killed as a
suspected collaborator.
   Israel radio explicitly identified the man as a suspected
collaborator. It said he was beaten to death, and his body was later
tied to the electricity pole.
   An army spokesman confirmed the killing and said the motive was
apparently criminal. However, victims hanged in public places have
generally been suspected collaborators. A police spokesman declined
comment.
   A total of 98 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators during the 20-month Palestinian revolt
against Israeli occupation. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin claimed
the majority of the victims had no links to Israel.
   At least 548 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians in the uprising. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died in
the violence.
   In the village of Deir es-Sudan near Ramallah, an army patrol was
attacked by stone-throwing Arab youths, an army spokesman said, and
an officer opened fire, fatally wounding a 17-year-old Arab. Israel
radio identified the youth as Sami Hassan Adjadji.
   Palestinian journalists said soldiers raided at least three other
villages in the Ramallah area to arrest suspected uprising
ringleaders.
   The army on Saturday also clamped a curfew on the village of
Idna, near the West Bank town of Hebron, after villagers burned
several houses owned by a suspected Israeli collaborator, Arab
reports said.
   Arab journalists said Israeli soldiers raided at least three
villages in the Ramallah area Saturday to search for suspected
leaders of the uprising.
   During the one-hour clash in Gaza City, Arab youths blocked the
street with stone barricades, Arab journalists said. The protesters
also burned tires and threw stones at soldiers from rooftops, they
said.
   Troops responded with gunfire from observation posts atop
buildings, the journalists said.
   The former West Bank governor, reserve Brig. Gen. Ephraim Sneh,
said Saturday that unless peace efforts progressed, ``negative
processes in the field would strengthen and the radical voices .. .
would also increase.
   ``Their policy may become more tough, and they would issue more
radical orders. In the field, people would spontaneously take more
desperate and therefore more dangerous and violent actions,'' Sneh
said on Israel radio.

   Rescuers in airplanes and on foot

   Dozens of relatives of the 49 passengers and five crew gathered

propeller-driven Fokker 27 that disappeared early Friday.
   Five helicopters, two Pakistan air force C-130 transports and two
of the airline's planes searched the rugged northern mountains
Saturday, officials said. They were set to resume Sunday.
   ``We haven't got any indication yet of anything,'' said airline
spokeswoman Azra Sultan. ``We have flown 11 search sorties today and
the search parties are still on the ground since yesterday.''
   Poor weather hampered the initial search Friday as clouds dipped
below the 15,000-foot mountain peaks where the Himalayas meet the
equally lofty Korakoram range.
   Pilots reported better visibility Saturday.
   The missing plane took off from the mountain resort of Gilgit for
the 45-minute flight to Islamabad, 175 miles south.
   Airline officials said the last communication from the pilot was
a routine position check seven minutes into the flight.
   At least two foreigners were aboard the flight, airline spokesmen
said, including American free-lance journalist Paul McGorrian, 27, a
former staff writer for the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times.

   A newly restored version of Sergei Eisenstein's
1938 film classic, ``Alexander Nevsky,'' is wowing audiences on a
world tour that its producer hopes will carry it triumphantly back
to the Soviet Union.
   ``I'd love to take this film home to Russia,'' said producer John
Goberman, who said he is awaiting an overture from Moscow. ``The
first performance would knock them out. They'd be beside
themselves.''
   Besides Eisenstein's dramatic black-and-white photography, the
screen epic about the 13th century defeat of marauding Teutonic
armies by Russian forces led by Prince Nevsky features a rousing
musical score by composer Sergei Prokofiev.
   A fresh print of Eisenstein's 107-minute movie, made from the
original nitrate negative in the Moscow film archive, was prepared
for Goberman's ``concert presentation'' Saturday night at the
outdoor theater of Wolf Trap Farm Park in suburban Virginia.
   While shown on a 30-foot screen over the stage, with English
subtitles displayed on a smaller screen underneath, Prokofiev's
music was to be performed in sync with the film by the National
Symphony Orchestra, mezzo-soprano Janice Taylor and a chorus from
the Oratorio Society of Washington.
   The film has two tracks for remastered dialogue and sound
effects, a computer slide track for subtitles and a fourth track
that feeds cues to the orchestra conductor.
   ``The print is so gorgeous, it just glows,'' Goberman said. ``It
will make you fall in love with black-and-white film all over
again.''
   The music was another matter. Goberman described the faint,
scratchy soundtrack of the original film, performed by a 30-member
studio band, in one word: ``horrible.''
   ``The orchestra was clearly having a bad day with one of the
greatest film scores ever written,'' he said during a break in
rehearsals at the Kennedy Center.
   Shortly after Prokofiev completed the 60-minute movie score, he
condensed it into his widely performed, 40-minute ``Alexander Nevsky
Cantata'' for mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra.
   Copies of the original movie score are lost. So Goberman
recruited musical arranger William D. Brohn to transcribe the
missing 20 minutes of music from the original soundtrack for full
orchestra, using the cantata as a framework.
   ``We knocked ourselves out to make this music authentic,''
Goberman said. ``We even left in Prokofiev's obvious mistakes. We
took the film and added the music we think is what Prokofiev heard
in his head. It is fair to say that almost every note is by
Prokofiev.''
   Goberman, who also has produced the award-winning ``Live From
Lincoln Center'' broadcasts for public television, said performances
of ``Alexander Nevsky'' are booked through next year at the Pompeii
Festival in Italy, Toronto, San Diego and San Antonio, Texas.
   The restored version premiered in Los Angeles in November 1987,
and came to Washington after enthusiastic receptions in Cleveland,
Philadelphia, London and Hollywood.
   Eisenstein is reported to have made the film about Nevsky, a
legendary Russian hero, because he had fallen into disfavor and
needed a popular hit that would please Soviet dictator Josef Stalin
and his cultural bureaucrats.
   For his part, Stalin embraced ``Nevsky'' as a valuable piece of
artistic propaganda to mobilize the Soviet people against a
threatened invasion by Nazi Germany. The movie was shelved after the
Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact was signed in 1939 but was eagerly
shown after the Germans invaded two years later.
   For his efforts, Eisenstein was awarded the Order of Lenin and
slapped on the back from Stalin, who reportedly exclaimed, ``Sergei
Mikhailovich, you are a good Bolshevik after all!''
   Goberman rejects the notion that ``Nevsky'' is esoteric art or a
mere Stalinist propaganda vehicle.
   ``This is a popular film, made for audiences to enjoy,'' he said.
``This is cowboys and Indians, only they're Russians and Germans. It
was made to get audiences excited, and it really does.''

<TEXT>
   A couple was arrested early Saturday
surrounded by what one officer called ``enough money to bathe in''
and charged with running an operation that transported nearly $350
million to the Medellin drug cartel.
   John Posada, 28, of Medellin, Colombia, and his wife, Deysi, 26,
of Venezuela, were arrested shortly after midnight at their
residence in Roslyn Heights on Long Island, said Art Stiffel, a
special agent with the U.S. Customs Service.
   Both were charged with money laundering and conspiracy. Mrs.
Posada is additionally charged with making false statements for
giving police a phony name, Stiffel said. The couple was held
without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Facility in New York
City pending a hearing Thursday.
   An infant believed to be their child was taken from the home and
placed in the custody of Nassau County Children's Services, he said.
   He said $4 million in $10 and $20 bills and a money rolling
device were confiscated during the arrest. No drugs were found in
the apartment.
   ``The place is covered with money. There's enough money here to
bathe in. You could actually fill up your entire pool,'' he said.
``We believe it came from drug sales, but we haven't gotten that far
into the investigation.''
   The arrests came after a week-long probe by the Customs
Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Nassau and
Suffolk county police. A federal search warrant was issued Friday
night in Brooklyn.
   The couple allegedly had been laundering between $48 million and
$50 million per year for the past seven years to the Colombia-based
Medellin cartel, the world's largest cocaine selling operation,
Stiffel said.
   The investigation began with the arrest of a courier with
$250,000 in his luggage who was attempting to fly to Puerto Rico
from LaGuardia Airport, said Stiffel.
   He said the operation employed an average of 16 couriers a month,
each carrying over $250,000 in their suitcases.
   The bags, some weighing more than 100 pounds, were filled with
money-lined lightbulbs, bug spray cans and toys. They were checked
in at LaGuardia Airport and shipped directly to Columbia for pickup,
Stiffel said.
   The arrests coincide with a major offensive by the Colombian
government against drug traffickers. On Friday, President Bush sent
the government $65 million in emergency drug-fighting aid, including
helicopters, assault vehicles and small arms.

   An army unit and a Contra guerrilla
group drew guns when they met in northern Nicaragua but decided to
hold an informal half-hour peace parley that included an exchange of
cigarettes.
   It was the first known talks between Sandinista army and Contra
groups since the signing of a regional accord signed this month in
Honduras to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel force.
   An army unit commanded by Lt. Bernardo Diaz nearly ran into the
Contra group on a dirt road near the Honduran border Thursday
afternoon, said photographer Ruben Farina, the only journalist
present.
   ``Diaz shouted for everybody to hit the dirt, but at the same
time he was yelling at the Contras that he did not want any
shooting,'' Farina said.
   ``The Contras were yelling the same thing: that nobody wanted to
shoot, just talk. Those were pretty tense moments.''
   Eventually, after placing safety catches on weapons, Diaz and the
leader of the guerrilla squad, Marlon Moreno Espinoza, apparently
convinced each other of their good intentions.
   ``The decisive point in lowering the tension was when the
Sandinista soldiers started offering cigarettes to the Contras,''
said Farina, who was working for The Associated Press.
   ``From there on, the two sides sort of mingled _ still being
careful, though _ and started talking to each other in small
groups.''
   Rebel commander Danilo ``Wilmer'' Peralta had requested a meeting
Thursday morning with a Saninista unit near Los Manchones, about 150
miles north of Managua, but his detachment failed to show up, Farina
said.
   The 20 government troopers then moved north. They ran into the 30
Contras several hours later at a bend of the road.
   Farina said the 30-minute meeting ended with Moreno telling Diaz
that he would consult with Peralta and other superiors about
accepting amnesty and promising to make contact again next week.
   Diaz gave the Contras copies of the accord to dismantle the
Contras signed Aug. 7 in Tela, Honduras by the presidents of Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
   A U.N. observer group established at the behest of the Central
American presidents is to oversee the dismantling and repatriation
or relocation, an operation that should begin within two weeks and
be completed by Dec. 5.
   Most Contras _ an estimated 10,000 _ have been encamped in
southern Honduras near the Nicaraguan border since their leaders
signed a temporary cease-fire with the Nicaraguan government in
March 1988. But pockets of Contras remain in northern Nicaragua and
in central Chontales province staging scattered attacks.
   Diaz commands the Sandinista army ``Quilali'' reserve battallion
of the 311th Brigade. Moreno heads a Contra batallion also called
``Quilali.''
   Quilali is the name of a town in northern Nueva Segovia province,
and the meeting took place about six miles north of the town.
   Farina said the Contras appeared to know little of the regional
accord, which Diaz explained to them.
   After Diaz distributed the copies of the accord, the Contras
left, looking over their shoulders as they disappeared into the bush.
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista
National Liberation Front, on Saturday said more than 400 Contras
have left their camps in Honduras and are trying to return to
Nicaragua.
   The daily quoted Jose Tomas Osorio Umanzor, whom it described a
seven-year Contra veteran, as saying more than 400 rebels had
deserted and were wandering around the border trying to enter
Nicaragua.
   Osorio returned to Nicaragua through the Nicaraguan border town
of Las Manos, in Nueva Segovia Province, on Wednesday, according to
Barricada.
   The Nicaraguan Red Cross has set up border offices to receive
Nicaraguans who want to return.

<HEAD>Miami Couple Return Home After Surviving 66 Days Adrift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Miami couple who survived 66 days aboard a life
raft in the Pacific Ocean returned home Saturday looking for a long
rest _ away from the water and their aquatic tormentors.
   William Butler, 59, and Simone Butler, 56, arrived at Miami
International Airport after a seven-week ordeal, during which they
said their boat was sunk by whales and they had to fend off sharks
and subsist on fresh fish and desalinated sea water.
   The couple, each more than 50 pounds lighter after the ordeal,
flew from San Jose, Costa Rica, a week after they were rescued by a
Costa Rican Coast Guard cutter 13 miles off that Central American
nation's coast.
   ``It's hard to believe that seven days ago we were still adrift,
trying to make landfall,'' Butler said. ``Really, it's hard to
discuss the situation.''
   Butler said the most dangerous day on the covered raft was a day
he called ``The Shootout at O.K. Corral.''
   The Butlers that afternoon found themselves in the middle of a
huge school of triggerfish, a small feeding fish. Then came a school
of porpoises and ``about 20 to 30 sharks,'' he said.
   ``They all got in a huge feeding frenzy,'' Butler said, that
ended only about 3 a.m. the next day.
   During the turbulent episode, either a porpoise or a shark got
caught in one of the raft's balast bags, and violently threw the
raft about for a couple of minutes, according to Butler.
   Butler, a retired exporter, looked trim and fit. He wore a bushy
grey beard grown during the sojourn.
   Mrs. Butler, who lost 67 pounds, left the plane in a wheelchair,
but stood up to greet waiting family members and friends and talk
with reporters.
   Among those waiting to meet the Butlers was their 2-month-old
granddaughter, Jessica Butler, who was born after they put to sea.
   The couple was hospitalized in Costa Rica after the rescue.
   ``The first night in the hospital,'' said Mrs. Butler, a native
of France, ``I had a terrible nightmare, and didn't know where I
was. It was a terrible two minutes in the dark before I realized
that I was on land and it was all right.''
   On May 24, the Butlers began a voyage from Panama to Hawaii in
their 40-foot sailboat.
   Nearly three weeks out, whales, apparently seeking to protect
their young, attacked and sank the boat, the couple said.
   `I don't know anything about whale psychology,'' Butler said,
``but I assume we headed into (the whales') pack. The babies were in
front, the mothers behind, then the males.''
   Butler said the male whales attacked the boat, ramming its hull
while making loud chugging sounds ``like a locomotive.'' The couple
sent help signals, grabbed essentials and jumped into the raft as
the craft went down in minutes.
   They managed to escape with six cans of food _ including half a
jar of peanut butter _ the ship's log, a puncture repair kit for the
rubber raft and the crucial fishing line and a portable desalination
filter.
   The canned food held out for 20 days, then they lived on fish
they caught.
   The couple said they sighted dozens of ships during their ordeal,
but weren't seen by the crews.
   The Costa Rican Coast Guard spotted the couple floating in their
life raft Aug. 19.
   ``We're going to rest _ and go away from the ocean for a while,
to the mountains, the prairies,'' Butler said.
   The life-long sailor said he plans to resume sailing ``in about a
year.''
   They said they have received various offers for rights to the
story of their ordeal.
   ``We've already received a lot of offers,'' Butler said. ``Offers
for movie rights, for TV rights, for book rights, for
ghostwriters.'' But ``we've put that all on hold,'' his wife said.

<HEAD>Pravda Slams Unofficial Soviet Press, Says Polish Communists Not
Through</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pravda on Saturday accused several unofficial
newspapers that have sprung up under Kremlin reforms of using
Western funds to press for the overthrow of the Soviet government.
   In another attack on liberal trends, the Communist Party daily
also warned Poles that Polish Communists may have suffered a defeat,
but nobody should write their political obituary.
   Pravda called for a crackdown on publications that carry
``systematic and vicious attacks on our party and its leadership.''
   Among targets of Pravda's censure were papers put out by the
self-styled opposition party Democratic Union, an independent
Siberian news agency and unofficial journalists Lev Timofeyev and
Sergei Grigoryants.
   Their press activities, which once would have brought them
constant harassment and arrests, have flourished despite continuing
obstacles under the Kremlin's policy of glasnost, or more openness.
   Commentator Yuri Zhukov listed among his complaints against the
activist journalists ``truly blasphemous attacks on Lenin,''
including pornographic verses.
   He denounced cooperation between unofficial journalists and
Western radio and press, saying their Western support made them the
equivalent of foreign publications put out without permission on
Soviet territory.
   Zhukov also accused many of the unofficial publications of
pirating their paper supplies and the use of copying facilities.
   Under a law passed July 31, calls for the violent overthrow of
the Soviet government are criminal offenses. An earlier version also
banned statements that ``discredited'' the government, but it was
replaced.
   On Poland, Prava said ``extremist-minded people are hurrying to
write off the Polish United Workers (communist) Party'' following
the election of Soldarity member Tadeusz Mazowiecki as Polish prime
minister.
   The newspaper cautioned that discounting the Communists would be
premature, Pravda cautioned. It said the Communists by right are the
most important group in Polish politics.
   Mazowiecki's election Thursday, with support from many Communist
lawmakers, gave the East bloc is first non-Communist leader since
World War II.
   The Soviet government sent an immediate telegram of
congratulations to Mazowiecki. But Pravda's commentary, the most
authoritative to date, cast doubt on whether Mazowiecki can succeed
in breaking Poland's economic decline.
   ``Is this the way out of the labyrinth?'' the newspaper asked. It
never really answered the question.

<HEAD>US-Soviet Conference Urges Alliance To Fight Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and U.S. scientists, politicians and
entertainers on Saturday urged their governments to forge an
``environmental security alliance'' to combat global warming.
   Actor-filmmaker Robert Redford, who co-sponsored the four-day
conference with the Soviet Academy of Science, read a letter to
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev:
   ``The United States of America and the U.S.S.R. are the two
largest producers of greenhouse gases'' thought to cause global
warming, Redford said.
   ``We should provide the leadership in the search for common
solutions to the global warming problem as well as for the
environmental security of the world.''
   The letter was signed by Redford and space researcher Roald
Segdeev, head of an 11-member Soviet delegation, who said the two
nations must cooperate to undo the environmental damage they have
incurred.
   ``For the crimes we've committed, as humans on the planet, we are
sentenced to do this job. And I think it is a life-long sentence,''
Segdeev said.
   His comments ended the conference of Soviet and American
scientists, political leaders, environmentalists, filmmakers and
authors. Among those attending were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and
Tim Wirth, D-Colo.; Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus; astronomer Carl Sagan,
former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall; and cartoonist Garry
Trudeau.
   The attempt at ``greenhouse glasnost'' was not as much a
scientific conference as it was an attempt to ``pass the baton''
from scientists to policy-shapers in both countries, who need to
take action, Redford said.
   During the conference, scientists predicted that the greenhouse
effect, caused by rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and
other gases produced by industrial societies, could raise global
temperatures by 2 to 10 degrees over the next century. That could
alter worldwide weather patterns and cause the melting of the polar
ice caps, flooding coastal regions.
   To combat the rise of carbon dioxide, much of which comes from
the burning of fossil fuels, the letter proposes the two superpowers
form an ``environmental security alliance'' to:
   _Promote energy-efficient technology.
   _Halt production and use by the year 2000 of chlorofluorocarbons,
another group of greenhouse gases, and ``substantially reduce''
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
   _Reduce the rate of worldwide deforestation and start the
planting of trees in unforested areas.
   The letter was accompanied by a conference report detailing
specific strategies for reducing global warming.
   In the past, Redford's Institute For Resource Management, a
private environmental mediation group based at his Sundance resort
in central Utah, has tackled offshore drilling in the Bering Sea,
the construction of power plants in the Southwest and air quality
issues.

   Trumbull, Conn., became the first
American team since 1983 to win the Little League World Series,
beating Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 5-2 Saturday behind Chris Drury's
five-hitter.
   Drury, a 5-foot-1{, 126-pound right-hander with a 66-mph
fastball, struck out two, walked four _ two intentionally _ and went
2-for-3 at the plate.
   His Texas-leaguer with two outs and the bases loaded in the
fourth inning scored two runs and opened up a 4-1 lead in the
nationally televised game.
   Drury allowed a run in the top of the fifth, but Ken Martin
answered with a solo home run in the bottom of the inning for
Trumbull, a suburb of Bridgeport, Conn. Marietta, Ga., won the World
Series in 1983.
   In the sixth inning, Drury walked the leadoff hitter but ended
the game with a fly out, strikeout and deep fly to left field as
jubiliant teammates rushed to the mound and hugged the winning
pitcher.
   Lee Chien-Chih, an 86-pound right-handed submarine pitcher, was
relieved after Martin's home run to lead off the fifth. Lee allowed
five runs and six hits, struck out three and walked none.
   Saturday's championship culminated about 12,250 tournament games
worldwide involving about 7,000 All-Stars teams of 11- and
12-year-olds. About 2.5 million youngsters in 33 countries
participate in Little League, founded 50 years ago.

   Firefighters brought the blaze under control about 1 a.m.
Saturday, about two hours after it started, said the official.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
   No Americans were believed to be staying at the hotel, most of
whose guests are African immigrant workers.

<TEXT>
   The B-2 stealth bomber ended
the longest and most secretive of its three test flights over the
Mojave Desert on Saturday with a safe landing here, an Air Force
spokeswoman said.
   The bat-like bomber took off at 8:30 a.m. from Edwards Air Force
Base and landed at 1:06 p.m., four hours and 36 minutes later, said
Capt. Tess Taft.
   Brig. Gen. Richard M. Scofield, program director for B-2 System
Program Office called the bomber's third flight a success. ``We are
extremely pleased with today's mission,'' Scofield said in a
statement.
   The B-2's flight Saturday ``was by far the longest, highest and
fastest'' thus far, said Taft.
   The aircraft flew at 25,000 feet and at speeds of up to 300
knots, or about 345 miles per hour, she said. In the previous two
flights, the bomber never exceeded a height of 10,000 feet, a speed
of 180 knots or two hours in the air.
   ``The primary mission was to check out the systems and see how it
flies,'' she said. ``That's what test flights are for, to go a
little bit higher, fly a little bit faster.''
   As in the earlier test flights, the bomber was piloted by Air
Force Col. Richard S. Couch and Northrop chief test pilot Bruce
Hinds, said Taft.
   She did not have any other details about the flight from the
desert air base 55 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   The second test flight of the radar-evading B-2 on Aug. 16 was
cut short in midflight because of a hairline crack in the casing of
an accessory drive. The part powers the $530 million jet's
generators and controls and caused oil pressure to drop, Taft said
Friday.
   The bomber's two-hour maiden flight earlier this summer was
termed a success.
   Unlike the previous two test flights, the Saturday flight was not
announced in advance by the Air Force.
   The government has spent about $22.4 billion in the B-2 program,
which is 18 months behind schedule. Congress has balked at the
thought of paying more than $500 million apiece for 132 bombers.
   Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, Northrop and the Pentagon last
month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes.
   The Pentagon wants $4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming
fiscal year, and it may need $8 billion in each of the three years

   Engineers say that the use of composite materials, combined with
the bomber's shape and smooth leading edges, give it a tiny radar
signature, making it nearly impossible for current Soviet systems to
detect.

   The military government announced Saturday
it will allow six universities to reopen Oct. 30, four months after
they were closed because of student riots.
   The six universities had been ordered closed for a year, but
Education Minister Jubril Aminu said the Armed Forces Ruling Council
had decided to accede to pleas by religious and education leaders.
   He said the six universities would be required to skip vacations
to make up for lost time, and students must agree to pay for damage
to university property. He said parents of all enrolled students
will be held responsible for further misconduct.
   A total of 23 university and vocational colleges were ordered
shut immeditately after students and others rioted in June against
strict austerity measures imposed by the government. At least 43
people died in the violence.
   The government has refused to retreat from the austerity program,
required by Western creditors, saying there is no alternative. But
it announced a package of relief measures, including some wage
increases.
   The universities to reopen are in Lagos, Benin, Ibadan, Ekpoma
and Okigwe.

   A jury Saturday began deliberating the fate of
Leona Helmsley, who is accused of avoiding taxes by charging
personal expenses to her hotel business.
   The Manhattan federal court jury, which received the case after a
two-month trial at which 48 witnesses testified, deliberated more
than eight hours before breaking for the day. The jurors, who are
sequestered, planned to return at 10:30 a.m. Sunday.
   Soon after they began deliberations, jury foreman Alvin Taylor, a
postal worker, sent out a note asking for 11 copies of the judge's
instruction on the law and the ``court journal.''
   Judge John Walker Jr., who had already given them one copy of the
charge, which he had read to them Friday, refused to supply them
with more. He explained that jurors should do their thinking as a
whole and that he did not want individual jurors reading from
different parts of his instructions.
   Walker also declined to give them the court journal, which he
deduced was the entire trial transcript. He told the jurors that
they would have to ask for testimony from specific witnesses or
about specific issues.
   Later, they sent another note asking for the Helmsleys' personal
tax returns for 1983-85 and a folder of all the records of money
spent on the Helmsleys' Connecticut estate, Dunnellen Hall.
   The jurors also asked for documents pertaining to the moving
expenses of the former houskeeper at the estate, Elizabeth Baum. The
government contends that her moving costs, almost $4,000, were paid
for by the Park Lane Hotel.
   During the deliberations, Mrs. Helmsley chatted with her lawyers
and the reporters covering the trial. She appeared relaxed and
smiled frequently.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, has been on trial for eight weeks on charges
she evaded $1.2 million in federal taxes by charging personal
expenses, including renovations at her Connecticut estate, to her
businesses.
   Former aides Frank Turco and Joseph Licari, who are co-defendants
at the trial, are charged with assisting in the scheme.
   Mrs. Helmsley and Turco also are charged with conspiring to
extort payoffs and merchandise from vendors doing business with the
Helmsley organization.
   Mrs. Helmsley's 80-year-old husband, Harry, was charged in the
indictment but was severed because he was found to be mentally
incompetent.

   Florida's second statewide crack crackdown this
summer captured more than 2,100 suspects _ from teen-agers to an
82-year-old man _ and more than doubled the number of crack rocks
confiscated, authorities said Saturday.
   The greater quantity of crack seized in ``Operation Rock Pile
II'' indicates police arrested more dealers than in the first
roundup, Broward County sheriff's spokesman George Crolius said.
   An estimated 1,200 officers in all of the state's 67 counties
arrested 2,117 suspects during the 48 hours ending midnight Friday,
compared with 2,076 arrests in the two-day operation begun June 30.
   The second roundup produced 9,507 crack cocaine ``rocks'' _
individual chunks of crack ready for smoking _ as well as 2.73
pounds of cocaine powder, 12.72 pounds of marijuana, 75 firearms,
327 vehicles and more than $70,000 in cash, Crolius said by
telephone from the operation command post in Fort Lauderdale.
   The first ``Operation Rock Pile'' netted 3,510 crack cocaine
rocks, 10 pounds of cocaine powder, 3 pounds of marijuana, 50
firearms, 327 vehicles and $55,000 cash.
   The operations' main objective was to ``get as much crack off the
street as we can,'' said another sheriff's spokesman, Jim Leljedal.
   In Pompano Beach, Frank Wilcher, 82, was among those arrested,
Crolius said.
   Wilcher, who had a substantial amount of crack rocks, cash and
several firearms in his house, was charged with trafficking in
cocaine, and could face a life sentence if convicted, Crolius said.
   ``It's an enticement to all members of our society, the lure of
easy money from the sale of crack rocks,'' said Crolius.
   The crackdown, coordinated by the Florida Sheriffs' Association,
combined reverse sting and ``Trojan Horse'' operations with search
warrants and highway surveillance.
   Undercover officers in reverse stings pose as drug sellers and
arrest customers. In ``Trojan Horse'' operations, deputies hidden in
the back of a van jump out and arrest street corner dealers when
they offer crack for sale to the van's driver.

<HEAD>Catholic Church Leader Urges Jews to Stop Being anti-Polish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Primate Jozef Glemp on
Saturday urged Jews worldwide to stop being anti-Polish in his first
comment on the controversy surrounding a convent at Auschwitz death
camp.
   ``Let us start a dialogue in honesty and in truth,'' said
Cardinal Glemp, leader of Poland's Catholic Church. ``If there would
be no `anti-Polonism,' there will be no anti-Semitism in our
country.''
   He spoke to thousands of pilgrims at Jasna Gora Monastery in the
southern city of Czestochowa on the holiday honoring the Black
Madonna, Poland's most revered Catholic icon.
   Glemp was responding to international criticism of the church's
Aug. 10 abrogation of a 1987 promise to move the convent from the
perimeter of the former Nazi camp.
   Many Jewish groups consider the convent an intrusion at the site
where more than 2.5 million Jews were killed by the Nazis. Three
million of the 3.5 million Jews in Poland at World War II were
killed in the Holocaust.
   Most survivors fled immediately after and in another wave after a
government-led anti-Semitic purge in 1968, leaving the Jewish
population here today at only several thousand.
   Glemp, in coments reported by the PAP state news agency, said:
   ``Have there been animosities and adventures against Jews in
Poland? Yes, there have. Have there been Jews in Poland,
businessmen, who neglected and detested Poles? Yes. Were there
Jewish collaborators during the (Nazi) occupation who did not grow
into the heroic defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto? Yes.''
   He also noted Jews were among Polish soldiers killed at the siege
of Monte Cassino in Italy and at Katyn in the Soviet Union.
   ``The brotherhood of common martyrdom has extraordinary
significance ... So why has the problem of Auschwitz and the convent
of the Carmelite nuns been born? Why has it exploded so suddenly 40
years after putting out the crematoria?'' he asked.
   ``Dialogue is needed ... The systematic explanation of difficult
things, not of putting forth demands,'' Glemp said.
   ``The Carmelite nuns living beside the camp site in Oswiecim
wanted and want to be a symbol of the human solidarity which covers
the living and the dead.
   ``Can't you see, dear Jews, that acting against them offends the
feelings of all Poles and our sovereignty ...
   ``Your power is the mass media at easy disposal in many
countries. Don't let them serve to kindle anti-Polonism.''
   Referring to seven American Jews who climbed a fence at the
convent July 14 and occupied the convent yard before being roughly
dragged out by workmen, Glemp said, ``Don't call the (Jewish)
assailants heroes.''
   He also urged Jews to distinguish between the Auschwitz camp,
where he said mainly Poles were killed, and the nearby Birkenau
camp, run from a Nazi headquarters at Auschwitz, where mainly Jews
died.

<TEXT>
   The State Department, citing Colombia's massive
crackdown on drug traffickers, issued a travel warning Saturday
night and asked Americans to postpone trips to that South American
nation.
   ``Due to recent events, Colombia's security situation is
unsettled and likely to remain so in the near future,'' a statement
read by State Department spokesman Adam Shub said. ``The government
of Colombia's aggressive actions against narcotics traffickers could
raise the level of violence in some areas and American citizens,
even though not specifically targeted, could find themselves caught
up in random violence.''
   An unprecedented crackdown is underway in Colombia following the
recent murder of a highly popular presidential candidate, Luis
Carlos Galan. The Colombians have confiscated millions of dollars in
goods and made mass arrests.
   ``The Department of State recommends that non-essential travel to
Colombia be postponed for at least several weeks, pending
clarification of the security situation. Those who deem their travel
essential should contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota or the U.S.
Consulate in Barranquilla immediately upon arrival,'' the statement
said.
   Shub said the travel warning was issued following a decision by
the U.S. Embassy in Colombia to limit travel to the country. He said
it was a ``precautionary measure'' aimed at reducing ``the demands
on the embassy security staff.''
   ``There is no evidence of a specific threat against either
official or private Americans, but given the heightened level of
confrontation between the Colombian authorities and drug
traffickers, we believe it is prudent for U.S. citizens to avoid
non-essential travel,'' Shub said.

   Voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny
``moonlets'' hidden in one of Neptune's two brightest rings, and
also found three more rings orbiting the planet, NASA said Saturday.
   Voyager's scientists also reported the solar system's
fourth-largest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a
tilted magnetic field, and may have an aurora like Earth's northern
and southern lights.
   The researchers said nitrogen _ the gas that makes up 78 percent
of Earth's atmosphere _ is the main component in the skies of
Triton, the frosty Neptunian moon sculpted with faults, cliffs, pink
snow, meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed
viscous ice instead of molten rock. Methane, or natural gas, is
present as well, they said.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Sunday, Voyager will be 2.29 million miles from
Neptune, speeding away from the planet at 37,689 mph. The probe will
be 2.75 billion miles from Earth. Voyager traveled a curving
4.43-billion-mile path to achieve Thursday night's close encounter
with Neptune and Friday morning's flight past Triton.
   ``We have five rings at Neptune,'' including the two bright ones
found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones, said Bradford
Smith, leader of the Voyager photographic imaging team at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Smith said later the boundaries between the five rings aren't
well defined, so there could be as few as three rings or as many as
five. He reversed himself later Saturday, deciding the rings are
distinct enough to count the total as five.
   A bright ring discovered Aug. 11 initially appeared to be a
partial ring, called a ring arc, but proved to be a complete ring.
Six to eight icy objects _ the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12
miles wide _ are embedded in that ring, Smith said.
   ``You could refer to them as moonlets,'' he said.
   Smith said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring
has a clumpy appearance, with some segments wider than others.
   So far, Voyager has discovered six objects orbiting Neptune that
are large enough to be called moons. That brings the total to eight
moons, including Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth.
   The ring containing the moonlets remains Neptune's outermost
ring. Next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring,
followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad, diffuse
band of dust. Then comes the other ring discovered earlier. Closest
to Neptune is the third newly discovered ring, a broad, diffuse band
of dust NASA said was 1,550 miles wide.
   The initial confusion over the number of Neptune's rings is
reminiscent of what happened at Uranus in 1986. Ten thin rings were
apparent as Voyager neared Uranus. But after the spacecraft passed
that planet, a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible
when backlit by the sun. As a result, scientists still are arguing
how many distinct rings orbit Uranus.
   Researchers said Saturday that Voyager also found:
   _Neptune's magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away
from the poles around which the planet rotates. Earth's magnetic
axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis, putting one
magnetic pole in northern Canada about 1,000 miles from the true, or
rotational, north pole.
   _The planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than
the Van Allen belts encircling Earth. The radiation belt's location
near the orbit of Triton may explain the pinkish hue of some of the
moon's surface. Radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas
that color.
   Deputy Voyager project scientist Ellis Miner said there is
evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that, at 30 degrees south
latitude, Neptune has an aurora similar to Earth's northern and
southern lights. Other scientists Saturday refused to discuss the
evidence, saying it was too preliminary.
   If the aurora proves real, Neptune's tilted magnetic field would
explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planet's
equator rather than the rotational poles.
   Auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar
wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines. On Earth,
they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational
poles are relatively close.
   Voyager continued Saturday to send back recorded photographs
taken during its Neptune-Triton flyby, including its most detailed
photos of Triton.
   The spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global
temperature map of Neptune, search for auroras and more rings, and
study the weight of Neptune and Triton.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Until Oct. 2, Voyager 2 will look
back at Neptune. Then it will head toward interstellar space,
looking for the edge of the solar system.

   Voyager 2's Neptune encounter marks the
last planetary flyby by a U.S. spacecraft, but missions to Venus,
Jupiter and Mars mean America will keep exploring space, a NASA
official said Saturday.
   ``We are embarking on the second golden age of space science,''
said Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to launch
35 space science flights in the next five years _ the highest launch
rate ever _ and U.S. spacecraft will be exploring planets
continuously from next year until 2006, Fisk said during a visit to
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Fisk was at the lab to watch Voyager 2's brush with Neptune last
Thursday night _ the probe's final encounter after it explored
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   ``In many ways, this is the end of an era, the last time we will
see a planet for a first time, the end of the reconnaissance phase
of planetary explorations,'' he said. There are no plans to explore
Pluto, the only planet still not visited by a spacecraft
   But Fisk listed several missions that will orbit planets rather
than fly past them:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, arrives at
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo will be launched from the shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 12,
arriving in orbit around Jupiter in 1996 and studying the planet
until the end of the century.
   _The Hubble Space Telescope is due for launch from a shuttle next
March, and is so powerful that from its orbit around Earth it will
be able to ``observe the universe back to the beginning of time,''
Fisk said.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992, reaching the red planet
in 1993 and studying it until 1996.
   _NASA has asked Congress to approve the Comet Rendevous-Asteroid
Flyby and Cassini missions, Fisk said. CRAF would fly past an
asteroid, then orbit a comet from 2000 through 2002, Fisk said. The
similar spacecraft on the Cassini mission would drop a probe onto
Saturn's moon Titan, then orbit Saturn from 2002 through 2006.
   Fisk disputed assertions that unmanned space exploration will
suffer financially because of the shuttle program, saying that 70
percent to 80 percent of non-military shuttle flights will be
dedicated to space science.
   Fisk said space science studies suffered in recent years not from
a lack of funds, but because of delays in developing the shuttle and
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and halted
launches until last fall.

   More than 15,000 Roman Catholics
celebrated the consecration Saturday of the first archbishop of
Olomouc in 16 years, the Austrian-based Catholic news agency
Kathpress reported.
   It said 6,000 people watched the consecration of Frantisek Vanak
by Bishop Antonin Liska of Prague on a giant movie screen set in
front of Olomouc Cathedral because the church could not contain the
crowd. Olomouc is 120 miles east of Prague.
   Vanak, 73, in July was elevated from parish priest to bishop.
   Thirteen dioceses remain without bishops in Czechoslovakia,
reflecting strained relations between the Vatican and the communist
leadership.
   Many have been vacant for decades because the two sides cannot
agree on candidates.
   The government prefers clergymen who are members of Pacem im
Terris, an organization usually subservient to the state.
Independent priests frequently complain of official harassment.
   The Vatican says 60 percent of Czechoslovakia's 15 million people
are Catholic.

   A 22-year-old mechanic for Continental Airlines
was critically injured when she was run over by the wheel of a

   The employee, Hope Lewellen of Orland Park, may have lost one leg

   She was in critical condition, conscious but heavily sedated,
when she was taken into surgery at about 6 p.m., said the

   Ms. Lewellen had been directing a Scandinavian Airlines Boeing
767 jumbo jet into a gate for a 5 p.m. departure to Stockholm when
she was run over by a wheel after leaning down to pick up earphones
that had fallen off her head, police said. The jet was moving
backwards at the time.
   Continental employees were the only ones aboard at the time of
the accident, said Scandinavian Airlines spokeswoman Marj Abrams.
   Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration were
investigating the accident, said FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein.

<TEXT>
   The 14-party opposition coalition on
Saturday announced a platform for February elections focusing on
Nicaragua's economic crisis but offering no details of a promised
austerity budget.
   The National Opposition Union also promised legal title to
peasants given land under Sandinista agrarian reforms and
compensation for those whose land was confiscated.
   It pledges several improved social programs but does not mention
the tough measures any Nicaraguan government would need to take to
halt inflation and increase production.
   A coalition ``Government of National Salvation'' would institute
an austerity budget, the platform says without detailing specifics.
   President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government already is taking
some measures. In January, it fired 30,000 public employees, cut its
budget by more than 40 percent and slashed investments to combat
inflation that topped 33,000 percent last year.
   But the Sandinistas have failed to create a climate of confidence
in the private sector to encourage production. Confiscating land as
punishment for political opposition is among Sandinista measures
that have antagonized private business and lowered production.
   That is one area marked for change by the coalition, which spans
a broad spectrum of ideologies range from communist to conservative.
   Its platform envisions less state control of the domestic and
export markets, more foreign investment and a freeing of the economy.
   It also mentions in several places its intent to separate the
armed forces from politics and reduce the size of the 200,000-strong
army _ the largest in Central America.
   The coalition said it will announce its candidates for president
and vice president next week. Coalition members still must decide
the procedure for choosing the candidates.
   Likeliest choices for their presidential candidate are Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, whose family owns the opposition newspaper La
Prensa; businessman Enrique Bolanos Geyer, and Independent Liberal
Party leader Virgilio Godoy.

   Three off-duty sheriff's deputies were
found shot to death in a murder-suicide blamed on an apparent love
triangle, a sheriff's spokesman said Saturday.
   Investigators believe Senior Deputy Gary Vest, 33, shot his
estranged wife, Deputy Shirley Vest, 40, a booking officer, and Sgt.
Richard Crocker, 42, whom she was living with, before killing
himself, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Deputy Bob Morgan said.
   Mrs. Vest and Crocker apparently were living together in Pinon
Hills, about 45 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, he said.
   A sheriff's deputy discovered the bodies at the home about 2:30
a.m. Saturday, Morgan said. He was sent to investigate after the
sergeant and booking officer failed to show up for work at midnight
Friday and numerous calls to the home went unanswered.
   The bodies of the Vests were found in the front room, near a 9mm
pistol believed used in the killings, Morgan said. Crocker's body
was in the kitchen.
   Although the exact time of the killings had not been determined,
investigators believed they occurred sometime Friday evening, Morgan
said.
   The Vests had been married a little more than a year, but had
been separated several months, he said. It was not immediately known
how long Mrs. Vest had been living with Crocker.

police spokesman Sgt. Ed Burns.
   All but $1,050 of the stolen money was recovered from an
apartment where Warner's girlfriend lived, said Burns.
   Warner's friend, Cuthbert Joseph, was also arrested Friday for
allegedly helping Warner, Burns said. The guard, Billy Hackworth,
30, died Saturday morning at Jacobi Hospital.
   Warner fabricated the initial version of the robbery Tuesday
outside a Marine Midland Savings Bank in the Hunts Point section of
the Bronx, Burns said. Warner claimed two men and a woman staged a
traffic accident to get him to open the truck door.
   Sgt. Frank Viggiano, who led the police investigation, said after
questioning Warner and giving him a polygraph test, the suspect was
confronted with inconsistencies in his story.
   ``He then made some statements implicating himself in the
crime,'' Viggiano said.
   The .38-caliber handgun used in the shooting was recovered in
Joseph's apartment, Burns said.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 people protested in
downtown Taipei Saturday to demand the government curb real estate
prices, which are soaring because of rampant speculation.
   The protesters, claiming they could never afford buying their own
homes under current prices, briefly sat down on several downtown
streets during the three-hour demonstration.
   Lee Hsin-chang, who heads the Houseless People's Union that
organized the demonstration, told the crowd, ``A house is not a
commerical product to be speculated. It is our basic right to own a
house.''
   Organizers cited a government report that says a Taipei apartment
was sold for an average of $460,000 last year, and it would take 19
years of an average family's entire income to buy one. Housing costs
have increased more than 200 percent since 1987.
   The protesters demanded the government establish rent control and
restrict insurance and investment firms from buying houses to quick
resale. They want more public housing and low-interest loans to
first-time buyers.
   Interior Minister Hsu Shui-teh told the Houseless People's
Association Friday the government would consider building more
public housing in suburban areas and setting rental ceilings.

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion Protesters Arrested; Abortion Rights Group Marches</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   More than 180 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested Saturday
during protests in Kansas, Missouri and New Jersey, while 400 people
marched six miles in Atlantic City to demand that politicians
support abortion rights.
   In New Jersey, 137 anti-abortion advocates were arrested in a
demonstration that forced the temporary closing of a Cherry Hill
abortion clinic. Police in Columbia, Mo., arrested 44 anti-abortion
demonstrators who blocked the doors to a Planned Parenthood clinic
for nearly four hours Saturday.
   On the opposite side of the issue, 400 pro-choice demonstrators
turned out for a six-mile walk-a-thon along the Atlantic City
boardwalk. The event was sponsored by the National Organization for
Women and NOW-New Jersey to raise money for the state chapter's
Political Action Committee.
   National NOW President Molly Yard said the march in New Jersey
helped identify candidates for the state Legislature who support the
right to an abortion and would get the word to voters.
   ``Voters in this country do believe that it's up to a woman to
decide what happens to her body,'' Ms. Yard said.
   Referring to the Supreme Court's decision this summer giving
states the right to regulate abortion, Ms. Yard said: ``American
women are very mad about what happened, and they're not going to
take it any more. And there are a lot of men who support that.''
   About 200 anti-abortion advocates protested outside the Cherry
Hill Women's Center early Saturday morning. Those arrested were
charged with defiant trespassing for blocking the center's
entrances, said Police Sgt. Edward Morton.
   At the Columbia, Mo., clinic, police charged the ``Operation
Rescue'' members, most from the Kansas City area, with trespassing
and released them on their own recognizance, said Deputy Chief
Carroll Highbarger.
   Several abortion-rights activists held a counter-demonstration.
``They yelled back and forth, but that was it,'' Highbarger said.
   Women waiting for abortions or to pick up birth control goods
remained in a parking lot across the street until the clinic opened,
said India McCanse, the clinic's community affairs director. Some
were upset, but none left, she said.
   The clinic performs 10 to 12 abortions on a typical Saturday,
McCanse said.
   In the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kan., three people
who attempted to block the entrance to the Comprehensive Health for
Women clinic also were arrested on trespassing charges Saturday.
   Lt. Steve Ford said the three were released on their own
recognizance.

<HEAD>Perez Makes Cabinet Changes; New Foreign, Health Ministers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Andres Perez asked his
entire Cabinet to resign and Saturday announced a new body of
advisers, naming a new foreign minister but keeping his economic
team.
   A Presidential Palace spokesman confirmed Perez's close friend,
Reinaldo Figueredo, is replacing Enrique Tejera Paris as foreign
minister.
   He also said Finance Minister Eglee Iturbe and Energy Minister
Celestino Armas will keep their portfolios.
   ``The decision has been taken not to make any changes in the
economic Cabinet posts,'' the spokesman told reporters at the
central town of Miraflores.
   Perez praised the outgoing Cabinet in his statement but said it
was time for a ``reorganization'' _ the first since he was
inaugurated Feb. 2.
   In other changes, Agriculture Minister Fanny Bello was replaced
by Raul de Armas, Transport Minister Gustavo Rada by Elias Osuna and
Health Minister Felipe Bello by Manuel Adrianza.
   The palace spokesman said no changes will be made in the state
oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., which provides more than
90 percent of Venezuela's foreign exchange earnings.
   New ministers will be sworn in Sunday, when the 2.8 million
members of the governing Democratic Action Party hold nationwide
primaries to choose candidates for December gubernatorial and
municipal elections.
   This is the first time Venezuelans will vote for governors of the
20 states and two federal territories, who previously were appointed
by the president.
   The most significant change announced Saturday, naming Figueredo
to the Foreign Ministry, comes after Venezuela suffered a
humiliating diplomatic defeat Thursday, when the Organization of
American States decided to suspend its mediation in Panama.
   Perez is a highly vocal foe of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
de facto leader of Panama. Venezuela had sponsored a strongly worded
resolution against Noriega, only to see it watered down by other
organization members to a point where it no longer called for
Noriega's departure from power.

<HEAD>Research Spurs New Expedition to Find Earhart Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new expedition spurred by the
theory of two retired military fliers is planned next month to try
to solve the mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance.
   The pioneering aviatrix and her navigator, Fred Noonan, vanished
52 years ago in the South Pacific on a 2,556-mile leg of their
attempted flight around the world.
   The Pensacola News Journal reported Saturday that two men from
this Florida Panhandle city, Tom Willi, 62, a former Navy pilot, and
Tom Gannon, 69, who had been an Air force navigator, have persuaded
The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, or TIGHAR,
that they had the navigation clues to solve the mystery.
   The organization plans to send a 20-member expedition that will
include Willi and Gannon to the Fiji Islands on Sept. 4, said
Richard Gillespie, executive director and search team leader for the
group based in Wilmington, del.
   There have been numerous theories to explain Ms. Earhart's
disappearance, including speculation that she was captured by the
Japanese and executed as a spy. Willi and Gannon believe she may
have come down on Nikumaroro Island, then known as Gardner Island,
about 1,000 miles south of Fiji. They base their theory on a study
of her flight plan and other information.
   They contend winds may have blown the plane southeast of its
destination, Howland Ilsand, toward Nikumaroro. With only two hours
of fuel left, Ms. Earhart and Noonan decided to fly south toward
Nikumaroro because they knew there were no other islands to the
north of their flight path within range of their remaining fuel,
Willi and Gannon contend.
   ``We're just amazed that nobody ever figured this out before,''
Gannon said. ``The whole thing was a navigation problem. I guess it
took two navigators to hopefully solve it.''
   Although it had been widely thought the Navy searched the island,
Willi and Gannon said they found out that float planes from the
battleship USS Colorado flew over but no search party ever landed
there.
   They say have other clues, including the reported 1938 discovery
on the island of a female skeleton wearing American shoes. Ms.
Earhart and Noonan disappeared on July 2, 1937.
   In the four days after they vanished, radio operators at
different locations picked up 24 transmissions made in a female
voice and on Ms. Earhart's frequency. When plotted, the
transmissions cross at Nikumaroro, Willi and Gannon say.
   ``We have always stayed away from the Amelia Earhart thing,''
Gillespie said. ``We're a non-profit aviation archaeological
foundation, and there are so many theories about Amelia Earhart that
aren't credible.''
   Gillespie said, however, that he changed his mind after spending
a day with Willi and Gannon as they unraveled clues based mainly on
celestial navigation techniques that he described as a lost art.
Those techniques, he said, are what Ms. Earhart and Noonan relied
upon in the days before electronic navigation systems.
   The expedition is expected to last through the first week of
October and cost up to $250,000.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Reached in Ohio Bell Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.R. KROPKO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Striking Ohio Bell telephone workers reached a
tentative agreement Saturday on a contract, but picket lines will
likely stay up until other strikes against Chicago-based Ameritech
are settled, officials said.
   After a brief session Saturday afternoon at a downtown hotel,
negotiators returned a few hours later and signed the agreement _ a
three-year contract that covers about 10,100 workers.
   But the Communications Workers of America, which called for a
strike against Ohio Bell just after midnight on Aug. 13, urged its
Ohio Bell locals to stay off the job and on the picket lines until
five other labor disputes in the Ameritech system are resolved.
   Ameritech includes Ohio Bell, Indiana Bell, Illinois Bell,
Wisconsin Bell, Michigan Bell and the regional Ameritech Services
Inc.
   Nationally, 200,000 workers in 20 states went on strike earlier
this month against four regional telephone companies. Union leaders
have negotiated tentative settlements with striking employees at
Pacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada; and Bell
Atlantic, which covers West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., and New Jersey.
   In New York, NYNEX Corp. said Friday it had agreed to resume
bargaining with its striking workers for the first formal talks
since that walkout started almost three weeks ago.
   Terms of the Ohio Bell settlement were not revealed. A main issue
in the impasse was whether a pay increase should be given in a lump
sum, as the company wished, or put into base-pay schedules, as the
union sought.
   ``We feel that we have a very fair and innovative agreement,''
said Ted Garrison, Ohio Bell's assistant vice president for labor
relations and the company's chief contract negotiator.
   ``We feel we have done some good work in terms of wages and
benefits, family care and other issues. We feel we have positioned
both the Ohio Bell telephone company and the employees for the
1990s,'' Garrison said.
   Communications Workers of America staff represtative David Derrig
said the union will not reveal specifics until the agreement is
ratified, which he estimated would take up to a week.
   Ohio Bell provides service to about 2.5 million homes and
businesses in about two-thirds of the state.
   Some 3,000 Ohio Bell administrators and supervisors have
attempted to maintain the company's business and customer services
during the strike.

<HEAD>Government Closes Opposition Party Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government closed down three
opposition party newspapers Saturday and said it will arrest their
editors and confiscate equipment used to publish them.
   A statement from the Government and Justice Ministry said the
newspapers were published ``to slander and damage leaders of the
national government and its institutions, following the lines of
American imperialism in its aggression against the fatherland.''
   The three newspapers are published by the Authentic Liberal and
Christian Democratic parties and the Liberal Republican Nationalist
Movement.
   All three are among opposition parties calling for the ouster of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who as chief of the Defense Forces
wields the real power in Panama.
   No arrests were reported Saturday. Opposition leaders did not
immediately comment on the order.
   The communique said the publications violated news media laws but
did not detail alleged offenses.
   It ordered ``the arrest of any person who irresponsibly edits and
sells'' the newspapers.
   ``Far from orienting national public opinion, they do no more
than plant hatred and bitterness in the Panamanian family,'' it said.
   Tension between the government and opposition has been increasing
in recent days. On Friday, the civilian government's term of office
expires.
   The opposition refused a government offer to share power in a
civilian-military junta.
   Foreign observers said the opposition won May 7 elections by a
landslide, but Noriega annulled the balloting. The opposition
demands the May 7 elections be recognized and that Noriega leave.
The government has refused.
   The United States has imposed economic sanctions in an effort to
get Noriega to turn over power. Noriega was indicted by Florida
grand juries on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. He
denies the charges.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet warships are tentatively scheduled to
visit San Diego sometime next summer in the first such naval port
visit to the West Coast, a newspaper reported.
   The San Diego Union on Saturday quoted unnamed State Department
and Navy sources as saying the visit will be part of a military
exchange program to include a port visit by U.S. warships to the
Soviet city of Vladivostok.
   No exact date has been set for either visit, the sources said.
   ``We have agreed in principle to a Pacific exchange,'' said a
senior State Department official who works with a State
Department-Defense Department interagency council that proposed the
visits.
   ``We offered the Soviets visits to either San Diego or Honolulu.
It will be San Diego because the Soviets want to visit the U.S.
mainland, and they offered us Vladivostok,'' the Union quoted the
official as saying.
   The newspaper said the official requested anonymity pending a
formal announced by the White House next year.
   The visits would be the second round in a new naval exchange
program created by Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, the Soviet
chief of staff.
   In July, three Soviet warships spent five days at the Norfolk,
Va., Naval Base. Earlier this month, three American warships
carrying about 1,200 sailors visited Sevastopol in the Crimea.

   A car exploded in the Armenian capital of Yerevan,
spewing a ``pillar of fire'' into the air but injuring no one,
Pravda reported Saturday.
   ``There was explosive material in the car,'' the Communist Party
daily said without specifying whether police consider Friday's blast
an accident or intentional car bomb.
   Tensions have run high in Armenia and the neighboring Caucasus
republic of Azerbaijan for 1{ years over the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh. More than 90 Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been
killed in unrest and Nagorno-Karabakh has been wracked by strikes,
curfews and frequent armed clashes. The territory is in
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan but is claimed by Armenia, which
like Nagorno-Karabakh is overwhelmingly Christian.
   Pravda's brief report did not link the Yerevan explosion to
festering ethnic tension.
   It said only that an investigation is under way into the blast,
and rifle bullets were found in the car's twisted wreckage.

   The sixth named tropical storm of the Atlantic
season formed off the African coast Saturday as its predecessor,
Erin, withered in cooler northern waters, forecasters said.
   Felix, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, was expected to
intensify as it moved westward, according to forecasters at the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Saturday, Felix's center was near 17.7 north
latitude and 24.1 west longitude, or about 90 miles northwest of Sal
in the Cape Verde Islands, moving toward the west at about 8 mph.
   Erin, which was downgraded from a hurricane on Saturday, was
centered near 53.0 north latitude and 30.5 west longitude, or about
800 miles west of Ireland, at 10:30 p.m. EDT and moving toward the
northeast near 35 mph.
   Erin's strongest winds were clocked at 55 mph and a continued
decrease in strength was forecast.
   Erin posed no threat to land and was expected to lose its
tropical characteristics as it moved over colder waters, the center
said.
   ``It looks like it's going downhill,'' said meteorologist Jack
Beven. The center predicted the storm was heading somewhere between
Greenland and Ireland.
   Erin was the third hurricane of the Atlantic season, which runs
from June 1 to Nov. 30. Spawned off the African coast, it reached
hurricane strength Tuesday, three days after becoming a named storm.
   A tropical depression becomes a named storm when sustained winds
reach 39 mph and a hurricane if winds climb to 74 mph.
   In the Pacific Ocean, meanwhile, Hurricane Kiko roared toward
northern Mexico's Pacific coast Saturday, packing winds near 110
mph. Residents of Baja California Sur were bracing for the storm.

   A fisherman won a $7,700 settlement from
Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. after filing a complaint in
small claims court that he lost wages because of the nation's
largest oil spill.
   Chris Daniels, 38, filed a $4,800 claim against each company
March 27, three days after the tanker Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef
in Prince William Sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   On Friday, a five-hour conference in the office of Anchorage
District Court Judge Glen Anderson ended with Exxon and Alyeska
writing $7,700 in checks to Daniels. He dropped his demand for a
letter of apology from Don Cornett, the head of Exxon in Alaska.
   Daniels said he lost nearly $10,000 because the oil spill left
fishermen unable to fish, and left him without people for whom to
hang nets. His earnings would have allowed him to rent a boat for a
fishing venture that would have generated $100,000, he said.
   Daniels said he went to court because Exxon made him a
take-it-or-leave-it offer of only $500. An Exxon attorney said the
company had trouble getting paperwork from Daniels.
   The corporations argued in court papers that Daniels, a Cordova
resident, raised issues too complicated to be decided by a
magistrate there. They requested that the case be dismissed.
   Daniels resisted and threatened to subpoena oil industry
executives to the Prince William Sound fishing town. The
corporations then asked that a settlement conference be held in
Anchorage, with Daniels on the telephone in Cordova 150 miles away.
   He chose to catch a flight to Anchorage and appeared at the
courthouse Friday.

   Italy lifted import quotas on some Japanese goods
Saturday in the first of a series of steps to liberalize trade

   Ruggiero's action is the first in a four-stage plan to liberalize

ceramics, in January 1991 on Japanese film products and a year later
those on steel products and tires.
   Saturday's decree also lifted quotas on cutlery, motors except
those for cars, batteries and different kinds of toys.

comments. CORRECTS trial length from four to five weeks. Pickup 7th pvs,

<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Saturday night
declared independence militant Filiberto Ojeda Rios innocent of all
charges filed against him for shooting at FBI agents during his 1985
arrest.
   ``This has been a historic verdict. A message of powerful content
to the United States government,'' Ojeda Rios told hundreds of
well-wishers outside the federal building. ``I was tried by their
court ... but by Puerto Ricans, and they lost!''
   But U.S. District Judge Carmen Consuelo Vargas de Cerezo said she
could not free Ojeda Rios since he still is wanted in Hartford,
Conn., for his alleged part in a $7 million Wells Fargo robbery
there in 1983.
   Defense attorney Luis Camacho said Ojeda Rios probably will be
transferred to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in eastern Puerto Rico,
and eventually be flown to Hartford.
   The 12-member jury issued the verdict after more than four hours'
deliberation.
   Ojeda Rios, self-proclaimed leader of the pro-independence
Macheteros underground group, had faced charges for shooting at
federal agents during his 1985 arrest at his home in Luquillo,
Puerto Rico. FBI agent Abelardo Alba was slightly injured when
struck by a bullet fragment in the eye.
   The five-week trial, in which Ojeda Rios defended himself, ended
Thursday.
   The jury dropped all eight charges, including assault, illegal
arms possession and preventing federal agents from carrying out an
arrest.
   Ojeda Rios claimed he acted in self-defense when he opened fire
with his Uzi submachine gun, alleging the FBI agents who raided his
home shooting their weapons intended to kill him.
   ``I could reach no other conclusion,'' Ojeda Rios told the jury.
``They tried to assassinate me.''
   He said he had been under FBI surveillance for weeks and could
have been arrested at any time, making the raid unnecessary.
   Ojeda Rios acknowledged he burned documents moments before the
federal agents burst into his apartment, but said it was to protect
the identity of other Puerto Rican independence militants.
   U.S. District Attorney Daniel Lopez Romo told the jury that those
activists were not ``innocent believers in the noble ideal of
independence.'' He said Ojeda Rios burned the documents to protect
Puerto Ricans involved in illegal activities.
   During the trial, FBI witnesses claimed they warned Ojeda Rios to
surrender before deciding to raid the apartment.
   The FBI arrested Ojeda Rios and several other Macheteros members
in an islandwide sweep on Aug. 30, 1985.
   Sixteen Puerto Ricans allegedly took part in the Wells Fargo
robbery, including seven who were sentenced earlier this year. The
State Department claims the main suspect in the robbery, Wells Fargo
security guard Victor Gerena, escaped to Cuba with part of the loot.
   Ojeda Rios is expected to stand trial on the robbery charges at a
later date.
   The trial came in the midst of heated debate of the island's
relationship with the United States, which took control of Puerto
Rico after the 1898 Spanish-American war.
   Draft legislation for a 1991 plebiscite on the island's future
recently has been prepared. The options are statehood, independence
or continued commonwealth status with more autonomy for its 3.2
million people. In a 1967 plebiscite, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean
island chose commonwealth status.

   A Texas congressman asked the Treasury
Department Friday to investigate a Customs Service ruling he says
would allow U.S. companies to import South African steel for
construction of a bridge across the Houston Ship Channel.
   Bryant, a Democrat, said the decision by Customs' Commercial
Rulings Division appears to go against the Anti-Apartheid Act of
1986, which prohibits the importation of South African steel and
iron into the United States.
   According to Bryant, the ruling would allow two contractors hired
by the Texas Highway Department, Williams Brothers of Houton and
Traylor Brothers of Indiana, to import nearly 3.1 million pounds of
steel from a South African company for the bridge project.
   Customs spokeswoman Judy Turner in Houston said the agency was
not prepared to comment late Friday on Bryant's inquiries. She said
she could not confirm the substance of the ruling and officials at
the division were not available for comment late Friday.
   The $91 million bridge would be the costliest state funded road
work in Texas history.
   According to Bryant, the ruling was issued July 14.
   ``Considering the fact that President Bush, the Congress, and
many other public officials both statewide and nationally have have
gone on record opposing the inhumane system of apartheid and the
purchase of materials derived from the exploitive use of cheap
leabor, I cannot even begin to comprehend this decision,'' said
Bryant.
   Bryant has also asked Robert H. Dedman, chairman of the Texas
Highways and Public Transportation Commission, for an explanation.
   ``I am at a loss to understand why the Highway Commission would
apparently not only pass over the American steel industry and its
workers, but also indirectly support South Africa's apartheid
government,'' Bryant wrote Dedman.
   Bryant has asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to determine
whether the Commercial Rulings Division has the jurisdiction to make
such a ruling, and on what basis it made its decision. He also wants
to known when the contract was signed, the name of the South African
company, and whether the ruling violates the Anti-Apartheid Act of
1986 or any other laws on trade with South Africa.
   The Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 is aimed at curtailing U.S. trade
with South Africa because of that country's system of racial
separation.

   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said
Friday that it found no examples of self-dealing by officials of the
Chicago Board of Trade during last month's forced liquidation of
soybean futures contracts.
   But the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee said a
preliminary report by the commission raised possible
conflict-of-interest questions about several of the officials who
voted to require traders to reduce their holdings of contracts
calling for future delivery of soybeans to them _ ``long'' positions.
   ``The CFTC must question those Chicago Board of Trade directors
participating in the July soybean decision whose affiliated firms
held net short positions in the July soybean contract in house or
customer accounts,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., in a statement
issued by his office.
   ``Credibility is paramount for exchanges in carrying out their
self-regulatory functions. The public will not tolerate self-dealing
or conflict of interest by exchange directors or insiders,'' the
Leahy statement said.
   Holders of ``short'' positions, promises to deliver beans they do
not own, would benefit from an order like the one issued by the
Board of Trade on July 11.
   One who holds a short position can can buy and deliver beans, or
he can buy an offsetting ``long'' position. Generally such a trader
is betting on a fall in price and the ability to buy an offsetting
contract at a price lower than he paid for his original contract,
thus making a profit.
   If the ``longs'' are forced to sell, the price of the contract
declines and the ``shorts'' can fulfill their obligations cheaper
than they would otherwise.
   The order forcing ``longs'' to sell touched off wild swings in
soybean prices and sparked sharp criticism by farm groups and
traders who saw the value of their holdings drop.
   The Board of Trade has said it acted after consulting the
commission because Italian grain merchant Ferruzzi Finanziaria
S.p.A., failed to reduce its large holdings in the July soybean
market voluntarily.
   Officials of the exchange have said they were worried that there
were not enough beans to fulfill all delivery commitments in the
final days of the contract.
   The order required traders to reduce their long positions to 1
million bushels and was widely perceived as a move to prevent
Ferruzzi from cornering the market _ that is, forcing other traders
into a position of having to deliver beans to Ferruzzi where
Ferruzzi was the only source of beans.
   Such a situation, if Ferruzzi could maintain it, would all but
enable Ferruzzi to name its own price to let the other traders off
the hook. Stock and commodity exchanges have rules aimed at banning
``corners.''
   Ferruzzi has denied any wrongdoing or intention to corner the
market and has bitterly critized the board's action.
   ``We continue to believe that is was totally unnecessary for the
board to take its emergency action,'' said David Swanson, an
executive with Ferruzzi Group, a U.S. subsidiary.
   ``The Ferruzzi Group supports Sen. Leahy's call for further
investigartion by the CFTC into the matter.''
   Michael Oakes, a spokesman for the exchange, said that even
though directors may have represented firms whose customers held
short July soybean positions ``they're not involved in the
decision-making of their customers.''
   The commission said it found no director who appeared to trade
for the purpose of profiting personally, or through an affiliated
firm, from prior knowledge of the July 11 order.
   One director excused himself before deliberations began because
he held a spread position _ both long and short _ in July soybeans.
His affiliated firm also had net short positions for itself and
customers.
   The commission's preliminary report was contained in a 36-page
letter to Leahy from Chairwoman Wendy L. Gramm. It said
investigators intend to conduct more interviews.

<TEXT>
   Philippe Petit hopes his high-wire walk to the
Eiffel Tower on Saturday will lift the hearts of the thousands
watching, inspire them to try the impossible and demonstrate real
freedom as France celebrates justice and liberty.
   Petit, known for his illicit and joyous walks between the towers
of Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral and New York's World Trade Center,
said Friday he is ready for the walk that will take him 2,300 feet
from the Palais de Chaillot to the Eiffel Tower's second level.
   ``I'm impatient to begin, to do something I've dreamt of doing my
whole life,'' said Petit, who was born 40 years ago in a suburb west
of Paris and now lives in New York.
   Rushing between the barber and a technical check of the rigging,
the aerialist took a moment to reflect on the spectacle that is a
highlight of French celebrations commemorating the bicentennial of
the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
   ``People hear the word funambulist and they think of the circus,
but that's not at all what I do,'' he said, gazing at the wire
strung fine as a spider's web.
   ``I want people to be enlightened by a vision, I want to uplift
their minds and hearts.''
   Petit, who shares with dancers a passion for poetic gestures and
movements that transfigure, is asked with deadly monotony about the
danger involved in his work. The question bores him.
   ``I take no risks. I've been preparing for this for 10 years and
the technical aspects for six months,'' said Petit, who did all his
own rigging and studied blueprints, photos and charts.
   His walk was authorized by Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac who will be
waiting on the tower's second level, 330 feet above the ground.
Petit will carry a rolled copy of the Declaration of the Rights of
Man on his 40-pound balancing bar to lay in Chirac's hands.
   The document, distilling ideals of liberty and social justice
that emerged in 1789 from the French Revolution, doesn't interest
Petit. He wants to present his own vision.
   ``When you see someone who does something seemingly impossible,
it must be that anything is possible. I want to tell people, 'Your
dreams can come true. Not by luck but by shovel and ax.'

<HEAD>Taiwan, U.S. Agree To Fishing Pact In North Pacific</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Taiwan have signed an
agreement that will enable federal authorities to track Taiwanese
fishing vessels by satellite in an effort to reduce illegal salmon
fishing in the North Pacific.
   The agreement, signed Thursday, calls for radio transponders to
be installed in Taiwanese boats, allowing satellite surveillance of
Taiwan's Pacific fishing fleet. It also permits U.S. officials to
board those ships.
   In addition, the pact provides for observers to monitor the
driftnet fishermen's impact on dolphin, porpoise, seal and other
marine mammal populations.
   ``Tough negotiating pays off,'' said U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska. ``I believe signing this agreement lays the cornerstone
for an overall effort to secure our fisheries and protect a most
vital resource.''
   The United States has accused Taiwan fishermen of using driftnets
to deplete the North Pacific of its rich marine resources,
especially the anadromous species of salmon that spawn in the United
States.
   Conservationists have criticized the driftnets, some of which are
40 miles long, for their ``incidental'' catches of thousands of sea
birds, seals and other animals.
   Some Northwest fishermen said they liked what they heard Friday
about the pact.
   ``It's another step forward,'' said Barry Collier of the Pacific
Seafood Processors Association.
   But at least one environmental group warned the agreement doesn't
go far enough and that no such pact has been signed with South Korea
as a congressionally mandated deadline approaches.
   ``You just can't trust these driftnetters,'' said Alan Reichman,
Pacific Ocean ecology coordinator for Greenpeace.
   Collier, whose Pacific Seafood Processors represents 85 percent
of the processors in Alaska, Washington and Oregon, estimated 7
million salmon were taken illegally during 1987.
   The agreement was signed for the United States by David Laux,
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, and Ding Mou-shih,
Taiwan's representative in Washington, D.C. Diplomatic letters to
finalize the agreement were signed Friday.
   The institute serves as the unofficial U.S. embassy in Taiwan.
The U.S. government severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1978.
   ``The key here is this monitoring equipment will go a long way to
determining where those fish are caught and give us more confidence
in managing the resource,'' said Vince Curry of the Alaska Factory
Trawlers Association.
   By signing the pact, Taiwan beat a Monday deadline set by a 1987
law that threatened sanctions if Japan, South Korea and Taiwan did
not agree to monitor their Pacific fishing fleets and enforce bans
on taking high-seas salmon.
   Japan signed an agreement in June that called for the
experimental use of transponders and a cadre of 47 observers _ nine
American, five Canadian and 33 Japanese _ to monitor driftnet damage
to marine mammal populations.
   Similar details were not available Friday for the pact with
Taiwan.
   The U.S. State Department said Friday that talks with the South
Koreans had been suspended until Aug. 29. Similar agreements to
those accepted by the Japanese and Taiwanese have been proposed.
   Yu Yu-hsien, chairman of Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, said in
Taipei that his government agreed to the pact for the sake of
600,000 fishermen on the island who depend on exports to the United
States, mostly of tuna and shrimp.

   Police believe the killing of Black
Panther co-founder Huey P. Newton was an attempt by an admitted drug
dealer to make a name for himself in a notorious prison-based gang.
   Tyrone Robinson, 25, told investigators Friday he fatally shot
Newton in self-defense after the one-time activist brandished a gun
in a desperate act to obtain crack, Police Sgt. Dan Mercado said.
   Other witnesses told police Newton was unarmed, Mercado said.
   Robinson, on parole for robbery, was arrested Tuesday on a
weapons charge 14 hours after Newton's death and about a block from
the scene of the killing. He admitted to the killing Friday morning,
while still in custody, was charged with investigation of murder and
faces arraignment Tuesday, Mercado said.

   Voyager 2 headed toward interstellar
space, leaving behind stunning photos of Neptune's moon Triton,
where pink snow falls on towering ice volcanoes unlike anything else
in the solar system.
   ``The range of geological forms is dazzling,'' astronomer-author
Carl Sagan said Friday. ``We are almost certainly in a regime of
volcanism involving ices, maybe exotic ices'' such as water ice
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane (natural gas).
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion-mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m. PDT Friday.
   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons
besides Nereid and Triton, which were first observed from Earth. It
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a
partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe also will prove to be
a complete ring.

   ``It will take us quite a while to just get the study going,''
Mary Ann Leeper of the Jackson, Wis., company said after the

   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank says his political
career is intact but he made a big mistake in hiring a paroled male
prostitute to do personal chores at his Washington home.
   Frank, who disclosed his homosexuality in May 1987, befriended

Massachusetts Democrat fired his employee in August 1987 when he
suspected the man was selling sex from Frank's apartment.
   ``Certainly if I were a voter, I would not ask my advice on how
to rehabilitate someone,'' Frank, 49, said during a news conference
Friday at his office in this Boston suburb. ``I think I have had
much better judgment in my public life.''
   The state Republican Party called on Frank to resign, but the
congressman, up for re-election in 1990, said the incident would not
affect his political career.

   A newly restored version of Sergei Eisenstein's
1938 film classic, ``Alexander Nevsky,'' is wowing audiences on a

   ``I'd love to take this film home to Russia,'' said producer John
Goberman, who said he is awaiting an overture from Moscow. ``The
first performance would knock them out. They'd be beside
themselves.''
   Besides Eisenstein's dramatic black-and-white photography, the
screen epic about the 13th century defeat of marauding Teutonic
armies by Russian forces led by Prince Nevsky features a rousing
musical score by composer Sergei Prokofiev.
   At Goberman's ``concert presentation'' tonight at the outdoor
theater of Wolf Trap Farm Park in suburban Virginia, the audience
will see a fresh print of Eisenstein's 107-minute movie, made from
the original nitrate negative in the Moscow film archive.

<HEAD>Treasury Bond Investors Disappointed As Interest Rates Stay Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some bond market investors had been pinning hopes
on lower interest rates, but recent indications that the economy is
maintaining strength have dashed speculation that the Federal
Reserve Board will ease rates soon.
   With that prospect now unlikely, bond prices have fallen in
recent weeks. The price drop has brought a return of an inverted
yield curve, or the situation where short-term bonds yield more than
longer-term ones.
   An inverted yield curve defies the logic that long-term investors
should be compensated more than short-term ones because of the
higher risk in holding debt for a longer period of time.
   A further weakening of bond prices has been caused by the
Treasury, which has flooded the government bond market with new debt
issues this month.
   Signs that a recession was not imminent prompted a bond selloff
earlier this month, putting even more downward pressure on prices.
Bonds are considered a good investment when the economy is slumping
because their rate of return is constant.
   But to confuse matters, bond prices rallied briefly this past
week. When bond prices rise, yields fall. Market watchers attributed
the price rise to an auction of five-year Treasury issues Wednesday
that drew greater-than-expected demand.
   However, trading was thin Wednesday, leading some to speculate
that the rally reflected buying interest among a small group of
investors.
   Market-watchers looking to the Fed's Federal Open Market
Committee for lower interest rates may be disappointed.
   The FOMC, which sets interest-rate policy, held its
eight-times-a-year meeting last week, but, as is its practice, gave
no hint of any decision on its strategy.
   Most experts expect the Fed to stay on its current course of
moderating economic growth by holding interest rates steady. The
Bush administration has been pressing for lower rates to stimulate
economic growth, but the Fed appears more concerned with
forestalling any resurgence in inflation.
   ``A few weeks ago everyone assumed that the economy was slowing
precipitously,'' said William Veronda, senior vice president for
fixed-income securities at the Denver investment firm Financial
Programs Inc.
   ``Unfortunately for that thesis it now appears that the economy
was either, one, never as bad as it appeared to be or two, there's
been some slight reacceleration,'' he said.
   The current bond slump curtailed a rally that sent Treasury
prices to two-year highs. The yield on the bellwether 30-year
Treasury bond fell from about 9.30 percent in late March to 7.84
percent on Aug. 1. Since then, it has risen somewhat, and was
trading in the range of 8 percent to 8.25 percent last week.
   Some market experts say that current economic conditions mean
neither gloom nor doom for bond investors.
   ``While recession may not be imminent, a rebound in economic
activity that could revitalize inflation appears remote,'' Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said in a commentary last week. ``Most of the
market's recent setback reflects how too many investors had expected
too quick an easing of monetary policy.''
   Some market-watchers advise bond investors to put their money in
the middle range of debt maturities, such as five-year Treasury
notes, striking a balance between the attraction of high yields on
short-term instruments and the possibility of capital gains on
long-term bonds.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., has advised customers to reduce
their long-term bond holdings as a percentage of their total
investments due to the belief that the Fed will not ease interest
rates soon.
   Smith Barney and other investment houses believe that long-term
Treasuries will hold in the range of 8 percent to 8.50 percent in
coming months. But, says Smith Barney, it now seems more likely that
these bonds would yield more than this range rather than less in the
near term.
   ``We continue to see the potential for still lower yields over
the intermediate to longer term on the assumption that the Federal
Reserve continues a policy of, on balance, restraint as long as the
economy is operating near full resource utilization,'' the
investment house said in a commentary.

<HEAD>Sugar Prices Swing Between Sweet and Sour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices fluctuated widely on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as traders bought into the market on news of
a large purchase by India and bailed out on reports the European
sugar beet crop may exceed last year's.
   Adding to sugar price instabilty is what analysts say is the
inability of the October futures contract to sustain advances at a
price higher than 14 cents a pound.
   Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York,
said traders view the sugar market as bullish, but are afraid to buy
contracts.
   He said there won't be a significant change in trader attitudes
until Third World countries are willing to pay high prices created
by the delicate balance of supply and demand.
   World sugar stocks are low due to several years of poor
sugar-cane crops and steadily rising consumption.
   Savaiko said a factor keeping Third World countries out of the
sugar market is that sugar is often bought and sold for dollars,
making it expensive in terms of those country's currencies.
   A Third World leader, India, entered the market for 200,000 tons
of refined sugar. But it had been expected that India would purchase
as much as 500,000 tons of raw and refined sugar, so the smaller
figure was a disappointment.
   Sugar prices fell sharply on projections by F.O. Licht, the West
German sugar statistical firm, that European sugar production will
increase from the 30.1 million tons produced last year to 32.3
million tons.
   Licht also said weather in the Soviet Union had been excellent,
resulting in an improved crop of sugar in that country, reducing its
import needs.

<HEAD>Malcolm Forbes and George M. Cohan Have Things in Common</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malcolm Forbes might measure up to George M.
Cohan as a showman, but the multimillionaire motorcyclist doesn't
hold a candle to the vaudevillian hoofer when it comes to outdancing
the Internal Revenue Service.
   Forbes dropped some vague hints that he might seek a tax
deduction for his belly-dancing ``party of the century'' last
weekend in Morocco, where such swells as Henry Kissinger and
Elizabeth Taylor ate pigeon under tents.
   After a small public outcry, Forbes called a news conference to
say he would not be taking a deduction for his 70th birthday party
and in fact had never considered doing so.
   Clearly business entertainment is not what it was 59 years ago,
when the late George M. Cohan scored a victory over the IRS so
sweeping that tax lawyers still talk about ``the Cohan rule.''
   Cohan, the original Yankee Doodle Boy, claimed $55,000 in
deductions for entertaining his actors, employees, drama critics and
lawyer in the early 1920s. The IRS disallowed the deductions because
he hadn't kept records.
   In 1930, a federal appeals court ruled that since Cohan obviously
had some legitimate expenses, the IRS appeals board should find a
way to grant him some deductions in spite of the lack of records.
   The Cohan rule hamstrung the IRS over the following decades, and
``people who knew how to milk the system probably got more than they
should have,'' said Nancy Anderson, senior tax research and training
specialist for H&amp;R Block Inc. in Kansas City, Mo.
   In the 1980s, Congress has tightened the tax laws on business
entertainment considerably, not only toughening record-keeping
standards to eliminate the Cohan rule but cutting the deduction rate
to 80 percent and gradually limiting or disallowing deductions that
once were routine: golf club dues, nights out at cheesy discos, sky
boxes at the Superdome.
   Malcolm Forbes argued this past week that he could have qualified
for some deductions if he had wanted to, since many of his guests
were advertisers in his magazine, but several tax experts said the
magazine publisher was living in the past.
   ``I don't know where Forbes was coming from,'' said Mario Borino,
national tax director for the accounting firm of BDO Seidman. ``Even
under the old law, before tax reform, I would have serious questions
as to whether the cost of any part of that birthday was deductible.''
   ``It used to be kind of fair game, you go to a sporting event or
you go out to a nightclub-type restaurant and have a great time, and
just because you happen to do business with the people, you deduct
it. That just doesn't fly anymore,'' said H&amp;R Block's Ms. Anderson.
   Forbes is not the only victim of changing times: A Philadelphia
rabbi, Arnold H. Feldman, was turned down by the Tax Court in 1986
when he tried to deduct the $4,000 cost of his son's bar mitzvah
reception for 725 people.
   Under Section 274 of the tax code, the taxpayer must establish
that ``the item was directly related to or ... associated with the
active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.''
   For Forbes, discussing hot-air balloons with Lee Iacocca thus
would not qualify. Moreover, there is no deduction for ``amounts
which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances,'' which
would seem to disqualify a party featuring 600 belly dancers and a
thundering horde of 200 Berber marksmen on horseback.
   ``It's a very good example of what used to be, and would be a
real hard sell now,'' Ms. Anderson said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks set a record on
Thursday, one day short of the second anniversary of its previous
peak. The 56.53-point surge to 2,734.64 was hailed by some analysts
as closing the book on the stock market crash of 1987. But on
Friday, stocks retreated slightly and the Dow average fell 2.28
points.
   _Holiday Corp., once known as ``America's Innkeeper,'' agreed to
sell its Holiday Inn division to Britain's brewing giant Bass PLC,
which will pay $125 million in stock and assume about $2.1 billion
of Holiday debt. The deal marked the end of an era for the nation's
first motel franchise, founded 35 years ago by entrepreneur Kemmons
Wilson.
   _Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo suggested he might sell a
controlling stake in Continental Airlines, partly because the
carrier's business has been hurt by a bitter strike at sister
carrier Eastern.

   As they study the forces behind the advance that
carried the stock market to record highs in the past week, some
analysts look far beyond the latest swing in interest rates or the
economic outlook for 1990.
   The impressive gains in stock prices this year, they say, have
merely extended a historic bull market that can be traced back to
1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average stood as low as 776.92,
or even 1974, when it bottomed at 577.60.
   As the charts of this long climb keep stretching out, they make
the crash of 1987 look less and less like the cataclysmic event it
seemed at the time, for all the pain it inflicted.
   The first would-be historians of the great bull market see
several large-scale themes running through it:
   _A return to free-market economic policies in the world's
industrialized countries after the increased reliance on government
control and regulation that had taken place in the years since World
War II.
   _A sense of capitalism on the offensive, and communism on the
defensive, around the world, with economic power gaining importance
over military might.
   _A largely successful campaign to subdue inflation in the United
States after a scary surge in prices in the 1970s that had eroded
confidence in financial rather than tangible assets.
   _The ``restructuring'' of American industry, under pressure from
foreign competition, to make it fit once again to hold its own in
global markets.
   Broad generalizations of this kind make many investors squirm.
Any time people start believing grandiose claims about the supposed
significance of what the market is doing, veterans of the game start
to suspect that stocks are ripe for a fall.
   Still, ideas like this suggest that the stock market has been
doing a lot more in the 1980s than just bouncing around wildly at
the whims of computer-program traders or the latest monthly economic
statistic.
   Furthermore, they represent the kind of long-term thinking that
separates true ``investors'' from traders bucking the house odds to
try to profit from a hot tip or takeover rumor.
   At the close on Friday, Dow Jones's average of 30 industrials
stood at 2,732.36, up 44.39 from the week before.
   Among the broader indexes that had preceded the Dow to new highs
several weeks earlier, the New York Stock Exchange composite index
rose 2.15 to 194.79; the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market gained 4.78 to 466.75, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index was up 2.00 at 381.18.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 165.96 million shares a day, up
from 148.84 million the week before.
   The back-to-nature economics movement underlying the bull market
hasn't always been a pretty or popular phenomenon.
   It has been accompanied by financial scandals in both the United
States and Japan; upheavals in the once-stable working environments
of countless employers, and a long-running debate over whether the
energy born of rampant self-interest will take any society where it
wants to go.
   Many observers worry that it has spawned excesses _ most notably
in the use of borrowed money at every level of the economy _ that
could sooner or later turn the market's heyday into a wistful memory.
   But for now at least, it has validated the faith of true
believers in the long-term merits of stock ownership, 1987 crash or
not.
   As Norman Fosback put the case in the investment advisory letter
Market Logic, ``Those who forswear the stock market forever because
of (the crash) overlook the real lesson of history: A long-term
stock investment program is the most reliable, and easiest, way to
accumulate wealth that our society has to offer.''

   Though some first-time investors who were scared
away by the stock market crash two years ago never returned, those
who remained got their reward, market watchers said.
   The record high of 2,734.64 in the Dow Jones industrials average
Thursday once again pointed out the value of a long-term investment
strategy, these observers said.
   On Friday, the average slipped back 2.28 points to 2,732.36.
   Anyone who held stocks for the past two years has about broken
even, while people who panicked and sold at the bottom took big
losses.
   ``A person has to live through a market break to fully appreciate
what can happen in the next market peak,'' said Ken Janke, president
of the National Association of Investors Corp., a non-profit group
of individual investors and investment-club members.
   Media accounts of small investors abandoning the stock market
after the crash were overblown, says James Cloonan, president of the
American Association of Individual Investors.
   The shrinkage in his members' stock portfolios was mainly from a
drop in the market price of shares, not stock sales, he said.
   Industry figures show that individual investors did leave the
market after the crash, but that many have since returned.
   According to the Securities Industry Association, an average of
37 million shares a day were traded by retail, as opposed to
institutional, customers on the New York Stock Exchange in August
1987.
   That November, after the crash, the average number of daily
retail trades dropped to 31 million. The average for all of 1988 was
29 million retail trades a day.
   But the figure jumped to 39 million a day from January to June of
this year, the latest figures available.
   ``The retail investor definitely is back,'' said George Monahan,
director of industry studies for the industry group.
   Nevertheless, Don Scidmore, a small investor in Seattle, said he
believes the Dow high could scare some investors away from the
market rather than lure new ones.
   ``The little investors, you can to go any (investment) club now
and they're chewing their fingers and saying the Dow's up now and
it's due for a fall,'' said Scidmore, who is retired and belongs to
two investment clubs.
   Scidmore is not frightened away himself. ``If you're in it for
the long run, so what?'' he said. ``It goes up and it goes down.''
   Individual investors feel unable to compete with market
professionals and institutions, said David McLaughlin, a portfolio
manager with Chase Investment Counsel Corp., an independent
financial consultant in Charlottesville, Va.
   ``The individual investor feels that he's sort of outside looking
in, that the experts know what's going on, they know where to look
for takeover candidates,'' McLaughlin said. ``The individual feels
that he doesn't get a fair shake.''
   McLaughlin believes the Dow high will do little to lure more
small investors back to the market. He said the reaction of many is,
``Well, I missed it and I should have been in on it but it's too
late now.''
   ``I think if we had a recession and we got into it for couple of
quarters, and of course the stock market would probably be lower,
then I think you'd see the individual investor coming back,'' he
said.
   On the flip side of that coin, McLaughlin said that if the Dow
continues its upward climb and sets more records, the trauma of the
crash could fade into the back of many investors' minds.
   Nancy Dunnan, an author of investment books, agreed that many
individual investors have returned to the market. But, she said,
``'87 wasn't that long ago, so you're not going to see all of them
jump back in.''
   She said small investors should have learned at least one lesson
from the crash.
   ``I think they should watch the market every single day and not
let it ride, and if they see a dip and they've already made their
profit to not be shy or greedy and take that profit,'' she said.

   The Japanese did it in six months. France did it
in 19 months, and Britain beat us by 20 days.
   While the new record set by the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials was celebrated as a symbolic comeback from the crash of
1987, other stock markets around the world have made faster
recoveries than Wall Street.
   ``It wasn't that the U.S. did poorly,'' Mark Sladkus, a vice
president at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said Friday. ``It's that the
other markets had special circumstances.''
   A market measure compiled by Morgan Stanley and based on overall
market performance shows that the U.S. market reached a new high on
July 26, lagging Japan, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, the
Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.
   On the continent, 1992 became a phenomenon that investors could
``sink their teeth into,'' and Europeans worked hard to sell
investors on the concept of a single market of 320 million
consumers, said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities
Co. International Inc.
   ``It refocused attention on ... the tremendous opportunities that
will be there in the private sector'' as trade barriers melt away
and Europe becomes an unencumbered free market, Brusca said.
   In advance of 1992, the mergers and acquisition fever that has
heated up the U.S. market for so long ``spread its virus to the
continent,'' Brusca said.
   Last year, Italian financier Carlo DeBenedetti almost
single-handedly hoisted the Belgian market out of the doldrums with
his hostile _ and ultimately unsuccessful _ bid for Societe
Generale, a huge Belgian conglomerate.
   In addition to outright mergers, European companies are fast
forming cross-border alliances with like-minded firms. All that is
bringing in ``new technology, new competitors and more strength and
vitality to markets that had been a little more parochial,'' Brusca
said.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 30-share index hit
a new high on Aug. 4 and has since surpassed that mark. The broader
100-share index is just 46 points shy of its all-time high.
   Japan, long the envy of other markets, posted a new high in April
1988, less than six months after Black Monday. But experts note the
Japanese market did not fall as hard in the crash and therefore had
less ground to regain than other markets.
   Additionally, extremely low yields in the Japanese bond market
gave stocks a boost. ``There are not a lot of competing domestic
instruments, so the stock market emerges as king,'' Brusca said.
   This year, however, its performance has been ho-hum. A scandal in
the top ranks of government has taken its toll, as has the weakening
of the yen against the dollar. Japanese investors flush with cash
are looking farther afield for places to stash their money.
   Hong Kong, which also performed well following the crash riding
the wave of enthusiasm over China's plans for economic expansion,
was ``slam-dunked'' following the Tiananmen Square massacre, said
Brusca. The key Hang Seng index, which hit a 1989 high of 3,309.6 in
mid-May, plunged to 2,093.6 on June 5. It has yet to near its
pre-crash high.
   Surprisingly, some of the best post-crash opportunities can be
found in emerging markets like Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, Argentina
and others, which allow foreigners to invest directly in securities.
So far this year, Morgan Stanley has pegged their collective growth
rate at about 33 percent.
   ``Over the long term, those markets will outperform others
because they represent more rapidly expanding economies,'' Morgan
Stanley's Sladkus said. They are clearly riskier but offer an option
to investors bent on diversification.
   Thanks to the recent strength of the dollar, the U.S. markets
remain attractive, compared to their foreign counterparts.
   ``There's clearly a pretty consistent flow into U.S.-dollar
assets, including stocks, largely because confidence in our currency
has been restored,'' said Charles I. Clough, chief investment
strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``A strong currency will just
continually pull in foreign investments.''
   Other economic factors add to the allure of American stocks and
bonds. ``There's a good feeling in terms of interest rates coming
down, corporate earnings going up, and that we've been able to avoid
a hard landing,'' said Sladkus.

Says</HEAD>

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said he
was considering a sale of Continental Airlines because the ``noise''
at strike-torn Eastern Airlines was hurting the sister carrier's
business.
   In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Lorenzo said
the sale of part or all of Houston-based Continental was under
discussion partly because of the negative impact from Eastern's
bitter strike and bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' Lorenzo said
in his New York office. ``We have an obligation to look for
alternatives ... (Continental) has been impacted by the noise level
from all of our friends over in Miami.''
   He made the surprise announcement about Continental late Thursday
in response to a question at a company meeting.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since March 9, five days after pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing
as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers.
   The spillover from the Eastern situation has eroded bookings on
Continental flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter,
said Lorenzo, whose Texas Air is the parent of the two carriers.
Continental showed a net profit of $32.1 million in the quarter,
compared with a loss of $150.9 million a year earlier.
   Continental could benefit from ``distance'' from Eastern, Lorenzo
said. He cited the success of the Trump Shuttle, which enjoyed a
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer Donald Trump
bought it from Eastern in early June for $365 million.
   Lorenzo stressed, however, a full or partial sale of Continental
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision
hasn't yet been made.
   ``We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible
sale, he said.
   Despite the strife at Eastern and Continental's reputation as a
fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, Texas Air stock has
soared from around $9 or $10 a share at the beginning of the year to
over $20 currently. It rose 87{ cents Friday to close at $20.75 on
the American Stock Exchange, after jumping as high as $22.25.
   Possible buyers of Continental or part of it could include
Scandinavian Airlines System, which has a 10 percent interest in
Texas Air, and Pan Am Corp., which has expressed a desire to merge
with another airline. Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are allowed
to buy up to 25 percent of American carriers. There also has been
speculation that Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc., may be interested in a combination with Continental.
   Lorenzo, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger
with another airline, according to a source close to the company who
asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an
investor group, possibly including SAS or another foreign carrier.
   SAS spokeswoman Barbara Levites and Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon, both in New York, declined comment on the matter Friday. An
Icahn associate didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
   Continental would carry a sale price of about $2 billion if it
were sold in its entirety, and Lorenzo may be trying to find out
what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he (Lorenzo) would be
considering a major sale,'' said Daniel Hersh, an analyst with
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.
   Lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy
sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling
Continental a hot property.
   A group led by California investor Alfred Checchi recently
acquired Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $4 billion, while
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. is being ardently pursued by
investor Marvin Davis, British Airways PLC and others.

   Like kids tussling over an Easter basket of
goodies, two federal agencies and the financial exchanges they
regulate are squaring off over a new money-making product for
investors known as a ``stock basket.''
   On one side are the stock exchanges and their overseer, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, created in the depths of the
Depression to regulate stocks and bonds and protect the people who
invest in them.
   On the other side is the newer Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and its charges, the boisterous markets that deal in
commodities such as soybeans, pork bellies and silver.
   The product at issue is technically called an ``index
participation,'' but it resembles a basket of stocks because it
allows investors to buy or sell something with a value tied to broad
stock market indexes, such as the Standard &amp; Poors 500. That's why
it's also called a stock basket.
   A week ago, a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled the SEC
overstepped itself in authorizing three exchanges, in New York,
Philadelphia and Chicago, to trade stock baskets.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the new financial
instruments are futures contracts and should be regulated by the
CFTC _ throwing doubt on the legitimacy of the baskets traded on the
stock exchanges.
   ``It's like being married for five years and finding out the
preacher wasn't licensed,'' says AMEX President Kenneth R. Leibler,
``and if you want to get married again, you have to do it in a
different state.''
   While the new products haven't been a raging success since
trading began May 12 in New York and Philadelphia, some observers
they represent the future of the securities industry.
   New product development became particularly important after the
1987 stock crash, which depressed the business of many investment
firms and forced them to seek ways of luring investors back.
   The American and Philadelphia exchanges, as well as the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, thought one answer would be stock baskets.
   Unlike stocks, investors never actually buy the securities that
make up a stock index and therefore have no ownership rights. But
unlike commodity futures, there's no settlement or termination date.
The basket can be held indefinitely.
   For example, an investor could buy a basket tied to the S&amp;P 500
index when it has a value of 300. A monetary value is assigned to
each contract, usually sold in lots of 100. If the value was $30 (or
one-tenth the S&amp;P 500 index), the basket would be worth $3,000 and
if the index went up 10 points, the investor would make a profit of
$100 because the lot of 100 was now worth $3,100.
   But the stock baskets also represent a challenge to similar
products offered by the two major futures exchanges in Chicago: the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Those two exchanges claimed the stock baskets ought to be
regulated by the CFTC and the appeals court agreed, saying the law
creating the CFTC clearly gave it authority in this case.
   ``Our feeling is the CFTC is best equipped to regulate futures
products because it has the expertise,'' said Michael O'Connell, a
spokesman for the Board of Trade.
   To U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, chairman of the House finance
subcommittee, who has tried unsuccessfully to push market reform
legislation, the ruling ``highlights the problems inherent in this
turf battle between the SEC and the CFTC,'' said a Markey spokesman.
   But Joanne Medero, the CFTC's general counsel, said: ``I don't
think the people here feel it is a turf battle _ not on the
commissioner or staff level. The turf battle may be more between the
securities exchanges and the commodities exchanges, rather than the
agencies, which is fine. That's competition.''
   The CFTC did file court papers in the Chicago lawsuit stating its
view that stock baskets are futures contracts, and if the ruling is
appealed Ms. Medero said ``we would reiterate our position.''
   Spokesmen for both stock and futures exchanges stopped short of
saying another agency might not treat them fairly but indicated they
preferred to deal with the one they've known for years.
   Stock exchange officials noted that margins _ the amount of money
or collateral that must be put up to buy securities _ are less
stringent in the futures markets.
   Under CFTC rules, said Nicholas Giordano, president of the
Philadelphia exchange, the stock basket ``won't be a product that
appeals to the public investor _ the man in the street. It'll be
more speculative, have higher risk and would not enjoy the
protection of public investor rules that have been cultivated by the
SEC for 50 years.''
   The SEC has yet to announce whether it will appeal the ruling by
the Chicago federal court.
   ``I really can't tell you until we do it,'' said Paul Gonson, the
SEC's solicitor, although he confirmed that the agency was
discussing alternatives with the exchanges.
