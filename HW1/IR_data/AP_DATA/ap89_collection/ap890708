<HEAD>Bird Deaths from Tanker Spill Continue to Rise</HEAD>

   Oil contamination from the Exxon Valdez
spill has killed about 27,000 sea birds and the death toll can be
expected to increase for at least a few more months, the U.S. Fish &amp;
Wildlife Service said.
   ``We just don't know how long it's going to go on,'' said Vivian
Mendenhall, marine bird coordinator at the agency's Anchorage office.
   She said the numbers of dead birds being found has dropped off
since the initial fatalities after the tanker struck a reef in
Prince William Sound on March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons
of crude oil spilled into the sea.
   In general, seabirds over water cannot detect oil and do not
discriminate between clean places and dirty places in deciding where
to touch down, Mendenhall said.
   Figures released Friday by a federal information office in Valdez
show 563 of 1,326 seabirds received alive at rescue centers have
been released. Nearly 600 have died at the facilities.
   Fish &amp; Wildlife Service spokesman Bruce Batten said 103 bald
eagles are known to have died from the spill. Alaska's bald eagle
population is about 35,000, with 3,000 of the birds in Prince
William Sound and 5,000 in other areas contaminated with oil, he
said.
   The federal tally sheet released Friday also reported 843 otters
dead. About two-thirds of the 343 received alive by rescue centers
have survived. Batten said a Fish &amp; Wildlife Service plan for the
release of treated otters likely will be issued next week.

   Ballet goers who weren't pleased that the Kirov
Ballet opened its U.S. tour here Monday with the unfamiliar ``Le
Corsaire'' could rejoice Friday night when the well-known
``Giselle'' was danced like a beautiful poem.
   Farukh Ruzimatov, thus far the most impressive dancer in this
high-caliber company, danced Count Albrecht. It is thrilling to see
an artist so secure in his technique that he never has to press but
lets his art flow, with time to present subtleties.
   Ruzimatov looked noble in features and bearing but so did Gennadi
Babanin as the woodsman Hilarion, so it was plausible that Giselle
would accept the count as rural and fall in love with him. Ruzimatov
made Count Albrecht really in love with Giselle. His partnering of
her was gentle and attentive. When his royal fiancee arrives, he
walks with her with ill grace instead of immediately ditching
Giselle for her, as some do when dancing the count.
   And Ruzimatov made some sudden, very exciting bursts into
dramatic dancing.
   Zhanna Ayupova danced Giselle. She was good but not riveting
early in Act 1. But she made her mad scene unusually poignant and
she was exquisite in Act 2, as the ghost of herself. The
Giselle-Albrecht duets were tenderly emotional. All the principal
dancers conveyed the emotions of the characters they danced.
   The corps de ballet dancing was shimmering, accurate but soft,
without the sharp edge that the word accurate can convey. This
production isn't afraid to have the orchestra playing in Act 2 with
nobody on stage, which strongly builds anticipation.
   There are moments from this exceptional ``Giselle'' to cherish
and remember.
   After the Kirov Ballet closes at the Metropolitan Opera July 22,
it will appear at Kennedy Center in Washington July 25 to Aug. 6,
the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco Aug. 9 to 16 and
Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, Calif., Aug. 18 to
27.

<HEAD>The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod Triennial Convention Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod triennial
convention began Friday in Wichita with a prayer and communion
service.
   About 1,100 voting delegates, half of them clergy and half lay
members, were expected at the 57th Regular Convention of the 2.6
million member St. Louis-based denomination.
   The election of church officers is scheduled Saturday. The
current president, the Rev. Ralph A. Bohlmann, 57, has led the
denomination since 1981 when he was part of a conservative movement
in the synod.
   Some conservatives in the church now contend Bohlmann has become
too moderate. They led an effort to unseat him at the 1986
convention, but narrowly failed.
   Other candidates for president during Saturday's elections
include the Rev. Eugene W. Bunkowske, 53, chairman of the Department
of Missions at Concordia Theological Seimary, Ft. Wayne, Ind.; the
Rev. Robert D. Preus, 64, president of Concordia Theological
Seminary, Fort Wayne, Ind.; the Rev. Robert C. Sauer, 67, St.
Charles Mo., a veteran pastor who is chairman of the synod's
Catechism Translation Task Force; and the Rev. George F, Wollenburg,
58, parish pastor of Christ The King in Billings, Mont. and second
vice president of the synod.
   During the course of the convention, delegates will consider 132
resolutions including two on social issues previously unaddressed by
the synod.
   A resolution on homelessness would encourage the synod's housing
task force to assist congregations with housing ministries and
monitor federal legislation affecting the homeless.
   A resolution on AIDS recalls Jesus' example of ``unconditional
love, care and compassion in the treatment of the afflicted'' and
urges congregations to commit themselves to minister to victims of
the disease.
   Other resolutions address evangelism, a possible synod name
change to reflect its international scope, a task force on black
ministry, urban ministry planning and outreach to Jewish people.
   The convention is scheduled to run through July 14.

   Anne Droid looks like a typical mannequin, except
for an unusual twinkle in one eye. That twinkle means Anne Droid can
``see'' you. She can also ``hear'' and even ``remember.''
   Anne Droid is a surveillance mannequin designed to watch for
shoplifters, an idea that has caught the eye of some retailers.
   ``My wife is a jeweler,'' says F. Jerry Gutierrez, Anne Droid's
creator. ``We were in a jewelry store and they had a TV monitor set
up, but I couldn't find the camera. Then the jeweler showed me this
tiny thing and I thought, `My God, that would fit in a mannequin.'''
   At the time, Gutierrez's job was to restore mannequins _ a
business he started when he was laid off as a carpenter.
   Now, the 40-year-old Gutierrez has designed a line of mannequins
with built-in cameras and microphones, which he hopes business
owners will use to fight shoplifting.
   Gutierrez inserts a miniature camera behind a mannequin eye, and
the image is projected on a monitor that can be viewed privately.
For sound, a microphone is placed in one nostril. Everything the
mannequin sees or hears can be recorded on videotape.
   ``It's got a perspective no other surveillance system has,'' said
Eric Freehling, who owns Odyssey Jewelry and Watch Out Watches in
Denver.
   He said when he first heard about Gutierrez's mannequins he was
interested only in getting one for his store.
   ``I thought it was a heck of an idea,'' Freehling says. ``Then I
realized he didn't have as much of a business background as he
needed to get off the ground. With my CPA background and a lot of
experience in retail I told him I'd see if I could help.''
   A partnership developed, as did a spinoff from the mannequin
restoration business called Anne Droid Security Systems. Freehling
pitched in $115,000 to help launch it.
   Basic security mannequins cost about $2,400, not including extras
like a time-lapse VCR, Gutierrez said.
   ``One gentleman travels a lot and he wants to have a male
mannequin that would `watch' television to give the appearance
someone is home,'' he said. ``If that wasn't a deterrent the
mannequin would double as security for him'' by recording anyone
entering the room.
   Gutierrez said he has an order for 10 mannequins from a major
Denver retailer but wouldn't give the company's name and did not say
how many he's sold altogether.
   ``This is covert surveillance,'' he explained. ``Some businesses
don't want the customers to know they are being watched.''
   Shoplifting and employee theft cost the nation $508 billion
annually, said Detective Gail Riddell, who heads the Denver police
shoplifting unit.
   ``I think it's an interesting idea,'' said Susan Henderson, owner
of Bikboks, a store in a tony Denver shopping district. She has
ordered a male Anne Droid for delivery in the fall and plans to use
it for nighttime surveillance.

   Buster was going to serve as ring
bearer, but now he's being treated like a dog and he's out of the
wedding.
   A 10-month-old Samoyed, the dog was scheduled to participate at
today's wedding of his masters, Tracy Galentine and Val Finnell, at
Christ Community Church in this Pittsburgh suburb.
   The Rev. Cho Kim approved of the plan until church officials at a
United Methodist Church conference in Grove City, 50 miles to the
north, read a June 14 news story about Buster and the wedding and
expressed their misgivings to the minister.
   Kim changed her mind and now the groom's mother is annoyed.
   ``After all, how long is the dog going to be in that church?''
said Dolores Finnell. ``During biblical times, sheep were allowed at
the altar and in temples. I can't understand now what is wrong with
a dog.''

   After five litters of puppies, a Doberman
pinscher named Saber was ready for a change. So she took to nursing
a litter of kittens whose mother wanted no part of them.
   ``She didn't have any puppies of her own, so she just decided she
wanted the kittens,'' Linda Ferguson said of her 8-year-old dog who
has been using the milk from a false pregnancy to nurse five
2{-week-old kittens.
   The kittens' mother decided she would rather hunt than tend to
her new breed, leaving them hungry and weak. Before long, Mrs.
Ferguson said, Saber began snooping around the kittens and ``acting
kind of goofy.''
   Before the Fergusons knew it, Saber stepped in and took over.
When Mrs. Ferguson tried to put the kittens in with their natural
mother, her husband Gordy said, Saber ``just went berserk.''
   The dog now refuses to go on morning walks because, Mrs. Ferguson
believes, she doesn't want to let the kittens out of her sight.
   ``She's a lot more protective of these kittens than she ever was
about her puppies,'' Mrs. Ferguson said. ``She won't leave 'em. She
just won't. I haven't seen anything like it before.''

<HEAD>Construction-Weary Residents Grab Plungers for SewerFest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OBERLIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents weary of wending their way through
sewer construction will grab plungers and kazoos for some
lighthearted fun at a SewerFest later this month.
   ``It started out as one of those hokey things,'' said Jan Pierce,
a coordinator of the event. ``I haven't laughed so much in ages
putting it together. We hope the community will have some fun with
it.''
   Since last year, barricaded streets have forced Oberlin motorists
to take inconvenient routes and the rough roads have rattled car
alignments. Construction is set for fall completion.
   Ms. Pierce said she had to buy three new tires because of the
rough going on streets along construction sites.
   ``We don't know from day to day how the streets will go,'' said
Ms. Pierce. ``It's frustrating. We all feel it on a personal level.''
   The two-day SewerFest, sponsored by the Oberlin Downtown
Merchants Association, features a parade July 21 with jackhammers, a
dump truck and the city sewer-cleaning machine, and a kazoo marching
band with people dressed in sewer-cleaning uniforms.
   Residents are invited to submit essays on their worst ``war
story'' because of the construction , with a $250 prize for the
winning entry. The essays will be bound and given to the library's
community history department.
   Oberlin Police Chief Robert Jones said officers who often got the
complaints for the blocked and torn-up streets can laugh it off
during the festival.
   ``Policemen are always at the brunt of all the complaints,''
Jones said. ``You get used to it and just smile. The humorous idea
of (SewerFest) was quite refreshing.''
   The festival, he said, will be a way to ``let out the
frustrations people have been going through.''

   Charter boat captain Frank Mundus, said to
be the inspiration for the shark fisherman in the movie ``Jaws,''
has for years wrestled fearlessly with the mightiest of the seas.
   But now the 63-year-old folk hero has a new challenge. After 45
years on the water, he forgot to renew his charter boat captain's
license and must pass a tough Coast Guard exam to get it back.
   ``It's bloody embarrassing,'' said Mundus, as he stood in front
of his boat, Cricket II, after an all-day outing Thursday.
   ``I'm scared to take that test,'' said Mundus, who has only a
ninth-grade education. ``It's all book work. But I'll just have to
knuckle down and study. The rules are the rules.''
   ``He doesn't have to study. He knows everything,'' said Coast
Guard spokesman James McGranachan, who added that the service told
Mundus they would help him by reading the questions to him.
   ``A lot of people fail the test but not people like him,''
McGranachan said. ``It's in his blood by now. ... Everything we have
heard about him is that he is a good captain.''
   Mundus said he forgot to renew his license when it expired in May
1988 and during the following one-year grace period because he was
working hard and was distracted by his upcoming wedding to a
28-year-old English woman.
   The legendary Mundus, who was wearing a gold pierced earring in
his left ear and a pearly white shark's tooth around his neck, still
takes groups out on his boat but must have a licensed charter
captain aboard with him.
   ``It's only a minor inconvenience,'' said the balding, lanky man.
   But he was quick to add, ``I'm still the boss here. I wouldn't
trust my captain's chair to anybody.''
   ``If it weren't for the people I take out, I wouldn't stay
alive,'' he said. ``I have more fun going out than they do.''
   Mundus, a native of Point Pleasant, N.J., has been a charter boat
captain in Montauk since 1951.
   Stories of Mundus' shark fishing adventures are said to have
inspired Peter Benchley to write the best-selling novel, ``Jaws.''
Benchley, according to Mundus, went on a few shark hunts with him in
the 1970s. The shark fisherman character was called Quint in the
movie.
   Mundus says his personality goes from carefree to serious when he
sees a shark he wants.
   ``If I see something over 1,000 pounds, I say to myself, `I'm
going to get that fish.' I don't care if we tear the boat apart to
get it.''
   In 1964, Mundus' boat harpooned a 4,500-pound white shark which
is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest shark
harpooned in this century. In 1986, his boat took in a 3,500-pound
shark which he said is the largest fish in the world to be caught by
a rod and reel.
   The head of that shark hangs in Mundus' house and it is one of
its teeth that hangs around Mundus' neck.
   But his years on the water are winding down.
   His 42-foot custom-built fishing boat is up for sale at $150,000
and he said if he sells it next summer it will probably be his last
season running the charter.
   He plans to retire to Hawaii with his wife, Jenny. The couple met
after she wrote him from her home in Cornwall, England, of her
interest in sharks. They corresponded for several months before
Mundus invited her to the United States last November.
   Mundus said he is building his Hawaiian retirement home ``in the
hills amidst the fruit trees.''
   But he knows he will always think about his days on the water.
``When it's time to go, I'll just give a sigh of relief and walk
away thinking we caught all the largest fish.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to link a pay raise
for top government officials with a requirement they be evaluated
every three years is being criticized by the chairman of a House
civil service subcommittee.
   Rep. Gary L. Ackerman, D-N.Y., chairman of a panel that oversees
federal pay, claims the plan would inject even more partisanship
into the federal personnel structure than exists already.
   ``It creates a system in which there will be a political litmus
test. People will have to snooker up to their supervisors and kiss
their rings to keep their pay raises,'' Ackerman said. ``That's not
what government service is all about.''
   The Bush proposal would raise salaries for senior government
executives by 8 to 25 percent. The evaluation every three years
would certify they deserve the higher salary.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater claims the
certification would ``assure that these people perform at a level
that justifies the higher salary. We do not believe it would weaken
their rights.''
   The package Bush sent to Congress Friday would give pay raises to
some 7,900 federal officials _ including 700 political appointees
and another 7,200 career executives. These include top Foreign
Service employes and three- and four-star generals and admirals.
   The most-senior officials, including the political appointees,
agency heads and other high-ranking officers, would receive the full
25 percent. Lesser-ranking executives would receive smaller boosts,
down to 8 percent.
   Bush also proposed a ban on congressional honoraria, such as
outside speaking fees, to be phased in over the next 18 months.
   The White House said the ban on outside income would open the way
to a congressional pay raise, but Bush stopped short of actually
proposing one _ leaving that politically touchy issue for
congressional leaders to decide.
   ``I will work with Congress toward this end,'' Bush said on the
pay raise issue in a letter to House and Senate leaders.
   Bush earlier this year gave his support to a proposed 51 percent
pay raise for members of Congress endorsed by the Reagan
administration, but the plan was rejected in Congress after a public
outcry.
   Bush's package also includes a new super-pay category to enable
200 federal employees with ``specialized and critical skills,'' such
as physicians or space scientists, to earn salaries well above what
their regular pay grades would allow _ up to $124,400 a year.
   That would also be the new pay of Cabinet officers under the pay
plan, up from $99,500 now. And the package would raise Vice
President Dan Quayle's salary, from $99,500 to $124,400.
   The salary of the president, $200,000, would remain unchanged.
   ``The pay of senior government officials has eroded significantly
in relation to the pay of executives in comparable jobs in the
private and not-for-profit sectors of the economy,'' Bush said in
sending the plan to Congress.
   The pay issue was highlighted Friday when Michael F. Ballhaus
Jr., the director of NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
Calif., since 1984, said he was resigning because of low pay and
regulations limiting his employment after government service.
   The basic pay package would cost taxpayers $101 million in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and $147 million the next year. The
provision for a new category of high pay for specialized positions
would add $8 million more in each of the next two years.
   The increases proposed Friday would be in addition to a 3.6
percent cost-of-living increase the president is seeking for all 2.2
million civil service workers.
   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employes Union,
called the package ``unfair, highly political and another karate
chop at the real backbone of the federal work force.
   ``It may stem the tide of flight at the top, but would further
oppress the millions of employees who act as the glue holding the
government together,'' he said.
   However, Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives
Association, which represents members of the federal Senior
Executive Service who would be covered by the proposed pay raise,
said the package was an important first step.
   Still, she added, ``it should also be noted that a 25 percent pay
increase for senior executives, even if the full 25 percent is
received at one time, falls far short of achieving full
comparability with the private sector, state and local governments
and non-profit organizations.''

<HEAD>Analysts See Fed Actions Dropping Prime Rate Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an move that many economists expect will
make borrowing easier, the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions
for the second time in four weeks.
   Analysts predicted the development would send a variety of
consumer and business interest rates lower in coming weeks,
including home mortgage rates and commercial banks' prime-lending
rate.
   One analyst said a one-half percentage point reduction in the
prime rate, the benchmark rate for many consumer loans, could come
as early as Monday. The prime rate stands at 11 percent.
   ``The Fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we have
passed the peak on interest rates,'' said David Wyss, an economist
with DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting company in Lexington,
Mass.
   The Fed began easing its credit policy last month, changing
course after a yearlong effort to drive rates higher as a way of
dampening inflationary pressures.
   That credit squeeze had brought complaints from President Bush
and others that the central bank ran the risk of pushing the country
into a recession.
   The central bank is trying to engineer a so-called
``soft-landing'' for the economy in which growth slows enough to
dampen inflationary pressures but without a recession.
   Economists based their belief that the Fed eased again this week
on a slight decline in the federal funds rate, which edged down 0.25
percentage point to 9.25 percent Thursday and Friday.
   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each
other to make overnight loans. It is influenced by daily decisions
the central bank makes on how much money to make available to the
banking system and is considered the best early warning signal of
Fed intentions to loosen or tighten credit conditions.
   The funds' rate dropped for the first time in a year in early
June, when it declined from 9.75 percent to 9.5 percent.
   Many analysts said they expected to see further 0.25 percentage
point declines over the next several months if inflation moderates
further and various business barometers continue signaling a
slowdown.
   The Labor Department reported Friday the nation's unemployment
rate climbed from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent in June, reflecting
continuing job losses in manufacturing and construction.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, said he expected the Fed's
credit-loosening moves would prompt banks to cut their prime-lending
rate to 10.5 percent, perhaps as early as Monday.
   Other economists predicted that mortgage rates would soon dip
back into the single-digit range, perhaps falling to as low as 9.5
percent for fixed-rate mortgages. Such mortgages stand at 10.03
percent, down from 10.07 percent the previous week, according to a
national survey released Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.
   The latest easing came while Fed policy-makers were holding two
days of meetings as part of their midyear review of monetary
strategy.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will reveal details of
this week's discussions when he delivers the Fed's midyear
assessment of the economy in congressional testimony July 20.
   At a May 16 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Fed
policy-makers decided to leave credit conditions unchanged. However,
they noted a variety of economic statistics pointing to slower
growth, according to minutes of that meeting released Friday.
   The FOMC is composed of members of the Federal Reserve Board in
Washington and five of the 12 Fed regional bank presidents.

<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp says more agency
programs may be suspended, but promises to revive the
scandal-wracked department and ``make sure the money gets to hands
of needy people, not greedy people.''
   Kemp also said Friday that his predecessor, Samuel Pierce, shares
blame for HUD's problems, which congressional and agency
investigators believe have cost the government hundreds of millions,
if not billions, of dollars.
   Kemp promised a thorough review of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development and made his most direct comments to date on his
assessment of Pierce.
   ``I'm making a lot of changes, so that, by definition, is
suggesting that Secretary Pierce unfortunately _ a very decent and
honest man _ did not in my view manage HUD as carefully or closely
as it should have been managed,'' Kemp told reporters after speaking
to a Republican group.
   ``That reflects on Mr. Pierce and, I say this with sadness not
anger, it reflects on the Reagan administration.''
   Kemp said said he and President Bush will be to blame if they are
unsuccessful in reforming the agency, a massive task that involves
major internal reviews of virtually all the agency's major programs.
   Three programs have been suspended or canceled, and Kemp said
``there may be more'' as his review progresses.
   ``But I'm not going to announce them today,'' he said.
   Kemp, in promising to revive the agency, dismissed questions from
the congressman heading a subcommittee investigation of HUD's
problems. Kemp is to testify next week before the subcommittee.
   Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., head of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, said Thursday
that he feared Kemp was using the investigation to kill housing
programs.
   ``I don't want to end the system _ I want to make it work,'' Kemp
said. ``We're going to spend a lot of money but I want to make sure
the money gets to the hands of needy people, not greedy people.''
   Pierce has been recalled to testify before the subcommittee to
face questions about a North Carolina project HUD funded that was
pushed by a one-time law partner of the former HUD secretary.
   A HUD official who approved the funding, Janet Hale, now works at
the Office of Management and Budget and was told late Thursday that
she should steer clear of HUD matters that could be related to the
investigations.
   Ms. Hale's predecessor as deputy secretary of housing, Shirley
McVay Wiseman, has said she quit because Pierce wanted her to
approve the North Carolina project over the objections of career HUD
officials. Pierce promoted Ms. Hale to succeed Wiseman and she
approved the project in 1985.
   Ms. Hale also faces questioning over her response to an audit by
HUD's inspector general that found numerous abuses of a program
under which HUD jointly guaranteed loans for developers with lenders
that HUD now says has cost the agency more than $100 million.
   HUD Inspector General Paul Adams told Congress last week that a
1984 audit found that lenders on eight projects under the program
had inflated appraisals by $36 million and that auditors then
proposed a series of corrective measures to agency officials.

<HEAD>Government Halts Over-the-Counter Remedies for Baldness, Sex Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Food and Drug Administration says people
who turn to over-the-counter potions to prevent baldness or improve
their sex lives aren't getting what they pay for.
   To protect the public from fraudulent claims, the FDA is banning
nonprescription anti-baldness creams and lotions and aphrodisiac
products.
   Though over-the-counter hair-growth products have dwindled in
number since the FDA indicated in 1985 that it wanted to remove the
products from the market, ``they have continued to be an area of
considerable fraud.
   ``The ban of all such products will provide a greater and more
uniform protection to the public,'' the FDA said.
   Few of these types of products are on the market, and those
available usually are sold by mail or through barbers or beauticians.
   ``The industry has been anticipating this for a long time,'' John
T. Walden, a spokesman for the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers
Association, said Friday after the FDA announced plans to ban the
two products.
   The number of companies marketing nonprescription aphrodisiacs
also has shrunk in anticipation of a ban. No manufacturer defended
its product during the agency's review.
   The bans will become effective in six months.
   For anti-baldness products, the ban applies to those available
without a prescription that are used externally.
   The only product approved by the FDA for stimulating hair growth
on the crown of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2 percent
solution of minoxidil, which is applied to the scalp. The drug is
manufactured by The Upjohn Co. and sold under the name Rogaine.
   The FDA also said it will ban on a case-by-case basis vitamins,
food supplements or other products taken orally that claim to grow
hair or retard baldness, because no evidence exists proving they
work.
   An FDA advisory panel recommended the ban after it evaluated a
number of ingredients in anti-baldness medicines, including lanolin,
olive oil, wheat germ oil and vitamins. The panel found none of
these prevented baldness or promoted hair growth.
   The FDA said that once the ban is in effect, manufacturers of any
nonprescription remedy claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair
will have to provide proof that it is safe and effective before it
can be sold.
   Ingredients commonly found in products billed as aphrodisiacs
include cantharides, a chemical derived from the dried bodies of
beetles, estrogens, strychnine, yohimbine, fennel, mandrake, anise,
licorice and zinc, the FDA said.
   Some of these are contained in food products, but none of those
would be covered by the ban unless specifically labeled as an
aphrodisiac.
   The FDA advised people with sexual problems to seek treatment by
a medical professional and not try to medicate themselves. Male sex
hormones affect sexual drive and performance, but because they are
powerful hormones with potentially serious side effects, supplements
of such hormones should be used only under a doctor's care, the
agency added.
   The FDA review of both types of products is part of an ongoing
evaluation of over-the-counter medicines that began in the early
1970s to ensure the safety and effectiveness of all of their
ingredients.
   The American Pharmaceutical Association's Handbook of
Nonprescription Drugs lists no aphrodisiac or anti-baldness products.
   Walden said none of his association's members, who represent 95
percent of the FDA-regulated nonprescription drugs on the market,
markets either type of product.

<HEAD>Airlines Must Respond _ Privately _ to Security Alerts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines must respond to government alerts of
terrorist threats but could face fines if they disclose them to the
public under a Federal Aviation Administration order to take effect
Monday.
   The order replaces the system of issuing security bulletins that
brought criticism from relatives of victims of the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland in December that killed 270 people.
   The new system, however, rejects the relatives' demand that
passengers on any flight be advised of threats against their flight.
Instead, airlines that disclose such threats without FAA
authorization would face a $10,000 fine. Individuals could be fined
$1,000.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who announced the FAA
order Friday, earlier said such disclosures would compromise
security and disrupt commercial aviation.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said the new system for alerting
airlines will include two types of advisories: information circulars
and security directives.
   The information circulars will deal with general threats of
hijackings, bombings or other terrorist actions, Leyden said.
   ``They are basically a heads-up warning and would require no
particular action,'' he said.
   The stronger security directives, however, would require
countermeasures by an airline, such as additional baggage
inspections, Leyden said. These would be in response to specific
threats against an airline, an airport or an individual flight and
might include such information as the threatened time and method of
attack, he said.
   Until now, airlines have not been required to take any specific
actions in response to security bulletins, although steps were
sometimes recommended.
   Before the bombing of Flight 103, notices of threats against U.S.
airlines on the flight's route were posted in at least one foreign
embassy but not distributed to the general public. The State
Department later said the bulletin should not have been posted in
its Moscow embassy and that no information about threats is supposed
to go to government employees that does not also go to the public.
   U.S. and European authorities later said they concluded the
threat was a coincidence and not related to the bombing of Flight
103.
   Other warnings were issued before the flight about the
possibility of plastic explosives concealed in a radio-cassette
player. Investigators concluded that such a bomb caused the Pan Am
explosion, although they have not determined who planted the device.
   The FAA, in a news release on the new order, said airlines have
been responsive to actions suggested in security bulletins, but
making compliance mandatory will strengthen security.
   Since 1986, the FAA has issued 93 security bulletins, about
one-third of them warning of specific threats.
   On Thursday, the FAA announced new rules requiring airlines to
install devices that can detect plastic explosives in checked
luggage at 40 U.S. and foreign airports.
   It did not list the airports, except for John F. Kennedy in New
York and Gatwick in London, and said it would take up to three years
for all the screening devices to be installed.

<HEAD>Democratic Leader, Labor Secretary Address Hispanic Group</HEAD>

   Democrats and Republicans are wooing the
nation's oldest and largest Hispanic group.
   Democratic National Chairman Ronald H. Brown and Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole appeared within hours of each other Friday at the
annual convention of the National League of United Latin American
Citizens _ Brown offering more political clout and Dole more jobs.
   The remarks reflected the value the two parties have placed on
Hispanic voters in recent elections, highlighted last year by
promises from both presidential nominees that they would name a
Hispanic to a Cabinet post.
   Brown told the group that Republicans were merely paying lip
service to Hispanics.
   ``The difference is very stark and distinct,'' said Brown.
``Republicans take a Madison Avenue, media approach. That's the way
you deal with the American public. With little slogans, with little,
oversimplified phrases but with no understanding of what the
problems of people are and how you deal with the problems of people.
Selling candidates ... It's like selling toothpaste or detergent.''
   By contrast, said Brown, ``The Democratic Party is committed to
the economic and political empowerment of the Hispanic Community. I
don't think its just coincidence that every member of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus is a Democrat.''
   Dole, speaking later in the day, emphasized a pending jobs bill
rather than politics.
   Mrs. Dole said her top priority is to reduce minority youth
unemployment and she asked the group's support for a Bush
administration bill that would reform the federal job-training
program.
   The legislation, she said, would add skills training, literacy,
remedial education and counseling provisions to the Job Training
Partnership Act. She urged members of the group to attend a Senate
subcommittee session next week at which the bill will be drafted.
   She also pledged more jobs at her department for Hispanics. She
said Hispanic employment at the Transportation Department rose by 25
percent while she was secretary during the Reagan administration,
and said, ``I intend to get the same results at the Department of
Labor.''
   Brown said that for Democrats ``there is nothing more crucial
than the 1990 census'' in its efforts to reach minorities. He said
the party will be working to make sure Hispanics and blacks who
might not be counted do end up on the Census Bureau rolls.
   The 1990 census will be used in redrawing congressional district
boundaries.
   The Census Bureau estimated the Hispanic population at 17{
million in 1985.

   A clam boat rammed the Trump Princess,
leaving a 3-foot hole in the luxury yacht's outer hull and riling
its billionaire owner, Donald Trump.
   The 140-foot Nantucket had just unloaded a catch of clams when
its engine jammed and it struck the Princess portside early Friday
morning, said Sgt. Carl Allen of the New Jersey State Marine Police.
   There were no injuries, he said, and no damage to the inner hull
of the 282-foot vessel, which boasts a disco, movie theater and
hand-carved onyx toilets.
   ``It really was no more than a bump,'' said Bill Gifford, who
owns the marina where the clam boat unloaded, ``but when you bump a
$40 million yacht owned by Donald Trump, you can expect to have
problems.''
   Indeed. In a terse statement released from his New York office,
Trump said: ``The people who did it were totally incompetent. It
never should have happened.''
   Trump said he will seek damages. Gifford said he expects his
insurance company will cover all costs.

   The Duchess of York has cut a $125,000 deal with
Redbook magazine for serial rights to her first two children's books
about a heroic helicopter.
   ``Budgie The Helicopter'' will appear in the magazine's September
issue, which will be on newsstands next month, Redbook Editor in
Chief Annette Capone said Friday.
   The wife of Prince Andrew has penned one other ``Budgie''
adventure: ``Budgie at Bendick Point.'' The title character's name
comes from the nickname the duchess gave to the chopper in which she
learned to fly.
   Capone described the books as about ``the adventures of a feisty
little helicopter named Budgie who heroically risks his life to come
to the aid of children who find themselves in a jam.''
   The books, illustrated by John Richardson, will be published in
September. Part of the duchess' income will be donated to charity.

   A judge put Jake ``The Snake'' Roberts
in the slammer pending sentencing after his conviction for punching
a drinking partner.
   Circuit Judge Gayle Graziano ordered Roberts _ whose real name is
Aurelian Smith Jr. _ locked up after he was convicted Wednesday of
aggravated battery. The action revoked Roberts' $2,500 bail and
forced him to await sentencing in the Volusia County Jail.
   The 34-year-old Roberts _ who got his stage name from the 8-foot
boa constrictor he carries in the ring _ was arrested May 8 in
Orlando.
   A jury convicted the 6-foot-5-inch, 249-pound wrestler of
punching 5-foot-7-inch, 160-pound John Bartlett in the face and
abdomen after a night of drinking in December.
   Bartlett, 27, told police he met Roberts at a bar. While later
riding in a car, Roberts made disparaging remarks about Daytona
Beach and its women, Bartlett said.
   When Bartlett defended Daytona Beach, the wrestler stopped the
car and slugged him, Bartlett told police.
   Roberts testified that Bartlett started the fight and that
Roberts just defended himself.
   Bartlett, who said he needed surgery to repair the bone around
his eye, said he was pleased with the verdict.
   Aggravated battery carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in
prison, but sentencing guidelines call for 12 to 30 months for
those, like Roberts, with no record.

   Emperor Akihito has paid taxes on his share of the
$13.4 million estate of his late father, Hirohito, the government
announced.
   The Imperial Household Agency, which manages palace affairs, said
Friday that the possessions of Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer
Jan. 7, were divided equally between his son and his mother, Empress
Dowager Nagako.
   The government statement did not disclose the amount of tax
Akihito paid. Nagako was entitled to a tax exemption as the spouse
of the deceased and did not pay any tax, it said.
   Excluded from the tax assessment were the three sacred treasures
_ a sword, mirror and curved jewel _ which symbolize the imperial
institution. Also exempted: more than 3,000 art objects collected by
the imperial family, which will be donated to the country, and a
$360,000 contribution to the Japan Red Cross.
   It was the first time the imperial family has revealed the value
of its possessions.

   The Dalai Lama, who was chased from
his Tibetan homeland 30 years ago by Chinese troops, said the recent
massacre of students in Beijing mirrored the repression Tibet has
suffered.
   `Of course, it is a very sad event, a kind of self-destruction,''
the Dalai Lama said Friday of the army assault on Tiananmen Square
last month.``We have experienced the same since last March in Tibet.
It has been a tragedy.''
   Tibet has been under martial law since March 5, when bloody
protests marked the 30th anniversary of an unsuccessful three-week
uprising against Chinese rule. The Dalai Lama was forced to flee the
country March 31, 1959.
   Despite the crackdown, the Dalai Lama said Chinese students would
win their struggle for democracy as long as they refrain from
violence. ``I always have believed in human determination and the
human spirit to overcome,'' he said at a news conference.
   The religious leader revered by most Tibetans as a living Buddha
is on a 17-day visit to Los Angeles to address followers of the
2,500-year-old faith.

   Chinese authorities ordered the expulsion of
another American reporter Saturday, charging him with violating his
visa status and the terms of martial law.
   Mark Hopkins, correspondent for the U.S. government-run Voice of
America radio network, was given 72 hours to leave the country, said
VOA Director Richard W. Carlson in a telephone interview from
Washington.
   Hopkins was called in Saturday morning to the Beijing State
Security Bureau and was accused of breaking martial law, instigated
propaganda and violating the terms of his tourist visa, Carlson said.
   ``We reject all the allegations,'' Carlson said. ``They're mad at
the messenger.''
   Hopkins was the second VOA reporter and the fourth American
journalist ordered out of the country since the June 3-4 military
crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. A total of
seven foreign journalists have been ordered expelled from China.
   VOA Beijing Bureau Chief Alan Pessin was given three days to
leave China June 14 for violating martial law, which virtually
prohibits news reporting in Beijing, and spreading rumors and
propaganda against China.
   John Pomfret, a Beijing-based correspondent from The Associated
Press, and a reporter from the Dallas Morning News also have been
expelled from China.
   Hopkins, a former VOA bureau chief in Beijing, works in the
shortwave radio network's bureau in Boston, and is on temporary
assignment in China.
   Carlson said Chinese authorities have been jamming VOA broadcasts
into China since May 21.

<HEAD>Report: Credentials of VA Physicians Not Being Checked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnam Veterans group says people with
service-connected disabilities should be able to get government-paid
care from the doctor of their choice because VA hospitals are
falling down on the job.
   The 35,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America issued the call
Friday after details of a draft report by the General Accounting
Office critical of the Department of Veterans Affairs was published
in The Washington Post.
   The report by the government watchdog agency said officials were
unable to prove they had checked the licenses of more than half the
doctors the VA hired between 1986 and 1988.
   ``If the government is unable to provide acceptable health care
through the veterans hospital system, then these veterans should
have the right to seek medical treatment elsewhere,'' Mary R. Stout,
president of the veterans group, said in a statement.
   In its statement, the Vietnam Veterans group referred as well to
a report of high mortality rates at VA hospitals. The new report
also noted that some medical residents at the nation's 172 VA
hospitals had criminal arrest records that went unreported.
   The Department of Veterans Affairs disputed the reasoning used by
the Vietnam Veterans group.
   ``Any attempt to connect the mortality review or the GAO report
with the quality of care is totally inappropriate,'' said
spokeswoman Donna St. John, explaining that mortality rates fail to
reflect the condition of the patients who enter a particular
hospital. Hospices, for example, have reported 100 percent rates.
   She noted the GAO report, according to the Post, said: ``The
conditions cited do not mean that the medical services provided by
the VA are substandard or that VA physicians are incompetent.''
   The study was requested by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,
ranking minority member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
His staff said it could not release a copy of the report because it
was in draft form. The VA said it could not release the draft
report, either.
   The full report, with VA comment, is due for release in August.
   Murkowski wrote a 1985 law telling the VA to act on problems at
hospitals after the American Medical Association found 87 doctors
with revoked, suspended or restricted licenses who were working for
the agency.
   VA officials said they could prove they had checked the licenses
of only 105 of the 207 physicians hired from 1986 to 1988, the draft
report said. The report also said the VA had not fulfilled promises
to ensure that its doctors are qualified to practice their
particular specialties.
   A further problem was detected with medical residents who work at
VA hospitals, according to the draft report. The government watchdog
agency said a records check with the FBI found that 165 of the
16,756 residents had been charged with criminal offenses between the
early 1970s and May 1987, the Post reported.
   Among the more serious offenses were 68 charged with drunken
driving and 67 charged with drug violations, five with vandalism and
five with burglary. The records did not indicate how many charges
led to convictions.

<TEXT>
   Members of AT&amp;T's two unions will take part in
the company's first profit-sharing plan for union workers under new
contracts ratified by the workers.
   The Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said Friday the contracts were
ratified by ``huge margins'' in secret balloting by every bargaining
unit nationwide.
   The unions did not provide a breakdown on the voting.
   The three-year contracts, which call for varying pay raises and a
package of family-related benefits, cover an estimated 140,000
workers at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   The unions, which negotiated jointly with the company for the
first time, are negotiating separate contracts with the regional
telephone companies spawned by the 1984 AT&amp;T breakup. Those
contracts expire over the next month.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen called the agreements ``the most
progressive ... we've ever negotiated as a company.''
   Tentative agreement on the pacts was reached May 28, several
hours after the prior contracts were to expire.
   The contracts give operations employees _ primarily operators,
technicians and clerical and administrative staff _ a 4 percent pay
increase immediately, a 2.5 percent boost next year and a 2.25
percent raise in the final year of the contract.
   AT&amp;T manufacturing workers are due an 8 percent lump sum payment
immediately after ratification; those in skilled trades will also
get a 50-cents-an-hour pay raise. All manufacturing workers will get
a 3.5 percent base wage increase next year and a 3 percent raise in
the final year.
   The formula for the profit-sharing plan should provide each AT&amp;T
worker about $700 in the first year of the contract, based on the
company's 1988 earnings, according to company and union officials.
   Other features of the contracts include a $5 million fund to
expand child-care opportunities for union workers and a series of
new or expanded leave policies for union workers who become parents
or who have a sick child or parent.
   The unions and AT&amp;T also reached agreement on steps designed to
curb the company's rising health care costs and agreed to work with
other interested parties in encouraging government efforts in that
area.

<TEXT>
   A federal court complaint alleging
illegal fishing was filed Friday against two Canadian vessels seized
off southeast Alaska, and the crews were to return to Canada without
their boats.
   Canada, meanwhile, filed a protest with the State Department in
Washington, D.C., demanding release of the boats seized by the U.S.
Coast Guard in waters claimed by the United States southeast of
Ketchikan.
   Mark Davis, acting U.S. attorney for Alaska, filed the complaint
in U.S. District Court at Anchorage, citing violations of the
federal Magnuson Act. The complaint seeks forfeiture of the vessels,
the gear and the fish on board.
   The 4,000 pounds of salmon aboard each boat was sold to a
Ketchikan cannery Friday and the proceeds were to be held by the
court pending resolution of the complaint, officials said.
   No criminal action was planned against the crew members, said
Timothy Burgess, an assistant U.S. attorney in Anchorage. ``This
action is only against the vessels themselves,'' he said.
   Mike Harpold, a federal immigration agent in Ketchikan, said the
crew members avoided immigration charges by voluntarily returning to
Canada. The four men and three women were to leave Ketchikan late
Friday night.
   The crews had been held on their boats at the Ketchikan Coast
Guard base since Wednesday, Coast Guard spokesman Ed Moreth said
from Juneau.
   The vessels were escorted to Ketchikan after they were boarded
Wednesday in disputed waters. Burgess said the boats were first seen
fishing in undisputed U.S. waters north of the Canadian-claimed
boundary.
   Malcolm McKechnie, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in
Washington, said his government issued a verbal protest over the
incident Wednesday and delivered a formal diplomatic protest note to
the State Department Friday.
   ``We would like to see the immediate release of the vessels and
their crews,'' McKechnie said.
   He said the boats, the Viscount and the Fonzie, were seized after
a ``hot pursuit'' in disputed waters. Because jurisdiction over the
area is disputed, ``we believe there should be restraint
exercised,'' McKechnie said.
   ``What took place was a divergence from the normal practice of
restraint,'' he said.
   The Coast Guard said the Canadian vessels were found fishing
illegally in U.S. waters of Dixon Entrance, between Southeast Alaska
and Canada's Queen Charlotte Islands.
   The Coast Guard said the cutter Cape Hatteras found the boats
fishing about one-quarter mile north of the Dixon Entrance boundary
that Canada claims.
   The Viscount was carrying a crew of four and was under the
supervision of master Bruce Devereau of Vancouver, British Columbia.
Howard Wilson of Parksville, British Columbia, was master of the
Fonzie, which had three crew members.
   The United States and Canada have not agreed on fishing
boundaries in the area involved, despite efforts at negotiations
since 1903.
   Moreth said it is the first time Canadian fishing vessels have
been detained off Alaska in the last couple of years.
   Devereux told Canadian Press his vessel was boarded in Canadian
waters and he was roughed up. Coast Guardsmen jumped aboard the
Viscount without permission and ``threatened to use whatever force
was necessary'' to take the the boat into port, he said Friday.
   Devereux said two Coast Guardsmen came aboard and slammed him
against a stove with a club. Crewman Brad Dean was briefly
handcuffed, he said.
   Another crew member, Dianne Cheadle, protested Devereux's
treatment.
   ``I said, `Hey, you can't do this. He's the skipper, he's got
control of this boat,''' Cheadle said.
   Moreth said none of the crew members had filed complaints about
their treatment. ``We did get information that the captain of the
Viscount was very uncooperative,'' he said.

   A fired plant worker shot two of his
supervisors, killing one of them, and briefly took a co-worker
hostage at a Coca-Cola plant late Friday, police said.
   The worker, identified as 45-year-old John Wallace, was believed
to be holed up in the Coca-Cola Distribution Center after releasing
the hostage unharmed late Friday.
   Cobb County Police Chief Culver Johnson said Wallace came to work
at the plant in this Atlanta suburb shortly before 10 p.m. and was
told of his dismissal. The reason for his firing was not immediately
known.
   Witnesses told police Wallace went to clean out his locker and
returned armed with a small handgun and fired on some workers,
shooting two of them.
   A caller telephoned WSB-TV in Atlanta and identified himself as
Wallace, telling reporters he had shot two men and was holding a
hostage. Police said station officials acted as negotiators by
telephone until police took over. Part of the telephone conversation
was televised.
   Asked by WSB whom he had shot, the caller said, ``Two men'' but
said later he wasn't sure if they were dead.
   Although the first victim was removed about a half-hour after the
shooting, the other was not moved until 11:15 p.m. and died on the
scene.
   The victims' names were not released Friday night.
   Police said Wallace then took one man hostage for more than an
hour after the shootings, but that man was released shortly after
the slain victim was brought out.
   Officials at Kennestone Hospital in Marietta said the second
shooting victim was in serious condition.

   China today ordered another American journalist to
leave the country after it launched a new round of denunciations of
the United States and other foreign critics.
   Mark Hopkins, correspondent for the U.S. government-run Voice of
America radio network, was given 72 hours to leave China, said VOA
Director Richard W. Carlson in a telephone interview from Washington.
   Hopkins was called this morning to the Beijing State Security
Bureau and accused of breaking martial law, instigating propaganda
and violating the terms of his tourist visa, Carlson said.
   ``We reject all the allegations,'' Carlson said. ``They're mad at
the messenger.''
   Hopkins was the second VOA reporter and the fourth American
journalist ordered out of the country since the crackdown against
pro-democracy protesters began in Beijing on June 3-4. A total of
seven foreign journalists have been ordered expelled from China.
   On the domestic front, Communist Party hardliners who called the
army in to put down student pro-democracy protesters appeared
determined to wipe out moral and cultural backsliding as well as
political dissent.
   A forum organized by the party Propaganda Department denounced
the spread of pornography and blamed it on ousted party chief Zhao
Ziyang, while police raided Beijing book stalls and confiscated
banned books. One province ordered that copies of a banned book be
burned.
   A high-level government advisory body, the Chinese People's
Political Consulative Conference, adopted a resolution condemning
what it called ``the anti-China wave stirred up by the reactionary
forces in the West.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported the resolution, which
also vowed to ``continue to develop friendly ties with all
countries.''
   Many governments deplored China's June 3-4 army attack on the
student-led protesters for a freer society. The United States, Japan
and European countries imposed limited economic sanctions.
   China has responded with a series of increasingly defensive
statements reflecting a siege mentality not seen in more than a
decade.
   The media directed its sharpest words against the United States,
which it accused of human rights violations in its treatment of
minorities and demonstrators.
   ``Is America in any position to say anything to China?'' asked a
commentary in the party newspaper, the People's Daily.
   China accused France of violating international law by allowing
two Chinese fugitives to criticize China from French soil.
   The two, student leader Wu'er Kaixi and leading political
theorist Yan Jiaqi, were believed to be in Paris on Monday when they
announced a new coalition to fight for freedom in China.
   On Monday, China filed a protest about French demonstrators who
occupied part of China's embassy in Paris for several hours.
   Xinhua said China's U.N. ambassador, Ding Yuanhong, sent a letter
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, rejecting a
charge by El Salvador that the crackdown was a human rights
violation.
   China took a softer tone toward Hong Kong and Macao, whose
residents have been among the most outspoken in condemning the
crackdown.
   Jiang Zemin, the new party general secretary, told a delegation
from Hong Kong and Macao that China would abide by its ``one
country, two systems'' policy under which they could keep their
capitalist systems for 50 years after reverting to Chinese rule.
Britain is scheduled to return Hong Kong to China in 1997, and
Portugal returns Macao in 1999.
   According to Xinhua, however, Jiang emphasized the need to end
``erroneous ideological trends'' and ``unfair distribution of
income'' in China _ comments not likely to reassure residents of the
free-wheeling enclaves.
   Conservative party officials now firmly in power after several
years of eclipse appeared anxious to seize the opportunity to excise
cultural as well as political deviations. The Propaganda Department
organized a forum of writers and artists to demand a cleanup of what
one speaker called ``all sorts of garbage (that have) appeared in
our society.''
   Parts of the forum were shown on television.
   Under Zhao, ``there was no distinction between right and wrong,''
said Zhang Jigong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences. ``Sex and violence filled the literary market.''
   The Beijing Evening News said police in Beijing's university
district raided book stalls and confiscated ``a large number'' of
banned books and magazines. It described the books as containing
pornography, violence and ``reactionary superstition.''
   Authorities also went after books with politically suspect
contents. In northwestern Shaanxi province, censors banned a book
that praised a Chinese journalist, Liu Binyan, who is in the United
States and has condemned the crackdown. An editor who worked on the
book was fired.

<HEAD>Government Proposes $1.9 Million Fine Against Ford Subsidiary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is seeking nearly $2 million in
fines from a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary that allegedly failed to
properly record injuries and illnesses in violation of an agreement
reached with the automaker two years ago.
   Ford Electronics and Refrigeration Corp. of Lansdale, Pa., has 15
working days to contest the fine proposed Friday by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.
   OSHA said the company had willfully ignored a 1987 agreement
between the agency and Ford in which the automaker settled
worker-safety complaints at two other plants and agreed to a
company-wide reform of its record keeping practices relating to
illnesses and injuries.
   A Ford spokesman said company officials were reviewing the
citations and had no immediate comment.
   The Pennsylvania subsidiary was cited for 241 willful violations
of the agreement for allegedly misrecording or failing to record
injuries and illnesses. It also was cited for serious violations for
allegedly overexposing workers to the hazards of lasers and
repetitive motion.
   ``Other employers who enter into agreements with OSHA to abate
job safety and health violations and hazards should realize that
this case shows we mean business about enforcing settlement
agreements,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in announcing the
proposed fine.
   The action stems from OSHA inspections of the Lansdale plant that
began earlier this year following an employee complaint about
exposure to asbestos, OSHA said. The agency said the plant employs
about 2,600 workers and manufactures auto parts such as cruise
control units and fuel injection systems.
   Willful violations are defined as situations in which the
employer knew of a violation of OSHA standards or was aware that a
hazardous condition existed but made no attempt to correct it.
Serious violations cover alleged offenses in which the employer knew
or should have known a workplace activity posed a substantial
probability of death or serious physical harm.
   If Ford contests the fine, the case would be referred to an
administrative law judge, who would hold hearings on the matter. If
either side appeals a judge's finding, the case is referred to the
quasi-judicial Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Any
appeals from that proceeding would go to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces B-2 Flight Test This Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-awaited test flight of the B-2 stealth
bomber will be held later this month, the Pentagon has announced.
   The outdoor tests and flight will be held during a 15-day period
beginning Sunday, the Pentagon said Friday.
   The controversial plane, manufactured by Northrop Corp., has been
undergoing a final check at an Air Force plant in Palmdale, Calif.
It has been described as the most radical and expensive bomber ever
built and has become the target of Capitol Hill budget cutters.
   Critics in Congress oppose paying the bill for planes, which
could cost between $500 million and $750 million each, before the
first plane has ever gotten off the ground. The Air Force already
has invested $22 billion in the program, expected to cost taxpayers
a total of $70 billion.
   The B-2 has no sharp angles or conventional fuselage and relies
on the radar-absorbing coatings on its surface to avoid detection.
   During the 15-day period, the plane is expected to be rolled out
of its hangar and undergo a series of dress rehearsal tests that
include turning on its engines, slow- and high-speed taxi tests on
the runway, and a full flight test.
   For its initial flight, the Air Force will take the plane from
Palmdale for a test flight expected to last about 2{ hours, landing
at Edwards Air Force Base about 40 miles away, said Air Force
spokeswoman Capt. Tess Taft. The tests may take several days.
   ``Only after it looks perfect, and everything looks right, will
they take it up,'' Taft said, explaining the 15-day test window.
   While the news media will be allowed to observe the outdoor
tests, the public is not invited, the Pentagon said. The specific
date and time of the tests will not be announced, but the media will
be told by mid morning if no tests are scheduled for a particular
day.
   The Air Force will hold a news conference after the first flight,
the statement said.
   While the B-2 has not been operationally tested in the field,
individual systems have been tried. The Air Force says the B-2 will
not be deployed before 1991.

<HEAD>North Will Start Community Service While Appealing Conviction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North wants to perform 1,200 hours of
community service in an anti-drug program imposed as part of his
sentence while appealing three Iran-Contra convictions.
   North's attorneys filed a motion for a stay Friday of the
$150,000 fine imposed by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell but
added the former White House aide ``would like to begin promptly the
important community service program ordered by the court.''
   Gesell on Wednesday ordered North to perform the community
service by helping administer a new program to help District of
Columbia youths living in public housing avoid drugs.
   The judge told North the work involved applying his
administrative and organizational skills to ``a program targeted to
see if we can't stop the scourge of drugs that hits the young people
of this city.''
   Defense lawyers said North was anxious to begin work because ``we
understand that the next six to 12 months is a critical `start-up'
period during which the program could best use the assistance of Lt.
Col. North.''
   North was also placed on two years' probation for his conviction
on charges of aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress,
destroying or altering government documents and illegally accepting
a home security system.
   In another development Friday, fund-raiser Carl R. ``Spitz''
Channell was placed on two years' probation for illegally using a
tax-exempt foundation to help North raise donations for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris cited Channell's early
cooperation with the investigation by independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh after his April 29, 1987, guilty plea to conspiring to
defraud the Treasury.
   The judge said ``it makes it very difficult'' to impose a
sentence ``when crimes have been committed by someone so firmly
dedicated to furthering the interests of the country.''
   Channell could have received a five-year sentence and fined up to
$250,000 for his guilty plea. He admitted raising $2 million through
the tax-exempt National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty
for the non-deductible purpose of purchasing weapons for the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   The foundation, which Channell headed, used White House briefings
and private meetings between prospective donors and then-President
Reagan to raise $10 million for the Contras at a time U.S. military
aid was banned by Congress.
   Channell was sentenced a day after Harris ordered Channell's
former associate, Richard R. Miller, who also pleaded guilty to
misusing the tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the Contras,
to perform 120 hours of community service in addition to two years'
probation.
   Miller and Channel both testified for the prosecution at North's
trial.

<HEAD>President To Offer English Teachers To Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is prepared to offer to send
English teachers to Hungary when he visits Budapest next week, a
move that would be establish the first informal U.S. Peace Corps
mission to a European country.
   U.S. officials said Friday that the project is part of a package
of proposals Bush is examining as he prepares to travel to Poland
and Hungary.
   He mostly will offer economic assistance, provided government
leaders in Poland and Hungary commit themselves to austerity
programs, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The programs would accelerate U.S. cultural and business ties
with the Soviet bloc nations as they open up their political
systems. Hungary, in particular, has been moving its Marxist economy
toward a free-market system.
   Bush, who leaves for Poland on Sunday, is visiting the East
European countries on his way to a seven-nation economic summit
meeting in Paris.
   Hungary two years ago suspended Russian as a compulsory language
in schools. The U.S. hope is that English will become more common.
   Poland, which carries the burden of a $36 billion debt, is hoping
for financial aid.
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters at the White House,
dismissed reports that Warsaw expected $10 billion in U.S. or
Western help. But he left open the possibility of a more modest
economic program, which Bush would coordinate with the leaders of
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany at the
economic summit.

<TEXT>
   A civil rights group says a ruling by a federal
appeals court that the Education Department may be sued to seek
stricter enforcement of laws is an important step toward reviving a
major civil rights case.
   A panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia on Friday reversed a lower court's ruling that students in
18 states lacked legal standing to bring the case to speed up
desegregation of public schools and state colleges.
   On the basis of his 1987 ruling, U.S. District Judge John H.
Pratt had dissolved two 1983 orders that set timetables for the
Education Department's review of desegregation plans submitted by
states for public schools and universities.
   In Friday's ruling, a three-judge panel held the plaintiffs had a
``direct stake in the effective enforcement of anti-discrimination
laws'' because they were enrolled in schools, colleges or
universities ``that engaged in proscribed discrimination.''
   ``Plaintiffs in this action, beyond question, are the intended
beneficiaries of the statutes under which they sue'' and could prove
a direct harm if the laws are not enforced, the panel ruled in an
opinion by Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg.
   While the court did not issue a final judgment in the case
pending resolution of other significant legal issues, the decision
was hailed by the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., as
an important step toward reviving the case.
   ``It's very crucial that the courts have upheld our right to sue
under these civil rights statutes,'' said Janell M. Byrd, an
attorney for the New York-based organization.
   ``Judge Pratt's ruling would have closed the door not only on
this litigation, it would make it very difficult to sue the federal
government for failure to enforce a statute,'' she said.
   The suit, which dates back to the Nixon administration, produced
court decisions by Pratt ordering the government to revoke federal
aid to segregated schools and universities under the 1964 Civil
Rights Act.
   It resulted in a series of court orders and a 1977 consent decree
under which the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and
later the Department of Education, were given timetables for
reviewing discrimination complaints and later plans for ending the
last vestiges of segregation.
   The Reagan administration sought in 1982 to dissolve the 1977
consent decree, saying it could not be legally bound by an agreement
entered into by the Carter administration.
   That issue is now before the appeals court along with several
others that remain as legal hurdles for civil rights lawyers seeking
to revive the case.
   The case involved enforcement of desegregation laws against
schools and universities in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia,
West Virginia, and Texas.

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once burned, twice shy, goes the adage, and
Yellowstone National Park officials who watched their forest go up
in smoke last year are ready to douse any blaze at a moment's notice.
   A year after massive fires charred nearly half of the park, its
administrators have beefed up fire crews, obtained a new helicopter
and other gear. They are determined not to allow a wet spring lull
them.
   They are armed as well with a new federal mandate to squelch
fires in the nation's forests.
   ``We could have four to five crews (80 to 100 people) on a fire
line within four to five hours if it is warranted,'' park
spokeswoman Sandy Robinson said this week in a telephone interview.
``That's excellent response time.''
   No substantial fires have been reported in Yellowstone this
summer, but just 150 miles to the south of the park a 2,400-acre
fire was burning Friday in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, and
there were out-of-control wildfires in Utah and California.
   Under a policy begun in 1972, Yellowstone crews in previous years
let naturally caused fires burn unless they threatened people or
structures.
   But last year, more than 200 fires seared an estimated 1.3
million acres of the park and surrounding national forests,
radically altering the face of the most venerated national park.
   Last month, the Interior Department announced it was suspending
the let-burn policies in national parks and forests.
   In addition, it ordered a moratorium on controlled, or limited
fires. George Berklacy, a spokesman for the National Park Service,
said at the time that he doubted the moratorium would be lifted this
summer.
   One hundred park employees are ready to leave their jobs as
naturalists, security guards and rangers and head into the
Yellowstone backcountry to tackle fires, Robinson said.
   Three lookout towers have been manned since June 15 at
Yellowstone and will be staffed until Sept. 30, with a fourth tower
staffed on a part-time basis, Robinson said.
   ``All reports of smoke are being checked out,'' she said.
   Several false alarms turned out to be dust devils or steam rising
from thermal areas, she said.
   While the 2.2 million-acre park in the northwest corner of
Wyoming has enjoyed a relatively wet spring and early summer, record
high temperatures this weekend may signal the beginning of the fire
season, Robinson said.
   ``We always have a high degree of preparedness,'' Robinson said.
``We are more prepared this year in part due to the firefighting
efforts of last year.''
   Hundreds of firefighters were marshaled to battle last year's
blazes while a debate raged among naturalists and government
administrators on whether the policy to let the fires burn made
sense.
   The park has added a helicopter and now has two of the craft to
dump water on fires, and a six-person crew trained for a chopper
assault on any fire that flares up, Robinson said.
   An extra 75 to 80 employees have been trained to fight fires,
giving Yellowstone 275 employees with red cards _ the firefighting
certificate, Robinson said.
   ``We have 100 that are already outfitted, that we can call out
immediately,'' she said.
   Yellowstone also has 100 new chain saws and two new water pumps.
   Robinson said the park itself is better prepared for the 1989
fire season because last summer's fires consumed much of the
available dead wood and created natural fire lines; fire that
reaches recently burned areas burns itself out.
   Park firefighters already have had one chance to test their
preparedness.
   On June 14, a small fire caused by a spark from a cleanup
operation burned one-tenth of an acre at Craig Pass, southeast of
Old Faithful. A crew drove to the site, rappeled down the slope and
doused the fire with hand tools and bags of water.

   Businesses looking to expand in congested
cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco usually turn to
skyscrapers or the suburbs, but a group of engineers and architects
says a better solution lies just below the surface.
   Building underground has the potential to provide millions of
square feet of clean, energy-efficient space in the nation's major
cities, according to the American Underground-Space Association.
   ``Underground has the benefit of allowing greater density in
urban areas and mitigating the need for sprawl,'' Susan Nelson, the
group's executive director, said in a recent interview. ``You save
land doing that, you save energy and transportation, and you just
create a more vital city center.''
   Getting that message across, however, has proven to be difficult
for the Minneapolis-based, non-profit organization.
   ``Visibility really is a major problem with underground
construction,'' Nelson acknowledges. ``I think you'll find that many
architects aren't interested in it because they like to make a
statement. It's hard to make a statement underground.''
   Since it was founded in 1976, the association has been touting
the benefits of underground facilities to business and government
leaders and helping exchange information among professionals
interested in the idea. The group now has 400 members in 39 states
and 25 countries.
   Subterranean buildings are ideal for researchers and
industrialists who need clean work environments because few airborne
pollutants can invade the underground, Nelson said.
   They also save energy because the ground offers protection from
cold winter winds and the hot summer sun, but energy concerns have
waned along with the price of oil in recent years.
   ``I think there was more activity in the late '70s when we were
more concerned about energy,'' Nelson said. ``I think it's a matter
of not being presented with the idea.''
   To help remedy that, the association recently published a book
titled ``Groundworks'' featuring 15 underground projects built in
North America during the 1980s.
   They include the Law Library Addition at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor, all three stories of which are below ground;
the Smithsonian Institution Museum Complex in Washington, D.C.,
which is 96 percent below ground and extends 60 feet below the
surface; and the Civil and Mineral Engineering Building at the
University of Minnesota, which is 95 percent below ground and goes
down 110 feet.
   Also featured is the Minnesota Correctional Facility, a
maximum-security prison in suburban Oak Park Heights.
   The five-story prison's exterior walls are almost completely
earth-covered, minimizing its visibility and providing another
barrier to escape, said Assistant Warden James Crawford.
   Crawford said he has heard no complaints from prisoners or
employees at the 7-year-old facility.
   ``They have access to the outside,'' he said of the 400 inmates.
``Of course, all of their cells have windows'' facing a central
courtyard.
   Not surprisingly, Nelson's own office is located in a so-called
earth-bermed building near downtown Minneapolis. The four-story
building's first floor is built below ground, and earth has been
built up to cover the second and third floors on two sides of the
building.
   Misconceptions are holding back more widespread use of
underground space, Nelson contends.
   ``There is the myth out there that it is very expensive,'' she
said. Cost depends on the difficulty of digging in a particular
spot, and in some places it's inexpensive, she said.
   ``There's also a psychological aspect,'' Nelson said. ``I think
they feel they will be claustrophobic. They don't like the idea of
no windows. But you can work in a skyscraper and never walk past a
window during the day.
   ``I think the expectation of being underground is quite different
from the reality. People who work underground generally like it.''

   President and former baseball coach George Bush
took time out from preparations for his upcoming trip to communist
Europe to talk baseball with 4,000 Little Leaguers.
   ``In Little League, all that matters is the size of your heart
and of your dreams,'' he told the youths Friday.
   Bush and the young players, wearing uniforms identifying them as
Indians, Mets, Springfield, Rocco's Rockettes, and Parkland Blue
Jays, met on the South Lawn to mark the founding of Little League 50
years ago in Williamsport, Pa.
   Baseball greats such as Stan Musial, Mike Schmidt, Brooks
Robinson, Gary Carter, Ted Sizemore, Joe Morgan and Jim Palmer also
attended the ceremony.
   The president repeated a line that Babe Ruth delivered to a crowd
in Yankee Stadium when he was dying of cancer:
   ``You know, the only real game in the world, I think, is
baseball. You've got to start from way down when you are 6 or 7
years old and if you try hard enough you're bound to come out on
top.''
   With those words, said the president, Ruth ``defined why Little
League baseball has become an American, indeed, an international
institution.''

   Adm. William J. Crowe, retiring head of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, says his historic 11-day visit to the Soviet
Union revealed the superpowers are entering a period of ``uneasy
transition.''
   Crowe, in a speech Friday before the National Press Club, said
such circumstances do ``not ... make me feel comfortable.''
   He said he hopes the two military giants are moving toward a new
era in the superpower relationship, but ``to conclude that we are
already there would be a serious mistake.''
   The 64-year-old admiral, speaking a day after President Bush
rejected a new call from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for
talks to eliminate short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, said he
believes U.S. should avoid ``dramatic counter-responses'' to Kremlin
initiatives ``at this point.''
   Crowe met for more than an hour with Gorbachev two weeks ago in
Moscow during his precedent-setting tour of once-secret Soviet
military installations and visits with Soviet military officers.
   It was the first formal visit of a Joint Chiefs chairman to the
Soviet Union and was the latest in a series of high-level visits
designed to dispel distrust between the superpowers.

<NOTE>Lawmakers Says Government Will Buy $15 Million Worth Of Apples</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Agriculture will buy $15
million worth of apples in an effort to help reduce a huge surplus
created when consumers stopped buying amid fears over use of the
chemical Alar.
   The industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of
apples from last year's crop, valued at between $40 million and $56
million, remain unsold.
   The department Friday said apple stocks were 53 percent greater
on May 31 than the average for that date for the previous three
years, and prices to growers had fallen by $3 to $4 per carton from
what they were a year ago.
   The top grade of red apples produced in Washington state were
recently selling for between $7.50 and $8 per box, about $2 below
the cost of production. The nation's 20,000 apple growers have
estimated losses at well over $100 million in sales.
   Alar is used to enhance red color, to ease harvesting by delaying
ripening so that most apples ripen together, and to lengthen shelf
and storage life. The chemical penetrates throughout the fruit
tissue and cannot be washed off like many pesticides.
   The Alar controversy began in late February when a private
environmental advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said apples treated with the chemical substantially increase the
risk of cancer in children.

<NOTE>Oil-Eating Microorganisms May Munch on Alaskan Oil Spill</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental Protection Agency officials say
they are optimistic that oil-eating microorganisms may soon become
valuable tools in cleaning up the Exxon oil spill in Alaska.
   Preliminary findings from an experiment in which nutrients were
used to enhance the growth of such organisms on small sections of
Alaska's contaminated beaches appear to show success, EPA
Administrator William Reilly said Friday.
   In some cases, the number of organisms multiplied 100-fold only a
week into the experiment, and even in the early stages some beaches
treated with nutrients showed ``a striking disappearance of the oil
from rock surfaces,'' the EPA said.
   Reilly said that the results were ``potentially good news'' and
that if the preliminary findings hold up, Exxon Corp. may begin
later this summer to treat large sections of beach with nutrients to
enhance oil-eating microorganism growth.
   Eric Brathauer, assistant administrator for research and
development, said it will be several weeks before some remaining
questions about the experiment will be resolved.

   For 24 hours this week, Batman must have
hoped no menaces threatened the good citizens of Gotham City.
   Otherwise, he would have had to answer the call of duty in his
Batbriefs.
   On Thursday, some dastardly bad-guy entered the Please Touch
Museum for children in Philadelphia and stole Batman's costume _ the
original one worn by Adam West during the 1960s hit television
series. Detectives said the costume is valued at $50,000.
   But evil never triumphs over superheroes.
   About 3 p.m. Friday, police in suburban Upper Dublin Township
stopped a vehicle with the undamaged costume in its trunk. An
anonymous tip led authorities to the car.
   Philadelphia police Sgt. Edward Geigert said the driver,
19-year-old John Spitalik of Blairsville was charged with receiving
stolen property. Other charges are pending, Geigert said.
   Spitalik told police he didn't steal the costume, he bought it.
   From some Joker, no doubt.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You've heard of the Silent Majority. Meet the
Sedentary Majority.
   A decade ago, the government hoped Americans would be in better
shape by now. But federal health officials report at least five of
the 11 physical fitness goals they set for U.S. adults aren't going
to be met.
   Despite Jane Fonda video workouts, chic outfits and the
widespread thinking that thin is always in, only 8 percent of the
country's adults participate ``regularly'' in ``vigorous'' exercise,
defined by the national Centers for Disease Control as 20 minutes of
exercise at least three times a week.
   ``Evidence indicates that regular physical activity reduces the
incidence of ... many medical conditions,'' including heart disease,
colon cancer, diabetes and obesity, the CDC said in its weekly
report.
   In 1980, when the CDC published its goals for 1990, it hoped that
60 percent of Americans age 18-65 would get such regular exercise.
   But ``objectives for participation in regular physical activity
will not be fully met,'' the agency said.
   Officials, impressed by the lack of enthusiasm for hard exercise,
said their goals for 2000 are likely to be less arduous.
   Some of the other ``Objectives for the Nation'' published in
1980, and the likelihood of reaching the goals by next year:
   _Half of Americans 65 and older should walk, swim or engage in
other ``appropriate'' aerobic exercise at least three times a week.
Not likely; a 1985 survey showed that although 46 percent of older
Americans said they walked for exercise, just 8 percent met the
three-times-a-week, 20-minute level.
   _More than 90 percent of youngsters 10-17 should participate
three times a week in 20-minute sessions of vigorous exercise. Not
likely; a 1984 survey found only 66 percent of children exercised at
that level.
   _More than 60 percent of children 10-17 should participate in
daily school physical education programs. Not likely; a 1984 survey
placed the figure at 36 percent, only up by 3 percent from a 1974
survey.
   _More than 70 percent of U.S. adults should know that
cardiovascular health is best promoted by exercising at least three
times a week, for 20 minutes or more, and at a level that makes
heart rate and breathing ``a lot faster,'' but not so much that
talking is impossible. Not likely; a 1985 survey found that fewer
than 40 percent got those questions right.
   ``There are a number of avenues of research attempting to get at
the answers ... why exercisers exercise and why non-exercisers
don't,'' said Dr. Gregory W. Heath, a CDC researcher.
   Among the reasons being studied, he said, are ignorance of
exercise's benefits, poor access to exercise opportunities and
simple attitudes against it.
   Heath noted that exercise at lower levels of intensity, while not
matching the official fitness goals, still ``can convey not only
some fitness benefit, but some health benefit.''
   He said the goals for 2000 _ now in the works _ may allow for
people wanting a little less vigorous exercise.
   Only one of the 11 goals for 1990 was deemed likely to be met:
having more than 25 percent of large companies offer some kind of
fitness program. A 1985 survey found that 32 percent of worksites
with 250-749 employees, and 54 percent of those with 750 or more,
offered fitness programs.
   Other goals involved more technical matters of health services
and fitness evaluation techniques.

<TEXT>
   The Office of Management and Budget wants all
Cabinet departments and two major agencies to report on what they're
doing to fight fraud and abuse.
   An OMB memorandum to the 14 departments, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency on
June 27 asked for reports by July 23, OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay
said Friday.
   The memo from Budget Director Richard Darman was issued as
reports of wide-ranging fraud, mismanagement and abuse at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development mounted. It was
disclosed in today's editions of The Washington Post.
   ``I wouldn't want you to look at this as arising from the
troubles at HUD,'' said Clay.
   ``I would call it a concern that recommendations made by the
government's own inspectors, the inspectors general, might not be
being followed up,'' she said.
   The HUD inspector general told a congressional hearing on June 30
that on five occasions Congress and the department ignored his
warnings. The inspector general, Paul A. Adams, said the warnings
began in 1985.

<HEAD>Neptune's Third Moon Discovered By Approaching Voyager 2 Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seeking new worlds 2.75 billion miles
from Earth, NASA'S Voyager 2 spacecraft discovered a third moon
orbiting Neptune and is likely to find many more, scientists say.
   ``It's nice, after years of preparation for the Neptune
encounter, to have Voyager now starting to make these discoveries,''
Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomer Steve Synnott said Friday.
``Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the time this discovery process
is frustration, so it is finally nice to dig a nugget out of all the
mud.''
   Synnott detected the moon, temporarily designated 1989 N1, in
photographs taken by one of the space probe's television cameras.
Previously, only two moons had been detected from earth.
   Project scientist Ellis Miner said recently that Voyager might
discover at least 10 small moons orbiting Neptune.
   Voyagers 1 and 2 _ with total mission costs of $865 million _ now
have discovered at least 18 moons: three at Jupiter, at least four
and possibly seven at Saturn, 10 orbiting Uranus, and one so far at
Neptune.
   That boosts the total lunar count to 16 for Jupiter, at least 17
for Saturn, 15 for Uranus and three for Neptune.
   Synnott, who helped discover several of those moons, was asked
how he celebrates when he finds an entire new world.
   ``I usually go home and have a beer,'' he said.
   The Jet Propulsion laboratory operates America's unmanned space
exploration program for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Voyager 2 was launched from Florida in 1977, explored Jupiter in
1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Today it was 2.67 billion
miles from Earth and 42.8 million miles from Neptune, speeding at
42,200 mph toward its Aug. 24 close encounter with the solar
system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager will be 2.75 billion miles from Earth when it sweeps
3,000 miles above Neptune's north pole cloudtops at midnight EDT
Aug. 24, but its curving path to Neptune will equal 4.43 billion
miles.
   Neptune's other moons are Nereid and the backward-orbiting
Triton, discovered through telescopes on Earth in 1949 and 1846,
respectively.
   In 1981, scientists using telescopes believed they detected
another Neptunian moon, but its existence hasn't yet been confirmed
by Voyager.
   With a diameter estimated at 125 to 400 miles, 1989 N1 is smaller
than Nereid _ estimated at 190 to 620 miles across _ or Triton, with
an estimated diameter of 1,400 to 2,240 miles, or roughly the size
of Earth's moon.
   Synnott first detected the moon as a smudge in images taken by
Voyager 2 on June 21. He confirmed the discovery Wednesday by
examining images.
   ``I never really jumped and screamed, but I clenched my fist,
nodded my head to myself and said, `Yup, that one's real!''' he said.

<HEAD>Man Who's Been In Louisiana Prison Longest Getting Out</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Louisiana's longest-held inmate welcomed his
parole and said 41 years in prison had made him a different man.
   ``I learned to pick my people and stay out of trouble,'' James
``Black Mattie'' Robertson said. ``I'm a church-going man now. I
want to go out and be a good citizen now.''
   Robertson will leave the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola
on Monday, corrections officials said.
   ``All factors indicate that he is no longer a danger to
society,'' the state Parole Board said in granting Robertson parole
on Friday.
   The 67-year-old prisoner has been in the prison since 1948,
serving a life sentence for raping the wife of a sawmill worker in
rural Tensas Parish.
   He was turned down for parole in March 1988. When he reapplied
this year, the parole board ordered psychological testing before
considering his application.
   ``I never got discouraged,'' he said in a telephone interview
after hearing the news. ``When they turned me down that first time
they said I hadn't given them enough time. They said, `Give us some
more.' So I did.''
   The parole board assigned him to a halfway house in Baton Rouge
for six months where he will receive counseling to help him adjust
to a life of freedom.
   Robert Steele Sr., a businessman in a New Orleans suburb, has
promised him a job and place to live.
   ``He's welcome here. He's a fine man. I got to know him about a
year ago and I can tell you he should have been out of prison a long
time ago,'' Steele said.
   ``I'm kind of nervous from being in here so long, but there's a
lot I want to do. I want to see my boy and my grandchildren. I've
got their pictures, but I've never seen them,'' Robertson said.
   He said he hasn't seen his son Robert, who lives in Ferriday, for
10 or 15 years, although they have stayed in touch.
   Robertson's prison job is to keep clean the sidewalks around the
administration buildings of the sprawling prison. But for most of
his prison years he worked the farmland that covers Angola's fields,
which is how he got his nickname.
   Inmates and guards called the old train that once hauled sugar
cane out of the prison ``Mattie,'' Robertson said. The guards said
Robertson worked as hard as the train so they started calling him
Mattie, too.
   ``I used to holler just like that train. That's what I did again
today when they told me I was going to leave here. I hollered real
loud. Now this Mattie is pulling out of here and he won't be back.''

   Former White House aide Oliver North, spared
prison when he was sentenced this week on charges stemming from the
Iran-Contra affair, isn't relying on a possible presidential pardon.
   ``I don't think much about that. We're going to press the appeal,
and I'm confident in the outcome,'' North said at a closed
fund-raising session in Tampa Friday.
   And in his first public appearance since being sentenced
Wednesday, North also spoke to about 400 young Republicans in
Orlando.
   He told them he would not rule out a run for Congress, though he
acknowledged his conviction on felony counts prevents his holding
federal office.
   North said he first has to overcome ``tremendous legal problems''
from the scandal, adding that he had other worries as well.
   ``I deeply believe my first responsiblity is to my family, which
is still at risk from Abu Nidal and the Arab terrorists and the
Libyans, both of whom have offered to take me out,'' he told members
of the College Republicans National Committee.
   North, 45, received a three-year suspended sentence, was fined
$150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service for
his role in the Reagan administration's secret scheme to arm the
Contras. He will spend two years on probation.
   Asked if he would have done anything differently in helping the
Contras, North said:
   ``I deeply believe many people could have done much more to
explain the cause of Nicaraguan resistance so that we wouldn't have
had the on-again, off-again, up-again, down-again situation in
Washington that has been so despicable to those people.''
   North was received warmly.
   ``He did absolutely nothing with any criminal intent,'' said
Susan Brackin, the Republican group's executive director. ``Of
course we're very, very relieved that Col. North will not be
spending any time in jail.
   ``It would be a complete disgrace for what we consider a national
hero to have to spend time in prison.''
   But a group of protesters from the Central Florida Coalition for
Peace marched outside the Orlando hotel where North spoke.
   ``We were very upset when we heard Oliver North would not be
receiving any serious sentence after being found guilty ... on
felony counts of lying to Congress and basically subverting the
United States Constitution,'' coalition head Bruce Gagnon said.
   North was convicted May 4 of obstructing a congressional
investigation, destroying documents and illegally accepting a
gratuity. He was acquitted on nine other charges.

<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities today ordered the expulsion of
another American reporter, the fourth U.S. journalist told to leave
the country since last month.
   Mark Hopkins, correspondent for the U.S. government-run Voice of
America radio network, was given 72 hours to leave China, VOA
Director Richard W. Carlson said in a telephone interview from
Washington.
   Hopkins was the second VOA reporter ordered out of the country
since the bloody June 3-4 military crackdown against pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing. A total of seven foreign journalists have
been ordered expelled from China.
   Hopkins, 58, was called in this morning to the Beijing State
Security Bureau and accused of breaking martial law, instigating
propaganda, and violating the terms of his tourist visa, Carlson
said.
   ``We reject all the allegations,'' Carlson said. ``They're mad at
the messenger.''
   VOA Beijing Bureau Chief Alan Pessin was given three days to
leave China June 14. He was accused of spreading rumors and
anti-Chinese propaganda and violating martial law, which virtually
prohibits news reporting in Beijing.
   John Pomfret, a Beijing-based correspondent from The Associated
Press, has also been expelled, as has Joseph Kahn, a reporter for
the Dallas Morning News.
   Hopkins, a former VOA bureau chief in Beijing, works in the
shortwave radio network's bureau in Boston. He has been on temporary
assignment in China since June 10.
   VOA broadcasts in Chinese and English to the Chinese mainland. It
estimates its listening audience in the tens of millions.
   However, Carlson said Chinese authorities have been jamming VOA
broadcasts into China since May 21.
   Now, Carlson said, ``They're trying to jam us intellectually
too.''
   Pessin and Pomfret were ordered out of China together. They were
the only two resident correspondents who were expelled.
   Three correspondents for Britain's Independent Television Network
and a Kahn, a part-time writer for the Morning News, were on tourist
visas and ordered to leave China last month.
   The Chinese press meanwhile today reported investigations into
several major corruption cases, keeping up the publicity around its
drive to root out profiteering, swindling and bribery.
   ``Down with corruption'' was one of the main rallying cries in
April and May of the pro-democracy movement for a freer society and
a cleaner government.
   Since Chinese troops used arms and tanks to put down the
uprising, the government has gone to great lengths to demonstrate
that it takes the anti-corruption call to heart. At least 300 people
died in the crackdown.
   Ten major cases of profiteering involving municipal and local
companies are being investigated in Shanghai, China's largest city
and main industrial base, the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily said.
   The firms engaged in profiteering by reselling duty-free
materials, cars, houses, color television sets and refrigerators,
the paper said.
   The People's Daily also reported today that a swindler in rural
Shanxi province who defrauded business firms of $6.75 million was
sentenced to life in prison.
   Pei Wenzhong, chairman and general manager of the Luliang Iron
and Steel Co. and three rural factories, signed bogus contracts for
sale of fertilizer and steel with 10 companies, the paper said. He
also bribed a local policeman with $2,430, it said.
   China wound up meetings this week of its National People's
Congress, the legislature and the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, a high-level advisory group.
   Former Chinese President Li Xiannian, chairman of the advisory
group, told delegates this week that among ousted Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang's mistakes was ``casting aside the basic
principles of Mao Tse-tung thought,'' according to newspaper reports
today.
   Li also accused Zhao of not applying the basic tenets of Marxism,
an error he said would take a long period of education and struggle
to eliminate, the reports said.
   Zhao, stripped of his party and government posts following the
suppression of the uprising, was accused of splitting the party,
supporting the demonstrators and fostering the political atmosphere
that originally spawned the protests.
   The charge that he spurned Mao Tse-tung thought came as a newly
published book, ``The Life of Mao Tse-tung'' received widespread
acclaim.
   Hundreds of newspapers and periodicals in China have serialized
it or carried reviews, and 250,000 volumes have been sold, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   It said author Quan Yanchi traveled thousands of miles
interviewing soldiers, doctors and housemaids who once worked for
the revolutionary leader and founder of communist China.

<HEAD>Bush a Big Improvement Over Reagan, NAACP Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is more sensitive to black concerns
than his predecessor, but the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme
Court will continue to erode minority rights, NAACP leader Benjamin
Hooks said.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group with 500,000
members, predicts 18,000 to 20,000 people will attend its 80th
annual convention that opens Sunday in Detroit.
   A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions narrowing federal civil
rights laws and allowing white workers the right to countersue in
affirmative action cases will be a hot convention topic, Hooks said
at a news briefing Friday.
   ``The question on the minds of black folks around the country is
how we deal with the recent spate of Supreme Court decisions that
just emasculate the civil rights laws,'' the NAACP executive
director said. ``In fact, it's going to get a lot worse before it
gets better.''
   A side effect of the Supreme Court's rulings has been interest in
the NAACP from people who weren't involved before.
   ``I've seen young blacks in professional roles who haven't
supported us sending checks and wanting to demonstrate,'' Hooks said.
   While the high court is shutting the door on blacks, the
president seems willing to open them, Hooks said.
   Bush, unlike Ronald Reagan, has shown a genuine desire to see the
United States overcome its history of racism, Hooks said.
   ``There's no question in my mind that Bush is going to be a
better president than Reagan,'' he said. ``It would be hard to be a
worse president than Reagan.''
   Hooks said Bush, unlike Reagan, has been accessible to black
leaders and has met with him and the Congressional Black Caucus, as
well as with South African anti-apartheid leaders, the Revs. Desmond
Tutu and Allan Boesek.
   Hooks said he has known Bush for many years and considers him the
heir to the Republican Party's Eastern, more moderate wing.
   ``He wants to do a good job, but he wants to be elected again,''
Hooks said. ``There are various pressures working on him.''
   Overall, despite progress toward racial equality, the NAACP today
faces many of the same tasks it had 80 years ago, said Hooks, a
former Federal Communications Commission member who became NAACP
executive director in 1977.
   ``It's a sad fact that we're still about the same thing we were
when we were founded in 1909 _ eliminating all forms of racial
discrimination,'' he said. ``Racism, sexism are alive and well.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, 1988 Democratic presidential contender
Jesse Jackson and U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp are among those scheduled to address the NAACP convention,
which runs through Thursday.
   Asked how delegates would receive Quayle, who would be making his
first appearance before a black group, Hooks joked: ``Oh, he'll get
a reception. Seriously, he'll get a cordial reception, I'm sure. If
we didn't want to hear him, we wouldn't have invited him.''
   Other officials addressing the convention will be Democratic
National Committee Chairman Ron Brown, Gov. James Blanchard, Mayor
Coleman Young and United Auto Workers union President Owen Bieber.
   Filmmaker Spike Lee, whose movie ``Do the Right Thing'' has
sparked a debate over race relations, and TV talk show host Oprah
Winfrey also will appear.

<HEAD>Man Accused of Killing Snoring Hospital Roommate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINTHROP, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 43-year-old man has been accused of
killing his hospital roommate after complaining that the man's
snoring kept disturbing his sleep.
   William Fitzmeyer is accused of either beating or strangling
Thomas V. Fowler Jr., 76, Saturday in the room they shared at
Winthrop Community Hospital.
   Fowler died three days later and, according to Winthrop police
Lt. Angelo LaMonica, an autopsy showed the cause of death was
``blunt neck trauma.''
   LaMonica said he was unsure whether Fowler died of strangulation,
beating or a combination of both.
   Lt. Michael McManus said Fitzmeyer ``had complained to the nurses
a couple of times about the noises (Fowler) was making and the
noises he was referring to was a man snoring.''
   During the initial interviews of the investigation Fitzmeyer told
police Fowler's snoring was preventing him from sleeping, LaMonica
said. But LaMonica added that Fitzmeyer denied killing the elderly
man.
   Fitzmeyer was admitted to the hospital after suffering epileptic
seizures and placed in a room with Fowler about 2 a.m. Saturday,
LaMonica said. At about 4:45 a.m. nurses discovered Fowler, who had
been wearing an oxygen mask, had been beaten around the face and
neck and ``was bloodied up,'' said LaMonica.
   LaMonica said a cord from the oxygen mask was wrapped around
Fowler's neck.
   Fitzmeyer apparently had not been taking prescribed anti-seizure
medicine, LaMonica said. But hospital nurses told police that
Fitzmeyer, an unemployed former maintenance worker, showed no signs
of violent behavior Saturday morning.
   Hospital administrators did not return a phone call from The
Associated Press Friday.
   Winthrop police were called and within several hours they
arrested Fitzmeyer for assault with intent to murder and assault and
battery on a person older than 65. Because of Fowler's death three
days later, police said they plan to seek a murder charge.
   Fitzmeyer was released from the hospital Monday and taken to his
initial arraignment at East Boston District Court. He is being held
at the Charles Street Jail on $25,000 bail pending his second
arraignment.
   Fowler had been living in a nursing home prior to his hospital
admission.

<HEAD>Secretary Of State Baker Arrives in Oman for Stopover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
arrived today in this Arab sultantate from Brunei for a 36-hour
stopover en route to Poland to team up with President George Bush.
   U.S. Embassy officials described the visit to Oman as ``informal,
very much of a rest trip.'' But the brief contacts he will have are
considered significant in view of the close Omani-U.S. relations and
friendly relations between Oman and Iran.
   An embassy spokesman said there would be ``no substantive talks''
when Baker sees the Deputy Prime Minister for Defense, Fahr bin
Taymour, and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Yousef bin
Alawi.
   Oman, on the western side of the strategic Strait of Hormuz at
the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is the first Arab state
to be visited by Baker since he took office.
   The sultanate has become the Gulf region's most active
interlocutor with Tehran in the quest for regional stability and for
reconciliation following the end of the 8-year Iran-Iraq war last
August in a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire.
   Oman provides onshore facilities for U.S. Navy warships patroling
the Gulf and the Arabian Sea.
   Sultan Qaboos, the ruler of Oman, is abroad on an extended
European tour. In December he will take over the rotating
chairmanship of the 6-state Gulf Cooperation Council alliance that
includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.
   Baker will spend the afternoon sightseeing in an Arab souk, or
market. Before his departure Sunday morning, the government has
arranged for him to visit a military base outside Muscat.

   Thousands of firefighters battled forest and range blazes in
seven western states as they began a hot, dry weekend that promised
more of the same.
   In California, a brush fire whipped by hot winds burned out of
control 65 miles north of Sacramento late Friday, destroying four
homes. A day-care center was evacuated but the fire did not reach
the building.
   Some 600 firefighters managed to expand a containment line around
40 percent of a 3,000-acre fire in the Bridger-Teton National Forest
in Wyoming, but the high temperatures and wind threatened new
outbreaks, said forest spokesman Ed Christian.
   ``It's hotter than a $2 pistol in this room,'' Christian said in
a telephone interview from forest offices in Pinedale, near the
Idaho border.
   Four wildfires charred more than 16,000 acres in Utah, and
weekend forecasts for wind and lightning had authorities worried.
   ``We're just scared to death, to tell you the truth,'' said Ray
Tate of the Bureau of Land Management's Vernal, Utah, office.
   Firefighters brought 14 New Mexico blazes under control and hoped
to contain a 7,700-acre blaze in the Gila National Forest by Monday,
said spokesman Ron Henderson.
   ``It's not causing us any problems, but the potential is there if
we get bad weather,'' he said.
   About 800 people, aided by 10 helicopters and three air tankers,
battled the lightning-caused fire.
   Thirteen uncontrolled fires have seared brush and trees on more
than 25,000 acres of state and federal land in southeastern Arizona,
Gov. Rose Mofford said.
   She viewed more than a half-dozen fire sites for about 90 minutes
by airplane Friday.
   The fire threat is the worst faced in Arizona in at least 10
years because of extended 100-degree temperatures, low humidity and
drought conditions, said Bill Paleck, supervisor of the Saguaro
National Monument.
   ``There wasn't any snowpack to speak of in the mountains this
winter; there hasn't been much rainfall,'' Paleck said. ``As early
as mid-April of this year we had conditions as dry as June. There
hasn't been any substantial rain to relieve that condition.''
   In south-central Alaska, the Swinging Dome Fire about 200 miles
west of Anchorage grew to 11,000 acres and was fought by three
16-person crews, with another seven crews expected, state foresters
said.
   In California, the fire north of Sacramento scorched 750 acres of
brushland and was about half-contained by 11 p.m. PDT, said D.J.
Stephens, a forestry department spokeswoman.
   Another wind-driven blaze charred about 800 acres in Lassen
County, some 200 miles northeast of Sacramento on the eastern slopes
of the Sierra Nevada, authorities said. Most of the flames were on
private land.
   The fire engulfed two fire engines, and a firefighter was treated
at a hospital for smoke inhalation. Authorities closed a 12-mile
stretch of U.S. Route 395 between Milford and Janesville.
   Neither the Oroville nor the Lassen County fires were under
control early today. Temperatures in the region soared above 100
degrees Friday.
   In Washington, 1,500 acres of sagebrush and grass burned south of
Omak, about 235 miles east of Seattle. The fire was spread rapidly
by 20-25 mph winds, said Bill Wilburn, spokesman for the Department
of Natural Resources.
   Forest and range fires also were reported in Colorado and Georgia.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Parade Expensive Shops Owners To Stand In PTL Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors in the tax evasion trial of
James and David Taggart have summoned the operators of some of the
East Coast's most exclusive shops to testify about purchases made by
the former PTL aides.
   Cartier Inc. representative Gary Saage Jr. told jurors Friday
that David Taggart bought several expensive items at the company's
New York flagship store, including an $85,000 diamond and sapphire
pin, and witnesses from other expensive shops, including Gucci,
testified about other items including a $10,000 Rolex watch.
   The Taggarts are charged with failing to pay $487,000 in income
taxes from 1984 to 1987. Federal prosecutors say they diverted $1.1
million of ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash
advances on PTL credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay
the credit card bills.
   All of the witnesses testified that their shops catered to the
wealthiest U.S. consumers.
   ``A person who shops in our store sort of doesn't ask the
price,'' said Frederick Bodner, who described the Taggarts as
regular customers at his exclusive clothing shop in Palm Beach, Fla.
   In other testimony, the former executive secretary to PTL founder
Jim Bakker said she once forged Bakker's signature, at the direction
of David Taggart, on a memo that turned a $45,000 loan into a
$45,000 bonus.
   Shirley Fulbright said the memo gave her a $90,000 bonus, $45,000
of which was used to pay off the loan.
   David Taggart had used a similar forged memo for loans of his
own, she said.
   Earlier Friday, a tax attorney testified that missing records and
huge salaries paid to PTL leaders made it difficult for him to
defend the ministry's tax-exempt status in the face of Internal
Revenue Service questioning.
   ``I felt their tax exemption was in jeopardy,'' Michael Wigton
testified. ``I felt they needed to have some effective answers.''
   He said one of his biggest concerns was excessive compensation.
   ``The distinction is when insiders or controlling parties used
their power to use non-exempt money for their own purposes,'' he
said.
   Wigton, a former IRS specialist in exempt organizations who is
now in private practice, was retained by PTL in late 1985 to fight
the IRS's proposed revocation of PTL's tax-exempt status.
   The IRS action stemmed from an audit of PTL for the years
1981-1983.
   Wigton testified under questioning by prosecutor David Brown that
he was unable to obtain documents on credit card cash advances and
American Express charges that dealt specifically with David Taggart.
   He described one incident in which he was unable to get American
Express receipts. A set of copies he requested from the credit card
company was lost at PTL, he said. A second set of copies also was
reported lost by PTL officials, he said.
   ``They just disappeared,'' said Wigton.
   Most of the missing records had to do with travel expenses and
other charges incurred by David Taggart, he said.

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers have called a
three-day memorial to cool passions raised by a long strike, but
union officials can't guarantee that wildcat strikers will return to
the mines after the holiday.
   ``They've looked to the government for a solution to their
problems and see people hauled off and carted off to jail,'' said
John Duray, a spokesman for the UMW in Washington, D.C.
   More than 37,000 miners were on wildcat walkouts in eight states
Friday, protesting The Pittston Co.'s refusal to sign a national
contract with 1,800 miners in West Virginia. The walkouts began June
12.
   They also were incited by millions of dollars in fines levied
against the union by judges and the arrests of strike leaders and
supporters.
   ``There's a whole lot of talk about law, but there's not any
justice,'' Duray said. ``The system's broken down.''
   Violence has increased with the miners' frustration, Duray said,
prompting UMW President Richard Trumka's call Friday for a three-day
memorial period beginning Monday.
   It was the first official union sanction for wildcat action,
which judges around the country have been declaring illegal. But
Trumka said his objectives were anything but provocative.
   ``The union is calling this memorial period in an attempt to calm
the volatile situation in the coal fields,'' he said in a statement
released by the union. ``Although the union has requested that they
return to work, the conditions which led to the protest ... remain
unchanged.''
   All UMW members east of the Mississippi River will be asked to
stay away from work Monday through Wednesday, except those at
Westmoreland Coal Co. The union used memorial days for Westmoreland
workers in Virginia in April.
   Duray said he didn't expect a settlement with Pittston by
Wednesday and couldn't predict whether the miners would return to
work.
   Most of the nation's mines have been closed for two weeks in a
national vacation period and were scheduled to restart midnight
Sunday. It was unclear how the memorial wildcat action would affect
the reopenings.
   Bituminous Coal Operators Association spokesman Morris Feibusch
refused to comment on Trumka's call.
   About 2,000 striking miners surrounded a meeting hall in Beckley,
55 miles southeast of Charleston on Friday to protest the firing of
28 colleagues _ the first union men fired since the start of the
wildcat strikes. The protestors prevented a hearing between union
officials and the Toney's Branch Coal Co.
   ``I think that's only going to worsen the situation,'' Democratic
Rep. Bob Wise said of the firings. ``Once you get the genie out of
the bottle, it's going to be hard to get it back in.''
   Wildcat strikes have spread through the Appalachian and
Midwestern coal fields in apparent violation of the UMW's national
contract with the BCOA.
   The National Labor Relations Board on Friday asked a federal
judge in Alton, Ill., to order 8,500 coal miners in Illinois to end
their wildcat strike and return to work.
   The NLRB cited the union for violations at some mining operations
in West Virginia, saying its members were using ``violence, threats
and intimidation.''
   The board also said it planned court action to force miners back
to work at two coal mines in Indiana.
   Pittston workers mined coal for more than 14 months without a
contract before walking out April 5, refusing a company request that
miners work mandatory overtime and on Sundays and refusing proposed
cuts in medical benefits for pensioners.

   Thousands of commuters were trapped in a
sweltering subway tunnel when a passenger pulled an emergency cord
on a jammed commuter train, and 32 people were treated for heat
exhaustion and other injuries.
   The pull of the cord brought the train to an abrupt halt as it
approached a station in the Queens borough Friday evening, and two
other trains also stopped, stranding more than 2,500 people
underground.
   It took rescuers more than 2{ hours to evacuate the trains.
   ``We saw people collapsing. Some of them collapsed right in front
of us,'' said Fire Department Lt. John B. Harden. ``There were quite
a few people sprawled on the platform.''
   The person who pulled the cord was not found, said Termaine
Garden, a Transit Authority spokesman.
   When the motorman reset the cord, the train ``would not take
power,'' he said.
   After a few minutes without power or air conditioning, ``some
passengers on board started climbing down between the cars to the
tracks,'' Garden said. Police were called in to help evacuate the
trains.
   Capt. Robert A. Hannafey of the Emergency Medical Services said
none of the injuries were life-threatening.
   Ten people were treated at the scene and 22 others were taken to
area hospitals suffering from the heat and ``minor bumps and
bruises,'' he said.
   Service on the subway line was restored about three hours after
the incident.
   Garden said the tunnels were ``very humid, very hot'' and the
temperature may have been as high as 100 degrees.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact
allies today signed an agreement to seek a nuclear-free Europe with
significantly fewer soldiers and arms, the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported.
   The document calls for ``a stable and secure Europe, free from
nuclear and chemical weapons, for substantial cuts in armed forces,
arms and military spending,'' Tass said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the red-covered text
of the 16-page accord with a flourish and a smile for photographers,
who were allowed to attend a brief signing ceremony. The signing
took place in a marble-columned hall in Bucharest's former royal
palace.
   In remarks Friday at a palace dinner for the East bloc's top
Communist Party and government officials, Gorbachev said the
documents adopted by the Pact in the two-day annual summit contain a
``serious palpable answer to the proposals made by the NATO
countries.''
   President Bush on May 29 called for cuts in U.S. and Soviet
troops to 275,000 soldiers each stationed in Europe outside of the
Soviet Union, and for reductions in weapons and combat aircraft.
   ``We took new steps today toward European security and
rapprochement and East-West dialogue,'' Gorbachev said.
   East German leader Erich Honecker meanwhile flew home early this
morning suffering from an illness that was serious enough for him to
miss the signing ceremony with his Warsaw Pact collegues.
   The 76-year-old leader's illness was variously described as a
gallbladder ailment by the East German news agency ADN, as ``acute
biliary trouble'' by the Romanian news agency Agerpres and as a
kidney problem by Roman officials and East German journalists in
Bucharest. Bile ducts carry digestive fluids from the liver or
gallbladder to the intestinal system.
   Gorbachev expressed the hope that the new East Bloc agreement
will allow the two military alliances in Europe to rapidly and
successfully complete negotiations for arms reductions.
   ``I think one could say that, owing to our comradely talks today,
one more serious step was taken offering prerequisites to the
further progress of the all-European process,'' Gorbachev said at
the dinner.
   Details of the documents were to be released later today.
   The Soviet leader said the pact's ``important resolution'' will
help narrow the gap between NATO and the East bloc and bring success
at the Vienna negotiations on a reduction of conventional weaponry
in Europe.
   Gorbachev's host, Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, told the
dinner the Warsaw Pact declaration expresses the East bloc's
determination ``for the conventional arms redutions talks in Vienna
to end with best possible results and in the shortest possible
time.''
   Ceausescu renewed what he termed the Soviet bloc's ``appeal to
NATO to give up its policy of nuclear deterrence'' and expressed
hope that new steps by the East bloc would draw a favorable response
from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Gorbachev said that, if Moscow's allies agreed, the Kremlin would
be ready to make further unilateral cuts in its European nuclear
arsenal once NATO agrees to talks on reducing short-range missiles.
   Earlier in the week while in France, Gorbachev assured East bloc
allies that each is free to find its own way to socialism.
   ``Each country and each party has its own specifics and can
continue its own individual road to socialist democracy and
progress,'' he said.
   Gorbachev added, however, that he hoped perestroika, the social
and economic reforms he has championed in the Soviet Union, would
serve as a model.
   Officials at the talks refused to comment on whether the
discussion involved friction between reform-oriented leaders in
Hungary, Poland, and the Soviet Union and their more orthodox
counterparts elsewhere in the bloc.

<TEXT>
   An appeal hearing for a confessed North
Korea agent opened today with prosecutors demanding that she be
hanged for blowing up a South Korean airliner and killing 115 people
aboard.
   The prosecution asked the court to reject appeals of the agent,
Kim Hyon Hui, and uphold the lower court's verdict. ``Nothing can
extenuate her guilt,'' it said.
   She was sentenced to death April 25 by a lower court on charges
of violating national security and aviation laws.
   Several hundred security agents and police guarded the Seoul
Appellate Court today as the 27-year-old defendant was escorted into
the courthouse.
   As in earlier hearings, she admitted all charges and denounced
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung and his son and heir apparent, Kim
Jong Il. She said they ordered her to carry out the attack.
   After receiving the appeal, the appellate court adjourned for
later hearings.
   She has said she blew up the plane to disrupt last summer's
Olympic Games in Seoul. North Korea has denied involvement, claiming
South Korea engineered the attack to embarrass the communist north.
   The plane disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, as it approached the Burmese
coast on a flight from Baghdad, Iraq, to Seoul.

   A bull in the annual running of the bulls
today gored the face of one man, and police said 41 other people
were also injured during the race made famous by Ernest Hemingway.
   The weeklong San Fermin Festival opened Friday. Each day of the
event, a group of bulls chase revelers a half-mile through this
northern city's old quarter to the bull ring.
   Today, the run took two minutes, 37 seconds. An estimated 1,000
people scrambled ahead of the bulls.
   One of the bulls seriously injured Luis Sanchez Becerro, 33, of
Pamplona, by goring him in the right cheek, Navarre Hospital
spokesman Manuel Garcia said.
   Sanchez Becerro underwent surgery and remained in serious
condition, the doctor said.
   He also said 52-year-old Jose Loza Penafiel of Irun, Spain,
suffered a broken ankle when a bull trampled him.
   The rest of the injured were treated for bruises and scrapes at
Red Cross posts along the route, the Red Cross said.
   The festival is held annually in July to honor San Fermin,
Pamplona's patron saint. Hemingway's 1926 novel, ``The Sun Also
Rises,'' memorialized the race.
   Since the festival was first held in 1591, bulls have gored 52
people to death, 13 of them since 1924, according to city records.

   Light rain doused much of the East early today while a heat wave
continued to parch the West.
   Storms hit several Eastern states with hail and strong winds.
One-inch diameter hail fell at Newbury, N.H., and golf ball-size
hail pelted Geistown, Pa.
   Storm winds caused damage in parts of New Hampshire, southeast
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Winds gusted to between 80
and 100 mph at Sunapee, N.H., causing damage to homes and trees, and
gusts of 61 mph were recorded at Nashua, N.H.
   Downed trees blocked roads and cut power in parts of southwest
Pennsylvania, and a couple was in fair condition in a hospital after
being struck by lightning while fishing at a state park near
Johnstown.
   Rain and thunderstorms were continuing this morning from southern
New England across much of the Middle Atlantic States, northern
parts of Virginia and West Virginia, southern Ohio, the coast of the
Carolinas, southern parts of the central Gulf Coast, central Texas,
central Arizona and the Dakotas.
   Golf ball-size hail also fell at Grand Rapids and La Moure, N.D.
   Little relief was in sight today from the heat wave that has
gripped much of the Central and Western states. Highs were forecast
to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal from the upper Mississippi
Valley across the Rockies to much of Utah and Nevada.
   High temperature records were broken or tied Friday in at least
24 cities in 10 states from Missouri to California.
   In Utah, Cedar City and Moab set new all-time highs with readings
of 105 and 114 degrees, respectively. Moab's high broke by one
degree a mark that had stood since 1936.
   In Colorado, Alamosa and Grand Junction set record highs for the
fourth straight day with readings of 91 and 103, respectively.
   In California, Sacramento's high of 110 broke the previous record
of 107 set in 1905. Other record highs included 114 degrees in Las
Vegas, 108 in Casper, Wyo., 102 in Denver, and 101 in St. Joseph, Mo.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from central Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast, and scattered
thunderstorms across the upper Mississippi Valley and western
Michigan, as well as Arizona. Light rain was expected along the
coast of Washington state. Skies were predicted to be generally
sunny over the remainder of the nation.
   Highs generally were expected to be in the upper 80s or 90s,
except for 60s or 70s along much of the Pacific Coast, 70s from the
lower Great Lakes through New England, about 100 degrees in the
northern and central Plains, the central Rockies, much of Utah and
Nevada and the interior valleys of California, and near 110 degrees
in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45 degrees at Houlton,
Maine, to 100 at Las Vegas.

<HEAD>Zulu Leader Says United Black Action is Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival black factions that have
sometimes battled each other are working on a plan for unified
action to end apartheid, a Zulu leader said.
   ``I can well see future historians tracing a whole new political
era _ and in fact the final collapse of apartheid _ to this very
document and to the united action that it made possible,'' said Zulu
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi late Friday.
   He made the comments in a statement released in advance of
today's meeting of his political organization, Inkatha.
   Buthelezi declined to provide details of the plan. He said it
would be discussed at a meeting of the African National Congress,
United Democratic Front and Inkatha. However, he gave no date.
   The plan was drafted last month at a meeting in Durban of
delegates from Inkatha, the front, and the Congress of South African
Trade Unions.
   Inkatha backers have been battling supporters of an alliance of
the two other groups for three years in Natal province in feuds and
revenge attacks that have killed about 2,000 people.
   In early June, the three groups opened peace talks, and violence
has decreased sharply since then.
   The outlawed ANC, the leading anti-apartheid group, is not part
of the talks. But its views are represented in them by delegates of
the front.
   The front, the union group and the ANC have in the past called
Buthelezi a collaborator with the apartheid system of racial
discrimination because of his position as chief minister of the Zulu
homeland and his opposition to tactics such as strikes, boycotts,
and other sanctions.
   He says these measures harm blacks more than the government.
Buthelezi, a member of the ANC in his youth, also believes the ANC's
bomb attacks and its claim to be the sole representative of South
Africa's blacks have hindered united black action.
   However, the Zulu leader said he now has high hopes for an
agreement. ``We could well be entering into an era in which black
politics is given a completely different face,'' he said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A fired Coca-Cola driver who killed two of
his superiors and holed up in the company's office for seven hours
emerged this morning firing his guns and was fatally shot by police,
authorities said.
   John Wallace, 45, seized and released a hostage after shooting
the two men, who allegedly had fired him earlier Friday night, then
blockaded himself in the Coca-Cola West Metro Sales Center, said
Cobb County Police Chief Culver Johnson.
   He negotiated with police in this northern Atlanta suburb for
most of the night.
   Around 5 a.m. police fired tear gas into the building, a
distribution and sales office, and Wallace agreed to come out
without his guns, Johnson said.
   Instead, Wallace emerged with two guns and fired at police, he
said.
   ``They had no choice but to return the fire,'' Johnson said.
   Wallace was taken to Cobb General Hospital, where nursing
supervisor Linda Cole later said Wallace had died.
   Johnson said Wallace came to work at the plant near the Six Flags
Over Georgia amusement park around 10 p.m. and was told of his
dismissal. The reason for his firing was not immediately known.
   Witnesses told police that Wallace then went to clean out his
locker but returned with a handgun and fired on a gathering of
workers, shooting two of them.
   A caller who identified himself as Wallace telephoned WSB-TV in
Atlanta and told reporters he had shot two men. Police said
officials at the station acted as negotiators by telephone until
police took over.
   David Kenney, an associate producer at WSB, said the caller
described having worked 23 years for the company and said he shot
the plant manager who fired him and his supervisor.
   The victims were removed from the building within about an hour
of the shooting. One died at the scene and the other died later at a
hospital. One of the men was identified as Al Parsons, but his age
and hometown were not known.
   Police said Wallace took another man hostage for more than an
hour after the shootings, then released him.
   Police said two other employees who were in the building managed
to escape.

<HEAD>Fighting Continues In Lebanon, Despite Peace Initiative</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem gunmen battled in the
streets of west Beirut today, and Syrian and Christian troops traded
artillery fire across the city's Green Line. Six people were
reported killed and 28 wounded.
   The bloodshed undermined a new Arab League peace initative aimed
at ending the civil war's latest round of fighting, which began four
months ago.
   A Syrian-backed Moslem militia said Friday that it is seeking
surface-to-surface missiles to counter the Christians' reported
acquisition of Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles from Iraq, Syria's
main Arab foe.
   With its 45-mile range, the Frog-7 could reach Syria's capital,
Damascus, if fired from the Christian-held sector of the central
mountains.
   The missile issue adds a new dimension to the 14-year-old civil
war by threatening to carry it beyond Lebanon's borders for the
first time.
   In today's clashes between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, three people were killed and
12 wounded, police said.
   The Shiite factions have been fighting for leadership of
Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's biggest sect. Their
battle broke out again eight days ago after a lull of several
months. Eight people have been killed and 28 wounded in the
inter-Shiite gunbattles since July 1.
   In the Syrian-Christian artillery duels across the
Moslem-Christian dividing line, three were killed and 16 wounded,
police said.
   Including the latest deaths, 408 people have been killed and
1,574 wounded since March 8 in fighting between Christian forces
loyal to army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian troops allied
with Moslem militiamen.
   Their latest battles began after Aoun's gunboats blockaded
illegal ports run by the Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut.
   Aoun, who also leads the Christian half of Lebanon's dual
government, has vowed to drive the Syrians from Lebanon. Syria keeps
about 40,000 troops here under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   Despite repeated Arab League efforts to end the bloodshed,
fighting escalated sharply this week after Syria demanded that Aoun
remove the Frog-7 missiles he has reportedly obtained from Iraq.
   Amal leader Nabih Berri, Syria's main ally in Lebanon, threatened
Friday to acquire Frog-7s as well.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the Arab League's assistant general secretary,
met with Aoun today seeking to ``work out a solution to the missile
issue,'' a source close to Aoun reported. The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Ibrahimi is proposing that a special security committee be
created to search ships heading to our ports to make sure they
aren't bringing in weapons. Syria accepts this proposal,'' the
source said.
   However, the source said Aoun believes such a ban should apply
only to militias, not army forces he commands.
   Syrian gunboats have been patrolling off the coast of the
besieged Christian enclave for a week in an effort to tighten a
blockade.

   Erich Honecker, East Germany's leader, returned
home early from a Warsaw Pact summit in Bucharest, Romania, because
of an ``acute gallbladder ailment,'' the state-run news agency ADN
said today.
   The brief report gave no other details about the condition of
Honecker, who will be 77 on Aug. 25, and did not say if he had been
hospitalized upon his return to East Berlin. ADN said Honecker was
seen off early today by Romanian Communist Party leader Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   The official Romanian news agency Agerpres described Honecker's
illness as ``acute biliary trouble.'' Romanian officials and East
German journalists in Bucharest said he was suffering from a kidney
problem. Bile ducts carry digestive fluids from the liver or
gallbladder to the intestinal system.
   Honecker missed the signing of a Warsaw Pact agreement to seek a
nuclear-free Europe with significantly fewer soldiers and arms.
   The document was signed for East Germany by Premier Willi Stoph.
   Honecker became Communist Party leader in 1971 and assumed the
additional post of head of state in 1976.
   He has resisted carrying out the type of political and economic
reforms introduced in the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.

   Southeast Asian nations today
said Cambodia's guerrilla factions should form an interim government
and hold elections under U.N. supervision after Vietnamese troops
withdraw.
   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, said the
coalition government should include the Khmer Rouge and should
invite an international peacekeeping force to Cambodia until
elections are held.
   The weeklong ASEAN conference, which ended today, also called for
a forum on economic cooperation in the Pacific basin.
   The foreign ministers said an international conference on
Cambodia that begins July 30 in Paris should strive for a
U.N.-supervised agreement after Vietnam makes good on its promise to
withdraw its troops by Sept. 30 from the country it invaded in late
1978.
   The communique was issued by the foreign ministers of ASEAN,
which includes Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and
the Philippines, at the close of talks this week in this South
Pacific nation. Also attending the talks, which began Monday, were
United States, Canada, New Zealand and Japan.
   France's Deputy Foreign Minister Edwige Avice said prospects for
success have been brightened by China's announcement it will attend
the conference. China arms the guerrillas against Soviet-armed
Vietnam.
   A senior ASEAN diplomat, who spoke anonymously, said President
Francois Mitterrand of France asked Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to exert influence on Vietnam to help ensure the success
of the conference.
   Cambodia said the ministers' wish to include the hard-line Khmer
Rouge in an interim government and introduce an international
peacekeeping force is against the spirit of peace talks in Jakarta
and agreements between Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen.
   ``The Cambodian government...vehemently condemns attempts at
encouraging the Khmer Rouge to take part in any future government of
Cambodia,'' said the official Cambodian News Agency report seen in
Bangkok today.
   Sihanouk heads a three-party coalition which includes the Khmer
Rouge and is fighting the government in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge
were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians during their 3{-year rule until they were ousted by the
Vietnamese invasion.
   At a concluding joint news conference today, Australian Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans rejected charges by the European Commission
that a new economic forum proposed by Canberra could turn into a
protectionist trading bloc.
   ``There is not a single country that is likely to join'' a forum
that is not committed to free trade, he said. He rejected the
European Commission's request to participate in the new forum.
   Evans said his government will invite 11 countries to an
exploratory meeting in Australia in November.

   A new furor broke out in Japan today over reports
the agriculture minister for the governing political party declared
that women are ``useless in the world of politics'' and should stay
home.
   The comments Friday by Hisao Horinouchi in a campaign speech for
fellow Liberal Democrats in western Mie Prefecture were bound to
compound the problems of Prime Minister Sousuke Uno. His popularity
has already suffered, especially among women, as a result of claims
he paid a geisha to be his mistress.
   Uno told reporters today he would seek an explanation from
Horinouchi for the remarks.
   In a televised news conference this evening, Horinouchi said he
was sorry.
   ``I deeply apologize for having made remarks that have bothered
so many women,'' he said. ``I would like to retract them
completely.''
   Major newspapers reported today that Horinouchi said in his
speech, ``In the end, women's task is to stay home and take care of
their families.''
   Horinouchi also called the female head of the Japan Socialist
Party, Takako Doi, ``an idiot,'' according to the newspapers.
   ``There is no female congresswoman in the United States,'' he
added. In fact, at least 25 members of the U.S. House of
Representatives are women.
   Horinouchi also reportedly said, ``England's Prime Minister
(Margaret) Thatcher is special, and she has a husband and children.
But Socialist Party chairman Ms. Doi is single, and we must not
allow such a person who has never had a family to be a head of the
state.''
   ``Can women be useful in the political world?'' he was quoted as
asking. ``Even if they advance (into Parliament), they can't work as
legislators.'' Several women represent the Liberal Democratic Party
in Japan's Parliament.
   ``Women are useless in the world of politics,'' Horinouchi was
quoted as saying.
   ``In the end, women's task is to stay home and take care of their
families,'' he said.
   Uno and his Liberal Democratic Party have been reeling from the
geisha scandal and other embarrassments. After the former geisha
said Uno paid her more than $21,400 to be his mistress for four
months, Uno was reported to be considering resigning. He denied the
reports, however.
   The governing party has also been plagued by an
influence-peddling scandal in which government leaders and their
aides purchased stock at bargain prices. Uno's predecessor, Noboru
Takeshita, resigned in the midst of that scandal on June 2.
   The party has also taken a beating over an unpopular 3 percent
sales tax instituted April 1.
   Horinouchi was campaigning for an election on July 23 for the
upper house of the national parliament. Analysts say the Liberal
Democrats, the majority party in Parliament for 34 years, could lose
their majority.
   In Tokyo municipal elections Sunday, the governing party lost 20
seats, while the Japan Socialist Party gained 17. The Liberal
Democrats now hold 43 seats, and the Japan Socialist Party has 29.
   In that vote, 17 women were elected, up from seven in the
previous election in 1985. Analysts pointed to a high turnout among
woman voters.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa defended Horinouchi to
reporters today, saying, ``He did not mean to look down upon
women,'' according to the Kyodo news agency.
   But party Secretary General Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news
conference the reported remarks were ``a slander to LDP female
candidates,'' Kyodo said. He added that Horinouchi should ``take
back his remarks if he really meant what he said,'' it reported.
   Horinouchi's remarks, published on the front pages today of the
Mainichi Shimbun and the Yomiuri Shimbun, two of the country's major
dailies, angered many women.
   One who answered the phone at the party's own election committee
told The Associated Press that Horinouchi's remarks were
``unpleasant and ridiculous.''
   ``Women are finally getting interested in and trying to
participate in politics,'' said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``So I resent any statement that interferes with the
trend.''
   Ms. Doi, on a campaign trip to Osaka, told Kyodo today that
Horinouchi's remarks only show how much his party is suffering.
   ``He still doesn't seem to realize that LDP politics are so
rotten women can't keep quiet any more,'' Kyodo quoted Ms. Doi as
saying.
   She said his remarks may further anger female voters over the
governing party, the agency said.

   President Bush said the United States
stands ready to support political and economic change in Eastern
Europe but is not going to tell the region how to go about it,
Hungarian news media reported today.
   ``It is not an American president's role to say to those in
another country, `You have to have your system this way, matching
our system, or else we can't do business with you,''' he was quoted
as saying.
   His comments came in a recent interview with Hungarian
journalists in Washington. Excerpts were released today by
government-run media in Budapest.
   Bush said changes taking place in Poland and Hungary will make it
``much easier for the United States to be a full partner in economic
development and economic reform,'' according to MTI, Hungary's
state-run news agency.
   Bush arrives in Poland on Sunday and travels to Budapest on
Tuesday.
   Bush was quoted as saying the visits are designed to ``salute''
political and economic reforms under way in Poland and Hungary.
   Asked if Hungary could expect increased economic aid, Bush said:
   ``I wish that I was going to be in a free-fall in terms of the
funds we could bring to bear on the problem. We aren't. But we will
try to have some ideas and some funds that can be helpful in some
way to Hungary.''
   He added: ``I'm going to be sure that your leaders know that
there are certain confines within which I have to operate.''
   He said members of Congress will ``want to be sure that economic
performance matches our expectations if we're going to give money or
other countries are going to give money.''
   But Bush pledged that to the ``degree change can accommodate
privatization or more market for us or more openness towards the
West, then we can do more.''
   Bush said economic aid to Poland and Hungary would be high on the
agenda when leaders of the world's most industrialized nations meet
in Paris for a summit next week.
   The president was quoted as saying that while there are
``exciting changes'' going on in Poland and Hungary, the United
States should not meddle in the domestic affairs of Warsaw Pact
nations. ``I think a country like the United States ought not to
over-promise, ought not to over-exhort for others to be like us and
thus make problems worse for the people.''
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party and opposition groups have
agreed to hold multiparty elections by next summer and the country
has embarked on market-orientated economic reforms, including more
cooperation with the West.
   But the country still suffers from a staggering foreign debt,
high inflation and erratic consumer supplies.
   Poland recently legalized Solidarity and held its freest
elections in more than 40 years. Solidarity-backed candidates won a
major role in the government.

   Protesters hurling plastic baby bottles on Saturday
burst into a square where U.S. Ambassador Walter Curley was speaking

   The protest disrupted a ceremony inaugurating the renovated

   About 100 demonstrators chanted ``Money for day care, not for the
bicentennial!'' France is celebrating the 200th anniversary of its
revolution.
   The protesters carried leaflets calling for a ``Declaration of
the Rights of Children to Day Care.'' Blocked by lines of police
officers, they chanted slogans while the U.S. and French national
anthems were played at the end of the ceremony.
   Besides Curley, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac also spoke at the
inauguration of the renovated park in the Place des Etats-Unis, in a
prosperous neighborhood just south of the Arc de Triomphe.

   Rival student groups fought gunbattles
Saturday at Karachi University, and at least four people, including
a police officer, were killed, officials said.
   Hospital officials said another 13 people were treated for bullet
wounds.
   The clash was between the student wings of the Pakistan People's
Party and the Muhajir Quami Movement, which represents Indian
immigrants who fled to Pakistan at the time of partition in 1947.
   ``This morning, the university looked like a battlefield,'' a
witness said. ``Students carrying Kalashnikovs took positions and
fired at each other indiscriminately.''
   Authorities closed the university following the shooting.
   The Pakistan People's Party, headed by Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, took power following elections last November. It also rules
the southern Sind province, where hundreds of people have died in
ethnic violence.

   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, plagued by scandal at
home, will try to project an image of international leadership at
the Paris summit of industrial nations July 14-16.
   But the prime minister is rumored to be near resignation because
of a sex scandal, and his political party is at a low point in its
34 years of rule.
   For Japan, the annual meeting with the United States, West
Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the head of the
European Community has in recent years been a stage on which it
tried to meet demands that it take leadership responsibilities in
line with its position as the capitalist world's second-largest
economic power.
   Uno is expected to pledge increased aid to poor countries, urge
cooperation to solve global environmental problems, stress the need
for exchange rate stability, and argue against isolating China from
the international community with sanctions, government officials
have said.
   But back home in Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party, already
reeling from a bribery scandal that forced the resignation of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, has been further damaged by reports that
Uno kept several paid mistresses.
   The party suffered a major loss in a Tokyo municipal election a
week ago, and prospects for a July 23 election for the upper house
of Parliament are dim.
   Uno has denied reports he plans to resign, but a number of party
elders have reportedly called on him to step down.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the government is confident Uno can credibly represent Japan at
the summit, despite his weak position at home. The summit nations
``can expect smooth implementation of whatever we say at the
summit,'' the official said.
   Government officials have indicated to reporters some of Japan's
plans for the meeting on the following topics:
   _China: The summit countries are expected to discuss a response
to the suppression of a democracy movement in which hundreds and
perhaps thousands of students and citizens were killed.
   As a close neighbor of China, its largest aid donor and its
largest trading partner outside of Hong Kong, Japan has been more
cautious than other countries in condemning the crackdown and
imposing economic sanctions. While Japan has temporarily stopped
discussions of aid and suspended meetings of senior officials, at
the summit it is expected to represent the voices of a number of
Asian countries opposed to driving their giant neighbor into
isolation.
   ``We have to have in mind how best to encourage reform and an
open-door policy in China. It is not an appropriate policy in the
long term to isolate China or push it toward a rapprochement with
the Soviet Union,'' Taizo Watanabe, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Friday.
   _Coordination of economic policies: Japan will support efforts to
control inflation that threatens a number of summit countries,
officials say.
   Japan also will stress the need for stability in exchange rates.
Some government officials suggest Uno will push for strengthening
coordinated intervention in currency markets, but it is unclear just
what Japan may recommend.
   ``We will try to convince other countries of the necessity of a
stable exchange rate system,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. He did not say how stability might
be achieved.
   _Third World debt: Japan is considering increasing the recycling
of its large trade surplus in aid to debt-ridden developing
countries to as much as $50 billion over three years, following a
$30 billion program from 1986 to 1989, according to a report by the
Kyodo News Service.
   Foreign Ministry officials would not confirm the figures cited in
the report, but it is expected that Japan will make a major
development aid pledge.
   _Trade: Japan will push through the settlement of trade disputes
through multilateral forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. It may with other countries at least indirectly criticize
the United States for its recent decision to implement a provision
of a 1988 trade act naming Japan, Brazil and India as unfair traders
potentially subject to sanctions.
   _Environment: Japan will propose increased global cooperation to
solve environmental problems, including depletion of the ozone
layer, global warming, the destruction of tropical forests and ocean
pollution.

Tax Evasion</HEAD>

   Gerald Wallace, the younger brother of
former Gov. George C. Wallace, will surrender to U.S. marshals next
week on charges of failing to pay income taxes on more than
$165,000, a federal prosecutor said.
   U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson said Friday the charges involve Gerald
Wallace's tax returns for 1984 and 1985 _ years when George Wallace
was serving as governor _ but they do not concern any work the
68-year-old Montgomery attorney was doing concerning state
government.
   Wilson described the fees as ``a private type thing'' paid by
individuals in the Mobile area, but he declined to elaborate.
   Gerald Wallace was a frequently at the Capitol during his
brother's four terms, but Wilson said the charges should not cast a
shadow on George Wallace's administrations, only on ``the named
defendant.''
   Telephone calls to Gerald Wallace's Montgomery law office and
home went unanswered Friday and again Saturday morning.
   Wilson said the two-count indictment for filing false income tax
returns was handed down by a federal grand jury in Montgomery late
Thursday afternoon. If convicted, Wallace could be sentenced to a
maximum of three years in prison and fined $100,000 on each count.
In addition, he could be required to pay back taxes and interest,
Wilson said.
   Wilson said the case began developing more than two years ago
based on information supplied by the state Department of Revenue.
The indictment against Wallace said he reported $255,943 in income
in 1984 and failed to report $30,195. In 1985, he reported $88,582
in income but failed to report about $135,000, the indictment
alleged.

   ``Just a Plain Musician?'' Musician, Yes. Plain, Never

   Matt Haimovitz has the face of a cherubic
choirboy and plays the cello like an angel.
   Now 18, he rejects the prodigy label, even though he has appeared
as soloist with the major symphony orchestras of the United States
and Europe for the past five years.
   ``I've always thought I was too old to be a prodigy,'' he says.
``I've always considered myself a young musician, just a plain
musician.''
   Musician, yes. Plain, never.
   Haimovitz, who was born in Israel and moved with his family to
California as a child, took his first cello lesson at 7. He became
violinist Itzhak Perlman's protege three years later. At 15, he was
the youngest musician ever to receive a coveted Avery Fisher grant
of $10,000 to spend on his career. In 1987, he was the youngest
artist ever signed for an exclusive recording contract by Deutsche
Grammophon.
   Perlman introduced Haimovitz to the noted cellist Leonard Rose,
who called the youngster a ``very extraordinary'' musician with `'a
ravishingly beautiful sound.'' Shortly before he died in 1984, Rose
gave Haimovitz one of his favorite cello bows and introduced him to
cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who became his coach and close friend.
   In a rare tribute to the boy's genius, Marta Istomin lent
Haimovitz a Matteo Goffriller cello that once belonged to her late
husband, the legendary Pablo Casals. Haimovitz has acquired his own
Goffriller, a rare and very expensive instrument made in Italy in
1710.
   Another brush with great musicians of the past came during a
recent, eight-city European tour when Haimovitz performed in
Frankfurt, West Germany, and met the granddaughter of the great
violinist Joseph Joachim, a friend of Brahms and Schumann.
   Haimovitz was applauded by his fellow musicians again Friday at a
rehearsal before his debut with the National Symphony Orchestra at
Wolf Trap Farm Park, the national performing arts center in the
Virginia countryside about 20 miles west of Washington.
   Haimovitz's colleagues in the orchestra's cello section slapped
their instruments in applause and shouted ``bravo'' when he
concluded a virtuoso performance of Tchaikovsky's ``Variations on a
Rococo Theme'' under the baton of guest conductor Hugh Wolff.
   Later, during a dressing room interview, Haimovitz was asked what
set him apart from other talented young musicians.
   ``Good fortune, maybe,'' he replied. He said he has been
privileged to play with _ and learn from _ some of the biggest names
in classical music. He has shared concert stages with the likes of
Perlman and Ma, Isaac Stern, Shlomo Mintz, Pinchas Zukerman,
Mstislav Rostropovich and James Levine.
   Rose advised his pupil to be very serious about music, but never
to take anything too seriously.
   ``He had a happy-go-lucky view of life, taking everything as it
comes,'' Haimovitz said. ``He also was humble and patient, and used
to tell me, `Never let it get to your head'.''
   Perlman, he said, ``inspired me to open up and let everything I
feel come out in a natural way.'' He calls the violinist ``my great
mentor and great inspiration.''
   ``Yo-Yo Ma is very philosophical and intellectual,'' he says.
``He asks me a lot of questions _ what this means, what that means.
We have a dialogue of ideas when we play together.''
   Following Rose's example of leading a well-rounded life,
Haimovitz enjoys trout fishing, hiking and rafting when he appears
at Aspen, Colorado. An avid tennis player, he is a John McEnroe fan
and doubled with pianist Emanuel Ax during the ``Brahms
Invitational'' tournament at Tanglewood a couple of years ago.
   He also enjoys people-watching during long walks through Central
Park and the streets of Manhattan. His father, a stock broker, and
mother, a pianist and arts educator, moved to New York from
California in 1982 to further their son's musical career.
   Haimovitz was graduated from Collegiate, a tough, highly
competitive preparatory school in New York, last month with a B-plus
average. An aspiring writer, he will enter Princeton University in
September under a special scholar's program that will enable him to
combine his studies with more than 40 concert appearances next
season.
   Yo-Yo Ma once asked him what he wanted his audiences to feel when
he played the cello.
   ``That they've had a wonderful meal and a stimulating
conversation,'' Haimovitz replied.

<HEAD>Three Arabs Dead, Two Shot By Palestinians, One By Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian assailants fatally shot two Arabs
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities, and soldiers
shot and killed a third Arab, news reports said today.
   The deaths raised to 549 the number of Palestinians killed in the
19-month uprising against Israeli rule. At least 33 Israelis have
also been slain.
   Fifteen Palestinians were reported injured in clashes with
soldiers that occurred Friday night and today in at least six towns
and refugee camps in the occupied territories, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed one Arab fatality and said it was
investigating the circumstances. Other casualty reports were being
checked, it said.
   Jewish militants continued stoning attacks on Arab cars, in
apparent retaliation for a bus crash caused by a Palestinian
passenger on Thursday, in which 14 people were killed and 27 injured.
   Protesters shouting ``Death to the Arabs!'' gathered in
Jerusalem's Shmuel Hanavi Quarter today and stoned Palestinian
motorists, smashing the window of at least one vehicle, police said.
One suspect was detained.
   On Friday night a 27-year-old Palestinian man was seriously
injured by a rock hurled at his car in Jerusalem's Talpiot quarter,
Arab reports said.
   Also today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said his Cabinet would
consider new measures to confront the uprising in response to the
bus crash, which was the worst assault on an Israeli target since
the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987.
   One possibility, Shamir said on Israel radio, was imposing a
death penalty on terrorists convicted of murder.
   Shamir gave no details about other restrictions being considered.
   Israeli law allows capital punishment as a sentence for murder,
but judges have refrained from giving this penalty to Arabs, fearing
possible retaliation against Israeli prisoners held in Arab
countries.
   One of the Palestinians slain today was Mustafa Abed el Saed, 42,
who was shot in the head and neck in Gaza City's Sejaiyeh Quarter as
he rode his motorcycle to work in Gaza City, Arab reports said.
   The reports said that El Saed was killed on suspicion of
providing information to the Israeli authorities.
   Palestinians also reportedly killed Ismail Hussein Al Ghoush, 55,
of Yatta in the West Bank. Al Ghoush was shot in the abdomen with a
pistol by masked men who broke into his home Friday night, Arab
reports said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the fatality in Yatta, calling it the
result ``of a clash between Arabs,'' and saying the shooting was
under investigation.
   In Gaza, soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing demonstrators in
a marketplace in Rafah, killing Ziad Zaki Abu Olwan, 20. Eight of
the 15 Palestinians wounded today were injured in the Rafah
confrontation.

<HEAD>Minister Under Fire For Saying Women Should Stay Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In another setback for Japan's embattled governing
party, the agriculture minister angered women throughout the country
Saturday by reportedly saying women are useless in politics and
should stay home.
   The chairwoman of the top opposition party said women will
remember the comments in national elections later this month.
Agriculture Minister Hisao Horinouchi, meanwhile, said he was
``misunderstood.''
   ``I deeply apologize for having made remarks that have bothered
so many women,'' Horinouchi, a senior member of the Liberal
Democratic Party, said at a televised news conference Saturday
evening, after reports of his comments surfaced. ``I would like to
retract them completely.''
   Major newspapers on Saturday quoted Horinouchi as saying in a
campaign speech that ``In the end, women's task is to stay home and
take care of their families.''
   Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, quoted Horinouchi
as posing the rhetorical question: ``Can women be useful in the
political world?'' ``Even if they advance (into parliament), they
can't work as legislators,'' he said.
   Several women represent the Liberal Democrats in the Diet,
Japan's parliament.
   The mass-circulation Sankei Shimbun newspaper quoted Horinouchi
as adding, ``England's Prime Minister (Margaret) Thatcher is
special. She has a husband and children. But Socialist Party
Chairwoman (Takako) Doi is single, and it is beyond such a person's
ability to serve as prime minister.''
   Horinouchi reportedly made the comments Friday in a speech to
party members in western Mie Prefecture. He was campaigning for an
election July 23 for half the 252 seats in the upper chamber of the
Diet.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, in trouble himself because of
allegations he kept several paid mistresses, told reporters early
Saturday he would seek an explanation from Horinouchi.
   Ms. Doi, who was campaigning Saturday in Osaka, said she was
``flabbergasted'' by the comments.
   ``But I believe that the response to the agriculture minister's
remarks will be clearly shown by election results,'' she said.
   ``By speaking that way, he showed his lack of understanding,''
Michiko Matsuura, head of the Japan League of Women Voters, told The
Associated Press. ``And women are going to react against this when
they vote.''
   Analysts predict the Liberal Democrats, the majority party in
Parliament for 34 years, could suffer major losses in the elections
because of voters' anger over a new 3-percent consumption tax, an
influence-peddling scandal that forced Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita to resign, and Uno's alleged extramarital affairs.
   Anger at Horinouchi's remarks was not limited to opposition
parties. A woman who answered the phone at the Liberal Democratic
Party's election committee said the comments were ``unpleasant and
ridiculous.''
   Such remarks ``are discriminatory against ... women and are
unforgivable,'' said a statement issued Saturday by lawmaker Manae
Kubota, head of the Socialist Party's Women's Bureau.
   The Socialist Party, the only major opposition group led by a
woman, and Socialist-backed candidates scored a victory in Tokyo
municipal elections one week ago, tripling their strength in that
128-member body from 12 seats to 36. The governing party lost 20
seats and now holds 43.
   In the Tokyo vote, 17 women were elected, up from seven in the
previous election in 1985, and analysts noted a high turnout among
woman voters, which they attributed in large part to the Uno sex
scandal.
   In a by-election June 29 in northern Niigata, Socialist candidate
Kinuko Ofuchi, a 44-year-old mother of two, defeated a Liberal
Democratic candidate.
   After a former geisha said Uno paid her more than $21,400 to be
his mistress for four months, Uno late last month was reported to be
considering resigning. Though reports have alleged he had
extramarital affairs with several other women, he has denied doing
anything immoral.
   The allegations were first made by a respected weekly magazine
soon after Uno replaced Takeshita on June 2.
   Takeshita was forced to resign due to links with the Recruit Co.,
a publishing conglomerate accused of doling out millions of dollars
in political donations and underpriced shares of stock in exchange
for political favors.

<HEAD>Bush Cautiously Urges Economic, Political Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush embarks Sunday on a historic
trip to Poland and Hungary, offering encouragement for their
revolutionary economic and political reforms and urging the rest of
communist Europe not to be ``lagging way behind.''
   Bush's journey marks the first visit to Eastern Europe by an
American president in nearly 12 years and the first ever to Hungary.
   The trip also will take Bush to Paris for an economic summit with
six Western allies and to the Netherlands for a one-day visit.
   Bush hopes the Paris meeting will produce a coordinated aid
program for Poland and Hungary, which are in the forefront of
reforms in Warsaw Pact countries but are struggling with massive
foreign debt.
   The four-day stop in Warsaw, Gdansk and Budapest will be watched
closely for comparisons with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's triumphant visit
last month to West Germany, where he was greeted by crowds of
hundreds of thousands of people, and with the Soviet president's
just-concluded trip to France, where the reception was more
restrained.
   Declaring himself unconcerned by Gorbachev's popularity in the
West, Bush said last week he expects a warm reception in the East.
U.S. officials have been working with opposition groups in Poland
and Hungary to turn out huge, cheering crowds.
   But in an interview with Hungarian journalists in Washington
released Saturday by the government-run media in Budapest, Bush
stressed he was not trying to stir the people against their
government.
   ``I think a country like the United States ought not to
over-promise, ought not to over-exhort for others to be like us and
thus make problems worse for the people,'' Bush said.
   The Eisenhower administration had encouraged the Hungarian revolt
but was powerless when the Soviets crushed it in 1956.
   ``This is a win-win trip for Bush,'' said Larry Sabato, a
University of Virginia political scientist. Gorbachev's tepid
reception in France ``lowers the standard of comparison'' between
the two leaders' trips.
   In Poland, the opposition's newspaper printed an advertisement
welcoming Bush and his wife, Barbara, and telling people where they
could be go to see them.
   Similar leaflets were distributed in Gdansk, where the Bushes
will lunch at the home of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa before
visiting a workers' monument outside the Lenin Shipyard, the Baltic
Sea birthplace of the trade movement.
   Bush's trip comes at a time of extraordinary change and political
uncertainty in both Poland and Hungary.
   When Bush delivers a speech before the Polish National Assembly,
nearly half the lawmakers will be representatives of the once-banned
Solidarity union. They won their seats in the freest elections in
Eastern Europe in the post-war era.
   When he meets with the communist leadership in Hungary, he will
be talking to self-declared reformers who until recently were on the
fringes of power. Hungary permits free speech, tolerates dissidents,
has a stock market with nearly 150 listings and, unlike Poland, has
a plentiful _ but expensive _ supply of consumer goods
   ``These are historic times,'' Bush said in a speech last week.
``What's at stake is not just movement towards economic and
political liberalization in Poland and Hungary but the prospect of
ending the post-war division of Europe.''
   At a separate news conference, Bush prodded all of the Soviet
Union's partners to adopt reforms, saying that better relations with
the West hinge on certain conditions:
   ``A little more democracy. A little more freedom. A little more
openness.
   ``Come along with the flow. Things are changing in Eastern
Europe. Don't be lagging way behind. Get out in front. Don't be
afraid of democracy and freedom. It isn't going to hurt anybody.''
   Bush said his trip was not intended to stir up trouble for
Gorbachev or drive wedges between Moscow and its allies.
   ``I am delighted when he goes to Germany,'' Bush said. ``I am
pleased when he goes to France. It is good for world peace that he
takes those trips. And I expect he will be delighted when I go to
Poland and when I go to Hungary.''
   While Bush appeals for change in Eastern Europe, Poland and
Hungary are pleading for Western assistance to help them cope with
crippling Western debt with a combined total exceeding $55 billion.
   Bush already has rejected Solidarity's proposal for a $10 billion
package of credits and investment guarantees from the West. Bush
said that Polish leaders _ Communists and reformers alike _ have to
accept the need of moving their economy to a free-market system.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, dismissing $10 billion as
``not feasible or possible at this time,'' said that ``to simply
grant relief or make highly concessionary loans without reform, in
the final analysis, will not get them where they want to go.''
   Baker said that was the approach used in the 1970s and ``it
certainly didn't have beneficial effects.''
   Officials said that Bush's aid proposal will require austerity
measures by the Poles and Hungarians and will not involve direct
financial help.
   More likely, Bush is expected to offer support for loans from
international lending institutions such as the International
Monetary Fund, press for restructuring and rescheduling of debt owed
by Poland and Hungary and offer incentives for private investment in
those countries. Bush announced some of these steps in a speech in
April.
   The administration expressed disappointment that Congress had not
completed action on a package of trade concessions for Poland and
Hungary by the time of Bush's trip.
   One measure would make exports from Poland eligible for duty-free
treatment. A second bill would allow a five-year extension of
most-favored-nation trade status to Hungary. That has the effect of
suspending a law that bars trade concessions to certain communist
nations until the United States is satisfied they have liberalized
emigration policies.
   In a reward for Hungary's decision to hold talks on multiparty
elections, Bush also said he will seek approval to lower tariffs for
Hungarian imports.

<TEXT>
   Carlos Menem, a three-time
provincial governor and former political prisoner who has stirred
hopes in a country mired in economic crisis, was sworn in today as
Argentina's 46th president.
   The 59-year-old attorney and son of Syrian immigrants called for
national unity. His acceptance speech in Congress drew repeated
applause.
   ``Argentina is not well,'' he said. ``It's broken. ... From these
ruins, we will construct the country we deserve.
   ``This crisis is not an excuse. It is an opportunity, a
challenge,'' he told senators, deputies and guests in the ornate,
chandeliered chamber.
   It was the country's first peaceful transition of political power
between two elected presidents since 1928.
   ``With faith and hope, we're going to move forward,'' he said
earlier today as he left his apartment for Congress. Crowds along
the way were enthusiastic but sparse on a chilly, overcast winter
morning.
   Also today, Congress formally accepted the resignations of
President Raul Alfonsin and Vice President Victor Martinez.
Alfonsin's election in 1983 ended a harsh seven-year military
dictatorship.
   In a short written statement read by the parliamentary secretary,
Alfonsin said, ``The government's room for action was too limited to
have much chance of success in dealing with problems in which any
delay would cause greater suffering for everyone.''
   Menem, 59, won election May 14 to return the Peronist Party to
power in the pink Government House for the first time since 1976.
   Alfonsin, a human rights attorney, was prevented by law from
running for re-election. Beset by increasing economic problems and
military unrest, Alfonsin succumbed to pressure and decided to give
up power five months before his constitutional mandate ended.
   The preceding Peronist government was overthrown by a military
coup. After Isabel Peron was toppled in March 1976, she was put
under house arrest and Menem, then the governor of rural La Rioja
Province, was jailed for nearly five years.
   Menem takes over a nearly bankrupt country that has been wracked
by hyperinflation, rising unemployment and worsening unrest,
including food riots in which 14 people were killed in May.
   The Central Bank is virtually without reserves and is $4.5
billion behind in payments on the $60 billion foreign debt, which is
the third-largest in the developing world behind Brazil and Mexico.
The austral, the national currency, has lost 97 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar in four months.
   Prices on goods and services have to be readjusted for inflation
nearly daily, far outstripping wage increases that are usually
granted monthly, and hunger in a country that exports beef and grain
to the world is becoming more common.
   Residents of shantytowns in Rosario, Argentina's third-biggest
city and a meat-packing center, looted food stores again this week,
prompting the arrests about 750 people.
   About 25 percent of the 10 million residents in metropolitan
Buenos Aires live in poverty, a three-fold increase since 1980,
according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census. Nearly
one of every three Argentines lives in Buenos Aires, the country's
cultural and financial capital.
   Menem plans to act quickly in the hopes of curtailing inflation
and restarting Argentina's agricultural-based economy. Toward that
end, he appointed a multiparty Cabinet that pledged national unity,
to lower the fiscal deficit and to try to attract foreign investment.
   Menem, who likes to wear white suits and sport his trademark long
sideburns, reportedly has plans to try to streamline inefficient
state companies but similar plans by the Alfonsin government were
repeatedly blocked by the Peronists, who are labor-based and fear
loss of jobs.
   Argentines, once jubilant at the election of Alfonsin, now view
Menem with a desperate hope.
   ``I don't know if I'm happy or sad. I just hope he can do
something,'' said Roberto Cucho, a public relations specialist.
``Gas, food, bus fares _ everything _ seems to have gone up by 100
percent in one day. It's infernal.''
   Delegations from more than 70 countries, seven of them led by
heads of state and including U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, have arrived for the inauguration.
   It will be the first time in 61 years that an elected Argentine
president has given up power to an elected president from a
different party.
   The country has suffered six military coups since 1930.
   Alfonsin was to have served through Dec. 10. He announced on June
12 that he was powerless to stabilize the economy. Menem
subsequently agreed to take office early.
   The heads of state included Peru's Alan Garcia and Nicaragua's
Daniel Ortega. During the afternoon, Ortega and Menem chatted at the
luxurious Alvear Palace Hotel, sipping the herbal tea mate.

<HEAD>Army Orders Grounding of About 3,400 Huey Helicopters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has temporarily grounded more than
3,400 UH1 Huey helicopters so a defective part installed in some of
the choppers can be replaced, a spokesman said Saturday.
   The spokesman, Lt. Col. John Chapla, said, ``The grounding was
ordered following confirmation that a part that does not conform to
the Army's manufacturing standards may have been installed in some
helicopters.''
   He said the part, known as a universal control lever, is a
component of the system in UH1H, UH1V and UH1D series helicopters
that enables the pilot to control the aircraft.
   ``Army analysis indicated that the part showed hydrogen
embrittlement, a defect that leaves the part subject to potential
failure,'' Chapla said. ``Failure of the part could cause loss of
control of the aircraft.''
   The spokesman said the U.S. Army has about 3,000 UH1H Hueys as
well as 400 to 500 UH1V helicopters specially equipped for medical
evacuation.
   The UH1Ds have been provided to other countries, and Chapla said
the Army was advising foreign governments that they also should be
grounded. He said he did not have information on how many
helicopters of that model were involved.
   Chapla said two other Huey helicopter models, the UH1C and UH1M,
were not affected by the grounding order.

<HEAD>Factional Strife Rocks Beirut; Six Reported Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias battled in
the streets of west Beirut on Saturday, while Syrian and Christian
gunners dueled with howitzers across the city's dividing Green Line.
   By police count, six people were killed and 28 wounded in the
separate fighting.
   A police spokesman said three people were killed and 12 wounded
in overnight clashes between the Syrian-backed mainstream Shiite
Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The two factions are vying for dominance of the 1.2 million
Shiites, the largest sect in Lebanon.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with police rules,
said the fighting with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades damaged dozens of cars and started fires in several
apartments.
   The intermittent clashes erupted anew July 1, with the fighting
over the last two days starting in the seaside Ouzai district and
spreading to nearby Haret Hreik.
   Helmeted Syrian troops responsible for security in west Beirut
patrolled the two districts in an effort to disengage the
combatants, the police spokesman said.
   ``The situation is calm, but very tense. Gunmen remain in
entrances to buildings,'' he said.
   Another three people died and 16 were wounded in artillery duels
between Syrian and Christian gunners, police said.
   This brought the overall toll to 408 people killed and 1,574
wounded in the confrontation, which began in March after the army
commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, closed illegal militia-run ports that
were sapping the nation of tax revenues.
   Syria and its allied militias retaliated by bombarding the
Christian enclave, home to about 1 million people.
   The dispute was complicated Friday by threats from Nabih Berri,
head of the Shiite Amal militia, to obtain medium-range missiles to
counter Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles believed delivered to the
Christians from Iraq.
   The missiles have a range of 43 miles, meaning they could hit the
Syrian capital, Damascus, from the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
northeast of Beirut.
   Berri, Syria's closest ally in Lebanon, threatened to deploy
Frog-7s in Moslem areas.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the assistant secretary general of the Arab
League, met with Aoun on Saturday in an effort to resolve the issue.
It was his third meeting with Aoun in as many days.
   A source close to Aoun, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Ibrahimi is proposing that a special security committee be created
to search ships heading to ports to ensure they are not carrying
weapons.
   ``Syria accepts this proposal,'' the source said.
   He said Aoun ``accepts that a ban on the import of weapons be
imposed on all militias in Lebanon. But he strongly rejects the
imposing of such measures on the Lebanese army, because the army
cannot be treated as a militia,'' the source added.
   ``Whether an army imports weapons or not is a decision for its
command and its national authorities to take. This is a practice of
sovereignty that the general will not give up,'' he said.
   After his 90-minute discussion with Aoun, Ibrahimi crossed to
west Beirut and held a meeting with 10 Moslem parliament deputies.
   He described his talks as ``good and positive,'' but refused to
disclose details.
   Ibrahimi was sent by the leaders of Morocco, Saudi Arabia and
Algeria, who were assigned by an Arab summit in May to find a
settlement to Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>District Plans to Hold Makers, Sellers Liable for Handgun Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council is poised to
pass legislation that would hold handgun manufacturers financially
liable for shooting injuries or deaths, but pro-gun forces hope to
stop the measure on Capitol Hill.
   The bill, created in an attempt to slow the record murder rate
and drug-related crime wave in the nation's capital, is the first of
its kind in the nation. It would allow relatives of shooting and
murder victims to sue the manufacturer and dealer of the weapon.
   A final vote on the legislation will be held Tuesday. If passed,
it must be reviewed by Congress, which has ultimate legislative
authority over the district.
   ``I don't think Congress will allow the bill to become law,''
said Richard Gardner, state and local affairs director at the
National Rifle Association. ``The bill places an extreme limitation
on interstate commerce, and the federal government is the only body
that can regulate interstate commerce.''
   Since the district's strict 1976 handgun ordinance bans the sale
or manufacture of weapons in the nation's capital, the law could
only be applied to manufacturers in other states, Gardner said.
   ``It's going to be tough up there,'' conceded council chairman
David Clarke, one of the bill's sponsors. ``I wouldn't even
undertake it if I didn't believe so strongly that the legislation
would help.''
   Speaking at a public hearing on the bill held last month, D.C.
Corporation Counsel Frederick Cooke also said the bill might violate
interstate commerce provisions protected by the Constitution.
   However, Clarke argued that plenty of legal precedent exists for
such a bill.
   ``Strict liability laws exist in many states and have not been
held to infringe on interstate commerce,'' Clarke said. ``Some
states regulate dynamite, other states liquor _ the newness here is
the application to handguns.''
   The bill passed by an 8-4 margin in a preliminary vote held two
weeks ago.
   However, at least one House member is planning to fight the bill
if it pases the council.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a frequent critic of the district
government, is expected to try to block the legislation when it
reaches the House. Last month, Parris likened the bill to an attempt
``to hold Black and Decker responsible for the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre.''
   Parris was on vacation and unavailable for comment Friday, his
office said.
   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a member of the House Appropriations
District of Columbia subcommittee, is being pressured by the NRA to
oppose the measure, but Carr aides said he is unlikely to introduce
legislation to scuttle the city law.
   The NRA is also asking other members to oppose the bill, Gardner
said.
   City officials have said extra police _ and stricter handgun
legislation _ are needed to stem the murder rate. Through Friday,
225 people have been killed in Washington in 1989, compared with 153
at that time last year. In 1988, a record 372 people were killed.
   Police blame more than 60 percent of these slayings on drugs.

<HEAD>Tehran Paper Warns of Violence If Britain Rejets Moslem Demands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tehran newspaper said Saturday that
Britain's Moslems might resort to violence if the British government
does not punish author Salman Rushdie, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   ``The Moslems in Britain might have to consider ways that perhaps
might not sit well with the desire for coexistence,'' the agency
quoted the English-language daily Tehran Times as saying in an
editorial.
   ``If and when such developments shape up, it will be only out of
ignorance that one could blame the Moslem community for the violence
that might occur,'' the paper added.
   The warning came two days after a bomb blast damaged a London
bookshop. British authorities said the bomb was part of Moslems'
campaign against Rushdie's latest novel, ``The Satanic Verses,''
which some consider insulting to Islam.
   Moslems have demanded the amendment of Britain's blasphemy law so
that legal action can be taken against Rushdie.
   The Indian-born author, who is a naturalized British citizen, has
been in hiding since Feb. 14 when the late Iranian spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued an edict urging Moslems to kill
him.
   Two Iranian Moslem clergymen backed Khomeini by offering a total
of $5.2 million for Rushdie's death.
   Moslems in Britain have staged several public demonstrations
since then demanding the banning of the novel and Rushdie's
punishment.
   The issue led Iran to break diplomatic relations with London in
March.
   The Tehran Times said that it was predictable that given ``the
racist orientation'' of the Cabinet of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, ``no justice would be done to the Moslem
minority.''

<HEAD>Computer Association to Lift Ban on Soviet Contacts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major international association of computer
professionals is planning to lift an 8-year-old ban on contacts with
the Soviet Union because of improvements in human rights and
scientific freedom, according to the group's president.
   At the same time, the Association for Computing Machinery has
sent letters to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and other Beijing
officials expressing shock over violent suppression of the
pro-democracy movement and warning that professional exchanges with
China could be jeopardized.
   Bryan Kocher, president of the 73,000-member, New York-based
association, said the ban on formal contacts with Moscow had been
adopted in 1981, primarily in response to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
   ``We stopped cooperating with any conferences that were being
sponsored in the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``We stopped allowing
their official delegations to register for our conferences.
Basically, we just shut them out.''
   Kocher said he expects that the ban will be rescinded at the next
meeting of the association's board of directors, scheduled for late
next month in San Francisco.
   The Soviets have ``lightened up quite a bit and gotten out of
Afghanistan, so the reason for banning cooperative ventures with
them has now disappeared,'' he said.
   Kocher added that ``we are mightily impressed by the progress
that's being made there (in the Soviet Union), and would really like
to encourage further progress in the area of human rights and
scientific freedom.''
   Regarding China, he said it was estimated that 10 percent to 15
percent of the 40,000 Chinese students currently attending U.S.
colleges and universities are studying computer science or
engineering.
   ``A fair number of those students and some of the visiting
faculty are members of the ACM,'' Kocher said. ``We are rather
concerned about what might happen to those people if they try to go
back, which we assume they will at some point.''
   He noted that ``a lot of the students here were supporting the
freedom demonstrators there, and there's some amount of worry that
their professors and our colleagues have about their safety when
they return.''
   Kocher and Barbara Simons, head of the association's Scientific
Freedom and Human Rights Committee, late last month sent letters to
Deng and Zhou Guangzhao, president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, saying they were ``shocked by the recent violent
suppression of peaceful dissent in China.''
   ``It is our sincere hope that technological exchanges with China
involving computer professionals will not be further jeopardized by
repressive policies of the Chinese government,'' Kocher and Ms.
Simons wrote.
   In a report to be published next month, the Scientific Freedom
and Human Rights Committee said that of 134 Soviet computer
professionals listed in its last report four years ago, 73 have been
released from prison or emigrated.
   ``With the accession of (Soviet President) Mikhail Gorbachev, and
his policy of glasnost (openness), there have been improvements with
respect to human rights,'' it said.
   The report said ``the number of political prisoners, both
computer professionals and others, has decreased significantly and
many reported as having been denied exit visas have now emigrated.''
   But it added that ``while crediting the Soviet Union with
improvements, we note that many human rights problems have yet to be
resolved.''
   The report is to be published in the August issue of the
association's journal, Communications of the ACM.

<TEXT>
   Two Brazilian soccer players were
charged with assault Saturday after allegedly kicking a referee
during a match, the national news agency TT reported.
   The incident occured Friday night during a Stockholm Soccer Cup
semifinal between the Botafogo team from Brazil and Spanga IS, a
local team.
   Stig Sterneberg, a police duty officer, said the Swedish referee,
Kaari Grundstrom, was attacked when he ordered a Brazilian player
off the field in a match that had been ``messy'' from the start.
   ``A Botafogo coach rushed onto the field. At the same time, the
referee was kicked to the ground by one player and in the head by
another,'' he said.
   The referee suffered minor injuries and briefly lost
consciousness. He was able to go home after seeing a doctor,
Sterneberg said.
   One player, 33, said during court proceedings that he had been
ordered off the field earlier in the match, and he denied ever going
near Grundstrom, the national news agency TT said.
   The other player, 26, admitted he pushed Grundstrom but couldn't
remember beating him, TT said. The player had been disqualified from
the tournament for foul play.
   None of the players was identified.
   Police detained four members of Botafogo, but only two were in
police custody. One was released and another was banned from leaving
Stockholm and ordered to report regularly to the police.
   The team was participating in a tournament involving about 5,000
players from 15 countries. The 14 other Brazilian teams
participating apologized to the board of judges for Botafogo's
behavior, TT said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Blasts Ruling Protecting Diplomat's Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEDFORD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international court's ruling against
extradition of a double-murder suspect prompted ``outrage'' from
officials here, and a vow that capital charges won't be dropped
despite the ruling that the death penalty violates human rights.
   Bedford Commonwealth's Attorney James Updike said Friday he will
ask the U.S. State Department to pressure British officials to
ignore the ruling and extradite Jens Soering, a West German
diplomat's son.
   Updike called the ruling outrageous and said he it believed it
was based on politics and diplomacy rather than logic.
   Soering, 22, is accused of stabbing and slitting the throats of
Derek and Nancy Haysom in their Bedford County home in March 1985.
The retired steel executive and his wife were the parents of
Soering's girlfriend at the time, Elizabeth Haysom. She pleaded
guilty to helping plan the slayings and is serving a 90-year prison
sentence in Virginia. Soering was arrested in Britain.
   The European Court of Human Rights ruled Friday that extraditing
Soering would violate his human rights because he faces the death
penalty.
   Rulings by the court, a branch of the 23-nation Council of
Europe, are not binding to the 23 nations but are rarely ignored.
   Soering, who is in a London prison, has been fighting extradition
to the United States since May 1986. West Germany has also requested
his extradition, seeking to let him stand trial there under a law
that allows West Germans accused of crimes in other countries to be
tried in their homeland. He would face a maximum sentence of 10 to
15 years if tried in West Germany.
   Soering boasted in a letter to Ms. Haysom a few months after
their arrest in London that diplomatic steps would block his
extradition to Bedford County. She had returned to the United States
voluntarily.
   ``Those yokels don't know what's coming down,'' Soering had
written in a letter, which became public during Ms. Haysom's legal
proceedings. He predicted he would go to West Germany, ``and then
I'll be out in a surprisingly short time.''
   Updike was incensed by that prospect Friday.
   ``This individual brutally murdered two human beings,'' Updike
said during a news conference at the Bedford County Courthouse.
``They may very well turn him loose.''
   Soering's attorney said the European Court's decision ``means
that the tragedy of four years ago will not be compounded by another
homicide.''
   ``For the U.S., it means that a significant segment of the
world's population now rejects the U.S. death penalty system,''
Richard Neaton said in a statement released from his office in
Detroit, where Soering's father was stationed.
   Updike said the decision ``is founded in politics and diplomacy.
It is without question, outrageous.''
   The international court allowed extradition in two previous death
penalty cases, he said, and the only difference in this case was
that the defendant had diplomatic and political connections.
   Updike also challenged the court's argument that Soering, if
found guilty, would face years on death row _ punishment that would
breach his rights under the European Human Rights Convention.
   ``If there is a delay in the appellate process it occurs at his
request,'' Updike said.
   Updike maintained he would not compromise by dropping the capital
murder charge and agreeing to try Soering on lesser charges of
first-degree murder.
   ``I do not negotiate with murderers,'' he said. ``I'm not going
to negotiate with him or anyone else on his behalf. ... Murder is
not a matter of diplomacy.''
   Soering's father, Klaus Soering, is vice consul at the West
German consulate in Detroit. The German government argued on behalf
of his son before the European court.
   The Council of Europe, the oldest organization striving for
European unity, was founded in 1949 and is separate from the
12-nation European Economic Community.

   Sen. John Glenn, the first American to orbit

the Soviet Union in space because the United States would have to
reveal a lot of advanced technology.
   ``I don't want to see the focal point of the world's attention on
scientific greatness going to the Soviet Union and the kids of the
world aspiring to go to Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow instead
of Ohio State or Cal Tech or MIT,'' the Ohio Democrat said in a

   He said the United States and the Soviet Union have had
cooperative programs for a long time _ the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz linkup
in space was an example _ but said some agreements were not carried
out by the Soviets.
   Glenn said he would not object to having the Soviets taking part
in the space station program by buying a module as the European
Space Agency and the Japanese are doing.
   ``If we start cooperation like that, OK,'' Glenn said. ``But as
far as having another Apollo-Soyuz type thing, I'd sort of question
that one.''

   Bush administration officials said Saturday
that hard-line positions adopted by Israeli and Palestinian leaders
have dealt a potentially fatal setback to hopes that proposed
elections in the occupied territories could be a step toward peace.
   An official who flew to this Arabian Peninsula sultanate aboard
Secretary of State James A. Baker's plane told reporters that
neither side had shown much restraint since the Palestinian election
proposal was set forth by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in
April.
   At a news conference in Brunei on Friday, Baker characterized as
``not helpful'' a series of restrictions agreed to by Israel's Likud
Party concerning terms for the proposed election in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
   Flying here from Brunei for a 36-hour visit, reporters traveling
with Baker were told that the Likud position was akin to the
Palestinian demand, announced previously, that elections are not
feasible so long as the Israeli occupation continues.
   ``These are the kind of things that fall under the category of
deal breakers,'' said the official, insisting on anonymity. ``We had
requested that both sides refrain from doing that. Both sides have
done it.''
   The official said that both sides are responding to the pressure
of hard-line elements from within their respective ranks.
   The Likud demands most upsetting to U.S. officials involved the
pledge to continue expansion of Israeli settlements in the
territories and the demand that elections be deferred with the
Palestinians end their 18-month uprising against Israeli rule.
   ``We will continue to try to work with this proposal because we
always thought it offered us the best possibility of getting the
parties into negotiations,'' the official said.
   But, he added, ``there's no doubt that this makes it harder to
make progress.''
   The elections would be designed to choose ``interlocutors'' who
would be authorized to negotiate terms of a settlement with Israeli
officials.
   The official said that if the election idea proves unworkable,
the United States may look ``a bit more closely'' at proposals to
advance the peace process through an international conference on the
Middle East.
   ``But we're not at that point yet,'' he said.
   At his Friday news conference, Baker indicated that one source of
encouragement to him was that the new restrictions concerning the
elections were those of the Likud Party and not the Israeli
government.
   The U.S. position is that the administration deals with
governments and that the Likud stand is an internal Israeli domestic
political issue.
   But the senior official who briefed reporters seemed to
acknowledge that there is not much of a difference between the Likud
position and that of the government under Israel's coalition
arrangement between the Likud and the Labor parties.
   Baker arrived here in the early morning hours after visits to
Japan and Brunei, where he attended a conference of the six-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other outside
parties.
   Although he has brief meetings planned with Omani officials, the
principle purpose of the trip purpose of his visit is to rest up for
the four-country European trip he will undertake with President Bush
starting Sunday in Poland.
   The highlight of the trip will be the seven-nation economic
summit of industrialized countries in Paris this week.

<HEAD>Medal of Honor Restored to Buffalo Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: REWRITES throughout to CORRECT name of medal to Medal of Honor,

<DATELINE>CODY, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-two years after Congress stripped
Buffalo Bill Cody of his Medal of Honor, the Indian scout's name has
been restored to the honor roll.
   ``He's entitled to the honor, he was given the honor and he
should have the honor,'' said Buffalo Bill's grandson, 76-year-old
Bill G. Cody. ``We've always contended that once he was awarded the
medal, they shouldn't revoke it _ especially after he was dead.''
   William F. ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody, who became a famous western
showman after the Indian wars, received the medal in 1872 for his
gallantry as an Army scout during the wars.
   But it was revoked, along with medals of 910 other recipients, in
1917 after Congress retroactively tightened up the rules for the
honor. Among other changes, Congress held that only enlisted men and
officers could receive the award. A scout was considered a civilian;
in all, five scouts lost medals in 1917.
   U.S. Sens. Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop, who jointly announced
the Army's decision Friday, said Buffalo Bill deserved the honor.
   ``Today's action by the Army sets the record straight,'' Wallop
said. ``After extensive research and review of the facts, the Army
has decided that Buffalo Bill clearly deserves our nation's highest
honor.''
   Buffalo Bill gained fame for his western show that toured the
country and Europe glamorizing the western frontier with real
cowboys and Indians re-enacting battles.
   Paul Fees, senior curator of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center
in Cody, Wyo. _ a town named for Buffalo Bill _ said the western
show may have cost Buffalo Bill some credibility as a real hero.
   Friday's action restores that credibility, said Fees.
   ``The fact that this medal was restored for cause, people can
believe that he was a true hero and earned his reputation rather
than had it invented for him through press agents,'' said Fees.
   Buffalo Bill, known by his contemporaries as a Pony Express
rider, Indian scout and buffalo hunter, received the honor for valor
after leading a cavalry charge against a raiding band of Sioux
Indians. He killed two, recovered several horses, and pursued the
retreating band.
   Although Buffalo Bill's name was stricken from the Medal of Honor
roll in February 1917, one month after he died, the medal itself was
never recalled and remains in the historical center.
   Fees said only one of the other 910 persons to lose medals in the
1917 purge of the rolls has since regained it, a woman Army surgeon
during the Civil War whose medal was restored in 1978.
   He said he hoped that the families of the other four scouts
affected by the 72-year-old ruling would take the same steps the
Cody family did to get their relatives' medals awarded again.

<HEAD>Abortion Advocates Worried About Public Hospital Ban</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If other states follow Missouri's lead and ban abortions in
public hospitals, it could undermine the nation's system of
providing legal abortions, some medical and legal experts say.
   Although relatively few abortions are conducted in public
hospitals, advocates say they provide a vital link in the abortion
chain by training physicians, counseling patients and performing
abortions for poor women and those who are considered high medical
risks.
   ``If you lose public hospitals, you lose all abortions,'' said
Alice Kirkman, a spokeswoman for the National Abortion Federation,
an association of abortion providers.
   The Supreme Court last week upheld key provisions of Missouri's
law limiting abortions, including a ban on most abortions in public
hospitals.
   Of the 1.6 million abortions performed in the United States in
1985, 87 percent took place in clinics or doctor's offices, while
only 13 percent were in hospitals, according to the
pro-abortion-rights Alan Guttmacher Institute.
   Only 265 of the 1,191 hospitals performing abortions were
classified as public.
   ``You're really not talking about a major proportion of all
abortions,'' said Larry Gage, president of the National Association
of Public Hospitals. ``But that doesn't mean that public hospitals
... aren't an important part of the process.''
   The 85 members of his association train 20 percent of all medical
residents in the country, Gage said. The NAPH represents mostly
large, urban, government-run hospitals.
   ``These are enormously important training grounds for our
obstetricians and gynecologists, people who will be called upon to
perform abortions _ if they remain legal,'' he said.
   Missouri's law bars public facilities and public employees from
performing an abortion unless it is necessary to save a woman's life.
   Advocates on both sides of the issue say life-threatening
pregnancies are rare and that the ruling will effectively halt
abortions in Missouri's public hospitals.
   The most drastic scenarios assume that the Missouri law will
sweep like wildfire through the other 49 state legislatures, which
few say seems likely. Some experts say last week's ruling is mainly
important as a precurser of more sweeping action by the Supreme
Court next year.
   In the short term, the ruling won't change many lives. Missouri
officials so far have applied the law to only two public hospitals,
which together accounted for only 90 of the state's 17,382 abortions
in 1988.
   In other places with more liberal abortion policies, public
hospitals take a more active role. More than 8,000 of New York
City's 100,000 abortions in 1985 were performed in city-run
facilities. But New York is unlikely to outlaw such abortions.
   The ultimate effect of the Missouri law is difficult to gauge, in
part because the Supreme Court ruling raises a sticky question: What
is a public facility?
   The short answer is that nobody seems quite sure.
   Is it a government owned and operated hospital? Yes. Is it a
privately owned hospital that relies heavily on public funds?
Probably. Is it a privately owned hospital that accepts only
Medicare payments? Who knows.
   ``It's confusing to me,'' conceded Mark Roebuck, a spokesman for
the Missouri Department of Health. ``I'm trying to find answers to
it myself.''
   ``It's not surprising that there's confusion,'' Gage said.
``There was confusion in the decision itself.''
   Gage referred to a concurring opinion by Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor in which she brushed aside an argument that the law could
lead to abortion bans at private hospitals whose only public subsidy
was public water and sewage lines.
   Whether such a ban would be constitutional ``need not be decided
here,'' she said.
   James Bopp, general counsel for the National Right to Life
Committee, laughed at the sewage argument. ``I wouldn't go that
far,'' he said. ``I don't think that's what's contemplated here.''
   Yet Bopp said he did think the Missouri law could be applied to
private hospitals that accept Medicare payments _ a definition that
would include virtually every hospital in the country.
   He compared the abortion issue to civil rights cases in which
courts have found that institutions that discriminate cannot receive
federal funds.
   ``There's an important public policy in prohibiting
discrimination based on race,'' Bopp said, ``and in our view there's
an important public policy in choosing childbirth over abortion.''

<TEXT>
   A 63-year-old woman who disappeared after
she was accused of killing her lover 21 years ago, only to be
discovered earlier this year, has pleaded guilty to a charge of
manslaughter.
   Bernice Van Heise, also known as Gretta Knickerbocker, was
accused in the Jan. 31, 1968, shooting death of Eugene Douglas, a
48-year-old Glenview artist.
   She had told police after the killing that the gun fired
accidentally when she was handing it to Douglas, authorities said.
Douglas was killed by a single gunshot to the back of the head.
   A judge had initially rejected a murder charge, ruling there was
insufficient evidence. A grand jury later indicted her for murder,
but she had disappeared. The indictment was withdrawn in 1975.
   Ms. Van Heise was re-indicted in February after authorities
received a tip and located her in the rural town of Elburn, about 40
miles west of Chicago, where she went by the name Gretta
Knickerbocker. She and her husband of 20 years, Conrad
Knickerbocker, had moved there in 1976 from the Chicago suburb of
Hinsdale.
   Ms. Van Heise pleaded guilty Thursday before Lake County Circuit
Judge Harry Hartel.
   Ms. Van Heise's attorney, Harold McKenney, told Hartel he had
advised his client against making the plea, but considered her
competent to do so.
   Assistant state's attorneys Joe Collina and Robin Goodstein told
Hartel that witnesses would testify that Ms. Van Heise and Douglas
had been having an affair for about a year and that she shot Douglas
when he told her he was ending it to return to his wife and children.
   Sentencing was set for Aug. 18. Hartel said that under laws in
effect at the time of the shooting, she could be sentenced to a
maximum of 20 years. However, he told Ms. Van Heise that he was
considering a sentence of between one and three years in prison.

   Three years after a trial, a federal judge
still has not ruled in a case that could change the way an estimated
60,000 newspaper reporters, editors and photographers in this
country are paid.
   The trial of the U.S. Department of Labor vs. the Concord Monitor
took just 10 days in June 1986, but court officials say there is no
deadline for U.S. District Judge Shane Devine to act and no
indication when he will.
   The Labor Department charged that the Monitor owed about $46,000
in overtime to 51 employees who worked at the 21,500-circulation
newspaper from February 1978 until January 1980.
   Central to the case is the definition of a ``professional.''
   The Monitor _ the first paper not to settle such a lawsuit out of
court in 40 years _ argued that journalists are professionals and
therefore exempt from overtime provisions of the 1934 Fair Labor
Standards Act.
   The act labels most reporters, editors and photographers as
non-professionals and eligible for overtime pay or compensatory time
off for hours worked past a 40-hour limit.
   The regulations define editorial writers, columnists, critics and
``top-flight'' writers of analytical and interpretive articles as
professionals.
   Others considered professional include those with a knowledge of
a particular field, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, and those
whose work is ``original and creative in character in a recognized
field of artistic endeavors,'' such as dancers, actors, painters and
short-story writers.
   Journalists' unions and other organizations, in the awkward
position of having to argue that their members are not
professionals, warned that if the Monitor prevails, it could mean
long hours and low pay for the nation's journalists.
   Barry Lipton, president of The Newspaper Guild's Local 3 in New
York, said Thursday that Devine's delay hurts journalists.
   ``We would expect to prevail on the issue, and the absence of a
ruling has a tendency to make everything cloudy,'' Lipton said in a
telephone interview. ``I think the law in general responds too
slowly to labor matters.''
   George Wilson, the Monitor's president and former publisher, said
Thursday that pending a ruling, his newspaper has been complying
with the Labor Department's interpretation of federal law, ``even if
we disagree with the findings.''
   Wilson speculated that Devine has not issued an opinion yet
because the Concord court, which has only two judges, has been
inundated by a dramatic increase in felony trials and other complex
civil cases.
   During the trial, Monitor officials argued that 40-year-old
interpretations of the federal overtime law used a now-outdated
notion of how journalists work.
   Then, many reporters were ``legmen,'' gathering facts and
telephoning them into the newsroom for someone else to write, they
said.
   Media experts testifying for the Monitor said contemporary
reporters and editors regularly use creativity, imagination and
specialized knowledge.
   ``On the one hand, we have tried to encourage a bright,
intelligent staff to work on its own, and on the other hand we had
the Labor Department's timeclock mentality,'' Wilson said as the
trial closed.
   The department focused on whether Monitor employees were
discouraged from filing for overtime pay, as several testified.
   The government presented an expert witness, Ben Bagdikian, a
45-year journalism veteran, Pulitzer Prize-winner and former
Washington Post managing editor, who scorned discussion of
imagination and creativity in reporters.
   ``If the work of the journalist is primarily invention and
imagination then that reporter is usually fired,'' he said.
   In a similar Labor Department overtime lawsuit against The
Washington Post, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled in January
1988 that 13 Post editors and reporters were artistic professionals.
   But Gesell made the ruling on a motion for summary judgment,
before a trial, and an appeals court since has thrown out his ruling
and ordered him to hold a trial.
   Devine could rule on whether all journalists are or are not
professionals, or he could decide to rule on the narrow question of
whether overtime pay is owed to the 51 reporters involved in the
Labor Department action and limit the professionalism question to
the Monitor staff or to newspapers in New Hampshire.

   A fired Coca-Cola driver who killed two of
his superiors and holed up in the company's office for seven hours
emerged this morning firing his guns and was fatally shot by police,
authorities said.
   John Wallace, 45, seized and released a hostage after shooting
the two men, who allegedly had fired him earlier Friday night, then
blockaded himself in the Coca-Cola West Metro Sales Center, said
Cobb County Police Chief Culver Johnson.
   He negotiated with police in this northern Atlanta suburb for
most of the night.
   Around 5 a.m. police fired tear gas into the building, a
distribution and sales office, and Wallace agreed to come out
without his guns, Johnson said.
   Instead, Wallace emerged with two guns and fired at police, he
said.
   ``They had no choice but to return the fire,'' Johnson said.
   Wallace was taken to Cobb General Hospital, where nursing
supervisor Linda Cole later said Wallace had died.
   Johnson said Wallace came to work at the plant near the Six Flags
Over Georgia amusement park around 10 p.m. and was told of his
dismissal. The reason for his firing was not immediately known.
   Witnesses told police that Wallace then went to clean out his
locker but returned with a handgun and fired on a gathering of
workers, shooting two of them.
   A caller who identified himself as Wallace telephoned WSB-TV in
Atlanta and told reporters he had shot two men. Police said
officials at the station acted as negotiators by telephone until
police took over.
   David Kenney, an associate producer at WSB, said the caller
described having worked 23 years for the company and said he shot
the plant manager who fired him and his supervisor.
   The victims were removed from the building within about an hour
of the shooting. One died at the scene and the other died later at a
hospital.
   Cobb County police identified the slain supervisors as Maurice
McCluskey of Decatur and Al Parsons. Their ages and Parsons' address
were not immediately available, said Ben Brannon, emergency operator
at the police department.
   Police said two other employees who were in the building managed
to escape.

   President P.W. Botha invited
Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned African National Congress leader, to
his official residence this week for a conversation, the government
announced today.
   It was the first time the two are known to have met and increased
speculation that Botha may free Mandela before leaving office in the
fall.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said Mandela, who is serving a
life prison term at the Victor Verster prison farm north of Cape
Town, paid a ``courtesy visit'' Wednesday to Tuynhuys, Botha's
official residence in the city center.
   Coetsee said no policy matters were debated and no negotiations
were conducted but that the two men ``availed themselves of the
opportunity to confirm their support for peaceful development in
South Africa.''
   The minister said the 45-minute conversation took place in a
``pleaseant spirt'' but the possibility of ``further steps or
meetings was not discussed during the occasion.'' Coetsee said he
was present during the visit.
   Normally, such a major announcement would not have been made on a
Saturday night. But a reporter for the independent South African
Press Association heard about the visit and called a spokesman for
Coetsee, who confirmed it.
   The announcement was carried by the news agency and subsequently
read on government-run television. Spokesmen for the justice
minister would not say why the meeting had been kept secret.
   Mandela, who will be 71 years old on July 18, has been in prison
since 1962. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 after being
convicted of sabotage and plotting to overthrow of the government.
   He is the nation's most respected black leader, and other leaders
of the black majority have refused to negotiate with the government
until he is freed.
   Botha, 73, is to retire after the September parliamentary
elections, and there has been widespread speculation he may free
Mandela before stepping down.
   In the past, Botha refused to consider freeing the ANC leader
unless he renounced violence, which Mandela refused to do unless the
government halted violence against blacks. However, during the past
year, Botha has dropped the renunciation requirement and said he
hopes it will be possible to free Mandela.
   The ANC is a primarily black guerrilla group fighting the
nation's white-led government. The group, based in Lusaka, Zambia,
is banned in South Africa.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs.
   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

   China on Saturday ordered a second Voice of
America reporter to leave the country and renewed verbal attacks on
the U.S. government-run station for its coverage of the crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters.
   Mark Hopkins, VOA's Boston bureau chief who was working
temporarily in China, said Beijing police summoned him to their
offices Saturday morning and gave him 72 hours to leave.
   He was the seventh Western reporter China has ordered to leave
since its army opened fire June 3-4 on student-led protesters and
crowds of supporters. The Chinese government says about 300 people
died in the crackdown, and it has criticized Western reports that up
to 3,000 died.
   Hopkins, 58, said police accused him of violating martial law
restrictions on reporting, spreading propaganda and violating the
terms of his tourist visa.
   Four of the other reporters expelled were on tourist visas. Two
were based in Beijing _ VOA's Beijing bureau chief, Alan Pessin, and
Associated Press correspondent John Pomfret.
   Hopkins said the actions against VOA were ``certainly part of
their antagonism toward the United States.'' Washington halted
military sales and high-level contacts following the crackdown.
   ``We reject all the allegations,'' said VOA's director, Richard
W. Carlson, in a telephone interview from Washington. ``They're mad
at the messenger.''
   China's official media have conducted a campaign of criticism
against VOA since June 4 and in recent days also have begun direct
attacks on the United States. The army newspaper, the Liberation
Army News, on Saturday described VOA as ``scandalous.''
   Also Saturday, newspapers reported the arrests of six more people
in connection with the protests, which began in Beijing in April and
spread nationwide.
   The Legal Daily said five leaders of an independent worker's
union were arrested in the northwestern city of Xian. The Beijing
Evening News said local police arrested a man for allegedly stealing
an army gun and setting vehicles on fire.
   After announcing more than 2,000 arrests nationwide, the media
have slowed reports of arrests to a trickle, although they are known
to be continuing. Although court dockets have been crammed with
protest-related cases, few sentences have been disclosed.
   The Shanghai-based Liberation Daily said seven people were given
sentences ranging from three years to 10 years for taking part in
the protests. Twenty-seven people have been executed since the
crackdown began.
   Chinese authorities moved to reassure anxious Hong Kong residents
they will be allowed to live under capitalism after the British
colony is returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the government
invited a group of prominent Hong Kong residents to Beijing to meet
with top party leaders, including the new party chief, Jiang Zemin.
The delegation is to include leaders of a committee that is drafting
a post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong.
   On Friday, Jiang told several visitors from Hong Kong and the
nearby Portuguese colony of Macao, which returns to China in 1999,
that China still pledged to allow the two colonies to keep their
capitalist systems for 50 years.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a similar statement Saturday but also
warned against any efforts by Hong Kong residents to ``attempt to
change the socialist system of the mainland'' or be used as a base
of subversion.
   Hong Kong groups donated money to the student protesters, and
since have helped smuggle fugitive dissidents out of China. Hundreds
of thousands of Hong Kong residents have joined in marches to
protest the Chinese crackdown.
   Chinese authorities warned mainland residents that they must not
relax their struggle against Western liberalism.
   ``Some counterrevolutionary rebel elements and serious criminals
have not been arrested and brought to justice,'' the Beijing Daily
quoted Education Minister Li Tieying as telling hundreds of
Communist Party's Youth League members. ``If we allow them to remain
at large, there will be no end to future troubles and the nation
won't have a day's peace.''

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists have won a preliminary round in
their fight to block construction of a second hotel on the
little-developed North Rim of the Grand Canyon.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Rosenblatt granted a preliminary
injunction Friday at the request of the Sierra Club Legal Defense
Fund, which claims the Park Service failed to conduct a proper
environmental impact study for the 200-room project.
   Sierra Club attorneys also argued the $5 million hotel would
detract from the experience of visiting the Grand Canyon.
   Park Service officials have said an environmental assessment they
performed was sufficient because the hotel site is located at an
already developed area, near the existing 200-room lodge, the only
lodging on the North Rim.
   The Park Service contended that it complied with legal
requirements and that the new hotel is needed because current
lodging doesn't meet demand.
   The preliminary injunction will allow construction of employee
housing by TW Recreational Services, the company contracted to build
the hotel.
   ``We're extremely pleased,'' said Fern Shepard, a lawyer for the
Sierra Club. ``We think that this is really an important decision
for the Grand Canyon.''
   ``We hope the Park Service will now go back and prepare an
environmental impact study and look to see if this project was
really even necessary in the first place,'' she said.
   ``I'm very dissapointed,'' said Gene Cohen, the attorney
representing TW Services, adding that the judge ``doesn't address
the arguements that we made.''
   ``He was concerned in the opinion that the 1984 contract was
executed before the environmental assesment was done. That seems to
have troubled the judge,'' Cohen said. ``As we understand it, there
is nothing wrong with that.''
   Jack Davis, superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park, said
Park Service officials would meet this week to decide whether to
appeal or go to trial on the Sierra Club suit.
   Cohen said the delay has already cost TW Services valuable time
because the North Rim, more than 7,000 feet above sea level, allows
only a brief summer building season and the hotel will take two
seasons to construct.

<HEAD>Army General Says U.S. Should Use Military Option In Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States should consider a
military solution to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power
in Panama, according to a commanding general in the U.S. Army's
Southern Command.
   ``I've been thinking more and more that the United States should
impose a military solution that would give this country an
opportunity to have a government that isn't criminal,'' Brig. Gen.
Marc A. Cisneros said in an interview.
   ``This is my personal opinion,'' Cisneros emphasized in the
interview Friday. ``This is a political decision I do not make. Any
U.S. military action is decided by the president.''
   Cisneros' U.S. Army South is part of the U.S. Southern Command
and includes Army forces charged with the defense of the Panama
Canal under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties of 1977.
   Cisneros was the Southern Command's chief of operations until two
weeks ago. In that job, he had frequent contact with officers of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   ``Noriega sees me as a definite threat,'' he said. ``Before, I
used to have some serious and frank discussions with some of the
officers and would tell them how Noriega was using them. I would
tell them `You are next.'''
   Cisneros often criticizes Noriega and the Defense Forces and he
is in turn attacked by the government media, which claim he has
betrayed his Mexican-American ancestry by becoming an Army general
and leading U.S. forces in Panama.
   The removal of the Panamanian general, Cisneros said, ``would
ensure democracy for this country. From the beginning I always
thought that Panamanians should do it, but if they do not, if they
do not have the desire, then they deserve him.''
   ``If we acted militarily,'' Cisneros said, ``from what we know
the majority of the Defense Forces will not fight.''
   ``But we would act only if there is a threat to U.S. interests,''
he said.
   ``Time is on our side,'' Cisneros said. ``Things will continue to
deteriorate.''
   The American general said he saw little chance of an internal
coup by disenchanted Panamanian officers.
   ``Some officers want us to act militarily, but those are the same
that probably tell Noriega they are loyal to him. They know their
fate depends on Noriega's survival. I do not see anyone there with
moral courage,'' he said.
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since a Miami
court last year indicted him on drug trafficking charges.
   On May 7, Noriega annulled presidential elections. International
observers say a slate led by the opposition's Guillermo Endara beat
Noriega's candidate, Carlos Duque, by at least a 3-1 margin.
   Noriega claims the U.S. government financed the opposition's
campaign and intervened to distort the results.
   Noriega also charges that the United States wants to renege on
the Panama Canal treaties that specify U.S. forces must leave Panama
on the last day of the year 1999, when Panama takes over total
administration of the canal.
   Under the treaties, the United States maintains nearly 12,000
soldiers in military bases here.

   Rev. George A. Stallings Jr., 41, will say Mass and perform
sacraments despite his suspension by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Washington, a spokesman for Stallings said.
   ``In the eyes of the Catholic Church it's without the consent of
the archbishop, but it's within the cultural needs of the
individuals who would want to worship here,'' Stallings spokesman
Hayden Blanc said in an interview Saturday.
   ``It is the intention of the congregation to stay within the
Catholic Church,'' Blanc said. The services of the Imani Temple,
named after the Swahili word for faith, will be held in a suburban
Washington high school auditorium.
   But as in a service last week that drew an estimated 3,000 people
to the grounds of Howard University, Stallings will include African
religious rites and add readings from black authors to the standard
scripture and sacraments, Blanc said.
   Stallings has said the new congregation is necessary because the
Catholic Church has failed ``cultural and spiritual needs'' of its
black parishioners. Stallings has also charged the church with
racism.
   He has said he wants to see formation of an African-American
Catholic Rite, which would still recognize the authority of the pope
but have more control over its liturgy and other matters.
   The church is not contemplating any further discipline for now, a
spokesman for the Washington Archdiocese said.
   ``He is a suspended priest ... The church is not going to stand
behind anything he does sacramentally,'' said Rev. William Lori,
secretary to Washington Cardinal James A. Hickey. ``Obviously, a
suspended priest is not supposed to say Mass in public or in
private.''
   Hickey suspended Stallings last week, after the service at
Howard. The church has since adopted a ``wait and see'' response,
Lori said.
   ``We're not going to be rushed into anything, and we're asking
him to reconcile,'' he said.
   Lori said there are no meetings between Stallings and church
officials scheduled. He has said there are no plans to excommunicate
Stallings now.
   ``Obviously Imani Temple is just an infant. ... We're not going
to rush into any kind of rash judgement, and we don't regard what
Father Stallings says as the final word,'' Lori said.
   Stallings has said he ``cannot be excommunicated from God,'' even
if the church moves to strip him of his ordination.
   Lori said the church ``cannot guarantee'' Mass and communion
observed at Imani Temple would be recognized elsewhere in the
Catholic Church. But he said there will be no church action against
practicing Catholics who attend Stallings' services. ``One service
at Imani Temple does not erase a lifetime of Catholicism,'' Lori
said.
   Stallings spokesman Blanc said he expected more than 1,000 people
at the 11 a.m. service Sunday. He said response to the new chuch
from black Catholics has been positive.
   ``From the papers you would think there has been so much
opposition, there really isn't. As far as the phones are concerned,
once in a blue moon we may get someone who has a question,'' Blanc
said.
   Priests from many of the area's 40 predominately black parishes
have issued statements supporting Hickey and the church.
   Lori said many of those churches offer so-called gospel Masses,
like those Stallings delivered during 12 years as pastor of a black
church here.
   ``The church has said racism is a sin. ... Father Stallings is
not the first one to make that charge and he's not making it to a
church that isn't listening,'' Hickey spokesman Lori said.
   ``The church is not upset at Father Stallings because he points
out the need for better ministry to black Catholics ... The problem
is that he is going about it in the wrong way,'' Lori said.

   The army killed 20 Shining Path guerrillas in
two raids in the coca-growing jungle region northeast of the
capital, the government said Saturday.
   One soldier was wounded in the operation, carried out Thursday
with ground troops and helicopters in the state of Huanuco,
according to the report.
   The state of Huanuco encompasses most of the Upper Huallaga
Valley, the world's richest coca-growing region. The government has
said the Shining Path operates in league with drug traffickers in
the area, allowing them to move their products in exchange for cash.
   In the first rebel encounter, an army patrol surprised a camp of
70 guerrillas near La Morada, 185 miles northeast of Lima, killing
15 rebels.
   The army, with helicopter support, then attacked another camp in
the area, killing five rebels, officials said.
   President Alan Garcia has said the threat of ``radical and
violent communism'' is greater in Peru than anywhere else in Latin
America.
   The Shining Path, a Mao-inspired group started by a Marxist
university professor in the early 1970s, took up arms against Peru's
elected government in 1980.
   The insurgency began in the highland state of Ayacucho, 235 miles
southeast of Lima, but has spread through most of the highlands and
northern jungle regions.
   The government has said nearly 15,000 people have died in the
9-year-old uprising, including soldiers, police, guerrillas and
government officials. Most of the dead, however, have been peasants
killed in the cross fire between the army and the rebels.

   Big-screen movie magic returned to this
small Indiana town for the first time in six years, sending
couch-potato residents to the box office in droves.
   ``Portland's been dead for so long, now it's starting to come
alive,'' said Betty Miller, clerk-treaurer of the town 45 miles
south of Fort Wayne.
   Michael Volpe, an engineer, and Charles H. Miller, a dentist,
were tired of driving to Fort Wayne or 30 miles southwest to Muncie
whenever they wanted to see a movie.
   And for Volpe, who keeps a log of more than 2,500 movies he's
seen, that has meant several trips a week.
   ``It's not unusual for me and my lady to go up to Fort Wayne or
Muncie and see at least two movies and sometimes three in an
afternoon,'' he said.
   So the men teamed up to bring the big-screen back to 7,000
residents who have gone without a theater since July 1983. That's
when Portland's only indoor theater was destroyed by a fire that
killed its live-in projectionist.
   Shortly before that, a fire closed down Portland's drive-in
theater.
   The new movie house, the art-deco Ritz, is housed in a
100-year-old converted furniture store with 14 apartments on the top
floor. The theater had its grand opening Friday night with a
$10-per-person benefit featuring a 1936 film of Portland's
centennial. More than 200 tickets were sold in advance.
   But the weekend bill, which included a Friday afternoon showing,
offered jazzier fare, including the films ``Lethal Weapon 2'' and
``K-9.''
   Mitch Harter, 14, was excited at the prospect of a day at the
Ritz.
   ``There's not much to do in town for young people except to
cruise and get in trouble,'' said the boy, who rode his bicycle up
and down Meridian Street waiting to attend the afternoon show.

   Four flat tires in one day didn't keep a
bright red 1924 Bentley from roaring across the finish line with
just seconds to spare in a race from Virginia to Disneyland.
   Dick Burdick drove the classic car from coast to coast to take
first place and $50,000 Friday in the Interstate Batteries Great
American Race.
   The Rosanky, Texas, resident had finished second in the 12-day,
3,500-mile road rally the previous two years.
   ``We finally broke the spell and did it,'' said Burdick, who has
participated in the antique car race for seven consecutive years.
   ``The most frustrating time was the day with all the flat
tires,'' he said. ``It's a rally and you can't rally if you don't
have four wheels under you.''
   The flat tires were between Santa Fe, N.M., and Phoenix.
   Burdick and his navigator, Wayne Bell of Lake Oswego, Ore.,
nudged out Alan Travis, who was last year's winner.
   Travis, from Phoenix, and his navigator, Wayne Stanfield of
Tustin, Calif., drove a 1916 Egge Machine Co. Mitchell Roadster.
   In all, the race featured 113 cars made before World War II. It
began in Norfolk, Va., on June 26.
   The competition, which usually runs from West to East, was a
little tougher this year because it started in the East and headed
West, leaving the desert crossing for the final grueling days.
   In previous years, the desert was the first leg of the journey
``and once you get across the Great Divide, it's all downhill from
there,'' said Sam Cole, one of the organizers of Greatrace, Ltd.

   Talk show host Pat Sajak says he's
content with his new late night talk show on CBS and tries not to
dwell on ratings.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, everything's going fine,'' he said in
a telephone interview. ``I'm sure there are those who'd like to see
us doing better, but I'm satisfied with the progress we've made and
I'm proud of the show we're putting on the air.''
   ``From the beginning, we took care not to play any numbers games
and I didn't go into this with any numbers in mind,'' he said
without elaborating.
   Sajak, a former TV weatherman in Nashville, said he believes his
show has been hurt in its competition with NBC's ``The Tonight
Show'' because it is delayed 30 minutes by many stations that show
the syndicated ``Entertainment Tonight.''
   ``When you take into account that in about half the big markets
we're delayed a half hour, it's amazing we're doing as well as we
are,'' he said.

   Singer Tom Jones is the target of a paternity
suit filed by a woman who claims she spent two nights with him two
years ago.
   ``There is no question that Tom Jones is the baby's father. No
question whatsoever,'' said attorney Raoul Felder, who represents
Katherine Berkery.
   Ms. Berkery, 27, says Jones fathered the child when they spent
two nights together at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in October 1987. The
baby, Jonathan Jones Berkery, was born June 27, 1988.
   Attorneys for the Welsh singer have charged Ms. Berkery was a
prostitute and has lied about her background. Jones has not appeared
in Manhattan Family Court during the proceeding.
   Jones recently scored a hit single with a remake of Prince's
``Kiss.'' He is best known for his singles ``It's Not Unusual'' and
``She's a Lady.''

   Principal Joe Clark said Saturday that his
steel-fisted reign over the inner-city high school he ran for eight
years apparently is over, thanks to hostile town officials.
   The school board suspended him for five days in March after
scantily clad dancers performed at a school assembly while he was
out of town. He blamed the suspension on politicians who envied the
spotlight he enjoyed, a spotlight that has included the cover of
Time magazine and a Hollywood movie.
   He said Saturday that he probably will formalize his departure
after he uses up his vacation days.
   ``The City Council is questioning how I have 300 days of vacation
coming to me,'' Clark said at a news conference. ``I haven't had a
vacation for 12 years.''
   Clark, released Saturday from Newark Beth Israel Medical Center
following heart surgery six weeks ago, said his biggest
accomplishment was showing that ``black and Hispanic students in the
inner city can behave.''
   ``Educating them is another story,'' he added, because ``when a
student comes to my school with a third-grade education, I can't
move him up to a 12th-grade level in a few years.''
   His no-nonsense approach to education was symbolized by a
baseball bat and bullhorn he wielded during patrols of the halls at
Paterson's Eastside High School. His efforts, which included
expelling and suspending dozens of students he said were
troublemakers and drug dealers, were depicted in the movie ``Lean on
Me.''
   Doctors will allow him to give a lecture tour beginning in
September. Clark said he already has about 40 dates lined up at
$7,000 a speech _ ``not bad for a ghetto boy.''

   Jerry Dunphy, most-recognized anchor in the
southern California television market, is moving to KHJ-TV and will
lead the station's new three-hour newscast next year, KHJ and the
Walt Disney Studio announced.
   Dunphy will leave KABC-TV, his home for 14 years, upon
finalization of contract details, officials at Disney-owned KHJ said
Friday.
   At three hours, KHJ's evening newscast will be the longest in the
United States, said station spokeswoman Andi Sporkin. The weekday
broadcast is set to debut in January.
   KHJ declined to release Dunphy's contract terms, except to say it
was a multiyear deal. Dunphy was reported to have been paid in
excess of $800,000 at KABC.
   The white-haired Dunphy has often been described as one of the
models for the character of Tex Baxter of the ``Mary Tyler Moore

   Thirty-eight years ago, Charles Tasnadi left
his native Hungary on his belly, scrabbling a tortuous path to
freedom through frozen minefields and waves of barbed wire. He will
return, Tuesday, on Air Force One.
   As George Bush pays the first visit to Budapest by an American
president, Tasnadi, 64, an Associated Press photographer, will be
with him to capture that moment on film. He will record an even more
special moment in his heart.
   ``When the military band strikes up the Star Spangled Banner
during the arrival ceremonies at the Kossuth statue (a monument to
the Hungarian hero who fought the Hapsburgs) in Budapest, I will
remember a small boy scout standing at that same statue,'' he said.
   And ``I will also remember that following World War II, my church
choir was forbidden by the Stalinist (puppet) regime to sing the
U.S. national anthem to thank America for its postwar help.''
   Tasnadi was just shy of his 26th birthday when he and his
sweetheart, Maria, seized upon the first heavy snowfall of the
1950-51 winter to seek a new life. A championship skier, he
concocted a story about heading for the slopes, sharing the truth
only with his mother, who, by design, would report him missing two
days later.
   Joining a group of six other adults and two children _ one of
whom Tasnadi carried on his shoulders during the final, nightlong
leg across the border _ the couple slipped into Austria, eluded more
Soviet guards in the 50-mile Soviet zone of that nation, and made it
to Salzburg several days later.
   They nearly didn't. The other child, carried by another man, had
to be knocked unconscious to keep it from crying and alerting the
guards. ``And it was so miserably cold,'' Tasnadi recalls. ``Twice I
fell through the ice up to my chest. I couldn't even feel it. When
we got to a house on the Austrian side, I kicked off my brand new
shoes so they would dry out. When I woke up, they were so shriveled
up I couldn't use them.''
   He and Maria were quickly married in Salzburg, but their dream of
raising a family in the United States was at first stymied by
immigration authorities. So they moved to Venezuela instead, where
Tasnadi's newspaper photography eventually drew the AP's attention
and an invitation to join the news service in the United States. He
was assigned to the Washington bureau in 1964, and has worked there
since.
   Twice over the years Maria has returned to Hungary, but Tasnadi,
torn by conflicting emotions, kept postponing the trip. His mother,
now deceased, had long since emigrated to the United States. ``I
finally said, `OK, this is the year I go,'' he said. ``Then, it
wasn't two weeks before I got the assignment to go with the
president of the United States.'' Maria will stay behind.
   Prior assignment have taken him to the Soviet Union, Cuba and
other communist nations, and the Castro government has accorded him
several unusual photo privileges out of respect for his work.
``Since I became an American citizens, I try to be very polite to
the Soviet bloc,'' he said. ``I want to be sure of my objectivity.
I've never tried to make a bad picture of any communist leader. ...
The only time I talk politics is when I vote.''
   But Tasnadi's love of the United States is legion among
Washington circles. An American flag adorns his mailbox, and despite
his courtly manners ``he will fight you if you say anything bad
about his country or his flag,'' says Toby Massey, Washington
assistant chief of bureau for newsphotos.
   Massey recalled that when Tasnadi was about to take his
citizenship test in 1968, ``Charlie was a nervous wreck. He studied
so hard, and had everybody giving him spot quizzes.'' Another AP
photographer, Henry Burroughs, accompanied Tasnadi to the courtroom
as his sponsor. As it turned out, said Massey, the judge was a
college roommate of Burroughs _ and didn't ask Tasnadi a single
question.
   Other anecdotes abound about the Americanization of Tasnadi. When
he was first assigned to cover a baseball game, he quickly surmised
that the best action occurred around second base. So he promptly
walked onto the field, and took his position just feet from the bag.
   At a professional football game, a perplexed Tasnadi kept
glancing skyward as he paced the sidelines. When a colleague asked
him why, Tasnadi pointed to the ``ball on'' section of the
scoreboard and said, ``I can't find the balloon.''
   And during a national political convention, Tasnadi's assignment
editor ordered him to relieve a colleague, Ray Stubblebine, who had
taken ill on one of the photo towers in the hall. ``Go over there
and spell Stubblebine,'' the editor demanded. Tasnadi didn't move.
``Damn it, Charlie, I said go over there and spell Stubblebine,''
the editor barked.
   ``I'm sorry,'' said Tasnadi. ``If I can't spell it here, I can't
spell it over there.''
   Professionally, Tasnadi gets most things right. He was won
several White House Press Photographers awards, and counts several
presidents among his friends. Once, in Vail, Colo., he got a knock
on his door at 2 a.m. ``Mr. Tasnadi,'' said his caller, ``the
president would be honored if you could ski with him tomorrow.''
   Riding up the chairlift with Gerald R. Ford, Tasnadi recalled,
``I thought, `My God, if anybody would have told me when I was
waiting, with that little boy in my arms, to cross that minefield.
that one day I would be riding up a mountain with the president of
the United States ... Oh, my God.''
   Despite the trend toward more political tolerance in Hungary,
Tasnadi still confesses some apprehension about his emotional
readiness for his first return to his homeland. ``My worst fear,''
he said, tears welling in his eyes, ``is an evening at an old
restaurant in Budapest, with a glass of Tokay served to the strains
of violins. That could prove to be disastrous.''
   Asked what picture he would like to shoot most in Hungary, he
replied: ``There are so many. But when I see that statue of Lajos
Kossuth ... before the war, I was chosen as one of two little boy
scouts who would go there on weekends and stand at attention for two
hours, as honor guard. And now, the president will go there. When I
see that statue again ...''
   His tears finished the sentence.

   In what once was her mother's living room,
Doris Stone Jones supervises the business office of the Magazine
Telephone Co., where customers using the 765 lines _ the town has
799 residents _ are greeted by their first names.
   Three generations of Stones have kept the telephone lines humming
in this western Arkansas community for half a century.
   Mrs. Jones remembers how, as a child, she could hear operators at
the parlor switchboard and neighborly chatter on party lines.
   Her brother, Hank Stone, monitors the constantly clicking
switches in the narrow red-brick technical building next door, while
his sons _ Denny, Chris and Vic _ take care of outside wiring.
   Chris' wife, Cheryl, punches billing information into the
company's brand-new, and only, computer terminal.
   The Magazine Telephone Co. is listed by the Public Service
Commission as the second-smallest of the state's 30 telephone
companies.
   ``In a small town, you get a lot of personal service,'' said Mrs.
Jones, 61, whose parents, Henry and Anna Stone, bought the company
in August 1939. ``Our family is so telephone-oriented, our family
reunion was a telephone convention in Oklahoma City.''
   In 1939, the company had 10 customers, two pay phones and
hay-baling wire for emergency repairs. During World War II, students
worked part time as operators; a full-time vacation relief operator
earned a dime an hour.
   On election nights, Anna Stone, now retired, stayed up late to
relay returns to the county seat at Paris, 15 miles away.
   In the 1950s, lines were run to nearby Waveland, Blue Mountain
and Sugar Grove, and the company went to dial service. Twenty-two
customers once crowded a single party line to Waveland. By 1970, the
company had two exchanges _ 947 and 969.
   Mrs. Jones said technical advances haven't hampered the
neighborly nature of the operation, where basic service costs $8.31
a month. The family understood when one customer, short on cash,
dropped her wedding ring into the night depository slot. The ring
was returned, Mrs. Jones said.
   The business office, replete with color portraits of 10
grandchildren, offers telephone directories published by the Contel
phone company, where Hank Stone works during the day as a senior
technician.
   Magazine's listings are included in the Contel book because it's
too expensive to publish a local directory, Mrs. Jones said. The
Stones are frugal in other ways, too, including the avoidance of
such modern business practices as taking out loans.
   ``We don't borrow,'' she said. ``Everything you see is ours.''
   Hank's sons, who all began full-time at the job at the age of 18
or so, took a lunch break at the business office the other day,
after an early start to repair lines knocked out by storms during
the night.
   ``I was out till 11:30 getting the phone back up at the ranger
station in Waveland,'' said Chris, 29.
   Added Denny, 33, ``One came to my house last night and left a
message about service being out. They're back up now.''
   ``It's a living. It's a job,'' said Vic, 31. ``We ain't getting
rich, but we live comfortable.''
   All three sons learned their work from their dad, helping out
during summer vacations before they began full time. The education
came in handy when a chicken feed truck driver forgot to lower his
boom and tore down a mile of cable on a Fourth of July, recalled
Chris.
   ``Yep, we work holidays if we need to,'' he said. ``And we did
get to shoot fireworks later that night.''
   Don Dickens, chief of the Magazine volunteer fire department,
praises the company's cooperation.
   ``When there's a fire, you dial 8400 and it rings 20 different
telephones at 20 different firemen's houses. And everybody just
picks up the phone and finds out the location,'' Dickens said.
``It's like a conference call, and it works great.''
   The firemen's phones also are rigged with a button that sets off
a public siren, Dickens said.
   ``Now that's telephone service,'' he said.
   Postmaster Phyllis Webster agrees.
   ``It's small, yes, but I don't have any complaints about the
telephone company,'' she said. ``I'm comfortable with it, and it
suits the way we live here just really well.''

   American marching bands and majorettes strutted
their stuff Saturday in central Paris in a lively U.S. salute to the
200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   Several thousand people crowded around City Hall and the
surrounding side streets to catch a glimpse of the plumed hats,
fluttering flags and flying batons of the 600 performers.
   The daylong U.S. homage to the bicentennial kicks off a week of
celebrations, culminating Friday on Bastille Day, the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison.
   President Bush will be among about 30 world leaders in town for
the parades and fireworks, followed by the annual economic summit of
the world's seven largest industrial democracies.
   The Montana Centennial Band, in white cowboy hats and blue jeans,
led the short parade to cheers from crowds along the avenue.
   The Virginia Military Institute's band, in plumed hats and
gray-and-white uniforms, was next down the Avenue Victoria, followed
by the Marching Panthers of James B. Dudley High School in
Greensboro, N.C., the North Springs (Ga.) High School band and the
Lawrence Central (Ind.) High School band, led by flagbearers waving
the American, French and Indiana colors.
   Marching bands are a rarity in France and are considered
quintessentially American, but the most exotic spectacle came last,
with the 28 members of the Touch of Kyle Twirling Club of Kalamazoo,
Mich., spinning their batons, flags and pink rifles.
   The event's announcer, addressing the crowd over speakers mounted
at City Hall, described baton-twirling as ``this very American art,
which consists of marching in time to the music, spinning and
tossing the little batons while executing all sorts of arabesques.''
   The young Americans are participating in a variety of events
marking the bicentennial around France.
   ``I was really proud of our school that we got chosen,'' said
Andrea Varrone, a clarinet player in the North Springs band. ``We've
been touring and shopping. It's been a lot of fun.''
   The Virginia Military Institute band, from Lexington, Va., played
earlier in the day at the inauguration of a renovated square
honoring the United States.
   It is to lead a civic parade in the city of Vendome, 100 miles
southwest of Paris, commemorating ties between Virginia and France.
The band members plan to tour the Ecole Polytechnique, the historic
French military engineering academy that served as the model for the
Virginia Military Institute, which celebrates its 150th anniversary
this year.

<HEAD>20,000 Gather to Debate, Regain Momentum in Rights Fight</HEAD>

   From San Francisco and Dallas, from small towns in
Mississippi and Michigan, about 20,000 NAACP members are gathering
for their annual convention to debate, renew acquaintances and
regain momentum.
   The nation's oldest and largest civil rights group opens its
annual convention in Detroit on Sunday.
   ``It's the people from the various communities around the country
who set the positions. That's the beauty of this organization,''
said the Rev. Richard Dockery of Dallas, southwest regional director
of the NAACP.
   Annual dues were 50 cents when Dockery, 65, joined the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1939. He lived
in Mobile, Ala., ``deep in the heart of Dixie, where you had to have
courage, or a shotgun.''
   In the years since, dues have grown to $10 a year. But now as
then, Dockery said, the NAACP is the most important voice for black
Americans.
   ``It's the organization for our people,'' he said before leaving
for Detroit last week.
   The NAACP, which claims 500,000 members nationwide, was founded
in 1909 by W.E.B. DuBois and others.
   Over the years, it has won many battles, including desegregation
of the military, schools and public facilities, voting and other
civil rights. Some, including the effort to overcome economic
inequality between the races, it has not. Other fights that appeared
won now are in doubt, said Benjamin Hooks, NAACP executive director
since 1977.
   A series of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions ``just emasculate
the civil rights laws,'' Hooks said. ``In fact, it's going to get a
lot worse before it gets better.''
   ``It's a sad fact that we're still about the same thing we were
when we were founded in 1909 _ eliminating all forms of racial
discrimination. Racism, sexism are alive and well.''
   Despite the grim appraisal, the spirits of Hooks and other
delegates appeared joyful on the eve of the 80th annual convention.
He said the Supreme Court decisions have boosted interest in the
organization, particularly among young black professionals.
   For many members, the gathering offers a chance to see old
friends, share experiences and regain a spirit of hope, said Lulann
Sapp McGriff, San Francisco chapter president.
   McGriff, a member for 13 years and former national staff member,
said she looked forward to seeing the 1,300 young people
participating in the NAACP's annual ``black Olympics'' competition
in science, humanities and the arts.
   The ACT-SO competition, short for Afro-Academic, Cultural,
Technological and Scientific Olympics, will award $150,000 in
scholarships.
   ``For me, that is the highlight of the convention, seeing the
black young people showing their scholarship,'' McGriff said.
``You've got poets, writers, musicians _ it's a phenomenal thing to
see.''
   In addition to debating resolutions on topics ranging from AIDS
to urban decay, the delegates will get a chance to hear from a
parade of politicians, as well as an assortment of entertainers.
   Vice President Dan Quayle speaks Wednesday and 1988 Democratic
presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson on Thursday. Also appearing are
two members of President Bush's Cabinet _ Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp and Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Other speakers include United Auto Workers union President Owen
Bieber, national Democratic Chairman Ron Brown, Michigan Gov. James
Blanchard and Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, one of the nation's most
powerful black leaders after 15 years at the helm of the nation's
sixth-largest city.
   Film maker Spike Lee, whose movie ``Do the Right Thing'' has
sparked a debate over race relations, and television talk show host
Oprah Winfrey also will appear.
   The displays of youthful talent and celebrity appearances, along
with the chance to swap stories with old friends, help lift the
spirits of NAACP activists engaged in the long, lonely battle for
racial justice, Hooks said.
   ``It gives them the renewed vigor to continue the fight,'' he
said.

<HEAD>World Youth Festival Ends With Crowd Of 150,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   About 150,000 spectators attended Saturday's closing
ceremony of a weeklong international youth festival in the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang, the communist government's official
news agency reported.
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung was among those attending the
ceremony, which was ``enveloped in a festive mood,'' said the report
monitored in Tokyo.
   The 13th World Festival of Youth and Students was the largest
international gathering staged by the government.
   Spectators from 180 countries filled the 150,000 seats of the new
May Day Stadium, where many of the festival's events were held, the
Korean Central News Agency report said.
   It described the event as ``a complete success'' that ``marked a
brilliant chapter in the history of the youth movement of the
world.''
   The festival, which began July 1, brought people from mostly
socialist nations together for athletic shows, photography and art
exhibitions, songfests, plays and discussions on various
``anti-imperialist'' themes.
   However, police earlier during the festival seized Danish and
Finnish human rights banners, and some European delegates accused
North Korea of using the gathering for self-promotion.
   The Danish banner called for human rights in North Korea, while
Finland's banner protested the Pyongyang government's refusal to
allow the rights group Amnesty International to attend.
   The Finn delegation reversed its decision to drop out of the
festival after North Korea apologized and said two Amnesty
International representatives would be given visas to attend.
Anmesty has cited rights violations in North Korea.
   The festival, the 13th since 1947, was last held in 1985 in
Moscow.

<HEAD>Harvard Tradition Includes Restricted Library Collection of Books
About Sex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A picture book of Catherine the Great's
lewd furniture, a Cold War expose on communist sexual practices and
pristine copies of Playboy can be found among the 10.2 million tomes
at Harvard University.
   But to see them, you need to find the man who holds the key to
the XR collection.
   Down a steep stairway at Harvard's Widener library and behind a
heavy copper door that stays locked is the collection that makes
Edward Doctoroff, the man with the key, practically blush.
   But if he's red in the face, it's not because of the erotic
contents of the XR books and magazines, but because the whole idea
the locked collection is so old-fashioned, and because the
collection stopped growing years ago.
   ``It's a dead collection,'' said the succinct Doctoroff, head of
circulation services at Widener, the chief repository of the written
word at Harvard.
   ``XR'' does not stand for ``X-rated.'' The ``X'' means the books
are one of 20 categories of unusual books _ miniature books are
another such category _ and the ``R'' stands for restricted.
   Marion Schoon, chief of the library's reference collection,
believes as Doctoroff does that it's just an oddity of history that
the assortment of 1,000 books that analyze, philosophize, wax poetic
about and poke fun at sex are still housed separately, under lock
and key.
   ``This is sort of a remnant,'' she said.
   The XR collection was only actively assembled and added to for
less than 30 years. But the prudishness that was still the norm
three decades ago had nothing to do with its separate status _
librarians were concerned about the books getting lost.
   ``It was before my time, but apparently in the '50s, early '60s,
there was a sociology professor who found a lot of the books for his
course were not available,'' said Ms. Schoon. The books on the
reading list that concerned sex were missing from Widener's shelves,
so a restricted collection was created.
   ``Playboy had to be in there,'' she added, ``because they tended
to lose the centerfold.''
   But librarians quit labeling books XR sometime in the '70s, she
said. There was simply no need. Copies of the same books are now
found in the general stacks but no one bothers to steal them or cut
out their favorite pictures. Just over the road in Harvard Square
newsstands sell plenty of magazines to satisfy the salacious scholar.
   And Playboy is on microfiche.
   Not much traffic goes on in the XR nowadays; a week can go by
with fewer than five volumes checked out.
   So why continue to lock up ``Sexual Behavior in the Communist
World: An Eyewitness Report of Life and Love and the Human Condition
Behind the Iron Curtain'' with ``5,000 Adult Sex Words &amp; Phrases,''
and ``The Passions and Lechery of Catherine the Great''? Not to
mention better known literary ventures in sex by D.H. Lawrence,
``Lady Chatterley's Lover''; Henry Miller, ``Tropic of Cancer''; and
William S. Burroughs, ``Naked Lunch''?
   It's just lack of money, Ms. Schoon said. The XR collection would
vanish if there were resources to do all the work needed to disperse
the books throughout Harvard's vast library and change all the
records, Ms. Schoon said.
   ``It's sort of like a spiderweb, cataloguing. Pulling all the
cards. It's very labor intensive,'' Ms. Schoon said.
   The library is plenty busy adding 50,000 to 60,000 new volumes
every year. Reorganizing things for 1,000 books could slow things
down, Ms. Schoon said.
   So the XR collection stays as it is, a quaint memento of a time
when sex needed to be kept under lock and key.

<TEXT>
   The Marxist government reported its
troops backed by tanks and artillery further advanced toward the
Pakistani border Saturday, destroying guerrilla bases and killing 81
insurgents.
   U.S.-backed guerrillas based in Pakistan claimed to have
recaptured a garrison near the eastern city of Jalalabad that they
lost Thursday.
   Also Saturday, government-run Radio Kabul said guerrillas blasted
the capital with a barrage of rockets, killing eight civilians and
wounding four.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the Afghan
army backed by a tank regiment advanced two miles and was 32 miles
from the border.
   ``Our brave army forced the opponents to retreat, and we are
advancing to destroy more bases of the enemies,'' he said on the
fourth day of a government offensive.
   Amani said government troops were in complete control of
Jalalabad and surrounding hills, giving them a strategic advantage
over the rebels.
   ``We are fortifying the area with heavy weapons and we plan to
march further,'' he said.
   The spokesman said Afghan government troops also carried out
search and destroy operations in about half a dozen villages
Saturday in Nangarhar province, whose capital is Jalalabad.
   The troops seized a large quantity of weapons including 2,400
mines, one tank, three armored personnel carriers and bags of
explosives, he said.
   Jalalabad, on the main route from Kabul to Pakistan, is 75 miles
east of the Afghan capital and 45 miles west of the border.
   Moslem guerrillas in Pakistan claimed they stalled the government
offensive Friday after losing the strategic Samarkhiel garrison on
the outskirts of Jalalabad. On Saturday, the guerrillas' Afghan
Information and Documentation Center based in Peshawar and the
Afghan News Agency both reported the insurgents recaptured the
garrison.
   Fasle Akbar of the information center said two Soviet-made Scud
missiles landed near the border town of Torkham on Saturday, killing
10 guerrillas and injuring 25. However, he said guerrillas shot down
a government fighter jet and helicopter gunship on Friday.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed of the Afghan News Agency said the
guerrillas, known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, were
allowing government troops to advance.
   ``Mujahedeen will not block their way,'' said Saeed, adding
guerrillas skilled at hit-and-run tactics would be well-placed in
mountain hideouts around Torkham, where a key guerrilla base is
located at the foot of the Khyber Pass.
   The guerrillas have tried since March to capture Jalalabad, the
country's fifth-largest city. It would provide them a seat for a
guerrilla government they formed in Pakistan.
   Lt. Gen. Manoky Mangal, military governor of Nangarhar province,
on Friday said at least 2,000 insurgents had been killed and 4,000
wounded in the operation around Jalalabad, and gave government
casualties as 26 dead.
   Both sides customarily exaggerate enemy losses and minimize their
own.
   The Moslem insurgents attacked Jalalabad on March 7 in their
first major assault after the withdrawal of Soviet military forces
from Afghanistan was completed Feb. 15.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to back the
government. The withdrawal was mandated under a U.S.-mediated accord.

<HEAD>Liberia's Defense Minister Charged in Ritual Murder</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with details, background. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberia's defense minister, his wife and
seven other people have been accused of slaying a young policeman
and using his heart and other organs in black magic rituals.
   The case against Maj. Gen. Gray Allison, his wife, Angeline, and
the others was outlined in a three-page statement issued Friday by
the justice minister of this West African nation, Jenkins Scott.
   Allison was under house arrest and his wife was said to be in
detention and cooperating with authorities.
   Scott said all would be formally charged with murder, with the
defense minister to be tried on an unspecified date before a
court-martial.
   Allison, defense minister since 1982, also had been serving as
chairman of the executive board of the country's Joint Chiefs of
Security.
   President Samuel Doe called the case ``a sinful act.''
   In his statement, Scott said Allison and his wife planned the
murder in a series of meetings with the other defendants between
March 28 and 30.
   Allison ``and his wife asked the persons present to provide him a
person to be murdered and parts extracted to be used as sacrifice in
rituals intended to promote his own selfish and greedy desire,'' the
statement alleged.
   ``Following the said meetings, one of the suspects, Lt. Col. Joe
Leesolee, pursuant to the plan and the discussion held with the
Allisons, made available the living body of Patrolman Melvin Pyne,
to be murdered and parts extracted therefrom, in satisfaction of the
general's and his wife's request.''
   Pyne's beheaded body was found in early April on a railroad track
near the general's home. Police said at the time he had been the
victim of a ritual murder, with his death made to appear as if he
had been struck by a train.
   Asked the motive behind the murder, Scott told reporters, ``The
motive is not important because we do not prosecute on motive.''
   The justice minister said six or seven people had admitted their
involvement in the slaying, but he refused to name anyone other than
the Allisons and Leesolee.
   Ritual murders are reported several times a year in West and
Central Africa.

<HEAD>Burmese Opposition Leader Will Continue Campaign of Speeches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's main opposition leader, Aung San
Suu Kyi, said Saturday that despite ``veiled threats'' by the
military government, she will continue her speeches that have drawn
large crowds in Rangoon recently.
   The charismatic Suu Kyi, 44-year-old daughter of assassinated
independence hero Aung San, has garnered widespread popular support
since emerging at the head of last year's thwarted uprising for
democracy. Her outspoken condemnations are unprecedented in a
country cowed by years of authoritarian repression.
   Suu Kyi said she planned to deliver more speeches in Rangoon on
Monday, in spite of the government's demand that the opposition
leader end what officials decribe as her ``confrontational''
approach.
   The main target in Suu Kyi's repeated denunciations of military
rule is strongman Ne Win, who held Burma in an iron grip for 26
years until officially retiring a year ago.
   Suu Kyi, general secretary of the National League for Democarcy,
charges Ne Win continues to manipulate the government of Gen. Saw
Maung from the wings.
   A spokeswoman for her party claimed up to 1,000 members of the
league have been arrested since the military took power last
September.
   Speaking from Rangoon in a telephone interview, Suu Kyi accused
Saw Maung of threatening opposition groups when he spoke at a rare
press conference Wednesday.
   ``Two things emerged during Saw Maung's speech,'' Suu Kyi said.
``The first is that he has shown that he does not believe in
dialogue and the second was a veiled threat of force.''
   ``This is exactly the way Ne Win has always reacted when faced
with any kind of opposition,'' Suu Kyi said. ``This is why we are
convinced that Ne Win is still pulling the strings from behind Saw
Maung.''
   Ne Win, now 78, is held responsible for ordering the killings of
protesters during protests for political change last year. Troops
under Saw Maung killed at least hundreds when assuming power Sept 18.
   At his press conference, Saw Maung insisted Ne Win took no part
in national politics, but said: ``We are all here today because of
him, he taught us like a parent.''
   The pace of political dissent has quickened in Burma in the past
few weeks as large crowds have massed in Rangoon in defiance of a
10-month-old martial law order forbidding more than five people to
assemble.
   The government, however, has allowed the formation of political
parties and promised free elections next year.
   On Wednesday, more than 10,000 people rallied to hear Suu Kyi
speak in what diplomats said was the largest political gathering
since the army seized power. Diplomats said she addressed more large
crowds Thursday.
   On Saturday, residents said large crowds attended the funeral in
Rangoon of Mahn Win Maung, the last president of a
democratically-elected government in Burma. He died Monday at the
age of 73.
   Mahn Win Maung was elected president of Prime Minister U Nu's
government in 1957. The government was ousted by Ne Win's military
coup in 1962.

<HEAD>Two New Airbus Planes Grounded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Airbus Industrie A320 aircraft recently
purchased by Northwest Airlines were grounded after engines stalled
during pre-flight runway taxiing, a spokesman said.
   The high-technology planes were voluntarily grounded Friday by
the Minnesota-based Northwest until the engine's manufacturers and
the airline can determine the cause of the problem and correct it,
said Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen.
   Northwest has orders and options for 100 of the planes and plans
to make the aircraft the backbone of its domestic fleet. The
twin-engine planes have a wide body, allowing more cabin room for
their 150 passengers.
   Northwest is the first airline in North America to receive an
Airbus A320 jetliner. The airline has direct orders for 25 of the
craft for $1.54 billion. The aircraft are to be delivered over the
next three years.
   The airline took delivery of the European-built jets less than a
month ago and placed them in regular passenger service July 1
following two weeks of pilot-training flights and Federal Aviation
Administration evaluation. The two A320s had been flying routes
between the Twin Cities, San Diego and Detroit.
   The problem with the engines is called a compressor stall and
occurs when the engine is taken from idle and placed into gear for
the initial taxi down the runway, Whalen said. An airflow imbalance
can cause the engine to stutter or stall. Whalen said stalls have
occurred three times with the two aircraft.
   ``There's no problem in flying the planes,'' Whalen said. ``We
will continue to train crews with the planes while we try to fix the
problem.''
   The stalls on the ground pose no threat to passengers but are
time-consuming because each time an engine stalls it must be
inspected before being restarted, Whalen said. ``We can't have that
kind of customer service unreliability,'' he said.
   The engines are manufactured by CFM International, a joint
venture between SNECMA of France and the General Electric Co. of the
United States. The joint venture has taken one of the engines to its
U.S. facility in Cincinnati for testing. Northwest also is examining
the engines at its maintenance facility in the Twin Cities.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal and drug-industry officials declared
support Saturday for testing of AIDS drugs by community research
organizations, in a meeting with representatives of such groups,
physicians and AIDS activists.
   ``We recognize and really want to help foster that energy that
you have,'' said Daniel Hoth, AIDS program director at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   Sandra Lehrman, head of the department of antimicrobial therapy
of Burroughs-Wellcome Co., said she believes community-based
research offers ``a real venue of growth in ways to evaluate drugs.''
   Meeting participants also raised questions about a recent federal
proposal to give some AIDS-infected people drugs that are not yet
proven effective.
   The three-day meeting, which concludes Sunday, was sponsored by
two community groups dedicated to research into acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, the Community Research Initiative of New York
and the County Community Consortium of San Francisco.
   Noting the backgrounds of participants, conference co-chairman
Michael Callen said the gathering marks a significant point in AIDS
research.
   ``After a lot of shouting at each other, we've all decided we
have more to gain from listening to each other,'' he said. ``We're
at a very important moment when everybody is willing to listen to
creative solutions to the terrible problem of AIDS.''
   Community research organizations are set up for the testing of
AIDS drugs by physicians in the community rather than traditional
institutional settings. Supporters hope to accelerate approval of
new drugs and encourage testing in minorities and other groups.
   The federal government has begun a program to promote
community-based research, which ``we are excited and very
delighted'' to encourage, said Hoth of NIAID.
   Gordon Nary of the Physicians' Association for AIDS Care
announced that the Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has committed itself to
using community-based research. It plans to test Peridex, a
gum-disease medication that may help with AIDS-related mouth
lesions, he said.
   John Petricciani, vice president for scientific and regulatory
affairs, of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said he
expects other companies to follow suit.
   NIAID director Anthony Fauci said Friday that doctors in
community programs may become involved in his proposed
``parallel-track'' program, under which some AIDS-infected people
could get drugs while effectiveness tests are still going on.
   The drugs would become available after preliminary human tests
indicate they are safe, during other studies that focus on
effectiveness. The latter studies can include only certain
categories of people and the parallel-track idea would give others a
chance to use the experimental therapy, Fauci said.
   Hoth said officials will take precautions against the possibility
that such access might interfere with the effectiveness studies. He
also said if a drug is in limited supply, the needs of research will
take precedence.
   Ellen Cooper, director of the FDA's division of anti-viral drug
products, said program participants will have to agree on criteria
for who should receive the drugs. That includes defining standards
for determining who cannot tolerate standard therapy, and who is
failing on standard therapy, she said.
   David Barr, an attorney with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, said another key question is whether FDA's
restrictions on the program, such as who gets the drug, will be so
tight that few AIDS-infected people will be helped.
   Drug companies may also need incentives to release drugs for
parallel-track use, such as tax incentives and protection from
lawsuits, he said. And a system should be established to assure that
people without a private doctor will have someone who can obtain the
drug for them, he said.
   FDA's Cooper also said that in trials of anti-virus drugs, the
agency encourages studying results obtainable earlier than the
traditional signals of death rates and appearance of AIDS-related
infections.
   Using shorter-term results, such as some blood tests, could make
drug trials briefer. But Cooper said it is not yet known what
combination of short-term results would demonstrate that a drug is
effective.

   A rescue worker's training turned tragic
when he learned the dying man brought into the emergency room was
his father.
   John McCabe Sr., 53, apparently suffered a heart attack while
driving his car early Friday. He lost control of his pickup truck,
veered across the street and struck a girl on a bicycle before
slamming into a building.
   His son John Jr., 21, a state-certified firefighter who is
studying to become an emergency medical technician as well, was in
the emergency room at Orlando Regional Medical Center when his
father was brought in.
   McCabe Jr. was assisting a nurse when paramedics wheeled in an
accident victim who was not breathing and had no pulse or blood
pressure.
   Hospital staff members worked on the man, blocking the son's view
as he stood by to help if needed, said Anba Pillay, the nurse in
charge of the emergency room.
   Someone got out the man's wallet, to get identification and see
if there was any medical information. When a nurse read the name,
the young rescue worker put his head in his hands and cried then
left the emergency room.
   ``I followed him out because I wanted to know why he had left the
room so suddenly,'' Pillay said. ``Sometimes this happens with
students.''
   The young man said: ``That's my Dad.'' He sat on the floor as
Pillay embraced him.
   McCabe's brother Pat said afterward his brother still wants to
follow through with plans to be a firefighter and emergency medical
technician.
   Pat McCabe, a paramedic for the Winter Park Fire Department, said
his father had encouraged John Jr.'s decision to pursue a career in
firefighting and emergency rescue.
   The 14-year-old bicycle rider was listed by the hospital in
serious but stable condition recovering from a concussion and a
broken shoulder bone.

<HEAD>Probe Of Apparent F-16 Engine Thefts Continues, But FBI Mum On Details</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The FBI remained tight-lipped
Saturday about its investigation of the apparent theft of three F-16
fighter jet engines from this northern Utah installation.
   The Salt Lake City FBI office would only confirm its terse Friday
announcement that the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-200 engines had been
recovered and were in government custody.
   A man who answered the phone at the FBI office Saturday would
identify himself only as ``Scott.'' He said he knew of no plans to
release further details during the weekend. ``We're not giving out
any information at all,'' he said.
   The $2 million engines _ each about 17 feet long, 3 feet in
diameter and weighing 3,200 pounds _ were discovered missing by Hill
maintenance personnel on Wednesday morning, said Hill spokesman
Louis Arana-Barradas.
   Neither the FBI nor Pentagon officials in Washington would
discuss a Friday night CBS News report that the incident may have
involved a government ``sting'' operation designed to crack down on
thefts of military property. CBS said a base employee offered to
sell the engines to undercover agents.
   The FBI refused to discuss the report, say where the engines were
found, or whether arrests had been made.
   ``I think maybe we'll be able to elaborate a little next week,
but right now things are just too sensitive,'' special agent Tim
Screen said Friday.
   Neither Screen nor other agents were available for comment
Saturday, the man answering the FBI telephone said.
   A prosecutor at the U.S. attorney's office, which likely would
file any charges resulting from the case, also declined to comment.
   ``We're not talking about it,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Stewart Walz.
   Arana-Barradas said base spokesmen were authorized to say only
that the engines had been found and ``were in government hands.''
   If the engines were stolen, he said, they would have had to leave
through one of three gates on the base that are manned 24 hours a
day by guards.
   Earlier, Hill spokeswoman Maj. Portia McCracken said
investigators believed the engines were taken off the base sometime
between noon July 1 and noon Monday.

<HEAD>Savimbi's Future Apparent Sticking Point in U.S.-Angolan Talks</HEAD>

   U.S. talks with the Marxist government
Saturday on ending Angola's 14-year-old civil war appeared to stick
on the future of U.S.-backed rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said his meeting with President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos was
``very friendly and constructive.''
   ``I believe we'll be able to expand our dialogue in the future,''
said Cohen, on his first tour of southern Africa for the Bush
administration.
   Washington is calling for direct talks between Savimbi and
Angola's government in return for diplomatic recognition withheld
since the country's independence from Portugal in 1975.
   ``We have always supported normalization of relations with the
United States,'' Dos Santos said. ``And if it were possible to sign
some kind of accord today, we'd be prepared to do so. But we
understand the United States is not yet ready.''
   The United States has been furnishing Savimbi's rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, with $15 million
a year in military aid.
   Angola is insisting that Savimbi agree to a temporary withdrawal
or self-exile from the country while peace is worked out and UNITA
members are incorporated into civilian life.
   Following a June 22 summit of African leaders in Gbadolite,
Zaire, where Dos Santos and Savimbi shook hands and agreed to a June
24 cease-fire, there were reports Savimbi accepted such conditions.
   But Dos Santos called an Angolan delegation home from peace talks
in Kinshasa, Zaire, last weekend on grounds UNITA violated the
cease-fire.
   Savimbi had previously agreed to sit out of Angolan politics for
two years before returning to participate in democratic elections,
and Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said after Gbadolite that
Savimbi had ``of his own decision'' agreed to go abroad temporarily.
   But in a news conference last week in the Ivory Coast and in a
subsequent interview with a Portuguese newspaper, Savimbi denied he
had ever made such a concession.
   Dos Santos said Saturday he told Cohen that Kaunda's statement
``constitutes the key element for the solution of Angola's internal
problems.''
   Cohen was also in Luanda to attend the fourth meeting of the
tripartite commission monitoring the U.S.-brokered Dec. 22 agreement
between Angola, Cuba and South Africa that is scheduled to lead to
independence for Namibia and set the stage for an end to Angola's
civil war.
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union, Angola's main
financial backer, are observers in the process that includes the
phased withdrawal of some 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola by
mid-1991. South Africa agreed to cease aid to UNITA in return for
the Cuban withdrawal.

   Hundreds of leftist demonstrators clashed Saturday
with police guarding a convention of the ultra-right Republican
Party, and two officers were injured and 13 people were arrested,
authorities said.
   Police used water cannons to disperse the leftists, who hurled
rocks, bottles and sticks at police and squad cars, said West Berlin
police spokesman Heinz Jaenisch.
   He said the injured officers were hit by rocks.
   Jaenisch said 3,000 leftists had gathered in West Berlin's
Kreuzberg district near the hall where the Republicans were holding
their convention. About 450 people who broke away from the main
group were involved in the disturbances, Jaenisch said.
   He said police moved against the protesters with nightsticks and
water cannons.
   The ultra-rightist Republican Party, whose platform calls for
ridding West Germany of foreigners and asylum seekers, won 11 seats
in West Berlin's legislature in January, after getting 7.5 percent
of the vote. It was the first time the party had won a seat in the
legislature.
   More than 260,000 foreigners reside in West Berlin, which has a
population of about 1.9 million people.

<HEAD>Gov't Says Mandela Met With Botha, Raising Speculation of Release</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said Saturday
that President P. W. Botha met with Nelson Mandela last week,
increasing speculation the jailed black guerrilla leader will be
freed before Botha leaves office in September.
   The 45-minute meeting at Botha's official residence in Cape Town
on Wednesday was the first time the two are known to have met.
   Government-run television reported that Foreign Minister Pik
Botha ``saw this as an event of the utmost contemporary importance.''
   The television quoted Pik Botha as saying the meeting had
``positive implications which would benefit all people in South
Africa.'' The foreign minister is not related to the president.
   However, Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said, ``I don't think it
would mean anything like that unless a statement was made to that
effect. I have no idea why the meeting took place. It could be Mr.
Botha believes there is some benefit to him or the National Party or
he may have wanted to hear Mr. Mandela's views.''
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, who attended the meeting, said
Mandela's ``courtesy visit'' was conducted in a ``pleasant spirit.''
   Coetsee said no policy matters were debated and no negotiations
were conducted but that the two men ``availed themselves of the
opportunity to confirm their support for peaceful development in
South Africa.''
   The minister said the possibility of ``further steps or meetings
was not discussed during the occasion.''
   Spokesmen for Coetsee would not say why the meeting had been kept
secret. It was announced only after a reporter for the independent
South African Press Association heard of the meeting and asked about
it.
   Unheard and unseen by the public since his conviction in 1964 on
charges of plotting to overthrow the government, Mandela
nevertheless has come to be the most admired leader among South
African blacks, who consider him the embodiment of their quest for
political freedom.
   Mandela, who will be 71 on July 18, stays alone in a prison
warden's house at the Victor Verster prison farm in Paarl, north of
Cape Town. He is serving a life sentence.
   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said Mandela did not mention the
meeting with Botha when the attorney visited his client at the
prison farm earlier Saturday. ``I assume he did not mention it
because he may have been asked not to mention it,'' Ayob said.
   On the possibility of Mandela being freed, Ayob said, ``I don't
think it would mean anything like that unless a statement was made
to that effect. I have no idea why the meeting took place. It could
be Mr. Botha believes there is some benefit to him or the National
Party, or he may have wanted to hear Mr. Mandela's views.''
   Mandela has rejected the government's repeated offers to release
him if he renounces violence. He has said the government should
renounce violence against blacks, end apartheid and legalize the
African National Congress, the largest guerrilla movement fighting
the white-dominated government.
   The ANC was outlawed in 1960, and the next year Mandela founded
its guerrilla wing, Spear of the Nation. He was imprisoned in 1962
for leaving the country illegally and organizing an illegal strike
by black workers. In 1964 he was convicted of sabotage and plotting
the overthrow of the government and sentenced to life in prison. He
is regarded as the leader of the ANC, although the highest office he
held before it was banned was deputy president-general.
   Botha, 73, has headed the government for 11 years, first as prime
minister and as president since 1984.
   During the past year, Botha has dropped his requirement that
Mandela renounce violence and has said he hopes it will be possible
to free him. Botha is at odds with the governing National Party,
whose leaders forced him to agree to retire from the presidency in
favor of party head F.W. de Klerk. The change will occur after
September parliamentary elections.
   While many government leaders acknowledge the advantage of
freeing Mandela and beginning negotiations with South Africa's black
majority, they fear that such an action before an election could
cause a black uprising and cost thousands of votes that would
instead go to the right-wing. There has been speculation that a new
government, under de Klerk, might free Mandela after the election.
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said in July 1988 that
Mandela had served enough time to pay for his crimes and that the
only thing keeping him in prison was the government's uncertainty
about the effect he would have on politics and national security.
   Denis Worrall, a co-leader of the anti-apartheid opposition
Democratic Party, said in London, ``The fact that President Botha
talks to Nelson Mandela ... makes it so much easier for us to
justify to the (white) electorate the talks which we are having with
the ANC.''
   During the 1987 elections for the white chamber of Parliament,
the National Party with Botha at the helm got extensive political
mileage from the fact that members of the now-defunct Progressive
Federal Party had talked to the ANC.

<HEAD>Lake Michigan Fish Risk Canary or Red Herring?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD EGGLESTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canary or red herring? That's the debate
over a new study by the National Wildlife Federation claiming a
greater cancer risk than previously thought in Lake Michigan fish.
   The federation wants the hazards of toxic chemicals in the lake's
fish to serve much the same role as the canary in a coal mine,
measuring the region's environmental health.
   But critics say the federation's report issued late last month
amounted to a red herring that needlessly alarmed the public.
   Using a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency formula and more
than 100 health studies, the wildlife federation published a 17-page
booklet titled ``Lake Michigan Sport Fish: Should You Eat Your
Catch?''
   The booklet estimated at 1 in 100,000 the lifetime cancer risk of
eating 15 meals of coho salmon or walleyed pike tainted with
chemicals from the lake, to cite just one example.
   Experts are skeptical of such estimates.
   Risk estimates based on tests involving laboratory animals are
``purely guesswork,'' said Dr. Henry Pitot, director of the McArdle
Cancer Research Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
   They are ``make-believe numbers,'' said Dr. Sidney Shindell,
chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the Medical
College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
   ``It's all based on basically bad science,'' said biochemistry
professor Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley.
   The amount of sun a person soaks up catching a Lake Michigan fish
probably poses a greater cancer risk than eating the fish, and
driving to the lake certainly is more life-threatening than eating
the fish, Ames said.
   Ames added that there is no comparison at all between the risk of
cancer in the environment and the risk posed by smoking, which is
responsible for about one-third of all cancer.
   Nevertheless, Wisconsin officials received telephone calls from
people as far away as Fargo, N.D., and Omaha, Neb., asking whether
they should throw away the Lake Michigan fish they caught on a
recent vacation, or cancel a planned trip.
   Angry commercial fishermen in Michigan called the wildlife
federation suggesting the group buy their unsold lake trout.
   Mark Van Putten of the federation's Great Lakes Natural Resources
Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., responded by suggesting the fishermen
market unsold fish to polluting industries.
   Sport fishing is an industry worth billions of dollars on the
Great Lakes, and charter boat operators and sportsmen's clubs are
anxiously watching the situation.
   State officials in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin are
telling worried citizens that they are comfortable with health
advice based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards for
commercial fish.
   The official advice says people should trim the fat and skin from
smaller fish caught in Lake Michigan; that women and children should
not eat medium-sized fish; and that no one should eat very large
fish from the lake.
   The longer and older a fish, the more likely it is to have in its
tissues toxic chemicals like PCBs and the pesticides DDT, dieldrin
and chordane. The extra precaution on medium-size fish is directed
at women because of the danger PCBs pose to the reproductive system,
children because their relatively small body weight can magnify the
effect of eating a toxic substance.
   The official advisory does not attempt to rate cancer risk,
precisely because of the public confusion that creates, Lee
Liebenstein, toxic chemicals specialist for the Wisconsin Department
of Natural Resources, said.
   Van Putten, who was in charge of the two-year National Wildlife
Federation project, said the cancer-risk studies his group used are
the best science available, and are accepted by the EPA and other
government agencies.
   The federation's pamphlet recognizes that the risks are
estimates, but it provides citizens with valuable information they
need to set pollution cleanup priorities and demand action, Van
Putten said.
   ``Don't get frustrated, get mad and get active,'' he advises.
   ``Some of these risks are small compared with other risks in
society, but they're risks that ought to be reduced,'' said Jan
Beyea, a senior scientist with the National Audubon Society in New
York City.
   And even critics of risk estimates based on tests using
laboratory animals say people should not go hog wild about fish
bearing traces of chemicals.
   ``Before you eat a fish out of Lake Michigan for dinner every
evening, you should think about it,'' Ames said.
   Van Putten said fish caught in such places as Santa Monica Bay,
Calif.;, Quincy Bay, Mass.; the Ohio River; the Hudson River and
Puget Sound also are contaminated with traces of industrial and
agricultural chemicals.
   But more information is available about Lake Michigan fish than
about fish from other pollution hotspots, he said.

   Temperatures were above normal Saturday across large parts of the
nation, with record highs in the western and northern Plains and
central Rockies, and strong thunderstorms developed over the Midwest.
   A stagnant upper-level high pressure system dominated the
nation's weather by spreading temperatures in the 90s from the
southern Atlantic Coast across the middle and lower Mississippi
Valley, much of the Plains and the central Rockies to interior
California.
   Rapid City, S.D., reached 103 degrees before 11 a.m., then rose
to a record 107.
   Other records included 97 at Cheyenne, Wyo.; 100 at Denver; and
101 at Williston, N.D. Casper, Wyo., tied its record of 100 and
Scottsbluff, Neb., tied its record of 105.
   The reading at Denver extended the city's consecutive days of 100
degrees or higher to five. During 118 years of weather
record-keeping at Denver, there had never before been more than two
consecutive days of triple-digit temperatures.
   Strong thunderstorms developed in unstable air near a warm front
over central Illinois and Indiana during the afternoon.
   Warm, very humid air from the Gulf of Mexico triggered showers
and thunderstorms from central Texas across the Gulf Coast states to
the Georgia and South Carolina coast.
   An upper air disturbance off the northern Pacific Coast produced
showers along the Washington coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57 at
Quillayute, Wash., to 111 at Needles, Calif. Saturday's low in the
Lower 48 states was 40 at Truckee, Calif., and Redmond, Ore.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the lower Mississippi Valley along the eastern Gulf Coast
region into the Florida Peninsula, and from the eastern half of the
upper Great Lakes into the upper Ohio Valley and the lower Great
Lakes.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted in northern Maine; in the 70s and
80s along much of the Pacific Coast; in the 80s in the northern
Intermountain region between the Rockies and the Cascade Range, much
of Montana, and from northern Minnesota across the lower Great Lakes
into the northern Atlantic Coast states; above 100 across sections
of the central Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley, the central
Rockies, and from the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in Texas across the
desert Southwest into interior valleys of central and southern
California; and in the 90s in much of the rest of the nation.

   The Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device with a

in Kazakhstan, the official news agency Tass reported.
   ``The test was carried out for the purpose of upgrading military
hardware,'' the report said. ``Radiation levels at and outside the

   The detonation occurred at 7:47 a.m., Tass said.
   A kiloton has the explosive force of 1,000 pounds of TNT. The
atomic bomb dropped Aug. 6, 1945, on Hiroshima, Japan, in the first

   A dental hygienist and born-again Christian
who was fired for preaching to patients can't expect to receive
unemployment benefits, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled.
   Dr. J.B. Mulder Jr. fired Sharlyn Vanderlaan of Grand Rapids in
1986 after she ignored at least a dozen warnings to stop preaching
while she worked.
   A three-judge appeals court panel on Friday upheld rulings by the
Michigan Employment Security Commission and lower courts denying
Vanderlaan unemployment compensation.
   ``A dentist has the right to expect his dental hygienist, whose
work is often painful and requires the patient to be verbally and
physically submissive, to behave in a manner which does not add more
discomfort,'' the court said in rejecting Vanderlaan's claim that
she was exercising her First Amendment-protected right to free
speech.
   At least six of Mulder's patients changed dentists because of
Vanderlaan's preaching, according to court records.
   Vanderlaan's attorney, Keith Beauchemin, said she ``was compelled
by her faith to share it with just about anybody she had the
opportunity to ... even if it meant losing her job.''
   Vanderlaan found a part-time job with a dentist who lets her
preach. She currently is out of the country on a religious mission.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact
allies Saturday praised President Bush's NATO proposal for deep cuts
in conventional forces and said an accord on reductions could be
reached next year.
   But the two-day summit of the East Bloc military alliance in the
Romanian capital ended with no concrete proposals on arms control or
visible signs of healing in rifts that divide the bloc.
   In remarks at a dinner Friday, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said the annual gathering would give a ``serious, palpable
answer'' to Western proposals on cuts in conventional forces
announced by Bush May 29 at a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium.
   On behalf of the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Bush called for military cutbacks that would fix a ceiling of
275,000 troops in Europe for each superpower and make deep cuts in
tanks, combat aircraft and artillery.
   In a joint declaration, the Warsaw Pact countries said the Bush
plan converged with their proposals, and that rapid progress in
negotiating cuts was now possible.
   ``During the meeting it was noted that the additional proposals
regarding conventional armed forces in Europe made at the recent
NATO Council summit session met halfway the allied socialist
countries' stand,'' the Eastern alliance said.
   Member countries of the Warsaw Pact _ the Soviet Union, Poland,
East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Hungary _ said
they expected details of the NATO proposals to be put forward in
Vienna, Austria, where both sides are participating in conventional
arms reduction talks.
   Even without knowing the fine print of Bush's proposal, which
will be formally presented in September, the Warsaw Pact said
conditions are ripe for agreement.
   ``The opinion was expressed that the situation of the
negotiations is such that the first understandings may be achieved
already in 1990, provided that a constructive approach is taken by
all,'' the declaration said.
   The Warsaw Pact has proposed a limit of 1.35 million troops for
each side in Europe.
   According to NATO, to comply with Bush's plan the United States
would have to remove 30,000 troops from Europe, while the Soviets
would have to pull out more than 10 times that, or 325,000.
   However, the Soviet-led alliance cautioned that despite
encouraging signs such as the superpower treaty eliminating
intermediate-range missiles, ``no radical turning point in
disarmament questions has been recorded yet.''
   It accused NATO of continuing a ``policy of force'' and said the
Western alliance's nuclear deterrent strategy still causes worry.
   The final document repeated Kremlin demands that the United
States drop plans to modernize short-range nuclear weapons in
Europe, and instead negotiate their elimination.
   The pact also proposed creation of a ``center for lessening the
military theat'' in Europe to prevent surprise attacks by serving as
a clearinghouse for information and consultation.
   The 16-page Russian-language document repeated Warsaw Pact
proposals for bans on all nuclear and chemical weapons and the
liquidation of both military blocs to do away the division of Europe
bequeathed by the Cold War.
   The Romanian deputy foreign minister, Constantin Oancea, told a
news conference that the Warsaw Pact's decision showed it ``is
seeking a dialogue with all European countries.''
   The summit declaration and a separate communique made no mention
of quarrels in the bloc, some of which are based on ideology, and
others on centuries-old rivalries.
   ``We met here as equals without trying to divide,'' said Oancea,
secretary- general of the pact's political consultative committee.
``We did not come here to give grades or marks to one another.''
   In line with Gorbachev's pledge that the Kremlin would no longer
interfere in the affairs of its allies, the Warsaw Pact declared in
a seperate communique that each member country has the ``right to
make its own political lines, strategy and tactics without any
outside interference.''
   Gorbachev, in an interview with the Soviet television news show
Vremya, repeated predictions that the Warsaw Pact would be
transformed from a military into a political alliance.
   ``The time will come when the need for it will disappear,'' he
said, and called for another Warsaw Pact meeting to chart economic
cooperation.
   ``We must not be too slow here. We must act, because ... the fact
that we have fallen behind in a number of important directions is
telling upon the level of well being, and, naturally, on the living
standards of our people.''
   Gorbachev returned to Moscow Saturday at the head of a delegation
that included Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Defense Minister
Dmitri Yazov, Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Politburo member Alexander
Yakovlev.
   The Warsaw Pact held its closed-door summit in Bucharest's
glittering former royal palace.
   Access granted reporters bore little sign of the greater openness
now encouraged by Gorbachev. Journalists were, however, allowed to
be present for dinner remarks Friday by Gorbachev and his host,
Romanian President Nicolai Ceausescu, as well as the brief signing
ceremony Saturday.
   Gorbachev used a black fountain pen to put his signature with a
bold flourish on the agreement, bound in red leather, and smiled at
journalists gathered in the marble-columned hall.
   One veteran of many Warsaw Pact summits, East German President
Erich Honecker, took ill and flew home Saturday morning, missing the
ceremony.

British leader's country home.
   The two had met Friday in London, and Saturday's luncheon at
Chequers, 35 miles northwest of London, was described as more a
social occasion than a working meeting.
   Ms. Bhutto will visit Customs and Excise headquarters in London
on Tuesday in connection with campaigns by Pakistan and Britain
against the heroin trade.
   The Pakistani leader won power last November in Pakistan's first
free elections in more than a decade. She arrived in Britain
Wednesday for a one-week visit.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. denied reports Saturday
that it plans to add stories to the Sears Tower because another
Chicago skyscraper might overshadow the world's tallest building.
   The Wall Street Journal and the Chicago Sun-Times reported that
Sears is planning to outdo two Chicago developers who announced
plans in May to erect a taller skyscraper only a few blocks from the
Sears building.
   ``Not to be outdone,'' Friday's Journal said, ``Sears quietly
began drawing up contingency plans to add at least 16 floors to its
tower _ topping the proposed unstart by at least one floor.''
   ``Absolutely not,'' Sears spokesman Doug Fairweather said when
asked if the story was true.
   The Sun-Times reported Saturday that Sears is preparing plans for
an addition, but neither the Sun-Times nor the Journal quoted Sears
officials by name.
   The Sears tower is for sale, and the Journal said the company is
preparing the plans to placate potential buyers who might balk at
the thought of owning the world's second-tallest building.
   Construction would be done by the new owner, the Journal said.
   ``There are no plans, nor has there been any formal study for
such a plan. Not a nickel has been spent,'' Fairweather insisted.

<HEAD>State Board Reimburses Clients With Dishonest Attorneys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state board created to reimburse clients for
intentional dishonesty by their attorneys has paid out hundreds of
thousands of dollars, and its chairman says more money is needed for
future scandals.
   More than $500,000 was paid to reimburse clients of two lawyers
accused of stealing from their clients. Ex-attorney John Flanagan
served a prison term and former lawyer Mark Sampson vanished.
   The two-year-old Client Security Board, created in response to
the highly publicized Sampson and Flanagan cases, reports that it
has repaid all but one qualifying client of the two lawyers.
   The board generally has received praise for prompt payment of
claims.
   ``The court feels it has been very successful,'' said Associate
Justice A.M. Keith, the Minnesota Supreme Court's liaison to the
board. His comments were echoed by Ralph Peterson, head of the state
bar association.
   The board's chairman, Melvin Orenstein, a Minneapolis attorney,
said Friday that most of the 51 people reimbursed so far have been
paid in full. Some received only partial payment if they received
money from other sources.
   Orenstein said the board still has about half of the $1.4 million
it collected from a one-time assessment of $100 per lawyer, which
the Minnesota Supreme Court ordered after creating the board. But he
said the board soon will need more money and is likely to ask for an
annual attorneys' fee of about $20.
   Sampson, a Fridley attorney, disappeared three years ago after
allegedly taking about $450,000 from clients, reportedly to help pay
for an elaborate house.
   Sampson is still missing, but 19 of his former clients have
received a total of $413,000 from the board. Only one claim filed
earlier this year is pending.
   ``It's too bad that lawyers have to have a board like that,''
said Richard Brisbois, who said his family received prompt service
after submitting a claim on behalf of his grandmother's estate,
which Sampson had handled.
   Flanagan, of St. Paul, disappeared also, but was later found in
Utah. He was convicted of stealing $415,000 and was released from
prison after serving one-third of a 10-year term for theft.
   Flanagan's former clients received $110,000 from the board with
the remainder of their claims collected from other sources, such as
banks which had honored forged checks written by Flanagan.

<TEXT>
   The Wayne Chicken Show, where bare-chested
male ``Chick `N' Dale'' dancers marched in a parade Saturday before
the National Cluck-Off competition, was something to crow about.
   ``I don't know if it's an honor to be a dumb cluck or not,'' said
John Vavra, 39, a hard-boiled construction worker who won the
cackling contest for the third consecutive year.
   He reclaimed the title despite the efforts of Bill Patrick of
Vassar, Mich., whose co-workers at a foundry raised $400 to give him
a crack at the championship.
   ``My fine-feathered friends egged me on to come out here,'' said
Patrick, 37, who placed third in the adult rooster competition.
   He began crowing because he didn't want his daughter to believe
roosters said ``cock-a-doodle-doo,'' like the sound one of her toys
made.
   Joelle Patrick, 11, apparently learned the correct cackle. She
won first place in the rooster imitation contest for children under
13.
   The chicken show began as an arts festival nine years ago in
Wayne, a community of about 5,200 people, about 120 miles northwest
of Omaha.
   ``We were trying to come up with a theme to show that art can be
found in anything'' said Jane O'Leary, one of the organizers.
``Someone said `chicken' and we laughed so hard.''
   There is no one chairman of the show, she said. ``We have no
pecking order.''
   The festival has grown into an event that attracts hundreds of
people. The Milton Waldbaum Co., an egg producer in nearby
Wakefield, has been one of many business supporters for the show. On
Saturday, festival workers dished out 2,000 omelettes during a free
feed in the morning, Ms. O'Leary said.
   Later, hundreds of people lined the streets to watch the Chicken
Show parade, where about half a dozen legislative aides in paper
chicken feet clucked as the ``Legislative Mutant Ninja Chickens.''
   ``It's the outreach program of the Capitol,'' Doug Clark, an aide
for Sen. Brad Ashford of Omaha, said with a laugh.
   They followed a bare-chested band of ``Chick `N' Dale'' male
dancers wearing brown paper bags and orange beaks on the their heads.
   The show also featured contests for egg dropping and having the
most beautiful beak. But the highlight was the annual hen and
rooster cluckng contest.
   Vavra came from Crete to cackle. ``As the chicken flies, it's 125
miles away,'' he explained. ``It's within squawking distance.''
   Besides Patrick, Vavra out-clucked John Agler, 34, of Wayne, who
had strutted to the championship from 1982-86.
   Agler, second in the adult rooster contest, began crowing as a
child growing up on a farm. A clucking judge in 1987, Agler decided
it's important to act as well as sound like a chicken.
   He began his performance by spreading a bag of corn on the stage.
Other contestants squatted, flapped wings and jerked their beaks.
   ``Basically, it's just fun,'' Agler said.

   Israelis enraged by a deadly attack on a
commuter bus stoned Palestinian vehicles on Saturday, and at least
one Arab was killed and four were injured, Israeli and Arab reports
said.
   In the occupied territories, Arabs shot and killed two
Palestinians suspected of helping Israeli authorities, and Israeli
soldiers reportedly shot and killed a Palestinian during a
confrontation with stone-throwers.
   At least 22 Palestinians were injured in half a dozen clashes
with Israeli troops, according to Arab reports.
   The army confirmed three fatalities and two woundings, and said
the circumstances were under investigation.
   Soldiers also searched several villages in the West Bank and
conducted an unspecified number of arrests, an army spokesman said.
   The four reported fatalities raised to 550 the number of
Palestinians killed in the almost 19-month-old Arab uprising against
Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 33
Israelis have been slain.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on the radio that his
government would consider new measures, such as the death penalty
for convicted terrorists, in response to the bus crash Thursday.
Israeli law allows capital punishment for murder, but judges have
refrained from giving this penalty to Arabs, fearing possible
retaliation against Israeli prisoners held in Arab countries.
   Fourteen passengers died when an Arab passenger screaming ``God
is great'' forced the bus into a deep ravine, where it caught fire.
It was the worst assault on an Israeli target since the uprising
began.
   Police described the passenger as a bearded man in his 20s from
Nozeirat refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. Jerusalem police
spokesman Uzi Sandori said the man was cooperating with Israeli
investigators.
   In Tunis, the Palestinian news agency Wafa described the bus
attack as a heroic prelude to a popular revolution.
   ``This suicidal and heroic act is of a new type carried out by a
youth exasperated by the oppression of fanatics and the Israeli
soldiers,'' Wafa said.
   Meanwhile, Arab reports said that Palestinian motorist Jamal
Nasir, 31, of Gaza City, was stoned to death and that four
passengers in his automobile were injured. The automobile reportedly
overturned on a highway near the southern Israeli desert town of
Netivot after rocks were hurled from a passing Israeli-owned car.
   A police spokesman for the Negev desert region, Shalom Ben Hemo,
confirmed the incident and said Nasir died at an area hospital. He
declined to say whether the assailants were Israelis.
   Arab motorists also were stoned in Jerusalem's Shmuel Hanavi
Quarter, where police used tear gas in battles with dozens of
Israeli militants who blocked a major traffic route, police said.
   An Israeli man was injured by flying glass in one stoning
incident and 15 suspects were detained, Jerusalem police spokesman
Uzi Sandori said. Protesters also stoned the home of left-wing
legislator Dedi Zucker, Israel TV said.
   Arabs retaliated by throwing a firebomb at a border police jeep
in the Abu Tor Quarter, Sandori said. No injuries were reported in
the firebomb attack.
   In northern Israel, a group of Jews beat up three Arab teen-agers
on a beach in the Caesaria coastal resort, also in retribution for
Thursday's bus attack, said a police spokesman for the northern
district, Gideon Arbel.
   Another Palestinian, Mustafa Abed el Saed, 42, was killed
Saturday when he was shot in the head and neck in Gaza City as he
rode his motorcycle to work at Gaza city hall, Arab reports said.
The reports said el Saed was suspected of providing information to
Israeli authorities.
   Palestinians also reportedly killed Ismail Hussein Al Ghoush, 55,
of Yatta in the West Bank. Al Ghoush was shot in the abdomen by
masked men who broke into his home Friday night, Arab reports said.
   In Gaza's Rafah district, soldiers shot and killed Ziad Zaki Abu
Olwan, 20, after opening fire on stone-throwing demonstrators in a
marketplace. At least nine of the 22 Palestinians wounded Saturday
were injured in the Rafah confrontation, the reports said.
   The other injuries occurred in clashes in the Jabaliya refugee
camp in Gaza, Gaza City, Nablus, Atil and the Tulkarem refugee camp
in the West Bank.

   Graceland, Elvis Presley's home, set a

   The previous one-day viewing record was 4,771 set July 4 a year

   ``I always get a kick out of things like this,'' said Jack Soden,
Graceland executive director. ``I remember when I came here how
people said it would never work or would only last a couple years.''
   Soden said visitors on Monday spent $110,000 on tour tickets and
in the Graceland-operated shops. Presley paid $103,000 for the the
big house in 1957. It opened for tours in 1982.
   Presley, ``the king of rock 'n' roll,'' died of heart disease at
his home on Aug. 16, 1977.

<TEXT>
   A hungry piranha nicknamed Alice is
wreaking havoc on the natural denizens of a city pond, and has
eluded capture by fishermen armed with hooks, nets and electrical
shock equipment.
   Two of the razor-toothed South American fish were recently
spotted in the pond at Alice Keck Park, a popular dumping ground for
unwanted pet fish.
   Park visitors and workers began finding a number of partially
eaten fish, and turtles turned up missing legs. Frogs fled for safer
ground.
   One of the piranhas was caught Friday on a hook baited with beef
liver.
   ``It was a good fight,'' said city parks worker Bob Sloan who
reeled in the piranha. ``He came out of the water twice.''
   Ken Sasaki, state Department of Fish and Game biologist, said the
fish was 17 inches long and weighed 2{ pounds. It had been caught
once before, but was tossed back when it was misidentified as a
pacu, a harmless piranha lookalike.
   Park superintendent Jeff Cope said Alice, the remaining piranha,
seemed even more wary of people after its compatriot was bagged.
Efforts to hook her Saturday morning were not successful.
   The shock equipment produced too small an electrical field and
operators couldn't get close enough to the fish for the equipment to
have any effect.
   ``This fish is too fast and too smart for him to get close,''
said Cope.
   He said the park department's next plan of attack may be to get
an archer to skewer the fish with an arrow, or perhaps use a baited
trap.
   ``In the meantime, we're gonna keep fishin','' Cope said.

<TEXT>
   Carlos Menem was sworn in Saturday
as Argentina's 46th president and asked his countrymen to help
rebuild a nation broken by inflation and divided by political
dissent.
   ``All of us together will cure Argentina or Argentina will die,''
said the 59-year-old son of Syrian immigrants in a sober,
conciliatory acceptance speech broadcast nationwide from Congress.
``This is the cruel choice.''
   Later, outgoing President Raul Alfonsin draped the blue-and-white
silk sash of office over Menem's shoulders, completing this
turbulent country's first transition from one freely elected
president to another in 61 years.
   ``I'm happy,'' Alfonsin told reporters before flying to his
hometown, Chascomus, 75 miles south of the capital.``I leave the
presidency without having known hatred or rancor. I leave the
presidency without having met a single enemy.''
   Menem, of the Peronist Party, takes over a country ravaged by
inflation and the worst recession in its 173-year history.
Alfonsin's inability to stabilize the economy forced him to resign
five months before his term officially ended.
   As real wages fell by more than 40 percent and unemployment
climbed to 10 percent this year, food riots broke out in several
cities. Looting and mass arrests occurred again last week in
Rosario, the third-largest city.
   By Menem's estimate, nearly a third of Argentina's 31 million
citizens live in poverty or suffer from illiteracy, malnutrition or
untreated sickness.
   After swearing in his eight-man Cabinet, Menem spoke from the
balcony from which former populist Juan Domingo Peron addressed
similar crowds during his ill-fated presidencies from 1946-55, and
1973-74.
   ``Argentina is passing through the worst crisis in its history,''
the slightly built president said. ``Enough of this situation. Tough
days are coming, but ... within a prudent period, we will harvest
good fruit.''
   Earlier, in his acceptance speech, the three-time provincial
governor and former political prisoner focused on the need for his
government to remedy the country's ills.
   ``Atop these ruins, all of us will build the home we deserve,''
he said in the 52-minute speech that was interrupted 32 times by
applause. ``From this broken country, we will raise a new fatherland
for ourselves and for our children.''
   Conquering inflation that in June soared by 114.5 percent will be
his ``first and fundamental battle,'' Menem said.
   He also pledged to resolve the military issue that sparked three
barracks revolts against Alfonsin: the trials of officers charged
with human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83 military
dictatorship.
   He received perhaps the most sustained applause when he pledged
to continue efforts to recover the Falkland Islands in the South
Atlantic over which Argentina and Britain went to war in 1982.
Argentina, which calls the islands the Malvinas, disputes Britain's
claim of ownership.
   Menem did not specify what anti-inflation policies he would
implement. Aides indicated last week his plan would be based on
price controls, a major devaluation of the austral, strict monetary
control and increased rates for public utilities and services.
   Economy Minister Miguel Roig was expected to announce price
guidelines and significant gas, public transport and utility
increases on Sunday. The price of milk, bread and many other basic
foods rose by 100 percent or more in the past two days.
   Menem said Argentina's $64 billion foreign debt, which includes
outstanding interest of about $4 billion, was ``imprudently
contracted over more than a decade'' but was an obligation the
country must repay.
   Menem hinted he might seek to call off the pending human rights
trials of 15 generals and three admirals rather than allow the
bitter, emotional proceedings to continue.
   ``We're not going to lose time in making concrete the
reconciliation of all Argentines,'' he said. ``The time has come for
each Argentine to extend his hand to his brother to make a chain
that is stronger than rancor, or discord, or resentment, or pain.''
   At least 8,960 alleged leftists were arrested, never seen again
and presumed executed during the military regime's crackdown on
subversion, according to a commission appointed by Alfonsin.
   Menem, at the time the governor of La Rioja Province, was jailed
for nearly five years following the overthrow of President Isabel
Peron in March 1976.
   Tens of thousands of well-wishers in this city of 8 million
cheered as Menem slowly made his way on the one-mile route from
Congress to Government House.
   ``Menem: the country needs you,'' said one banner. ``Long live
the fatherland,'' many shouted. A sign on a young boy dressed in a
jacket and tie stated, ``Thank you President Alfonsin, Thank you
President Menem for letting me grow up in democracy.''
   Menem's 1950s-era Cadillac convertible was flanked by police on
motorcycles and saber-carrying grenadiers on horseback.
   His victory in national elections May 14 marked the return of the
Peronist Party to the presidency for the first time since 1976, and
only the second time since 1955. Both previous Peronist presidencies
were overthrown by military coup.
   Nevertheless, there was little sense of jubilation like that on
Dec. 10, 1983, when Alfonsin formally replaced the discredited
dictatorship.
   Alfonsin and many Argentines thought the return of democracy
alone would spur economic growth. Argentines now hope Menem can
stave off disaster.
   ``Nobody expects Menem to make the country opulent,'' Peronist
Gov. Jose Octavio Bordon said in an interview. ``They just expect
that every day will be a little better.''

<HEAD>Mexican Government, Bankers Working on Debt Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mexican government and a 15-bank committee
were near agreement on a debt restructuring plan that would cut
Mexico's payments by almost one-fifth or $3 billion annually,
negotiators said Saturday.
   ``Mexico and the Bank Advisory Committee are close to agreement
in principle on a range of options, including debt and debt service
reduction as well as new money options,'' said a joint statement
from Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's undersecretary for International
Financial Affairs, and committee co-chairman William R. Rhodes.
   ``The package under discussion should provide Mexico with
financial benefits in excess of $3 billion annually,'' the statement
said. No other details were provided, but both sides said talks will
resume Monday.
   A $3 billion cut in debt payments would mean a significant gain
for Mexico, which had expected to shell out about $16 billion this
year to foreign lenders.
   Mexico's foreign debt is second-largest in the developing world
after Brazil. The Mexican debt talks are seen as an important
indicator in the Third World debt crisis and as essential to
Mexico's economic recovery and stability.
   The negotiators issued the joint communique after talks that
lasted until nearly dawn, the Mexican government news agency Notimex
said. The talks, which began April 19, were held in New York City at
Citibank, the lead bank of the 15 on the Bank Advisory Committee for
Mexico.
   About $54 billion of Mexico's $107.4 billion foreign debt is owed
to private banks in the industrialized world.
   The New York Times reported Saturday that the Mexican government
was hoping for a 40 percent discount on a portion of that $54
billion, while the committee was considering 35 percent. Other loans
could be cut from the current 10 percent interest to 6.25 percent,
the Times said.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has made debt
reduction the centerpiece of his new administration's policies and
he has tried to woo lenders offering both economic and political
reform.
   The possibility of an agreement came at the 11th hour for Mexico,
which is not believed to have enough foreign reserves to cover
upcoming debt payments.
   Mexico's economy has been stifled by the debt crisis and other
economic setbacks such as high inflation. The average workers'
earning power has declined by 50 percent in six years and the
pressure on the Salinas government for debt relief is intense.
   Salinas has said his goal is to cut annual debt payments from 6
percent to 2 percent of the gross national product.
   In Washington, the Treasury Department issued a statement
praising the pending agreement.
   ``We welcome the additional progress which has been achieved by
the government of Mexico and the commercial banks toward finalizing
the terms of a financing package for Mexico involving debt
reduction, debt service reduction and new money,'' said the
statement.

<TEXT>
   Relations between Romania and Hungary
have hit ``a bottom point,'' a top Hungarian official said after
delegations from the two countries met Saturday.
   ``We took stock of all problems affecting our relations and the
only area where agreement was reached was that we are neighbors and
better relations are in (our mutual) interest,'' said Foreign
Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary.
   Horn's comments, carried by Hungary's state-run MTI news agency,
came after a meeting between Romanian Communist Party leader Nicolae
Ceausescu and Hungarian party chairman Rezsoe Nyers.
   Romania's official Agerpres news agency said the talks focused on
``several timely questions'' of bilateral cooperation.
   The brief report did not give details of the talks, but said the
two sides ``stressed the need ... to develop relations in a spirit
of good neighborliness (and) mutual interest.''
   ``The Hungarian delegation stated that relations are satisfactory
only in the economic field, while in the political sphere we have
reached a bottom point,'' MTI quoted Horn as saying.
   Bilateral relations between the Warsaw Pact nations are strained
over Bucharest's alleged discrimination against Romania's 1.7
million-strong Hungarian minority and the planned razing of
thousands of villages, including ethnic Hungarian communities.
   An estimated 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians,
have fled to Hungary in the past two years.

   About half of Americans expect their states to
pass laws that would restrict abortions in light of the U.S. Supreme
Court's decision that such laws are constitutional, according to a
poll released Saturday.
   Fifty-two percent said they believed their states would pass new
laws, according to the poll in the July 19 issue of Newsweek.
   The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a Missouri law restricting
abortion, clearing the way for other states to do so.
   The court's decision met with disapproval by 53 percent of
Americans polled, while 37 percent approved.
   The poll also found that 75 percent of Americans believe any such
laws would lead to more teen-agers becoming mothers; 72 percent said
there would be more deaths due to illegal abortions; 69 percent said
they expect more limited access to abortions for poor women; and 63
percent said the laws would lead to more mistreated children.
   For the poll, The Gallup Organization interviewed 751 adults by
telephone July 6 and July 7. The margin of error is plus or minus 4
percentage points.

<HEAD>Mother of Lebanon Hostage John McCarthy Dies of Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of British hostage John
McCarthy, held in Lebanon for more than three years, died of cancer
at a hospital in Cambridge Saturday, doctors said. She was 66.
   The precise nature of Sheila McCarthy's cancer was not disclosed
in a statement issued by her doctors. Her husband, Patrick, was at
her bedside when she died at Addenbrookes hospital, the statement
said.
   The couple's 32-year-old son John, a television journalist, was
riding in a taxi to Beirut's airport to catch a London flight when
he was kidnapped by gunmen on April 17, 1986.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Mrs. McCarthy's was ``a
reminder to us all of the human tragedy of the kidnapping and the
sheer heartlessness of the kidnappers who ignored the family's
appeal to let Mrs. McCarthy see her son again before she died.''
   Mrs. McCarthy, in a statement issued June 21, appealed to her
son's abductors to set him free.
   It was relayed through her doctor, Terence Wheeler, who said at
the time: ``As Mrs. McCarthy's personal doctor, I appeal to those
holding John in the name of humanity, for which Islam is well known,
to show compassion and release John to his dying mother.''
   There was no response from the kidnappers. The statement followed
a similar appeal by Patrick McCarthy that was published in several
Beirut newspapers.
   In addition to McCarthy, 16 Westerners are still missing in
Lebanon. They include American journalist Terry Anderson, the
longest-held foreign captive. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   No group has claimed responsibility for McCarthy's abduction,
which came amid a wave of kidnappings of foreigners by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem zealots.
   McCarthy, employed by the London-based Worldwide Television News,
was seized two days after U.S. warplanes bombed Libyan targets in
retaliation for terrorist acts the United States alleged were
sponsored by Libya.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government allowed U.S.
warplanes to fly from bases in Britain for the attacks. The raids
caused widespread anger against the United States and Britain in
Moslem countries.

   About 375
snorkelers and scuba divers really ``got down'' Saturday, taking the
plunge for some finger-snapping, flipper-slapping tunes at the
Underwater Music Festival.
   For three hours, Florida Keys radio station WWUS blasted tunes by
such artists at Jimmy Buffett and The Beach Boys through six
underwater speakers.
   ``When music is broadcast underwater it seems to envelope you
from all directions,'' said Bill Becker, the station's news director
and coordinator of the event. ``Because sound travels five times
faster underwater than it does in the air, it generates an
unforgettable effect.''
   The underwater speakers were hung from boats stationed at
strategic points above the coral reef to create the best
surround-sound effect, Becker said.
   Also piped through to the listeners were announcements concerning
reef conditions and preservation techniques.

   Striking coal miners will win their labor
struggle against The Pittston Co. if they stand together, a United
Mine Workers official and U.S. Rep. Bob Wise told about 2,000 union
members at a rally Saturday.
   ``Our forefathers and their forefathers fought so we could have
our rights,'' District 17 President Bob Phalen Phalen told miners
and their supporters at the rally.
   ``We've got to fight to keep those rights. It's everybody's
fight. Always remember that. It's everybody's fight,'' he said.
   The rally at a high school football field began with a procession
by 20 striking Eastern Airlines pilots from Atlanta.
   ``We just decided to come and join our union brothers here in
their battle against the attitude that seems to be prevalent in
management today,'' said Ed Miskotten, an Eastern Airlines captain.
   Wise, D-W.Va., praised the UMW for its patience in dealing with
Pittston and urged Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas to become
personally involved in negotiations.
   ``This is about a fair contract,'' Wise said, ``a contract that's
fair to the miners, and yes, fair to the company. ... Come back to
the table, Douglas, because if this goes on much longer we risk
unraveling the progress in labor and management relations made in
the past 15 years.''
   The rally came one day after UMW President Richard Trumka
announced a union-sanctioned, three-day memorial period starting
Monday. It was the UMW's first official sanction for miners to
protest Pittston since wildcat strikes began in mid-June.
   All UMW members east of the Mississippi River were asked to stay
away from work Monday through Wednesday, except those at
Westmoreland Coal Co., which used its memorial days in April.
   More than 37,000 miners have been on wildcat walkouts in eight
states, protesting Pittston's refusal to sign a national contract
negotiated by the UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
As many as 16,000 miners have been on wildcat strikes in West
Virginia.
   A convoy of 80 cars and trucks from Stone, Ky., arrived for the
rally, which coincides with the end of a two-week summer vacation
for many UMW miners.
   ``This rally is showing the solidarity and support of the union
and its unity,'' said Alan DeMurray of Stone, a striking Pittston
miner.
   ``Right now, I think Pittston's pushed us as far as it can push
us,'' said DeMurray, who works at Pittston's Eastern Coal Co.
subsidiary.

   Police in this Fort Worth
suburb learned the hard way that a rose tattoo on a woman's bustline
should not necessarily be considered a unique distinguishing mark.
   Police told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Wednesday that they
were looking for a woman with a rose tattoo on her left breast who
is suspected of robbing a gas station of $8,500.
   After the paper published the information Thursday, about 300
people called police to say they knew of such a woman.
   ``I've handled at least 55 calls myself,'' said police detective
Cliff Jaynes. ``Every woman with a red rose on her has been snitched
on.''
   Police decided to release more information about the robbery
suspect that should nip further calls in the bud, the newspaper said
Saturday.
   The woman has another tattoo: a crude letter ``S'' with two
horizontal slash marks on her left forearm.

   The masters and crews of two Canadian
fishing boats seized on suspicion of illegal fishing were in Prince
Rupert, British Columbia, on Saturday, the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service said.
   Masters Bruce Devereux and Howard Wilson, and their crews, were
taken to a ferry that left here late Friday, Mike Harpold of the INS
said. Their fishing boats remained docked in Ketchikan.
   The Coast Guard on Wednesday seized the 50-foot Viscount and the
40-foot Fonzie after it said the vessels were observed fishing in
U.S. waters of Dixon Entrance, between Southeast Alaska and Canada's
Queen Charlotte Islands.
   Wilson, master of the Fonzie, said he has fished for 10 years in
the area where the boat was seized. ``I do not believe I was over
the line,'' said Wilson of Parksville, British Columbia.
   He said idling his boat was costly. ``We're losing about $3,000 a
day to sit here,'' Wilson said.
   Earlier, Devereux told Canadian Press he was roughed up by
members of the Coast Guard party that boarded his boat. Coast Guard
spokesman Ed Moreth said the Canadians filed no complaints about
their treatment.
   A federal court complaint alleging illegal fishing and seeking
forfeiture of the vessels, gear and fish on board was filed Friday
in Anchorage. Canada filed with the State Department a protest
seeking release of the vessels.
   The 4,000 pounds of salmon aboard each boat were sold to a
Ketchikan cannery, with the payment to be held in court until the
matter is resolved.

   Cecil Carpenter and Alex were inseparable
in life, and so they will be in death.
   Cecil, the ventriloquist, and Alex, the little guy made of wood,
were buried together in Goshen Cemetery on Wednesday. It seemed
fitting, the family said.
   ``I think there's only one way to go. Alex has to go with him,''
said Cecil's brother, Norman.
   Cecil and Alex, partners for 10 years, played their last show
June 30 at the annual convention of the National Ventriloquists'
Association Fort Mitchell, Ky. After the performance, Cecil, 54,
collapsed and died.
   The ventriloquist's daughter, Sheila, said she probably was the
only dissenter when the family first talked about burying Alex with
her father. She thought a museum would be the best place for Alex.
   ``Then I changed my mind,'' she said. ``I got to thinking that
without my dad, he's nothing.''
   Norman Carpenter said any time his brother talked about himself
he always talked about Alex, too. ``They were a pair, like Lewis and
Martin, Abbott and Costello.''
   Gary Carpenter, Cecil's youngest son, said Alex's name always was
included on family Christmas cards. ``I remember when we all went to
California in 1981. ... we had to take stuff out of the car to make
room for Alex,'' he added.
   Sheila said Alex was like a little brother to her. She said that
when her father's work as a plumber took him out of town he would
take Alex with him. She said he entertained on his lunch break and
went to nursing homes to entertain after work.
   ``We enjoyed him and he was always around when we were kids,''
Warren Carpenter, Cecil's oldest son, said of Alex. ``One thing
about Dad was that he loved to make people happy.''
   Carpenter drove with his wife, Mary, to Fort Mitchell on June 29,
the day after he was released from St. Vincent Hospital in
Indianapolis, where he had been a patient for three weeks with a
heart ailment.
   Mrs. Carpenter then returned home, planning to pick up her
husband when the convention ended. Carpenter earlier had confided to
his brother about his heart problems and said he didn't think he had
much time left to live.
   He was ``very serious and very direct,'' Norman Carpenter said.
   Carl Brandenburg, also a ventriloquist and brother of Norman's
wife, said he saw Cecil and Alex's last performance. He said Cecil
sat down four or five times during the show and slurred some of his
words. Cecil apologized to the audience, explaining that he didn't
feel well, Brandenburg said.
   ``He was making people smile even in his last hours,'' the Rev.
Mark Minear said at the funeral service. ``He was a dearly loved man
and he dearly loved people. He and Alex brought many smiles to many
people.''

   The Supreme Court's abortion ruling last week did not quell
protesters on both sides of the issue who gathered outside clinics
across the country Saturday to press their cases.
   At least 115 abortion opponents were arrested Saturday in
Milwaukee and Denver. Anti-abortion demonstrations in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island were up-staged by pro-abortion-rights groups, and
some 900 people from both camps surrounded a California clinic in a
protest that was described as peaceful.
   Protesters also gathered in Chicago, Miami, Phoenix, Jackson,
Miss., and Vancouver, British Columbia, where the court's ruling
does not have any effect.
   Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a Missouri law
restricting abortion doesn't seem to have cooled the rhetoric.
Abortion rights supporters see the ruling as a threat to overturn
Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 case making abortions legal, while abortion
opponents say the court didn't go far enough.
   ``Babies are still being killed in America,'' said the Rev. Don
Sailer, a Baptist Minister from West Bend, Wis., at the protest in
Milwaukee. He said anti-abortion protesters would face arrest and
injury for their cause.
   In Denver, mounted police and canine teams bolstered police who
removed Operation Rescue protesters Saturday morning after they
tried to block entrances to a Planned Parenthood clinic. There was
pushing and shoving as escorts locked arms, surrounded about four
patients and helped them into the clinic.
   The 60 arrested were charged with trespassing, disobedience of a
lawful order and loitering and were taken to the Denver County Jail,
police said.
   About 250 protesters stayed several hours more, walking along the
sidewalk around the facility, signing hymns and praying, but by
about noon they had dispersed, police said.
   Lisa Dotur, spokeswoman for Operation Rescue in Colorado,
defended the altercations. ``People are deeply concerned about
children who are in imminent danger of death,'' she said.
   In Milwaukee, by midday 57 anti-abortion activists were arrested
as about 300 people on both sides of the issue demonstrated. Police
said the arrested would be charged with disorderly conduct or
trespassing, or possibly both.
   In Tustin, Calif., about 900 demonstrators surrounded the Santa
Ana-Tustin Medical Pavilion, which offers abortions among its
services.
   Acting Police Chief Fred Wakefield said there appreared to be
equal numbers of protesters and counter-protesters. As of midday,
the demonstation was described as orderly.
   ``They are willing to stay there and shut the clinic down,'' said
Jim Cuthbertson, spokesman for Operation Rescue. ``We'll stay there
as long as necessary.''
   However, members of the Feminist Majority escorted patients and
clinic staff into the clinic, said Kathy Spillar, the group's
national coordinator.
   In Brookline, Mass., an expected anti-abortion protest turned
into a rally for about 300 demonstrators for abortion rights, who
crowded sidewalks and the street near three abortion clinics while
about a dozen anti-abortion activists handed out leaflets.
   ``We got the word out,'' said Ellen Convisser, president of the
Boston chapter of the National Organization for Women. ``We appeared
and they didn't.''
   A few minor scuffles took place outside one clinic, and police
were posted in force with arrest-wagons and ambulances. But by
midday no arrests or injuries were reported.
   In Cranston, R.I., when a carload of anti-abortion demonstrators
pulled up at a clinic and found close to 70 abortion rights
advocates waiting for them. A clinic spokeswoman said the pro-life
activists decided to wait for reinforcements, who did not arrive.
   Police Sgt. William Burroughs said the demonstration broke up
about at midmorning with no arrests.
   Abortion rights demonstrators and their opponents faced off in
front of a Chicago clinic before police arrested 61 people,
physically removing many who blocked the building's doors.
   About 200 people from each side chanted and sang as police hauled
anti-abortion protesters from the entrance of the Michigan Avenue
Medical Center for Women.
   Most of those arrested were anti-abortion protesters blocking the
door. They were charged with mob action and resisting arrest, said
Deputy Chief John Walsh.
   Of 70 women who had appointments for gynecological services
including abortions, about two-thirds showed up, said clinic
spokesman Tom Masloski.
   A two-hour standoff by abortion foes at Today's Woman Medical
Center in Miami ended with 27 arrests, police said. Members of
Operation Rescue South Florida said they targeted the clinic because
it allegedly performs abortions up to 24 weeks into pregnancy.
   Part of the Missouri law upheld by the Supreme Court required
medical tests on any fetus thought to be at least 20 weeks old to
determine if it can survive on its own.
   ``The Supreme Court has indicated that abortions after 20 weeks
of viability testing may be illegal,'' said the Rev. Patrick
Mahoney, director of Operation Rescue. ``When we get arrested, that
will be our defense.''
   Most of the anti-abortion activists sprawled on the ground in
front of the clinic and went limp when officers moved in to make
arrests. About 100 abortion rights demonstrators picketed across the
street.
   In Phoenix, about 200 protesters gathered outside the Metro
Phoenix Women's Clinic. No arrests were made but clinic employees
said about 40 percent of their appointments were no-shows.
   About 110 anti-abortion protesters peacefully picketed outside
the Mississippi Women's Medical Clinic in Jackson, Miss.
   In Vancouver, B.C., several anti-abortion protesters were
arrested in front of a clinic in the second blockade of the facility
this week. The protests were not related to the U.S. court's ruling.
   The clinic, the only privately funded abortion facility in
British Columbia, has been the site of protests since it opened last
year.

   Police shot and killed a just-fired Coca-Cola
plant worker Saturday after the man killed two co-workers, seized
and released a hostage, and emerged after seven hours with guns
blazing.
   ``They had no choice but to return the fire,'' Cobb County Police
Chief Culver Johnson said.
   John Wallace, 45, shot two men, briefly held another employee
hostage and then blockaded himself in an office at the Coca-Cola
West Metro Sales Center, Johnson said.
   Wallace negotiated with police in this northern Atlanta suburb
for most of the night. Around 5 a.m. police fired tear gas into the
building and Wallace agreed to come out without his guns, Johnson
said. But Wallace emerged firing his two guns at police, who shot
him.
   Wallace was taken to Cobb General Hospital, where he later died,
according to nursing supervisor Linda Cole.
   Police identified the slain co-workers as Maurice McCluskey, 34,
of Decatur and Alvin C. Parson, 27, of Powder Springs.
   Johnson said it was not immediately clear why Wallace was fired
from his job as a route salesman. Cobb County police Sgt. Mike Hicks
said McCluskey apparently was the superior who handled Wallace's
termination, and Parson was a co-worker.
   Wallace was told to clean out his locker when he arrived for work
around 10 p.m. Instead, he left and returned with guns and began
firing at workers at the plant, Johnson said.
   Later, a caller telephoned WSB-TV in Atlanta and identified
himself as Wallace, telling reporters he had shot two men. Police
said officials at the station initially acted as negotiators by
telephone.
   David Kenney, an associate producer at WSB, said the caller said
he worked 23 years for the company and said he shot the plant
manager who fired him and his supervisor.
   At one point during the night, Wallace took another man hostage
for more than an hour after the shootings, then released him. The
hostage was not identified.
   Eddie Wallace said his uncle ``felt like he didn't have any
alternative'' after losing his job.
   ``He felt like he'd rather be dead than start all over again. All
of a sudden someone tells you you don't have a job, and he just
snapped,'' said Eddie Wallace.

<TEXT>
   Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis'
conservative-communist coalition won a vote of confidence from
Parliament early Sunday and a mandate to investigate political
scandals.
   The coalition, comprised of the conservative New Democracy party
and the communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress, has
pledged it will complete its work in three months and call general
elections in October.
   The government said its main task will be to investigate former
officials of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement accused of
involvement in banking, financial and agricultural scandals. The
Socialists came in a distant second to the conservatives in the June
18 election.
   The coalition government was formed because no party one an
absolute majority in parliament.
   Parliament began debate on the new government's policy on
Thursday and completed it at midnight Saturday with a confidence
vote of 174-124.
   Absent from the roll call balloting was former Socialist Premier
Andreas Papandreou, who is recuperating at home after spending two
weeks in a hospital with pneumonia and kidney problems. One member
of the Coalition of Left and Progress abstained.
   New Democracy proposed on Friday that six Socialists, including
Papandreou, be investigated for alleged involvement in major
scandals during their eight years in office. All have denied any
wrongdoing.
   One scandal involves the embezzlement of $200 million from the
Bank of Crete.
   Papandreou issued a statement that said the coalition
government's plans were a ``new attempt to politically execute me.''
   He also accused it of ``violating elementary political and human
rights by shamelessly trying, without any evidence, to adopt the
months-long lies of the concerted mud slurring and libelous reports,
under the mantle of Parliament.''

   A federal judge ordered a publishing company
to put stickers on its 1990 calendars to warn consumers that the
pictures were ``printed from copies of Ansel Adams photographs.''
   ``You can't pass off reconstituted photos as original and
mislead, knowingly or unwittingly, the purchasing public,'' U.S.
District Judge William D. Keller told Day Dream Publishing Inc.'s
lawyers Friday.
   Attorneys for Adams' estate and publisher filed suit against Day
Dream after the Santa Barbara publisher announced plans to publish a
book of Adams' photos obtained from the National Archives.
   The book and 1990 calendars by Day Dream bear the title, ``The
Mural Project,'' and include photographs the late Adams took for the
U.S. Interior Department to make mural-size prints to decorate
department buildings.
   Day Dream produced the book and calendars by re-photographing
images Adams had printed for the government in 1941-1942. Day Dream
lawyers argued that the images existed in the public domain.
   While prints of ``The Mural Project'' are easily available from
the government, Adams kept the negatives.
   Keller's ruling did not affect distribution and promotion of the
book because the attorneys agreed that all copies were sold or
already on store shelves. About half of the 122,000 calendars
printed also were already distributed.

Saturday during the group's triennial convention.
   Bohlmann, 57, of St. Louis, was elected on the first ballot with
a 52.4 percent majority, or 589 votes. The closest contender was Dr.
Robert C. Sauer of St. Charles, Mo., who received 38.52 percent, or
433 votes. Sauer is a former vice president of the synod.
   Bohlmann was president of Concordia Seminary in St. Louis before
he was elected to head the synod in 1981 when he was part of a
conservative movement.
   Some conservatives in the church, who contend Bohlmann has become
too moderate, led an effort to unseat the president at the 1986
convention but narrowly failed.
   Other nominees for president were Dr. Eugene W. Bunkowske, a
professor at Concordia Theological Seminary, Fort Wayne, Ind.; Dr.
George F. Wollenburg, synod second vice president, Billings, Mont.;
and Dr. Robert D. Preus, president of the Fort Wayne seminary.
   The Lutheran Church-Missouri synod has its headquarters in St.
Louis and is the second-largest Lutheran church body in the United
States with 2.6 million members and more than 6,000 congregations.

<HEAD>Koch to Grant Mourning Leave to Unmarried Couples and Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Saturday he will issue
an executive order granting bereavement leave rights to homosexuals
and unmarried heterosexuals whose ``domestic partners'' die.
   The mayor told The Associated Press that the city also would
consider extending health insurance benefits to the same city
workers included in the bereavement order in the next collective
bargaining session with unions.
   Koch said he would issue the order within several weeks. City
workers currently are granted four days leave to mourn the death of
any relative living in the same house.
   The Daily News in its Sunday editions said the executive order
would set the stage for allowing unmarried and unrelated life
partners the same health and insurance benefits as are granted to
married couples.
   But, the mayor emphasized, ``It will be up to the unions and
pressure by union members to expand the health benefits. I'm only
talking about bereavement leave in my executive order.''
   The mayor noted that the pool of money available for city
employees would not grow significantly. Union negotiators would have
to choose if they wanted pay increases or the health benefits for
their members, Koch said.
   The mayor said the next union negotiations are not scheduled
until next year, after the mayoral elections.
   The mayor said his executive order or the collective bargaining
measure does not mean he recognizes gay marriages.
   ``This has nothing to do with gay marriages,'' he said. ``I'm
against that. This is a different concept. This is closer to what
the Court of Appeals did.''
   The state's highest court on Thursday ruled that a partner in a
long-term homosexual relationship can take over his or her partner's
rent-controlled apartment when the leaseholder dies.

<HEAD>1,600 Pounds of Cocaine Dropped Off Cuban Coast, Feds Say</HEAD>

   Federal agents recovered 1,600 pounds of cocaine
Saturday from a speedboat observed earlier in Cuban waters catching
bales dropped from a suspected drug-running plane, authorities said.
   U.S. Customs Service surveillance planes watched the drop off the
northern coast of Cuba late Friday night, the same day Cuba
announced four military officers were sentenced to death for drug
trafficking.
   ``This shows the pattern is still continuing,'' said Patrick
O'Brien, U.S. Customs special agent-in-charge for South Florida.
``The crackdown in Cuba has done little to stop the flow of drugs.''
   Customs followed the suspected drug plane over Cuban waters and
watched it drop 18 bales to a waiting speedboat, O'Brien said.
   ``Two MiG fighters came on to the scene and protected the Cuban
airspace,'' O'Brien said. ``We had to get out of there, but before
we left we got a good look at the plane and the boat below.''
   Saturday morning, an abandoned 37-foot speedboat with bales of
cocaine floating nearby were found in Biscayne Bay, 20 miles south
of Miami. The 1,584 pounds of cocaine was valued at about $10
million, O'Brien said.
   O'Brien said the seizure is significant because it follows a
Cuban crackdown on drugs that has reached the highest levels of the
communist island nation's government.
   Cuban radio announced Friday that former Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa
and three other military officers were sentenced to death for a
conspiracy to smuggle cocaine from Colombia's Medellin Cartel
through Cuban to the United States.
   Saturday's seizure followed one of the nation's largest cocaine
finds aboard a Panamanian freighter intercepted off Key West. The
freighter, bound for the Dominican Republic and boarded by Customs
agents Thursday, had 3,359 pounds of cocaine, officials said.

   Thousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke
Saturday in seven states in the West, threatening homes in some
places, and firefighters contended with wind and high temperatures.
   ``As the day heats up, you'll get these reburns going out and the
trees dry out and they'll torch,'' said Forest Service spokesman Ed
Christian in Wyoming.
   ``We hope Mother Nature cooperates with us,'' said Mary Plumb of
the federal Bureau of Land Management in Utah.
   Record highs included 97 at Cheyenne, Wyo., and 100 at Denver,
while Casper, Wyo., tied its record of 100. That was Denver's fifth
consecutive day at 100 degrees or higher.
   Fire crews were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona, California and Washington. Elsewhere, four big fires burned
in interior Alaska, one having charred an estimated 24,000 acres. A
fire in Georgia's Okefenoke swamp that burned 500 acres of habitat
for an endangered species of woodpecker was reported contained
Saturday.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates
federal firefighting efforts, listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on the
fire lines, along with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10
helicopters, spokesman Arnold Hartigan said Saturday.
   So far this fire season, the agency has had 31,000 fires
reported, which have burned 1,117,000 acres. In the same period last
year, it had 54,000 fires but 765,000 acres burned.
   The fact that there are more acres burned this year, but fewer
fires, ``means this year's fires are in very rugged, inaccessible
terrain, which makes them hard to fight,'' said Hartigan. ``Also,
some of them are in areas where there have not been any fires for
years, and that means there is excellent fuel available.''
   The largest fire in the Lower 48 states was the week-old Diamond
Peak fire in Utah, which had burned 12,200 acres of forest and brush
in an area 20 miles west of the Utah-Colorado border, just north of
Interstate 70.
   It was 80 percent contained, but after a week of temperatures
around 100 degrees, the National Weather Service predicted possible
dry lightning storms and gusting wind.
   Elsewhere in Utah, the Uinta Canyon fire had burned 3,850 acres
20 miles north of Roosevelt in the Ashley National Forest. Forest
Service spokeswoman Cece Stewart said three helicopters scattered
incendiary bombs made of chemically treated plastic balls on an
unburned 200-acre area between fire lines and the main fire in an
effort to stop the fire's advance.
   High wind also was expected in northern California, where a
2,500-acre fire near Janesville on the eastern slopes of the Sierra
Nevada destroyed two mobile homes. U.S. 395 between Milford and
Janesville was closed.
   ``The wind was pretty brisk. It just blew the fire and pushed it
out,'' said Forest Service spokesman Dave Reider.
   Relentless winds first pushed the fire north, then south,
prompting Sheriff Ron Jarrel to order the evacuation of a sparsely
populated area about a mile south of the fire line, Reider said. It
was unknown how many people were affected.
   Spokesman Larry Lathrop said a helicopter battling the fire
crashed Saturday about four miles southeast of Janesville.
   Lathrop said the pilot walked away from the crash, but the
helicopter was destroyed. The chopper apparently was making a water
drop when it crashed.
   In the Sierra foothills near Oroville, north of Sacramento, a
750-acre fire was contained Saturday after burning four homes, six
outbuildings and six vehicles, and forcing about 150 residents to
flee briefly Friday night, according to the California Department of
Forestry.
   Firefighters gained the upper hand on a trio of forest fires in
Colorado's drought-stricken mountains Saturday, but a new blaze of
an estimated 3,000 acres in grass and timber on the eastern plains
had crews scrambling to protect a subdivision in Elbert County.
   Residents of nine homes in the subdivision about 25 miles
northeast of Kiowa were evacuated Friday night, but later were
allowed to return home.
   In the Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming, a fire
had grown to 3,420 acres, burning an additional 1,000 acres in 24
hours, according to forest officials. Forest spokesman Ed Christian
said the fire was about 50 percent contained by Saturday night and
that with some cooperation from the weather, crews should be able to
complete their containment line by Monday.
   Officials in Arizona gave priority to the Marijilda fire, which
had blackened 2,500 acres of forest on the north side of Mount
Graham near Safford, and the Chiva fire east of Tucson, which had
burned 8,300 acres in the Rincon Mountains, according to BLM
spokesman Wendell Peacock.
   Arizona's largest fire until Saturday, in the Peloncillo
Mountains south of Duncan, along the Arizona-New Mexico border, had
charred 8,000 acres but was 80 percent contained.
   Firefighters spent an eighth day Saturday battling the
lightning-caused, 8,139-acre Divide fire 50 miles northeast of
Silver City in the Gila National Forest in southwestern New Mexico,
U.S. Forest Service officials said.
   Firefighters in north-central Washington encircled a 4,500-acre
range fire early Saturday.

   A retired Army officer was convicted in
federal court Saturday of giving military secrets to a defense
contractor.
   The jury deliberated 30 minutes before finding retired Lt. Col
Kenneth Lee Landon, 47, of Enterprise guilty of both charges against
him _ conspiracy and conversion of a government document.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina allowed Landon to remain free on
$20,000 unsecured bond and did not immediately set a sentencing
date. Landon faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and fined
$500,000.
   Landon had no comment after the trial, but in testimony Friday
said he did not feel what he did was morally wrong and, if the
circumstances were the same, ``I'd do it again.''
   Landon admitted that in 1985, while stationed at Fort Rucker in
southeast Alabama, he gave the Army's Anti-Armor Master Plan to
then-Rockwell International executive Hewitt ``Buck'' Lovelace.
   He said he believed a Rockwell competitor, Martin-Marietta,
already had the 135-page document and he wanted to make sure the two
companies were competing on equal terms.
   ``I thought it was in the best interest of the U.S. Army and the
U.S. government,'' Landon testified. He said he did not steal the
document and did not trade it for promises of a job at Rockwell.
   Lovelace, 43, of Lawrenceville, Ga., pleaded guilty June 24 to
conversion of a government document. He could be sentenced to 10
years in prison and fined $250,000.
   He testifed Thursday that he received the plan from Landon in the
parking lot of the Dothan Airport on Aug. 30, 1985, took it to his
Georgia home, hid it for a week and then gave it to a Rockwell
operations analyst.

<TEXT>
   U.S. intelligence officials have identified four
terrorists allegedly responsible for planting the bomb that
destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 last December, a London newspaper
reported Sunday.
   The weekly Sunday Telegraph quoted unidentified officials as
saying the key figure in the attack was Hafez Kassem el-Dalkamuni, a
43-year-old Palestinian from the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   The paper said he is in prison in West Germany awaiting trial for
possession of explosives.
   All 259 people aboard flight 103 and 11 people on the ground were
killed when the plane exploded over Lockerbie, in Scotland on Dec.
21. The new York-bound flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany,
with a stopover at London's Heathrow airport.
   The newspaper said 21-year-old Khalid Jaafar of Lebanon, a second
suspected member of the Popular Front, is dead. He apparently was on
Flight 103 when it exploded, the newspaper said.
   The paper said that at first Jaafar was thought to be an
unwitting courier of the bomb. But ``intelligence officials have now
discovered a link between Jaafar and the PFLP-GC and suspect that he
was knowingly involved in the operation.''
   The paper said two other suspects, both members of the Popular
Front, were held briefly by West German police on explosives
charges, then released for lack of evidence before the bombing.
   ``They are now believed to be in a Scandinavian country, which
has been alerted by the United States,'' the paper said.``American
officials hope for an early arrest and will then seek their
extradition.''
   The paper did not identify the Scandinavian country and gave no
further details about the case.

   A group of 10 Americans Saturday toured a military
laser research center previously considered central to the Soviet
version of the U.S. anti-missile Star Wars program, according to
reports published Sunday.
   The Americans, including two physicists, three members of
Congress and two journalists, were the first foreigners allowed
inside the Shary-Shagan complex, located in Soviet Central Asia,
according to the New York Times.
   The Associated Press was not invited to participate.
   The tour included a look at a military laser once described by
the Pentagon as an operable anti-satellite weapon. But the American
visitors concluded the laser is probably too weak to damage U.S.
satellites.
   ``It seems to me it pretty clearly is not a power laser and
doesn't represent any threat as a weapon,'' Rep. Jim Olin, D-Va.,
told the New York Times. Olin is a former electrical engineer for
General Electric Co.
   ``If they wanted to have an anti-satellite program, this research
_ locating and tracking objects in space _ is certainly
applicable,'' he said. ``But it sure doesn't look like a beam
weapon.''
   The tour of the complex was part of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness. The Soviet president
has called for reduction in conventional and nuclear forces and
doing away with the NATO and Warsaw Pact military groups that divide
Europe.
   Sary-Shagan has been an object of U.S. interest since 1984, when
the Pentagon published information about the compound based on
satellite photographs and identified it as the heart of an
``ominous'' laser weapons research and development program, the
paper said.
   It formed the heart of an aggressive campaign to justify
President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars,
in 1985.
   ``It's incredible to think that the Pentagon S.D.I. folks
probably got an extra $10 billion because of this place,'' Frank Von
Hippel, a Princeton University physicist who was among those touring
the facility, told the New York Times.
   ``It looks like a tool that's been left out to dry for 25 years.
It's got 19 counter-top-sized ruby laser, a welding-sized laser,
1960s vintage computers and a couple of one-meter mirrors in an
air-conditioned building,'' Von Hippel told the Washington Post.
   On Friday, the visiting Americans were the first to enter the
Kyshtym nuclear complex in the Ural mountains where the Soviet Union
has produced plutonium for its nuclear weapons since 1948, according
to the New York Times.
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that the Soviet government
has decided to shut down all five nuclear reactors producing
plutonium for nuclear weapons at the top-secret military center.
   Gorbachev said three months ago that three reactors would be
closed out of an estimated 13 throughout the country.

<HEAD>Pipeline Regulations Called `Regulatory Black Hole'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vague laws have left underground
pipelines ``a regulatory black hole,'' a congressman said Friday as
hearings began in the gasoline pipeline explosion that killed two
people, injured 31 and destroyed 10 homes.
   ``It appears that the end result is the companies are regulating
themselves,'' said Rep. George E. Brown Jr. as the House Public
Works and Transportation Committee's investigative subcommittee
convened.
   The May 25 gasoline pipeline explosion devastated the San
Bernardino neighborhood of Muscoy 13 days after a runaway Southern
Pacific train derailed on a curve and slammed into the same
neighborhood.
   The train wreck was blamed for the damaging the 14-inch gasoline
line of Calnev Pipe Line Co. Residents had been assured the
neighborhood was safe, although they insisted before the explosion
that they could smell gasoline.
   So haphazard is pipeline regulation, the committee noted, that
the state fire marshal's office had no record of the Calnev line,
even though it supplies 90 percent of the gasoline to the city of
Las Vegas, Nev. and nearly all the jet fuel to George and Edwards
air force bases.
   ``This scenario has presented us with a regulatory black hole,''
said Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, chairman of the subcomittee.
   The hearing began with dozens of residents of the devastated
Muscoy neighborhood looking on. Testimony was expected from several
officials, including City Attorney James Penman, who fought in state
and federal court to stop the line from being restored along the
same course.
   Calnev agreed to numerous suggestions and complied with
guidelines set up by federal officials to restore the pipeline, but
insisted on restoring the pipeline along its original course through
the neighorhood.
   State and federal judges told the city they could do nothing to
change Calnev's plans.

   Rockets, grenades and cartridges
littered the Samarkhiel garrison, which Moslem guerrillas captured
in March and used as a base for the siege of Jalalabad until the
army drove them out this week.
   Journalists were taken on a tour Friday of former guerrilla bases
east of Jalalabad, where fierce battles between the army and
insurgents were reported Wednesday.
   At one point, an Afghan officer shouted: ``Stop! There may be
land mines!'' He tiptoed forward on a narrow road near a lumber mill.
   Government troops were in complete control of Jalalabad and of
Samarkhiel, seven miles to the southeast, and other rebel bases
nearby. Lt. Gen. Manoky Mangal said soldiers were advancing to
destroy guerrilla bases near the Pakistani border.
   Jalalabad, on the main route from Kabul to the Khyber Pass and
Pakistan, is 75 miles east of the Afghan capital and 45 miles from
the border.
   ``Once again they dreamed to occupy Jalalabad, but once again we
have destroyed them,'' Mangal said. He is military governor of
Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is the capital.
   Moslem insurgents, who began fighting after a communist coup in
April 1978, attacked Jalalabad on March 7. It was their first major
assault the withdrawal of Soviet military forces from Afghanistan
was completed Feb. 15, ending nine years of involvement in the civil
war.
   Journalists representing Western media were flown to Jalalabad in
a Soviet-built Afghan air force helicopter.
   Amanullah Nooro, the 35-year-old pilot, fired rockets and dropped
flares to frustrate any attempt by guerrillas to attack the chopper.
Four helicopter gunships flew escort.
   Mangal said at least 2,000 insurgents had been killed and 4,000
wounded in the operation around Jalalabad, and gave government
casualties as 26 dead.
   Both sides customarily exaggerate enemy losses and minimize their
own.
   The government offensive began after reports that the U.S.-backed
guerrillas were preparing new attacks on Jalalabad. Capturing the
city, Afghanistan's fifth-largest, would have given them a seat for
the interim government they formed in Pakistan after the Soviet
withdrawal.
   ``We had information that the enemy was regrouping and planning
anoher attack on Jalalabad,'' said Mangal, a 41-year-old former
physician who joined the army after the coup in 1978.
   ``We decided to strike first,'' he said. ``Our strategy paid off
and now we are heading toward the bases on the border with
Pakistan.''

   An anti-prostitution group has criticized Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno for allegedly keeping paid mistresses in a
letter sent to women's groups in the industrialized countries
meeting next week in Paris, according to news reports Friday.
   Kyodo News Service said the Study Group for Prostitution Problems
sent letters Friday to 77 women's organizations in the United
States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   Japan is the seventh member of the group of industrialized
countries whose leaders will meet in Paris next week.
   ``We want you all to know what kind of person Prime Minister Uno
really is,'' Kyodo quoted the letter as saying. ``Even though the
prime minister has been accused of keeping paid mistresses,
including a geisha, he has kept being evasive without clearly
denying it.''
   Uno has denied doing anything immoral. He has refused to comment
further since the allegations first were made last month.
   The letter also said the group was demanding Uno's resignation,
Kyodo reported. The group was not available to confirm the report
Friday night.

   Seabrook nuclear power plant officials
acknowledged Friday they can't meet their goal of having the $6.1
billion reactor running commercially by year's end.
   But they still hope to get their full-power license by then and
produce electricity a month into the new year.
   Plant officials reassessed their timetable after a Nuclear
Regulatory Commission licensing board, in a report dated Thursday
and released Friday, said it won't be able to rule before Nov. 30 on
evacuation plans for Seabrook.
   The commission had pressed the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
for a ruling by Sept. 30.
   Even though the board said in May it probably would not meet that
target, on Friday a recorded telephone information line at Seabrook
still said commercial operation was expected ``later this year.''
   After the board rules, the commission would decide whether to
give Seabrook the commercial license it hoped to have 10 years ago.
Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher estimated Friday the commission would
take a month to decide.
   Seabrook foes vow to challenge any license in federal court.
There has been one precedent for staying a full-power license, a
four-month delay for the Diablo Canyon plant in California, though
that reactor eventually was allowed to run commercially.
   Once Seabrook gets final approval, Sher estimated it would take
about one month to get the reactor to 10 percent power and start
providing electricity to the region. He said it would take several
months to reach 100 percent power.
   The licensing board is deciding the adequacy of Seabrook's
evacuation plans for six Massachusetts communities within 10 miles
of the plant that refuse to cooperate.
   It also is to give a final grade on a June 1988 federal exercise
of those plans and evacuation plans that New Hampshire developed for
its 17 communities in the 10-mile zone.
   Hearings on those issues concluded last week after 57 days.
   Chairman Ivan Smith said the Nov. 30 target disregards
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon's plans to call for
hearings on a reactor shutdown last month during low-power testing.
Seabrook officials admit they wrongly delayed the shutdown, and the
NRC took the unusual step of suspending the low-power tests.
   Steve Jonas, an assistant Massachusetts attorney general, said he
was pleased by Smith's report.
   ``We think it also confirms what we've been saying for some time,
which is these matters are more complex than (Seabrook) seems to
recognize. They're not going to get the license as quickly as they
think,'' Jonas said. He said the plant's past projections have
proved ``whoppingly wrong.''

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ The captain and mate of a Greek tanker that
ran aground on a reef off Newport, spilling 420,000 gallons of
heating oil, were not drinking or using drugs at the time, according
to test results released Friday.
   ``We have preliminary results that are negative,'' said Mike
Benson, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board in
Washington, D.C. ``We're not going to comment beyond that.''
   Benson said the tests, performed at the University of Utah, would
be run a second time for confirmation. He did not know all the drugs
for which the blood was screened.
   The tests confirmed the observations of Gov. Edward D. DiPrete
and Coast Guard officers who boarded the World Prodigy after it
slammed into Brenton Reef June 23. They said Capt. Iakovos
Georgudis, 43, did not appear impaired.
   Georgudis admitted he simply made a mistake and navigated the
ship onto the reef at the mouth of Narragansett Bay, DiPrete said. A
helmsman told a Coast Guard-NTSB investigating panel he saw the red
warning buoy on the wrong side of the ship, but did not tell the
captain.
   The World Prodigy did not have a harbor pilot on board at the
time. Pilots are required for commercial ships to navigate the bay.
   The spill was cleaned up with little immediate environmental
damage, although scientists still are monitoring for long-term
damage to fish and lobster larvae and the small plants and animals
on which they feed. The Coast Guard estimated the cleanup cost
almost $2 million.
   Georgudis faces two misdemeanor charges of violating federal
pollution laws, but a grand jury is investigating to determine if
there was gross negligence, which could elevate the charges to
felonies.
   Because of a mixup at the time, usable blood samples were not
taken until 19 hours after the accident, but officials said they
still could be used for screening.
   A state grand jury investigating possible violations of state
pollution or pilotage laws met again Friday and heard testimony from
the Coast Guard and a lobsterman who saw the grounding, said Lee
Baker, an attorney general's spokeswoman.
   It is not expected to hear any more witnesses when it reconvenes
next week, she said.
   The World Prodigy arrived Monday at a New York City drydock for
repairs.

<HEAD>Scores of Brush and Range Fires Char Thousands of Acres in U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE total land consumed; ADDS details on
fires in Washington and Colorado. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An army of firefighters renewed its offensive Friday against four
wildfires that charred more than 16,000 acres in Utah, but weekend
forecasts for wind and lightning had some Western authorities
worried about the threat of new fires.
   ``We're just scared to death, to tell you the truth,'' said Ray
Tate of the Bureau of Land Management's Vernal, Utah, office.
   Forest and range fires have burned more than 25,000 acres of land
in Arizona, and 23 new fires began Thursday and Friday from
lightning strikes in New Mexico, bringing the total number of blazes
burning to at least 55.
   In south-central Alaska, the Swinging Dome Fire about 200 miles
west of Anchorage grew to 11,000 acres and was fought by three
16-person crews, with another seven crews expected, state foresters
said.
   Fires also charred land in California, Colorado, Georgia, Wyoming
and Washington.
   And though firefighters reported progress against some fires,
National Weather Service officials said they faced a weekend of
continued heat and storms that could reignite blazes and cause new
ones.
   In Utah, the Diamond Peak fire, 20 miles west of the Colorado
border and just north of Interstate 70, had consumed 9,500 acres.
Four fresh 20-member crews were fighting the blaze, bringing to 400
the number of people on the line.
   Three fires burned in Ashley National Forest, in northeastern
Utah. Containment of the nearly 1,400-acre Rough Canyon fire just
south of Duchesne was expected Saturday, and major assaults were
launched on the Uinta Canyon fire, which has consumed 3,600 acres,
and the Six Mile Creek fire, which has scorched 1,200 acres.
   In Wyoming, 500 firefighters battled a 2,400-acre fire in
Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest. Fire containment lines had
been dug around 25 percent of the blaze, which began Tuesday.
Officials said containment wasn't expected before late next week.
   ``The potential is for very high fire danger by the weekend,''
said forest spokesman Ed Christian. ``It's going to be low humidity,
high temperatures and probably some moderate winds in there.
Hopefully they can hold what they've gained.''
   In Arizona, temperatures above 100 degrees, low humidity and
extended drought conditions were largely responsible for the
increased dryness, officials said.
   Coronado National Forest Supervisor Jim Abbott said the Marijilda
fire that consumed 2,200 acres, and the 3,000-acre Chiva fire in the
Rincon Mountains near Redington Pass east of Tucson, were being
given top priority.
   He said the Marijilda fire was being fought with 260
firefighters, five air tankers and four helicopters and was of
special concern because of fears it could spread upward from its
present 7,000-foot level to the habitat of an endangered red
squirrel.
   Officials said the 376,000 acres closed to public recreational
use will remain closed until dampened by rain.
   None of the fires was in populated areas. Gov. Rose Mofford took
an aerial tour of some of the fires on Friday and characterized the
situation as serious but not disastrous.
   A 7,700-acre fire along the Great Divide in southwestern New
Mexico that has been raging out of control since Monday should be
contained by next Monday, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim
Payne.
   In Georgia, a 500-acre fire that broke out when lightning struck
in the Okefenokee Swamp in Fargo was 15 percent contained, said
Chris Zajicek, fire information officer for the U.S. Forest Service.
   In Washington, a range fire fanned by gusting winds spread over
1,000 acres south of Omak, and the Okanogan County Sheriff's
Department evacuated some people from their homes.
   The fire in north central Washington began Friday, and 20-25 mph
winds spread it rapidly, Department of Natural Resources spokesman
Bill Wilburn said.
   There were no injuries nor reports of structural damage, but some
county roads north of the blaze had been closed.
   In Hurlton, Calif., a brush fire whipped by hot winds burned out
of control, consumed nearly 200 acres and destroyed four homes.
Several structures were ordered evacuated, including a day care
center, authorities said.
   Karen Terrill, a spokeswoman for the state Forestry Department,
said six tankers, three helicopters, 35 engines and 10 hand crews
were on the scene about 65 miles north of Sacramento. Fifty
additional engines had been requested, she said.

<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German ship loaded with a mustard gas
component produced in India has returned to Bombay from Dubai, where
the shipment was halted, a port official said Friday.
   The Seacrest Pioneer carrying thionyl chloride entered Indian
territorial waters on Thursday and was now anchored about 1{ miles
off the Bombay Port, dock manager George Mampilli said.
   He said the thionyl chloride would be unloaded Sunday or Monday.
   The chemical, used to make pesticides, was manufactured by the
Bombay-based Transpec company and a West German company, Rheineisen
Chemical Products, contracted to deliver more than 250 tons of it to
Iran.
   Rheineisen halted the shipment at Dubai when West German
prosecutors opened a criminal investigation of the transaction.
   Rheineisen official Mojtar Ashtari said last week the company had
no indication the shipment might be used to produce poison gas.

   President Bush's proposal to link a pay raise
for top government officials with a requirement they be evaluated
every three years is being criticized by the chairman of a House
civil service subcommittee.
   Rep. Gary L. Ackerman, D-N.Y., chairman of a panel that oversees
federal pay, claims the plan would inject even more partisanship
into the federal personnel structure than exists already.
   ``It creates a system in which there will be a political litmus
test. People will have to snooker up to their supervisors and kiss
their rings to keep their pay raises,'' Ackerman said. ``That's not
what government service is all about.''
   The Bush proposal would raise salaries for senior government
executives by 8 to 25 percent. The evaluation every three years
would certify they deserve the higher salary.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp says more agency
programs may be suspended, but promises to revive the
scandal-wracked department and ``make sure the money gets to hands
of needy people, not greedy people.''
   Kemp also said Friday that his predecessor, Samuel Pierce, shares
blame for HUD's problems, which congressional and agency
investigators believe have cost the government hundreds of millions,
if not billions, of dollars.
   Kemp promised a thorough review of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development and made his most direct comments to date on his
assessment of Pierce.
   ``I'm making a lot of changes, so that, by definition, is
suggesting that Secretary Pierce unfortunately _ a very decent and
honest man _ did not in my view manage HUD as carefully or closely
as it should have been managed,'' Kemp told reporters after speaking
to a Republican group.

are ``useless in the world of politics'' and should stay home.
   The comments Friday by Hisao Horinouchi in a campaign speech for
fellow Liberal Democrats in western Mie Prefecture are bound to

he paid a geisha to be his mistress.
   Uno told reporters today he would seek an explanation from

   In an move that many economists expect will
make borrowing easier, the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions
for the second time in four weeks.
   Analysts predicted the development would send a variety of
consumer and business interest rates lower in coming weeks,
including home mortgage rates and commercial banks' prime-lending
rate.
   One analyst said a one-half percentage point reduction in the
prime rate, the benchmark rate for many consumer loans, could come
as early as Monday. The prime rate stands at 11 percent.
   ``The Fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we have
passed the peak on interest rates,'' said David Wyss, an economist
with DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting company in Lexington,

   The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact
allies on Saturday praised President Bush's NATO proposal to make
deep cuts in conventional forces and said an accord could be reached
next year.
   The East bloc allies also signed an agreement Saturday to seek a
nuclear-free Europe with significantly fewer soldiers and arms, the
official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   It calls for ``a stable and secure Europe, free from nuclear and
chemical weapons, for substantial cuts in armed forces, arms and
military spending,'' Tass said.
   In May, Bush called for military cutbacks that would fix the same
ceiling of 275,000 troops in Europe for each superpower and make
deep cuts in the number of tanks, combat aircraft and artillery.
   The Warsaw Pact countries said the Bush plan converged with their
proposals for scaling back on conventional arms in Europe and that
rapid progress in negotiating cuts was now possible.

   From San Francisco and Dallas, from small towns in

   The nation's oldest and largest civil rights group opens its

proposal was set forth by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in

was akin to the Palestinian demand, announced previously, that
elections are not feasible so long as the Israeli occupation

<HEAD>Soft Landing or Hard, There's A Price To Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only once before in the past half-century has the
economy made a truly soft landing when it was headed toward
recession. That was in 1967, and it was made possible by war.
   As the economy faded in that year, thanks as usual to tight
monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, the military buildup
provided enough thrust to keep things going. But the price was
steep, and it is still being paid.
   The price was budget deficits, and those deficits led in the
1970s to some of the worst inflation ever experienced by Americans _
month after month of double digit rates, accompanied by interest
rates that exceeded 20 percent.
   While cause-effect becomes tenuous at that point, you can argue
that the inflation and other evidence of disequilibrium in the 1970s
provoked the big recession of the early 1980s that sent unemployment
too into double digits.
   In retrospect, therefore, the wonderfully soft landing of 1967
may have done little more than spread the damage over a longer
period of time than might have been the case. Some benefit! Might a
crash have been better?
   The soft landing concept, nevertheless, is back in the news _ and
is, in fact, the subject of perhaps the most popular economic debate
of the year. The lines are drawn: Will it or will it not be a soft
landing?
   No military buildup can save the economy this time; in fact, the
trend is toward lowering military expenditures. Consumers,
two-thirds of the economy, aren't in a buying mood, and that mood
could grow gloomier if jobs are lost.
   But there is support out there, according to Roger Brinner and
David Wyss, DRI McGraw-Hill economists.
   High on their support list is the expectation that exports will
remain strong, partly because European and Japanese economies are in
a different stage of the business cycle. Their economies should
continue to grow as ours fades.
   They expect a healthy world economy will boost U.S. export
voluume 10.4 percent in 1989, less than the 18 percent growth of
1988 but still affording strong support for the gross national
product.
   In fact, they expect that exports will contribute 2.1 percentage
points to real GNP growth in 1988 and 1989, ``just the same boost
that military spending contributed in 1966 and 1967.''
   Business investment, continuing to show strength, is likely to
help buffer the landing. Brinner and Wyss believe this segment of
the economy might even be robust, based on optimistic plans and a
backlog of unfilled orders.
   Then there's housing. Much of the news in recent weeks has had a
negative tone, but that's because of a decline in housing
production. That's just one aspect of the picture. In contrast,
sales may pick up as mortgage rates fall.
   If they are correct, the economy could glide to a soft landing
instead of scraping and banging itself along the runway.
   But those soft landings may tend to be dragged out. Fewer people
may get hurt, but the pain may be prolonged. Less damage may be done
immediately, but perhaps more over the following months.
   On the other hand, it may be possible to survive a crash and
quickly get on with business so long as the fuselage isn't ruptured.
Quick and damaging might not be worse than long and painful.
   Clearly, the Federal Reserve has chosen to seek a soft landing,
but that doesn't mean it will get it. It doesn't have as precise an
instrument panel as it would like, and it could make some serious
errors.
   It will have to be even luckier or more skillful than in 1967,
say Brinner and Wyss. And who can forget the aftermath of that soft
landing?

   The question of whether big is better is
dominating the accounting industry, where the Big Eight flock of
firms threatens to dwindle to the even bigger Big Five.
   The mergers recently announced or currently being contemplated by
these huge firms are confounding some experts, who question not only
whether the combinations are necessary, but how clients ultimately
will fare.
   ``I just don't understand what they're after,'' said Abraham
Briloff, professor emeritus of accounting at Bernard M. Baruch
College in Manhattan. ``How big does bigness have to be?''
   The answer is pretty big. Chicago-based Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and
New York's Price Waterhouse confirmed this past week they had
entered into formal talks about merging their worldwide operations.
If completed the combination would be the world's largest accounting
firm with annual worldwide revenue of $5 billion and domestic
revenue of $2.7 billion.
   Together the two firms would audit almost 40 percent of the
companies in the Fortune 500.
   Experts in the hotly competitive field said they believed
Andersen and Price Waterhouse raced their announcement to the public
to steal some thunder from Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche Ross
&amp; Co.
   Deloitte and Touche Ross, which share the bottom rungs of the Big
Eight ladder, said they planned to join forces, creating the
third-largest accounting firm.
   The merger wave within the admittedly staid industry began weeks
ago when Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young &amp; Co. said they were
teaming up, in a merger that will create the world's biggest firm.
But the glory of being No. 1 may be fleeting, as Ernst &amp; Young would
be eclipsed by an Andersen-Waterhouse combination.
   The firms say they are being driven by the increasing
globalization of world economies, accelerating technological changes
and demand for new services and investments.
   Arthur Bowman, Atlanta-based publisher of Bowman's Accounting
Report, said 1992, the year Europe will meld into one economic
market, is spurring firms to position themselves to better win and
serve foreign clients.
   In addition, the firms are seeking to blanket the United States
with a cadre of highly qualified personnel, a commodity sometimes
difficult to come by.
   But Briloff argued that the firms can serve clients effectively
without merging. ``Within each organization, they have enough
personnel scattered around the globe to take care of the largest
multinational corporations, and if they don't, they can just go out
and hire.''
   Large corporations won't suffer from the mergers, but
middle-market companies _ those with sales under $100 million or so
_ could find themselves shunted aside, experts say.
   In recent years, highly specialized consulting services have
become a greater source of revenue for the Big Eight. In 1984, for
example, the firms collectively drew $935.5 million in revenue from
consulting services; last year that figure jumped to $2.1 billion,
according to Bowman.
   While each Big Eight firm serves small businesses, experts say
service to those companies sometimes is uneven.
   ``Are the major firms going to want to be price competitive for
emerging companies, or will they wait till these companies need a
basket of services that they can more efficiently produce?'' said
Gary Previts, professor of accountancy at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.
   Not all businesses need a large organization. ``Many corporations
prefer firms that are ... still small enough to provide personal
service,'' said Stuart Kessler, senior tax partner at Goldstein
Golub Kessler &amp; Co. in Manhattan.
   ``The CPA traditionally has been the consultant that does the
handholding, and I don't know how you do handholding when you've got
thousands of offices,'' he said.
   Indeed, Bowman contends that local accounting firms might find it
easier to win small business clients, because the ``the big firms
are going to get so large they can't handle them.''
   While the consolidations are likely to result in the layoff of
support staff and some professionals, fees charged to clients are
expected to remain unaffected.
   ``There won't be any efficiencies in the audit and tax returns by
becoming larger,'' Kessler said.
   Concern also swirls in the academic community, where professors
fear their students will have fewer job offers from which to choose.
But Kessler says that could be a boon for second-tier accounting

<HEAD>It's a Time of Year When Farmers Keep Fingers Crossed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a time of year when farming can be more
frustrating than usual, when the weather gods and market forces seem
to conspire for good or evil.
   Seeds have been planted, plans have been made or at least
tentatively drawn up. Now, if only the right combination of sun and
rain comes along. If only consumer appetites hold just right for
beef, or pork, or poultry.
   Except for winter wheat, which already has shown its
drought-tattered profile, the production of most other 1989 crops is
still to be determined.
   In just a month, however, when USDA issues its monthly crop
production report on Aug. 10, the pattern for corn, soybeans and
other major crops will be pretty well established.
   From then on, although there will be further revisions through
the fall months, farmers, private analysts, foreign buyers and USDA
economists will have a fairly accurate picture of U.S. agricultural
supply and demand for 1989-90.
   Meanwhile, there are and will be hundreds of forecasts,
projections, educated guesses, computerized profiles and assorted
dart-board analyses of how the U.S. agricultural economy is shaping
up for the year ahead.
   The USDA, in the words of economist Don Seaborg, says that
``cautious optimism marks the outlook'' for farmers and consumers.
   ``Unless the weather turns dry or becomes too wet over an
extended area of the country later on this summer, there will be
large harvests of food crops,'' Seaborg says. ``Along with plentiful
meat production, the outlook points to continued abundant supplies
of food.''
   A team of USDA economists _ Ken Nelson, Fred White, Kevin Bost,
Lee Christensen, Larry Witucki, Sara Short and Jim Miller _ said in
a report in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine that
timely rains have improved crop prospects and that forage and feed
costs are falling.
   ``A surge in fed cattle supplies has weakened cattle prices,
which will remain under downward pressure through early summer,''
the report said. ``Hog producers' losses since last fall have sapped
their financial strength. So hog production decisions will depend
critically upon what happens to feed prices this summer.''
   A large number of cattle in the marketing pipeline caused the
slaughter market to decline since late March, prompting feedlots to
sell cattle earlier and at lighter weights, the report said. For
example, average slaughter weights declined by 10 pounds per head
for steers and 12 pounds for heifers from March to May.
   Dry weather, poor pasture conditions and low stocks of hay in
early spring forced more cattle into feedlots.
   Although market prices of slaughter cattle dropped less than $1
per 100 pounds in May to about $74.50 per hundredweight, analysts
said prices may average in the range of $69 to $72 through early
summer.
   ``Retail Choice (grade) beef prices reached record levels in May
but are expected to decline into summer, partly because of the
increased production and already lower cattle prices,'' the report
said.
   Hog farmers' plans also will depend greatly on what happens to
corn and soybean crops this summer.
   Breeding herds were scaled back last summer as rising feed costs
cut into hog producers' returns, although analysts said the cutback
was modest by historical standards when cost-price squeezes
developed.
   ``One factor that may have buffered herd liquidation is that hog
producers entered last year's drought in a relatively strong
financial position,'' the report said. ``Net returns both in 1986
and 1987 were the highest in recent history.''
   If normal crop conditions prevail and feed costs decline, net
returns to hog producers will improve. As that happens, inventories
of breeding hogs should stabilize by the end of the year.
   Some other observations:
   _Broiler producers continue to be encouraged by good prices. Net
returns averaged 9 cents per pound in the first quarter, compared
with 6 cents in the fourth quarter of 1988. Production is expected
to increase about 5 percent this year to another record level.
   _Turkey production is expected to increase about 3 percent this
year. Wholesale prices may average in the range of 70 to 73 cents
per pound, up about 17 percent from 1988.
   _Production of table eggs is expected to drop about 4 percent in
1989, reflecting cutbacks in the laying flock because of last year's
low profit margins. Net returns to producers were about 11 cents per
dozen in the first quarter and are expected to ``remain positive''
for the remainder of this year.
   _Demand for dairy products has shown unusual strength for this
time of year, with prices rising during the heavy supply period of
spring. Much of that was due to the demand for non-fat dry milk.
International prices of powdered milk is expected to remain strong
in the second half of 1989, meaning that domestic prices probably
will continue up. Cheese prices also can be expected to rise.

<HEAD>Judge in Time-Paramount Fight: Highly Regarded But Hard to Predict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Time Inc. and Paramount Communications Inc.
bring their takeover battle before Chancellor William T. Allen on
Tuesday, they will face a jurist who is highly regarded by legal
scholars _ including some who disagree with him.
   ``He's really an extraordinary judge,'' said James D. Cox, a
professor at Duke University Law School. ``He brings the acuity of
years of practice as well as a very outstanding academic bent _
which is something characteristic of the very best judges in
American jurisprudence.''
   However, Cox said, ``I find myself wincing more often than not
with the results he's reached.''
   Melvin A. Eisenberg, a professor at the University of California
at Berkeley Law School, said of Allen, ``I disagree with a lot of
his results, but he's a very intelligent judge who has a very
lively, active mind.''
   Such praise takes on even greater significance when considered in
light of the role Allen's court plays in shaping U.S. corporate law.
Because nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in
Delaware, a decision in one case can have broad ramifications for
other companies.
   Allen, who heads Delaware's Chancery Court in Wilmington, on
Tuesday is to hear arguments on what could be the pivotal issue in
the struggle for Time. Paramount, which has bid $12.2 billion for
Time, contends the Time board put the company up for sale in March
when it agreed to a friendly merger with Warner Communications Inc.
   Under the laws of Delaware _ where all three companies are
incorporated _ if a company has put itself on the block, its board
must consider whatever bids will give stockholders the maximum value
for their shares. If Allen agrees with Paramount, it would be
difficult for the Time board to reject the $200 a share offer.
   Observers say it is hard to predict how Allen might rule.
   ``I don't think you can pigeonhole him,'' said Eisenberg.
   Michael Bradley, a University of Michigan law professor, said
Allen takes a ``middle of the ground, conservative approach to
takeovers.''
   Bernard Black, a professor at the Columbia University School of
Law, called Allen ``moderately pro-shareholder in the sense that
he's shown some willingness at the end of the day to say,
`ultimately the shareholders have the right to decide what they want
to do.'''
   However, Black said, ``I would emphasize the words `moderately'
and `some.'''
   Allen's past rulings give few clues as to how he might decide
this case.
   In March, Allen said the board of TW Services Inc., which was
fighting a hostile bid from the investor group Coniston Partners,
was not required to submit the unwanted offer to stockholders.
   The judge acknowledged that ``corporate democracy is a pertinent
concept,'' but he added, ``Directors, not shareholders, have
responsibilities to manage the business and affairs of the
corporation, subject however to a fiduciary obligation.''
   Allen made the statement in a decision upholding TW's ``poison
pill'' takeover defense. But in another case last year, he struck
down Interco Inc.'s poison pill, saying the company's board had
tried to use the defense to prevent shareholders from deciding
between the company's recapitalization plan and a hostile bid from
investors Steven and Mitchell Rales.
   Allen declined requests for an interview. But he has acknowledged
the significance of the Time-Paramount hearing.
   Late last month, he refused to hold hearings on Paramount's
request to block Time's annual meeting. The judge said it was more
important to spend his time preparing for Tuesday's session.
   Cox, the Duke professor, said Allen is aware of Delaware's
influential role in U.S. corporate law.
   Delaware court decisions have determined the outcome of many big
takeover battles in recent years, including Grand Metropolitan PLC's
successful pursuit of Pillsbury Co. last year and Shamrock Holdings
Inc.'s failed hostile bid for Polaroid Corp. earlier this year.
   But these decisions affect more than just the parties involved in
a particular takeover fight. They serve as precedents that can
affect future confrontations, and companies contemplating their
strategies are mindful of past decisions.
   Allen's decision in Time _ which undoubtedly will be appealed by
the losing side _ could affect friendly mergers planned by other
companies.
   Allen, 44, a graduate of New York University and the University
of Texas Law School in Austin, practiced for 11 years with a
Wilmington firm before joining the Chancery Court.
   He is an active participant in hearings, questioning attorneys as
they make their arguments and exhibiting a dry sense of humor. Like
other judges on the Chancery Court, he sometimes adds an air of
informality to his courtroom, presiding in a business suit rather
than a judge's trademark black robe.
   Allen joined the Chancery Court in 1985. The court, which has
five judges, has a crowded calendar and at times has had to recruit
retired judges to help with the caseload.
   Late last year, retired judge William Duffy was called back to
the bench to preside over suits involving one of 1988's megadeals,
Grand Metropolitan's buyout of Pillsbury. Duffy's ruling
invalidating Pillsbury's poison pill was seen as a key factor in
getting the company eventually to end months of resistance and agree
to a $5.68 billion buyout.

<HEAD>Wall Street Betting Heavily on Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   However else they may diverge, nearly all Wall
Street forecasts share one common viewpoint right now: Interest
rates are down and headed still lower in the weeks ahead.
   All the signs point, analysts agree, to further moves soon by the
Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   After a year of tightening credit from the beginning of 1988
through early this year in a campaign against inflation, the Fed
lately has signaled its evident switch to a more stimulative
approach, in an effort to cushion the impact of a slowing economy.
   ``We expect a move toward lower short-term interest rates,'' said
Erich Heinemann, economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. ``The Fed
should follow by cutting the discount rate before Labor Day.''
   In the unlikely event that Fed policy stays tight, many observers
contend, traders in the bond and short-term money markets would
probably do some de facto credit-easing on their own.
   The longer the Fed waits to loosen the reins, the reasoning goes,
the more talk will spread of a possible recession. That would
encourage investors to buy securities like Treasury bonds in
expectations that rates would fall on the basis of slackening demand
for credit.
   As investors have learned to expect over the past decade or two,
falling rates can be a powerful plus for stock prices.
   They tend to work, with a lag, as a stimulus to business activity
and corporate profits. At the same time, they diminish the future
appeal of interest-bearing securities _ the main alternative to
stocks that is available to money managers at investing institutions.
   But as they study the current situation, some stock-market
analysts confess to a few worries.
   First of all, experienced market-watchers naturally grow
suspicious any time some purported positive for stocks becomes
universally accepted dogma.
   By the time everybody agrees on an issue like this, stock prices
often have already taken the prospective news into account. Besides,
the market has a demonstrated penchant for proving the majority
wrong.
   Secondly, falling rates might not be so helpful to the stock
market if they evolve into a symptom of serious weakness in the
economy.
   Investors put such misgivings aside in the past week. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials rose 47.80 points to 2,487.86,
rebounding from a 91.81-point slide in the last week of June that
stood as its worst weekly showing in more than 15 months.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 3.66 to
181.56; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
climbed 7.13 to 442.42, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 4.78 at 363.75.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 126.86 million shares a day,
down from 162.15 million the week before.
   Whether the economy has a ``soft'' or ``hard'' landing, the stock
market could ultimately benefit, argues Michael Sherman at Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``Obviously, the outlook for bonds and interest-sensitive and
recession-resistant stocks could be very good if interest rates
tumbled,'' he said.
   ``More important, however, the entire equity market, while not
immune to the disappointment of declining profits and financial
problems, would ultimately respond vigorously to the further sharp
fall in interest rates that would attend a hard landing.''
   The worst economic development for stocks, Sherman maintains,
would be no ``landing'' at all _ but persistent strength in the
economy, accompanied by renewed upward pressure on inflation and
interest rates.
   Sherman rates such a script as no more than a 10 percent
probability. But if things should work out that way, he says, the
markets would be faced with trouble.
   ``This is the real bear scenario,'' he concludes. ``If it comes
true, bond prices would decline sharply and equities would do the
same as the Fed reverses policy and resumes tightening.''
