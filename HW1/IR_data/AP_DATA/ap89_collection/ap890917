<TEXT>
   Outside of East Berlin, the
country's showcase capital, East Germans live in dreary and decaying
cities where nagging shortages and chronic pollution aggravate a
rigidly regulated life.
   ``Everywhere you look outside the city centers, where most
foreigners go, the country is disintegrating. It's crumbling before
your eyes,'' said Helmut Lange, a Leipzig student who recently
joined an exodus to the West.
   Although East Germany's standard of living is the envy of its
Eastern European neighbors, thousands are embarrassing the Communist
leadership by fleeing shortly before next month's 40th anniversary
celebrations.
   Many of them come from the provincial cities where life is the
toughest, and the harsh crackdown on diseen 100 years this month
since a jury sentenced eight Hatfield clan members to life in prison
and ordered a ninth hanged for the slaying of five McCoys, ending
the bloodshed in which 10 to 20 people died.
   But most participants died of old age. The Hatfields' patriarch,
William Anderson ``Devil Anse'' Hatfield, got religion and gained
community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83. His grave
at Sarah Ann in Logan County is marked by a towering Italian marble
sculpture of him. The leader of the McCoys, Randolph ``Old Ran'l''
McCoy, embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children, moved to
town in Pikeville, Ky., dying in 1910 at age 85.
   Buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the
heart of Appalachia.
   What is known is that the Hatfields, living mainly in what is now
Mingo County, W.Va., and the McCoys, in Pike County, Ky., fought on
and off for a dozen years in the region's wooded tangle of valleys
and ridges.
   Some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the
McCoys and ended up in a Hatfield pen. Others say the dispute
stemmed from the Civil War, in which, this version goes, the
Hatfields fought for the Confederacy and the McCoys the Union.
Others say both families fought for the South.
   Romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between
Johnse Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy, and that she eventually bore him
a child out of wedlock.
   In a 1988 book ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
Appalachia, 1860-1900,'' author Altina Waller contends the feud was
the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on
subsistence farming, represented by the McCoys, and the emergence of
capitalism fueled by coal mining, timber cutting and railroad
interests in the Hatfields' region.
   Whatever the cause, open warfare between the families began in
1882 when Devil Anse's brother, Ellison Hatfield, was stabbed two
dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in Pike County.
The Hatfields seized the three McCoys responsible, and when Ellison
died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed.
   The feud escalated until New Year's Day 1888, when the Hatfields
attacked the McCoy home in Pike County, burning it to the ground and
killing two of Old Ran'l's children.
   The governors of Kentucky and West Virginia became involved in a
jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Now, McAllister's organization is trying to find a way to
commemorate the feud and the 1920 Matewan Massacre, a downtown
gunbattle between United Mine Workers sympathizers and coal company
guards in which at least nine people died. The incident was depicted
in the 1987 movie ``Matewan.''
   Robert McCoy, a former Matewan mayor, is among those who had to
grow up with the stigma attached to the feud, even though his branch
of the family had economic ties to Devil Anse and never took part in
the bloodshed.
   ``Not every McCoy or every Hatfield participated in the
shootouts,'' McCoy said. ``We're directly related to the so-called
feudists, but we weren't participants in the violent part of it.''
   But McCoy also is on the Matewan Development Center's board of
directors, whose plans call for historic restoration downtown.
   ``As a member of the family, I probably get a little tired of it.
Through the years, ever since I was in high school, it has been
brought to my attention,'' he said.
   ``But as a community, I think it's one of our great hopes for
economic survival here.''

<TEXT>
   If Poland's historic transition to
democracy is to survive, the new government must quickly solve some
serious economic problems.
   Yet the dimensions and complexity of the crisis are so staggering
that even Solidarity's Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist
prime minister in the East bloc, says ``Society has no concept how
difficult it will be to reform this economy.''
   How bad is it? Consider:
   The value of the zloty currency continues to plummet as inflation
soars. At the end of June, 4,900 zloties bought a dollar. Last week,
it took 10,000.
   That means a man who receives $20 a month from an aunt in Chicago
gets more than a month's average wage, which was 122,000 zlotys in
July, up from 55,000 in January.
   As a result, workers by the score have walked away from their
state jobs, forcing shops to close, mail to go undelivered and
assembly lines to stall.
   This year's state budget envisioned a deficit equivalent to $989
million at the official exchange rate, but the government raised it
to $4.9 billion in just seven months, said economics Professor Jozef
Kaleta in the Express Wieczorny newspaper.
   To span he gap, the government issues more money. Nearly 45
percent of the budget is being covered by the printing of banknotes,
according to a Communist Party report.
   The list of basics available only with difficulty this week in
Warsaw includes flour, cheese, sugar, razor blades, matches, washing
powder and sanitary napkins.
   The government survey of the ``mounting disequilibrium'' in the
non-food market listed as ``particularly painful'' shortages of
clothing, footwear, furniture, consumer electronics, appliances,
refrigerators, kitchenware, radios, sewing machines, bicycles, cars,
soap and shampoo.
   ``I have two children and I literally live in front of this store
for three weeks because my refrigerator broke down,'' said a woman
who, at 11:30 p.m., was in line outside a Warsaw shop where a
shipment of new appliances was expected some day. She and other
relatives took turns sleeping in a car.
   The hopelessly inadequate telephone system has less than 3
million telephones for 38 million people, no direct connections to
the United States and a tendency to cut off whole districts where
numbers start with a certain digit.
   Poland's $39 billion on foreign debt, $1,026 for every man, woman
and child, is the fourth largest in the world after Brazil, Mexico
and Argentina.
   Thirty percent of the government budget subsidizes goods and
services, according to a World Bank report.
   The cost of producing beef and veal is 50 percent subsidized,
according to the report. Such subsidies mean a farmer could find it
cheaper to buy milk at a store than drink it from his own cows.
   With the average price for coal covering only 53 percent of
production costs, supplies for the approaching winter are down
dramatically for lack of government subsidies, the state news agency
PAP warns. Other state industries can't pay for their coal.
   Outmoded, inefficient factories should be closed. But they employ
huge work forces, making up much of Solidarity's membership, and the
critical housing shortage makes it difficult for displaced workers
to move to new jobs.
   The wait for a minuscule Warsaw apartment is a decade or more,
but this year forecasters expect to complete 30,000 housing units
less than planned nationwide.
   Typical is a 20-year-old high rise apartment house on Dolna
Street in Warsaw which has not had hot water for seven of the past
11 months due to shoddy construction and lack of spare parts. Five
older neighboring buildings are not equipped for hot water at all.
   About 20 percent of university students emigrate, Gazeta Wyborcza
says.
   Doctors frequently prescribe medicines not available at
pharmacies, relying on patients to secure them in the West.
   Hospital stays require a supply of gifts to the staff to secure
everything from clean sheets to anesthetics.
   Physicians and nurses are among the most underpaid of Poles, a
remnant of the glorification of the laborer, and are allowed private
patients only after hours at government clinics.
   A dual currency system has developed, with the dollar used for
most meaningful transactions. Coffee, orange juice, Scotch,
televisions and apartments generally are available only for dollars.
   Most economic indicators are down, according to the most recent
government statistics: industrial sales by 5.9 percent,
manufacturing sales by 6 percent, June livestock procurement 25
percent below June 1988.
   Harder to quantify, but widely felt, is a decline in the pride of
craft as workers become demoralized.
   ``The present state of services, transportation, communications
and health care ... makes daily life extremely difficult, forces
people to break moral standards and accept humiliating treatment,''
wrote Stanislaw Chelstowski in Economic Life newspaper.
   The challenge is partly psychological, Mazowiecki says.
   ``The most difficult task is to make people feel that it can be
better, although it cannot be better immediately,'' he said.
   A 21-year-old teacher, learning of Mazowiecki's election,
commented: ``We're so tired, it doesn't really matter what happens.''
   On Aug. 1, the outgoing government took the first radical step,
lifting controls on almost all food prices. Although price increases
of several hundred percent followed, economists hope supplies will
improve.
   But a consensus is forming that even more painful and radical
reforms are needed.
   ``The economy is on its knees. The pauperization of society
advances almost from day to day so there is no time to look for some
miraculous cures,'' said Kaleta.

<HEAD>Storm Threatens California Grapes, Brings Rare Lightning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful storm pelted parts of northern
California on Saturday, causing power failures and a death by
lightning and threatening the nation's most valuable white wine
grape harvest.
   The storm knocked out electricity from King City, 100 miles south
of San Jose, to Chico, about 160 miles north of San Francisco, said
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. spokesman Ron Rutkowski.
   He said 200,000 residents lost power beginning at 5 a.m., mostly
because of lightning strikes, which are unusual in this part of the
West. Service was restored in most areas after a few hours,
Rutkowski said.
   Lightning struck and killed a man during a softball game in
Cotati, about 40 miles north of San Francisco, police said.
   A train that takes visitors on tours of the famed Napa Valley
wine country made its inaugural ride, despite being struck by
lightning and suffering a power failure before leaving the station.
   But growers in the area visited by the wine train said the rain
threatened to cause rot or late maturity for pricey chardonnay and
sauvignon blanc grapes that are nearly ready for harvest on 21,000
acres in Napa and Sonoma counties.
   ``It all depends on what happens in the next three of four
days,'' said grower Andrew Beckstoffer. ``We've got to get some wind
and heat to dry things up. But if we get humidity ... these grapes
will rot.''
   He said as much as three-quarters of the most expensive white
grapes in the country, worth $1,800 a ton or more, could be lost.
   The rains could allow ruinous mold to form on the grapes, or
dilute the grape sugar, delaying the maturation process and thereby
putting the grapes at greater risk of being reached by the rot,
saidJerry Luper, winemaster at Rutherford Hill winery.
   Enologists say the 1989 white grapes of Napa and Sonoma counties
have a potential to be a great vintage _ if the rain doesn't get to
them first.
   The red grapes, tougher and thicker-skinner than the whites, are
still on the vines and won't be harvested for weeks.

   Miss Missouri Debbye Turner, a
marimba-playing veterinary student, was crowned Miss America 1990 on
Saturday night.
   Miss Turner grabbed and hugged first runner-up Miss Maryland
Virginia Cha, 25, of Frederick, and gave a thumbs-up sign to the
audience before tearfully walking the runway.
   The other contestants swarmed around her as she finished her walk.
   ``It's exhilarating. I can only compare it to being in the
Olympics,'' said Miss Turner, 23, of Mexico, Mo.
   The second runner-up was Miss Colorado Debbie Riecks, 24, of
Aurora; the third runner-up was Miss Illinois Jeri Lynn Zimmermann,
21, of Chicago; and the fourth runner-up was Miss Ohio Kristin
Huffman, 24, of Canal Winchester.
   Miss Turner is the third black woman to become Miss America in
the pageant's 68-year history. She succeeds Miss America 1989
Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson, 23, of Anoka, Minn.
   Miss Turner said she felt no added pressure being a black Miss
America.
   ``I'm Debbye Turner. I grew up in Arkansas. I attend school in
Missouri. I'm a born-again Christian,'' she said. ``That's who I am.
Being black is not who I am.''
   She said she could only attribute her victory to the ``grace of
God,'' and now that she has won, her plans include eating pepperoni
pizza and sleeping.
   Miss Carlson placed the crown on Miss Turner's head before
sending her walking down the runway in the Atlantic City Convention
Center as host Gary Collins sang the pageant standard, ``There She
Is.''
   This year's contest became a platform for social issues for the
first time. Each finalist was asked a question about the issue of
her choice.
   Miss Turner was asked how to best motivate America's youth.
   ``You have to let them know they can do anything and then show
them the way to do that,'' she said.
   The 5-foot-7{, 118-pound contestant with dark brown hair and
brown eyes won one of the three preliminary swimsuit competitions,
in which she wore a canary yellow swimsuit.
   Miss Turner said her studies as a senior at the University of
Missouri-Columbia Veterinary Shool have given her the opportunity to
treat ``everything from a 4-day-old Vietnamese pot-bellied piglet to
a 2,000-pound Hereford bull.'' She said she collects ``surgery
souvenirs'' such as puppy fetuses.
   ``I just have a pure love for animals,'' said Miss Turner, who
turns 24 on Tuesday.
   Miss Turner wowed the crowd by playing the rapid-fire ``Flight of
the Bumblebee'' on the marimba. Wearing a two-piece red chiffon
pants suit with silver beading and a peplum waistline, she used four
mallets for part of the number before tossing two of them behind her
in an intense performance.
   For the evening gown competition, she wore a white velvet beaded
gown with a rhinestone bodice. The V-neck gown featured a keyhole
back.
   Each contestant was asked to write an essay before the pageant to
detail what she would like to advocate during her year as Miss
America.
   Miss Turner, a poised, self-assured woman, has said she wants to
use her reign to motivate young students to strive higher.
   ``I'm not naive,'' she said before the pageant. ``If I win Miss
America, I'm not saying I'm going to change every youth. If I've
inspired one person to be an astronaut, then I'd feel I made a
difference.''
   She deflects criticisms that the pageant offers a chance only to
white women.
   ``The doors weren't closed to me,'' she said. ``It's open for any
woman who is talented.''
   There have been two black Miss Americas. Miss America 1984
Vanessa Williams, however, was dethroned after a men's magazine
published nude photos of her cavorting with another woman. The first
runner-up that year, Suzette Charles, was also black, and she
completed Miss Williams' reign.
   Black women were not allowed to enter the pageant for the first
three decades of the contest. Blacks portrayed slaves in crowning
ceremonies during the early years of the pageant.
   Miss Turner's father, Frederick, is a retired Army career
officer. Her mother, Gussie, is a counselor, a missionary and an
evangelist. She has a 27-year-old sister, Suzette.
   About 15 friends from Miss Turner's veterinary class at the
University of Missouri in Columbia attended a party to watch the
contest.
   ``Debbye has the morals, she has the talent and she's a
professional,'' said Linda Patton, a third-year veterinary student.
``It was exciting. It was a thrill just knowing she was there.''
   Ten finalists were announced early in the televised program. In
addition to the runners-up, the finalists were Miss Florida Sandra
Frick, 23, of Hialeah; Miss Oklahoma Tamara Denise Toshiko Marler,
26, of Tulsa; Miss Pennsylvania Michelle Kline, 24, of Easton; Miss
Texas Leah Kay Lyle, 22, of Plainview; and Miss Washington Jennifer
Wall, 20, of Issaquah.
   The 10 finalists had the highest scores after three days of
preliminary swimsuit, talent and evening gown competitions and
interviews with judges.
   All of this year's contestants were asked by pageant officials to
take a stand on the issue of their choice, and the winner will be
urged to promote her platform during her reign.
   Pageant director Leonard Horn said the idea of giving Miss
America a voice is one that might bring her more national respect.
He has stressed in the past several months that ``this is not just a
beauty pageant.''
   For the first time, the contestants this year had to submit an
essay on the an issue they planned to promote during their year's
reign.
   Some of the issues chosen among the 10 finalists included human
organ donation, volunteerism, better education for minority
students, accessibility for the disabled and discrimination.
   The festivities were marred Friday night when Miss Marler was
struck in the head with a beer bottle during the Miss America Parade
and suffered a concussion. She spent the night under observation at
a city hospital and returned to rehearsal Saturday morning.

   The 68-year-old Miss America Pageant awards more than $5 million
in scholarships annually to more than 80,000 young women who compete
on the national, state and local levels.
   The new Miss America receives $42,500 in scholarships and the
next three runners-up receive $20,000, $14,000 and $11,000,
respectively.
   The remaining finalists each receive $6,000 to be used toward
their educations, and every remaining contestant receives a $2,500
scholarship.
   Collins was joined by his co-host, Miss America 1971 Phyllis
George Brown, for this year's show, an NBC-TV production with the
theme ``A Moment in Time.''
   The 51 contestants were interviewed and judged during the week by
a preliminary panel of seven judges. On Saturday, a panel of seven
celebrity judges started with a clean slate evaluating the 10
finalists.
   The scoring has been revised this year so that the interview with
the preliminary judges is counted in the final point tally Saturday
night. In the final scoring, talent counts for 40 percent, the
interview for 30 percent, and the evening gown and swimsuit
divisions each count for 15 percent.
   The celebrity judges were: developer Donald Trump, entertainer
and casino owner Merv Griffin, actresses Debbie Allen and Phylicia
Rashad, former Philadelphia Phillies third baseman Mike Schmidt,
psychologist and columnist Joyce Brothers, and gossip columnist
Claudia Cohen.

   Hurricane Hugo ripped away rooftops
and uprooted trees in Guadeloupe and Dominica early Sunday and
approached other popular resort islands of the eastern Caribbean
with deadly winds of up to 140 mph.
   Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' and said it
could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since
Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people
in the Caribbean and Florida.
   ``The eye of the hurricane is directly above Guadeloupe,'' Israel
Matos, director of the National Weather Service bureau in San Juan,
said Sunday at 1:25 a.m. EDT. It was impossible to telephone to
Guadeloupe early Sunday morning as telephone circuits were either
jammed or busy.
   At midnight EDT Saturday, Hugo's center was near 16.3 north
latitude and 61.1 west longitude, about 350 miles east-southeast of
San Juan. After hitting the French island it was expected to move
north toward Puerto Rico, said forecaster Martin Nelson at the
National Hurricane Center near Miami.
   The hurricane was moving west-northwest at 12 mph, sending
showers and gusty winds to the eastern edge of the Caribbean and
threatening islands over a 600-mile arc stretching from St. Lucia to
Puerto Rico.
   The storm's effects would start to be felt in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico by Sunday morning, the National Weather Service in
San Juan said.
   By midnight there was a blackout in most of Guadeloupe as
authorities turned off electricity as a precautionary measure,
government radio RFO said. The island experienced very strong winds,
which blew the metal roofing off some homes on Guadeloupe's eastern
side late Saturday night.
   In Dominica to the south there were power outages on the island's
north side where strong winds uprooted trees, the radio said.
   Radio France Internationale from Paris, monitored in San Juan
shortly before midnight Saturday, said French authorities were
preparing to send emergency supplies and personnel to Guadeloupe.
   ``It's a very dangerous storm, extremely dangerous in fact,''
Nelson said.
   Forecasters said if the storm remains on its northwesterly course
it would pass over St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands about 6 p.m.
Sunday and continue on to the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico
early Monday. San Juan, the Puerto Rican capital with a population
of 1.1 million, is on the northeastern coast.
   Earlier, forecasters had said the hurricane was headed for Puerto
Rico's southern coast.
   The National Weather Service in Miami issued hurricane warnings
at 3 p.m. EDT for the U.S. Virgin Islands and for Puerto Rico, which
previously had been on a hurricane watch. The warnings were posted
from Martinique northward and westward through Puerto Rico,
including the British Virgin Islands and St. Martin and surrounding
islands.
   Tropical storm watches for the islands of Barbados and St.
Vincent were discontinued, and a warning for St. Lucia was changed
to a tropical storm watch.
   Forecasters said waves 10 feet above normal could be expected
near the eye of Hugo, and warned of heavy rain and flooding.
   In Guadeloupe and Dominica, the first two islands directly in
Hugo's path, civil defense officials prepared to evacuate people to
rescue shelters.
   Franklin McDonald, head of the Pan-Caribbean Disaster
Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, said several relief
teams from the United States already were headed to the region.
   State radio said a heavy downpour set off a landslide early
Saturday on Dominica's isolated southeast side, which faces the
Atlantic, partly blocking a road but causing no injuries. The Public
Works Department deployed earth-moving equipment at strategic points
across the island.
   Non-critically ill patients at Princess Margaret Hospital in the
capital of Roseau were sent home late Friday and early Saturday to
make room for possible hurricane victims.
   The government of Dominica urged its citizens via radio to take
emergency precautions, and said police were put on alert ``to deal
with any security problem which might arise.'' There was widespread
looting after Hurricane David battered the tiny island of 81,000
people.
   In Guadeloupe, which has a population of 340,000, heavy traffic
built up in Pointe-a-Pitre, the biggest city, late Friday as people
rushed supermarkets and hardware stores, stocking up on food,
bottled water and supplies such as flashlights, batteries, timber,
nails and tape.
   The government ordered all pedestrians and cars to be off the
streets by 6 p.m. in what amounted to a curfew. The directions were
broadcast on radio stations.
   Residents boarded up doors and windows of their homes and many on
the Atlantic side fled inland.
   At Le Meridien, a luxury, 271-room beachfront hotel in St.
Francois, a woman who answered the telephone said guests were being
moved from ground-floor rooms and those facing the ocean. But she
said none of the 100 guests had checked out.
   ``Many people are worried; nobody's hysterical,'' said the hotel
employee, who asked not to be identified by name.
   In Paris, Air France canceled all three of its flights scheduled
Saturday to Guadeloupe's sister island, Martinique, and British
Airways canceled its flight from London to Antigua, where the
airport was closed.
   Officials in Puerto Rico said up to 6,000 people might have to be
evacuated from flood-prone areas if Hugo passes near the densely
populated island of 3.3 million.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake shook the Caspian Sea
region of the Soviet Union and Iran before dawn Sunday, the third
relatively strong earthquake in the area since Tuesday, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   There was no word of casualties or damage from the quake centered
in Soviet Azerbaijan 250 miles northwest of Tehran, measuring 5.6 on
the Richter scale, said the agency monitored in Nicosia.
   An observatory in Hong Kong said the quake was centered in the
Caspian Sea about 120 miles northeast of the Azerbaijani capital and
port city of Baku and measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Tehran and other cities in
northern Iran were jolted by the earthquake registered by the Tehran
University Geophysics Center at 4:24 a.m. (8:54 p.m. EDT Saturday).
   IRNA reported Saturday that an earthquake registering 5.5 on the
Richter scale shook the region Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey
in Washington said that quake, also with an epicenter east of Baku,
registered 6.6.
   Another tremor registering 5.2 shook the area around Gorgan, 185
miles east of Tehran on Tuesday, IRNA said.
   Iran is shaken by hundreds of earthquakes a year, ranging from
2.4 to 5.5 on the Richter Scale. The last major earthquake,
registering 7.7, was in September 1978. It killed 25,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a measure of energy released by an
earthquake as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one whole
number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause serious damage
and one of 7 can cause widespread heavy damage.

   Mother Teresa developed chest pains again
Sunday, but doctors treating the Nobel laureate said her overall
condition was stable.
   A statement issued by Woodlands Nursing Home, the hospital where
she is recovering from a heart attack, said the 79-year-old Roman
Catholic nun was ``resting comfortably.''
   ``The mother is having some chest pains. But her temperature is
showing signs of settling down and her overall condition is
stable,'' the statement said.
   ``We have found one or two causes for the infection. We are
hopeful that now she will improve faster,'' said Dr. A.K. Bardhan,
refusing to elaborate.
   Bardhan said Mother Teresa was still using a temporary pacemaker
that was attached after she suffered a heart attack Sept. 8. ``But
her heart is still weak even though she is improving and responding
to treatment,'' he said.
   Mother Teresa first developed chest pains and high fever Thursday
just as doctors thought she was progressing well.
   The soft-spoken nun was admitted to the hospital Sept. 5 with an
irregular heartbeat, a blocked artery and high fever.
   Born in Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa gave up a comfortable life as a
convent teacher to live and work among the destitute and dying in
this eastern Indian city's squalid slums. She was awarded the 1979
Nobel Peace Prize for her work.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned rundown hostel donated by the city. The order, formally
recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and has 3,000 nuns
working in 87 countries.

<HEAD>Oil Tankers Collide And Burn in North Sea, Causing 5-Mile Slick</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES to CORRECT that officials unsure how collision occurred,
UPDATES with gallons spilled. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HULL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two oil tankers collided in the North Sea
off eastern England early Sunday, causing a fire aboard both vessels
and an oil slick five miles long, the coast guard said.
   Seventeen of 26 crew members were evacuated from the
Liberian-registered Phillips Oklahoma after it collided with the
Maltese-registered Fiona, anchored near the mouth of the Humber
River about 150 miles north of London, said spokesman David Clempson.
   The Fiona's bosun jumped overboard and was treated for shock
after he was rescued, but the rest of the ship's 30-member crew
remained aboard, Clempson said. No other injuries were reported.
   The collision caused about 340,000 gallons of crude oil to escape
from the Oklahoma, forming a slick about five miles long and a
quarter-mile wide before the leak was contained, said Clempson.
   ``Most of that will have probably been burnt up in the fire,'' he
said. ``The way it is heading it doesn't appear to be coming
ashore.''
   Clempson said aircraft were dispatched to spray chemicals to
disperse the oil.
   The fires were extinguished by mid-morning and both ships were
anchored off Spurn Head in the mouth of the Humber River, Clempson
said.
   The Phillips Oklahoma, laden with 56,000 tons of crude oil, and
the Fiona carrying 46,500 tons of refined oil collided at about 5
a.m. (midnight EDT Saturday), he said.
   ``I'm not going to be drawn on the question of who's
responsibility it was,'' he said, adding that the investigation
would be conducted by the Marine Accident Investigation branch of
the British Department of Transport.
   Clempson said it was not clear how the collision occurred, since
the Phillips Oklahoma, the moving ship, was damaged on the stern
while the Fiona was damaged on the bow.
   Humberside police said the Oklahoma was inward bound to discharge
its cargo.
   Sea King helicopters, a Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft, a Royal
Navy minesweeper and firefighting tugs took part in the rescue,
Clempson said.

<HEAD>Kidnap Victim Steven Stayner Dead At 24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERCED, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steven Stayner, who as a child was
kidnapped and held captive until he escaped seven years later, died
in a motorcycle accident, a coroner's spokesman said.
   Stayner, 24, was pronounced dead at Merced Community Medical
Center shortly after the 5:30 p.m. Saturday accident on Santa Fe
Highway between Merced and Atwater, said a Merced County coroner's
spokesman, who declined to give his name.
   The car that hit Stayner, who was riding a motorcycle without a
helmet, took off after the accident, said state police officer Alan
Maxfield. It was found in Merced after the driver apparently
switched to another car, Maxfield said.
   Stayner, the subject of an NBC miniseries in May, lived as the
son of his abductor, Kenneth Parnell, a convicted child molester.
   In 1972, at the age of 7, Stayner was kidnapped while walking
home from school in Merced. When Stayner was 14, Parnell kidnapped
another boy, 5-year-old Timmy White. A short time later, Stayner
escaped, taking Timmy with him and going to a police station in
Ukiah, about 150 miles north.
   Stayner recently talked candidly with reporters of his life with
Parnell, who he said alternately molested him and passed him off as
his son, calling him Dennis. The boy was led to believe his parents
didn't want him any more.
   Parnell was convicted of two counts of kidnapping and was
sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison in February 1982
after an 18-day trial in Hayward. He served five years at Soledad
State Prison, then was on parole for another two years.
   While no sex charges were filed against Parnell, Stayner
testified during trial that he had been sexually abused.
   In 1985, Stayner married Jody Edmondson in Atwater, where the two
were living with their two small children at the time of his death.
   Earlier this year, Stayner had a walk-on part as a Merced police
officer in the television series about his case, ``I Know My First
Name is Steven,'' which was broadcast in May on NBC.
   In April, he told an interviewer, ``My hope with the movie is
that some kid sees it and gets up the nerve to tell someone and try
to come home.''
   Parnell, 57, is believed to be living in the San Francisco East
Bay area.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo ripped across resort
islands of the eastern Caribbean on Sunday with winds up to 140 mph,
ripping away rooftops, uprooting trees and leaving an estimated
3,000 people homeless on the island of Guadeloupe.
   Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' as it
churned toward Puerto Rico and said it could be the most powerful
hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in 1979. That
storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the Caribbean and Florida.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near latitude 16.6 north
and longitude 62.7 west, about 250 miles east-southeast of San Juan,
said the National Weather Service in Miami.
   Hugo was moving west-northwest at 12 mph and was expected to hit
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Sunday night or early Monday,
the weather service said. Hurricane warnings were in effect for
islands throughout the region.
   ``All preparedness actions should be rushed to completion in the
warned areas,'' the weather service said in its 9 a.m. weather
bulletin.
   The storm slammed into the French island of Guadeloupe, about 350
miles east-southeast of Puerto Rico, just after midnight Sunday.
   Phone circuits to affected islands were either busy or jammed
early Sunday and it could not be immediately determined if the storm
caused any casualties on the island of 340,000 people.
   Jean-Claude Roure, a government official on Martinique, told
French radio there were no reports of deaths of serious injuries on
Guadeloupe but that it appeared about 3,000 people were left
homeless. Martinique is about 100 miles south of Guadeloupe.
   Roure reported heavy damage to buildings and said the airport
control tower in the city of Pointe-a-Pitre was ``partially
destroyed.''
   ``Since people can't move around and almost all communications
are cut, it is possible there's more information that has not been
passed along,'' he said.
   He said it appeared that La Desirade, an island of about 1,600
people 22 miles east of Guadeloupe, may have been the hardest hit so
far but that all communications with it were cut.
   The director of civil security at the French Interior Ministry in
Paris, Hubert Fournier, said emergency supplies and personnel were
being prepared to be sent to Guadeloupe as soon as it was known what
was needed.
   Rainfall of up to 10 inches was expected in the path of the
hurricane, producing flash floods and possible mud slides in hilly
regions, the National Weather Service said. It warned residents in
mountainous areas to move to safer locations.
   Storm surges up to eight feet above normal were expected in
coastal areas, forecasters said.
   In Dominica to the south of Guadeloupe, there were power outages
on the island's north side where strong winds uprooted trees,
France's RFO radio said.
   In Antigua, just north of Guadeloupe, heavy rain and very strong
winds also uprooting trees were reported. Authorities there turned
off power to the entire island of 100,000 people as a precautionary
measure shortly before midnight.
   The radio reported flooding in low-lying areas but provided no
details. It said dozens of people were moved to shelters. At the
plush St. James Club hotel, on the island's southeastern side,
guests were evacuated.
   In the British dependency of Montserrat, northwest of Guadeloupe
and directly in Hugo's path, Joe Dominique, editor at Radio
Antilles, said the storm blew down trees and ripped away galvanized
rooftops of several homes in the capital, Plymouth, early Sunday.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Ethnic strife appeared to be the cause of the shooting, which
began on a college campus when a fight broke out between student
nationalists seeking independence for the southern province of Sindh
and those of immigrant parents from India, police said.
   The gunmen later moved from the college campus to Hyderabad's
shopping district. Police said both sides appeared to responsible
for the shootings.
   Shopkeepers shuttered their businesses, and police and
paramilitary forces began patrolling the streets.
   Hundreds of people have died and thousands have been injured in
ethnic violence in Hyderabad and in the port city of Karachi, 66
miles south on the Arabian Sea.

<HEAD>The Political Education of a Young Kennedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growing up in America's most famous
political family did not prepare Patrick J. Kennedy for the ways of
the Rhode Island General Assembly.
   The political education of Sen. Edward Kennedy's younger son
began last year, when he challenged a 10-year incumbent in the
Democratic primary for a state House seat from northwest Providence.
It continued when he got to the Statehouse and learned what it
really takes to pass a bill.
   Kennedy, 22, was no ordinary freshman. Then a junior and now a
senior at Providence College, he spent $87,694, or $66 per vote _ a
record for a state legislative race _ for a job that pays $300 a
year. All but $5,904 of that was his own money.
   Then Kennedy hired a staff aide and opened an office in his
district. His predecessor, like most General Assembly members, had
operated alone, using space in his house and his funeral home.
   But despite his family's wealth and prominence, Kennedy soon
found his bills treated the same as everyone else's in a House
where, observers like the group Common Cause say, the speaker's word
is law.
   Several of Kennedy's major initiatives, including a bill to
require Rhode Island automobiles to adhere to California emissions
standards, never got out of the committee he sits on, Health,
Education and Welfare.
   ``I talked to most of the members of the committee and it was
clear to me that we had a majority to pass that,'' Kennedy said. ``I
was told to go speak to the leadership, and I went to speak to
(Majority Leader) Tom Lamb and he said, `Well, we have to look into
this more,' and it was tabled.
   ``And I asked around, `what did this mean?' and people said,
`Well, that's tantamount to letting a bill die quietly.' ''
   The committee's chairman, Democrat Frank J. Fiorenzano, said
Kennedy's family background should have prepared him for his
legislative losses.
   ``Maybe he's disappointed that things didn't move as fast as he
wanted them to, but he shouldn't have been taken aback,'' Fiorenzano
said. ``I've submitted some pieces of legislation every year since
I've been elected and they still haven't been passed.''
   Kennedy said his father's life in the U.S. Senate was nothing
like the routine of the Rhode Island Statehouse.
   ``My father ... has had to come to compromise, he's had to work
on things with other colleagues and he's had to agree and
disagree,'' Kennedy said. ``That's the way the legislative process
is supposed to work, and that can still work without it being (a
system) where the shots are called without any compromise or
agreement.''
   The Rev. H. Philip West Jr., director of the Rhode Island chapter
of Common Cause, a legislative watchdog group, agreed that power is
highly centralized in the state house. ``So much seems to happen
here by the decision from the speaker's office,'' he said.
   Kennedy said he plans to seek re-election despite his frustration
with the system, and already is busy deflecting attacks from
Republicans. The GOP did not run anyone against him last year but
since then has criticized Kennedy repeatedly for raising thousands
of dollars from out-of-state sources.
   `Where I receive my contributions has no bearing whatsoever on my
voting. I thought it was offensive that they implied that people in
this neighborhood had their votes for sale,'' he said. ``After a
certain point, the amount of money you spend in a local race is
ineffective because people have to meet you.''
   House leaders said Kennedy has been as effective as any freshman
legislator and could have a bright future if he remains in the House.
   Speaker Joseph DeAngelis said he never had asked for Kennedy's
vote on any particular bill, but, ``On those issues that were party
issues, he has always been a Democrat.''
   Fiorenzano praised Kennedy's devotion to the job.
   ``Everyone, when you first get up there, thinks they're going to
change the world,'' Fiorenzano said. ``Then you learn not everyone
shares your view and you have to work with other people to reach
compromises on your issues.''

<HEAD>Reconstruction-era Law Defines Military Role In Drug Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The idea of deploying America's military forces
on the nation's streets to battle the scourge of drugs may be fodder
for headlines and congressional demands, but Pentagon officials
point out there are strict legal limitations on such a thing.
   ``It just makes hair stand on end here,'' said one senior
Pentagon official. ``Our primary mission is to prepare for any
possible military threat _ not to be a national police force. ...
There's been a lot of very loose talk about expanding our role.''
   To counter assumptions that U.S. troops could be used to patrol
the streets and nab drug dealers, Pentagon officials point to a
little-known law that prevents active duty troops from acting as law
enforcement officers within the nation's borders.
   It is known as the Posse Comitatus Act and was passed by Congress
in 1878 as a post-Civil War reaction to the use of federal troops in
enforcing the Reconstruction Acts.
   Because it deals with the enforcement of domestic law, the law
does not affect U.S. forces overseas.
   David Super, a Defense Department spokesman, said that while it
may be enticing to think of the nation's military might as a machine
to be turned against drug king pins, the ramifications have to be
taken into account.
   ``It's really a rather profound idea when you think about it,''
he said. ``Posse Comitatus is a reflection on our free society.
There are a lot of countries where the military is used to police
the streets, but they aren't much fun to live in.''
   According to a common legal definition, the term ``posse
comitatus'' means the power of the county and refers to the
authority of the sheriff to call to his aid the male population
above the age of 15 to in capturing escaped felons and keeping the
peace.
   In effect, the law is interpreted to mean that military forces _
the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines and their respective reserves
_ may be used in a support role for the battle against drugs, such
as aiding in surveillance or interdiction efforts.
   But they are prevented from adopting the role of law enforcement
officials, tasks assigned to the local police or other officials,
such as from the Drug Enforcement Agency.
   For example, the military may provide boats to help interdict
drug traffickers, or radar surveillance to spot a drug-transporting
plane, but it is up to civilian law enforcement officials to seize
evidence, make arrests, and testify in court.
   The law does not affect a state's National Guard when units are
under the control of its governor, but the laws in each state vary,
said Robert Dunlap, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau.
   The National Guard Bureau is the Defense Department agency that
serves as a coordinating body for the Guard forces in the various
states.
   It is National Guard Bureau policy that its members ``not be
tasked'' with enforcing civil law, officials point out.
   ``It's important, because we just don't have the training _ we're
not trained to do police work,'' Dunlap said.
   Dunlap said Guard units have been involved in helping local
officials support drug interdiction efforts since 1977, and since
1983 has been involved on the federal level.
   In fact, the role of the Guard has been expanded in 21 states to
allow them to aid Customs officials in cargo inspections for illicit
drugs, Super said.
   ``Guardsmen are happy to be involved. ... Guardsmen are all
volunteers and part of the community they serve. But our proper role
is in support of civilian law enforcement officials,'' Dunlap said.
   Congress has been pressing the Pentagon to become more active on
the home front in the war against drugs, despite concerns among the
military brass about draining resources from their traditional
defense mission.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is slated to outlined an expanded
military role this week. The secretary's plan is not expected to
call for an enforcement role for the military, but rather emphasize
increased interdiction and radar surveillance methods, among other
things.

   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
Sunday that if Iraq does not relinquish Iranian territory it seized
in the last days of the Persian Gulf war, his country ``will make it
retreat by force.''
   It was the toughest statement made by an Iranian leader since a
cease-fire in the eight-year war took effect Aug. 20, 1988.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted Rafsanjani as telling commanders of Iran's
Revolutionary Guards: ``We have no territorial ambitions, but we
will not cede one inch of our Islamic land.''
   Rafsanjani did not give Iraq a deadline but said, ``We will be
patient as far as possible.'' His comments to commanders of the
paramilitary Revolutionary Guards were carried by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency in a report monitored in Nicosia.
   ``It will be very easy for us to regain our land,'' said
Rafsanjani, who was elected July 28. He made clear Iran will not
make any concessions to break a deadlock in peace talks that began
more than a year ago.
   The Iranians insist there can be no advance in the talks until
the Iraqis withdraw from Iranian soil.
   Iran claims the Iraqis hold 1,028 square miles of Iranian border
territory. U.N. observers say the Iraqis hold 386 square miles.
   The land was captured in a series of Iraqi offensives shortly
before the cease-fire took effect.
   Those military setbacks were a key factor in forcing Tehran to
accept the U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   ``Iran is not seeking any illogical concession from Iraq, just as
it will not make any concessions to the enemy, even if the present
situation lasts 10 years,'' Rafsanjani said at the Revolutionary
Guards' commanders annual conference in Tehran.
   ``If one day we become certain that the enemy is not willing to
return our land, we will make it retreat by force,'' he declared.
   Rafsanjani said Iran has no desire to resume the war, which by
Western military estimates killed more than 1 million people. Iran
was believed to have suffered losses three times as heavy as Iraq.
   In addition to the land issue, the peace talks are stalled over
disagreements concerning the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the southern
boundary between the nations.
   Iraq is demanding that Iran allow the waterway _ Iraq's main
outlet to the Persian Gulf _ to be dredged and reopened. Iran
refuses.
   In addition, Iraq does not recognize a 1975 treaty that drew the
Iran-Iraq border down the center of the waterway. Before that
treaty, the border ran down the Iranian bank of the Shatt-al-Arab.
Iran says the 1975 treaty is valid.
   Rafsanjani said Iran will not back down on the Shatt-al-Arab.
   ``We will repel the enemy to the borders defined in the 1975
accord,'' he said.
   Before Rafsanjani spoke, Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, told commanders their forces and the regular army must be
in a state of constant combat readiness.
   But he noted: ``We are determined to achieve peace within the
framework of the U.N. Security Council resolution and we will never
initiate a step to weaken it.''
   The last session of peace talks was held in April under U.N.
auspices.

   The creator of the ``Solidarnosc'' banner
of the Polish trade union Solidarity is adopting another flag.
   Kazimierz Bascik, 47, is to take the oath of U.S. citizenship
Tuesday in a ceremony at the Statehouse in Columbus.
   Bascik created the Solidarity logo _ the word ``Solidarnosc'' in
red with the white-and-red Polish flag flying from it _ in 1980,
when the organization became the first legalized trade union in the
East bloc.
   The next year Bascik visited Columbus and Ohio State University,
but while he was on his way home, Poland's Communist government
imposed martial law. Bascik moved to West Germany, then returned to
Columbus. When his mother, Cecylia Bascik, was allowed to immigrate,
they settled in Clintonville, a suburb north of the city.
   Though he loves his homeland, Bascik said he is thrilled to
become a U.S. citizen. The day he takes the oath, Bascik said, ``I'm
going out to dinner and wave the American flag.''

   China's violent crackdown on demonstrators for
democracy is sharply cutting tourism and private investment and
contributing to troubles that will keep the Chinese from matching
last year's 11.2 percent economic growth rate, World Bank officials
say.
   China, the world's most populous country, will ``need to deal
with the economic consequences of political problems this (past)
summer,'' said the Bank's vice president for Asia, Attila
Karaosmanoglu.
   ``These problems include a sharp downturn in tourism and a
significant reduction in private investment,'' he told reporters at
a briefing on the Bank's annual report released Sunday.
   China is enjoying a strong year in agriculture, ``which will
reduce the need for food imports,'' but the growth rate can be
expected to decline as Chinese leaders pursue measures to cool the
economy and reduce inflation, Karaosmanoglu said.
   He declined to guess how far it would drop under 11.2 percent.
   For China, ``the most difficult part of the reform process lies
ahead,'' said the annual report. ``The stunning economic results of
promoting private enterprise in agriculture and decentralizing
decision-making in urban enterprises have brought with them more
fundamental problems. ...
   ``While the rising tempo of economic activity has raised the
living standards of the broad mass of population and served to keep
alive grassroots support for China's reform program,'' it said,
``such high rates of growth have clearly pushed the economy to the
limits of its productive capacity.''
   The World Bank reduced its anticipated fiscal 1989 lending to
China by $780 million, to $1.3 billion, Karaosmanoglu said, because
action by its board on seven projects ``was postponed last June
following the events in Beijing.''
   Postponement was ordered in consultation with Chinese
authorities, he said, adding that ``we hope we can return to China
in the near future. ... We fully intend to keep the door open.''
   But he said there is no timetable for reviving the postponed
projects.
   World Bank programs in China include development efforts in
remote, deprived areas where, the report noted, ``an estimated 70
million people live in conditions of absolute poverty.''

<HEAD>Rebuilt Babylon to Harken Back to Fabled Past</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BABYLON, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Songs written 6,000 years ago and deciphered
from stone tablets will waft through this fabled city on Friday as
Babylon relives the ancient days when it was the center of
civilization.
   Tens of thousands of people are expected at the huge cultural
extravaganza planned in Babylon, which is about 55 miles south of
Baghdad.
   The city was rebuilt by President Saddam Hussein at a cost of
about $100 million in an ambitious program to revive the splendors
of the past and to build a tourist industry folowing the eight-year
Persian Gulf war.
   For two weeks, Babylon's reconstructed palaces and temples will
echo with music, opera, dance and drama performed by troupes from
the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and 35 other countries.
   The focuses of the festival will be the 2,500-seat Greek
amphitheater, built in the 4th Century B.C. by Alexander the Great,
who died in Babylon; and the crown hall in the Palace of
Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled in the 6th century B.C.
   ``Babylon was the center of the world's civilization, arts and
culture and it is right that it regain that fame again,'' said Munir
Bashir, chief director of the festival.
   The first festival was held here in 1987, when Iran and Iraq were
at war. Last year's festival was held just a month after the
hostilities ceased under a U.N.-brokered truce.
   An estimated 100,000 people flocked to Babylon for last year's
festival, which featured artists from 24 countries, including
Brazilian guitarist Maria Liva Sao Marcos, the American Jeff Gardner
Jazz Quartet, the Leningrad Ballet and the Glamos Folk Group from
Norway.
   Only a handful of Europeans and Americans attended. But the
Iraqis expect more this year.
   ``Now that the war's over, we expect many more people,'' Bashir
said.
   A highlight, he said, will be an Iraqi troupe's presentation of
songs, dance and music based on ancient Babylonian music.
   The ancient music was played primarily on harps, some of which
have been found in the ruins of the city on the banks of the
Euphrates River.
   Bashir and other Iraqi researchers spent months unraveling the
notations on stone tablets to reproduce the primitive tunes, which
will be performed in public for the first time in millenia.
   Bashir, 59, is director of music at the Ministry of Information
and Culture and is the world's most renowned virtuoso of the oud, an
Arabic stringed instrument that was the forebear of the lute.
   The Iraqis claim that the ancient land known as Mesopotamia, or
``land between the rivers'' _ the Euphrates and Tigris _ was the
``cradle of civilization.'' It is also the reputed site of the
Garden of Eden.
   The Babylonians ruled an empire that flourished as a cultural,
religious and commercial center for hundreds of years. The legal and
social codes they developed were the first to provide for individual
and family rights and have influenced modern legal systems.
   Thousands of Iraqi, Sudanese and Egyptian laborers have toiled in
the blistering heat for the last few years to rebuild the
54,000-square foot Palace of Nebuchadnezzar, the Temples of
Nabashkhari and Ninmakh, the Processional Way, Babylon's main
thoroughfare, and the Ishtar Gate, named after the Babylonians' main
goddess.
   Officials said an estimated 15 million bricks, baked as they were
in ancient times, were used to restore the city's monuments based on
archaeological evidence, cuneiform texts and the description of
historians of the day.
   In other attractions at the festival, the Soviet Union will send
an Azerbaijani dance troupe, the Joyce Trisslet dance troupe is
coming from the United States.
   The amphitheater this year has been equipped with
state-of-the-art technology, including three-dimensional projectors,
to transform the performances at the ancient site into what one
official called ``a journey through time.''

   Now that the doors of the Soviet Union have
opened after 20 years of American knocking, the United States is
faced with the dilemma of handling an unprecedented surge of Soviet
emigres.
   Critics charge the administration's response, as presented this
week on Capitol Hill after seven months of deliberations, is
inadequate, unimaginative and risks missing a historic opportunity.
   Some say the U.S. government could learn a thing or two from
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's open door policy.
   The administration argues it is doing its best in the face of
shrinking budgets and the problem of dealing with 14 million
refugees worldwide, many of whom would like to move to the United
States.
   Of the 125,000 refugee slots allocated for fiscal 1990 _ that
starts Oct. 1 _ 50,000 will be reserved for Soviet applicants, most
of whom are Jews.
   The administration predicts as many as 150,000 Soviet Jews will
apply for refugee status in fiscal 1990. Jewish groups say as many
as 500,000 Jews may seek to come here in the coming years if the
doors remain open, especially in light of rising anti-Semitism in
the Soviet Union.
   An internal State Department report used by Immigration and
Naturalization officers in Moscow concluded that glasnost, with its
liberalized rights to free speech and press, has spawned
discrimination against Jews throughout the Soviet Union.
   Religious groups and many on Capitol Hill also argue that
Gorbachev's reforms and his political future are by no means assured
success, and their failure could strand thousands of persecuted
people wishing to leave.
   ``Soviet history has painfully demonstrated that lulls in
government repression are usually followed by harsh oppression,''
said a letter to Congress from World Relief, which represents
Evangelical Christians. The Evangelicals constitute a small
percentage of those seeking to come here.
   Members of Congress say if tight budgets are the problem keeping
more Soviets from coming to the United States, ``creative
financing'' should be considered.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, suggested the government help
additional refugees by lending them money for their relocation,
which would be paid back once they're settled.
   ``When the faucets start opening ... the United States finds
itself totally incapable of dealing with the very policy it is
demanding,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
   The administration agreed. ``The United States is to some degree
a victim of its own success,'' said Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger.
   But he argued that although the demand for liberalized Soviet
emigration was a cornerstone of U.S. policy for nearly 20 years,
``never was it said that the U.S. has an obligation to take them all
in.''
   He urged other countries, like Western European states, Australia
and Israel, to share the burden.
   Israel may be the only clear beneficiary of the surge of
emigration, which could go a long way to beefing up the Jewish
population and countering a growing Arab population domestically and
in neighboring states. Israeli officials said privately this week
that once Soviet Jews realize their entry to the United States was
sharply restricted, they might choose Israel.
   Most Jews and Evangelicals who have left so far have done so on
an Israeli visa. Once they get to Rome or Vienna, however, all but
10 percent or so shift direction for the United States.
   This has created a backlog in Rome and Vienna expected to reach
30,000 by Oct. 1. Some have been waiting for 18 months.
   Responding to growing pressure from Congress, the administration
promised this week its first priority would be to clear up the
backlog in Italy and Austria.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in an effort to head off
pending legislation that would automatically grant refugee status to
all Soviet applicants, announced he had ordered a review of 5,000
cases of Soviets in Rome who have been denied refugee status.
   Once the backlog is cleared, the Vienna and Rome centers, which
have cost the United States $34 million annually to maintain, will
be shut. All processing will be handled in Moscow, with a new
Washington facility to help.
   The administration is negotiating with the Soviets to be allowed
to increase its INS embassy staff from three to six officers
starting Oct. 1.
   Lawmakers this week ridiculed this solution, saying six
adjudicators would barely make a dent in the wave of applications
but noting that because the 1990 quota has already been used up by
the backlogs in Rome and Moscow, this would not matter much, anyway.

   The nation's new high-tech weather radar system
has passed its first test and is now headed for a detailed
evaluation, the National Weather Service announced Sunday.
   On a scale of 1-100, the new radar scored a 91 at detecting
severe storms in five months of tests at the Air Force Operational
Test and Evaluation Center in Norman, Okla.
   By comparison, the nation's current weather radar system averaged
only a 58 on the same types of tests, the Weather Service reports.
   NWS director Elbert W. Friday Jr., said he was pleased with the
results in the tests of NEXRAD, or Next Generation Weather Radar.
   However, he said more performance and reliability testing must be
done before the system can be installed across the country.
   NEXRAD will begin operational testing in the spring, with the
first system expected to become operational in July at Twin Lakes,
Okla., near Oklahoma City, according to Friday.
   By the mid-1990s the new system is expected to go into service at
165 locations across the nation. The system will be used by the
Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration, Air Force and Navy.
   In addition to improving the ability to forecast tornadoes,
thunderstorms, hailstorms and damaging winds the new radars also had
less than half as many false alarms as the current radar system.
   The new radars use what is called Doppler technology, which
allows the radar beam to detect not just the presence of rain and
moisture in the air, but also the speed and direction of winds.
   Radar sends out an electronic impulse, and when part of that
impulse bounces back the machine can determine the location of the
object causing the reflection.
   In the case of Doppler radar it can also determine the movement
of the reflecting item, such as a tornado or thunderstorm.
   In the tests the new radars were able to detect severe weather as
far as 250 miles from the site of the equipment, officials said.

<HEAD>Resort Area Slowly Sinks; Contractor Accepts Blame</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A six-block area of Waikiki Beach is sinking _
splitting sidewalks, tilting small buildings and making streets
uneven _ but a building contractor has taken responsibility.
   In order to excavate a block-sized area in the heart of the
tourist mecca to a depth of 30 feet as part of a $50 million
commercial project, Pacific Construction Co. has been pumping up to
7,000 gallons of groundwater out of the hole every minute since May.
   Officials of Pacific Construction accepted responsibility and
have had crews scrambling around to fill and patch the newest
pavement cracks or gaps between sidewalks or sagging walls and
buildings as soon as they are reported.
   Engineers and consultants who planned the project and city
officials who approved the plans assumed there would be some soil
settlement, said the city's chief building inspector, Sadao
Kaneshiro.
   The water table in the area is just 6 feet below the surface.
   ``Whenever you take out groundwater, the surrounding areas will
be affected,'' Kaneshiro said. ``They knew that, but it's a matter
of degree. They didn't know how much.''
   In some places, the subsidence has been as much as 4 inches.
   Pumping _ and, officials hope, the sinking _ will stop when
construction reaches the fourth-floor level in about six weeks, said
Trudie China, Pacific Construction's marketing manager.
   Managers of neighboring buildings are pleased with Pacific
Construction's response, but don't like the nuisance and think the
contractors and city should have anticipated the problem.
   ``After all, Waikiki is built on a swamp, and these guys are
draining the swamp,'' said John Van Apell, building manager of the
nearby Royal Kuhio condominium.
   Steve Winter, general manager of the Waikiki Joy Hotel, across
the street from the hole, said he is trying to take the problem in
stride and ``can't give enough credit to Pacific Construction for
trying to repair the damage.''
   Kimberly Line, administrator of the 13-story Laniolu Retirement
Home and Care Center, said ``it's not just the actual damage, it's
the mental anguish the residents go through. They ask me, `Are we
still safe? Is the building going to fall down?'''
   Willella Reub, a resident of Laniolu, said it's a question of
comfort. Her wheelchair ``rides hard'' over the bumps caused by the
subsidence, she said.

   An Immigration and Naturalization

   The bus, with 63 people on board, was en route from San Clemente

lost control, Border Patrol supervisory agent Michael Gregg said.
   The bus went onto a shoulder of the highway but remained upright,

   The aliens had been detained by INS agents at the San Clemente

   The bus was making a regular run to the Border Patrol's San

<TEXT>
   The Hungarian ambassador to the United States
on Sunday denied Western speculation that the Kremlin had given
prior approval to his government's decision to open its borders to
East Germans fleeing to the West.
   Ambassador Peter Varkonyi told a television interviewer that ``I
haven't got strict information on'' the decision, but that
``Hungarian decisions are made in Budapest,'' the Hungarian capital.
   ``Of course, there is a diplomatic way of consultation and
information, but the decision was taken in Budapest,'' Varkonyi said
on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Asked whether the decision had been made ``without reference to
the Soviet Union,'' the ambassador replied, ``Without any reference
to the Soviet Union at all.''
   The Washington Post, in an article from Oslo, Norway, published
in its Sunday editions, quoted unidentified Western officials saying
that Hungary consulted with the Kremlin before allowing the East
Germans to leave.
   And a former senior U.S. government official said she believed
the Kremlin had approved the Hungarian decision in advance.
   Rozanne L. Ridgway, a former ambassador to East Germany and
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, asked whether she
thought Moscow had given Hungary the green light, said: ``I do think
that is true.''
   The Hungarian ambassador to Washington said that although the
flight of an estimated 14,000 East Germans across Hungarian borders
to the West had drawn criticism from the East German leadership, his
government did not plan to close the frontier.
   ``To send them back against their will and without any provisions
that they would be immune to any punishment, and would have a legal
opportunity to emigrate, would have been not correct and we would
like to comply with our international obligations on human rights,''
he said.
   Multilateral agreements signed by Western and Soviet bloc nations
``explicitly say certain things about choice of emigration,'' and
nations that do sign but do not heed those pacts are in violation,
he said.
   ``If they are not ensuring a choice of emigration, it seems to be
that it isn't complying with the international agreements we have
signed,'' Varkonyi said.
   Two other guests on the ABC program, West German ambassador S.
Juergen Ruhfus and Theo Summer, editor of the newspaper Die Zeit of
Hamburg, predicted the East German government would be forced to
drop its resistance to the types of political and economic reform
underway in Hungary, Poland the Soviet Union.

   Singer K.T. Oslin, who has two
big-selling country albums, was named female vocalist of the year in
1988 and has numerous awards to her credit, once hated country music.
   ``I loathed it,'' she said. ``Country music, at that time, was
all middle-aged men, singing about drinking and cheating on their
ever-loyal wives.''
   Ms. Oslin, 46, says her music still isn't pure country, but says
it's more country than anything.
   ``I think there's an audience of people out there that don't
listen to country music at all that would like my stuff,'' she said.
``I'd like to find them.''
   Ms. Oslin, who performed in Dallas on Saturday night, began her
career on the Broadway stage in a 1967 production of ``Hello,
Dolly!'' but made her mark on the country charts with the anthem
``80s Ladies.''
   The Academy of Country Music named her female vocalist of the
year last year and she garnered a Grammy award this year for her
hit, ``Hold Me.''

   Exiled Greek King Constantine and his
Danish-born wife, Anne-Marie, had a royal celebration of their
silver wedding anniversary.
   The guest list of their weekend bash read like regal who's who:
King Juan Carlos of Spain, King Carl-Gustaf of Sweden, the Prince of
Wales and Queen Beatrix of Holland.
   In all, 300 relatives and friends gathered to celebrate the
pair's 25th wedding anniversary. The festivities started Saturday
with a gala dinner in the 16th century fortress of Kronborg, known
as Elsinore Castle in William Shakepeare's play Hamlet.
   Heavily armed police with dogs patrolled the grounds and the
rampart and frogmen searched the waters around the sand-stone
fortress.
   Also among the guests were Grand Duc Jean of Luxembourg and three
former titleholders: King Simeon of Bulgaria, King Michael of
Rumania and Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia.
   Constantine and Anne-Marie went into exile in 1967 after an
abortive countercoup against a military junta that overthrew Premier
Panayiotis Canellopoulos the same year.

   Vocalist Gail Nelson sang ``I Got Rhythm,'' and
she wasn't alone in being caught up with the beat as a sellout crowd
gathered to celebrate the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's official
return to Orchestra Hall.
   Nelson joined guest conductor Mitch Miller, dancer Gregory Hines,
two high school bands, clowns from the Detroit Fire Department and
other entertainers in the orchestra's homecoming show.
   Friday's event marked the symphony's permanent relocation in
Orchestra Hall after a half-century absence and an 18-year effort to
rescue the building from ruin.
   Orchestra Hall was built for the Detroit Symphony in 1919 for
about $1 million. But the orchestra fell on hard times during the
Depression and was evicted in 1939 after several years of missed
rent and tax payments.
   Paul Ganson, a Detroit Symphony bassoonist, helped found Save
Orchestra Hall in 1971 after hearing plans to destroy the building.
The organization bought the building and raised more than $10
million to finance repairs and restoration work.
   On Friday, Ganson proclaimed: ``Home at last! Home at last! Thank
God almighty, we're home at last!''

   Singer Don Henley, the former Eagles band member on
tour to drum up interest for his third solo album, says he has a
hard time relating to most of today's pop music.
   ``I don't know if it's because I'm getting older or what, but a
lot of this new music seems incredibly moronic to me,'' said the
42-year-old musician. ``On the other hand, rock 'n' roll isn't
supposed to be too cerebral.''
   Henley, who performed in Dallas on Saturday, said he relates only
to his own music and that of Tom Petty.
   ``If you look at the other stuff that's in the Top 10,'' he said,
``it's me and Paula Abdul and New Kids On the Block and Milli
Vanilli and Prince's `Batman.' It's pretty grim up there.''
   But Henley, who grew up in the East Texas town of Linden, doesn't
dwell too much in the past as far as his concert selections are
concerned.
   ``We do three Eagles songs in each set. That's about enough,'' he
said.

<HEAD>China Steps Up Rhetoric Against Foreign Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China stepped up its campaign against the Western
press Sunday, reprinting a 65-year-old commentary calling for the
expulsion of all foreign reporters.
   Also Sunday, Premier Li Peng told a Japanese delegation that the
government will not soon lift martial law in Beijing because
citizens seized many weapons from the army during the June crackdown
on pro-democracy protesters.
   The official Beijing Daily reprinted on its front page a 1924
essay by Li Dazhao, co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party,
saying China was the victim of ``journalistic invasion.''
   The article applauded the expulsion of a British reporter who
erroneously reported the death of Sun Yat-sen, the man regarded as
the father of modern China. Sun died in 1925.
   But Li Dazhao said expelling one reporter was not enough. ``The
Chinese government ... should expel all foreign reporters, who
spread rumors, make trouble and insult China,'' he said.
   The article was accompanied by another commentary saying the
article shows that foreign journalists have been spreading rumors in
China for decades.
   ``The `press freedoms' of imperialist countries haven't
progressed at all,'' it said.
   It said Li Dazhao's writings were reprinted to show that the
``rumor-mongering'' of Voice of America, the American
government-funded radio station, was not ``an accidental mistake.''
   Voice of America, regarded by its large Chinse audience as one of
the few independent sources of information available, has been
repeatedly attacked by the government for its reporting on the
democracy movement.
   China ordered seven reporters, including two from VOA, to leave
during the crisis in June which led to troops firing on
demonstrators, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands.
   A third commentary in Sunday's Economic Information criticized
leaders of the democracy movement for calling for freedom of the
press, saying they have an idealized view of Western freedoms.
   Official newspapers in May gave colorful, accurate coverage of
the pro-democracy protests, exhibiting a degree of journalistic
independence never before seen in China. But in the current
crackdown on dissent they have reverted to conveying the party line.
   Sunday's commentary claimed that press freedoms do not exist in
Western countries and that the American media are controlled by 50
powerful companies that ``not only hold the media organizations'
economic lifeblood but also directly intervene in (their) reporting
and editing policies.''
   It singled out political scientist Yan Jiaqi for ``beautifying
the press freedoms of Western countries'' and Shanghai's World
Economic Herald for ``showing unusual interest in political
questions.''
   Yan, an adviser to ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang, fled to the
West shortly after the June military attack. The Herald was
temporarily shut down and its editor, Qin Benli, was fired for
supporting the student-led movement.
   ``In socialist China ... to be a journalist of the party (means)
to be of one mind with the party,'' the article said.
   The commentaries Sunday follow a series of essays in recent weeks
on the role of journalism in China.
   Japanese sources said Premier Li told former Foreign Minister
Masayoshi Ito, who is heading a five-member parliamentary delegation
to China, that martial law must continue because hundreds of weapons
seized by citizens during the June 3-4 clash with the military have
yet to be retrieved.
   The premier, in his meeting with Japanese leaders, said life in
Beijing had returned to normal, but anti-government forces still
exist and the military was needed to assist police in maintaining
order, the Japanese sources reported.
   The sources said Ito urged Li to lift martial law soon. He also
said that although Japan did not want to interfere in China's
internal affairs, China should realize that the military suppression
of the protesters had hurt China's international image.

<HEAD>Capitol Hill Debate on Drug War Freezes Spending Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans may propose a new strategy Monday
to pay for the war on drugs as Congress continues its debate on
President Bush's plan to fight narcotics trafficking, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole said Sunday.
   With two weeks before the start of a new fiscal year, Congress is
scrambling to pass a dozen money bills needed to keep the government
running, but is stymied over how to wage and finance the war on
drugs.
   The money measures are stacked up in the Senate like planes over
a busy airport as negotiators try to work out the politically
charged drug issue, with both Democrats and Republicans angling to
show they care more than the other side about the narcotics scourge.
   ``We have fundamentally different objectives and goals,'' said
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. He said Democrats will be content only if the growth in
the number of cocaine addicts is reversed, drug treatment is
provided for all who want it and drug education is extended to
nearly every school child in the country.
   There are ``glaring deficiencies'' in Bush's plan, particularly
in those areas, Biden said. And signaling his party's intention to
make drugs a political battleground, he promised ``a much broader
Democratic strategy'' to be elucidated in the weeks and months ahead.
   Republicans claimed the issue as their top priority as well and
said Bush had fulfilled his mandate by proposing an ambitious and
comprehensive anti-drug package.
   Dole said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that ``I don't think
we find any problem in the president's package.''
   Bush himself said he remains flexible about how to pay for the
initiative, but added: ``I strongly believe that we must retain the
integrated elements of this drug strategy, which took more than six
months to develop.''
   The president proposed increasing spending by $1.5 billion over
what he had asked in his initial fiscal 1990 budget request, with
the heaviest emphasis on law enforcement and prosecution. He sought
to pay for the program by reducing spending on other domestic
programs.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
then upped the ante by proposing an additional $2.2 billion in
spending, to be paid for with an across-the-board spending cut of
about half a percent. Byrd's emphasis was on treatment and education.
   Senate negotiators for the two sides _ nine Democrats and nine
Republicans _ were to meet again late Monday to see whether
agreement could be reached on a drug-fighting plan and a way to pay
for it. But until such a package could be worked out, the spending
bills that will include any payment scheme were effectively frozen
in place.
   ``It'll be a critical meeting,'' Dole said. ``We may make a
counter offer at that time _ Republican.''
   Dole rejected Byrd's proposal and said ``we ought to look at more
than across-the-board cuts. We ought to look at ... other ways to
find the money.''
   As the Senate wrangled over drugs, the House Democratic
leadership was seeking to formulate an alternative to the capital
gains tax cut approved last week by the Ways and Means Committee.
   The tax-writing panel handed Bush a major victory on the issue,
but Democrats want to head it off on the House floor by offering an
alternative tax package that would be more philosophically in tune
with their theme of fighting for the middle class _ possibly
including a new tax break for individual retirement accounts.
   The House floor agenda for the week included consideration of a
$270 million bill to provide for increased security and weapons
detection systems at airports, and legislation that would regulate
shipping to prevent catastrophic accidents such as the Alaskan oil
spill and make those involved in oil transportation pay the full
costs of cleanup.

<HEAD>De Klerk Wins Praise, But The Honeymoon Likely to be Brief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect F.W. de Klerk
has won praise for allowing huge anti-apartheid marches, but
political analysts said Sunday the honeymoon will be brief unless he
quickly brings reforms.
   In a major policy shift, de Klerk said Tuesday that police will
not disrupt peaceful demonstrations, previously banned or forcefully
dispersed.
   A day later, 20,000 activists in Cape Town staged the country's
largest legal demonstration, followed by similar protests Friday in
Johannesburg and Pretoria.
   ``Nice going, F.W. _ but what's next?'' the Sunday Star of
Johannesburg asked in an editorial. ``A few protest marches do not
alter the fundamental (apartheid) system which governs our lives .
.. The window of opportunity (for reform) is open but it will not
remain so for long.''
   De Klerk, to be sworn into office Wednesday, says he wants to
give the 28-million voteless black majority a limited role within
five years in the national government, now dominated by leaders of
South Africa's 5 million whites.
   On Saturday, de Klerk named Gerrit Viljoen, the former minister
of black education, to spearhead government efforts to negotiate a
new constitution with blacks.
   Viljoen, who has a doctorate in literature, is a bookish,
soft-spoken, political moderate closely allied with de Klerk.
   Black leaders are skeptical of de Klerk's promises, and bringing
them to the negotiating table will not be easy. They refuse to have
talks with the government, saying it first must end the 3-year-old
state of emergency, release political prisoners such as Nelson
Mandela and legalize the guerrilla-backed African National Congress
and other banned organizations.
   Activists say they will analyze de Klerk's offer at a major Oct.
7 conference in Johannesburg on strategy to end South Africa's
apartheid system of legal race discrimination.
   ``We will have an opportunity ... to look at Mr. de Klerk's
promises and his ability to fulfill them,'' anti-apartheid leader
the Rev. Allan Boesak said Saturday.
   Meanwhile, activists will pursue a 6-week-old nationwide campaign
of defiance that has targeted segregated schools, hospitals,
beaches, buses and other facilities.
   A march through downtown Durban is scheduled Friday, and
additional beach protests are set for the end of September.
   De Klerk's calls for reform remain vague and likely will draw
fire from activists and conservatives when he begins to spell out
changes.
   ``He has done little more than commit himself to the political
equivalents of apple pie and mother's love _ negotiated solutions
and a peaceful, prosperous society,'' wrote Lester Venter, political
columnist for the Sunday Times, the country's largest paper. ``The
content of the man's political vision ... is not yet clear.''
   The extreme-right Conservative Party, which opposes all
concessions to blacks, has harshly attacked de Klerk for authorizing
the demonstrations.
   ``A knife has been thrust in the back of the upholders of law and
order,'' said Conservative spokesman Moolman Mentz.
   Several local newspapers reported de Klerk approved the protests
despite opposition from security officials, who seldom were
overruled by de Klerk's retiring predecessor, P.W. Botha.
   De Klerk calls for an end to discrimination, but insists he will
preserve segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites who want
them.
   He also has made clear he will not accept a one-man, one-vote
political system, or black majority rule.

<HEAD>Fight to Save ``Top Gun'' Tomcat Hinges on Fate of New Fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision earlier this year to
cancel the Navy's F-14D jet fighter that achieved fame in the movie
``Top Gun'' touched off a major campaign in Congress to save the
carrier aircraft.
   The lobbying paid off last month when the House approved a bill
that restored $1 billion for 24 planes over the next two years.
   The Senate, in its defense bill, had endorsed the president's
plan to kill the Tomcat fighter.
   As members of the House and Senate get down to fashioning a final
version of the defense bill during the coming week, congressional
backers of the F-14D are taking heart in the woes of another
aircraft _ the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   The two prototypes of the plane _ one for the Navy and one for
the Air Force _ will not share a common design, forcing the Defense
Department to pay for two separate fighter plane programs, according
to recent reports.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said at a hearing earlier this month that development of the
next-generation aircraft, which is intended to succeed the Air
Force's F-15 and the Navy's F-14D, has slipped six months.
   The problems prompted the House, in its appropriations bill, to
eliminate the $1.1 billion for the Air Force's fighter and $65
million for the Navy's version in the fiscal 1990 budget.
   ``The (House Appropriations) committee is not convinced ... that
the ATF program as currently structured will meet the requirement
with a mission and cost effective solution,'' the panel said in its
report accompanying the spending bill.
   Specifically, the committee complained that the Air Force
predicts the ATF will be built at a rate of 72 per year, yet it has
been unable ``to achieve such a sustained rate for the F-15 which by
any measure is a much cheaper aircraft.''
   The panel also noted that in the last six months, the cost of
research and development of the program has increased by $900
million, to $13.5 billion.
   With the Air Force planning to buy 750 advanced tactical fighters
at a total cost of about $64 billion and the Navy planning to
replace the F-14D with the ATF, the price could exceed the $70
billion for the B-2 stealth bomber program.
   That bat-winged aircraft is considered the most expensive in
history.
   Lawmakers indicated last week that although the problems of the
advanced tactical fighter have raised concerns on Capitol Hill, and
may help the F-14D campaign, the House-Senate conferees likely will
restore much of the money for the radar-evading fighter.
   The action by the House was the proverbial shot across the bow,
members said.
   ``It was a strong message to the administration and the Air
Force,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., a member of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on defense.
   Two groups are building prototypes of the plane. Northrop and
McDonnell Douglas are building the design known as YF-23 while
Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics are constructing YF-22. The
prototypes are scheduled to fly next year with the contract to be
awarded in January 1991.
   Ideally, the ATF will replace the F-14D, manufactured by Grumman
Corp., of New York, without a void in the Navy's line of carrier
fighters.
   ``We hope to sequence in the ATF and not have a gap,'' said Rep.
Joseph M. McDade of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the
Appropriations defense subcommittee.

   William Bennett's visit to Philadelphia this
week kicks off a new phase of the Bush administration's war on drugs
after an intense behind-the-scenes struggle by state politicians
seeking more federal money and a share of the spotlight.
   Pennsylvania lawmakers want the extra federal money that would
come with designation of the city as a ``high-intensity drug
trafficking area,'' but they also worry about the effect such a
declaration would have on the city's image.
   At the same time, the state's two Republican senators are
offering different advice to Bennett: Arlen Specter wants more
emphasis on crime prevention while John Heinz puts the focus on
punishment of offenders.
   To qualify for the extra money under the 1988 federal drug law,
an area must be a major drug distribution center that already has
committed itself to solving the problem.
   ``It's difficult for the city, which I think is making heroic
efforts to get not only drug abuse, but drug dealing, under
control,'' Heinz said. ``At the same time, we have to demonstrate to
Bill Bennett not only that the city is making a good effort, but
that the problems are growing and that they are potentially worse in
Philadelphia than in many other American cities.''
   Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
plans to visit Philadelphia on Monday, the New York City area
Tuesday and Cleveland on Wednesday.
   Details of his schedule were not immediately released for
security reasons. The announcement of the trip set off immediate
jockeying by Heinz, Specter and Philadelphia officials to define
Bennett's itinerary.
   Bennett is making the trip to promote the Bush administration's
$7.9 billion plan calling for a crackdown on all levels of drug
trafficking.
   Philadelphia lobbyists and city officials expressed concern that
efforts to dramatize the need for federal might create the
impression that the city has failed.
   But Specter said, ``I do not think it is any big secret that
Philadelphia has a major drug problem just like New York City and
Los Angeles and Miami and other cities. I think people would be
surprised if their elected officials did not do everything possible
to prevent it.''
   Heinz agreed on the seriousness of the problem.
   ``Reported drug crimes rose 74 percent in Philadelphia in 1988,
while the city's murder rate exceeded one per day for the first time
in eight years,'' he said in a letter to Bennett requesting the
Philadelphia visit.

   Five political veterans are leading eight others
in the primary race for mayor of Seattle, often touted as one of the
nation's most liveable cities but facing problems with crime,
desegregation and traffic.
   The large field without any clear front-runner contributed to a
largely ho-hum race for Tuesday's primary, said Deputy Mayor Charles
Stafford, an 18-year City Hall veteran.
   The top two finishers in the primary for the non-partisan office
meet in a runoff Nov. 7. There are no statewide candidates on the
ballot this year, but an unusual number of cities across Washington
state are selecting successors to outgoing mayors.
   Mayor Charles Royer is leaving after an unprecedented three
four-year terms to become director of the Institute of Politics at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
   Although there is no overwhelming favorite, City Councilman Norm
Rice, who is seeking to become Seattle's first black mayor, is
generally seen as the likely top vote-getter. Randy Revelle, a
former city councilman and county executive, and Doug Jewett, the
city attorney, are considered best bets for the No. 2 runoff spot.
Also given a shot are council members Dolores Sibonga and Jim Street.
   Judging partly by voter turnout in 1985, when Royer defeated Rice
by a more than 5-to-3 margin, Bob Bruce of the King County Records
and Elections Division has predicted about 28 percent of the city's
approximately 300,000 registered voters will cast ballots.
   In recent years Seattle consistently has been picked as one of
the country's best places to live, do business and raise children.
Its maritime environment, mountain views and booming economy rank
high in magazine surveys.
   ``I don't want to sound too self-serving, but it's kind of hard
to beat up on the government,'' said Royer, the incumbent. ``We've
done a good job. The city is in terrific financial shape.''
   However, at the same time burglary rates are skyrocketing, there
is debate over school desegregation, and traffic congestion rivals
that of Los Angeles.
   The leading mayoral candidates differ less on these issues than
on terms of experience, leadership and style.
   ``I think it is very difficult to define any big differences in
terms of the issues,'' said Rice.
   ``There is a strong overlap among all of us in terms of a
progressive, liberal approach to social services, housing and these
sorts of issues,'' said Street.
   Jewett is the only major candidate who supports an initiative to
end mandatory busing for school desegregation, partly by diverting
some $4 million a year in city tax revenues to finance projects
designed to attract a racial balance by voluntary school
registration.
   Also on the ballot are Mountaineers Club president Carsten Lien
and advertising man David Stern, credited with creating the smiling
yellow ``happy face.'' The face figured in a 1967 ad campaign for a
local bank, and Stern's using it now in his own campaign.
   For whose who call the vacantly smiling circle superficial, Stern
counters: ``The Happy Face is not frivolous. It's a symbol of my
optimism, and that's important. We need optimism. I'm very
optimistic about this city.''
   Candidates with almost no visible campaign organizations are Herb
Gandy, a Boeing Co. photographer; Bob Hegamin, a retired City Light
engineer; Pete Mitchell, a Ballard business operator; Robbie Scherr,
a Socialist Workers Party activist; Constance Paulson, a Navy
veteran; and Bob Willmott, founder of the free food and shelter
group Strand Helpers.

   The Hatfields and McCoys don't fight

   The Matewan Development Center, located in the only three-story
building in the town of 800, features a photo display on the
massacre and other incidents in the town's history. It draws a few
people a week. McAllister is hoping the National Park Service will
help turn Matewan into a tourist attraction. He envisions a museum,
for instance, within 10 years.
   It's been 100 years this month since a jury sentenced eight
Hatfield clan members to life in prison and ordered a ninth hanged
for the slaying of five McCoys, ending the bloodshed in which 10 to
20 people died.
   But most participants died of old age. The Hatfields' patriarch,
William Anderson ``Devil Anse'' Hatfield, got religion and gained
community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83. His grave
at Sarah Ann in Logan County is marked by a towering Italian marble
sculpture of him. The leader of the McCoys, Randolph ``Old Ran'l''
McCoy, embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children, moved to
town in Pikeville, Ky., dying in 1910 at age 85.
   Buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the
heart of Appalachia.
   What is known is that the Hatfields, living mainly in what is now
Mingo County, W.Va., and the McCoys, in Pike County, Ky., fought on
and off for a dozen years in the region's wooded tangle of valleys
and ridges.
   Some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the
McCoys and ended up in a Hatfield pen. Others say the dispute
stemmed from the Civil War, in which, this version goes, the
Hatfields fought for the Confederacy and the McCoys the Union.
Others say both families fought for the South.
   Romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between
Johnse Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy, and that she eventually bore him
a child out of wedlock.
   In a 1988 book ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
Appalachia, 1860-1900,'' author Altina Waller contends the feud was
the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on
subsistence farming, represented by the McCoys, and the emergence of
capitalism fueled by coal mining, timber cutting and railroad
interests in the Hatfields' region.
   Whatever the cause, open warfare between the families began in
1882 when Devil Anse's brother, Ellison Hatfield, was stabbed two
dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in Pike County.
The Hatfields seized the three McCoys responsible, and when Ellison
died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed.
   The feud escalated until New Year's Day 1888, when the Hatfields
attacked the McCoy home in Pike County, burning it to the ground and
killing two of Old Ran'l's children.
   The governors of Kentucky and West Virginia became involved in a
jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Now, McAllister's organization is trying to find a way to
commemorate the feud and the 1920 Matewan Massacre, a downtown
gunbattle between United Mine Workers sympathizers and coal company
guards in which at least nine people died. The incident was depicted
in the 1987 movie ``Matewan.''
   Robert McCoy, a former Matewan mayor, is among those who had to
grow up with the stigma attached to the feud, even though his branch
of the family had economic ties to Devil Anse and never took part in
the bloodshed.
   ``Not every McCoy or every Hatfield participated in the
shootouts,'' McCoy said. ``We're directly related to the so-called
feudists, but we weren't participants in the violent part of it.''
   But McCoy also is on the Matewan Development Center's board of
directors, whose plans call for historic restoration downtown.
   ``As a member of the family, I probably get a little tired of it.
Through the years, ever since I was in high school, it has been
brought to my attention,'' he said.
   ``But as a community, I think it's one of our great hopes for
economic survival here.''

<HEAD>World Bank Finds 1988 Good for Rich Countries, Mixed in Third World</HEAD>

   Richer countries like the United States had a
good year in 1988 and so did some in the Third World like South
Korea and India, the World Bank reported Sunday, but incomes in
Latin America and southern Africa continued to fall.
   The bank said 21 industrial countries, from Luxembourg to the
United States, increased their production by a combined 4.2 percent.
Since their populations increase slowly, the average income of each
citizen went up almost as much.
   Some countries in Asia had much bigger increases in output, but
populations grow faster there, holding down per capita growth.
   The bank is owned by 151 governments, with the United States
holding the largest block of shares.
   Bank representatives gather here this week for the annual meeting
of the bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary
Fund. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will represent the United
States and President Bush is expected to speak.
   A major topic will be progress made with Brady's new attempt to
cut the burden of Third World countries' $1.3 trillion debt and the
$131 billion they had to pay on it last year. He wants banks to
forgive some debt or lower interest rates instead of just lending
new money. The first deals have been worked out for Mexico and the
Philippines. Critics call them too small to let the debtor countries
keep the money they need to create jobs, raise their low incomes and
buy goods from the United States and others.
   ``The central goal of the World Bank is the reduction of
poverty,'' the annual report said. ``Ways to achieve that are at the
heart of the bank's activities.''
   It concentrated heavily on loans to countries in southern Africa.
Except for the Republic of South Africa, which does not borrow from
the bank, that is one of the world's poorest areas.
   The World Bank gets most of its funds from profits generated on
loans _ just over $1.09 billion in the past year. Since no dividends
are paid, all the profits are plowed back into the bank's lending.
Officials point out that the bank's object is to raise living
standards in the borrowing countries, not to make money.
   Its annual economic survey concentrated on low-income countries
and found that China and India were the fastest growing in that
category _ China with 11.2 percent growth and India with 8 percent.
   India remained the biggest borrower from the bank, as it has been
in recent years, taking about $3 billion. Despite its record of
growth, India remains one of the poorest countries. The bank
estimated the income of the average Indian both at $300 dollars in
1987, the most recent figure available. The Chinese average was $290.
   ``The newly industrialized economies of East Asia continued their
strong growth, also over 8 percent as a group,'' the bank said.
   The newly industrialized group includes such countries as South
Korea with a $2,690 average income in 1987 and Singapore with a
$7,940 average.
   ``It is also notable that a number of `second-tier' newly
industrializing countries _ Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in
particular _ are moving into higher performance categories,'' the
report said.
   Production grew by only 1.4 percent in Latin America and the
Caribbean. That was slower than the growth of population, so average
incomes were down again. In southern Africa, production growth
reached 3 percent, but the high birth rate resulted in a another
drop of average incomes.

   Mother Teresa developed mild chest pains
again Sunday, but doctors treating the Nobel laureate said her
overall condition remained stable.
   Doctors also said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun has
contracted a malaria parasite, but insisted it is not the cause of a
recurring fever.
   A statement Sunday evening from Woodlands Nursing Home, the
hospital where Mother Teresa is recovering from a heart attack, said
her condition did not change during the day.
   ``The mother has had mild chest pains but her temperature is
showing signs of settling,'' the statement said. ``She slept well in
the afternoon after having a light meal.''
   A nun at the Missionaries of Charity, the Calcutta-based order
established nearly 40 years ago, said Mother Teresa was ``very, very
weak.''
   ``It's difficult to say how serious (her condition) is. One day
she seems fine and getting better and the next day she's not,'' the
nun said on condition of anonoymity.
   Doctors had hoped Mother Teresa would recover faster since they
diagnosed the cause of an infection they fear posed a new danger.
They refused to disclose the nature of the infection.
   Mother Teresa still is using a temporary pacemaker attached after
she suffered a heart attack on Sept. 8. She first developed chest
pains and high fever Thursday just as doctors thought she was
progressing well.
   A Vatican newspaper reported Saturday that Pope John Paul II had
instructed his envoy in India, Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, to
visit Mother Teresa in the hospital, ``expressing with his presence
the solidarity of the pope and of the church.''

<TEXT>
   It may not be the crime of the century when
your neighbor fails to corral his 45 cats or stocks his yard with
junked cars, but it's the kind of crime Judge Larry Potter
understands.
   Potter runs one of at least 12 local courts around the country
that focus exclusively on ``environmental'' cases: violations of
sanitation, building or fire codes.
   ``It's been called the `rat court,' and a large number of our
cases do involve rat infestations,'' Potter said.
   He started his one-day-a-week environmental court in 1982 and
spends a good bit of his time now telling other cities how to set up
similar operations.
   ``These matters can be very important even though what we
generally think of as environmental problems are toxic wastes,''
Potter said. ``These are cases that affect us all on a day-to-day
basis. Cities nationwide are contacting us. It's a concept whose
time has come.''
   Potter, a city judge, uses his court to force reluctant landlords
to maintain their property, make would-be trash dumpers shy away
from vacant lots and even force lazy homeowners to mow their lawns.
   It takes a bit of creative judicial work since municipal courts
like Potter's have limited powers. He can put people in jail only in
extreme cases and for short periods of time, and the fines he can
impose for a single violation are small.
   But Potter said he discovered early on that he can string those
small fines into a big one if he decides a person is guilty of a
``continuing violation.''
   If, for example, city inspectors show that the toilet in a rental
apartment has been broken for a month, Potter can charge the
landlord $50 for each day it did not work and each day it remains
broken.
   ``Then you really do get their attention,'' he said.
   Potter lacks the authority to order a landlord to fix such a
toilet but when he offers a dramatic cut in the cumulative fine,
repairs are generally made in short order.
   All environmental cases filed with the city court go before
Potter and he deals each Friday afternoon with 10 to 30 defendants.
   Edith Beaty, state coordinator of a citizens' group called the
Clean Tennessee Program, said Potter's was one of the first two or
three municipal courts in the country to put all environmental cases
before the same judge.
   ``There are now at least a dozen and there may be 18
environmental courts or environmental dockets across the country,''
said Ms. Beaty, also the state representative for Keep America
Beautiful Inc., a national environmental-quality group.
   Setting up an environmental court saves money, increases
efficiency and helps assure that cases involving sewer leaks or fire
hazards are given adequate attention, she said.
   ``If I were a judge and I had somebody in front of me for rape or
burglary and the next case was somebody with litter in his yard,
which am I going to be concerned with?'' Ms. Beaty said.
   And city inspectors who look for fire, housing or sanitation code
violations are more vigorous when they know there is a judge who
will hear their cases, she said.
   ``In the old days,'' she said, ``they used the courts as a
bluff.''
   Since the Memphis court began its environmental docket, city
inspectors have attended annual seminars on how to present their
arguments to a judge, Potter said.
   And his Friday afternoon sessions, he said, often attract groups
of spectators from citizens' organizations interested in
neighborhood preservation.
   ``They don't always win but they like to see that something is
being done,'' he said. ``They felt for years that nothing was being
done.''

<TEXT>
   War veterans, young people and Solidarity
activists on Sunday quietly marked the 50th anniversary of the
invasion of Poland by the Soviet Red Army.
   The government appealed for dignified demonstrations, and the
observations were small compared to those held Sept. 1 for the 50th
anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland that started World War II.
   But for Poles, Sept. 17, 1939, was just as tragic. When the Red
Army entered from the east Poland was divided and millions were
deported, killed, or forced to remain in the Soviet Union after the
war.
   ``May Sept. 17, 1939, never be repeated in any nation again,''
Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz told more than 100,000 pilgrims at an
annual workers' Mass in the southern city of Czestochowa.
   The new Solidarity government, in an appeal on national
television Saturday night, upheld the right to mark the event but
urged that ceremonies be held in a calm manner.
   The appeal for calm was repeated throughout Sunday on the radio.
In previous years, demonstrations on the anniversary were often
broken up by police.
   In Warsaw, about 1,000 people met at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier to lay wreaths representing the Home Army, the underground
resistance force that fought both the Nazis and the Red Army; the
Warsaw chapter of Solidarity; and the Confederation for an
Independent Poland, a small independence group.
   ``Fifty years of spitting at our history. These are the effects
of Sept. 1 and Sept. 17, the effects of the plot by the two biggest
criminals in world history _ Hitler and Stalin,'' Edward Bohdan, a
Home Army veteran, told the crowd.
   Many of the same group later went to a monument in Warsaw's
Powazki military cemetery for the more than 4,000 Polish officers
killed by Soviet security forces in the Katyn forest in 1940.
   Bohdan said reconciliation with the Soviets would not be possible
until ``they (Soviets) tell the truth'' about the massacre. The
Soviets maintain the officers were killed by the Nazis, while Polish
and Western documents say the Soviets were responsible.
   In the Baltic port of Gdansk, supporters of the still-banned
Independent Students Union and other youth groups held a rally as
did activists of Fighting Solidarity, a hard-line splinter group
that opposes dialogue with Communists.
   This year, as a result of the more tolerant political climate in
Poland, even hard-line newspapers such as the Communist Party daily
Trybuna Ludu have carried reports on what happened during and after
the Soviet invasion.
   Those facts have been well known to a large part of the Polish
public for many years as a result of teachings in church,
independent publications, and the experience of Poles who lived
through the war.
   Trybuna Ludu said Saturday that the Soviet invasion resulted in
repression and mass crimes involving millions of Poles.
   ``The date of Sept. 17 is deeply rooted in the consciousness of
the Polish nation. Especially because the entry of Soviet troops was
followed by growing repressions, and even mass crimes which involved
millions of Poles,'' Trybuna Ludu said.
   Gradually, the party has been opening archives and treating the
subject of the Soviet invasion and other painful events with greater
frankness.
   In Czestochowa, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told more than
100,000 workers that a decade of struggle for union rights had
finally succeeded.
   Speaking at the end of a Mass at the Jasna Gora monastery, Walesa
said that ``We have come here to give thanks for our regained
rights.''
   A year ago, Walesa told a smaller crowd that legal recognition of
the long-banned union was ``very close.'' Solidarity then had just
agreed to end a wave of strikes and enter into talks with
authorities.
   The union was legalized and now Solidarity's Tadeusz Masowiecki
heads the government as prime minister.

<HEAD>Armenia, Faced With Economic ``Blockade,'' Plans Appeal to Kremlin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in Armenia, under virtual economic
blockade from neighboring Azerbaijan, met in emergency session
Sunday to ask the Kremlin for help in restoring deliveries of food
and fuel, activists said.
   On Saturday, the legislature of Azerbaijan again laid claim to
Nagorno-Karabakh, a hilly region mostly populated by Armenians that
has been the focus of a bloody territorial conflict between the two
Soviet republics for the 18 months.
   Speaking by telephone from Yerevan, Armenia's capital, an editor
at the official Armenpress news agency said that during the past 14
days, not a single freight car with cargo has arrived in Armenia
over rail routes originating in Azerbaijan.
   The editor, who was cut off before he could give his name, said
5,000 freight cars were also overdue in the area of Armenia that was
devastated by an earthquake in December. The earthquake killed
25,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said the republic's Communist
Party chief, Suren Arutyunyan, told Armenia's legislature at the
emergency session that ``during the past two months Armenia has not
been receiving food, construction materials or food due to the
blockade.''
   A resolution submitted for the Armenian Supreme Soviet's
consideration denounces the blockade as ``an act of aggression'' and
demands the national Moscow-based legislature take urgent measures
to restore shipments to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh within 24
hours, Popoyan said.
   The special session of the Armenian legislature will also
consider the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, which was part of mostly
Moslem Azerbaijan for more than 65 years despite its largely
Armenian and Christian population.
   More than 100 people have died in ethnic bloodshed since Armenia
and Azerbaijan began fighting over the district in February 1988. In
an attempt to end the killing, the Kremlin placed the district under
its direct control in February.
   Azerbaijan's parliament reaserted its right to rule
Nagorno-Karabakh on Saturday, calling the district an integral part
of the republic and noting that the Soviet Constitution classifies
it as such.
   The intractable quarrel will be one of the thorniest problems
faced by the Soviet Communist Party leadership when it meets Tuesday
in Moscow to try to redefine policy towards the country's more than
130 ethnic groups and seek solutions to ethnic conflicts.
   Soviet press accounts have commonly blamed the cutoff in freight
shipments to Armenia on striking Azerbaijani railway workers. But
the scope of the blockade indicates officials in Azerbaijan either
are taking an active part in it or are doing little to end it.
   State-run Radio Moscow reported Sunday that the single rail
station in Nagorno-Karabakh, in the administrative center of
Stepanakert, has been out of operation for 10 days because trains
bound there are halted 13 miles away in the Azerbaijan city of Agdam.
   By road, ``convoys with fuel and food bound for Nagorno-Karabakh
are stopped in the adjoining (Azerbaijani) areas,'' the radio added.
   For lack of fuel, farm work in the district has stopped, Radio
Moscow said. ``No fuel is available for private cars. Even
ambulances, emergency service vehicles and police cars receive
rationed fuel supplies,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Steven Stayner, kidnapped at the age of 7
and forced to live as the sexually abused foster son of his abductor
until he escaped seven years later, has been killed in a hit-and-run
traffic accident.
   ``He sure led a rough life,'' California Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill
Balestra said of Stayner, who was returned to his parents less than
10 years ago and was the subject of an NBC miniseries in May, titled
``I Know My First Name Is Steven.''
   Balestra said Stayner, 24, married and the father of two
children, was killed Saturday when a car pulled into the path of his
motorcycle on a highway between Merced and Atwater, some 70 miles
east of San Francisco.
   Balestra said officers believe they knew the identity of the
driver of the car, who abandoned his car two miles away, jumped into
another car and fled. He said felony hit-run charges were planned.
   The officer said the car had pulled out of a private driveway and
crossed in front of Stayner, who then ran into it.
   Balestra said Stayner, who the CHP reported had been riding
without a helmet, ``suffered massive head injuries'' and was
pronounced dead on arrival at Merced Community Medical Center.
   In 1972, when he was 7, Stayner was grabbed off a street in
Merced while walking home from school. Seven years later, his
abductor snatched another boy, 5-year-old Timmy White; 16 days
later, on March 1, 1980, Stayner walked into a Ukiah police station
with Timmy, saying he didn't want the younger boy subjected to the
same abuse he experienced.
   Kenneth Parnell, arrested while working as a hotel clerk in
Ukiah, 150 miles from Merced, was convicted of two counts of
kidnapping. He was sentenced to eight years and eight months in
prison in February 1982 after a sensational 18-day trial in Hayward.
   Parnell served five years in prison, then was paroled for another
two years. Released from parole, Parnell, now 57, is believed living
somewhere in northern California. He had previously been imprisoned
for sexually abusing an 8-year-old boy he kidnapped in Bakersfield.
   While no sex charges were filed against Parnell, Stayner
testified at Parnell's trial that he was ordered to call Parnell
``dad'' during his captivity and that he was regularly sexually
abused. He said they lived in California motels and trailer parks
during the period.
   He said Parnell convinced him a court had awarded him custody
because Stayner's family could no longer afford him. Because he had
been taught that adults don't lie, Stayner said, he believed
Parnell's story and didn't realize he had been kidnapped.
   ``I felt a little guilty being the one to turn him in after all
he'd given me all those Christmases,'' Steve said in an interview
several years later with The Associated Press. ``It was hard to face
him.''
   Steve's remorse turned to anger after he returned home to his
parents, three sisters and a brother, ``and saw what I had missed
out on all those years. Then I felt good about it and proud that I
turned him in.''
   His parents, however, found that their sunny, obedient 7-year-old
had become a tough 14-year-old who liked to smoke, drink, hitchhike
and party as late as he pleased. He later ran up $1,100 in traffic
fines and lost his driver's license.
   In 1985, Stayner married Jody Edmondson in Atwater. At the time
of his death, he and his wife were living with their two children,
age 2 and 3.
   Stayner had a walk-on role as a Merced police officer in the NBC
miniseries, which was broadcast May 21-22.
   In April, he told The Santa Rosa Press Democrat: ``My hope with
the movie is that some kid sees it and gets up the nerve to tell
someone and try to come home.''
   He said he had hoped his life would not be depicted as a horror
story.
   ``It was just not that way. I tried to make my life as normal as
I could. I had a lot of good times when I was there. I was basically
an everyday kid. I got into trouble. I ditched high school. I was
like most kids except that I wasn't with my natural parents.''

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Leader Says Peace Talks Likely To Fail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi says Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko's attempt to
negotiate an end to the civil war in his country is likely to fail
and another mediator should be found.
   Savimbi's remarks Saturday night appeared to rule out any hope
that an African summit Monday in Kinshasa, the Zairean capital,
would reinstate a truce in Angola's 14-year-old civil war.
   ``I think Mobutu is not the only one who can make the
reconciliation happen. ... I don't see how he is going to continue.
I think he is going to fail,'' Savimbi told reporters.
   Without naming anyone, Savimbi also said, ``time will prove that
somebody was telling lies to one of the sides.''
   At issue are claims that Savimbi agreed to go into exile and
permit the integration if his guerrilla forces into the Angolan
army. Savimbi repeatedly has denied agreeing to either condition.
   His National Union for the Total Independence of Angola wants to
contest elections to win a share in a government which, with Cuban
and Soviet aid, fought its way to power when Portuguese colonizers
hastily withdrew from the southern African nation in 1975.
   The U.S. State Department released a statement Sunday saying it
``strongly supports (the guerrillas) and its goals of national
reconciliation followed by free and fair elections.
   ``The United States does not accept the concept of `exile,
amnesty or integration,''' it said.
   Savimbi said he will not attend the Kinshasa summit, despite
pressure from his backers in Washington, unless Mobutu disassociates
himself from efforts to force him into exile.
   The Angolan rebels get $15 million a year from the United States,
funneled through Zaire. Mobutu also has given the guerrilla leader
substantial assistance.
   But on Saturday, Savimbi accused Mobutu of siding with Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   He said it would be possible for someone else to take over the
peace negotiations.
   ``We are for genuine reconciliation, for a lasting peace. If
anyone will negotiate this ... We are for him,'' said Savimbi.
   He was in Abidjan for a meeting with Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, whom African diplomats said he favored to take
over as mediator.
   Savimbi also said fighting had intensified in Angola in the last
two weeks with his guerrillas killing nearly 1,000 government troops
while losing 300 men. Officials of the Luanda government also have
reported increased fighting.
   Under an agreement mediated by Mobutu, a cease-fire began June
24. Fighting quickly resumed with dos Santos accusing the rebels of
widespread violations.
   Savimbi acknowledged some attacks, saying it was difficult to
communicate with thousands of irregulars spread across the country,
but also charged dos Santos with launching a major offensive.
   Savimbi added that reports he had accepted money to go into exile
had angered some of his supporters and provoked them to launch
attacks despite the cease-fire. Several African heads of state have
said Mobutu told them Savimbi had agreed to go into exile.
   The guerrilla leader said his troops have turned back an
offensive by 10,000 government soldiers without help from South
Africa, whose troops would intervene before an agreement last year
for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola in return for
Namibian independence.

<HEAD>U.S. Sending AID Team to Caribbean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development
announced Sunday it had sent a team to the Caribbean to determine
whether emergency relief will be needed to cope with damage from
Hurricane Hugo.
   A team of two people was on the Caribbean Island of Antigua and
another two people have been sent to Barbados, an AID official said.
   ``The team in Barbados is carrying with them a portable satellite
communications unit, which will enable them to relay disaster relief
information and emergency needs from the disaster site back to'' the
Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, AID announced in a news
release.
   ``At the present time, no emergency relief aid has been requested
by the affected islands,'' the announcement said.
   An AID worker, Arthur Feller, said reports from Antigua indicated
that by Sunday afternoon the storm had caused little damage.
   ``In the last conversation we had with our people in Antigua,
they said there was a lot of wind and a lot of rain, but no one was
hurt,'' said Feller.
   Asked whether AID planned to send food or other relief there,
Feller said, ``It is not clear that it is needed. If it is needed,
we can move very fast.''
   According to dispatches from the Caribbean, Hugo hit the resort
islands with 140 mph winds Sunday, tearing off roofs, knocking out
communications and reportedly leaving 3,000 people homeless.
   The region's most powerful storm in a decade then swept toward
the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Both governments mobilized
the National Guard, and residents rushed for last-minute supplies
and taped and boarded windows.

<HEAD>Dole Plugs For Bush's Capital Gains Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said Sunday
that while expanding individual retirement account benefits would be
more politically popular, cutting the top capital gains tax rate
would be of greater benefit overall.
   Dole said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that President Bush is ``on
the right course'' pressing for a cut in taxes on profits from the
sale of stocks, real estate and other investments. The House Ways
and Means Committee last week approved the reduction.
   ``Let's create some jobs. Let's make the cost of capital
cheaper,'' which would make the country more competitive on the
world market, Dole said. He conceded, though, that ``I assume the
IRA politically is more popular.''
   The Kansas Republican said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's proposal to
restore partial tax deductions on contributions to IRAs is ``a great
idea,'' but he said the proposal would cost $12 billion or more over
a five-year period and ``where do you find the money?''
   Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
defended his proposal on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' saying both his
plan and the capital gains tax cut would lose money for five years
before benefits would be seen.
   But he said his plan would help ``average folks _ far more people
would be able to take advantage of it than could a capital gains
cut.''
   His proposal would allow a deduction of at least 50 percent for
all IRA accounts and would allow the withdrawal of IRA funds without
penalty _ even prior to retirement _ for a downpayment on the
purchase of a first home or to finance college costs.
   ``What it really does is get those interest rates down in this
country so we can be competitive with foreign nations,'' Bentsen
said. ``And it'd let people pay for that college education for their
children and to buy that first home that's getting tougher and
tougher to accomplish.''
   Bentsen said his plan could be accomplished without raising
taxes, but pressed on where the money would be found, he said,
``there's no way I can accomplish that on a show of this duration.''
   On another controversial topic, Dole and Bentsen found themselves
in basic agreement, both saying they will try to block efforts to
repeal the Medicare catastrophic program but will work to scale back
benefits to reduce costs to senior citizens.
   ``I'm going to move the bill back to what it was when it was
originally introduced,'' which would give Medicare beneficiaries the
option of taking the catastrophic insurance, Bentsen said.
   Both senators said they want to reduce substantially or eliminate
the surtax on Medicare beneficiaries _ a maximum of $800, or $1,600
for a couple, this year _ that has raised intense and vocal
opposition among the elderly.
   ``Let's don't throw out all the benefits, because even though
senior citizens are upset, they're going to need some of those
benefits. We've got to provide the leadership, and we've got to take
the heat for it,'' Dole said.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a prime mover behind the program
designed to protect the elderly against catastrophic illness, said
he wants to see the surtax eliminated and the program scaled back to
cover only hospitalization costs associated with a catastrophic
illness and provisions that prevent a spouse from having to
impoverish themselves to qualify for coverage.
   Other provisions, including coverage of outpatient prescription
drugs, should be stripped from the program to lower costs, he said.
   ``We've got to repeal the surtax, keep what we can, particularly
catastrophic illness insurance, which is what we promised the
American people, and then go back and address the real issue that
the seniors want in this country, and that's long term care,''
McCain said on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday.''
   ``I think there's a basic recognition that something needs to be
done; the question is what,'' he said.

   East German and Czechoslovak authorities
have begun seizing passports to stop the flood of refugees fleeing
to the West, East German emigres said Sunday.
   Hungary's foreign minister, meanwhile, defended his country's
decision to aid the immigrant exodus and said the Warsaw Pact should
stick to military defense and not dictate ideology or foreign policy
to its members.
   In West Germany, officials said they registered 1,400 new East
German refugees during the weekend, bringing to more than 16,000 the
number of East Germans who have arrived since Hungary threw open its
borders to the West one week ago.
   East German officials have said they would not crack down on
visas for citizens wishing to visit Hungary. But refugees and
charity workers at camps in Hungary said travel documents were in
fact being seized.
   ``More and more people are telling us that their visas are being
taken from them,'' said Wolfgang Wagner, head of the West German
Maltese Aid Service. ``Some have told me that state security had
come to their apartments to take the visas.''
   Others were forced off East German and Czechoslovak trains and
returned home, Wagner said in an interview. A growing number were
forced to swim the Danube ``or find other illegal means of coming
here,'' he said.
   Going through Czechoslovakia, between East Germany and Hungary,
is the most direct route for East Germans seeking to take advantage
of Hungary's open western border.
   A 25-year-old man from East Berlin said he and 15 others entered
Hungary Saturday on foot after crowding into three cars and crashing
through several Czechoslovak border barriers at the Rajka crossing,
about 85 miles northwest of Budapest.
   He said police in Bratislava took away their travel documents,
and at one point they were held at submachine-gun point until they
pledged they would not head toward the Hungarian border.
   Hungary's role in the refugee affair has been condemned by
hard-line Warsaw Pact allies. A senior Communist foreign policy
adviser here spoke of Soviet anxiety.
   ``It's a fact that there is noticeable worry on the part of the
Soviet Union,'' Gyula Thuermer was quoted as saying in the Vasarnapi
Hirek newspaper. ``They are worried that Hungarian events will
become incalculable, and they are also disturbed that there are open
disagreements among their allies.''
   The Soviets have criticized West Germany but have refrained from
directly accusing Hungary of wrongdoing. But Czechoslovakia and
Romania, distrustful of Hungary's plans to hold free elections in
June and other reforms, have joined East Germany in condemning
Hungary.
   Hungary, however, is seeking stronger economic ties with the West
and has embraced social and political reform.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said the Warsaw Pact should
stop debating Communist ideology and concentrate on the East bloc's
defense.
   He was quoted by the Yugoslav daily Politika as saying the Warsaw
Pact ``cannot determine what foreign policy steps its individual
members should take.''
   ``The Warsaw Pact should ... not deal with ideological issues, or
with how the political situation in individual member countries is
developing,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Hungary's break with its hard-line Warsaw Pact allies have won
praise in the West, and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher proposed Sunday a West European aid program of to support
reforms in East Europe.
   Genscher, speaking in a radio interview, compared his proposal to
the U.S. Marshall Plan that helped reconstruct Western Europe after
World War II. He said the plan should include food aid, rescheduling
of credits and credit guarantees for Western investments.
   ``The aim of the plan should not be to enable those socialist
states that refuse reforms to survive a bit longer, but to give a
chance to reform-minded forces'' such as Poland, Genscher said in an
interview with West Berlin's RIAS radio station.
   In Austria, border authorities registered more than 1,600 East
Germans Sunday who crossed during the night from Hungary. West
German border officials in Bavaria registered more than 1,400
weekend arrivals by early Sunday.
   The total number of East Germans who have used Hungary for
passage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25,000,
with many fleeing illegally after Hungary demonstrated its opening
to the West in May by removing some border fortifications with
Austria.

   A pocket of methane gas killed a man
cleaning a well, then killed two men who were tryint ot rescue him,
authorities said.
   Jerry Buckner, 31, and Gary Harden, 26, both of Calhoun, were
clearing land Saturday to make room for a trailer in this community
about 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, and Buckner climbed into
the well to clear it, said Jim Mullins, a sheriff's dispatcher.
   Buckner was overcome by methane and died almost immediately,
police said. Harden ran to call rescuers, then returned, entered the
well and also was overcome by the gas.
   David McCullum, 27, an emergency medical technician with a county
rescue squad, entered the well without an airpack and also was
overcome, Mullins said. McCullum was pronounced dead on arrival at a
hospital.
   Methane gas can be formed by sewage, fertilizer and other
products, but ``how that exact pocket got there, I don't know,''
said Blake Bowers, an operations officer with the Tennessee
Emergency Management Agency.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin will visit Egypt
to discuss President Hosni Mubarak's plan for ending the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories, officials said Sunday.
   Arab reports said Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 36
Palestinians during clashes Sunday with stone-throwing protesters in
six villages and refugee camps. The army said it was checking the
reports.
   During the 21-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, 572 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers or Israeli
civilians and 114 have been slain by fellow Arabs who suspected them
of collaborating with Israel. Forty Israelis have been killed.
   Rabin's trip Monday comes before an expected flurry of Middle
East diplomacy at the U.N. General Assembly during which Israeli,
Egyptian and U.S. officials are to discuss Mubarak's peace proposals.
   Elias Freij, the Palestinian Mayor of Bethlehem in the occupied
West Bank, returned Sunday from a trip to Tunisia where he said he
urged PLO chief Yasser Arafat to endorse Mubarak's ideas.
   Freij is the first Palestinian leader in the West Bank to
publicly announce a meeting with Arafat, in defiance of an Israeli
law that bans meetings with leaders of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Israel Television reported.
   U.S. State Department officials have said Mubarak's 10-point
peace plan, recently presented to Israeli officials, could be useful
in reviving Israel's proposal for Palestinian elections in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But the Egyptian move also has caused a rift between the two
major parties in Israel's coalition Cabinet.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes
Mubarak's demand that Israel agree to trade land for peace. It also
opposes giving Arabs in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem the right to
vote in Palestinian elections.
   The left-leaning Labor Party, headed by Vice Premier Shimon
Peres, accepts both points.
   Rabin's trip, approved Sunday by the Cabinet, immediately touched
off a new debate between the two parties. Recent media reports have
portrayed the defense minister as an avid supporter of negotiations
based on Mubarak's plan.
   Likud ministers met after the weekly Cabinet session and issued a
statement rejecting Mubarak's initiative, saying it gives too much
ground to the Palestinians.
   Shamir's election plan, presented to the United States in April,
calls for choosing Palestinians to negotiate an interim peace for
the occupied territories, with the final status of those territories
to be decided later.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The Israeli proposal omits the question of future boundaries
because of Likud opposition to withdrawing from the territories.
   Mubarak has also offered to arrange a Palestinian delegation to
negotiate with Israel that would include two men recently deported
from the occupied lands.
   The proposal is designed to satisfy both Israel's demand that it
meet only Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, and the PLO's
insistence that Palestinians from outside the territories be
included in peace talks.
   Israel officially refuses to talk to the PLO, which it views as a
terrorist group.
   ``If we keep making concessions, then all we do is move into a
trap set by the Palestinians,'' said Yitzhak Modai, Likud's Economic
Planning Minister. ``A Palestinian state would endanger our
existence. It will not happen.''
   Labor leaders, however, strongly urged Israel to agree to
negotiations based on Mubarak's plan as a way to end an impasse in
peace efforts.
   ``In my view, for the first time there is a chance for a
Palestinian delegation to negotiations,'' Peres said on Israel radio.
   Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny, who extended the
invitation to Rabin, said Sunday:
   ``Of course Mr. Rabin is a key in the peace process ... Now the
ball is on the Israeli side. If you (Israel) agree, next month you
will see an Israeli delegation and a Palestinian delegation meeting
in Cairo to discuss and talk about these problems.
   ``Can you imagine,'' Bassiouny added, ``next month the wheels of
peace will start.''
   The Israeli government has formally agreed to put off a decision
on the plan until Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens return from
visits to the United States, where both are expected to meet Mubarak
and U.S. officials.
   The Egyptian plan has caused a split in the Palestinian side as
well. The PLO has announced it also will put off final judgment on
the plan until October, but the Moslem fundamentalist movement
Hamas, or Zeal, has condemned it.
   ``No to Mubarak's 10-point plan,'' said graffiti signed by Hamas
and scrawled on a wall Sunday in Bethlehem in the West Bank.
   The clashes between troops and Palestinians Sunday came as Arabs
observed a general strike called by Hamas that shut down the
occupied territories. It was called to mark the anniversary of the
massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Israel's Christian allies in
the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in Beirut in 1982.

   A 74-year-old woman says she never
prayed as hard as she did when a flood sent water flowing beneath a
door and under her wheelchair in the nursing home where she lives.
   ``I was yelling. I said, `Look at the water coming under the
door.' I hadn't seen anything like this before,'' Blanche Watson
said.
   ``I told them then I was scared of airplanes, but that if one had
come by last night I would have certainly have hopped on,'' she said
of Friday night's flood, caused by a cloudburst that dropped almost
4 inches of rain in just two hours.
   Two children drowned during the flood in spite of the efforts of
a human-chain rescue team, and at least 400 people were forced to
evacuate. Elsewhere in the East, floods in West Virginia killed two
people.
   Ms. Watson was one of 168 residents evacuated from the America's
Health Care of Fayetteville nursing home. A number of shelters were
set up around the city for them and other evacuees.
   Most of the nursing home residents had to be taken out by boat,
though some were carried through the water and others were pushed
out in their wheelchairs. A few of the able-bodied residents climbed
atop a roof and waited for help.
   No injuries were reported, said Mildred Cross, the nursing home
administrator.
   ``The lightning scared the daylights out of most of us,'' said
nursing home resident Socrates Costas. ``Everybody was in a daze. I
don't know where all the volunteers came from, but they were a lot
of help.''
   Maintenance man James Backman said water was nearly 56 inches
deep in the nursing home's bottom floors.
   On Sunday, Police Lt. C.P. Ware of the situation: ``Everything's
calm. All emergency personnel have gone home.''
   But Ms. Cross, who waded through muddy water in the nursing
home's main halls Saturday while she waited for an insurance
adjuster, said cleanup would be a big job. With furniture covered in
mud and most of the food under water, she didn't expect residents to
be back in their regular rooms right away.
   Mayor J.L. Dawkins said 10 to 15 Marines from Camp Lejeune who
were on their way to Fort Bragg for an exercise had stopped and
assisted the nursing home residents who were evacuated.

<TEXT>
   President Najib said Sunday that U.S.
officials are trying to bolster their aid to anti-communist rebels
by meeting with deposed Afghan King Zahir Shah in Italy.
   Radical Afghan guerrillas with bases in Pakistan threatened to
assassinate the former monarch if he tries to return and head a
postwar government in Kabul.
   The warring sides in Afghan's civil war commented after reports
that an envoy of the United States met with the exiled king in Rome.
Zahir Shah has lived in Italy since his nephew seized power in a
1973 coup.
   In his remarks, Najib said U.S. talks with Zahir Shah were an
attempt ``to bring fresh breath to the abortive military policy of
the U.S. government.'' He did not elaborate.
   However, the president also suggested Zahir Shah could have a
role in a settlement.
   ``We have proposed that all forces within and outside the
country, including Zahir Shah, take part in national
reconciliation,'' Najib said.
   Afghanistan's ruling Marxists and their Soviet backers have
previously said the king could serve as compromise solution to head
a transitional government.
   But hard-line rebels in Islamabad, Pakistan, warned Zahir Shah to
stay away from his homeland.
   ``He takes a very grave risk of being shot,'' said Nawab Salim,
spokesman for the Hezb-i-Islami party run by anti-American Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar. ``The mujahedeen (holy warriors) will not let Zahir Shah
come to Afghanistan.''
   After more than six months of trying to forge unity within the
fractious guerrilla coalition, Washington reportedly is considering
alternatives, including the former monarch.
   But the rebels, who have received millions of U.S. dollars in
military and humanitarian aid during their decade-long war with
successive communist governments, are bitterly divided over a
possible role for the 74-year-old king.
   Abdul Rahim, a spokesman for the guerrillas' government-in-exile,
said a royal return is tantamount to a rebel defeat. ``It would mean
the mujahedeen and the people of Afghanistan are defeated,'' said
Rahim.
   Royalists among the rebels, most notably Syed Gailani's National
Islamic Front of Afghanistan, say the king is the only Afghan able
to rally warring factions.
   Asim Nasser-Zia, a spokesman for Gailani's group, predicted Zahir
Shah will fly to Kabul from Rome in January or February and retire
after convening a traditional Afghan council to oversee general
elections.
   This could happen only after Najib was out of Kabul, he said.
   Pakistan's army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, said Sunday
the Kremlin appears willing to abandon Najib.
   In a briefing for reporters, Beg said Armand Hammer, U.S. oil
magnate and confidante of Moscow's powerbrokers, ``indicated the
Soviets may drop Najib.''
   He recommended the Afghan resistance negotiate with remaining
leaders of the Afghan Communist groups after Najib is removed.
   Talks with the ruling communists represent a radical departure
from Pakistan's earlier policies and is rejected by all rebels,
regardless of political leanings. The rebels have their headquarters
in Pakistan, which also shelters more than 3 million Afghan refugees.
   Salim charged Zahir Shah's possible return is a compromise being
considered by Washington and Moscow because the superpowers are
anxious to extricate themselves from the Afghan war.
   The United States fears a ``so-called fundamentalist''
government, said Salim, whose organization is one of Washington's
greatest critics but also is one of the major benefactors of U.S.
largesse.
   ``The United States is trying to impose him (Zahir Shah) on the
people of Afghanistan,'' said Salim, calling the monarch a
``traitor.''
   The king's greatest crime, according to critics, was to keep
silent during the war, particularly after 1979 when Moscow sent more
than 110,000 soldiers into Afghanistan.
   ``He never cared about the jihad (holy war),'' said Rahim. ``He
never participated practically.''
   The Kremlin withdrew its last troops from Afghanistan on Feb. 15
under a U.N.-brokered accord. Many observers expected the move to
lead to a guerrilla victory, but the divided resistance has not
captured any major towns since the Soviet pullout.
   But a spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla faction, Omar
Sherdul, said 400 government soldiers surrendered to rebels in
western Herat province.

   Crew teams from Oxford and Cambridge universities
rowed past the Sears Tower and Wrigley Building as they moved their
160-year-old rowing rivalry from the River Thames to the Chicago
River.
   The event's organizer, Peter Mowbray, originally wanted Oxford to
compete against a Midwest team, but when he realized no local teams
could match England's talent, he contacted Cambridge.
   Oxford's nine-man crew won Saturday's race by less than half a
length, though it won't count in the official win-loss record
compiled since 1829 _ 69 victories for Cambridge and 66 to Oxford,
which has won 14 of the last 15 matches.
   ``Only London counts, but all of them matter,'' said George
Cheveley, 22, of Oxford. ``We don't ever want to lose to Cambridge.''
   The Chicago race was two miles, about half that of London's, and
had a hairpin turn that prompted a staggered start.
   It was the first time the British universities raced each other
in the United States. The official races are held in March on the
Thames.
   The crews had some time to socialize and see the sights of
Chicago, Cheveley said. ``But when we get to racing together,
there's no love lost on the water.''
   As the Oxford team stepped up to collect their trophies, they
hoisted their 113-pound coxswain _ or steerman _ on their shoulders
and tossed him into the river.
   ``I did a good job, so that's why,'' said Martin Watts, 20, of
London, as he pulled himself up and wrung himself out.

   A Roman Catholic priest said Sunday he would
continue enforcing a dress code at his church despite orders from
his archbishop that he stop refusing Holy Communion to people he
considers inappropriately dressed.
   The Rev. Roger Griese has barred shorts and mini-skirts from
Sacred Heart Church and has turned away from Communion people he
considers immodestly dressed.
   ``I do not refuse the Sacrament ... solely on the grounds of
inappropriate dress, but rather on the unworthy motive of
confrontation and attack which the wearers of inappropriate dress
insist on wearing, even after several warnings,'' Griese said. ``And
this, in simple conscience, I cannot change.''
   Griese told his congregation that Daniel Pilarczyk, the
archbishop of Cincinnati, has threatened him with suspension and
loss of his pastorate.
   ``He threatens me with removal,'' Griese said. ``Well, we'll see.
He doesn't have the right to do that when a person is innocent and
has done no wrong.
   ``If I'm going to be insulted by my own authorities, by my own
mission and staff, I have the right to make an appeal to Rome. And I
won't have any hesitancy about doing that,'' he said.
   Griese read a letter from Pilarczyk to the congregation at the
end of Sunday's Mass.
   In the letter, Pilarczyk told Griese that he too believes people
should come to church appropriately dressed. He said he also
believes it is proper for priests to remind churchgoers of the
respect owed to the church.
   ``At the same time, I do not believe that guidelines for dress
can and should be enforced by refusing the Sacraments to people,''
wrote Pilarczyk.
   ``I have indicated this to you and pointed out that in the future
you may not refuse Holy Communion or absolution in the Sacrament of
Penance purely on the grounds of inappropriate dress.
   ``I suspect that you do not agree with this, but as an obedient
priest you have said that you will carry out my wishes,'' the letter
said.
   Griese accused Pilarczyk of ``letting down the bars'' and
rewarding confronters by chastising a loyal priest who is simply
upholding reverence for the church.
   ``I shall not have that on my conscience,'' Griese said. ``And no
man has the authority or power to force another man's conscience.''
   The 73-year-old Griese said the controversy has caused him to
lose sleep and miss meals.
   ``(But) I'm at peace with God as to what I've done and how I've
done it,'' he said. ``And if that doesn't please the archbishop,
then I'm very sorry. But I have to follow my conscience.''
   Ray George, spokesman for the archdiocese, said Pilarczyk plans
to review Sunday's events at Sacred Heart and that no statement was
immediately planned.

<HEAD>Government Offers Cease-Fire if Extremists Agree to Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Sunday offered a
unilateral cease-fire to Sinhalese extremists if they join an
interparty peace conference that began last week.
   A statement by the president's office said ``there will be no
need for the armed forces to continue their ongoing security
operations'' if leaders of the People's Liberation Front attend the
conference.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa called the meeting in an effort to
end ethnic strife that has taken 16,000 lives in six years. The
inaugural session Wednesday was attended by 21 of Sri Lanka's 27
recognized parties.
   The People's Liberation Front rejected Premadasa's invitation but
the president said he hoped it will attend later sessions. The
meetings are expected to continue through Oct. 12.
   The latest government truce offer came as military officials said
more than 300 people were killed last week in attacks by Liberation
Front extremists and reprisal raids by pro-government vigilante
groups.
   Vigilantes reportedly killed 150 people in repeated attacks on
three Kandy district villages on Friday and Saturday, apparently in
retaliation for the killing of three soldiers' relatives in Kandy by
Liberation Front gunmen.
   The government did not confirm the attacks on Menikhinna,
Kundasala and Aranagala, 50 miles northeast of Colombo.
   But a senior military official said the government had ordered a
major crackdown on vigilante groups.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said 45
members of the armed forces were arrested on suspicion of
participating in vigilante groups.
   ``It is evident the current situation is being exploited by
unidentified armed groups for their own purposes. This has led to a
proliferation of weapons in our society. A positiive response by the
Front to the call for peace and normalcy will enable the
identification of these groups,'' the presidential statement said.
   A separate government statement Sunday said 16 bodies of young
Sinhalese men were found in southern towns with notes nearby
purportedly signed by the People's Liberation Red Army. The
Liberation Red Army is one of five known pro-governement groups.
   The government has denied it supports the Liberation Red Army or
other groups such as the Black Cats, Yellow Cats, Green Tigers and
the People's Revolutionary Army.
   Opposition lawmakers and human rights organizations claim the
government encourages such groups to intensify the crackdown on the
Liberation Front, an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to
overthrow the government.
   A military offical said the death toll during the week passed
300. He said 100 buildings were also burned in seven days, the worst
week of violence in recent months.
   Independent sources said the death toll exceeded 350 and 250
buildings were burned.
   The government says more than 5,000 people have been killed in
the two-year campaign by the Liberation Front and blames the
extremists for most deaths. The Front says vigilantes are
responsible for many killings.
   Liberation Front rebels began their campaign of assassinations
and terrororist attacks to protest the government's peace overtures
to Tamil secessionists in the northeast.
   The Front said an accord two years ago that was sponsored by
India made too many concessions to the minority Tamils, who comprise
18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   Liberation Front leaders also opposed the presence of Indian
peacekeeping soldiers, deployed in the northeast to supervise the
1987 accord. The largest Tamil group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, reneged on the accord and began attacking the Indian troops.
At least 1,000 Indian soldiers have been killed in the fighting.
   The Tamil rebels are attending the peace conference.
   The Tamil secession, which began in 1983 with complaints of
discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese-dominated
government, has claimed up to 10,000 Sri Lankan lives.
   Sinhalese, most of whom are Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and the military. Tamils are
predominantly Buddhists.
   India became involved in the ethnic problems of its southeastern
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to
the rebel cause.

   About 40 peace activists carrying banners
and beating drums began a 200-mile march Sunday to protest the use
of nuclear power in the U.S. space program and by the military.
   The three-week march began at Cape Canaveral, where the Navy's
nuclear-armed Trident 2 missile system is tested, and will take
demonstrators to Kings Bay, Ga., where the missiles are to be
deployed aboard submarines.
   Members of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice plan to
join hundreds of other activists in a rally Oct. 8 outside the gates
of the Georgia submarine base.
   Coalition spokesman Bruce Gagnon said the activists will average
10 miles per day, stopping to distribute literature along the way.
   They are protesting both the Navy's Trident 2 program and NASA's
plans to launch a nuclear-powered spacecraft aboard the next space
shuttle.
   The spacecraft Galileo, waiting to be dispatched from Atlantis on
a six-year voyage to Jupiter, will get its power from two nuclear
generators containing 48 pounds of radioactive plutonium-238.
   The coalition has threatened to seek a court order and to
trespass on the launch pad if necessary to stop the flight, now set
for Oct. 12.
   NASA has released details of tests conducted on Galileo's radio
isotope thermoelectric generators. But the protest group is
skeptical of space agency claims that there is virtually no chance
of an explosion that would destroy the nuclear canisters and release
life-threatening radioactive fallout.

   Tens of thousands of Ukrainian Catholics on Sunday
joined in their church's biggest service since World War II to
demand that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government restore their legal
status and end decades of repression.
   The two-hour outdoor Mass in the Ukrainian city of Lvov came on
the 50th anniversary of dictator Josef Stalin's annexation of the
western Ukraine from Poland. Western witnesses said the Mass drew up
to 100,000 participants. A Ukrainian activist said 200,000 people
gathered at a later prayer session.
   At dusk, about 30,000 Ukrainians carrying candles ringed a
central square at Lvov's opera theater and observed a half-hour of
silence to commemorate victims of the 1939 Soviet takeover and the
purges that followed.
   Candles of mourning also twinkled in some apartment windows of
the city of 650,000 people.
   The action was designed to mirror Aug. 23 demonstrations in the
three Baltic republics in which more than 1 million Estonians,
Lithuanians and Latvians joined hands to protest the annexation of
their lands.
   The Baltics and the Western Ukraine both fell into the Soviet
orbit as a result of a secret pact between Stalin and Nazi German
Dictator Adolf Hitler.
   ``Tonight let us all turn off the electricity and put a candle in
the window to commemorate the millions who died under Stalinist
repression,'' Ukrainian Catholic activist Ivan Gel told the
worshipers in Lvov. ``Those candles will also symbolize the great
hopes we have for our one, our dear Ukraine.''
   ``The time has come for freedom for our church,'' declared Gel,
head of the Committee in Defense of the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   The Ukrainians carried at least 300 blue-and-yellow flags of
their once independent homeland, along with crosses, images of the
Virgin Mary and banners reading ``freedom for our church.''
   The outdoor service under an overcast sky was only the latest
sign of reviving nationalist consciousness in the Soviet Union's
second-most populous republic, where a new grassroots pro-democracy
group called Rukh held its founding congress last week.
   The Ukrainian Church, sometimes called the Uniate Church, has up
to 5 million members by some Western estimates, and is said to be
the largest banned religious organization in the world.
   In 1946, it was accused of widespread collaboration with the
Nazis and forced to merge with the Lvov synod of the Russian
Orthodox Church. The Ukrainian church's property was confiscated and
believers who refused to accept ``the reunion'' were brutally
repressed or driven underground.
   Despite greater official tolerance of religion since President
Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985, the Ukrainian church
is still officially banned. In May, about 200 church members
including Gel held a hunger strike on a Moscow street to demand
legal recognition for their faith.
   In a statement, hunger strikers charged authorities in the
western Ukraine with waging ``administrative terror'' against
Catholic priests and believers who petition Moscow for legalization.
They said some priests were being placed under administrative arrest
for up to 15 days.
   The church's fate has been a major obstacle to improved relations
between the Vatican and the Kremlin. In June, Pope John Paul II, in
a clear reference to Ukrainian believers, deplored state policies
that deny Eastern Rite Catholics the freedom of worship.
   The Ukrainians' status under Gorbachev's reforms is likely to be
a central issue at talks reportedy to be held between the pontiff
and the Soviet leader when they meet for the first time during a
November trip by Gorbachev to Italy.
   In Lvov, the worshipers walked three miles through the city's
medieval center to pray outside St. Yuri's cathedral, which
epitomizes the plight of their church. The sanctuary, once the seat
of Lvov's Catholic bishop, is now the cathedral of the local Russian
Orthodox prelate.
   Gel estimated the worshipers numbered 200,000 by the time they
reached St. Yuri's, a turnout he said was a triumph after more
decades of repression and official disapproval. ``This is a moral
victory,'' he said. ``Look how powerful our church is.''
   Soviet control of the western Ukraine began Sept. 17, 1939,
slightly more than two weeks after Hitler started World War II by
attacking Poland and less than a month after he and Stalin reached a
non-aggression agreement with a secret protocol dividing Eastern
Europe into spheres of influence.
   The Red Army moved into Poland along a broad front of what is now
the western Soviet republics of the Ukraine and Byelorussia. In
1940, Soviet tanks rolled into the Baltic republics.
   Armed bands held out against Soviet power in the forested hills
of the western Ukraine until almost a decade after the war's end in
1945.

   Police arrested 202 people early Sunday in an
attack on gang-related activity over the weekend that left at least
three people dead, including a 4-year-old boy.
   At least 72 people were arrested on felony charges involving
narcotics and other violations, said police detective Don Singer.
   Seven firearms and small quantities of cocaine, marijuana and a
hallucinogenic drug PCP were confiscated, Singer said.
   Despite the sweep, gang-related violence claimed at least three
lives and left 13 people wounded.
   In Garden Grove, south of Los Angeles, Frank Fernandez Jr., 4,
and Miguel Lorenzo Navarro, 18, were killed in a hail of gunfire
from a passing truck on Saturday, Police Lt. Ron Weigand said.
   Police believe one of the weapons used was a fully automatic
assault weapon and that Navarro was the target of the attack,
Weigand said.
   Elsewhere, an 18-year-old woman was killed when a gunman broke
into her Lennox apartment Saturday, officials said.
   Renee Johnson was shot and killed when a gang member kicked in
the door shortly after 3 a.m. and opened fire, sheriff's Detective
Harold Hladky said.

   Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin wrapped up an
eight-day tour of the United States on Sunday, and said he had found
Americans to be ``industrious, friendly, full of good humor and
vitality.''
   Yeltsin's first visit to the United States included meetings with
President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, meetings with NASA
officials, speaking engagements at colleges and a trip to an
American grocery store.
   Yeltsin, an outspoken critic of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
spoke Sunday to about 500 people at a $100-a-plate luncheon
sponsored by the University of Miami Graduate School of
International Studies.
   He said the political situation in the Soviet Union was
``extremely difficult'' and the Communist Party was ``on the verge
of crisis.''
   ``We have not seen an evolution of power from the party to the
congress,'' said Yeltsin, a member of parliament and former member
of the ruling Politburo.
   ``The party has got to be subordinate to the Congress of People's
Deputies. ... That's because the Politburo is leaning too far to the
right and pulling Gorbachev with it,'' he said through an
interpreter.
   While Yeltsin assailed the conservative elements in the Soviet
Union that were stalling reform, he assured, ``We are profoundly
convinced that glasnost and democratization of our society are
inevitable processes.''
   The luncheon was the last event scheduled for Yeltsin, who was to
leave Miami later Sunday en route to the Soviet Union.
   In Houston on Saturday, Yeltsin followed a meeting with NASA
officials about possible U.S.-Soviet space links with an eye-opening
visit to a grocery store, saying such plenty could cause a
revolution in his country.
   ``Even the Politburo doesn't have this choice,'' Yeltsin said, as
he looked over fish and meat at Randall's Supermarket in Clear Lake,
near the Johnson Space Center. ``Not even Mr. Gorbachev.''
   When he roamed the grocery store aisles, nodding his head in
amazement at the array of food and other products, Yeltsin commented
that if the Soviet people who stand in lines for groceries ever saw
a U.S. supermarket, ``there would be a revolution.''
   Yeltsin tasted free samples of cheese and produce and ogled rows
of meat. ``We don't have this much meat in the Soviet Union,'' he
said.
   He stopped several shoppers and workers, asking about the food
they selected and the cost.
   One store employee offered him a single yellow rose to remember
his trip to the Lone Star State and another gave him a bag of snacks.
   ``Is this what you give a starving Russian?'' Yeltsin joked.
``You should add some soap; we need that, too.''

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Defense Minister Says Rebels Are Disbanding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S.-backed rebel force fighting
Nicaragua's Sandinista government is disbanding but won't vanish all
at once, despite a Central American peace accord, the Nicaraguan
defense minister said Sunday.
   ``It won't be sudden, like an earthquake. They'll just dry up,''
Humberto Ortega told reporters in Mexico City.
   He said only 500 rebels, known as Contras, turned themselves in
under a repatriation program called for in last month's peace accord
signed in Tela, Honduras, by five Central American presidents.
   But he said the Contra force was crumbling through quiet
desertion.
   ``A lot of them don't trust us enough to turn themselves in.
They're just putting their guns away and waiting to see what
happens,'' said Ortega, who represented Nicaragua in Mexico's
Independence Day celebrations.
   The Central American presidents signed the agreement Aug. 7 that
called for dismantling the Contras, most of whom are based in
Honduras along the border with Nicaragua. In return, Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega promised democratic elections, now scheduled
for Feb. 25.
   Humberto Ortega said the opposition coalition's presidential
candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was allied with U.S.
interests.
   Mrs. Chamorro is the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, whose
assassination helped spark the Sandinista revolution that overthrew
President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979. She served on the first
post-revolutionary junta but resigned after a year and joined the
opposition that formed mainly because of the Sandinistas surge to
the left and its links with Cuba and the Soviet Union.
   Humberto Ortega said the Sandinista party will choose its
candidate on Sept. 24. He said he thought his brother, President
Daniel Ortega, would be the best nominee.
   Daniel Ortega's nomination is considered a virtual certainty.
   When asked what the army would do if Mrs. Chamorro and the
opposition wins, Humberto Ortega said the defense forces would not
try to control the government. But, he said, the Sandinista army
``will never be an army that serves a dominant class.''
   The Aug. 7 agreement calls for dismantling the Contras by Dec. 8,
but Humberto Ortega said their complete demobilization was unlikely.
He added if the Honduran base camps are shut the rebellion will
eventually die out.
   ``We've already reached a state of relative peace,'' he said.
``Once we hold elections we'll be able to reach a state of complete
peace.''
   The defense minister said about 60 people, including civilians,
soldiers and rebels, were killed in fighting in Nicaragua last month.
   He said there have been about 50 clashes a month between troops
and rebels, down from about 500 monthly before the United States cut
off military aid to the Contras in 1988. Non-lethal U.S. aid is
scheduled to continue through February.
   Humberto Ortega estimated the number of Contras in Nicaragua at
2,000 and the number in Honduran camps at 4,500, about one-quarter
the number Contra leaders claim.
   Journalists estimate there were more than 6,000 fighters in the
main Contra camp in Honduras last month, down sharply from more than
10,000 in February.

<TEXT>
   A bus carrying West German tourists
spending a week in the United States skidded off a highway on Sunday
and overturned, injuring 23 people, police said.
   There were no serious injuries among the 24 passengers on the
Bluebird Coach Lines bus, which apparently slid on wet pavement on
the New York State Thruway and rolled onto its side, said State
Police Lt. Timothy Howard.
   Howard said speed and a roadway made slick by two days of rain
contributed to the accident, but said police aren't sure what caused
the accident.
   Rescuers from the Bowmansville Fire Department said about half of
the passengers had already walked off the bus, but the rest had to
be freed by way of a 6-by-4-foot hole that rescue personnel cut
through the bus roof.
   The passengers from Wurzburg, West Germany, arrived in Toronto on
Friday night to begin their trip to Rochester, Wurzburg's sister
city in the United States, according to Rochester sister cities
program coordinator Otto Fuchs.
   Fuchs said the group visited Niagara Falls on Saturday and was
headed to Rochester when the accident occurred Sunday morning. The
group was also scheduled to make trips to Philadelphia, Washington,
D.C., and New York City before returning home Friday.
   Police did not know if the driver was among the injured, Howard
said.

<HEAD>Says North Korean Spy Escort Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A North Korean civilian, described by
Seoul authorities as a spy escort, defected to South Korea early
Sunday across the 2.5 mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, the Defense
Ministry announced.
   It said Suh Yong chul, a member of North Korea's ruling Workers'
(Communist) Party, surrendered at a South Korean marine outpost on
Kanghwa island at 3:45 a.m. after swimming across a river on the
western border.
   Ministry spokesman Kim Ji-wook identified Suh as an escort of
North Korean agents sent to South Korea for espionage. He gave no
further details.
   South Korea accuses North Korea of frequently sending spies
across the DMZ, established under the truce that ended the Korean
War in 1953.
   Suh was the seventh North Korean to defect to South Korea in less
than two months.
   In the latest incident on Sept.10 three North Koreans _ an army
second lieutenant, a staff sergeant and a civilian nurse _ crossed
through a minefield inside the DMZ and swam across a river on the
westen front.
   North Korea, in a report monitored in Tokyo Sunday, said the
United States sent a new ambassador, Donald Gregg, to South Korea to
help stop the anti-American movement.
   The official Workers Party newspaper Rodong Shinmun described
Gregg as ``an old `secret agent' who has accumulated experience in
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for nearly 30 years.''
   It said the ``U.S. imperialists have dispatched Gregg to South
Korea with a view to quelling the South Korean people's
anti-American sentiment for independence and reunification`` with
North Korea.
   Gregg arrived Saturday to take up his post in Seoul, where he
served as the U.S. CIA station chief in 1973-76.
   There have been increasing demands by some South Korean political
groups for withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Gregg said on arrival, ``As long as the Korean government and the
Korean public share with us the judgment that there is a need for
our presence, we will be here to assist in maintaining peace on the
peninsula.''
   The peninsula was divided at the end of World War II in 1945 into
the communist North and capitalist South. The United States was one
of 16 nations that sent troops to South Korea's aid after North
Korea invaded in 1950. American troops remained to help in defense
after the war ended in an armistice in 1953.

<TEXT>
   Two oil tankers collided off the northeast
coast of England early Sunday, caught fire and spilled more than
300,000 gallons of crude oil into the North Sea, the coast guard
said.
   No injuries were reported aboard the Liberian-registered Phillips
Oklahoma or the Maltese-registered Fiona, and authorities expressed
confidence the 20-mile-long by seven-mile-wide oil slick could be
dispersed.
   Six aircraft sprayed the spreading slick with dispersants
throughout the day. A coast guard spokesman said much of the oil had
broken into patches and there were no reports of oil coming ashore.
   The Fiona, which anchored when the early morning collision
occurred, was damaged in the bow while the Oklahoma, which was
moving, was damaged in the stern, said coast guard spokesman David
Clempson.
   He would not comment on who was responsible for the collision. He
said an investigation would be conducted by the Department of
Transport.
   Clempson said helicopters flew 20 firemen to the vessels, and
five fire-fighting tugs were at the scene. Five British minesweepers
on a NATO exercise were put on standby.
   Firefighters said it took more than three hours to contain the
flames aboard the Phillips Oklahoma, but the fire aboard the Fiona
was quickly controlled.
   By mid-morning, Clempson said, the Phillips Oklahoma fires had
been extinguished and the source of the oil leakage had been
stopped. Both ships were at anchor off Spurn Head in the Mouth of
the Humber, about 150 miles north of London, he said.
   The Phillips 66 Co., operators of the Phillips Oklahoma, said the
oil spilled from a slop tank through a hole two yards above the
waterline.
   ``Most of that will have probably been burnt up in the fire,''
Clempson said. ``The way it is heading it doesn't appear to be
coming ashore.''
   The Phillips Oklahoma carried 56,000 tons of crude oil, and the
Fiona had 46,500 tons of refined oil aboard, Clempson said.
   In London, a spokesman for the Department of Transport said
aerial surveys indicated the spill was minor.
   Seventeen of 26 crew members were evacuated from the Phillips
Oklahoma. One crew member from the Fiona was recovered from the sea
by the minesweeper HMS Middleton after he jumped overboard. He was
being treated for shock, and the rest of the ship's 30-member crew
remained aboard.

<HEAD>Remains Of Four Civil War Soldiers Reburied At Antietam Battlefield
Cemetery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEB RIECHMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SHARPSBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of four Union soldiers were
reburied at the Antietam National Battlefield on Sunday, the 127th
anniversary of an 1862 Civil War bloodbath.
   Relic seekers from Ohio discovered the remains of the front-line
soldiers in March 1988, and anthropologists and archaeologists have
been studying them since.
   On Sunday, the remains were sealed inside a plain, pine coffin
and buried with full military honors at Antietam National Cemetery.
   An estimated 450 people watched the Civil War funeral at the
11-acre hilltop cemetery near Sharpsburg, where the remains of
nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   The four soldiers found were members of the Irish Brigade from
New York, which charged the Confederate line Sept. 17, 1862, and
were killed by rifle fire.
   They were among more than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers
who were killed, wounded or missing after the Battle of Antietam,
which climaxed Gen. Robert E. Lee's two attempts to push the war
farther north. The battle is described as the single bloodiest day
of the war.
   ``The massive number of dead in the battle made the interment
paramount,'' said Dennis Frye, a historian with the National Park
Service. ``They did not have time to properly bury individuals with
independent memorial services.''
   Douglas Owsley, a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History, determined that two of the
fallen soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other
was about 45 years old. ``The older fellow had arthritis in his
shoulder bones,'' he said.
   ``This was a very unique opportunity because you have the ability
to associate with the men who went into battle,'' Owsley said.
``Normally, you have the artifacts without the bones.''
   About 85 men from re-enactment units representing the 28th
Massachusetts and the 93rd Pennsylvania regiments camped at Antietam
and assisted with the burial and a Roman Catholic Mass.
   The morning service was held along ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road
in the middle of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for
nearly four hours that day.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said Collin MacDonald, 38, of Centreville, Va., who
served as a commander for the event. ``This is the first Civil War
burial that the park has had this century. The re-enactors who are
here are making history.''
   A hazy ridge of South Mountain provided a distant backdrop for
the Mass. The coffin, which rested on sawhorses, was covered with a
34-star American flag. Some of the soldiers, dressed in navy coats
and light blue slacks, knelt on one knee during the service. Smoke
from morning campfires filled the air.
   Pallbearers placed the coffin on a horse-drawn cart drapped in
black, and the soldiers donned black arm bands before starting a
milelong procession from Bloody Lane to the cemetery. The group
marched to a somber beat of drums draped in black.

   Police killed 11 people Sunday during
fighting between members of rival Hindu castes in the southern state
of Tamil Nadu, authorities reported.
   They said those deaths raised to 20 the number of people killed
in two days of violence between the two groups.
   Police fired at mobs in three places in Madurai district of Tamil
Nadu, killing nine people, a police spokesman said.
   Two people were crushed to death under a police jeep that drove
into an attacking mob, said the spokesman, who was not identified
under police regulatins.
   Madurai district is 250 miles south of Madras, the state capital.
   Nine people were killed Saturday in armed fights in the district
between Brahmins and Harijans, two Hindu castes. Under the caste
system, Brahmins consider themselves superior to Harijans.
   Police said the clashes broke out when a Harijan leader made
speeches that Brahmins viewed as provocative. The leader, John
Pandiyan, has been arrested and charged with inciting communal
violence, the police said.

<TEXT>
   Moslem leaders and Lebanon's Christian
patriarch voiced support for a new Arab peace proposal Sunday, but
Christian army commander Michel Aoun rejected key parts of the plan
and fighting continued.
   Police said one person was killed and 14 were wounded in
nightlong artillery clashes in and around Beirut. That raised the
toll to at least 915 killed and 2,699 wounded since the latest
fighting broke out on March 8.
   Gen. Aoun rejected key clauses of the seven-point peace plan
announced Saturday by a three-member Arab League committee.
   In a televised interview, Aoun said he would not appoint a
representative to a Lebanese security committee that would oversee a
cease-fire under the peace plan.
   ``I won't accept at all a Lebanese-Lebanese committee. This is
what the Syrians wanted to deceive the world and say the clashes
have been among Lebanese factions,'' Aoun said.
   Syria has refused to take part in a security committee,
maintaining the conflict is between Aoun and his Lebanese foes. But
Syrian troops, in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate, allied with Moslem militias as a main party in the latest
violence.
   Aoun also criticized the committee's call for Parliament to meet
outside Lebanon to discuss political reforms demanded by the Moslems.
   ``First Lebanon should be free of all occupations, then reforms
could be worked out,'' he said. That was a reference to Syria and
Israel, which controls a border strip in south Lebanon.
   Aoun said he would abide by the cease-fire if Syria did. ``If
they don't put away their guns, we'll continue to respond to their
fire.''
   He renewed his attack on Washington, saying the U.S. government
was covering up for Syria. Washington withdrew its embassy staff
from Beirut on Sept. 6 after Christian demonstrators surrounded the
embassy compound demanding U.S. action to help drive the Syrians out.
   Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud Faisal, arrived
unexpectedly Sunday in the Syrian capital, Damascus, for talks with
Syrian leaders on putting the peace plan into effect.
   He delivered a letter to President Hafez Assad from King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia, according to officials who would not disclose its
contents. He then met with Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam,
architect of Syria's military intervention in Lebanon.
   Saud was to fly to Baghdad later Sunday for discussions in Iraq,
Syria's archrival and Aoun's weapons supplier.
   The Arab League committee comprising Fahd, King Hassan II of
Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria apppealed urgently
Saturday for an immediate cease-fire. Its several previous calls for
a truce have been ignored.
   Lebanon's acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem vying
for power with Aoun, welcomed Saturday's call. He called it ``a
chance to end the crisis that might not be repeated.''
   The plan does not call for Syria to withdraw its 40,000 troops,
whom Aoun charges have betrayed their mandate by siding with the
Moslems.
   The Arab League statement also said Algerian diplomat Lakhdar
al-Ibrahimi will head a security committee to supervise the
cease-fire and monitor ships to ensure no weapons reach the warring
factions.
   That will affect Aoun more than the Syrians. His only supply
route is by sea, as the enclave's three landward sides are ringed by
Syrian forces and their allies. Syria's supply lines run through
territory it controls.
   Fahd, Hassan and Bendjedid called on ``all parties'' to stop
arming the warring factions and said they have received ``positive
responses in this regard.''
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual leader of the Christian
Maronite sect, thanked the Arab League committee for ``the great
effort it is exerting to silence the guns.''
   Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri, one of Syria's main
allies in Lebanon, said he ``welcomes the security arrangements
included in the committee's plan, which are capable of halting the
cycle of violence.''
   Current fighting in the 14-year-old civil war erupted when Aoun
blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias and Syria responded
by besieging the 310-square-mile Christian heartland north of Beirut.
   The Arab League committee has invited Lebanon's 99 legislators to
meet Sept. 30 to ``discuss and prepare'' political reforms to end
the war that has killed more than 150,000 people.
   Maronites have dominated Lebanese politics since independence
from France in 1943, when Christians were considered the majority.
Now Moslems constitute about 55 percent of the country's 4 million
people and demand political equality.

   More than 2,000 Nicaraguan exiles greeted Nicaraguan
presidential candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on Sunday in her
first U.S. visit since being nominated as leader of the
anti-Sandinista factions.
   Mrs. Chamorro, wife of slain newspaper publisher Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, was mobbed by supporters when she arrived in Miami, a city
that received an influx of more than 100,000 impoverished Nicaraguan
refugees last year.
   She criticized the Sandinista government for human rights
violations and for causing the country's economic problems, and she
appealed to Nicaraguans abroad to consider returning to their
homeland if her opposition party is successful in the Feb. 25
elections.
   ``The hour has sounded for liberty in Nicaragua,'' she told the
crowd in Spanish. ``But the liberty is for Nicaraguans and the
reconciliation of all the people.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's visit came two days after the Bush administration
bowed to congressional pressure and abandoned a plan to funnel about
$2 million in government funds to her campaign through the
U.S.-financed National Endowment for Democracy.
   But administration officials say they will encourage private and
foreign groups to donate money to Mrs. Chamorro.
   The National Opposition Union, an anti-government coalition known
by its Spanish initials UNO, selected Mrs. Chamorro as its
presidential candidate earlier this month. The Sandinistas are
expected to endorse President Daniel Ortega for re-election.
   Mrs. Chamorro, 59, a Roman Catholic, pledged religious freedom
and said her administration would emphasize a free-market economy in
Nicaragua, one of the poorest nation's in the Western Hemisphere.
She also called on the United States to grant work permits to
Nicaraguan refugees.
   ``The communists are contrary to the history of Nicaragua and the
culture of the Nicaraguan people,'' said Mrs. Chamorro, who took
over the daily La Prensa newspaper after her husband was gunned down
in 1978.
   Mrs. Chamorro's detractors cite her political inexperience and
her brief term in the revolutionary government. A small band of
opponents who back other rebel leaders marched outside the
amphitheater Sunday.
   A $100-a-plate fund-raising dinner for Mrs. Chamorro was also
planned for Monday in Miami.
   Former Argentine President Raul Alfonsin and former President
Jimmy Carter are expected to head a commission to supervise and
observe the February elections.

   It took money to make money for a group of
investors who financed a treasure hunt that struck as much as $1
billion worth of gold off the South Carolina coast.
   The 106 investors in Recovery Limited Partnership, most from
central Ohio, had to show a net worth of at least $750,000 or income
over $200,000 per year for three years to be able sink money into
the search for the SS Central America, a paddle-wheel steamship that
sank 132 years ago.
   But for those who qualified and made an investment at least
$10,000 each, according to records filed in Ohio, the return
promises to be substantial if the group's right to ownership of the
gold is not overturned.
   The booty, which will take months to haul from 8,000 feet of
water nearly 200 miles out in the Atlantic, was three tons of
government gold from the San Francisco Mint plus fortunes that
passengers made during the California Gold Rush.
   The gold from the mint was being transported to New York via the
Isthmus of Panama when the Central America sank during a hurricane
Sept. 12, 1857. Of more than 575 people on board, only about 150
survived.
   Leaders of the expedition that located the wreck, the Columbus
America Discovery Group, called the find the largest American
treasure trove ever. Estimates of the cache's value range from
several hundred million dollars to $1 billion.
   ``We've found it. Gold. Lots of it. We have hit the mother
lode,'' underwater mining specialist Thomas Thomspon, a director of
the group, wrote in a letter to investment group members.
   Thompson put up no money for the expedition but is entitled to 40
percent of the income from it, according to filings with the Ohio
Division of Securities.
   ``It was a high risk from day one. (But) because of Tommy's
detailed studies and efforts over the years, I felt that it had a
fair success chance,'' said Donald C. Fanta, president of the Ohio
Co. brokerage and a member of the investment group.
   ``It is a tremendous technological achievement,'' Fanta said.
   A former research engineer at the Battelle Memorial Institute in
Columbus, Thompson took on an unpaid leave of absence to conduct the
search. He and others pinpointed the wreck's location by
cross-referencing news accounts of the day.
   The issue of who actually owns the gold is still not completely
settled, but an admiralty court in Norfolk, Va., has already ruled
the Columbus group owns the dozens of artifacts and trinkets
previously hauled from the steamship.
   ``At this point, the court has not considered the artifacts
recovered this month, that is to say the gold,'' said Rick Robol, a
lawyer for the group. ``The next step is a hearing on who is the
owner of the gold.''
   In another ruling favorable to the Columbus group, Judge Richard
B. Kellam last month made permanent an injuction prohibiting anyone
else from entering the wreck site. The admiralty court is a civil
court that rules on maritime law.
   Robol said from Dallas that he and his co-counsel, William J.
Kelly Jr. of Columbus, would request a hearing on ownership of the
gold, but said he did not know when he would make the request.
   `The usual procedure, he said, is to have the determination of
ownership on a number of different occasions as more and more items
are brought up from a wreck, Robol said.
   Judy Conrad, a historian who worked with the investors out of
their Columbus office, said the find is ``like a storybook
treasure.''
   Conrad wouldn't mind if workers in the office _ who are not
investors _ get to share a little of the wealth through a bonus of
some sort. ``We're just depending on the kindness of strangers,''
she said.

<HEAD>Three Killed in Alabama Plane Crash; Two in California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A small plane low on fuel crashed Sunday while trying to land on
a highway in Alabama, killing three men, and two people were killed
in California when their plane crashed between lanes of a freeway.
   A 6-year-old boy was the only survivor of the eastern Alabama
crash, said Houston County Deputy Sheriff Eddie Ingram.
   The boy was pulled from the plane after rescuers, carrying
buckets of water from a nearby river, doused flames that had
engulfed the aircraft. Truck drivers also stopped and used fire
extinguishers.
   Ingram said the rescuers lifted the aircraft by the tail section
and one man crawled beneath and pulled the boy out.
   ``If it hadn't been for them there's no doubt the child would
have perished,'' Ingram said. ``It was a heroic effort.''
   The pilot, Roger Kenneth Parmer, 47, informed flight controllers
about 3:30 p.m. that he was low on fuel and trying to reach a
landing strip at Cedar Springs, Ga.
   The plane struck a power line and crashed in a wooded area in
Gordon, Ala., near the Georgia state line, Ingram said.
   Also killed were Edward Prather, 55, and Kenneth S. Partridge,
54, all from LaGrange, Ga., said Houston County Coroner Robert Byrd.
   The boy, Brandon Parmer, was in guarded condition at Southeast
Alabama Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ray Griffith.
   In California, a man and woman were killed when their twin-engine
Cessna crashed between the northbound and southbound lanes of
Interstate 15 at Cajon Junction, about 55 miles northeast of Los
Angeles.
   Authorities were trying to determine the victims' identities.
   Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board were investigating where the
flight originated and where it was headed.
   Authorities learned of the accident through a telephone call from
a motorist, said San Bernardino County Sheriff's Sgt. David Lau.
When deputies arrived, they found the plane in flames and debris
scattered 100 yards away.

   The Butte, Mont., Public Housing Authority
failed to follow procedures in granting money for housing projects,
according to a recent audit by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Because of the shortcomings, HUD ``cannot be sure'' money awarded
for the projects was being spent ``in the most efficient and
economical way,'' said the audit report released Aug. 21.
   The Butte housing authority operates 356 low-income housing units
_ 214 for senior citizens and 142 for families. The assistance
program provides money to improve their physical condition and
upgrade their management. As of March 1989, $4.8 million had been
approved for the projects.
   The audit was conducted in April and May of this year.
   The housing authority made budget changes without following
written procedures, particularly concerning the addition to the
1986-87 budgets of $639,000 to remove lead-based paint and $100,000
to repair or demolish a building, the audit said. Because of those
changes, other items budgeted for those years, such as $251,000 for
water heaters and heating units, were postponed to 1988.
   HUD regulations call for submission of a formal budget revision
when a major change is made.
   The audit found that the Butte housing authority charged expenses
to the wrong accounts, didn't keep adequate accounting records,
didn't use available resources such as $17,000 worth of computer
equipment, requested money before spending what it already had and
failed to cancel invoices to ensure bills weren't paid more than
once.
   The audit also determined that the authority didn't follow HUD
requirements in awarding contracts. Among other discrepancies, the
authority failed to advertise or obtain HUD approval for contracts
over $10,000, as required.
   Butte did meet HUD requirements for developing and implementing a
five-year plan to meet the projects' physical needs but didn't
provide a rolling five-year plan, which would outline future
financial needs.
   The Inspector General's office instructed the Butte Public
Housing Authority to provide within 60 days a report on action taken
to remedy the problems or why action is not needed.

   The title is ``Carnage, A Comedy,'' as if authors
Adam Simon and Tim Robbins had to reassure theatergoers it was all
right to laugh.
   Not many did at a preview of this messy, meandering and mirthless
satire of religious evangelism that opened Sunday at the New York
Shakespeare Festival Public Theater.
   The play comes from The Actors' Gang, an acting ensemble from Los
Angeles that has been putting on productions since 1981 on the West
Coast and performed ``Carnage'' at the Edinburgh Festival in
Scotland before coming here. It wasn't worth the trip.
   Robbins, an actor best known for the movie ``Bull Durham,'' and
Simon have concocted an unfunny and heavy-handed comic strip
masquerading as a play. One of their main characters is a preacher
named Cotton Slocum, a rotund, shaggy-haired charlatan who sells
religion as if it were snake oil at a place called God's Happy Acre.
``This is not a non-profit organization,'' Slocum insists. ``This is
a church.''
   The minister and his carefully coiffured wife Tipper are always
in the market for new ways to make money. He devises a Prayer Walk
during which he will pound the pavement for the Lord as well as for
monetary pledges to finance his new religious theme park.
   Slocum's assistant is a right-wing zombie named Deacon Tack who
trains paramilitary cadets on the side. The man combines the fervor
of Ollie North and the personality of Bela Lugosi.
   Mixed into this fanatic folderol is a sweet, dim-witted housewife
named Dot who truly believes in Slocum and her husband Ralph, who
participates in Tack's military maneuvers. They all come together in
the desert during an incomprehensible second act. It deteriorates
into lunatic ravings, mostly by Tack about the upcoming Armageddon
in which the permissive society, as well as the Commies, will be
vanquished.
   The acting is more enthusiastic than competent, but Lee Arenberg
is fine as the money-hungry minister, Shannon Holt projects the
simple sincerity of the deluded housewife, and Ned Bellamy is
positively creepy as the looney deacon.
   But a smirkiness and condescension pervade the proceedings.
What's more, the play can't compete with the real thing. Jim and
Tammy Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart, Ollie North and all the rest of the
people ``Carnage'' attempts to harpoon are much more theatrical _
and funnier _ in real life than anything Simon and Robbins have put
on stage.

   The Navy is standing by its conclusion that
a USS Iowa crewman probably deliberately caused a blast aboard the
battleship that killed 47 men, despite a report that the battleship
was being used for high-explosive experiments.
   Transcripts from the Navy investigation of the April 19 blast
showed that an improper type of gun powder was being used
experimentally when the explosion occurred inside the ship's No.2
turret, which has three 16-inch guns, Media General News Service
reported Sunday.
   ``Everything was very carefully considered,'' said Cmdr. Mark
Baker, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, who defended the Navy's
official report on the explosion.
   The Pentagon report said circumstantial evidence indicated
gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig of Cleveland intentionally sparked the
explosion. However, the report said it would be impossible to prove
because all those nearby died in the explosion, including Hartwig.
   But the detailed transcripts showed that the Navy command that
requested the experiments _ the Naval Sea Systems Command _ was the
same agency that performed the tests that led to the Navy's
conclusion about the cause of the explosion, released earlier this
month.
   Hartwig's family has requested a congressional investigation.
   U.S. Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, who has consulted with the
Hartwig family, said Sunday she will hold a meeting in her
Washington office with Navy investigators on Monday to question them
about the Iowa report.
   ``We're concerned about the safety of the individuals aboard any
of these battleships,'' she said. ``We've known for some time now
there were some questions about that gunpowder ... It certainly
appears they didn't continue their own investigation. Everything
leads to asking them why they didn't conclude that some of it was
their fault.''
   The 7,007 pages of transcripts of Navy investigators and
interviewees was made available to the public, but only at the
Pentagon and only for one day, the day the official report was
issued.
   The transcripts showed Iowa gunners were firing an experimental
load from the No. 2 turret with high-strength powder not approved
for the weight of the projectile. According to the transcripts, the
tests were designed to improve the accuracy and range of the ship's
antiquated 16-inch guns.
   The experiments involved the use of a bagged powder, called Delta
846, with 2,700-pound projectiles. That was in violation of warnings
written in large letters on each container of D-846 powder bags that
said not to use it with the heavier projectiles because it would
create too much pressure and heat inside the gun barrel.
   Apparently to avoid that, the ship's gunners were using five
110-pound bags of the powder instead of the normal six-bag charge.
   The battleship's commander, Capt. Fred B. Moosally, told
investigators that he did not know a five-bag charge was going to be
used in the No. 2 turret.
   Master Chief S.P. Skelly, who had won a reputation throughout the
service as a ballistics expert, was in charge of the experiments.
   Moosally said Skelly did not brief him on any of the experiments.
   ``A lot of these things that I'm hearing about, it seems to me
they rightfully belong somewhere other than at sea, at least until
they're approved through all the shore testing and directed to be
conducted at sea,'' Moosally said.
   The investigators pursued the possibility that Hartwig, who took
over as gun captain in a last-minute roster change, perhaps was
confused by seeing only five bags of powder delivered at the breech
instead of six, and that in the confusion the powder bags were
rammed into the barrel too quickly, splitting a bag open and
igniting the powder by the heat of friction.
   The friction theory was eliminated by a series of tests under the
direction of the Naval Sea Systems Command at the Naval Surface
Warfare Center at Dahlgren, Va., the same command that encouraged
the experiments with the D-846 powder aboard the Iowa.
   But those findings contradicted all previous Navy literature
warning of ignition of powder bags by friction.
   Tests at Dahlgren and other Navy sites found that trace elements
present in the breech of the center gun of the No. 2 turret could
not be found after firings with normal powder. Those elements were
found, however, when a timing device and battery were inserted
between the powder bags and the gun was fired.
   The Navy has suggested that Hartwig could have inserted a timer
into the powder charge.
   However, the investigation transcripts showed that the breech of
the center gun was open at the time of the explosion, and those
trace elements could have been blown into the breech by the fireball
that swept through the turret.

   Television stars who usually shine at
night came out for Sunday's annual Emmy Awards extravaganza in their
glitziest garb while the sun shone brightly on a California
afternoon.
   ``It's too bad,'' said perpetual fashion gadfly Mr. Blackwell.
``If it was nighttime you couldn't see the dresses as well. They
would look better.''
   The glamorous women who adorn such TV hits as ``L.A. Law,''
``Golden Girls'' and ``Murder She Wrote,'' chose either tailored
elegance or shimmering sequins in a rerun of Emmys past.
   Others came in everything from miniskirts to pants and one couple
wore African costumes.
   The head turner of the outdoor arrivals was Jean Kasem, wife of
Casey Kasem, whose outfit featured 25 pounds of metal.
   The creation, which she said was titled ``metal mass,'' was
created for her by Anthony Ferrara. It was topped off with a black
helmet with rows of beads falling below her chin.
   ``At least Jean knows what being a star is all about,'' said
Blackwell who turned thumbs down on most of the star dressing.
   ``There's too much cheap glitz,'' said Richard Blackwell, who
compiles an annual worst-dressed list said. ``There's nothing new.
No one can figure out what a fashion statement is. This is probably
one of the most eclectic masses of yesterday.''
   The fans who gathered across the street from the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium for the ceremonies appeared to share Blackwell's ho hum
attitude. They barely screamed at all when the stars stepped from
their limousines.
   In the middle of the fan gallery, protesters from a religious
group carried placards reading, ``TV idols and idolaters, repent!''
   Perhaps the most unique outfit was worn by a costume designer,
Paula Glock, who embellished her black minisuit with brass knives,
forks and spoons displayed down the front. She called the outfit,
``Dinner For Two.''
   In the crowd of fans, some of the warmest applause was reserved
for such youth-oriented shows as ``The Wonder Years'' and ``Growing
Pains'' as well as the stars of ``Golden Girls,'' a show aimed at an
older audience.
   The ``Golden Girls'' _ Estelle Getty, Bea Arthur, Betty White and
Rue McClanahan _ were tastefully glamorous in a range of sequins and
satins.
   Angela Lansbury of ``Murder, She Wrote'' showed up in a feminine
version of a male tuxedo, an outfit Blackwell dubbed as passe.
   ``I think the pants scene is over,'' he said. ``But I think she
looked elegant _ from the hips up.''
   The standout, according to Blackwell, was Debbie Allen who wore a
dress with billowing black sleeves and a gold sash.
   Susan Ruttan of ``L.A. Law'' wore a tight brocade minidress
fashioned with a net pouf around the neck.
   Asked who designed her dress, she said, ``I did!''
   Said Blackwell: ``It looks like it.''

<HEAD>Military Analysts Say Soviet Changes Unpredictable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Changes in the Soviet bloc are developing so
fast it is impossible to tell were they will lead, military
specialists from the East and West blocs said at the end Sunday of a
three-day conference.
   Military analysts from Warsaw Pact nations were invited for the
first time in 20 years to address the annual conference of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies _ IISS.
   ``The general feeling was that the Soviets want reform at least
as much as they want order,'' Francois Heisbourg, director of the
London-based private institute, said in an interview.
   But continued disorder might spark the violent breakup of the
Soviet Union, Heisbourg said, citing opinions expressed among those
present.
   The 381 private and government military analysts discussed, among
other issues, the consequences of Soviet reform and negotiations
between the superpowers. Heisbourg said it was institute policy not
to disclose details of the closed-door debate.
   ``There is currently an atmosphere of detente,'' said Heisbourg,
a former defense advisor to the French government. Talks between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact on
conventional arms parity in Europe were promising, he said.
   Opinions ranged from ``very pessimistic to moderately
optimistic'' among the specialists from 17 nations on Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chances for completing his economic
and political reforms, he said.
   The situation shifts so quickly that some authors said their own
papers, written two months ago, were already out of date.
   ``It is in everyone's interest for reforms to succeed,''
Heisbourg said. ``The bottom line is that it will be difficult and
take a long time.''
   East bloc delegates ``acknowledged grave problems in the Soviet
Union'' such as the ethnic strife in provinces wanting a stronger
national identity, Heisbourg said.
   ``Nationalism and populism are symptoms of ailments ... but
Gorbachev is in charge. There is no coherent opposition to challenge
him.''
   The independent institute, which was founded in 1958 and has
about 3,000 members from 76 countries, studies strategic issues.

<TEXT>
   Businesses could help improve the South's
infant mortality and low birth rate statistics by educating pregnant
employees in prenatal care, Southern governors were told Sunday.
   ``The South continues to lag behind the nation'' with an infant
mortality rate of 12.0 per 1,000 live births, compared with a
national rate of 10.0, according to Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton,
chairman of the Southern Corporate Coalition to Improve Maternal and
Child Health.
   Joe Taylor, plant manager for Sunbeam Appliance Co. in Coushatta,
La., described his company's mandatory prenatal education program
that began in 1986 after statistics for the previous two years
showed 11 employees had premature babies that cost the company $2
million in medical care.
   The prenatal education program costs the company $10,000 per
year, and in 1987, Taylor said there were no premature babies born
to employees. In 1988, he said there was one premature baby that was
hospitalized for only nine weeks.
   ``We've saved a great deal of money,'' he said, noting that
before the classes, the company was spending about $25,000 in health
care costs per premature baby. Now the costs per birth are about
$3,500.
   Conferees at the Southern Governors' Association annual meeting
shared ideas on how businesses could help keep babies alive past
their first year.
   The association represents 17 states and two territories.
   Clinton said Southern states are reducing infant mortality rates,
but low birth weight rates remain high, although figures were not
available. Low birth weight babies are those born weighing 5 pounds
or less.
   ``I'll bet you the low birth rate is high because employees don't
have the education. I think it's because we haven't reached this
employee population like we should,'' he said.
   Clinton said he hopes to call a conference in Arkansas late this
year or in early 1990 to address the problems with business leaders
and health care providers.

   Nine guerrillas thought to be Kurdish
rebels were killed by security forces in this township near the
Iraqi and Syrian borders Sunday, the regional governor's office said.
   The announcement, carried by the semi-official Anatolia news
agency, said the battle took place near the village of Derebasi.
   Security forces seized automatic guns, ammunition, a rocket
launcher and outlawed publications after the gun fight, the agency
said.
   It did not say what organization the guerrillas were believed to
belong to. Most insurgents operating in the region are linked to the
outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, a Marxist group that has been battling
the government since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
eastern Turkey.
   An estimated 1,000 people have been killed in the fighting.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ National leader Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril on Sunday promised democratic reforms and economic progress in
a speech marking the first anniversary of the coup that put him in
power.
   In the address broadcast on the state-run media from the National
Palace, Avril said, ``Our quest is to promote the human, economic,
social, and political rights of Haitians.''
   He asked the international community to back efforts to return
this impoverished Caribbean nation to civilian rule.
   On Sept. 17, 1988, rank-and-file soldiers outraged by what they
called state-sponsored violence ousted former military ruler Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy in a bloodless coup. They chose Avril to head a
new government.
   The soldiers, mostly of the Presidential Guard, also demanded a
return to democratic rule and a respect for human rights.
   Some Haitians are skeptical that Avril will do what he has
promised.
   ``Hope has been reborn in an eventual solution to our problems,
even if the relief which Haitians felt at the overthrow of Namphy
has not developed into confidence in Avril,'' said Leopold
Berlanger, director of the Haitian Research and Development
Institute.
   In March, Avril partially restored the 1987 Constitution that
Namphy had suspended in July 1988. Avril has pledged to turn over
power to an elected government and allowed the creation of an
independent Electoral Council.
   That council is expected to announce later this month a date for
elections.
   The U.S. government granted $10 million in surplus wheat to Haiti
in June.
   Washington resumed direct government aid suspended after aborted
elections of 1987, when thugs protected by soldiers killed at least
34 voters at polling stations.
   Hundreds of allegedly corrupt soldiers and officers have been
discharged from the army since Avril took power.
   On Dec. 14 his government signed five international human-rights
conventions. However, human rights groups charge that abuses, often
perpetrated by soldiers, are still common.
   Haiti has been govered by military-dominated governments since
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country during violent
demonstrations that ended about three decades of Duvalier family
rule. He now lives in exile in France.

   Graduates of the Bad Check Writer's School
probably won't be hanging their diplomas on the wall, but
authorities hope next time they put pen to paper the results will at
least be legal.
   The school, held at various locations on weekends, is the last
step in a pilot program designed to keep misdemeanor offenders from
clogging the courts.
   Those who have written bad checks under $200 must reimburse their
creditors, pay a $65 fine and spend four hours in class learning
ethics and how to balance their checkbooks.
   ``It's dumb mistakes that brings most of us here today,'' student
Larry Logsdon, 35, said at a recent session. ``I know I've been
kicking myself ever since.''
   Logsdon, a vitamin salesman from Glendora, wrote a bad check to a
supermarket for $75.
   ``I thought I had enough money,'' he said.
   Since 1986, the program has returned $1.2 million to merchants.
It is expected to double in size next month, said Capt. Edmund M.
Aleks, who heads the program for the district attorney's special
operation division.
   To date, more than 5,000 people have been graduated from the Bad
Check Writer's School. To earn their diplomas, the students must
know how to balance a bank statement and a checkbook.

   An empty Exxon oil tanker that lost power in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca was repaired Sunday and sailed for Alaska,
the Coast Guard said.
   The tanker lost power Friday night about 33 miles west of Port
Angeles.
   The ship drifted for about an hour in the strait before regaining
some maneuverability and was escorted by the Coast Guard to Port
Angeles.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Richard Fitzpatrick said a malfunction in
the electronic components of the 810-foot Exxon San Francisco was
repaired in Port Angeles and the ship headed for Valdez, Alaska.
   The Strait of Juan de Fuca separates the Olympic Peninsula in
Washington State from Canada's Vancouver Island and links Puget
Sound with the Pacific Ocean. Tankers, many carrying Alaska crude
oil, travel the strait regularly to reach refineries along Puget
Sound.

   The last two of 10 coal miners killed in a
western Kentucky mine explosion were buried Sunday, and residents
said the tragedy soon will be forgotten because such disasters are
common in coal country.
   Funeral services were held for Anthony T. McElroy, 36, of
Providence, and Curtis W. Scott, 47, of Madisonville.
   Seven victims of Wednesday's blast at Pyro Mining Co.'s William
Station Mine in Wheatcroft, which company officials speculate was
fueled by methane gas, were buried Saturday. The other victim was
buried Friday.
   The accident ``will call everybody's attention for a while, but
six months from now they'll forget about it,'' said former coal
miner John Clark of Wheatcroft.
   Clark and a truck driver who hauls coal said mining accidents are
nothing new because running coal is dangerous, especially
underground.
   Meanwhile, the investigation into the accident _ the nation's
worst mine disaster since 1984 _ was delayed for a third consecutive
day Sunday because of dangerous levels of methane gas at the
underground facility, said federal Mine Safety and Health
Administration spokesman Frank O'Gorman.
   MSHA has approved a plan, with modications, which Pyro submitted
to rectify the problem, O'Gorman said. ``The investigation has not
officially started,'' he said.
   O'Gorman said he did not know when the methane problem would be
cleared.

Message</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Roe vs. Wade,'' probably the most
controversial show of the past television season, lived up to its
outspoken reputation in winning two top Emmys at the 41st Annual
Primetime Emmy Awards show.
   Holly Hunter, who won the Emmy for best actress in a miniseries
or special for her starring role in the NBC movie, said in her
acceptance speech that the movie made a case for a woman's right to
abortion.
   Hunter, in thanking Norma McCorvey, whose fight for a legal
abortion led to the historic 1973 Supreme Court decision, said she
``continued to fight to keep women from being second-class citizens
and for refusing to give up her right to reproductive choice.''
   ``Roe vs. Wade,'' which also shared the outstanding drama-comedy
special Emmy with ``Day One,'' was subject to more than 20 rewrites
because NBC was concerned that the movie would come out in favor of
a woman's right to abortion.
   The movie was abandoned by advertisers and targeted by
fundamentalist Christian groups, who claimed the movie was biased.
   Speaking backstage after collecting her statute, Hunter, an
activist in the abortion rights movement, said the movie did indeed
have a point of view.
   ``It can't be right down the middle,'' she said. ``The story was
a woman fighting for a pro-choice right.''
   Michael Manheim, the executive producer of ``Roe vs. Wade,'' said
the movie took four years to bring to the screen.
   Said Hunter: ``I'd like to thank NBC for getting this movie on
the air.''

   Without moonwalking much or doing new pitching
for Pepsi, pop star Michael Jackson will make an estimated $65
million in 1989 to remain the world's highest-paid entertainer,
according to Forbes magazine.
   Aging rock groups who were in their prime 20 years ago banked on
reunion tours and a nostalgia wave to join Forbes' list of 40
richest entertainers, while some list perennials slipped a bit or
dropped off entirely.
   Jackson made $125 million in 1988-89 to edge movie maker Steven
Spielberg, who made an estimated $64 million this year for a
two-year total of $105 million.
   Forbes, which is publishing the list in its Oct. 2 issue, said
Spielberg is getting a big boost from the videocassette release last
year of his blockbuster film ``E.T. _ The Extraterrestrial.''
   Dropping from second to third on the list was Bill Cosby, the
comedian turned television star and author who amassed some $60
million this year and $95 million in 1988-89, according to Forbes'
calculations.
   Jackson, 31, who gained national attention at age 5 in the Motown
family combo The Jackson Five, has made only two albums in the last
seven years _ ``Thriller'' in 1982 and ``Bad'' in 1987 _ but reaps
millions from sales and endorsements.
   The androgynous singer announced after ending his ``Bad'' tour in
January that he would not perform on stage anymore.
   Forbes said Jackson's last two records have brought in $100
million; three videocassettes since 1983 sold over 2 million copies;
the Beatles music catalog he bought in 1985 makes him $3 million
annually; and his autobiography, ``Moonwalk,'' has sold some 425,000
copies.
   Jackson also has a $9 million endorsement deal with Pepsi _
although he made no new commercials for Pepsi in 1989 _ and last
week signed a deal worth a reported $20 million with shoe and
sportswear manufacturer L.A. Gear.
   Each of the top three easily outpaced earnings for the best-paid
American corporate executives. Michael D. Eisner, head of Walt
Disney Productions, made $40 million last year, followed by Steven
J. Ross of Warner Communications Inc., who had about $14.16 million,
and Richard L. Gelb of Bristol-Myers Co. with $14.14 million,
according to Forbes.
   The rest of the top 10 entertainers and their combined 1988-89
earnings were:
   _Mike Tyson, boxer, $71 million.
   _Charles M. Schulz, cartoonist, $60 million.
   _Eddie Murphy, comedian, actor, $57 million.
   _Pink Floyd, rock group, $56 million.
   _The Rolling Stones, rock group, $55 million.
   _Oprah Winfrey, talk-show host, $55 million.
   _George Michael, pop singer, $47 million.
   Resurgent performers who either began performing or peaked in
popularity in the 1960s and '70s _ The Rolling Stones, The Who,
Aerosmith, The Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd _ all either debuted or
rose higher on the list.
   Now in their 27th year, the five durable Stones recently began a
nationwide tour to promote a new album. Psychedelic rockers Pink
Floyd don't need an education in money-making: they jumped to No. 7
from No. 19 thanks to a tour.
   Unranked two years ago, the Los Angeles heavy metal group Guns N'
Roses made $24 million in 1988 and 1989, ``selling millions of
records with their winning combination of racism, sexism and
all-around smut,'' Forbes said.
   Overall, the music industry led the list with 19 acts. The film
industry had 11 names on the list, including new entries actors Mel
Gibson and Bill Murray. There were only three women on the list,
down from five last year: Winfrey, singer-actress Madonna and
actress-exercise guru Jane Fonda.
   Among those vanishing from the list: singers Tina Turner, Sting
and Wayne Newton; actors Paul Hogan and Bruce Willis; and boxer
Michael Spinks.
   Forbes said it calculated the entertainers' earnings based on
their pre-tax profits, as estimated by the magazine.

<HEAD>Whittle Says Channel One Ad Sales Halfway Toward First-Year Goal</HEAD>
<HEAD>For release at 6 p.m. EDT; Time set by source.</HEAD>

   The architects of the Channel One news show for
schools say they have signed contracts that put them more than
halfway toward their first-year goal of raising $90 million from
advertising on the program.
   Some Channel One critics expected the controversy that erupted
over a program that enables companies pitch products in the
classroom would scare off advertisers.
   But Christopher Whittle, chairman of the Knoxville, Tenn.-based
media concern that created Channel One, said in an interview that
``some people have overestimated that issue.''
   The daily Channel One television shows are scheduled to begin
next March, and Whittle Communications has been lining up sponsors
for the past three months.
   Several national education groups and state education officials
in New York and California have vehemently opposed Channel One, and
some cable networks have begun offering ad-free alternatives for use
in schools, notably a 15-minute daily news show carried on Turner
Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network.
   Whittle said Friday that advertisers want to buy time on the
12-minute news shows not only because it gives them access to an
often hard-to-reach audience of young teens, but to help schools.
   Revenue from the two minutes of ads on each Channel One show will
be used to pay the costs of producing the daily news program,
providing two companion educational network services and equipping
each participating school with dozens of television sets, a
satellite dish and two videocassette recorders.
   Whittle said five companies have signed ``firm, non-cancellable,
multiyear contracts'' that will generate $51 million in ad revenue
during the first year of Channel One programming _ or 56 percent of
the first-year goal of $90 million.
   He said those commitments indicate Channel One's revenue will
exceed that of any cable TV network during its first year in
business.
   Including the first year's revenue, the contracts would generate
$149.7 million in ad revenue over the first four years of Channel
One, he said.
   Whittle declined to identify any sponsors, but said they included
four who had been in a seven-week test of the Channel One service in
six schools last spring as well as one newcomer.
   None of several of the Channel One test sponsors questioned
Friday indicated whether they would advertise on it next spring.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which advertised two brands of shampoo,
potato chips, deodorant and acne medication in the Channel One test,
is ``still evaluating the program,'' said spokeswoman Kelly
Gillespie at the consumer product giant's Cincinnati headquarters.
   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the jeans maker from San Francisco, and Wm.
Wrigley Jr. Co., the gum maker from Chicago, have made no final
decisions, spokesmen said.
   Hans Fiuczynski, a spokesman for M&amp;M-Mars in Hackettstown, N.J.,
said, ``We do not discuss our future plans'' with the media. The
company pitched M&amp;Ms and Snickers candy during the Channel One test.
   The Channel One producers are giving advertisers a chance to be
the exclusive sponsor in 15 different product categories starting
next spring.
   Whittle said the five companies already signed have locked up
eight of those product categories. The value of the multiyear
contracts, which run either three or four years, ranged from $13
million to $53 million, he said.
   Whittle took several steps this summer to indicate that it is
making progress toward getting Channel One in operation.
   It signed a $150 million contract with Philips Consumer
Electronics Co., based in Knoxville, Tenn., to make, install and
maintain the video system in the schools. It named a panel of 12
luminaries led by former Education Secretary Terrell Bell to advise
the Channel One programmers.
   Earlier this month, Whittle began an intensive effort toward
signing up schools for the program.
   Whittle declined to say how many schools have signed up, but said
he is confident that the targets of 1,000 schools at launch and
8,000 by December 1990 will be reached.

<HEAD>Children's Products Market Takes Off With Baby Boom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The convention hall may be full of playpens and
cribs, pacifiers and cradles, but there is little child's play at
the 20th annual Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association trade
show _ where companies come for show-and-tell in the $1.95 billion
market in wares for the under-3 gang.
   There are even products that help combat yuppie guilt for being
at work instead of at home with the kids.
   Now that baby boomers are having babies themselves the market has
taken off, spurred by the higher salaries of professional,
two-career families who wait until later in life to have children.
   Also, fewer children per family means more money per child,
association members said.
   Tastes also have changed, with price often being of little
object, said Shirley Pepys, the trade group's vice president and
head of her own firm, which makes coordinated nursery bedding and
other infant products.
   For example, her Noel-Joanna Inc., which markets products under
the NoJo brand, last year introduced a Battenberg lace crib
ensemble, complete with elegant canopy. The price: about $600.
   ``We just did it for fun,'' Mrs. Pepys said. ``It's turned into
one of our best sellers.''
   Such extravagance doesn't last long. ``While they'll spend $600
on the crib bedding, which they'll use for two years, they balk at
spending $100 for a comforter for a bunk bed. At (age) 2,
practicality takes over.''
   Before then, however, parents will shell out the bucks.
   Frances Blakey, the association's director of public relations,
said studies indicate parents spend $30,000 on a child up until age
5, about 30 percent of all they'll spend before the child reaches 18.
   And there are so many ways to spend it.
   Playskool Baby Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of toymaker Hasbro
Inc., has a three-sided toothbrush among its abundance of infant
care products _ many adorned with Mickey Mouse and Kermit the Frog _
to pitch during the show this weekend at the Dallas Apparel Mart.
   Playskool is one of the large players in the industry,
manufacturing about six pieces of product for every birth in the
country last year, said President Bob Stebenne.
   But Mrs. Pepys said only about 20 of the 250 or so companies at
the show have annual sales of $20 million or more. Most of the firms
would be considered small businesses, she said.
   Many of the companies were begun by parents who developed a
product to meet their own needs, and then recognized a wider
potential, Mrs. Pepys said.
   One such firm is Decorate It! Inc., whose president, Angel
Martinez, said the company's wall decorating product was created
``out of pure need,'' specifically to avoid lengthy redecorating of
yet another room.''
   The system consists of a border and appliques with an adhesive
that allows them to be pulled off and reapplied ``more frequently
that anyone would every want to do it,'' said Martinez, who is also
a vice president of athletic shoemaker Reebok International Ltd.
   Also, joked Martinez, kids and parents can do the redecorating
together, ``a way to alleviate yuppie guilt'' over not spending
enough time with the children.
   Safety also has become a big issue in the industry. Cribs, for
example, no longer have finial posts or other sharp edges but are an
array of curves and rounded edges to prevent accidental cuts.
   Even bedding has been affected, Mrs. Pepys said, noting that
manufacturers have to be aware of the length of ties on crib bumper
pads to prevent accidental strangulation.
   The association has begun a certification program and hopes to
make consumers more aware of which products have been given a JPMA
seal of approval.

<HEAD>Report: Japan, U.S. Planning Joint Work on New Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States have agreed to start
joint development of applications for the so-called fifth-generation
computer, a Japanese newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun said the cooperation will begin with the
exhibition of Japan's Multi-Personal Sequential Inference (PSI)
system at a Japan-U.S. symposium on artificial intelligence
scheduled for Oct. 11-13 in Argonne, Ill.
   The new system, a prototype fifth-generation, or artificial
intelligence, computer built in November 1988, is the only one of
its kind, said Yomiuri, Japan's largest circulation newspaper.
   The move is aimed at reducing friction between the two countries
over advanced technology, it said, quoting unidentified sources at
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   At the symposium at the Argonne National Laboratory, the two
governments would begin using the new Japanese system in specific
research tasks under a U.S. research program, it said.
   Government officials could not be reached for comment Sunday.
   After the vacuum-tube computer, the transistorized computer and
the integrated circuit computer, the fourth generation computer
includes supercomputers with very large-scale integration circuits.
   The immense calculating power of supercomputers is used for such
tasks as helping meteorologists to predict weather, oilmen to draw
up intricate geological maps and chemists to test molecular
combinations in the search for new drugs.
   The fifth generation of computer, with very, very large-scale
integration circuits, is envisioned as comprehending the spoken and
written word, perfecting language-translation systems, and extending
databases to ``knowledge bases,'' a more complex system endowing
computers with common-sense attributes.
   In fifth-generation computer science, Yomiuri said, Japan is
considered ``far ahead'' of the United States, France, Britain, West
Germany and others in hardware. All are developing this science
under government projects.
   Leading the research in Japan is the Institute for New Generation
Computer Technology, a think tank of more than 70 researchers
established in 1982 under MITI's guidance.
   The equivalent of more than $1 billion in Japanese government and
corporate funds is going into the effort.
   MITI decided to let U.S. National Science Foundation jointly
sponsor the exhibition of the PSI system after U.S. scientists
expressed interest in using the computer in genetic engineering,
Yomiuri said.
   U.S. researchers, said to be ahead of their Japanese counterparts
in genetic engineering, are interested in using the PSI computer
because of its superior inferential ability, it said.
   Yomiuri quoted anonymous MITI officials as saying Japanese
scientists also could learn new genetic engineering techniques in
the joint project.

   Union employees at a Chrysler Corp. assembly
plant voted overwhelmingly to approve a three-year contract that was
reached hours before a strike deadline earlier in the week.
   A union spokesman said Saturday's vote was more than 90 percent
in favor of the three-year agreement, which affects about 3,800 of
the 4,400 workers at Chrysler's No. 1 plant in suburban St. Louis.
   The union said a major gain in the agreement is a provision for
relief for plant workers during heat waves. Complaints about what
workers called ``unbearable'' heat inside the plant prompted wildcat
walkouts in the past.
   Economic issues, such as wages and fringe benefits, are covered
in the national contract that expires in September 1990.
   Although details of the contract were not released, Local 136
President Ed Boyer said it contained provisions for more heat breaks
and more ice and water when heat becomes a problem inside the plant.
   The plant manufactures Dodge Daytona sports cars and Chrysler
LeBaron sports coupes and convertibles.

<DATELINE>READING, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Meridian Bancorp Inc. said it will raise its
estimated $704 million bid for First Pennsylvania Corp. to beat an
offer made by CoreStates Financial Corp.
   ``We'll submit a higher bid; that will be in the near future,''
Meridian spokeswoman Doris Piasecki said Saturday. The Reading-based
bank holding company made its original offer for First Pennsylvania
in August.
   After the stock market closed Friday, CoreStates proposed a
stock-swap merger worth about $18.50 per common share for the
Philadelphia-based banking company, Piasecki said. The offer expires
at noon Monday, according to a news release from Meridian.
   First Pennsylvania's stock closed down 25 cents at $15.25 Friday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   William Wolf, a spokesman for Philadelphia-based CoreStates, did
not return telephone messages left at his home over the weekend.
   First Pennsylvania had given Meridian until 5 p.m. Saturday to
respond to CoreStates' offer. Piasecki said management for the
company did not formally meet, but decided to raise its offer.
   She did not say when the offer will be made.
   Meridian said CoreStates requested a lock-up warrant, which would
be intended to thwart a hostile takeover by another party.

<TEXT>
   A proposed merger between the
Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV, the Netherland's second-largest bank,
and Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, has been called off,
media reports indicated Sunday.
   Both the Belgian national news agency, Belga, and the Rotterdam
newspaper Algemeen Dagblad said plans for the merger had been
shelved.
   According to the Belga report, negotiations between the two banks
ran into problems over legal, tax, and ``cultural'' differences.
   Spokesmen from Generale de Banque and Amro were not available for
comment. The two banks on Friday called a joint press conference for
Monday in Amsterdam.
   Neither press report cited its sources. But the Algemeen Dagblad
said Amro unions and worker councils were informed over the weekend
that the merger was off.
   The Belga report quoted ``several observers'' as saying that the
proposed merger had run into opposition from Compagnie Financiere de
Suez SA of France, which, through its majority stake in holding
company Societe Generale de Belgique, controls a 13-percent stake in
Generale de Banque.
   The Belga report said Suez preferred Generale de Banque link
itself instead to Banque Indosuez of France.
