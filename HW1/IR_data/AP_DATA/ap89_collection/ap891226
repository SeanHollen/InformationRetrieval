<HEAD>Living Donor Recipient Has Follow-up Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's second recipient of a liver from a
living donor underwent another operation Tuesday to remove a pocket
of infection from her abdomen, officials at the University of
Chicago Hospitals said.
   Sarina Jones, a 16-month-old liver defect victim from
Millington, Tenn., received part of a liver Dec. 8 from her father,
Robert Jones, a dry-wall installer.
   Hospital spokeswoman Susan Phillips said Dr. Jean Emond, a
member of the original transplant team, decided the best way to
deal with the small abcess was to reopen the operation incision to
drain and clear the area of infection.
   ``She tolerated the procedure very well, and was out of the
operating room in about two hours,'' said Ms. Phillips, adding the
infection had not been life-threatening.
   The spokeswoman said Sarina was listed in critical but stable
condition after the two-hour operation, and was expected to be
transferred out of the intensive care ward within several days.
   Also Tuesday, Alyssa Smith, who preceded Sarina as the nation's
first living-donor liver transplant recipient, had her condition
upgraded to serious.
   ``She continues to progress well,'' Ms. Phillips said.
   Alyssa was given a ``day pass'' from the hospital to visit with
her parents on Christmas Day at a Ronald McDonald House for
relatives of ailing children.
   Teresa Smith, 29, an elementary school teacher who donated part
of her liver to her daughter for the Nov. 27 transplant, was
released from the hospital two weeks ago. The Smiths are from
Schertz, Texas.
   Alyssa is expected to leave the hospital sometime after the
first of the year if all continues to go well, according to Ms.
Phillips.
   Sarina and Alyssa suffer from biliary atresia, a usually fatal
congenital defect which is the leading cause of liver transplants
in children.

   An emphysema victim died after igniting a
fire after he tried to light a cigarette while taking oxygen
through his nose, firefighters said.
   Clare Shaw, 59, of Toledo, had been warned not to smoke in bed
in his private room at the Monclova Care Center, fire investigators
said.
   Early Monday's fire was limited to Shaw's bed area, but 15 other
residents were moved as a precaution to the dining area for a
couple of hours, authorities said.

<HEAD>Christians Jam Churches Around East Europe, Remember Romania</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Christians jammed churches in
Eastern Europe to celebrate their first Christmas in freedom after
four decades of Communist rule, but their thoughts also went to the
brave Romanian people.
   In Prague, Leipzig, East Berlin and even in battle-ravaged
Bucharest, the spirit of defiance that had guided Eastern Europeans
to their remarkable revolutions turned into hope for a brighter
future.
   The change was striking in Berlin as people from both sides of
the technically still divided city mingled freely, attending joint
church services for the first time since the Berlin Wall was built
28 years ago.
   East Germany on Sunday began allowing visa-free travel by West
Germans and thousands used the opportunity to cross to East Berlin
to join relatives for a Christmas service.
   ``We had very good attendance this year. Many people from West
Berlin came. Now we really have a feeling of freedom,'' said
Christiana Winter, an East Berliner who was showing West Berliners
around the Lutheran St. Mary's Church.
   ``The church gave hope during all those years when there was no
hope and now we are full of hope.
   ``This year it was important to speak of God's message of love
so that there are no acts of revenge. The church was on the side of
the weak for years and now its is important not to hate those who
treated us unjustly,'' she said.
   The pope's midnight Mass was broadcast live for the first time
by East German television.
   In Leipzig, the cradle of East Germany's pro-democracy movement,
pastor Friedrich Magerius began the service in St. Nicholas Church
by commemorating the thousands of Romanians killed and wounded in
their struggle to overthrow Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   In Leipzig, like in many other towns in East Europe, the church
had sheltered dissidents during the years of oppressive Communist
rule.
   In Bucharest, hundreds of faithful came to the Mitropolia
Cathedral to hear the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church,
Teocitist Arapas, and Christmas carols played on radio for the
first time in more than 40 years.
   The patriarch thanked about 500 believers for coming to the
service despite battles raging in the city between popular forces
and die-hard Ceausescu loyalists.
   ``We must thank God, who gave us freedom after 25 years of
terror,'' the patriarch said, referring to the length of
Ceausescu's dictatorship.
   ``I have been waiting 40 years for this. Now I can openly go to
church,'' said Ion Ganescu, a dissident who spent 10 years in
prison for his opposition to Ceausescu.
   In Poland, where the Roman Catholic Church had enjoyed much more
freedom than churches in other Communist countries, many people
stayed by television sets Sunday night to watch Polish-born Pope
John Paul II celebrate Midnight Mass at the Vatican.
   Thousands attended the midnight service at their local parishes
and crowds filled churches to capacity on Christmas Day to pray and
see traditional nativity scenes, which at some churches comment on
the changes in Eastern Europe. One, at Warsaw's St. Ann's church,
showed the Holy Infant resting upon the fallen Berlin Wall.
   In most of the vast Soviet Union, Christmas will be celebrated
Jan. 7 according to the Russian Orthodox calendar. But in the three
Baltic republics, where there are large populations of Roman
Catholics and Protestants, Christmas was a holiday for the first
time under Soviet rule.
   In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, Roman Catholic activist
Antanas Terleskas said many people attended church as usual. But he
said people were not especially happy, because ``the freedom of
expressing religious beliefs is just an illusion we are permitted
to toy with,'' he said.
   In Riga, Latvia, radio and television broadcast the pope's mass
and activists said church attendance was up.
   In Tallinn, Estonia, people were able to watch the pope's mass
on Finnish television, which they receive easily, and for 12 hours
Estonian television broadcast Christmas carols.
   On Christmas Eve, millions of Czechoslovaks watched Christmas
Mass on an unprecedented live television broadcast. The Mass from
Prague's 13th century Strahov Monastery was said by the Rev. Vaclav
Maly, who the government had banned from the priesthood for 11
years because of his human rights activities.
   Millions of believers jammed into churches and Cathedrals
throughout the country for midnight Mass. On Christmas Day,
90-year-old Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek said Mass at the gothic St.
Vitus Cathedral overlooking the city, delivering a sermon on the
responsibility that freedom brings.
   In central Prague, on the site where mass pro-democracy rallies
turned the tide of Czechoslovak history last month, crowds of
students gathered to sing and share the holiday at the statue of
Bohemia's patron saint _ good King Wenceslas.

<HEAD>100 Days Into de Klerk Presidency, Optimism Seems Contagious</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   There's still doubt whether
President F.W. de Klerk will personally oversee the end of
apartheid, but his performance since his inauguration has raised
hopes higher than ever for peaceful change.
   Even the white-run government's most militant opponents
acknowledge a dramatic shift in mood since P.W. Botha quit the
presidency. They say de Klerk's conciliatory moves resulted from
pressure rather than conviction, but many anti-apartheid leaders
now believe _ for the first time _ that the government sincerely
wants to negotiate with them.
   ``Exit a president named P.W., to be replaced by one named F.W.
Remarkable what a difference that one letter made,'' wrote The
Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper, in its year-end issue.
   ``Suddenly the logjam seemed to break. Good intentions twinkled
around the country. ... For the first time, people of widely
differing views agreed: there is hope in our land.''
   Walter Sisulu, a leader of the outlawed African National
Congress freed by de Klerk in October, said in a remarkably
optimistic Christmas message that he had reason to hope for
``relaxation of tension'' throughout South Africa in the coming
year.
   De Klerk took over as acting president in mid-August after
winning a power struggle with Botha. Even before his inauguration
Sept. 20, two weeks after general elections, de Klerk made his mark
by approving the first mass anti-government marches in decades.
   He marks 100 days from the inauguration on Thursday.
   Since his inauguration, in the words of Johannesburg political
writer Peter Fabricius, de Klerk ``has been a blur of movement,
making a major announcement almost every other day, unraveling the
security establishment, going some way to unbanning the ANC,
consulting a vast spectrum of political figures.''
   Among those consulted was the world's best-known political
prisoner: African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela. The Dec.
13 meeting at de Klerk's Cape Town office was seen as further proof
that Mandela's release is inevitable, probably before de Klerk
opens the new Parliament on Feb. 1.
   During Botha's 11 years in power, the ANC was depicted as a
communist-led terrorist group that had no right to enter
negotiations unless it formally renounced violence.
   De Klerk, by meeting Mandela and unconditionally freeing Sisulu,
has begun the process of acknowledging the guerrilla movement's
legitimacy. The government now says it will talk with any group
committed to peaceful solutions _ the demand for renunciation of
violence has been dropped.
   Seeking to remove obstacles to negotiations, de Klerk has
ordered the abolition of whites-only beaches, proposed repeal of
the law that allows segregated local facilities, and hinted that
the state of emergency imposed in 1986 will be lifted.
   James Selfe, an official of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party,
said de Klerk _ despite a past reputation as a conservative _ has
proven vastly different from previous National Party leaders.
   ``It might even be that the man had an ideological change of
heart after coming into office,'' Selfe said.
   De Klerk has vowed to end discrimination and negotiate a new
constitution that would extend political rights to South Africa's
28 million blacks. But he remains wedded to the concept of racial
groups, and his critics believe he will balk at any steps that
jeopardize the power held by the 5 million whites.
   ``In the process (of defending white control), de Klerk is even
prepared to put apartheid in jeopardy,'' said Fikile Bam, a legal
aid director in Port Elizabeth.
   Wrote The Weekly Mail's editor, Anton Harber: ``By now, de Klerk
has done enough to convince most people that he is sincere in
wanting some form of change. ... However, few of these people are
certain he has the strength or the vision to carry through even
this limited vision.''
   The country's most powerful black moderate, Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is less skeptical.
   ``There are now few who do not take the state president
seriously when he talks about bringing reform,'' Buthelezi said.
``1990 is probably the year in which the government is going to
strike out in the direction of establishing justice and equality
for all.''
   Perhaps de Klerk's most significant move was curbing the
influence of police and army commanders. He halved mandatory
military service for white men from two years to one, proposed
defense spending cuts, and scrapped a bureaucratic network through
which security force officers controlled black townships.
   ``His achievement has been to go a long way to civilianizing the
country again and creating a spirit of glasnost ... as a prelude to
the real challenge of thrashing out a true democracy,'' wrote
Fabricius, political correspondent for The Star newspaper.

   Manuel Blanco rummaged through the
ashes that had been his home and salvaged a balpeen hammer with a
charred handle and a blackened pair of pliers.
   The two tools and the clothes on his back are what remains of
his earthly possessions. Even so, the 70-year-old retired auto
mechanic says he is glad U.S. forces invaded Panama and overthrew
the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``It hurts that I've lost everything, but what are you going to
do? The gringos had to do it like they did. I only wish they would
have done it long ago,'' he said.
   He stood on blackened sheets of corrugated zinc that had been
the roof of the two-story wooden apartment building, where he lived
with his wife and their granddaughter. The only remnans of the
building are two masonry columns that supported the communal
bathrooms.
   Blanco and his neighbors had the misfortune to live a block from
the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega's
command center.
   U.S. tanks and rocket-firing helicopters destroyed the military
headquarters before dawn Wednesday. The barrage sparked fires that
raced through housing in the working class Chorrillo neighborhood,
creating at least 20,000 refugees.
   ``No one has more right to speak than we do, the ones hurt most
by the attack,'' said Ruben Camargo, 37, standing in front of his
ruined home. Camargo, a goldsmith, is luckier than Blanco in that
he lived with his wife and two children in a more substantial
cinderblock structure.
   U.S. forces evacuated the area at daybreak Wednesday, hours
after the assault began.
   Camargo said his 4-year-old daughter was traumatized by the
hours of fire and bombing, and she wakes up crying during the night.
   ``One single person is guilty of all this. So much death because
of one man, and that man's name is Manuel Antonio Noriega,'' said
Camargo when asked if he resents the invaders.
   Of a dozen Chorrillo residents inteviewed by The Associated
Press, all applauded the U.S. action.
   The closest thing to criticism was voiced by taxi driver Bolivar
Escobar, 32, standing in his flooded home on the ground floor of
the destroyed housing block. Most of his family's possessions were
wrecked or looted. He had salvaged a red cape embroidered with
silver trim _ a costume that his 11-year-old daughter had worn.
   ``The invasion itself was correct, the form no,'' he said.
``They should have come with much more personnel to establish
positions corner by corner, to prevent looting. And they could have
used less shelling. A lot of people died in their sleep. Now we
have to start from zero,'' he said.
   Hospital authorities estimated between 200 and 300 people were
killed in the invasion, at least half of them civilians. Hundreds
more were injured.
   ``It was the only way to get him (Noriega) out,'' said Camargo.
``He could have quit and given us all the gift of a happy
Christmas, not this bitter Christmas we're having.''
   The perception of the Americans as liberators underscores the
relationship the United States and Panama have enjoyed since Panama
was created, through seccession from Colombia, by President
Theodore Roosevelt's gunboat diplomacy in 1903.
   Panama's currency is the U.S. dollar and its economy has always
been closely linked to the U.S.-built and jointly administered
canal. The national pastime is baseball and virtually all males
over 8 years old follow the U.S. big leagues.
   ``Not only are we happy with the invasion. Most people here
would like Panama to be the 51st star on the U.S. flag,'' said a
middle-aged woman.
   Camargo, Blanco and about 9,000 Chorrillo refugees are being
sheltered and fed by U.S. troops at Balboa High School, two miles
away.
   They, like a dozen others interviewed in the wasteland around
the Defense Forces headquarters, appealed for reconstruction aid
from the U.S.-installed government of President Guillermo Endara
and from Washington.
   Sergio Delgado loaded some soggy sofa cushions from his house
onto his brother-in-law's pickup.
   ``We've suffered, but finally that corruption is ended,'' he
said. ``The Panamanian people have been asking for a long time for
the North Americans to intervene.''

<HEAD>Teen-ager Emerges From Coma in Time For Christmas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just last week, doctors thought
18-year-old Melissa ``Missy'' Goebel would remain in a coma for
years.
   On Christmas Day, the Mead High School honors student was
talking and watching as family members opened presents for her at
Sacred Heart Medical Center.
   ``I thought the very best Christmas present I could ever get was
to hear my daughter talk again,'' said Missy's father, Steve. ``She
gave me that gift with a week to spare. And each day she gets a
little bit better.''
   Missy was injured Nov. 25 in a head-on collision on Interstate
90, just west of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
   Ms. Goebel and her 16-year-old boyfriend were in her car when
they collided with a pickup truck traveling the wrong way. Ian
McElfish, the boyfriend, was treated and released. The 79-year-old
driver of the pickup is now in a nursing home.
   A month ago, doctors, family members and friends thought Melissa
would die.
   Missy was in a coma, largely unresponsive to talking and
touching by family members. On Day 19, doctors said Goebel most
likely would be comatose for years.
   But just a few hours after doctors left her room that day, Missy
spoke to her mother. Then, she asked to telephone her brother,
despite her head injuries and a broken neck, clavicle, right arm
and left leg.
   ``She's a little miracle,'' said Victoria Goebel, Missy's
mother. ``She's quite an amazing girl.''
   Mrs. Goebel said she welcomed the sound of Missy bickering with
her younger brother, Brian.
   ``She calls her brother a dweeb a lot,'' the mother said, adding
that the siblings were close friends. ``I couldn't believe it when
they were in there arguing the other day. It was great.''
   Missy's struggle is far from over. The left side of her body
remains paralyzed.
   Goebel said his daughter often slips into a ``kind of dream
state'' and gets confused easily.
   ``She's pretty much like a rag doll,'' he said. ``But she's
further along than anyone ever thought she would be.''

   Former burlesque queen Blaze Starr is
still seeing stars after a whirlwind trip to New York for the
premiere of ``Blaze,'' a film based on her love affair with former
Louisiana Gov. Earl K. Long.
   ``I felt like Cinderella after the ball when I got out of the
limousine and boarded the plane home,'' Starr said. ``Unlike
Cinderella, though, I am very glad to be here.''
   Starr is back selling her homemade jewelry in a Maryland mall,
but she said she loved her five-day stay last week in New York.
   ``Every time we stepped out of the hotel, we stepped into a
stretch,'' she said. ``Nobody calls them limos.''
   Starr did all she could in New York to promote the movie, from
which she will earn 4 percent of the profits. She participated in
14 straight hours of interviews along with actors Paul Newman and
Lolita Davidovitch and director Ron Shelton.
   Many critics have praised the movie, but decried its historic
inaccuracies. For one, the movie has Long dying on Starr's lap,
when he actually suffered a fatal heart attack nowhere near his
sweetheart.
   Starr said she flew to Baton Rouge where his body lay in state.
   ``I walked into the Capitol with a single red rose in my
breasts. I didn't look right or left as I walked to the casket,''
she said. ``Then, I pulled out the rose and said `This is for you,
Earl.' I knew that's what he would like.''

   Actress Jessica Lange has become accustomed to
working in movies that are not commercial films.
   ``So if one of them does become that, it would be a real
surprise to me,'' she said.
   ``It's just because I'm attracted to things that are somewhat
out of the mainstream,'' she said in an interview in the January
issue of Premiere magazine.
   The 40-year-old Lange's latest roles are in Costa-Gavras'
``Music Box,'' in which she plays a Chicago lawyer contesting
charges that her father is a Nazi war criminal. She's also in Paul
Brickman's ``Men Don't Leave,'' in which she plays a newly widowed
mother.
   ``The roles and the stories that make it interesting for me to
spend six months or three months of my life involved in the playing
of are maybe not what's going to appeal to the majority, which is
fine,'' she said.
   Langes lives with actor-playwright Sam Shepard and they have two
children. She has a third child by dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov.

   Leonard Bernstein conducted an orchestra of
international musicians to celebrate the struggle for freedom
throughout Eastern Europe, and then appealed for brotherhood in
East and West Germany.
   ``I am experiencing a historical moment _ incomparable with
others in my long, long life,'' the American conductor said during
the performance, which was broadcast live in more than 20 countries.
   The Christmas performance of Beethoven's ``Ninth Symphony''
capped three days of concerts. The symphony was inspired by 18th
century German writer Friedrich Schiller's poem ``Ode to Joy.''
   In the concert, Bernstein substituted the word ``freedom'' for
``joy'' in the chorus to reflect his personal message.
   The 71-year-old musician conducted the same symphony in West
Berlin in a performance timed to end at midnight Saturday, when
West Germans were allowed to travel without visas into East Germany
for the first time.
   The musicians were from East and West Germany as well as the
United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ the four
victorious World War II allies still technically responsible for
governing Berlin.
   The East German government presented Bernstein the ``Star of
People's Friendship.''

   Alyssa Smith, the 22-month-old girl who underwent
the nation's first liver transplant from a living donor, played
with Christmas gifts sent by well-wishers from strangers including
Frank Sinatra.
   ``She's received a lot of cards and gifts from everywhere,'' her
father John Smith said Monday. ``People from all walks of life have
given things like dolls and stuff.
   ``Frank Sinatra sent her a doll,'' added the father. ``I thought
that was real neat. People sent cards and money. That made us feel
very loved.''
   Alyssa and 16-month-old Sarina Jones, who received the nation's
second living-donor liver transplant, were recovering remarkably
well at the University of Chicago Medical Center, though both girls
remained in critical but stable condition, spokeswoman Susan
Phillips said.
   The girls suffered from biliary atresia, a usually fatal
congenital defect.
   Alyssa received her transplant from her 29-year-old mother,
Teresa, an elementary school teacher who was released from the
hospital two weeks ago.
   Since her Nov. 27 transplant, Alyssa has undergone three
operations to stop bleeding on the liver's surface, but doctors say
she still is expected to be able to leave the hospital sometime
after Jan. 1.
   Said the girl's father, ``If the surgery had not been good, we'd
not be having the Christmas we're having.''

Andre Rison was in too much of a hurry to get home for Christmas.
   Rison was charged with reckless driving early Monday after
police clocked him at driving his 1989 Mercedes at 128 mph on
Interstate 69 near Fort Wayne, authorities said. The speed limit is
55 mph.
   He was taken to the Allen County Lockup where he posted $500
bond and was released.
   ``He told the officer he thought he was driving between 95 and
100 miles per hour because he said that's what it feels like when
you're driving 55 miles per hour in a regular car,'' said Sgt.
Dallard Tackett of the State Police post at Fort Wayne.
   Rison, the Colts' top draft pick out of Michigan State, was
headed to Flint, Mich., for Christmas. The Colts' season ended

   Twenty years after President Nixon ordered the
destruction of the U.S. stockpile of biological weapons, the
federal government is on the verge of making development and
possession of the weapons illegal.
   Although Nixon's directive met with little resistance and the
United States joined the Soviet Union and 109 other countries in
signing a 1972 pact to prohibit production and possession of the
weapons, efforts to incorporate the treaty's provisions into U.S.
law have failed _ until this year.
   Scientists, defense analysts and lawmakers credit the Bush
administration, the changing atmosphere for arms control agreements
and the work of a freshman senator from Wisconsin who has little
foreign policy background.
   ``If I had to pick any of the 100 senators, it would not be him,
even the top 80,'' John Isaacs of the liberal Council for a Livable
World said in a recent interview. ``He was the new kid on the
block.''
   The kid is Democratic Sen. Herbert Kohl, who with the help of a
longtime opponent of biological and chemical weapons, Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., convinced the Justice Department and the full Senate
to support the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.
   In the waning hours of the congressional session on Nov. 21, the
Senate approved the legislatio by voice vote. House passage and
presidential approval appear likely early next year.
   ``By approving the legislation, the Senate has signaled the
world that the United States is serious about controlling these
abominable creations,'' Kohl said on the Senate floor.
   By definition, biological weapons are a form of bacteria, virus,
fungus or naturally occurring toxin. A biological weapon could be
unleashed on an unsuspecting public by using it in a liquid to
contaminate water or in an aerosol that is dropped by bomb.
   In 1925, the Geneva Protocol banned the first use in war of
biological and chemical weapons, but did not address the
development, production, possession or transfer of the weapons.
   Forty-four years later, Nixon ordered the Defense Department to
destroy its arsenal of biological weapons. The United States then
spearheaded the fight for an international ban on production and
possession of the weapons. On April 10, 1972, in Washington, Moscow
and London, 111 countries signed the Biological Weapons Convention.
   The Senate ratified the treaty two years later.
   According to the pact, each nation must take ``any necessary
measures'' to prohibit biological weapons at home. Legislation was
introduced in Congress over the years to include the prohibition in
U.S. law, but the measures never got far.
   Among the problems during the 1980s, according to the
legislation's House sponsor, Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., was
the view of the Reagan administration.
   ``This administration is somewhat different,'' Kastenmeier said
in an interview. ``During eight years of the Reagan administration,
candidly speaking, they were not really for this legislation. ...
They felt we didn't need this.''
   But with the Bush administration's support for the bill and the
``tenor of the times'' for arms control legislation, said Kohl, the
biological weapons bill won easy Senate approval after just a
handful of hearings.
   ``It was the right time, the right place, the right bill,'' Kohl
said.
   The measure's purpose is twofold. It implements the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention and seeks to protect the United
States against the threat of biological terrorism.
   ``The legislation would prohibit the possession or development
of germ warfare devices and authorize the punishment of those who
attempt to help foreign nations acquire such weapons,'' the bill
says.
   Kohl believes final congressional approval and Bush's signature
would strengthen the United States' hand in demanding that all
countries comply with the 1972 treaty.
   The administration is concerned about countries with the
capability to produce biological weapons, including Iran, Iraq,
Syria and Israel. The official list remains classified.

<HEAD>US Pool Reporters in Panama: Late for the Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLON, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under cloak of darkness, the U.S. army
helicopter flew the length of the Panama Canal taking a pair of
reporters, a photographer and a television crew to this port city.
   But soon after they arrived, members of the group realized that
they'd missed the story. Again.
   Soldiers told of entering the city on Friday afternoon to the
cheers of citizens who draped American flags from their balconies.
They told how the local groups helped the U.S. soldiers round up
Noriega loyalists, and how deeply moving the scene had been.
   But more than two days after the invasion began, the U.S.
military still was keeping the media away from its operations until
they were over.
   The Pentagon news pool, created to cover American military
actions in a way that would protect important operational secrecy,
was still on its way to Panama last Wednesday when the invasion
began.
   Arriving in the country, the pool had to cool its heels for
hours inside a U.S. army base and found out the details of the
attack the same way everyone else in America did _ on television,
based on reports from other news people already in the city.
   The group arrived at the battle area around Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's headquarters after the battle was over. They viewed
Noriega's private retreats after they'd been disturbed by military
investigators, and saw people who had been rescued, but not the
rescue itself.
   After a while, the pool members decided their motto should be
``semper tardis,'' or ``always late.''
   The U.S. Southern Command showed reporters the spoils of war but
not the war itself, which was, of course, the reason for the pool
in the first place.
   Exposure to ongoing events was almost an accident for the pool,
but it happened. For example:
   _An alert photographer yelling ``Whoa!'' got the press bus to
stop at a makeshift prisoner-of-war camp.
   _Reporters heading to a pre-set downtown site received an
extraordinary view of looting and mayhem when their driver got lost.
   _The press corps couldn't help but witness a surprise attack on
Southern Command headquarters, the site of the press center.
   _On a trip to interview U.S. commanders west of the city,
reporters happened upon an extraordinary scene: more than a
thousand people cheering wildly as Noriega loyalists surrendered
their weapons to U.S. soldiers.
   All around the country, American GIs and local citizens were
more than happy to tell their stories. But, not being witnesses
themselves, reporters were forced to piece things together and deal
with difficult contradictions.
   At Rio Hato, a Panamanian army base west of Panama City, Army
rangers fresh from their first real combat told of parachuting into
an intense firefight. Several U.S. lives were lost, and one
paratrooper was shot in the doorway of his C-130 aircraft as he
prepared to jump, they said. His Ranger comrades had to pull him
back to save his life.
   But back in Washington, the brass was saying how the attack on
Rio Hato had been cleared of resistance thanks to new Stealth
fighter planes which evaded radar for a bombing run which
distracted the defenders.
   At Fort Amador near Panama City was the ``Witch House,'' a
modest residence where Noriega was said to have kept his four
Brazilian voodoo witches.
   Reporters were shown the evidence of strange ritual: a bucket of
blood, animal entrails, and a variety of religious artifacts
carefully arranged on a desk that apparently served as an altar.
   But before reporters were allowed in, the military removed what
soldiers said were packets of cocaine wrapped in tropical leaves.
   Soldiers who confiscated the stockpile described their haul as
about 50 pounds of cocaine. At headquarters and in Washington, the
generals said it was 50 kilograms, which, at 2.2 pounds per kilo,
would better back up the U.S. claim that Noriega was involved
heavily in the drug trade.
   It was possible the generals were referring to cocaine also
recovered elsewhere, but reporters never were able to reconcile the
figures.

   The manslaughter conviction of a Hispanic officer
in the deaths of two blacks had raised hopes for healing a decade
of racial tension. Instead, the verdict has spread tensions within
police ranks.
   Talk of a work slowdown by the police and an allegation that a
Hispanic policeman hesitated before responding to a backup request
from a black officer have embroiled the force in recent weeks.
   The local branch of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People even asked Gov. Bob Martinez on Friday to have
National Guardsmen patrol Miami's black neighborhoods.
   ``If I needed police protection, I would not feel comfortable
calling the police because of the attitude of some of the
officers,'' said the NAACP's Johnnie McMillian.
   Martinez rejected McMillian's request, and Mayor Xavier Suarez
and Police Chief Perry Anderson assured the community that officers
of all races would act professionally.
   Tensions have been evident since a jury found Colombian-born
officer William Lozano guilty Dec. 7 in the deaths of black
motorcyclist Clement Lloyd and his passenger, Allan Blanchard.
   During the past two weeks, an Hispanic Miami officer and a white
Metro-Dade policeman have been suspended for wearing black tape on
their badges or black wristbands to protest the verdict.
   The Police Benevolent Association has raised funds and presented
Lozano with a ``Brotherhood in Blue'' T-shirt _ a mocking reference
to the term prosecutors used during the trial to accuse officers of
protecting each other.
   Many black officers, however, agreed with the verdict and see
fund-raising, wristbands and clemency petitions as a slap in the
face.
   ``For the very people who uphold law and order, to take
exception in such a blatant manner, is extremely insensitive,''
said Officer Sam Harlan, head of the Black Officers Association.
   But to many other officers, Lozano is seen as a martyr to the
community's desperation to avoid a fifth race riot in the 1980s.
   Two previous disturbances followed acquittals of officers
charged with killing blacks, and the Jan. 16 deaths of Lloyd and
Blanchard ignited three days of riots.
   ``It wouldn't have made a difference whether he was Hispanic or
black _ he didn't receive a fair trial,'' said Martin Garcia, head
of the Hispanic Officer's Association.
   Garcia defended officers' action in support of Lozano. He said
some black officers cheered and gave each other high-fives when the
conviction was announced.
   ``If the blacks were permitted to celebrate, then we have the
right to protest,'' Garcia said.
   Some community leaders have blamed past racial violence on a
feeling by blacks that they are being left behind while the
Hispanic population grows in size, wealth and influence.
   Hispanic gains in the community have been reflected in the Miami
police force during the past decade. Today, 44 percent of the
force's 1,100 officers are Hispanic, 19 percent are black and 37
percent non-Hispanic white. The changes have created divisions that
didn't exist before, when Hispanics joined blacks in challenging
``Anglos'' for jobs and promotions, Garcia said.
   ``Before, we probably had better working relations with black
officers than we did with Anglo officers _ but not now,'' Garcia
said.
   In the week following Lozano's conviction, a Hispanic officer
was accused of stalling on the way to the aid of a black officer
who had called for assistance. The incident prompted a meeting of
the Hispanic and black officers associations with police officials
to soothe the tension.
   ``This used to be a war between the police and the criminal,''
said Hialeah Police Chief Rolando Bolanos, who mediated the
meeting. ``We do not need to have a war between police and police.''
   The mayor also met with Garcia and police unions. ``They showed
a lot of sensitivity,'' Suarez said.
   Nevertheless, police unions continue to fight the suspensions of
the two officers punished for the black bands and raise money for
Lozano's appeal. Members of the Fraternal Order of Police each have
agreed to donate $260 to defray Lozano's legal expenses.
   The Hispanic Officers Association is selling its own T-shirts
and distributing black wristbands to departments around the state,
said Garcia. Although police chiefs have banned in-uniform displays
of support, many Miami-area officers wear black wristbands off-duty.
   Roy Black, Lozano's defense attorney, said he hasn't been
surprised by the support.
   ``A lot of people didn't take it seriously until he was
convicted,'' Black said. ``I get more calls all the time from
people, many of them police officers, who want to know what they
can do.''

<HEAD>Employment Rights Bill Tops Civil Rights Shopping List on Capitol
Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights forces, stunned by what they see
as a wave of setbacks in the Supreme Court last June, are putting a
congressional agenda forward for next year.
   ``We'll have a fight but we'll win because civil rights is
looked upon with favor these days,'' declares Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif.
   A civil rights bill, set to be unveiled soon after lawmakers
return from the holidays, could focus political pressure on the
Bush administration. Opposition would risk alienating the black
community while support would mean repudiation of court decisions
that have found favor among conservatives.
   The sponsors, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Rep. Augustus F.
Hawkins, D-Calif., and bipartisan coalitions in both houses are
expected to introduce the bill soon after the 1990 congressional
session gets under way.
   Thus far, Justice Department officials have been saying they see
no problem with recent rulings on the employment discrimination
front. They have said they would monitor the results to determine
whether legislation is needed.
   Civil rights forces say it is needed now. While details are not
available, proponents say the measure will be designed in large
part to counter three decisions by the Supreme Court last June:
   _The court held in a June 5 decision involving two salmon
canneries that plaintiffs in hiring bias suits have the burden of
proving the practices at issue have no legitimate business purpose.
Prior to the so-called Wards Cove decision _ named for a packing
company that figured in the case _ it was the employer who had to
prove that there was a legitimate business reason.
   _The justices on June 12 cleared the way for challenges to
longstanding, court-approved agreements giving minorities and women
preference in hiring for government jobs. The Martin vs. Wilke
case, involving Birmingham, Ala., firefighters, was viewed as a
sharp setback for affirmative action plans.
   _The court ruled June 15 that a civil rights law does not bar
racial harassment in the workplace. The Patterson case was brought
by a black woman from North Carolina who said she was mistreated on
the job because of her race.
   In each case, the court was divided 5-4.
   ``What has happened is that the Supreme Court, in its
mischievousness, in the past year has actually gutted title 7 of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act,'' said Althea Simmons, lobbyist for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Title 7
is the job bias portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   Legislation to counter the decisions ``has to pass _ we have no
choice but to pass it,'' she said. ``If you ask, `Is it going to be
smooth sailing?,' I think we have to work hard to pass it, but I
think it's going to pass.''
   Actually, winning approval for the measure might not turn out to
be such a formidable task. No longer the embattled underdogs of
yesteryear, civil rights forces have been getting most of what they
want from Congress, often by margins as wide as 70 percent in each
house.
   ``We expect very substantial bipartisan majorities in both
houses of Congress to support this vital legislation,'' said Ralph
Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, an umbrella group that includes virtually every civil
rights organization active in Washington.
   Both Ms. Simmons and Neas described the employment rights
measure as far and away the top item on the civil rights agenda for
the year ahead. But civil rights forces are pressing for a wide
array of other items.
   They are hoping for legislation to counter a Supreme Court
decision in a Richmond, Va., case that struck a severe blow at
set-asides that reserve a portion of government contracts for
minority-owned business. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., is planning
hearings.
   Legislation to guarantee civil rights for Americans with
disabilities already has been passed by the Senate following a
compromise agreement with the Bush administration. Action in three
House committees is expected when Congress returns from its break.
   Pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee is House-passed
legislation that would order the government to gather statistics on
so-called hate crimes, directed against racial, religious and
ethnic minorities.
   Committees in both houses have approved legislation that would
guarantee employee rights to medical leave in cases involving
birth, adoption and serious illness.
   A conference committee currently is attempting to resolve
differences between House and Senate versions of legislation to
provide federal aid for child care, either through grants to states
or tax credits. Leaders in both houses have said the measure will
get high priority.
   Incorporated into legislation to reestablish the death penalty
now pending in the Senate is an amendment to bar racial
discrimination in imposing it.
   Civil rights forces also are pressing the House to attach
anti-discrimination provisions to pending legislation that would
allow voter registration through the mail, provide automatic
registration for anyone with a driver's license and require
government agencies to register voters.
   Also pending is Senate-passed legislation that would reauthorize
through 1994 discretionary programs to aid handicapped students.
Civil rights forces plan to press Congress again for legislation
that would guarantee Americans affordable housing.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxpayers receive their annual holiday
greetings from Uncle Sam starting today, as the Internal Revenue
Service mails out more than 107 million tax forms and instruction
packages.
   The forms, which have been waiting at post offices across the
nation for weeks, should be in most taxpayers' hands before Jan. 1.
   The IRS always times the mailing, which costs $26 million for
postage and printing, to come right after the crush of Christmas
mail but soon enough to give taxpayers as much time as possible to
complete their returns before the filing deadline, which falls this
year on April 16.
   For taxpayers still reeling from the sweeping changes wrought by
the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the IRS has reassuring words: the new
forms look very much like last year's forms.
   But to the chagrin of IRS officials, one of the few changes
should not have been made, and it could confuse millions of elderly
Americans.
   The IRS is trying to get the word out to taxpayers eligible for
Medicare that they should ignore the lines on the tax form covering
the supplemental Medicare premium. Congress did away with the
premium along with the catastrophic health program it was designed
to fund.
   But Congress did not vote to repeal the controversial program
until late November, long after the IRS forms had gone to the
printers.
   The IRS hopes to keep confusion to a minimum through a publicity
campaign to get word to the 12 million elderly taxpayers who could
be affected. In addition, IRS officials note that the form
taxpayers would need to compute their Medicare premium tax
liability, Form 8808, does not exist.
   ``We believe that taxpayers will not want to pay taxes that they
don't have to pay,'' said IRS official Arthur Altman.
   But Altman said that if taxpayers still include an amount on the
Medicare premium line, the IRS will refund the money.
   This year's returns are accompanied by a special pitch from new
IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who urges taxpayers to
consider filing their returns electronically to cut down on the
time it takes to process their refund checks.
   The IRS is providing a special toll-free telephone number,
1-800-424-1040, for people to call for a list of tax preparers in
their area who can file returns electronically.
   In 1988, two-thirds of all taxpayers qualified for a refund,
with the average refund totaling $875.
   All of the changes in this year's forms are explained in the
accompanying instruction booklets, which also include a list of
other IRS publications that offer further help in preparing taxes.
To request additional tax forms and the tax information
publications, taxpayers can call the IRS at 1-800-424-3676.
   Among the changes featured in this year's forms:
   _The personal exemption, the amount you may exempt from taxation
for yourself, your spouse and each dependent, increases to $2,000
per person, up from $1,950 last year.
   _The standard deduction, claimed by people who do not itemize,
rises to $3,100 for a single person, up from $3,000 last year. The
exemption for a couple increases to $5,200, up from $5,000 last
year.
   _Tax rates remain the same at 15 percent, 28 percent and 33
percent with about four of every five taxpayers paying only the
lowest rate. While the rates stay the same, the tax brackets have
been widened so that more income will be taxed at lower rates in
order to compensate for inflation.
   _For the first time, the IRS will include two name lines,
instead of one, in recognition that more married couples have
different last names.
   The IRS is looking for 111.2 million individual tax returns to
be filed this year with 65 percent expected to opt for the
comprehensive Form 1040, designed for taxpayers who itemize or who
have incomes above $50,000 annually.
   Two shorter forms, Form 1040A and the brief nine-line Form
1040EZ, are available for taxpayers who do not itemize and can meet
other qualifications.
   The IRS form each taxpayer receives is based on the form that
taxpayer used last year.

<HEAD>China Faces Growing Demand for Imported Wheat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is the world's largest wheat producer
but is not keeping pace with its own consumer demand for more
bread, noodles and dumplings.
   As a result, China has been buying huge amounts of wheat from
other countries, including the United States. An Agriculture
Department analyst says import demand will continue to grow, at
least through the turn of the century.
   ``Even though it is the world's largest producer of wheat,
China's domestic demand exceeds supplies,'' says Frederick W. Crook
of the department's Economic Research Service. ``Wheat output has
risen steadily as farmers have boosted yields because of greater
irrigation and use of improved varieties.''
   Crook, in a report on China's wheat economy, said population
growth and ``consumer preference for wheat products'' such as
noodles, steamed dumplings, bread and pastries have spurred demand.
   As the world's most populous country with 1.1 billion people,
even slight changes in per capita use can translate into large
numbers.
   Crook said per capita wheat consumption rose steadily from 29
kilograms in 1960 to 48 kilos in 1978. Then, as supplies increased
because of import and production gains, the average jumped to 90
kilograms per person in 1987.
   A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. Ninety kilos would be about 198
pounds, or approximately 3.3 bushels of wheat, allowing 60 pounds
per bushel.
   China has been at peaks and valleys as a customer of U.S. wheat
farmers since the early 1970s. Lately, Beijing has been a large and
consistent buyer of U.S. wheat, rivaling the Soviet Union at times.
   In the 1988-89 wheat marketing year that ran through last May
31, China imported almost 8.1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat and
became the largest foreign customer of American growers. The Soviet
Union, by comparison, imported 4.96 million tons in the same period.
   So far in 1989-90, China has bought about 4.7 million tons
against the Soviet Union's purchases as of Dec. 14 of less than 2
million tons.
   A metric ton, the unit favored in world grain trade, is about
2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. It also is
equal to 1,000 kilograms.
   Both China and the Soviet Union have bought large amounts of
wheat under a U.S. price subsidy arrangement, the Export
Enhancement Program. Under EEP, private exporters can sell to
designated foreign countries at reduced prices and then collect
USDA-owned commodities as ``bonuses'' or subsidies to make up the
price difference.
   From a production standpoint, China has been the world's largest
wheat producer in four of the last five years, according to USDA
statistics.
   China's wheat output this year, for example, is estimated at 91
million tons, compared with 89 million for the Soviet Union and
55.6 million for the United States.
   Other major producers this year include: Canada, 24.4 million
tons; Australia, 12.5 million; Argentina, 10.7 million; India, 53
million; Eastern Europe, 42.3 million; and the European Economic
Community, 79.3 million.
   Crook said that by world standards China has achieved ``fairly
high wheat yields'' and is surpassing those in India, Pakistan and
countries which have large areas of non-irrigated wheat, such as
Canada, Australia, the Soviet Union and the United States.
   On the other hand, Crook said wheat yields are higher in Mexico,
France, Poland and Japan.
   Crook said that Chinese experts predict wheat yields will climb
an average of about 1.65 percent a year and that by the year 2000
there will be some decrease in total wheat area. But they claim
that total output by then will increase to between 100 million and
105 million tons.
   ``China's population will continue to grow in the next decade,
and if per capita income continues to rise, demand for wheat will
also increase,'' Crook said. ``However, prospects for rapid gains
in domestic wheat output are dim because little arable (land) can
be shifted to wheat production, and yields are already high.''
   As a result, he added, the outlook for wheat exports to China
``looks promising in the near future.'' But the rate of growth will
depend mostly on the ability of the rest of China's economy to earn
foreign exchange.

<HEAD>Authorities: Retired Police Officer Shoots Chronically Ill Wife</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired policeman who was facing major heart
surgery fatally shot his ailing wife because he was afraid he
couldn't take care of her and didn't want her to suffer anymore,
authorities say.
   Gerald Williams, 67, was charged with first-degree murder in the
death of his wife, Alice, who suffered from multiple sclerosis,
said Police Sgt. Ronald Palmer
   Williams was released on personal recognizance into his
daughter's custody after a Christmas Day hearing.
   The prosecutor agreed with a defense lawyer that Williams, who
retired six years ago, posed no threat to society.
   ``Good luck and Merry Christmas,'' Circuit Court Judge Sheldon
Garber told Williams at the close of the hearing.
   Williams was scheduled to appear for another hearing today.
   Mrs. Williams, 64, apparently died instantly Christmas Eve when
her husband of 44 years shot her in the head with a .38-caliber
revolver as she sat in her wheelchair, Palmer said.
   Williams then called police and handed over the gun when
officers arrived at the home, Palmer said.
   ``It's a sad thing to happen on any day, and it just seems to be
embellished by the fact that it's Christmas Eve,'' said Palmer.
   Williams told the officers that ``all his wife did was complain
about how much she was suffering and she begged him to end it,''
Palmer said.
   Williams' doctor recently told him he needed a second major
heart operation and he wouldn't be able to care for his wife,
according to an account given to police by Williams' daughter.
   Mrs. Williams suffered from multiple sclerosis, a degenerative
disease of the nervous system, for 20 years, and had heart and
kidney problems, Palmer said.
   ``His health wasn't the best and hers was deteriorating,''
Palmer said. ``I'm sure the guy is overwrought.''

<HEAD>Cuba Believed Sending Weapons to Leftists by Remote Mexican Route</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba is believed to be using a remote Mexican
land route to send weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador, U.S.
officials say.
   Cuba is believed to have started using the alternate route some
time ago, and indications are that use of the route _ beginning in
the Yucatan Peninsula _ has increased recently, said the officials,
who asked not to be identified.
   Cuba has traditionally used Nicaragua as its primary transit
point for weapons deliveries to its allies in El Salvador.
   It was not clear whether Mexican officials have been approached
by U.S. diplomats about the alleged shipments. There was no
immediate comment from the Mexican government.
   Historically, Mexico has been sympathetic to the Salvadoran
rebels but that support has been more muted since President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari took office a year ago.
   Much of the weaponry sent to the Salvadoran insurgents is
supplied by the Soviet bloc and delivered via Cuba, according to
officials. Recent administration statements indicate that it sees
Cuba _ not the Soviet bloc _ as the principal villain in these
activities.
   As described by officials, the Cubans ship the weapons across
the narrow channel that separates Cuba from the Yucatan Peninsula.
From there, the equipment is sent by truck to El Salvador via
Guatemala although the precise route is not clear.
   Nicaragua's leftist government has been criticized
internationally for its alleged collaboration with Cuba in
supporting the Salvadoran rebels.
   As U.S. officials see it, Cuba's apparent search for new ways to
help the Salvadoran rebels _ without relying exclusively on
Nicaragua _ may be an effort to limit the chances that the
Sandinista role will be exposed more than it has been.
   Nicaragua has denied that its territory has been used for
subversive activities in El Salvador. Such interference is a
violation of Central American agreements signed by Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega.
   The Sandinista government has been in the forefront of the
international effort over the past week to have the Bush
administration condemned for its invasion of Panama. Cuba's
response also has been indignant.
   The administration views Cuba's purported use of the route
through Mexico as a supplement to the support the Nicaraguans are
providing as a transit point for Cuban-supplied weapons.
   As evidence that the Sandinista connection has not been
abandoned, the administration has cited the discovery of weapons by
Honduran officials aboard a truck said to have been headed to El
Salvador from Nicaragua.
   The driver of the truck involved in the Oct. 18 weapons seizure
told authorities he had been making the run between Nicaragua and
El Salvador monthly since August 1988.
   According to officials, a more revealing incident occurred on
Nov. 25 when a plane carrying surface-to-air missiles crashed in El
Salvador. The plane had taken off from Nicaragua and its
destination reportedly was rebel-held territory in El Salvador.
   The officials contend Cuba and Nicaragua are intent on providing
assistance to the Salvadoran rebels during the current period
because it may be more difficult in the coming months. One reason:
peacekeepers from the United Nations are being assigned to Central
America to ensure that provisions of regional agreements are being
kept.
   The Bush administration has been pressing U.N. officials to
ensure that the peacekeepers, among other duties, are on the
lookout for deliveries to the Salvadoran rebels from outside the
county's borders.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at
yet another record high Tuesday, while the dollar edged down
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 257.69 points, or 0.67
percent, ending at 38,681.31. The index had gained 383.25 points
Monday as investors welcomed the third discount rate increase by
the Bank of Japan this year. The previous record was 38,586.18 on
Dec. 18.
   The dollar closed at 142.37 yen, down 0.35 yen from its finish
of 142.72 yen on Monday, when it fell 0.95 yen. It opened Tuesday
at 142.94 yen and ranged between 142.30 yen and 142.95 yen.
   ``Share prices were higher almost all across the board,'' said
Tatsuo Kurokawa, an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   Although stock investors are normally discouraged by a discount
rate hike, they boosted buy orders following the Monday
announcement by the central bank, mainly because investors were
reassured that there would be no more major changes in monetary
policy for a while, Kurokawa said.
   The Bank of Japan raised the discount rate to 4.25 percent from
its current level at 3.75 percent.
   The discount rate is the rate the central bank charges on its
loans to commercial banks.
   ``A majority of market players think all the negative factors in
the market have disappeared,'' Kurokawa said.
   In currency dealings, the market was quiet becuase many overseas
markets, including those in New York and London, were closed for
Christmas holidays, traders said.
   After the dollar hit a high at 142.95 yen, investors began to
sell the currency for profit-taking and small position adjustments,
they said.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities, Co., said the dollar-yen rate remained inactive because
the market had already responded to the discount rate hike Monday.
   ``The market had been well prepared for the hike since the rumor
had come out last Tuesday,'' Kanai said. ``Everybody knew there
would be a 0.5 percentage point hike, so the hike yesterday had
little impact.''
   Also, traders said that a mere 0.5 percentage-point raise would
not boost yen-buying because Japan's discount rate is still
substantially lower than those of other industrialized nations.
   Market players were reluctant to buy the dollar as well, due to
uncertainties over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will cut
its discount rate, Kanai said.

<HEAD>China Charges Five With Helping Dissidents Flee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China says it arrested five Hong Kong and Macao
residents on charges of trying to smuggle dissidents out of the
country and today accused a Hong Kong group of running an
``underground railroad.''
   China said the Hong Kong Alliance for Supporting the Democratic
Movement in China helped dozens of dissidents flee abroad since the
army crackdown on pro-democracy protests in June.
   Police said the arrests ``dealt a major blow to the overseas
reactionary forces who attempted to use Hong Kong and Macao as
sanctuaries for criminals,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said
in a report Monday.
   The five arrests were made over the past three months, and
Xinhua did not say why they were being announced only now. It said
China will ``punish severely those who dare to plot and ship wanted
criminals out of the mainland.''
   China has said repeatedly it will not allow residents of Hong
Kong and Macao to interfere in mainland affairs, but this was the
first time it explicitly accused the Hong Kong alliance of running
the underground railroad.
   The alliance was founded after the June crackdown, which
increased anxiety in British-ruled Hong Kong and Portuguese-ruled
Macao about their return to Chinese rule in the coming decade.
   The official People's Daily defended the arrests in an editorial
in today's editions, saying ``Hong Kong and Macao residents must
obey Chinese laws when on the mainland.''
   In excerpts of the editorial, the paper accused the alliance of
smuggling abroad ``important counter-revolutionary criminals. ...
The Chinese government will never tolerate such activities.''
   China considers ethnic Chinese from the two colonies to be
Chinese citizens and has rejected past efforts by Britain to
intervene on behalf of arrested Hong Kong Chinese.
   The arrests were likely to increase Hong Kong fears about
Chinese rule, which already have sent many in search of haven
elsewhere.

   On Dec. 25, 1989, the trial of Nicolae Ceausescu and Elena
Ceausescu was held before an extraordinary military tribunal. The
charges were:
   1. Genocide. More than 60,000 victims.
   2. Undermining of the state power through organization of armed
actions against the people and the state power.
   3. Destruction of public property through destruction and
damaging of buildings and numerous explosions in cities, etc.
   4. The undermining of the national economy.
   5. The attempt to flee the country by taking advantage of more
than $1 billion deposited in foreign banks.
   For these crimes against the Romanian people and Romania, the
culprits Nicolae Ceausescu and Elena Ceausescu were condemned to
death and the confiscation of their wealth.
   The sentence was definitive and was carried out.

   Charles Hunter accepted his teacher's
semester challenge, and last week he carried it to school: numbers
from one to 1 million listed on 2,400 pages and weighing 50 pounds.
   The project began after Steve Randak, who teaches a biology
class for gifted students at Lafayette Jefferson High School, told
the class he would give an A for the semester to anyone who wrote
out every number from one to a million.
   Unfortunately, Hunter didn't qualify for the A because he
generated the numbers on his home computer.
   ``I just thought it would be really neat to show someone could
do it and to prove how large a million is,'' said Hunter, who is
earning an A in the course anyway.
   Hunter said he first set out to write each number by hand, but
lost interest at about 5,000.
   His interest was renewed when he thought of printing the numbers
by computer. He ran the program at least seven hours a day for two
weeks. After 2{ boxes of computer paper and three ink cartridges,
he reached the magic number.

   Harvard University may profess to be
striving to combat its image as a citadel of the privileged.
Sometimes, however, the Harvard of old, when titled and untitled
royalty paced the ivied campus, peeps through the modern curtain.
   In a new questionnaire, the school asks its graduates to own up
to their proper title. For alumni not content with Mr., Miss, Mrs.
or Ms., Harvard offers 43 other choices.
   Admiral? General? Baron? Contess? Chief Justice? The Right
Honorable Lord? The Most Reverend Archbishop? His Royal Highness?
Please check all that apply.
   But some titles were left out _ such as president.
   President Bush went to Harvard's archrival, Yale.
   The president of the Harvard Alumni Association, Charles J. Egan
Jr., said there was nothing unusual about the survey.
   ``It's like the census. It's the same principle, when you're
trying to determine exactly who is in that population,'' said Egan,
who signed a letter accompanying the survey urging alumni to fill
it out.
   Egan said at least four chief justices of the Massachusetts
Supreme Court were graduates of Harvard Law School. He said he
could think of at least two alumni who bore the title ``His royal
highness.''
   Harvard spokeswoman Barbara Welanetz said the university has
many illustrious alumni, but she wondered whether the survey used
the right tone.
   ``Perhaps it was not as well thought through as it might have
been,'' she said.
   The information is to be compiled in a two-volume, $85 directory
of Harvard's 200,000-plus graduates.

   A Western Michigan University professor
is trying to encourage serious research on extraterrestrials by
reviving a professional journal.
   The Journal of UFO Studies, resurrected this year from a defunct
publication of the same name, aims to give researchers something
``they wouldn't be embarrassed by writing for,'' said its editor,
Michael Swords.
   ``It's meant to allow the serious people to have an outlet,
which doesn't really exist right now. This was a hole in UFO
publishing that had to be filled,'' the professor of natural
sciences said recently.
   Swords, who is working on the second annual issue, said the $15
journal, with a circulation of about 700, is too technical for the
general public.
   For example, one of the first issue's three articles of about 35
pages each discussed chemical analyses of a substance gleaned from
the Delphos Case, a supposed 1971 UFO landing site in Kansas.
Another looked at the effect of hypnosis in obtaining information
from people who claim they have been abducted by aliens.
   Swords wrote a third article, about whether other life exists in
the universe. He said it isn't a matter of if, but of how many.
   ``All the laws of nature are the same everywhere, and what
happens once is bound to happen twice. Chances of other high-tech
extraterrestrial civilizations are equal to how long it could exist
after reaching the danger zone of technology.
   ``Since we're made it 45 years past nuclear weapons, I think
people think there are at least dozens if not thousands of
high-tech civilizations out there,'' Swords said.

<HEAD>Sprinklers Had Been Planned for Retirement Home Where 16 Died</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Owners of a high-rise retirement home
where a Christmas Eve fire killed 16 people had planned to install
a sprinkler system in the spring, the manager says.
   ``We didn't feel uncomfortable with the safety of the building.
We just had seen fires, basically on TV and other places. The
comment was made that the sprinkler system would have been a
benefit,'' Grant Trivett of M&amp;M Properties, which manages the John
Sevier Retirement Center, said Monday night.
   Trivett says the John Sevier Partnership, which owns the
11-story building, was going to have sprinklers put in at a cost of
$100,000.
   The 5-decade-old building did have water hoses on each floor and
met the fire code in effect in 1977, when it was converted from a
hotel into apartments for retirees, according to Lt. George
Leonard, fire marshal for this eastern Tennessee city of 40,000.
   He said the current fire code requires sprinklers for buildings
undergoing renovations.
   ``We inherit these buildings,'' Leonard said. ``They're no more
dangerous, it just means they don't meet the present codes ...
Legally they don't have to.''
   The fire broke out Sunday evening on the first or second floor
of the building, where about 145 people lived, and sent thick smoke
billowing through the upper floors. Officials said the deaths
occurred on the upper floors, probably because of smoke inhalation.
About 50 people were injured, including about 15 firefighters.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but Leonard said
it appeared accidental.
   In October, a resident of the home died when a kerosene heater,
apparently mistakenly filled with gasoline, ignited his apartment.
   After that fire, Assistant Fire Chief Paul Souder said, he
stepped up pressure on the owners to install sprinklers.
   ``I feel like if a building is sprinkled and if the sprinkler is
working properly then we wouldn't have had life loss,'' said
Leonard.
   Sunday's disaster might have been worse had so many residents
not been away for Christmas, said Mayor P.C. Snapp.
   ``I can't think of a worse time, on Christmas Eve,'' Snapp said.
``On the other hand, it could have been a good time because a
number of people had gone to visit relatives.''
   Fourteen victims lived in the building and the two others were
visiting residents.
   Residents of upper floors waved flashlights and screamed for
help from the windows of their smoke-filled apartments.
   ``We could hear some people over there screaming, `We can't hold
out much longer!' then all at once we didn't hear them anymore,''
said Alex Hambric, whose 77-year-old mother was rescued from her
ninth-floor apartment.
   Up to 250 firefighters fought the blaze, which took about nearly
seven hours to control. Some of them suffered frostbite.
   Most of the injured were treated for smoke inhalation and
released. At least one person was seriously burned, said Dan
Blevins, spokesman for Northside Hospital.
   Ten of 11 residents who had been listed as missing Monday have
been accounted for. The 11th person is believed to have been away
at the time.
   The fire marshal said he didn't know if owners plan to renovate
the building or tear it down. He said it appeared to be
structurally sound.
   Trivett, the building manager, said, ``If it's renovated, it
will be renovated to today's codes.''

   A man found out the hard way it's not easy
to return a pretty pink radio bought mistakenly as a Christmas
present for a roofer.
   Kenneth R. Slate, 45, began Christmas Day in jail after being
arrested Sunday night while trying to exchange the radio for one

   ``I got this radio for a roofer and he wouldn't want a pink
radio,'' Slate told police.
   After he opened the box and discovered the color, Slate returned
to the store. But a guard blocked his entrance, saying the store
was closing.
   As Slate persisted, the guard warned him he could be arrested.
With that, police reports say, Slate extended his arms and told the
guard to lock him up. The guard did.
   Authorities said Slate faces misdemeanor charges of criminal
trespass and disorderly conduct. He was being held on $1,000 bond.

   Facing an uncertain future, thousands of
people left homeless by the firepower of the U.S. troops who ousted
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega lined up at a refugee camp for a
Christmas dinner of GI rations.
   President Guillermo Endara and his vice presidents, Ricardo
Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford, visited the camp Monday for a
Mass celebrated by Archbishop Marcos McGrath five days after the
U.S. invasion.
   Residents swarmed around them, shouting ``Viva Endara!'' and
``Long live the civilian government!'' Endara won May elections
that Noriega annulled.
   Christmas dinners were served in makeshift plastic shelters and
large U.S. Army tents.
   ``We served more than 8,000 meals last night,'' Army Col.
William Connolly said Monday. ``The lines were longer than we or
they would have liked.''
   Many of the refugees, their arms and legs in casts or bandages,
quietly wondered what would happen to them now. They lost their
homes in fighting between Noriega supporters and U.S. forces that
attacked Wednesday to oust the military ruler.
   ``Well, you know, it's a place to stay meanwhile,'' said Pilab
Rios, 40, a store clerk. ``It is safe here and there is food. Of
course I am sad to have my home gone at Christmas, but I have my
life and they say we will leave here in a few weeks.''
   The camp is at Balboa Stadium and High School, just south of
Panama City in the former Canal Zone near the canal administration
building. The U.S. Army has erected 14 large tents and hopes to put
up 14 more.
   Many of the homeless have patched together shelter from what was
available.
   ``There are between 9,000 and 10,000 people here but you don't
see that many now,'' said Connolly, a Boston native.
   ``A lot of them leave during the day to where their homes were
and search for any belongings they can bring back here,'' he said.
``They come back in the evenings. We can estimate the population by
the number of meals we serve.''
   For many, the clothes they have on are all they managed to save.
   The camp is clean and orderly, and Connolly said it has
extensive medical facilities.
   Both the troops and the homeless consider it fortunate that now
is the start of the dry season in Panama, with no torrential rains
expected.
   Organization of the camp has been turned over to Sergio Galvez,
mayor of the Chorrillo district that surrounded Noriega's
Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters. The district was devastated
in the U.S. attack, and most of the camp residents came from there.
   ``I have been talking with presidential advisers and they are
very willing to help rebuild,'' Galvez said. ``We all want to go
back to Chorrillo. We hope the government of President Endara will
solve this problem very quickly.''
   Army Col. Jack Pryor said officials of the U.S. Agency for
International Development are looking into an urban reconstruction
program for Chorrillo.
   Galvez divided the camp into six sectors, based on people's
neighborhoods before their homes were destroyed in the fighting.
   The homeless form orderly lines for Army rations. A few cooked
rice or other staples over small fires. One family opened a small
store with a few cans of food.

   When a fire early one morning claimed the
lives of their three young boys, Dubby and Diana Wilcox made a
bittersweet choice. They donated their boys' organs for transplant
operations.
   Two days later, the heart of 10-year-old Jared Wilcox was
beating in the body of a 48-year-old woman in Arkansas' first heart
transplant.
   The livers of Jared and his 9-year-old brother, Jake, were
transplanted into the bodies of a 14-year-old Pennsylvania boy and
a 33-year-old North Carolina woman.
   And the boys' kidneys went to four Arkansas residents.
   Those who know the Wilcoxes said their decision was typical of
their unselfishness. As word of the tragedy spread, friends,
neighbors and even strangers responded to give to them.
   In a few hours, a radio station's plea for help generated
thousands of dollars. A restaurant planned a benefit dinner, church
groups provided food, children collected pennies and employees of a
grocery chain authorized payroll deductions.
   Others in Bald Knob, a town of 2,700 residents about 60 miles
northeast of Little Rock, contributed clothing, furniture,
appliances, vehicles, utilities and even a house, provided
rent-free for the next year and renovated in a day's time by dozens
of volunteers.
   Diana Wilcox smiled, then cried as she recalled entering the
home for the first time.
   ``You couldn't move,'' she said. ``There were people lined up
all along the walls. And they all hollered, `Welcome home.'''
   The three Wilcox children were sleeping in their beds the
morning of Nov. 8 while Mrs. Wilcox drove her husband to work just
a few blocks away. In those few minutes, the house was engulfed in
smoke, the result of what Police Chief Dave Miller said was a short
circuit.
   Five-year-old Justin died of smoke inhalation that morning.
Jared and Jake died the following day, also of smoke inhalation.
   When first approached about donating their sons' organs, the
Wilcoxes said no. Minutes later, after considering what they
thought the boys would have wanted, they changed their minds.
   Mrs. Wilcox said the knowledge that her children saved lives is
comforting.
   ``There's people that've got loved ones because of my boys,''
she said.
   The transplant of Jared's heart to Mary E. Wilson of
Jacksonville allowed her to celebrate Christmas with her family.
She said Monday she hoped to meet Jared's parents.
   ``I feel that it was a gift from that family, a gift of life
from that family,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``I'm really anxious to get to
know them. I just feel like I'm part of their family now.''
   The Wilcoxes' generosity also has helped others who need an
organ transplant, said Bobby Cumberland, executive director of the
Arkansas Regional Organ Recovery Agency in Little Rock.
   ``We had more organ donor referrals in November than in any
month in our history, and I think a large part of that is due to
this family's decision to tell their story,'' he said.
   Their story has touched people around the country. The couple
received about 3,000 letters. Donations have swelled to more than
$20,000.
   Alan Risener of radio station KWCK in nearby Searcy called the
response to the station's on-air request for donations unbelievable.
   ``Within a few minutes, we had $500,'' he said. ``Within three
hours, we had $6,000, and it just continued to climb.''
   A teary-eyed elderly woman walked in the station's door with a
$100 donation. Students from nearby Harding University carried in
jugs of nickels, dimes and quarters. One man who doesn't drive
arranged a ride 15 miles into town to donate $1.
   After the boys died, friends of the Wilcoxes feared the couple
might leave Bald Knob, particularly since they had no home.
   ``I didn't want them leaving,'' Jimmy Harper said. ``I felt that
if they left, it would have been a big loss in the community. Our
youth program wouldn't be the same without Dubby.''
   Harper said a small group of friends decided to take on
renovation of the house offered by real estate agents Lynn and
Verla Davis. More than 50 people showed up to help.
   The house was little more than a shell. But in nine hours,
volunteers installed electrical wiring, plumbing, a septic tank,
the water line, a heating unit, appliances and bathroom fixtures.
Utilities were turned on, and Simms Gas Co. of Searcy filled up the
fuel tank, leaving behind a ticket that said ``No charge.''
   The workers cleaned, painted, hung curtains and stocked the
pantry and medicine chest. And to make the house a home, volunteers
decorated the walls with items from their own walls.
   ``This is the closest to home right now we can get,'' Mrs.
Wilcox said.
   ``You don't realize how many friends you have 'til something
like this happens,'' Wilcox added.

   The century-old Tournament of Roses
Parade takes to the streets New Year's Day with millions of
flowers, amazing floats and some of the world's most distinguished
marching bands.
   Then there's a group of Indonesian musicians who just months ago
couldn't play trumpets and trombones.
   The 140-member Sampoerna Band Indonesia will be its country's
first representatives in Monday's parade, tournament officials said.
   The band has been practicing furiously.
   Even their director, Thom Jenkins, didn't know at first if
they'd be ready. Now, he said, they are.
   ``They really have worked extremely hard,'' Jenkins said during
a recent telephone interview from Surabaya, the Indonesian city of
4 million people in East Java where the band is based.
   ``Marching band instruments are not their native instruments, so
when we started they didn't even know what a trumpet was supposed
to sound like,'' he said.
   He has drilled the musicians, two-thirds of whom are women, for
40 hours a week for 11 months. The band also has marched and
marched and marched, three to four miles a day in the Indonesian
heat.
   Jenkins, who moved from Atlanta to Indonesia early this year to
work with the band, said the ensemble submitted an audition tape to
tournament officials because ``we wanted to shoot for the top.''
   ``Even over here the Rose Parade is known as the world's
premiere parade.''
   When they learned of their acceptance, Jenkins said they were
thrilled. ``I wish you could have seen their faces,'' he said.
   The Indonesians, who range from age 16 to 42, will join elite
company.
   They will be among the 22 bands, 60 floats and 29 equestrian
units that an estimated 1 million people are expected to turn out
to see. Millions more will watch on television.
   The band will march amid such high-technology floats as the
General Motors-United Auto Workers entry, which is a 33-foot-long
land vehicle of the future that converts into a 60-foot-tall robot
in seconds, and the city of Burbank's entry _ a 55-foot-long
``Be-Bop Malt Shop'' that pays tribute to '50s rock music and
nostalgia with a giant juke box and roller-skating waitresses.
   Other parade veterans are the Marine Corps and Salvation Army
units, as well as aggregations from Japan and Switzerland. The
University of Southern California and Michigan bands will be
high-stepping in the parade hours before the two schools' football
teams play in the annual Rose Bowl game.
   If they hadn't passed the audition, they would have tried again
next year, Jenkins said.
   But the group was ready, said Mike Riffey, chairman of the
Tournament of Roses music committee.
   ``They looked very good,'' he said. ``They're a very good band.''
   For the band members, the parade promises to be only one
highlight of the trip.
   Most get around Surabaya by bicycle or scooter and live very
modestly, Jenkins said. Only one band member has been outside the
country before, and Riffey said one person expressed concern about
where band members would bathe in an area with so few rivers as
Southern California.
   She was told about indoor showers, he said.
   The group's members are looking forward to sampling their first
American hamburgers, visiting Disneyland and Hollywood and going
skiing, Jenkins said.
   That latter experience might provide the greatest culture shock
of all, he said.
   ``These guys put on coats when the temperature falls to 80,'' he
said. ``Indonesia is on the equator and the temperature is usually
90 to 100.''
   But whatever the weather, the band is ready to play its
repertoire of Indonesian marching tuns and folk, pop and patriotic
songs, all of which work surprisingly well as marching music,
Jenkins said.
   ``They're very proud to be representing their country,'' Jenkins
said. ``Indonesia is a young country and patriotism is not
considered corny.''

<HEAD>A Bridge-Building Material Comes to the Fore _ Wood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW SCOTLAND, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With thousands of its bridges in need
of repairs, New York is turning to a building material that's
strong and durable, relatively cheap, easy to work with and
pleasant to look at.
   It's wood.
   Far from being a way to cut corners, engineers say wood is in
many respects better than the traditional steel and concrete in the
kind of short, lightly traveled, rural bridges most in need of
repair.
   ``Using wood is really our best shot at building the
longest-lasting bridge with minimal maintenance,'' said Stan
Bishop, a road engineer for Cattaraugus County, in western New
York. Nearly a fifth of the 270 bridges maintained by the county
have some wood.
   The issue is significant in New York, because the state is faced
with billions of dollars in repair costs for 7,650 state- and
locally-owned spans that aren't up to standards.
   The deficiencies were discovered after a bridge on the New York
State Thruway collapsed in April 1987 in an accident that claimed
10 lives.
   If properly pressure-treated and preserved, wood is virtually
impervious to the enemy that rots out conventional
steel-and-concrete bridges _ road salt _ said William Smith, a
professor of wood products engineering at the State University of
New York in Syracuse.
   ``There's no reason wood shouldn't last 50 or 100 years or more
from a strength and durability standpoint,'' Smith said.
   Steel and concrete bridges, on the other hand, can show serious
deterioration after just 10 or 12 years on roads that are heavily
salted in the winter, Bishop said.
   Proponents of wood point to covered bridges, some of which more
than a century old, as evidence of the longevity of wooden spans.
Some elm pilings examined when the London Bridge was dismantled and
shipped to the United States as a tourist attraction had been in
service for 400 years.
   The cost savings achieved by using wood can vary considerably,
according to the length of the span, design, location, and other
factors, said Thomas Quinn, a structural engineer with the New York
state Department of Transportation. Costs can drop 20 percent or
more when wood is used instead of concrete and steel for a bridge's
superstructure, Quinn said.
   Paul Cooney, an engineer for Albany County, said many road
workers prefer working with wood to concrete.
   ``Workers tend to have more of a familiarity with wood, they
feel more comfortable with it,'' Cooney said. ``Instead of hiring
expert welders and elaborate equipment you don't have in normal
inventory, with the wood you have workers drilling holes, attaching
bolts and using tools and equipment they're used to.''
   Despite the potential cost savings, timber is seldom used in
bridges around the country, said Clellon Lovall, chief engineer in
Tennessee's transportation department and chairman of the
subcommittee on bridges and structures for the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
   Wood has probably become attractive to New York highway
officials, he said, because it sometimes costs two or three times
more to build a bridge in New York than in other states due to high
labor, contracting and material expenses.
   ``It is limited in strength and connection capabilities,'' said
T.Y. Lin, founder and honorary board chairman of the T.Y. Lin
International engineering firm in San Francisco. ``However, there
are certainly places where it can be profitably or economically
used.''
   Generally, timber bridge experts say wood should be used only in
spans shorter than 50 feet.
   There are other potential drawbacks: beams can split, especially
under high pressure, and once that happens they must be replaced.
Wood can shrink and swell in varying moisture and temperature
conditions, possibly causing weaknesses in footings.
   In New York, wood is most often used in construction of the
superstructure _ that portion of the bridge placed atop pilings to
support the deck _ or to build the deck itself. In
steel-and-concrete spans, both parts are highly susceptible to
corrosion due to road salt and rust.

<HEAD>Americans Share Holiday Cheer With Those in Need</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took time out from family celebrations to bring
Christmas cheer to the unfortunate, sorting cards for GIs in
Panama, staffing soup kitchens and even giving up their own feasts
when thieves took food destined for the needy.
   In military towns such as Ft. Bragg, N.C., families prayed for
loved ones fighting in the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Shirley Kinney and her two teen-age children celebrated almost
as usual _ but left unopened under the tree presents for Master
Sgt. Walter Kinney, an intelligence officer among the 4,000-person
contingent sent from Ft. Bragg.
   ``I just hope and pray he'll be safe over there,'' said Mrs.
Kinney, 40, who wore a symbolic yellow ribbon on her lapel next to
the Santa Claus pin.
   Wounded soldiers at Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio
exchanged presents with relatives in special visiting rooms, said
Staff Sgt. Rey Adame, a hospital spokesman. Residents volunteered
to help sort gifts, cards and letters sent to the GIs injured in
Panama.
   For many Americans, it was a day for church services or quiet
personal celebration of the birth of Jesus. But many extended
gift-giving beyond their families, sharing with the less fortunate.
   In Atlanta, some homeless people dined on pizza instead of
turkey and ham after thieves stole 400 turkeys and thousands of
dollars worth of food and toys collected for a Christmas meal.
   Then, when word got out of the theft, Atlantans nearly
overwhelmed the Georgia World Congress Center with traditional
holiday fare, much of it apparently destined for their own tables,
said attorney Neal Boortz, one of the organizers.
   ``We told the people that we needed some more turkey, some more
ham, and people at home today are taking the turkey and the ham
they were going to eat and were putting it in boxes and bags and
bringing it to us,'' Boortz said. ``They were looking in their
cabinets for some canned goods and were making themselves some
spaghetti or something.''
   Organizers estimated that 20,000 people showed up.
   ``This is the helping spirit of Kwanzaa, Christmas and Hanukkah
all wrapped into one,'' said Dr. James Scott, a volunteer on the
food line. Kwanzaa is an African-American celebration.
   Chicago's Paul Hall Center, also hit by theft of thousands of
dollars worth of food intended for Christmas Eve dinner for 1,500
needy people, was back in business Christmas Day, bolstered by
donations from city residents.
   About 100 volunteers turned up at the Midnight Mission on Skid
Row in Los Angeles to help serve meals of turkey, yams and pumpkin
pie to the homeless.
   ``This gives me perspective,'' Clint Hodges, a 52-year-old
attorney, wearing a white cap and apron.
   President and Mrs. Bush spent the holiday with their five
children and 11 grandchildren at Camp David, in Maryland's
snow-covered Catoctin mountains, but weren't out of reach of the
day's events.
   Bush invited National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to brief
him on the situations in Panama and Romania.
   In Manhattan Beach, Calif., 19-year-old Ryan Flaherty made it
home for Christmas with a present from his doctors _ a transplanted
heart that saved his life.
   Flaherty, who suffered from a congenital heart defect, had the
transplant Dec. 14 at the University of California, Los Angeles,
Medical Center.
   His second-biggest present was a bass guitar, said his mother,
Karen.
   For the 10th year, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. invited about 900 senior
citizens invited to its headquarters in New York to make free
long-distance telephone calls to loved ones.
   One family in Lake Bluff, Ill., celebrated an anniversary as
well as a holiday.
   The children of the advertising copywriter who created Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer 50 years ago for a Montgomery Ward's
promotion booklet said they are grateful year-round for the
residual payments from the mythical sleigh-puller.
   The writer's daughter, Elizabeth Decker of Lake Bluff, Ill.,
says that every Christmas season her late father, Robert May, used
to look out the window at a statue of the reindeer and say ``Thank
you, Rudolph.''

   Ion Iliescu, Romania's new president, is
a former senior Communist official who was demoted for standing up
to Nicolae Ceausescu and is said to be a close friend of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Ceausescu had stripped Iliescu of the prestigious post of party
secretary and had him assigned to direct a publishing house.
   Iliescu, 59, announced on television Friday the formation of the
National Salvation Committee, which he described as the ``new organ
of state power'' in Romania. On Saturday, he announced Ceausescu's
arrest.
   Today, Iliescu was appointed president by the provisional
government.
   He holds a university degree in business administration and also
studied hydrology at Moscow University, where knowledgeable
Romanians say he got to know Gorbachev.
   While originally one of Ceausescu's close aides in the late
1960s as the man responsible for youth problems and propaganda, he
was demoted from the Central Committee in 1971 and later from the
Cabinet.
   He became regional party secretary in Timisoara, western
Roamania, and in Iasi, near the Soviet border, in the early 1970s
and was summoned to Bucharest and named chairman of a council for
water administration.
   Fired from that job after a sharp exchange with Ceausescu and
the dictator's wife, Elena, at a party meeting in the mid-1980s,
Iliescu was named director of the Editura Tehnica publishing house.
   His reported friendly ties with Gorbachev saved him from a more
dramatic fall, informed sources said.
   ``Iliescu, as a local party chief, was very informal. He never
used the word `comrade' when addressing people and was ready to
talk to them as soon as they knocked at his door,'' said Cornelia
Dimitriu, a university professor in Iasi, where Iliescu was sent in
1974 to serve as regional party secretary.
   ``He couldn't stand Ceausescu's personality cult and he did not
refrain like others from expressing it,'' she said in an interview.
``He often did not obey the orders he received from Bucharest.''
   ``Iliescu fell out of favor with Ceausescu because he was
outspoken and frequently aired his grievances. He is a technocrat
and not an ideologist,'' Ms. Dimitriu said.
   Born in 1930 into a worker's family in eastern Romania, Iliescu,
who is married but has no children, held a number of Central
Committee jobs throughout the 1960s, enabling him to work his way
up through the Communist Party.
   At one point he headed the Central Committee's Department of
Propaganda, and from 1967 to 1971 he was Minister of Youth Problems.
   Iliescu, long rumored to be a possible successor to Ceausescu,
did not sign a March 1989 letter to the former Romanian leader that
protested the dictator's human rights violations and his despotic
rule.
   Informed Romanians said it might have jeopardized Iliescu had he
openly joined them, preferring to appear unblemished in the eyes of
Ceausescu, whose secret police reportedly kept close tabs on his
private life.
   ``He obviously managed to outfox them,'' Mircea Stoica, a former
professor at Bucharest University said.
   Iliescu stated Friday that the new government would establish
``a new structure of political power.''
   ``The old structure of party and government was liquidated,''
Iliescu said, possibly indicating the demise of Ceausescu's
Communist Party in Romania.
   ``We will establish a provisional structure which will prepare
free elections (in April) in which the people will be the decisive
factor for pur public life, Iliescu said.

<HEAD>Colorful Las Vegas Gaming Pioneer Benny Binion Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gaming pioneer Benny Binion, who started out
running illegal craps games and parlayed his fortunes to become
owner of one of Nevada's big-time casinos, has died. He was 85.
   Binion died Monday at Valley Hospital of a heart-related
condition, according to a statement by Henri Bollinger Public
Relations of Los Angeles. He had a history of heart problems and
entered the hospital several days ago for observation.
   ``I'd asked the doctors in gamblers' terms what were his odds,
and they told me six or eight to one against him,'' said his son,
Jack Binion. ``This morning I could see he wasn't going to make
it.''
   He said his father, who owned the Horsehoe casino, had been
given the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church on Friday.
   Benny Binion was born in Grayson County, Texas, to a family that
sold race horses on the county fair circuit, a connection that
provided his entry into the gambling world.
   He started out running illegal craps games, usually out of hotel
rooms.
   ``The craps table would have legs that folded down and it fit
into a crate that looked like a bed crate, and since hotels always
had beds going in or out, if you had 30 minutes notice that you
were going to be raided, you could clean the place out,'' he once
recalled.
   He was said to have killed two people in gunfights during those
days, but never went to prison for them, with the charges dropped
in each case. He never apologized for them either, once saying,
``Tough times make tough people.''
   He did serve time in prison for selling liquor during
Prohibition and for income tax evasion in the 1950s. But toward the
end of his life he had become such a friend of law enforcement that
police officers borrowed money from his casino to make major
undercover drug buys.
   Binion moved to Las Vegas in 1946 and bought the Horseshoe five
years later, quickly building it into one of the city's premiere
attractions.
   ``I was around it and just drifted into it,'' he once said.
   Among the gaming memorabilia featured at the club are $1 million
worth of $10,000 bills.
   The club, also known for its million-dollar craps table bets and
its annual $10,000 buy-in World Series of Poker tournament, now
occupies a city block.
   In addition to his wife, Teddy Jane, and son, surviors include
two daughters, Brenda Michael and Beckey Behnen, another son, Ted.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Advanced-technology ``stealth''
jets slipped through Panamanian air defenses and dropped two
2,000-pound bombs on a military base in the early hours of the U.S.
invasion, said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Cheney told a Monday news conference in Panama that the raid
before dawn Wednesday was intended to ``stun and disorient'' the
Panamanian Defense Forces at Rio Hato before airborne troops were
dropped there.
   The troops attacked an officers' school and base of the Machos
de Monte battalion, one of deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
crack units.
   The raid, first reported by a Pentagon spokesman on Saturday,
was the first combat use of the F-117A fighter jet that employs
``stealth'' technology designed to elude radar. To date, the
super-secret fighter built by the Lockheed Corp. has been kept from
public viewing, with a squadron based in Nevada.
   A photograph of the plane released by the Pentagon last year
depicts a relatively small swept-wing plane with a flat underbelly.
From some angles it looks like a stingray. Stealth technology makes
extensive use of exotic composite materials, some of which absorb
rather than reflect radar waves, and avoids sharp surface angles.
   Cheney refused to elaborate on negotiations over Noriega, who is
wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges. Noriega
sought refuge Sunday in the Vatican Embassy.
   ``It is U.S. policy that we would like to see Noriega brought
for trial,'' he said, adding that the military's role in the hunt
for the general had ended and ``now it is up to diplomats and
lawyers.''
   Cheney said he met with President Guillermo Endara and vice
presidents Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford and was
``tremendously impressed with their determination to get the
government of Panama back on its feet.''
   He would not say what they talked about.
   Cheney also said U.S. troops had discovered a larger supply of
Cuban weapons in Panama than they did during the American invasion
of Grenada six years ago.
   ``It is sure far more weaponry was found than Mr. Noriega could
conceivably use even if he armed his forces several times over,''
Cheney said. ``I'm not sure what the purpose of this is.''
   Cheney said additional troops sent for the invasion ``will stay
as long as they are needed. ... We don't want to leave too soon
before the objective has been achieved.''
   Cheney noted that the United States does not turn over the
Panama Canal for 10 more years and said, ``There were troops here
before so there will continue to be a U.S. military presence for
the near future.
   The defense secretary visited troops earlier Monday and called
the invasion ``the most surgical operation of its size ever carried
out, not only by our forces but by anybody else's forces.''

   A judge wounded by a mailed pipe bomb was
released from a hospital and was working with investigators draw up
a list of possible suspects.
   Judge John P. Corderman who lost part of a finger and suffered
ruptured eardrums and other injuries, was released Monday afternoon
from Washington County Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Sheran
White. His hearing has improved, but doctors hadn't decided if he
will need surgery later, she said.
   U.S. Postal Service investigators were running down ``numerous,
significant leads,'' to Friday's bombing at the judge's apartment,
said Inspector Thomas W. McClure.
   Investigators working with the 47-year-old Washington County
Circuit judge began drawing up a list of people ``with an ax to
grind'' against him, said Hagerstown police Cpl. Michael Small.
   Federal investigators have all but ruled out a connection
between the Hagerstown bombing and mailed pipe bombs in the last 10
days that killed a federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., and a
Savannah, Ga., attorney who handled civil-rights cases.
   Two other bombs connected with that series of attacks have been
disarmed, one at the federal appeals court in Atlanta and one at
the offices of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Corderman was active in the effort to pass a law restricting
handguns in Maryland and recently joined the board of a national
group opposed to handgun proliferation.
   He also has angered social clubs in Washington County by
prompting a crackdown on gambling. In 1981, the judge and his
family were given police protection when an anonymous threat
followed a decision on gambling in the private clubs.

   Soldiers wounded in Panama, wearing Purple
Hearts on their pajamas, enjoyed Christmas visits with relatives
and celebrated the news that Gen. Manuel Noriega turned himself in.
   ``I feel glad that the beast is in chains,'' Staff Sgt. Terence
Merlo said Monday during a visit to Wilford Hall Medical Center by
Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone.
   Merlo, who is in the military police, said he wished the man who
had run Panama had turned up somewhere other than in the Vatican
Embassy, where he requested asylum Sunday.
   ``I'm not sure that it was the best place for him to turn
himself in for us to get gratification and achieve our ends,'' said
Merlo, who suffered at least four gunshot wounds to the abdomen and
a nick on the temple.
   Stone visited wards stacked with Christmas presents and full of
visiting relatives at Wilford Hall and Brook Army Medical Center,
where more than 80 servicemen were being treated.
   ``We have been vigilant in our defense of our values and the
threat to the national interest. But vigilance has its price,''
Stone said after the visit. ``We honor the soldiers for their
patriotism, bravery and courage.''
   As he made his way around hospital rooms, giving Army medallions
as gifts, Stone heard firsthand about the fighting.
   Merlo, 40, with his wife, daughters and other relatives at his
side, said he and MP Spec. Robert Cuschleg of Columbus, Ohio, were
ambushed in the darkness during the first day of the U.S. attack.
Cuschleg, in the next bed, had a finger amputated because of an
injury.
   Pfc. Mike Heyne, 21, of Ashland, Ohio, also at Wilford Hall,
said he hoped Noriega's surrender would allow American troops to
come home soon.
   ``I'm glad he did it this early,'' said Heyne, who was wounded
by mortar fire. A small jar containing some shrapnel doctors
removed from his waist sat next to his bed, and Heyne said he
planned to keep it as a souvenir.
   First Sgt. Jose Western, 31, recovering at Brooke, also
expressed delight that Noriega's whereabouts were finally known.
   ``I'm glad Noriega surrendered. It doesn't matter where he is,
as long as he surrendered,'' said Western, of Fort Ord, Calif.
   So far 250 soldiers, including 15 on Monday, have been brought
to San Antonio after being wounded in Panama. Three died en route
and one died after arrival.
   Dozens have been transferred back to home bases or discharged,
leaving 52 at Wilford Hall and 34 at Brooke Army Medical Center.
   On Christmas morning, soldiers read newspapers reporting
Noriega's surrender and displayed Purple Hearts from their pillows
or pajamas.
   Relatives exchanged gifts with the soldiers and some attended
two Christmas Day services as they stayed at the hospitals with
their wounded loved ones.

<HEAD>Vatican: Violence In Panama Should End After Noreiga Sought Asylum</HEAD>

   The Vatican avoided a quick decision on what
to do with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but said fighting in Panama
would likely end now that the ousted strongman has taken refuge in
its embassy in Panama City.
   In the Vatican's first official statement since Noriega sought
refuge in the embassy on Sunday, spokesman Joaquin Navarro said
Monday that the ``concerned parties'' would examine Noriega's case.
   Navarro said one of the parties was the government of Guillermo
Endara, installed after the U.S. forces invaded. He declined to
elaborate on the others.
   He said it was premature to say whether Noriega would be turned
over to the United States, where he is wanted on drug charges, or
given passage to another country, although reports from Panama
mentioned the possibility of Noriega going to Spain or Cuba.
   In Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
was quoted as saying Monday that asylum for Noriega was the
exclusive problem of the Vatican, the United States and the new
Panamanian government.
   In comments to EFE, Spain's national news agency, Fernandez
Ordonez was quoted as saying, ``Spain is not the ideal country to
accept Noriega because of its extradition agreement with the United
States, which includes drug trafficking (cases).''
   Navarro was asked by Italian state TV, if a ``simple'' turnover
of Noriega to the United States was foreseeable.
   ``Well, I don't think so,'' said Navarro. ``There isn't an
extradition treaty or anything.''
   Earlier, another Vatican official said he doubted the Vatican
would hand Noriega over directly to the government of an invading
army and suggested the Vatican could hand him over to the new
Panamanian government on condition of a fair trial.
   The Vatican depicted the situation as an opportunity to bring
peace to the Central American country and indicated it knew of
Noriega's position before he showed up Sunday afternoon.
   ``I can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in Panama
seems to be nearing a solution without further shedding of blood,''
Navarro said in a four-paragraph statement. ``And this is good news
for Christmas Day.''
   ``Concerning the situation of Gen. Noriega in particular, I can
confirm that at this moment he is in the Apostolic Nunciature in
Panama City, after having expressed the will to end the conflict.''
   Asked about any negotiations or discussions preceeding Noriega's
arrival at the embassy, Navarro declined to respond.
   There have been previous cases of people seeking refuge at
Vatican embassies, including Endara. The embassy in Panama
sheltered him for a month after he was beaten by Noriega's soldiers.
   Navarro said Pope John Paul II was informed of the Noriega case
Sunday evening before going to St. Peter's Basilica to say
Christmas midnight Mass. The pope made no direct mention of Panama
in his Christmas address.

   Michigan and Wisconsin braced for heavy snow and the Deep South
shivered early today, but much of the nation basked in a winter
break from an arctic front.
   In Michigan, a cold front produced squalls with heavy snow
Christmas night and early today. Wakefield received 10 inches of
snow, Ironwood had 6 inches and Marquette measured 5 inches.
   In northwest Wisconsin, forecasters predicted up to a foot of
snow tonight. Strong winds also were expected for all five of the
Great Lakes, where gale warnings were in effect.
   A warm front, meanwhile, produced scattered snow showers late
Monday from Tennessee and the Ohio Valley to New York and the
middle Atlantic coast region.
   Among the cities getting fresh snow this morning were
Louisville, Ky., Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit,
Albany, N.Y., and Portland, Maine.
   Monday's storm produced enough new snow at Erie, Pa., to push
their snowfall total for the month past the previous December
record of 59.9 inches set in 1985.
   It was a cold Christmas day in Florida. Afternoon highs across
the state were 44 to 56 degrees, following morning lows which
dipped to 17 at Crestview and Tallahassee.
   The cold continued today in the South, with freezing
temperatures this morning in Jacksonville, Fla., Macon, Ga., and
Atlanta.
   Parts of California also were cold on Monday. The high
temperature Monday at Bakersfield was 38 degrees, a record for the
coldest high on the date.
   Temperatures warmed into the 50s in the central Plains and the
lower Mississippi Valley.
   The hot spot in the nation Monday was the Southern California
town of San Juan Capistrano, with a high of 84 degrees.
   The nation's coldest spot was Milo, Maine, at 22 degrees below
zero.
   Record lows for Christmas Day: Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 29
degrees; Key West Fla., 46; Miami, 30; Miami Beach, Fla., 33; and
Wilmington, N.C., 0, an all-time record.

<HEAD>No Sorrow for Ceausescu as Romanian Immigrants Pray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian-Americans prayed for the thousands killed in the
uprising in their homeland, but few had sympathy for executed
President Nicolae Ceausescu, blamed for ``the worst nightmares in
Europe since World War II.''
   ``I didn't want him to die ... it's too easy,'' said Lidia
Oprean of Concord, Calif. ``I wanted him to suffer for a lot of
years and understand the Romanian people suffered.''
   Ms. Oprean was one of about 200 who gathered on the steps of San
Francisco City Hall Monday to call for U.S. aid to Romania.
   That was one of many gatherings around the country in response
to the execution Monday of Ceausescu, 71, and his wife, Elena.
Their executions were ordered after a secret military trial found
them guilty of the deaths of more than 60,000 Romanians and the
theft of more than $1 billion from the country, the new provisional
government announced.
   The Warsaw Pact's last hard-line communist ruler was ousted by a
popular revolt Friday. The uprising was triggered by the massacre
of thousands of people protesting Ceausescu's harsh rule, and at
least several hundred more are believed to have died in fighting
since Friday.
   In a service at St. Thomas the Apostle Romanian Orthodox Church
in St. Louis Hills, Mo., the Rev. Dimitrie Vincent said his
country's glimpse of freedom was won at a high cost in bloodshed.
   ``This is agonizing. This is a terrible tragedy,'' Vincent said.
``In the last 40 years, there hasn't been a peaceful Christmas, a
Christmas where Christians in Romania were free to worship until
this year.''
   About 100 people attended a memorial service outside the United
Nations in New York for those killed in the uprising. Mark Sherman,
who left Romania five years ago to join his mother who defected
earlier, said Ceausescu ``got what he deserved.''
   ``He's one of the worst nightmares in Europe since World War
II,'' Sherman said.
   The group lit 48 candles at the bottom of a wooden cross on
which hung a lantern and a sign saying, ``In memory of the Romanian
heroes who have died for freedom of religion, liberty and justice.''
   Isai Hotaran, 25, who left Romania in 1987, joined about 20
other emigres in Lansing, Mich., to set up a fund-raising network
to channel aid back to their impoverished homeland.
   ``I am not pleased with the death,'' Hotaran said. ``Killing him
is not enough punishment. Letting him and his family live in prison
would have been more just. I don't think that Ceausescu had any
idea what he had done to Romania.''
   In Seattle, Dr. V. Alin Botoman, who fled Romania as a
teen-ager, described the despair he encountered on an August vist
to his hometown of Fagaras in southern Transylvania.
   ``I met childhood friends who looked 10 years older than I do,
just blank faces,'' Botoman said. ``People were desperate. They
were standing in lines for bones they wouldn't feed their dogs
here. They were only giving out meat on holidays.''
   Simona Simut, a Romanian-American activist in Chicago, said a
public trial for Ceausescu wouldn't have worked.
   ``The people of Romania hate him so much that they probably
would have just ran to the courtroom and killed him themselves
before he even got to a trial,'' she said.
   A group of Romanian immigrants in Denver held a tearful memorial
for victims of the revolt at the end of Sunday Mass at the
Transfiguration Orthodox Church. Dumitru Manea mourned the dead,
but celebrated the country's chances for change.
   ``Nothing can happen without sacrifice,'' Manea said. ``This is
the lesson of history.''

<HEAD>Communist Leader Escapes From Military Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jailed leader of the outlawed
Communist Party escaped from a maximum-security stockade by bribing
her guards, a military official said today.
   Wilma Tiamzon, wife of party chairman Benito Tiamzon, escaped
Monday during Christmas celebrations inside Camp Crame, the
Philippine Constabulary headquarters, in suburban Quezon City, the
official said.
   The escape was discovered this morning, said Col. Alfredo
Filler, chief of staff of the Constabulary.
   A press statement said Mrs. Tiamzon, who was arrested Oct. 2,
``apparently mixed with visitors who were allowed inside the ...
jail and slipped without being noticed.''
   Mrs. Tiamzon allegedly was the head of the party's Finance
Commission, secretary of its National Peasant Commission and a
member of the executive committee of the party Central Committee
and of the Politburo. A $46,000 reward had been offered for her
capture.
   Her husband remained at large.
   ``It seems that they bribed the guards,'' Filler said, adding
that a Constabulary officer and three enlisted men were being
questioned. ``With regard to the physical security at the camp, I
think we have taken every measure to ensure that there will be no
other escape.''
   Romulo Kintanar, chief of the Communist New People's Army,
escaped from the same stockade in November 1988.
   Kintanar and his wife, Gloria Jopson, escaped while attending
the birthday party of camp's jail warden, who has since been
replaced.
   Constabulary chief Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano today ordered the
arrest of the officer in charge of the stockade, Capt. Victor
Diego, and three enlisted men for ``laxity.''
   Montano also ordered the constabulary's inspector general, Brig.
Gen. Carlos Malana, to investigate the latest escape.

   A woman driving up to 80 mph the wrong
way on an interstate crashed head-on into another car, killing four
of its five family members and herself, authorities said.
   The woman, who was driving alone, apparently missed her exit,
made a U-turn on Interstate 5, and collided with the car carrying a
family from Tracy about 1 a.m. Christmas Day, California Highway
Patrol officers said.
   Killed were Dale Cooper, 34, his two sons, Michael, 15, and
Christopher, 10, and his mother, Nae Cosby. Cooper's wife, Diana,
35, was in critical but stable condition Tuesday at Doctors Medical
Center in Modesto, where she underwent surgery.
   Also killed was L'Tanya Clause, 26, of Modesto, who may have
been driving 80 mph before her car crashed into the Coopers',
officers said.
   Highway Patrol investigators said they had ruled out fog or
alcohol as contributing to the accident.

   Robert J. Shinkle, 23, of Springfield, Mass., was charged Monday

   Shinkle was overheard saying as he stocked food on United

   Iran dismissed its ambassador to Romania
for having failed to report the revolt against President Nicolae
Ceausescu, who visited Tehran the same week he was ousted, the
Foreign Ministry announced today.
   Mohammad Jamshid Gowhari was sacked on orders of Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted the ministry's director-general for press affairs,
Mohammad Hassan Qadiri, as saying.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said the dismissal ``was due to
Gowhari's failure to furnish the Foreign Ministry with a
comprehensive report on the internal situation in Romania'' before
Ceausescu flew to Tehran for a three-day visit Dec. 18.
   Also today, the Foreign Ministry announced recognition of the
new Romanian government, reported Tehran Radio monitored in Cyprus.
Iran joins the United States, the Soviet Union and a host of other
Eastern and Western nations in recognizing the country's new
leadership.
   Gowhari's dismissal reflected what appears to be mounting
embarrassment in Tehran stemming from Ceausescu's visit at a time
when his countrymen were in open revolt against him. Two days after
Ceausescu's return to Bucharest, he was overthrown by the uprising
that began a week earlier.
   Bucharest Radio reported that Ceausescu and his wife, Elena,
were executed Monday after they were found guilty during a secret
military trial of genocide and ``grave crimes'' during his
tyrannical 24-year rule.
   Gowhari was dismissed only three months before he was due to
return to Tehran, IRNA reported.
   Ceausescu was given a red carpet welcome in Tehran. Romania was
Iran's second-biggest trading partner in Eastern Europe, and during
his visit Ceausescu signed an agreement to buy 1 million barrels of
oil a year.
   After Ceausescu left and reports from Romania underlined the
brutality of his regime as the mass graves of victims of his secret
police were uncovered, Iranian newspapers demanded an official
explanation why the Romanian leader had been allowed to visit
Tehran.
   Velayati responded Sunday by saying the visit had been arranged
after frequent requests from Bucharest. But he stressed that
Iranian leaders repeatedly advised Ceausescu to ``bow to his
people's demands'' while he was in Tehran.
   During Ceausescu's visit, however, IRNA praised Romania as ``the
sole east European country rigidly adhering to its past
government.''
   IRNA reported that legislator Hojatoleslamn Sadeq Khalkhali
``strongly objected to Ceausescu's visit.''
   Khalkhali was president of the revolutionary courts in the early
days of the 1979 Islamic revolution and was notorious for
sentencing thousands of ``counter-revolutionaries'' to death, often
on the flimsiest of pretexts.
   Iran has also hotly denied European reports that Iranians were
fighting alongside Ceausescu's security police against rebel forces
and that Ceausescu had stashed a fortune in gold in Tehran banks.

   South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu today
defended his criticism of Israel's treatment of Palestinians and
said that former Israeli leaders engaged in terrorism in the past.
   Minister of Religion Zevulun Hammer told the Nobel Peace Prize
winner that he showed a ``simple lack of understanding'' toward the
problems of the Middle East.
   Hammer, who held a one-hour meeting with the Anglican leader,
was the only Israeli official to meet with Tutu during his five-day
Christmas pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
   Tutu has visited Bethlehem and the Christian village of Beit
Sahur in the occupied West Bank, met with Palestinian leaders and
prayed at Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the 6 million Jews
killed in the Holocaust.
   Israelis have been highly critical of Tutu's remarks, and he
told reporters that an Israeli shouted, ``Black Nazi pig!'' at him
during one rally.
   When asked if he would condemn Palestinian attacks on Israelis
as ``terrorism'' and whether he considered Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat a terrorist, Tutu said the
definition of terrorism must include military attacks on civilians.
   Tutu also said Israeli leaders have practiced terrorism.
   ``There are people in high positions in Israel who did things
which they would now call terrorism, for example the bombing of the
King David Hotel,'' he said. He was referring to the July 1946
bombing that killed 91 Britons, Arabs and Jews.
   The attack on the hotel, which contained British military
headquarters, was carried out by the Jewish Irgun underground led
by former Israeli leader Menachem Begin.
   ``That was a terrorist act and Mr. Begin later became prime
minister,'' Tutu said.
   Tutu said he did not meet with Israeli politicians because of
his tight schedule, but added if he had met Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir he would have repeated his call for Israel to end its harsh
treatment of Palestinians.
   ``I would say to him that I cannot myself understand people who
have suffered as Jews have suffered inflicting suffering of the
kind that I have seen on the Palestinians,'' Tutu said.
   He rejected Israelis' criticism of his comparison of South
Africa's oppression of blacks with Israel's treatment of
Palestinians, which he has repeated throughout his visit.
   ``Some of the things I have seen here are things I have seen at
home,'' he said. ``When I find injustice in the world, whoever
perpetrates it must know that I will condemn them.
   ``If I am accused, as I am often accused, of being anti-Semitic,
tough luck,'' he said.
   Hammer, who joined Tutu in an informal news conference after
their meeting, said the bishop's views of the Middle East showed
``to my sorrow, a simple lack of understanding.''
   ``I tried to explain that with us, in Judaism, and in the State
of Israel, freedom is part of the rights of man and part of our
beliefs,'' he said. ``The ones who have been denied their
historical rights are us and we are the ones who were persecuted.''

   A socialist deputy and publisher escaped
injury today when his car was blown up outside his home, police
said.
   An explosion caused by dynamite destroyed Makis Kouris' car only
minutes after he parked it outside his suburban home but no one was
injured, police said. No one claimed responsibility for the blast.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
police did not suspect Greece's three well-known urban guerrilla
organizations of involvement in the attack. He did not elaborate.
   Kouris, 47, and his brother, George, own three daily newspapers
and a radio station. He was elected to Parliament in June and
November.
   The Kouris' publications are unequivocal in their support for
former socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou. But critics in and out
of his party have charged them with using muckraking tactics to
villify political rivals.
   The brothers were strongly opposed to Papandreou's party joining
with the conservative and Communist parties in a coalition after no
party won a majority in November.
   Following the June elections, Parliament indicted Papandreou and
other socialist officials on charges of corruption during their
eight years in office. No date has been set for their trials.

   China and Iran, which had cordial ties with
Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, today joined countries
including the United States and Soviet Union that have pledged
support for Romania's new leadership.
   But the United States and some other governments regretted that
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were executed in Romania on
Monday after a secret military trial, were not tried publicly.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry called the executions an internal
affair. Spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said the decision ``has probably
been made taking into account the aspirations and will of the
Romanian people.''
   The Dutch government said it was ``concerned'' that the
Ceausescus had been executed after a secret trial and expressed
hope that ``the high principles of the rule of law will find their
place in the new Romania for which so many have fought to the
utmost.''
   In Britain, a Foreign Office spokesman said normal accepted
standards were difficult during ``a civil war situation.''
``Although one may regret a secret trial, at the time it was not
really surprising,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom
was not identified.
   ``Dracula Executed,'' blared the banner headline in Britain's
Daily Mirror. ``Tyrants are Executed,'' said the rival Daily
Express.
   Britain, China, Greece and Iran today joined at least 13 other
nations in pledging support for Romania's provisional government,
which took over after Ceausescu fled the capital in a helicopter on
Friday.
   The Beijing government also said the Red Cross Society of China
would provide immediate humanitarian aid, but it did not elaborate.
   Ceausescu was esteemed by Chinese leaders for maintaining good
relations with Beijing over the decades when China and the rest of
the Soviet bloc viewed each other with hostility.
   Ceausescu was one of the few socialist leaders to praise the
Chinese leadership's crackdown of the student-led pro-democracy
movement in June, when hundreds, perhaps thousands were killed by
troops in the streets of Beijing.
   Iran said today it recognized the Romanian government and Tehran
Radio said Iran's Red Crescent Society was ready to send medical
aid. But it dismissed its ambassador to Bucharest for failing to
inform Tehran of growing opposition to Ceausescu before the
Romanian leader visited Iran last week.
   The United States and France said Saturday they would not oppose
Soviet bloc intervention to support Romanians fighting against
police units loyal to Ceausescu, but the Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Monday the provisional government had not for Soviet
support.
   On Monday, food and medical aid began to flow into the hard-hit
country.
   French education minister Lionel Jospin said on French
television Monday night: ``Perhaps one would have wished that
Ceausescu could have been judged and said what he had to say.
Naturally we prefer public trials, but these are tragic and at the
same time very hopeful events we are seeing now in Romania.''
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino said: ``The staggeringly
high number of casualties reported in Romania is truly shocking and
deplorable. We join the rest of the world in wishing that country
and its people the blessings of peace, freedom and well-being.''

   A Romanian immigrant living in
California was killed by security forces as he tried to deliver
relief supplies in his embattled homeland, family members said.
   Ionel ``John'' Antimie, Jr., 21, a four-year resident of
Fullerton, was gunned down by forces loyal to executed former
Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu over the weekend, his father,
Ionel Antimie Sr. said through an interpreter.
   The State Department could not immediately confirm the report,
but planned an investigation, spokesman Philip Covington said
Monday.
   The family got the news Christmas morning from friends in
Portland, Ore., who were able to get a phone call through to the
East European nation and talked with the victim's brother,
Constantine, 32, Antimie said.
   The two brothers had been on a holiday driving tour through
Europe, their family said, and also had planned to visit Ionel
Antimie's girlfriend, Angelica Hij, 16, who lives in Cluj, Romania,
for the holidays.
   But when news of civil unrest in Romania broke, the brothers
delayed their journey in Germany and bought food, medicine and
other relief supplies worth ``thousands of dollars,'' Antimie said.
   The Oregon friend told Antimie that the brothers, traveling in a
rented car with their supplies, were stopped by uniformed security
officers who opened fire, killing Ionel Antimie but apparently
allowing his brother to flee.
   Constantine Antimie told the friend he had returned to the
shooting site and recovered his brother's body, his father said.
   Ionel Antimie Jr. helped run the family's contracting business.
He left Romania with his parents, four brothers and two sisters in
1985, according to a sister, Elena Furdui. Two brothers and one
sister stayed behind in Romania, she said.
   Tens of thousands of people have died in Romania in recent weeks
during the popular revolt. Ceausecu was executed by firing squad
Monday.
   The Antimie family notified the State Department Monday.
   Covington said the State Department will help if it can, but the
government does not usually track injuries or deaths of U.S.
residents who are not citizens.

   Rescuers today searched through charred
wreckage at the nation's second-largest petrochemical refinery for
a worker missing in the aftermath of an explosion and fire that
killed another man.
   Separately, heating oil futures prices shot higher in early
trading today in New York on speculation that the damage combined
with the nation's recent record-setting cold wave would tighten
already short home heating oil supplies.
   ``They are searching now and they'll search through the night in
the units where we've gotten clearance to go through,'' Exxon
spokesman Travis Joslin said Monday night. ``We've got to get
assurance before we send people back into the dangerous areas.''
   Seven people were injured and one contract worker was killed
when his pickup truck caught fire 100 to 200 feet from the
Christmas Eve explosion. The blast at the plant on the Mississippi
River in North Baton Rouge shattered windows up to six miles away
and ignited a fire that raged 15 hours.
   The name of the missing worker was withheld.
   Co-workers reported seeing the missing man after the explosion,
and officials wouldn't ruled out the possibility he wasn't at the
plant.
   The fire, which burned into Monday morning, engulfed eight
storage tanks holding more than 4 million gallons of oil and
lubricants, and two separator units, which remove water from oil,
the company said.
   It was believed to have begun in gas that was somehow released,
but the cause remained under investigation, said plant Manager Ed
Galante.
   Production was halted at the refinery, but Exxon officials said
they did not know whether heating oil shortages would worsen as a
result.
   ``Generally, the limit to fuel oil seems to be due to
transportation problems in bad weather, and not supplies,'' said
spokesman Ron Embry. The refinery has a capacity of more than 19
million gallons of crude oil a day.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
No. 2 heating oil jumped 4.01 cents a gallon to 85.75 cents in
early trading today.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer called out 50 National Guardsmen overnight to
prevent looting of stores where plate-glass windows were blown out.
Initial reports said looters hit some stores, but police Lt. Willie
Stevens said Monday that there had been no arrests.
   The dead man was identified as mechanic Harold Guillory, 31, of
Irwinville, an employee for contractor Vernon McKenny Enterprise,
said Exxon spokesman Dave Gardner.
   Three Exxon employees and four contract workers were treated at
hospitals and released, Gardner said.

<HEAD>Landmark Supreme Court Ruling: No Citizenship to Messianic Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Messianic Jews are not entitled to automatic
Israeli citizenship, Israel's Supreme Court has ruled, concluding
that their belief in Jesus makes them Christians instead of Jews.
   The ruling, published in Israeli newspapers today, was a boost
to ultra-Orthodox religious interpretations of the state's 1950 Law
of Return. The law forms the basis of Jewish immigration to Israel.
   The law and its subsequent amendments defines a Jew as a person
born to a Jewish mother or who converts to Judaism and professes no
other faith.
   Orthodox politicians have long sought a more precise definition,
and the court's Christmas Day ruling has resolved one issue.
   The 100-page decision said that belief in Jesus makes one a
member of another faith and ineligible for automatic Israeli
citizenship, the Jerusalem Post, Hadashot and Yediot Ahronot
dailies reported.
   Supreme Court spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen declined on two
occasions today to show the 100-page ruling to The Associated Press
or comment on its contents.
   According to the newspapers, Justices Menachem Elon, Aharon
Barak and Avraham Halima acted on an appeal by a South African
couple, Gary and Shirley Beresford, who belong to a Messianic
Jewish sect.
   Members of such sects often are referred to as ``Jews for
Jesus.''
   The Beresfords challenged a recent refusal by the Interior
Ministry, headed by Aryeh Deri of the ultra-orthodox Shas Party, to
grant them citizenship on grounds they were not Jews. Both
Beresfords were born Jewish.
   The Jewish mainstream rejects the central principle of Christian
faith that Jesus was the Messiah. Several small, Messianic Jewish
sects, however, do believe in Jesus as Christ while considering
their followers as Jews.
   In their ruling, the Israeli justices rejected this view.
   ``Messianic Jews attempt to reverse the wheels of history by
2,000 years,'' Elon wrote. ``But the Jewish people has decided
during the 2,000 years of its history that (Messianic Jews) do not
belong to the Jewish nation ... and have no right to force
themselves on it. Those who believe in Jesus are, in fact,
Christians.''
   The law in question has been a repeated source of tension
between secular and religious Jews in Israel.
   The main quarrel is over attempts by religious leaders to amend
the law to recognize only converts to Judaism by Orthodox rabbis.
Such a change would make it more difficult for many American and
Canadian Jews who belong to Reform and Conservative streams to
immigrate.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee today
directed Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top party officials to
travel to Lithuania to try to heal the break with that
independent-minded Baltic republic's party.
   Gorbachev on Monday bitterly criticized Lithuanian Communists
for their declaration of an independent party _ the first crack in
the unity forged by Vladimir Lenin before the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution.
   But he also urged caution. Lithuanian Communist leader Algirdas
Brazauskas, who urged the republic's Dec. 20 break with Moscow, was
quoted as telling Lithuanian radio that such a visit by Kremlin
officials would be ``good and useful.''
   The two-day meeting of the policy-making party Central Committee
found it ``reasonable for Soviet Communist Party General Secretary
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to make a trip to Lithuania,'' said an
announcement by the Tass news agency.
   Gorbachev and other officials will meet with Lithuanian party
officials and members of the public to find out their opinions on
Lithuania's drive for independence.
   After a visit by Gorbachev and other officials, another Central
Committee meeting will be held to make a firm decision on the
dispute with Lithuania, Tass said. There was no indication when the
visits or the next Central Committee meeting would be.
   Tass said the Central Committee also approved Gorbachev's
opening statement to the meeting, in which he mixed tough criticism
of Brazauskas and other party officials with calls for restraint
and reason.
   Thousands of Lithuanians rallied today in Vilnius' Cathedral
Square in support of the split, said Eduardas Potasinskas, an
editor at Lithuanian television.
   Potasinkas also reported on Brazauskas' comments, saying the
Lithuanian leader praised the Central Committee decision in a radio
interview shortly after the meeting ended today.
   At Monday's meeting, Gorbachev said: ``No part of the Soviet
Communist Party has the right to decide the question about its
independent existence with its own program and rules, not taking
into account the position of the Soviet Communist Party as a whole.
   ``And this means that the Communist Party of Lithuania was and
remains a part of the united Soviet Communist Party,'' said
Gorbachev, who is party general secretary as well as the country's
president.
   Tass, in a report on the first day of the Central Committee
meeting, said Gorbachev accused the leaders of the Lithuanian party
as having ``gone over to playing up to nationalist, separatist
forces.''
   Gorbachev tried for several months to head off the split that
the Lithuanian party declared in Vilnius, and at the Congress of
People's Deputies meeting in Moscow on Saturday lashed out at
separatists.
   ``Today, to realize the right to self-determination through
secession means to blow up the union, set the people against each
other and sow conflict and blood and death,'' Gorbachev said at
that meeting. ``That's what separatists are pushing us toward.''
   He also told the Central Committee that the Soviet government
should consider the legal status of public movements that are
``carrying out separatist activities and whipping up nationalist
terror.''
   Gorbachev did not identify any such organizations, but in the
context of the debate he likely was referring to Lithuania's
Sajudis and other organizations pushing for broad sovereignty and
ultimately complete independence from the Soviet Union.
   Nevertheless, according to a text of his statement published by
the Communist Party daily Pravda today, he urged ``maximum
restraint'' to allow emotions to calm down.

<HEAD>Baby Girl Abandoned on Christmas Eve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newborn baby girl found abandoned in freezing
weather on Christmas Eve was recovering today from frostbite as
authorities searched for her mother.
   The baby, dubbed ``Christie Eve Noel'' by a pediatrician at
Loyola University Medical Center in suburban Maywood, was in good
condition, said nursing supervisor Barbara Nostz.
   ``If we in fact find the mother, she could be charged with child
abandonment,'' said Detective Dave Krebes of the Hillside Police
Department.
   The 6-pound, 3-ounce baby was found wrapped in a blanket Sunday
afternoon outside a vacant apartment in Hillside, just west of
Chicago, authorities said.
   Residents of other units in the complex apparently heard the
infant crying and notified local officials, said Loyola spokesman
Mike Maggio.
   Authorities were unsure how long the child had been outside in
the 12-degree weather. Her feet were red with frostbite when she
was admitted to the hospital, but were returning to a healthy shade
of pink, pediatric nurse Gale Goodfriend said Monday.
   ``I don't really understand how the mother could do this,'' Ms.
Goodfriend said. ``She's a real beautiful baby, and it's real nice
having her here. It's Christmas and we got a little gift.''
   ``She suffered some frostbite to her feet due to the cold, but
it's not serious,'' Maggio said. ``There will not be any
long-lasting problems for her.''
   The infant will be turned over to the state Department of
Children and Family Services while the search for her mother
continues, Krebes said.

   Residents of this U.S. territory were advised
to stock up on emergency supplies as a powerful typhoon stalled 200
miles to the east.
   Typhoon Jack, unusually late in the season for a major storm,
had sustained winds of 125 mph with gusts to 155 mph at 1 a.m.
Wednesday and was gradually weakening, according to the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center.
   Forecasters said the typhoon was expected to drift slowly toward
the northwest during the next 18 to 24 hours on a course that would
take it 57 miles north of Saipan.
   Before it stalled in the western Pacific, the storm had been on
a track that would take it between Guam and Saipan, the capital of
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands north of Guam.
   ``The potential for erratic movement is high,'' said hourly
advisories issued by the center.
   The Air Force sent B-52 bombers to Okinawa and the Navy ordered
its large ships to sea to ride out the storm, officials said.
   Banks closed today and the 125,000 residents of Guam and the
30,000 people on Saipan were advised to get supplies of food,
water, batteries and the like.
   Guam is under a Tropical Cyclone Condition 2, meaning a storm
could hit the island within 24 hours.

   Government TV today showed the bodies
of former President Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife after they were
executed by a firing squad, and Romanians rejoiced at evidence of
the Communist dictator's death.
   Television also showed a former torture chamber run by his
dreaded secret police in the western city of Timisoara. It said
more then 12,000 protesters were killed by the police after the
unrest that sparked a popular revolt.
   The new provisional government today appointed its leader, Ion
Iliescu, as chairman of the 37-member governing council. The
government also named a prime minister.
   The videotape showed the Ceausescus' bullet-riddled bodies lying
against a wall after an earlier sequence of the couple in
captivity. A close-up showed Ceausescu lying with blood on the
right side of his head.
   The actual shooting by firing squad was not shown, nor was its
location disclosed.
   Ceausescu, 71, and his wife, Elena, 72, were tried by a secret
military tribunal and executed Christmas Day for ``genocide'' and
other crimes. They were captured Saturday, a day after a popular
uprising forced them from power.
   ``We are people carried away by a very spontaneous process,''
Iliescu told French television. ``So there was a general demand
which pushed us to follow this process, first of all under the
pressure of the terrorist groups who wanted to free him.''
   The new prime minister, Petre Roman, told the network the
tribunal sentenced Ceausescu to death because officials had
information ``concerning possible attacks on the place where he
was.''
   By trying the couple, putting them to death swiftly and showing
the bodies, the revolutionary government apparently was trying to
persuade Ceausescu's ruthless security troops to surrender to the
army, which joined the people in revolt. Thousands have been killed
since the revolt began 11 days ago.
   The new government blamed Ceausescu for the deaths of 60,000
people. The death toll was for the whole of Ceausescu's 24-year
rule, said Romanian sources abroad and a correspondent for the
Yugoslv state Tanjug news agency.
   Reports have said as many as 80,000 died in the popular
uprising. Hundreds were reported tortured and buried in mass
graves, and thousands were killed in some of the fiercest street
battles since World War II.
   The military tribunal said the Ceausescus also were convicted of
undermining the nation and its economy and attempting to flee with
more than $1 billion plundered from the people and stashed in
foreign banks.
   The broadcast of the torture chamber showed ``calcinated bodies,
pieces of hairy scalps, blood and tortured bodies lying on the
floor. The victims were brought here naked,'' an unidentifed
commentator said.
   ``How small were Hitler's lackeys. They were genuine angels
(compared with the secret police),'' he said.
   This morning, an uneasy calm prevailed in Bucharest with no
shooting to be heard for the first time in days and, according to
the radio and Romanian sources, Ceausescu loyalist forces were
surrendering en masse.
   Power stations, factories, dairies and bakeries have resumed
production, the official news agency Agerpress said this morning.
   There was a brief celebration in downtown Bucharest, with cars
honking their horns, as government radio announced the appointment
of the new leaders, who included Dumitru Maziliu as vice chairman
of the governing council.
   It said the National Salvation Committee also issued a decree
appointing Roman prime minister until elections promised for early
next year. Romanian observers in the West said they did not know
who Roman was.
   Another decree, also signed by Iliescu, appointed Maj. Gen.
Nicolae Militaru minister of national defense. Iliescu, said to be
a close friend of Mikhail S. Gorbachev from school days in Moscow,
is a former senior Communist official whom Ceausescu demoted for
speaking out against the dictator.
   Sporadic fighting in central Bucharest had continued late into
Monday night, driving many people from the streets by the time the
executions were announced.
   TV footage showed Ceausescu being helped out of an armored
vehicle by a soldier, then submitting to a blood pressure test.
   Unshaven, gaunt and visibly tired, Ceausescu smiled a few times
for the cameras and once patted the hand of his wife and
second-in-command, who sat forlornly, a beige fur-lined coat pulled
tight around her and her head swathed in a scarf.
   Romanians at the Intercontinental Hotel clustered eagerly around
a TV set as the footage appeared around 1:45 a.m., cheering and
even spitting at the television screen at their hated ex-rulers.
   ``Oh, what wonderful news. The anti-Christ died,'' an
unidentified Bucharest radio announcer exulted minutes after the
announcement was made.
   ``Today, we removed the most hideous tyrant who soiled with
blood the history of Romania,'' added another unidentified man on
radio hours later.
   Word of the execution came three days after the Ceausescus fled
Bucharest by helicopter, toppled by a popular revolt that began
Dec. 15 in the western city of Timisoara with unrest that led to a
massacre of anti-government protesters by security forces.
   Word of the execution, the first of a Communist leader in
Eastern Europe since Imre Nagy was hanged in 1958 for his part in
the 1956 uprising in Hungary, came without warning.
   Today, China and Iran _ which had maintained friendly ties with
Ceausescu's Romania _ joined other countries including the Soviet
Union, West Germany, Japan and the United States in recognizing the
new government. Romanian ambassadors in at least 27 countries also
declared their support.
   Food and medical supplies poured in from countries including
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and France, among the first nations to
recognize the new government.
   The National Salvation Committee has drawn together
ex-Communists, dissident intellectuals and the priest whose
threatened arrest sparked the revolt. It has pledged an end to
one-party rule and free elections by April.
   In Timisoara, local army commander Corneliu Vajda said 600
bodies of people slain by security forces had so far been found in
mass graves and estimated the total number of dead at 4,670, the
Austrian Press Agency reported, quoting Finnish journalist Marita
Vihervuori as its source.
   Unconfirmed reports of casualties have run as high as tens of
thousands. But Victor Ciobanu, health minister under Ceausescu and
now in opposition to him, said 500 people had died in Bucharest
alone over the past four days, with 2,000 wounded.
   A skittish calm that settled over much of Bucharest earlier
Monday was shattered Christmas night by a flurry of automatic
weapons and artillery fire.
   Heavy explosions boomed near the Intercontinental Hotel in
downtown Bucharest. Volleys of sniper fire were answered
immediately with staccato bursts of automatic weapons that drowned
out the Christmas carols playing for the first time in 42 years on
Romanian radio.

   Billy Martin, the hard-drinking,
hard-nosed former Yankee manager whose on- and off-field brawls
overshadowed his accomplishments on the baseball diamond, died in
an alcohol-related traffic accident.
   He was 61.
   Martin was a passenger in a pickup truck that skidded off an icy
road in front of his farm Christmas Day. The driver, longtime
friend William Reedy, 53, of Detroit, was charged with driving
while intoxicted, Broome County Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said.
   Neither man was wearing a seat belt, Reedy told authorities.
   ``It's like losing part of my own family,'' said New York
Yankees' principal owner George Steinbrenner, who hired and fired
Martin five times as manager. ``He was one of a kind.''
   ``If somebody rubbed wrong against him, he'll punch ya in the
nose no sooner than look at him,'' said Yogi Berra, a former
teammate and a friend for 40 years. ``But he was a great man, a
kind-hearted man and he loved baseball.''
   Martin died of a broken neck and spinal cord compression at
Wilson Memorial Hospital in Johnson City after the 5:45 p.m. crash,
according to hospital spokesman Michael Doll.
   The truck went off a hairpin curve and came to rest at the
driveway of Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, about 150 miles
northwest of New York City near the Pennsylvania line.
   Ruffo said the hairpin curve has a history of accidents.
   ``People who live out in that area and use that road know it's
there,'' he said today. ``But Reedy was from Detroit and that could
have been a factor that he wasn't familiar with the area. If you're
not familiar with it, it doesn't take much to end up in the ditch.''
   Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium,
suffered a broken hip and possible broken ribs and was in serious
condition at the hospital, Doll said.
   ``They went way back,'' said Reedy's son, Bill, 19. A distraught
Martin called Reedy just after his mother died 10 days ago, Bill
Reedy said. He said his father didn't hesitate to go to his
friend's side.
   Reedy said he and Martin had gone to a store and then stopped
for a drink, according to Deputy Steve Glanville, who issued the
citation.
   An autopsy scheduled to be performed today on Martin was
canceled at the request of family members, Doll said.
   Alfred Manuel Martin was born May 16, 1928, in Berkeley, Calif.
His Italian grandmother called him ``Belli,'' Italian for pretty,
and it evolved into Billy.
   Martin played second base for the Yankees from 1950-57,
including five World Series championships.
   His lifetime batting average for his 11 seasons was just .257,
but he always seemed at his best in October. He set a six-game
World Series record in 1953 by batting .500 in the series and
hitting safely in all six games. He also set a seven-game World
Series record by hitting safely in every game of the 1956 Series.
   ``He was a great little guy,'' said Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio.
   Martin brought his combative style to the dugout as manager,
arguing with players and umpires and getting his teams to play a
hard-running game dubbed ``Billy ball.''
   But his antics off the field clouded his career. He got into a
fight in a topless bar in Texas on May 6, 1988, hours after being
ejected from a game for arguing a call with an umpire. Six weeks
later, he was fired by Steinbrenner.
   Another barroom incident had him back in the headlines just this
month. Martin, in Terre Haute, Ind., on Dec. 9 to speak at a
fund-raiser, was sitting at a bar when someone knocked over a
woman's purse containing a .38-caliber derringer, causing the gun
to fire. The bullet whizzed past Martin and struck the bar two feet
from him.
   Martin was first hired to manage the Yankees in 1975. During
that stint, he guided the team to a World Series title in 1977, a
season marked by his shoving match with slugger Reggie Jackson in
Boston's Fenway Park in June.
   The next season, Jackson was suspended five days after ignoring
Martin's instruction to bunt.
   Five days later, Martin lashed out at Jackson and Steinbrenner
saying, ``One's a born liar; the other's convicted,'' a reference
to Steinbrenner's guilty plea to violating federal elections laws
for a 1972 campaign contribution to President Nixon.
   Martin resigned in tears a day after his statement. Only five
days later, however, Steinbrenner announced he would bring Martin
back, a promise he fulfilled the next year.
   His latest firing was on June 23, 1988, but Steinbrenner
retained him as a consultant.
   Martin married his fourth wife, the former Jill Guiver, in
January 1988. In an interview last July, Martin said he was
enjoying life on the farm and out of the spotlight.
   During his 16 seasons as an American League manager, Martin's
teams compiled a 1,258-1,018 record, a .553 winning percentage.
   He led the Minnesota Twins to an American League West title in
1969 and the Detroit Tigers to an AL East title in 1970. He led the
Yankees to AL pennants in 1976 and 1977 and the Oakland Athletics
to an AL West title in 1981. He also managed the Texas Rangers.
   A plaque honoring Martin in Yankee Stadium's center field
monument area says: ``Casey's Boy,'' a reference to the special
affection the late Casey Stengal had for Martin. ``A Yankee
Forever,'' the plaque says, ``A man who knew only one way to play _
to win.''
   ``Billy was a true Yankee _ one of the truest ever,'' said
current Yankees manager Bucky Dent, who played for Martin in the
1970s.
   In addition to his wife, survivors include son Billy Joe of
Lubbock, Texas, and daughter, Kelly, both from previous marriages.
   Funeral services were not immediately announced.

<TEXT>
   Nobel Prize-winning author Samuel Beckett, who
created a world of everlasting despair and left theatergoers
``Waiting for Godot,'' died at age 83 of respiratory failure and
was buried today, his publisher said.
   The playwright, poet and novelist whose work depicted death and
decay as mankind's sole and inescapable destiny, was buried this
morning at Montparnasse Cemetery in a private ceremony, said
publisher Jerome Linden.
   Beckett died Friday in Paris, Linden said.
   Jack Lang, culture minister of France, Beckett's adopted home,
called him ``an immense writer, exceptionally exacting, who has
profoundly marked his century.''
   The Irish-born author of ``Godot'' and ``Endgame'' rejected the
redeeming optimism that might have made him more accessible to a
mass audience and gained him earlier recognition as one of the
century's greatest writers.
   His was a stark world peopled with vagabond couples trapped by
an apocalyptic sense of doom and caught in a never-ending,
master-slave dialectic often laced with wry Irish humor.
   Beckett's work was a cry of agony and compassion at the hopeless
misery, futility and loneliness of human existence, which he called
a slow death.
   That theme reappears in the dozens of plays, novels, poems and
short stories he wrote in both French and English during a career
that spanned more than 50 years.
   ``He was a man of great imagination. He was in a sense a quiet
leader,'' British playwright Harold Pinter told Independent Radio
News. ``He was in the forefront of modern literature. He was
totally original and a man of great courage, not only in himself,
but in his work. His work knew no bounds really. He didn't accept
any limitations.''
   Critics were scandalized by his experiments on the stage.
``Breath,'' which premiered in 1970, had no actors, no dialogue and
no action _ just a heap of gloomily lit garbage cans onstage, a
baby's screams and the amplified sound of heavy breathing. The play
lasted just 30 seconds.
   Until French director Roger Blin rescued the long-published but
never performed ``Waiting for Godot'' from obscurity in 1952,
Beckett's pessimistic and often difficult style limited his
audience to an intellectual elite.
   The play, about two tramps waiting for a third, was a huge
success and brought the author instant world renown. It was
translated into and performed in more than 20 languages, and it
helped Beckett win the Nobel Prize for literature in 1969.
   Always shy and withdrawn, Beckett refused to attend the award
ceremonies in Stockholm. He sent his publisher instead and fled to
Tunisia to escape the news media. The citation described Beckett as
``a pioneer of a new modesty of expression in fiction and the
theater ... whose writing rises like a cry for mercy from all
mankind.''
   Beckett was secretive about his private life. He granted only
rare interviews, and was one of the few writers to refuse to appear
on ``Apostrophes'' _ France's most popular book review television
show.
   Even the date of Beckett's birth was wrapped in mystery. He said
he was born in Dublin on Good Friday, April 13, 1906. But his
biographer, Deirdre Bair, suggested he was really born a month
earlier, with Beckett shifting it to the anniversary of the
crucifixion as a symbolic boost to his self-made legend.
   The son of a surveyor, Beckett enjoyed a comfortable,
upper-middle class Protestant upbringing. Though he said he had ``a
happy childhood,'' he once admitted to ``always feeling lonely.''
   He studied modern languages at Trinity College, Dublin, and
first came to Paris in 1928 to lecture in Engish at the prestigious
Ecole Normale Superieure.
   In Paris he met another Irish exile, James Joyce, who was to
have a profound influence on his future writing. ``Joyce had a
moral effect on me,'' Beckett said later. ``He made me realize the
meaning of artistic integrity.''
   After Beckett's father, William France Beckett, died in Dublin
in 1933, his mother urged Beckett to drop his literary ambitions
and take up some serious profession.
   To escape her and the middle-class atmosphere of his family,
Beckett settled permanently in Paris in 1937.
   Beckett's move came at a time when international tension was
mounting, but he said ``I preferred France at war to Ireland at
peace.''
   In 1938, Beckett was stabbed in a Paris street brawl. A deep
knife wound pierced his lung and narrowly missed his heart. A
pianist passing by on her bicycle stopped to help the gravely
injured man and have him taken to hospital.
   The girl, Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil, though six years his
senior, became his lifelong companion and they finally married in
secret in 1961.
   Ms. Deschevaux-Dumesnil died July 17 in Paris at the age of 89.
The couple had no children.
   During World War II the couple worked with the underground
Resistance movement in Nazi-occupied France and Beckett was awarded
the Croix de Guerre with a gold star in 1945.
   Beckett, who all his life shunned politics, later said he joined
the Resistance not to help France win the war, but ``to fight the
Germans who were making life hell for my friends.''
   Indeed, despite his rejection of the limelight, Beckett was a
loving and loyal friend. He would spend hours in Left Bank cafes
listening to his painter friends _ including Holland's Van Velde
brothers, the English painter Jack B. Yeats (William Butler Yeats'
brother) and Alberto Giacometti _ talk about their work.
   He also met France's leading Surrealist writers and eventually
translated several poems of Paul Eluard and Andre Breton.
   Beckett was not just a serious intellectual, and he was known as
the man who preferred referring a newspaper's sports pages to
reviews of his own plays.
   Beckett attributed his success to an ``intuitive sense of
despair,'' rather than to talent.
   He once described himself as ``doomed to spend the rest of my
days digging up the detritus of my life and vomiting it out over
and over again.
   ``Optimism is not my way. I shall always be depressed, but what
comforts me is the realization that I can now accept this dark side
as the commanding side of my personality,'' he said.
   In later plays written in French and first performed on the
Paris stage, Beckett developed his theme of man's losing battle
against destiny. In ``Endgame,'' a blind paralytic laments his fate
while his senile and crippled parents die of despair in garbage
cans.
   ``There are no landmarks in my work,'' he said. ``We are all
adrift. We must invent a world in which to survive, but even this
invented world is pervaded by fear and guilt. Our existence is
hopeless.''

   The Deep South's deep freeze began abating today, melting
Christmas snow that fell as far south as the Gulf Coast, but
thousands of people were without water as frozen, cracked water
pipes and mains thawed and leaked.
   Temperatures stayed below freezing overnight throughout much of
the South. It was 30 degrees in Jacksonville, Fla., at 4 a.m. EST.
But temperatures were expected to reach the 60s in the Carolinas by
the end of the week, the National Weather Service said.
   ``The roads are passable, but it's a sheet of ice in most
places,'' said Larry Dozier of the Dare County, N.C., sheriff's
department.
   A new cold front, not as severe as the one that set hundreds of
low temperature records last week, swung down from Canada and snow
fell today in an arc from Indiana and Kentucky to Maine, the
National Weather Service said.
   West of that air mass, the weather was mild in many places and
Dickinson, N.D., had a reading of 36 above zero at 6 a.m.
   During the weekend, a rare Southern blizzard brought up to 15
inches of snow to Wilmington, N.C., the most ever measured there,
but much of that was expected to melt today with highs in the 40s.
It was the first white Christmas in more than a century in the
coastal city, in Georgia and in Mobile, Ala., on the Gulf Coast.
Snow also dusted northern Florida.
   Citrus growers in Florida and Texas reported extensive crop
damage.
   Officials in Texas estimated 70 percent of the state's citrus
crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop was destroyed when
the temperatures plunged into the low 20s and upper teens as the
holiday weekend began.
   Citrus losses are estimated at $200 million so far and could top
$500 million as trees begin to show effects from the freeze, said
David Galvan, district director of the Texas Department of
Agriculture in Brownsville.
   Florida officials hadn't released citrus loss figures yet today,
but damage is likely to be substantial to the state's $3.5 billion
crop since much of it was still on the trees when freezing
temperatures began Saturday. Strawberry crops suffered less damage.
   In South Carolina, airlines resumed normal schedules at
Charleston today after reducing flights because of the snow, an
airport spokeswoman said. The Myrtle Beach Jetport, closed for a
third straight day Monday, also was expected to resume operations
sometime later today; the jetport can operate only during daylight
because runway lights are covered with snow, said Todd Crawford,
deputy airport director.
   In Florida, Mike Mahoney, spokesman for Tampa Electric Co.,
appealed to families in a six-county area to shut off Christmas
tree lights to save energy. Other Florida utilities imposed
rotating brownouts, and in some caes, blackouts.
   More than 60,000 homes and businesses in Jackson, Miss., were
without water or had greatly reduced pressure because of water-main
breaks and because the Pearl River had frozen around intakes for
the municipal water system. The city government was closed because
of the water problem.
   Texas cities also had broken water pipes, with more than 6,000
leaks reported in Houston, and some people had been without water
since Friday. Hotels in Houston offered discount rates for people
who wanted to take showers.
   Taps also ran dry in the Charleston, S.C., area.
   ``There's got to be thousands of broken lines out there,'' said
Steve Kinard, manager of Charleston's public works department,
which supplies water to 400,000 people.
   ``We've got water mains and pipes bursting all over the city,
everything from hotels to businesses to homes,'' said George A.
Ingram, a fire chief in Norfolk, Va.
   At least 93 deaths from the Plains to the East Coast have been
blamed on the cold since Dec. 15. Victims this weekend included an
18-year-old boy who fell through ice on a lake in DeKalb County,
Ga., and a 7-week-old boy who froze to death in his crib in an
unheated apartment in Miami. Police said they may charge the
parents, who left the baby unattended after an argument.
   The Plains celebrated Christmas with a respite from subzero
temperatures, but a fresh blast of arctic chill blew across the
northern Plains and upper Great Lakes late Monday, dropping as much
as 10 inches of snow in parts of Michigan.
   Christmas Day was the coldest day ever in Wilmington, N.C.,
where it fell to zero degrees. Its previous all-time low was 5
degrees in February 1899. Records also were set Monday for the date
in Florida with lows of 29 in Fort Lauderdale, 30 in Miami and 46
in Key West.
   Farther north, the cold prevented the annual re-enactment of
George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River to capture
British troops at Trenton, N.J. ``We couldn't get our four boats
into the river because it was a sheet of ice,'' said James
Gallagher, who has played the role of Washington since 1985.
   And in Buffalo, N.Y., organizers who struggled for three years
to stage a Winterfest of snow sculpting and ice skating despite
balmy temperatures gave up this year and canceled the festival _
and then the snow began. With nearly 3 feet of snow so far this
season, Buffalo had its first white Christmas since 1985.
   ``Someone just called me and said, `Can't you bring it back?
Then we won't have any snow,''' said Dottie Gallagher, spokeswoman
for Buffalo Place, which had been one of the sponsors.
   It wasn't cold all over the country, though. In Southern
California, surfers got to try out new gift surfboards on Christmas
as temperatures peaked in the low 80s.
   ``All I want to do is swim and enjoy the heat,'' said Linda
Kinsey of Chicago as she stepped off a plane at Los Angeles
International Airport.

   Israeli warplanes today raided a major
Communist Party command post south of Beirut, and police said at
least three people were killed. Israel said it destroyed the base.
   The air strike came just hours after Israeli paratroopers backed
by tanks and air cover swept deep into southern Lebanon, killing
guerrillas and wiping out another Lebanese Communist base.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said the Communist
command post at Rmeile, 20 miles south of Beirut, was destroyed in
the air raid.
   ``At the terrorist target ... there are dead and wounded,'' the
army said, adding that the Israeli fighter jets returned safely to
their bases. No further details were released.
   Lebanese police said at least three people were killed and seven
wounded in the five-minute air raid. Israeli authorities said there
were no Israeli casualties in either attack.
   Six Phantom F-4 fighter bombers attacked Rmeile, and guerrillas
fired several heat-seeking SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles that were
deflected by balloons released by the Israeli pilots, police
reported.
   Earlier today, paratroopers attacked a Communist base which the
army described as a terrorist target used as a launching pad for
anti-Israeli attacks.
   That attack was the Israeli army's biggest ground operation in
Lebanon in more than a year. The later air raid was Israel's 17th
such strike in Lebanon this year. At least 18 people were killed
and 109 wounded in the previous 16 air raids.
   In Beirut, police said army sappers defused a car packed with
165 pounds of explosives near Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office.
Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, was at home five blocks away when the bomb
was discovered, and police said it appeared he was not the target.
   A police spokesman said it was defused a half-hour before it was
set to go off. ``A bloodbath has been averted,'' said the
spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   The guerrilla base at Nabi Safa, in the foothills of Mount
Hermon 7{ miles north of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone''
in Lebanon, was manned by the Moscow-oriented Lebanese Communist
Party.
   The Israeli army's attack was its biggest ground operation in
Lebanon since an assault against the Syrian-backed Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command Dec. 9, 1988.
   The attack force of about 100 commandos pushed out from the
border enclave, occupied by the Israelis since 1985, in four tanks
and eight armored personnel carriers at 2 a.m. behind a massive
artillery barrage, police reported.
   The attackers stormed through the villages of Kfar Meshki and
Lebbaya in the eastern Bekaa Valley after two helicopter gunships
blasted them with eight rockets, destroying many houses, the
spokesman said. He cannot be named under standing regulations.
   Forty other commandos were then dropped by helicopters in Nabi
Safa, where they blew up the Communists' two-story command post
after raking the base with machine-gun fire, the spokesman added.
   He said the attackers pulled back into the security zone two
hours after the attack began.
   Israel carved out the two- to 15-mile wide border enclave to
curb guerrilla raids following its army's withdrawal from Lebanon
three years after it invaded in 1982.
   The 2,500-man South Lebanese Army holds the enclave along with
an estimated 1,500 Israeli troops.
   The Israeli assault came amid heavy fighting in south Lebanon
between two rival Shiite Moslem factions, the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-allied Amal.
   Police have reported at least 38 people killed and 150 wounded
in four days of battles in a power struggle for control of
Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.

writings of Samuel Beckett, the playwright who died Friday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``Waiting for Godot'':
   We are all born mad. Some remain so.
   
   Estragon: Let's go.
   Vladimir: We can't.

   Vladimir: We're waiting for Godot.

   From ``Malone Dies'':
   Death must take me for someone else.
   
   To be buried in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows
what stuff he is made of. To know he can do better next time,
unrecognizably better, and that there is no next time, and that it
is a blessing there is not, there is a thought to be going on with.

   From ``All that Fall'':
   This dust will not settle in our time. And when it does some
great roaring machine will come and whirl it all sky-high again.

   Clov: Do you believe in the life to come?
   Hamm: Mine was always that.

<TEXT>
   From ``Murphy'':
   There is no return game between a man and his stars.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``Stirrings Still,'' Beckett's last published work:
   A clock afar struck the hours and half-hours. The same as when
among others Darly once died and left him. Strokes now clear as if
carried by a wind now faint on the still air. Cries afar now faint
now clear. Head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the
half-hour would not and half fearing that it would not. Similarly
when the half-hour struck. Similarly when the cries a moment
ceased. Or merely wondering. Or merely waiting. Waiting to hear.

<HEAD>Riot Charges Overturned on Three Racial Attack Defendants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Misdemeanor riot convictions against three
teen-agers in connection with the Howard Beach racial attack, in
which a black man was killed, have been overturned on appeal.
   The three-page decision by a panel of Brooklyn Appellate
Division judges on the three defendants convicted in 1988 was
handed down Dec. 11 and reported in today's New York Post.
   Three other youths were convicted in a separate trial of
manslaughter and assault in the fatal racial attack.
   The case involved an attack on Dec. 20, 1986, by a group of
white males on several blacks, one of whom, Michael Griffith, was
chased onto a busy highway, where he was hit by a car and killed.
   The defendants, William Bollander, Thomas Farino and James
Povinelli, were sentenced in September 1988 to 34 days in jail to
be served on weekends over a four-month period. They were acquitted
of a more serious felony riot charge.
   Under the ruling, the indictments and convictions of the three
are thrown out. Prosecutors can resubmit the case to a grand jury
or drop the charges.
   A lawyer for the three defendants, Spiros A. Tsimbinos, said
today he had not yet seen the ruling.
   The appellate judges reversed the conviction because of errors
in the verdict sheets provided to the jury and because the trial
judge, Justice Thomas Demakos, failed to give the panel the option
of finding the three guilty of disorderly conduct, which carries a
maximum sentence of 15 days.

<HEAD>British Composer Sir Lennox Berkeley Dies At 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Lennox Berkeley, an eminent British composer
perhaps best known for his choral work the ``Stabat Mater,'' died
Tuesday at the age of 86.
   Berkeley, who suffered from a heart ailment and a type of
Alzheimer's disease, died in a London hospital of a respiratory
infection, said his son, Michael.
   Berkeley wrote opera, chamber music, concertos and four full
symphonies.
   He attended Oxford University where he read French, Old French
and philology before devoting himself to music.
   He studied under the great music teacher Nadia Boulanger in
Paris for five years and returned to Britain in 1935, the year of
his first major work, the oratorio ``Jonah.''
   Three years later he produced another choral work ``Domini est
Terra,'' then music for string quartets, solo instruments and
orchestra. His ``First Symphony'' was completed in 1940.
   The ``Stabat Mater,'' for six voices and 12 instruments, was
written for Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group and was first
performed in 1947.
   Berkeley was knighted in 1974 by Queen Elizabeth II. The
Composers' Guild of Great Britain named him Composer of the Year in
1973. Two years later he was elected to the presidency of the
Composers' Guild and the Performing Rights Society.
   Berkeley is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Freda
Bernstein, and three sons. A funeral service is planned for next
week, to be followed by a memorial concert.

   Police stormed a cell block controlled
by drug traffickers holding 18 hostages, and six traffickers were
killed and five hostages wounded, authorities said today.
   Police late Monday gained the release of all of the hostages,
including two children, and the situation at the La Picota jail in
southern Bogota had returned to normal, a Justice Department
spokesman said.
   The spokesman asked not to be identified so he would not become
the target of revenge by any of the prisoners involved.
   The rescue came after two days of fruitless negotiations with
the prisoners, who had taken the hostages after a failed jailbreak
Sunday.
   The prisoners subdued guards during visiting hours at the jail
and were putting on their uniforms in an attempt to escape,
Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported today.
   The paper, quoting prison sources, said authorities discovered
the plan and sealed off the cell block before the prisoners, all
held on drug trafficking charges, could flee.
   The trapped criminals then took hostages, including some
civilians who had been visiting their jailed family members, and
made a series of protests and demands, El Tiempo reported.
   The paper said the prisoners began by protesting the death of
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the trafficker of the Medellin cartel who
was killed Dec. 15 in a gunfight with police on Colombia's northern
coast.
   The prisoners said they would release the hostages only if the
administration of President Virgilio Barco agreed to end its
extradition of drug traffickers to the United States, El Tiempo
said.
   The administration has extradited 11 drug suspects since August
when it decreed the policy.
   The prisoners also demanded a meeting with the Colombian Justice
Minister, Roberto Salazar and other officials. They said that they
wanted to be transferred to another, less crowded jail, El Tiempo
reported.
   The Justice Ministry official reached by telephone said he could
not confirm the details of the takeover.

<HEAD>Blue Laws Have Liquor Sellers Singing New Year's Blues</HEAD>

   It's 9:59 p.m. on New Year's Eve in Little Rock, Ark. At a
downtown bar, the revelers are already chanting the countdown:
``... four ... three ... two ... one ... It's closing time!''
   New Year's Eve or not, when it's Sunday in Arkansas, the bar
closes at 10.
   Most states have some sort of law restricting liquor sales on
Sundays. So when New Year's Eve falls on a Sunday, as it does this
year, it's a less-than-festive holiday for those who make a living
selling alcohol.
   ``I think it will hurt the industry,'' said Ray Brezzo, who owns
a liquor store in Glastonbury, Conn. ``We're very, very
pessimistic.''
   In Connecticut, as in many states in the Northeast, bars and
restaurants can serve alcohol on Sundays but liquor stores cannot.
For New Year's Eve, Brezzo is hoping his customers will buy what
they need on Saturday _ but he's far from confident.
   ``Nobody knows what to expect,'' he said. ``Everybody's sort of
sitting on the edge of their seat.''
   Liquor stores in New York City are posting signs to remind their
customers to buy early. In Grand Forks, N.D., Happy Harry's Bottle
Shop is taking out newspaper advertisements with a similar reminder.
   Still, owner Hal Gershman said, ``No matter how much advertising
you do, and how much you try to tell people, there are still 60
percent of the people who don't pay attention and will show up at
the last minute.''
   Although North Dakota has among the nation's toughest blue laws,
the Legislature did agree this year to allow bars and taverns to
apply for special Sunday permits.
   But some communities, such as Minot, opted against issuing the
permits, much to the dismay of bar owners.
   ``We're put in an unfair disadvantage to the other major
cities,'' complained Jim Mellow, manager of the International Inn
in Minot, which caters to Canadian tourists. ``The people I have
talked to are bypassing Minot and heading to Bismark or Williston.''
   In Alabama, where restaurants and nightclubs can't sell alcohol
between 2 a.m. and midnight Sunday, some places will hold parties
the night before. Others will start their festivities at midnight.
As in several other Southern states, private clubs are exempted
from the law.
   Chris Fuller, general manager of American Pie, a 2-month-old
Montgomery nightclub without a private license, said he'd throw a
bash on Saturday night.
   ``But it's just not going to have the same whiz-bang as New
Year's Eve,'' he said. ``Obviously, it's a big loss. A
day-before-New Year's Eve party, that sounds pretty goofy.''
   Some states, such as Pennsylvania, specifically exempt New
Year's Eve from blue laws. In Baltimore County, Md., liquor store
owners successfully sued this year to open, arguing that a
convoluted liquor law was intended to exempt New Year's Eve from
Sunday restrictions but unintentionally had the opposite effect.
   ``We're real happy. The customers are happy,'' said Craig
Button, president of the Baltimore County Licensed Beverage
Association, after a judge ruled that the stores could open. ``It's
the second biggest day of the year for us (after Christmas Eve). It
would have cost us a lot of money.''
   In South Carolina, the executive director of the state Hotel and
Motel Association said she feared that restrictions on public
venues selling liquor on Sundays would lead to an increase in
drunken driving.
   ``What happens is so many people ... might have spent the night
in the hotel rather than drinking and partying and driving on the
road,'' said Susan Young, the association's executive director.
   Others noted that South Carolina's blue laws send some people
over the border into less-restrictive North Carolina to drink.
   Not all liquor sellers are upset about being forced to close.
Robert McIntyre, the owner of Old Town Liquor in Englewood, Colo.,
said he was quite content to spend this New Year's Eve in the quiet
of his own home.
   McIntyre said he wasn't worrying about any loss in business.
``It's just going to be nicer for me,'' he said.

   Business executives, bank officers, attorneys, real
estate brokers and even car dealers have been drafted into the war
on drugs _ whether they like it or not.
   Armed with stiff new regulations passed under the Bank Secrecy
Act of 1988, the IRS and other federal agencies are forcing
businesses and financial institutions to help track the estimated
$220 million in profits generated daily by illegal drug sales in
this country.
   ``All that cash does no good stored in boxes. They have to turn
it around. That necessarily involves legitimate businesses,'' said
Miami lawyer Charles Intriago, who has started a publication that
promises to make sense of the regulatory maze and keep subscribers
on the right side of the law.
   ``The government has conscripted the entire business community
and required them to submit their paper trails,'' Intriago said.
``It's saying, `OK, you're in the war now _ play by the rules or
face severe penalties.'''
   Money Laundering Alert is an eight-page monthly newsletter of
advice, statistics and reports on what criminals do to hide the
source of their money and what government is doing to uncover their
schemes.
   As trade journals go, Alert has a sizeable niche, says Intriago,
a former chief counsel for the House committee that oversees all
banking regulatory agencies. He also has prosecuted white-collar
criminals and drug traffickers as an assistant U.S. attorney in
Miami.
   Amid growing calls for the legalization of drugs and evidence
that interdiction efforts have failed to reduce the cocaine flowing
into this country, money laundering controls have become the
government's weapon of choice, Intriago said.
   ``The money laundering initiative has a higher probability of
success than the others, such as interdiction. It hits the profit
motive,'' he said.
   Enlisting the help of banks and other often unwitting
handmaidens to drug traffickers has already yielded impressive
results.
   Days before billionaire Medellin cartel enforcer Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha was gunned down in Colombia on Dec. 15, U.S. and
Swiss officials traced his profits and were able to freeze $61.8
million of his assets in several countries.
   Under money laundering laws, banks are required to report large
cash transactions. Soon, the Treasury Department could also force
banks to put names and addresses on the estimated $1.25 trillion
transferred daily around the world on telephone lines. Details of
that initiative are laid out in Alert's November issue.
   These new money laundering laws are still in their infancy and
many have yet to be enforced. Many otherwise law-abiding businesses
may be unaware of the penalties they face, Intriago said.
   Alert costs $295 a year, but Intriago notes that the Treasury
Department can now impose $500 fines for every negligent error a
bank teller makes on one of the required forms.
   ``Tell me these institutions wouldn't like to receive a
publication that could spare them thousands of dollars in fines, to
say nothing of the bad publicity,'' Intriago said.
   With the fourth issue going to press, Alert has more than 200
subscribers, ranging from banks, thrifts and credit unions to
lawyers and accountants, foreign governments and diplomatic offices.
   Intriago doesn't mention ``drug kingpins'' on his list, and he
bristles at the suggestion that his newsletter could be as useful
to criminals as to law-abiding citizens.
   ``We don't do criminal background checks on our subscribers, nor
does The Wall Street Journal,'' he said. ``A number of criminal
defense attorneys have subscriptions, however.''
   One of those attorneys sits on the newsletter's editorial board
as well: Neal Sonnett of Miami, who represented Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega when he was indicted on drug trafficking
charges in Florida.
   ``He's a very respected attorney,'' Intriago said, ``no matter
what his clientele is.''

   A clandestine gunpowder factory
exploded in northeastern Brazil on Tuesday, killing four people,
injuring more than 100 and destroying nearby homes, a fire
department official said.
   Fire department workers dragged more than 100 people from the
wreckage of their homes after the 8 a.m. blast, said Sgt. Pedro
Oliveira Filho in an interview from the city of Feira de Santana,
960 miles northeast of Rio.
   Several of the more badly injured were hospitalized in critical
condition.
   The TV Globo network showed scenes of houses near the factory
reduced to rubble and trees flattened.
   ``When I heard the explosion I remembered God because I thought
everyone was dead,'' said a woman identified as Maria Jose, who was
injured in the blast.
   The factory, which had been operating for five months, had a
sign out front identifying it as an auto repair shop, Globo
reported.

<TEXT>
   An unsigned poster mocking deposed Romanian
leader Nicolae Ceausescu and China's hard-line leaders went up at
Beijing University, birthplace of China's spring democracy
movement, a source confirmed Tuesday.
   ``Lost dog,'' read the poster, which was put up over the weekend
after Ceausescu's flight from his palace in Bucharest and before
his arrest and execution.
   It said the dog, named Ceausescu, might be coming to China to
join four other dogs _ a reference to China's senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, Premier Li Peng, President Yang Shangkun and Communist
Party chief Jiang Zemin.
   The poster, which authorities swiftly took down, violated
martial law regulations in force since May, when Beijing University
students led massive protests for democratic reform in China. Deng
ordered the army into Beijing in June to crush the protests,
leaving hundreds and possibly thousands dead.
   It was the third illegal ``big character poster'' in Beijing
this month, according to Chinese and Western sources. One urging
students to remember those killed in June went up at the Central
Drama Academy in early December, and another appeared briefly
inside the residential compound of the People's Daily, the
Communist Party newspaper.
   That poster read: ``Down with the illegal Li Peng government.''
   At a Dec. 8 dance, students at the drama school also played
songs about the June crackdown from a U.S.-recorded album titled
``China 1989,'' the sources said.
   No arrests have been reported in connection with any of the
incidents. However, at least six and possibly eight people were
arrested Dec. 9 when students from the Beijing College of
Aeronautics unfurled a banner reading: ``Motherland, why are you so
poor?''
   The incidents indicate that anger over June's events has not
subsided, despite intense political education and a scaling down of
the troop presence in Beijing.
   If anything, tensions have increased as authorities have
increased controls. Among other measures, students say the
government appears to be closing the door slowly on study abroad
for all except state-sponsored students by making it impossible for
other students to take the necessary tests or obtain college
transcripts.
   In this atmosphere, news of the democratic changes in East
Europe has been greeted with pleasure but also bitterness by some
Chinese students that their movement did not also succeed.
Romania's uprising has aroused the greatest excitement, because it
was the only other country where hard-line Communist leaders
resorted to violence.
   At one college, some students held a party to celebrate
Ceausescu's ouster.
   The official news media has carried only sparse reports on the
uprising and omitted any explanation of its cause.
   At least one hotel in Beijing stopped selling foreign newspapers
late last week after the uprising began, apparently because of
their reports from Romania. But hotels were not stopped from
showing satellite transmissions of foreign TV networks such as
Cable News Network.
   Chinese workers at one hotel clustered silently around a TV set
Tuesday as CNN showed the bodies of Ceausescu and his wife after
their execution.
   ``North Korea will be next _ that is my prediction,'' said one
Chinese intellectual, who was gleeful over Ceausescu's downfall.
But he did not believe China would follow in the domino-like
toppling of hard-line leaders.
   ``China is too big and poor,'' he said, a widespread sentiment.
   Others speculated it would only make Chinese leaders more
convinced of the correctness of their June crackdown and the need
for tighter surveillance.

   More than 400 troops loyal to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega were captured in airborne assaults and
scattered combat erupted overnight throughout parts of the capital,
U.S. military spokesmen said today.
   Noriega remained in the Vatican Embassy after seeking asylum on
Christmas Eve. The United States has demanded his surrender to face
U.S. drug charges, but church authorities refused. Spain has denied
political asylum, and there was no new word about where he might go.
   Army Lt. Col. Jerry Murgia said 440 Noriega loyalist troops and
about the same number of weapons were captured in airborne assaults
Monday on David, 200 miles to the west, and La Palma, just
southwest of Panama City.
   He also said Noriega's intelliegence chief, Col. Guillermo Wong,
surrendered Monday. Wong had been arrested after a coup attempt in
October, but was released.
   Murgia said 30,000 pounds of emergency medical supplies had
arrived in the past day and civilian relief agencies would send
workers starting today to help with redistribution.
   Twenty-three American soldiers are known to have died and
another 330 wounded, Murgia said. The figures for the number of
wounded rose because of late-arriving reports, he said. Two U.S.
dependents were killed.
   Panamanian casualties were listed as 293 killed, 123 wounded and
4,446 captured, according to U.S. military authorities. Panamanian
doctors said more than 100 civilians were killed and hundreds more
injured.
   Heavy fighting was reported overnight near a downtown sector
where many embassies are located, and the building housing the
Banco General was burned. Bank officials and U.S. soldiers said the
blaze started after American troops returned fire coming from the
building.
   There also was fighting near Santo Tomas hospital close to the
American Embassy. Caches of arms and ammunition have been found
hidden in the hospital in recent days.
   Small arms and mortar fire were heard near the Cuban Embassy,
which was surrounded by U.S. troops, as well as the Foreign
Ministry, where the U.S.-installed government of President
Guillermo Endara has set up shop.
   Cuba today said the U.S. soldiers surrounding its embassy
violated international law and asked the U.N. Security Council for
help in ending the situation, Cuban diplomats and U.N. officials
said.
   Endara, elected in May balloting that Noriega nullified, moved
Monday to consolidate his authority. First Vice President Ricardo
Arias Calderon said a governor had been appointed for six of
Panama's 10 provinces.
   Presidential spokeswoman Anel Belis called on government workers
to go back on the job today. Government services have largely been
paralyzed since the United States invaded one week ago to oust
Noriega.
   Dozens of U.S. soldiers and armored vehicles encircled the
Vatican mission after Noriega entered it Sunday. Gen. Maxwell
Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said he ordered the
embassy surrounded to prevent Noriega supporters from ``blowing
into the place.''
   Reporters saw soldiers using pellet guns to shoot out street
lights on the avenue running by the mission late Monday. They left
just four lamps lit.
   In Rome, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Monday that
``concerned parties,'' including the Endara government, would
examine Noriega's case.
   Asked if a ``simple'' turnover of Noriega to the United States
was foreseeable, Navarro replied, ``Well, I don't think so. There
isn't an extradition treaty.''
   Sources in Panama said the Vatican Embassy mentioned the
possibility of Noriega going to Spain or Cuba.
   But in Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez
Ordonez was quoted as saying, ``Spain is not the ideal country to
accept Noriega because of its extradition agreement with the United
States, which includes drug trafficking (cases).''
   American troops had surrounded the Cuban, Libyan and Nicaraguan
embassies to prevent Noriega from seeking refuge there, but none
were at the Vatican building when Noriega arrived Sunday afternoon.
   Asked why, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a news briefing in
Panama, ``We had our hands full carrying out our basic mission.''
   Cheney said he would like to bring U.S. troops home ``as soon as
possible,'' but he added, ``They will stay as long as they are
needed.''
   Panama's new foreign minister, Julio Linares, said the U.S.
invasion would ensure that the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties are
fulfilled ``as they were signed. In other words, on December 31,
1999 (the canal) will revert to Panama, as well as all its
installations.''
   A Panamanian officer who also faces drug-related charges in
Florida was escorted to Miami on Monday by U.S. drug agents, the
Justice Department said. Lt. Col. Luis del Cid surrendered to U.S.
forces in Panama on Saturday.
   U.S. troops arrested Mario Rognoni, a commerce minister under
Noriega, according to witnesses who saw him being taken from his
house. It was not known why he was apprehended.
   American military officials said most of Noriega's 15,000-member
Defense Forces had surrendered and that the resistance of his
loyalists had dwindled. Helicopters dropped thousands of ``safe
conduct passes'' in resistance areas for those who wanted to turn
themselves in to U.S. authorities.

   U.S. troops at the Cuban Embassy and the
ambassador's residence in Panama City are refusing Cuban diplomats
the right to leave or enter either location and are engaging in
threatening military activities, a Cuban official said today.
   In response, the State Department said U.S. forces ``do not
intend to prevent normal diplomatic activity by Cuban personnel.
Charges to the contrary are not true.'' The department said U.S.
troops are stationed around the Cuban Embassy and several other
places in Panama for security reasons.
   The statement did not address the specific question of access to
the Cuban missions or the Cuban claim that the troops were engaged
in threatening activities.
   Angel Pino, spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission here,
said the situation is particularly serious at the ambassador's
residence, where the Cuban diplomats and their families have been
staying since the U.S. invasion last week.
   Supplies of food and medicine are running low and the sense of
unease among those at the residence has been aggravated by
overflights of U.S. warplanes and helicopers, he said.
   The situation is ``becoming grave,'' Pino said, adding that any
incident could provoke ``unforeseeable consequences.'' He said his
government has ``protested insistently'' to American authorities.
He had no estimate of the number of Cubans at the residence.
   In a telephone interview, Pino said the Cuban government was
informed by U.S. officials in Washington and Havana over the
weekend that the situation would be resolved shortly. But there was
no change as of late morning today, Pino said.
   A State Department official said he had no information that
Cubans in Panama were being denied the right to enter or leave the
embassy grounds.
   He said a Cuban diplomat in Panama reportedly told a Cuban radio
station on Saturday that access to and from the residence was not a
problem. But Pino said U.S. troops began blocking access both ways
that same afternoon.
   The State Department official, asking not to be identified, said
the troops outside the residence and the chancery are providing
security at those locations.
   But Pino said Cuban diplomats were told by a U.S. military
officer in charge outside the residence that his instructions were
``to prevent anybody from leaving or entering the embassy.''
   He identified the U.S. officer only as Major Acksun.
   Initially U.S. officials had been concerned that Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega might try to seek refuge in either the Cuban
or Nicaraguan embassies in Panama City. The installations of both
countries were surrounded late last week, prompting the Nicaraguan
government to dispatch two tanks to the American Embassy in Managua.
   Noriega turned himself in to the Vatican Embassy in Panama City
Sunday afternoon. Pino said the U.S. troop presence at the Cuban
ambassador's residence has been reinforced since then.

<HEAD>Sakharov Last Speech Called for Pre-Trial Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov, in the speech he was writing
when he died, said legislation allowing prosecutors to prolong
maximum pre-trial detention threatened society with a return to
Stalinist times, a report said.
   The respected weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta, in its Dec. 27
editions, published a text of the speech that it said the Nobel
Peace Prize winner was working on when he collapsed and died in his
study Dec. 14.
   Other Soviet publications have said a text of the final speech
of Sakharov was circulated last weekend at the Congress of People's
Deputies, where Sakharov would have given the speech, but they have
not published it.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta did not say how it obtained the text.
   Sakharov said that by trying to lengthen the amount of time
Soviets can be held before trial, the procurator general's office
was trying to ``free its hands entirely and return the country to
the stormy times of illegality of the cult of personality,
stagnation and other rather gloomy periods.''
   The ``cult of personality'' is a reference to the rule of Josef
Stalin, during which prosecutors unencumbered by legal tradition or
judicial oversight had all of Stalin's potential opponents and many
other Soviets imprisoned or killed.
   The maximum length of time a suspect may be held has been nine
months, after which only the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet could
prolong detention.
   The new law allows the deputy procurator general to extend such
detention to one year, and for the country's top prosecutor to
extend it to 18 months.
   For decades prisoners in the Soviet Union have had no access to
a lawyer during most of their pre-trial detention.
   Soviet practice has been to allow the presence of a defense
lawyer to prepare for trial only after the prosecutor has finished
questioning the suspect and building his case.
   ``This will not improve the results of the war with crime, but
only make our already sick society more cruel,'' Sakharov's text
said. ``The whole country will justly see a new lie in the new
law.''
   Sakharov cited the laws of many Western countries limiting the
amount of time suspects can be held without trial.
   He criticized Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov for what he
said were irregularities in conducting the Supreme Soviet
legislative session Nov. 28 at which the new law was approved.
   Sakharov, 68, was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies
in March, and during the Congress session earlier on Dec. 14 had
spoken out in favor of declaring a group of reform-minded deputies
a ``political opposition'' to the Communist Party and government.

   The Vatican likely will allow Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega to go into exile in another country rather than
turn him over to the United States to face drug trafficking
charges, sources said Tuesday.
   Vatican and U.S. diplomats were at work Tuesday to resolve the
diplomatic stalemate involving Noriega, who took refuge in the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City on Sunday after four days of eluding
American invasion troops.
   An embassy spokesman said the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See,
Thomas P. Melady, has been discussing the case with high-ranking
Vatican officials but gave no details.
   The Vatican's deputy spokesman, Monsignor Piero Pennacchini,
said contacts were under way between the concerned parties,
including the newly installed Panamian government, the United
States and the Vatican.
   ``It's very delicate situation,'' Pennacchini said. ``It has to
be treated with much discretion to find the best solution for all
of the parties.''
   A State Department source in Washington said Monday the United
States had demanded ``in extraordinarily tough terms'' that the
Vatican turn Noriega over to U.S. custody for trial on drug charges.
   But church authorities had rebuffed the request and were trying,
so far unsuccessfully, to find another country to take Noriega, the
Washington official said.
   ``We want him alive to stand trial in the United States,'' the
U.S. Embassy spokesman in Panama City, Terrence Kneebone, said.
``We see this as a criminal matter. This is not a case of
poltitical or religious persecution.''
   But a Rome diplomatic source, who is close to those involved in
negotiations, on Tuesday said the possibility of the Vatican
handing over Noriega to U.S. authorities was ``very dim'' and he
would more likely go to another country.
   Spain, Cuba and the Dominican Republic have been mentioned as
possible refuges.
   A senior Vatican official, who is not directly involved in the
case but follows foreign policy issues, said ``no rules of any
kind'' would permit the Vatican to turn over Noriega to U.S.
invasion forces.
   ``They could only hand him over to the country where he's held
or arrange safe passage to another country,'' said the official,
adding that exile in a third country was the more likely solution
of the two.
   He noted that the issue of granting asylum for Noriega is not
new.
   Noriega's representatives had negotiated with the United States
in the past and again this year about the possibility of stepping
down and taking up exile in another country.
   The official also wondered how eager Washington is to bring
Noriega to the United States for trial, referring to published
reports that he might reveal embarrassing details of former links
with the CIA.
   On Monday, chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said ``I
don't think so'' when asked if the Vatican would simply turn over
Noriega to the Americans, noting the Holy See does not have an
extradition treaty with the United States.
   There were reports from Washington and Panama that the Vatican
was having trouble finding another country to accept Noriega.
   Spanish newspapers Tuesday quoted the Spanish ambassador in
Panama, Tomas Lozano Escribano, as saying Spain has formally denied
Noriega political asylum. Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez
Ordonez told the national news agency EFE on Monday that Spain was
not the ideal country for Noriega because of its extradition treaty
with the United States.
   Sources indicated it was likely a deal was struck between
Noriega and the Vatican Ebassy before he took refuge there. Under
this scenario, Noriega sought guarantees that he would not be
turned over to the Americans, while the Vatican demanded that he
renounce the conflict in Panama.
   In fact, Navarro said Noriega sought refuge at the Vatican
mission ``after having expressed his will to end the conflict.''
The spokesman indicated the Vatican knew of Noriega's position
before he showed up at the embassy.
   Analysts noted that it was unlikely Noriega would have gone to
the embassy if there was any chance he would be turned over the
Americans.
   The Vatican stressed that Noriega's move marked an opportunity
to bring peace to Panama.
   ``The legal aspect is certainly interesting,'' Navarro said on
Monday. ``But more important is the announcement that now, with his
(Noriega's) declared intention to contribute to the pacification of
the whole country, one can bring an end to the violence.''

   A Panamanian officer accused of helping deposed
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega smuggle cocaine for the Medellin
cartel was jailed in Florida today after surrendering in Panama,
the Justice Department said.
   Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, who commanded a Panama Defense Forces
unit in the province of Chiriqui, was placed in the custody of U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agents after he surrendered
Saturday, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, an agency spokeswoman in
Washington.
   He was flown to the United States under tight security Monday
and held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of
Miami, Ms. Burstion-Wade said.
   Del Cid pleaded innocent to drug-related charges today before
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler and was ordered held without
bond pending a Jan. 2 hearing.
   Del Cid, 46, repeated his claim that he turned himself in to
fight the charges. ``I surrender myself. I wanted to be brought
here,'' he told the judge through a translator.
   Frank Rubino, one of Noriega's attorneys, said he came to the
court session today to monitor the situation and arrange to speak
with del Cid, who is now represented by a public defender. Rubino
said he does not think he will defend del Cid.
   ``We are confident that we have the evidence to convict him,''
U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtenin said at a news conference this
morning before heading to del Cid's first court appearance.
   Lehtenin described del Cid as one of Noriega's ``righthand men''
and said he was the ousted Panamanian leader's liaison, courier and
emissary in drug trafficking deals with Colombian drug lords.
   Del Cid was one of 15 Noriega associates named in an indictment
unsealed Feb. 5, 1988, by a federal grand jury in Miami. He was
wanted on four counts related to cocaine possession and laundering
drug profits, the spokeswoman said.
   According to the indictment, del Cid acted as a liaison and
money courier between Colombia's Medellin cartel and Noriega. The
indictment accused Noriega of accepting a $4.6 million bribe from
the organization to protect shipments of cocaine, launder money,
supply drug laboratories and shield drug traffickers from the law.
   A federal grand jury in Tampa indicted Noriega on charges of
taking a separate $5.4 million bribe from the Colombia drug cartel.
   If convicted on all counts, del Cid could be sentenced to 70
years in prison and fined $550,000, according to Lehtinen's office.
   After del Cid's surrender, he declared loyalty to the government
of Guillermo Endara, installed as president last week after U.S.
troops invaded Panama to remove Noriega from power.
   He remained in custody in the Central American country until DEA
agents escorted him to Miami.
   ``Normally he would have been flown in by U.S. marshals, but
this was not an ordinary case,'' Ms. Burstion-Wade said.
   The Justice Department has said that if Noriega is brought to
the United States, he would be tried first in Miami because the
prosecutors' case there was stronger than in Tampa.

   A group led by the cousin of
U.S.-backed Panamanian President Guillermo Endara sent its first
shipment of medical supplies to Panama Tuesday and announced
further plans to send medicine and food.
   The estimated $50,000 worth of supplies, including plasma and
antibiotics, was accompanied by a physician to help distribute the
items at Panama City's two main hospitals.
   ``We realize this is just a small amount of what's needed, but
at this point anything is a help. These supplies are urgently
needed,'' said Luis Endara Jr., whose cousin was sworn in as
president last week after a U.S. invasion toppled the government of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The supplies, mostly donated to the Help Panama group from
several South Florida hospitals, were packed in boxes and filled
nearly every available space aboard the twin-engine Lear 25 jet.
Other items sent included syringes and needles, intravenous
solutions and orthopedic devices.
   Dr. Roberto Reyna said he would spend several hours in Panama to
allocate the 2,500 pounds of supplies before returning late Tuesday
to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
   Reyna said the group hopes the campaign for medical and food
provisions will expand nationwide.
   ``The next flight, I hope we have a 747,'' he said.
   Help Panama also has opened accounts at two Miami banks to take
donations, Luis Endara said.
   A cargo ship with six 40-foot containers of food is expected to
leave Miami on Friday for the four-day voyage to Panama, he said.
   Earlier this week, the U.S. Air Force sent medical supplies
aboard a C-5 cargo plane to Panama to aid injured civilians. The
U.S. military has not released figures on civilian casualites or
injuries.
   Luis Endara said he plans to continue relief and fund-raising
efforts in the United States and does not foresee a direct role in
his cousin's government.
   The situation at Panamanian hospitals was complicated by the
Noriega regime using medical supply areas to hide arms, according
to Roberto Dominguez, who was named the Panamanian consul in Miami
on Tuesday.
   ``It's going to take a lot more shipments like these to return
the hospitals to where they should be,'' Dominguez said.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Water Pipes Busted In Wake Of Cold Wave</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Citrus Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures rose and snow melted Tuesday in the South, but
thousands of people had no water or little pressure because of
pipes cracked by the record cold wave.
   Temperatures stayed below the freezing point overnight
throughout much of the South, but were expected to reach the 60s in
the Carolinas by the end of the week, the National Weather Service
said.
   Airlines resumed normal schedules Tuesday at Charleston, S.C.,
after reducing flights because of snow, which piled up 15 inches
deep in places along the coast Sunday. The Myrtle Beach Jetport,
closed for a third straight day Monday, was able to operate only
during daylight because runway lights were covered by snow, said
Todd Crawford, deputy airport director.
   At least 96 deaths from the Plains to the East Coast had been
blamed on the cold since Dec. 15.
   The worst of the water problems was at Jackson, Miss., where an
estimated 60,000 homes and businesses were without water or had
greatly reduced pressure. Frozen pipes had cracked but the biggest
problem was that the Pearl River had frozen around intakes for the
municipal water system.
   Jackson's city government closed Tuesday because of the water
problem and several businesses that normally use a lot of water
agreed to close Tuesday or reduce operations. Mayor Kane Ditto said
that with luck, water could restored to all areas by late Wednesday.
   Texas cities also had broken water pipes, with more than 6,000
leaks reported in Houston. Some people had been without water since
Friday.
   Plumbers were besieged with calls.
   ``The wait could be a week, if not longer,'' said Billy Duncan,
owner of Duncan's A-1 Redi Rooter Plumbing in San Antonio. ``It
depends on how fast we can get to them and how fast we can get
parts in.''
   ``We're sitting here with about 300 calls, and there's no way we
can get to all of them,'' Duncan said.
   Hotels in Houston offered discount rates for people who only
wanted to take showers.
   Taps also ran dry in Charleston. ``There's got to be thousands
of broken lines out there,'' said Steve Kinard, manager of
Charleston's public works department, which supplies water to
400,000 people.
   And in Norfolk, Va., Fire Chief George A. Ingram said: ``We've
got water mains and pipes bursting all over the city, everything
from hotels to businesses to homes.''
   In New Orleans, water pressure dropped to dangerous levels and
the Sewerage &amp; Water Board issued urgent pleas for homeowners to
find broken pipes and turn off the water. Firefighters battling a
major fire Monday were hindered by the low water pressure, Fire
Department spokesman Bob Whitman said.
   The cold caused substantial damage to Florida's $3.5 billion
citrus crop and hurt other important winter crops, agriculture
officials said Tuesday.
   Although Florida officials hadn't released citrus loss figures,
the freeze damage was likely to be substantial since much of the
crop was still on the trees when freezing temperatures began
Saturday.
   Texas state officials estimated 70 percent of their citrus crop
and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were destroyed. Losses
were estimated at $200 million. But some Texas officials and
growers predicted they would be higher because warming temperatures
ruined any hopes of salvaging the frozen fruit for juice.
   In North Carolina, power had been restored Tuesday morning to
nearly knocked by Sunday's blizzard, officials said.
   Of the 500 Cape Hatteras Electric Membership Cooperative
customers who had been without power Monday night, only the Coast
Guard station at Hatteras Inlet remained in the dark, said Sandy
Gray, a staff assistant for the cooperative.
   North Carolina Power, which had reported 5,000 people without
electricity at the height of the storm, had ``zero customers out''
Wednesday, said spokeswoman Cindy Odom.

<HEAD>Samuel Beckett, `Waiting For Godot' Playwright, Dies at 83</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Samuel Beckett, the shy, Irish-born author whose
despairing vision of the world in ``Waiting For Godot'' symbolized
the pessimistic strain in modern writing, has died in Paris, his
adopted home. He was 83.
   The poet, playwright and novelist died Friday but the death was
not announced until after a small, private funeral service Tuesday.
His publisher, Jerome Linden, said Beckett died of respiratory
failure.
   The model of an artist who makes no compromise for the sake of
popularity, the Nobel Prize-winning writer attributed his success
to ``an intuitive sense of despair.''
   ``There are no landmarks in my work,'' Beckett once said. ``We
are all adrift. We must invent a world in which to survive, but
even this invented world is pervaded by fear and guilt. Our
existence is hopeless.''
   After the announcement of his death, several mourners gathered
amid the neo-Gothic mausoleums of Montparnasse Cemetery to place
flowers on his simple granite marker.
   ``I admired him very much,'' said a French philosophy student
who lit a candle at the graveside but refused to give his name.
``I've read most of his works and found them very moving. I cannot
believe he's dead.''
   At first, Beckett's audience was limited to an intellectual
elite. But the reclusive writer and his plays, especially ``Waiting
for Godot,'' came to be emblematic of a difficult modern style of
literature even for people who never read or saw the works.
   ``He was in the forefront of modern literature,'' British
playwright Harold Pinter said Tuesday. ``He was totally original
and a man of great courage, not only in himself, but in his work.
His work knew no bounds.''
   Jack Lang, France's culture minister, called Beckett ``an
immense writer, exceptionally exacting, who has profoundly marked
his century.''
   Beckett lived in Paris since 1937, working with the Resistance
in Nazi-occupied France during World War II, for which he won the
Croix de Guerre with a gold star in 1945. He once said he preferred
``France in war to Ireland in peace.''
   He wrote some of his some works in French and some in English,
translating them himself into the other language.
   Beckett's last published work was an 1,801-word novella in March
called ``Stirrings Still,'' a meditation on old age. Only 200
copies were published and sold for $1,720 each.
   Beckett's world echoed with cries of agony and compassion at the
futility and loneliness of human existence, peopled with vagabond
couples caught in a never-ending master-slave dialogue.
   Critic J.D. O'Hara once called Beckett ``one of those artists
for whom the miseries of the world are misery.''
   The miseries first caught an audience's eye in 1952, when French
director Roger Blin rescued from obscurity Beckett's two-act fable
about two tramps waiting for a third, Godot.
   Their grim jokes are interrupted by a brutal fat man driving a
slave with a heavy burden. The fat man later returns blinded and
moves on. The tramps end the play still waiting for Godot.
   The play was translated and performed in more than 20 languages.
When it was staged last year at New York's Lincoln Center with
Robin Williams and Steve Martin as the two tramps, it sold out.
   The stunning triumph of the 1952 production focused attention on
Beckett's earlier works, with their recurring theme of the
despairing vagabond.
   Later plays developed Beckett's themes of man's losing battle
against destiny.
   In ``Endgame,'' a blind paralytic laments his fate while his
senile and crippled parents die of despair in garbage cans.
   In ``Krapp's Last Tape,'' first performed in 1969, a nearly
blind old man plays back a 30-year-old tape of his own voice and
realizes he no longer understands the words he used in his youth.
Beyond hope or ambition, he remains interested only in trivial
reminders of his sex life and other bodily functions.
   Beckett won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1969. Always
secretive about his personal life, he refused to attend the award
ceremonies in Stockholm, fleeing to Tunisia to avoid attention.
   Even the date of Beckett's birth was wrapped in mystery. He said
he was born in Dublin on Good Friday, April 13, 1906. But his
biographer, Deirdre Bair, suggested he was really born a month
earlier, with Beckett shifting it to the anniversary of the
crucifixion as a boost to his self-made legend.
   The son of a surveyor, Beckett was brought up in a comfortable,
upper-middle class Protestant household.
   He studied modern languages at Trinity College, Dublin, and
first came to Paris in 1928 to lecture in English at the
prestigious Ecole Normale Superieure.
   In Paris he met another Irish exile, James Joyce. ``Joyce had a
moral effect on me,'' Beckett said later. ``He made me realize the
meaning of artistic integrity.''
   After Beckett's father, William Beckett, died in Dublin in 1933,
his mother urged Beckett to drop literature and take up a serious
profession.
   To escape her and her family, Beckett settled permanently in
Paris in 1937.
   In 1938, Beckett was stabbed in a Paris street brawl. A woman
passing by on her bicycle stopped to help the gravely injured man
and have him taken to a hospital.
   That woman, Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil, became his lifelong
companion and they finally married in 1961. She died in July. The
couple had no children.

   The Bush administration today announced an
emergency $500,000 package of humanitarian aid to Romania, after
recognizing its provisional government.
   At the same time, the United States voiced regret that the trial
of executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, was
conducted in secret.
   ``We would have preferred it if there had been a public trial,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He said the $500,000 in aid would be made available by the U.S.
Agency for International Development to the International Red
Cross. He said further U.S. aid also was likely.
   Romania has been devastated by bitter street battles between the
army and security forces loyal to Ceausescu.
   A hot line is being set up today at the State Department to
handle the many calls from Americans and Romanians wanting to
donate food and medicine.
   ``The U.S. government today established diplomatic relations
with the new legitimate government of Romania, the National
Salvation Front,'' said a statement issued by the White House on
Monday. The National Salvation Front is the name adopted by the
reform-minded leadership, which assumed control of Romania after
Ceausescu was deposed last week.
   ``The United States government pledges its support to the new
Romanian government as it struggles to achieve its announced
democratic values,'' said the U.S. statement.
   It was issued a short while after Bucharest Radio reported that
Ceausescu and his wife were executed Monday after a secret trial
that found them guilty of killing more than 60,000 Romanians and
the stealing more than $1 billion from the country.
   ``We regret the trial did not take place in an open and public
fashion. We urge an end to all violence and bloodshed in Romania,''
the U.S. statement said.
   The statement said President Bush was informed by National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft of the executions when Scowcroft
went to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., to discuss the
situation in Panama.
   The Romanian Embassy issued a statement saying it had notified
the State Department of the executions and the charges against the
deposed couple. A State Department official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said that unless informed otherwise by the new
Bucharest government, the United States considers the existing
ambassador and his staff as official representatives.
   Diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest have already been in
touch with the new government to arrange safe passage for 42
government personnel and their dependents who were evacuated Sunday
to neighboring Bulgaria, said State Department spokesman Adam Shub.
   He said the 31-car convoy of foreigners that drove to the
Bulgarian border also carried 26 other Americans.

<HEAD>Months of Political Turmoil Releases Wave of Dark Humor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lights and decorations brighten the city on
both sides of the Berlin Wall during the Christmas season, but dark
humor holds sway in the streets of the still-divided city.
   For decades, jokes poking fun at the once-mighty Communist
regime remained among family and friends in East Berlin, but biting
humor surfaced openly this fall with the decline of the Communists
and the secret police.
   Most of the jokes floating across the now-porous borders focus
on ousted East German leader Erich Honecker and the corrupt
Communist Party he once headed, as well as the rotten economic
situation he left behind.
   A favorite joke concerns the future of the East German flag with
the familiar compass and sickle emblem embroidered on the
orange-and-black national colors. An unadorned version serves as
the West German flag.
   ``What is the new emblem for the flag?'' goes the question. ``A
suitcase,'' is the answer _ a reference to the more than 320,000
East Germans who have left for West Germany in search of a better
life this year alone.
   Although Honecker, who is reportedly seriously ill, was stripped
of power on Oct. 18 and has been in seclusion ever since,
variations of jokes about him are told over and over in bars,
stores and taxis.
   ``Why has Honecker checked into a hotel on the Hungarian
border?'' asks one East German. ``Because all the best doctors pass
by there,'' replies another.
   Other jokes concern the East German Communist Party, which has
lost some 700,000 members since the political trouble began earlier
this year.
   ``What does a party member who finds one new party member get?''
went a joke that circulated during a recent party congress that
swept away remnants of the old guard. ``He gets to leave the
party.''
   ``What does a party member who enrolls 10 new members get?'' the
joke continues. ``A certificate that he was never a party member,''
goes the reply.
   A few of the jokes are simply unquotable. ``I know a lot of
jokes, But you could never print them and this isn't the right
place to tell them,'' said an East German border guard at the
famous Checkpoint Charlie crossing point.
   Not all of the humor is aimed at East Germany. West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a target of sometimes vicious jokes in his
homeland, has found similar treatment in East Germany.
   Some East Germans have welcomed the West German leader. ``Lieber
Kohl als Sauerkraut,'' or ``Better Kohl than Sauerkraut,'' read one
banner displayed in Dresden during Kohl's trip there earlier this
week. The word Kohl means cabbage in German.

<TEXT>
   William C. McLucas, a senior lawyer at the
Securities and Exchange Commission, was named today as the new head
of enforcement of the SEC.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, in his first major decision since
taking over as head of the SEC in October, made the announcement of
McLucas' appointment at a news conference.
   The nomination of an enforcement director does not require
Senate confirmation, but it is considered the second-most powerful
position at the agency because it is the enforcement division which
has the job of policing the multibillion-dollar securities industry.
   McLucas, a senior SEC enforcement lawyer, had been considered a
top contender to get the nod to succeed Gary Lynch, who announced
he was stepping down last May after serving for four years as the
head of enforcement.
   Lynch received widespread praise for the job he did in breaking
open a series of big insider trading cases, beginning with the
exposure of stockbroker Dennis Levine, continuing through a $100
million settlement with speculator Ivan Boesky and culminating with
the settlement of a massive civil fraud case with junk bond-giant
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Lynch took over the enforcement division at a time of turmoil
for the SEC after his predecessor, John Fedders, stepped down amid
allegations that he beat his wife.
   Lynch was credited with restoring morale at the agency and
spearheading a series of major investigations.
   In May 1986, the SEC filed charges against Levine, whose
cooperation led to Boesky, who in turn implicated Drexel Burnham in
the largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government.
   The scandals in recent years have forced Wall Street's big
brokerage houses to re-evaluate their compliance and ethics codes
and led Congress to increase the penalties for insider trading.

   The Bush administration announced its
intention today to seize millions of dollars in assets that deposed
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega allegedly shipped out of Panama,
while it continued diplomatic efforts to bring him to trial in the
United States on drug charges.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the assets are
all liquid and are primarily in bank accounts in half a dozen
countries, many of them in Europe. They amount to ``in excess of
$10 million,'' he said.
   He refused to name the countries where Noriega placed his money,
which the spokesman referred to as ``illegal drug money.''
   Noriega touched off a behind-the-scenes diplomatic struggle on
Sunday when he presented himself at the Vatican Embassy in Panama
City and asked for asylum. U.S. troops have surrounded the facility.
   President Bush remained at his Camp David retreat, while an aide
said he was monitoring the situation closely. Bush sent roughly
14,000 troops to Panama a week ago in an effort to restore
democracy there and apprehend Noriega.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today the
administration has told the Vatican ``very directly'' of its desire
to Noriega returned to the United States to stand trial.
   At the same time, Fitzwater declined to rule out the possibility
that some other option might be under consideration in the
international negotiations that began over the weekend when Noriega
turned up at the Vatican Embassy in Panana City requesting asylum.
Sources have said the discussions have included sending Noriega to
a third country.
   Runkel told reporters that Noriega has ``10 associate thugs'' in
the Papal Nunciature with him. Runkel said he did not know their
names.
   ``Our position is we mean to bring him back to the United
States,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said this was the primary goal, although he would not rule
out the possiblity that some other option might be under
consideration. The Vatican has ruled out simply turning Noriega
over to the United States, according to a spokesman who noted that
the Holy See does not have an extradition treaty with the United
States.
   Fitzwater said U.S.troops would continue to ring the Vatican
Embassy ``as long as he's there.''
   Although Bush has not directly communicated with Pope John Paul
II on the subject, or with other Vatican officials, ``we told them
very directly what our feelings were,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said that the United States had offered Noriega,
wanted in Florida on drug trafficking charges, a deal as recently
as October in exchange for his stepping down from power
voluntarily. But he did not accept it and now such deals are off,
Fitzwater said.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said today that when Noriega
turned himself in at the Vatican Embassy he was ``said to be so
exhausted from the chase that he could barely speak.'' He said
Noriega had been on the run since the U.S. operations began on
Tuesday and that he was never in command of the Panamanian Defense
Forces resisting U.S. soldiers.
   Williams also said the Panama Canal was now open 24 hours and
Panama City's two major airports, Torrijos and Tocumen, are open
during limited hours.
   ``It's much quieter in Panama City than it has been since the
operation began,'' Williams said.
   He said some U. S. troops remained in city streets and others
were moving west ``to check the countryside.'' He said they were
meeting very little resistance, with citizens turning in their
weapons to U.S. soldiers.
   The spokesman said about 33,000 weapons have been captured,
discovered or turned in, including 6,000 under a program which
offers rewards to former PDF members who give up their arms.
   Earlier, an administration source said that the United States
was talking in ``extraordinarily tough terms'' in its bid to
convince the Vatican to turn over Noriega.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, just back from a Christmas Day
visit with the 26,000 troops in Panama, said today he hoped a
quieting situation will allow the United States to speed up the
withdrawal of some American forces. But in an interview with ABC
News he did not provide a timetable for troop movements.
   Papal representatives have contacted several Latin American and
European countries in hopes one will agree to accept Noriega, said
the U.S. official. He described the situation as ``a Mexican
standoff.''
   ``He has no place to go yet,'' the official said. ``Nobody wants
him.''
   The White House disputed an account in today's editions of the
Washington Post that Bush had talked by telephone Monday with the
papal nuncio in Panama, Monsignor Sebastian Laboa. Popadiuk said
Bush engaged in no such conversation.
   The Post also said Cuba indicated it would be willing to give
political asylum to Noriega.
   Spain, Cuba and the Dominican Republic were mentioned in the
past as possible exile sites when Noriega's representatives were
negotiating with the United States in 1988 and again this year
about the possibility of Noriega stepping down.
   But Spain might not be acceptable to Noriega because it has an
extradition treaty with the United States. And Cuba might not be
palatable to the United States because that country would reject
any U.S. request for Noriega to be turned over to U.S. custody.
   The State Department official said most of the discussions have
been carried out between the State Department and church officials
at the Vatican.

<HEAD>Motorists Save Stranded Woman From Freeway Attacker</HEAD>

   A band of motorists plunged across a busy
stretch of freeway on Christmas Day to save a woman in a stalled
car who was the target of a sexual assault, police said Tuesday.
   The passers-by thwarted a rape and risked their lives by running
across Interstate 5, known as the Golden State Freeway, to help the
woman, police said.
   ``It makes you feel good when you stop and realize there are
good people out there. It's something to risk running across the
I-5 freeway, which had pretty heavy traffic at that time,'' Police
Officer Gary Williams said.
   Pedro Sanchez, 20, of Santa Clarita, was booked for
investigation of attempted rape, Detective Steve Brazner said. Bail
was set at $12,500 pending arraignment Wednesday.
   The woman and her infant were alone in her northbound car when
it broke down near the junction of the interstate and the Antelope
Valley Freeway, about 25 miles north of downtown in the Sylmar area.
   The woman telephoned her boyfriend for help and was awaiting his
arrival when a car with four men inside stopped. One of them forced
his way inside, Brazner said.
   ``As her boyfriend pulled up, he witnessed her struggling with
the man,'' the detective said. Several motorists traveling in the
southbound freeway lanes at the same time also witnessed the
commotion, he said.
   The motorists stopped and ran across the freeway to help capture
Sanchez, who fled into nearby bushes along with the three other
men, authorities said.
   The 21-year-old woman, a resident of the Canyon Country area of
Santa Clarita, was sexually assaulted, but the motorists'
intervention prevented a rape, the officials said.
   She was treated for minor bruises at Holy Cross Hospital in
Mission Hills.

   Indianapolis Colts rookie wide receiver
Andre Rison was driving 128 mph on his way home to Michigan for
Christmas, according to police who pulled him over in a 55 mph zone
in his 1989 Mercedes.
   ``He told the officer he thought he was driving between 95 and
100 mph because he said that's what it feels like when you're
driving 55 mph in a regular car,'' said Sgt. Dallard Tackett of the
State Police post at Fort Wayne.
   Rison was taken to jail, but released within an hour Christmas
morning after he posted $500 bond.
   Rison was the Colts' top draft pick out of Michigan State. The
Colts' season ended Sunday after a 41-6 loss to New Orleans.

reading and relaxing away from his home state.
   ``I think the older you get, birthdays have less significance,''
Bayh said of his lack of party plans. ``And some people say, given
my age, a few more birthdays could be helpful.'' His big treat for

   ``I don't have time to do much leisure reading,'' Bayh told the

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor raked in 11 votes in a
nationwide poll to pick the year's top whiner.
   That made her the winner over ``Today'' show host Bryant Gumbel,
former First Lady Nancy Reagan and Tammy Faye Bakker, wife of
former PTL ministry leader Jim Bakker.
   Gabor apparently pulled ahead of the crowd to be honored for
National Whiners' Day on Tuesday because of her conviction this
year for slapping a police officer.
   The results of the poll _ 45 votes were cast from around the
country _ were announced by Kevin C. Zaborney, who says he invented
Whiner's Day four years ago because of his experiences working in a
fast-food restaurant.
   ``There was a girl who would whine about everything and
anything,'' he said. ``There are people who are whiners and she was
a whiner. Jokingly, I said, `There should be a National Whiner's
Day.'''
   Zaborney picked the day after Christmas, already a traditional
day for whining about the misfit presents under the Christmas tree.
   Family Circle magazine asked readers to send in their
nominations for this year's top whiner, that's how Zaborney
compiled the 45 votes.

   Musician Neil Young is taking the bitter with
the sweet. His recent album ``Freedom'' has been critically
acclaimed but isn't getting much radio play time to display its
creative wares.
   ``Freedom'' recently hit a modest No. 35 on the Billboard
charts, even though music critics have praised it lavishly. Young
says he fails to get radio play time because he has dared to be
experimental with his work during the past decade, and because he
often gets boxed in as a ``classic rock'' artist on tightly
formatted radio stations.
   ``If something doesn't fit a station's image or sound, then it
doesn't get played,'' Young said in a recent interview. ``And there
are certain stations that won't play me regardless of what the
record is like. They don't want to play music that their parents
listened to because it doesn't fit their image.''
   Pop music critics have hailed ``Freedom'' as the most accessible
and interesting work Young has done since such hit records as
1970's ``After the Gold Rush'' and 1972's ``Harvest.''

   Timothy Curry took his first name from
an old newspaper, his last from some writing he spotted on the wall
of a soup kitchen.
   Curry can't recall his real name or where he came from. Indeed
he can't remember anything from before January 1988.
   He said that's when he woke up in a Boston bus station, his mind
a total blank.
   ``I feel like a lunatic sometimes because I don't know who I am.
I have no identity. The only thing I know is how to live on the
street,'' said Curry, who appears to be in his 20s.
   Susan Grislis, director of the Rhode Island affiliate of
Literacy Volunteers of America, tested Curry and concluded he has
at least a high school education.
   But Curry said he was unfamiliar with World War I and Watergate.
He knows the Beatles were a rock group because he read about them
in Boston, but doesn't know their songs.
   Curry lived on the streets of Boston, afraid to seek help
because he thought they would ``lock me up in a mental hospital and
I wouldn't get out.''
   He was befriended by a Bellingham, Mass., construction worker
who spotted him near Fenway Park in August 1988. Ralph Guisti, 54,
visited Curry weekly and sometimes gave him money for food.
   ``He didn't look human,'' Guisti said of his friend with
deep-green eyes and a scraggly brown beard. ``He was a person in
need.''
   After months of urging, Guisti persuaded Curry to go to the
homeless shelter in Woonsocket, about five miles from Bellingham,
and get help. Curry arrived Oct. 24 and can stay six months.
   Shelter officials and Woonsocket police take Curry's claim of
amnesia seriously.
   ``I haven't found anything to indicate that he might be
feigning,'' said shelter director Paul Dempster. ``It's genuine.''
He said Curry does not smoke, drink or use drugs.
   Woonsocket police sent Curry's fingerprints to the FBI, which
determined he has no criminal or military record.
   The police also distributed Curry's description _ 5 feet 7, 145
pounds _ to police departments nationwide.
   So far, the police have turned up nothing.
   ``If it turns out that this individual doesn't have much in way
of family, then we might run into a roadblock,'' said Detective Lt.
Michael Richardson. ``If nobody's filed a missing person report,
there's nothing we can do about it.''
   Curry has undergone psychological counseling at the Northern
Rhode Island Community Mental Health Center.
   Richard Crino, a registered psychiatric nurse, said it is
impossible to diagnose Curry's problem until he takes some more
medical tests. He said several illnesses, including a brain tumor,
epilepsy and alcoholism, can produce memory loss.
   To rule out an organic cause, officials at the health center
ordered a brain scan, physical examination, blood tests and a test
that checks the brain's electrical potential. Curry has taken the
first two, but refuses to take the others.
   He said the brain scan made his eyes sensitive to light and
irritated his sinuses.
   Curry said he struggles to regain his memory.
   ``I'd look at people and try to picture what my relatives must
look like,'' he said. ``But there's nothing for me to remember.''
   Dempster said he would like Curry to get a driver's license and
Social Security card in his adopted name soon, ``so he can start
living a normal lifestyle.''
   For his part, Curry said, ``The only thing I can think of is if
the police find my identity, or my memory comes back. That's the
only hope I have.''

<HEAD>China Claims Mao Revival As Chairman's 96th Birthday Marked</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China marked the 96th birthday of Mao Tse-tung on
Tuesday amid official claims that young people disillusioned with
Western philosophies are rediscovering truth in the works of the
late Great Helmsman.
   The official press says there is a quiet resurgence of interest
in Mao, the father of Communist China who, since his death in 1976,
has also been blamed for bringing great suffering to China with his
radical policies.
   Young people, the media report, have abandoned their Sartre and
Nietzsche and have returned to the works of Mao, Marx and Lenin.
   College students, Shanghai's Wen Hui Daily said, after traveling
the ``winding road'' of fascination with Western thought, ``have
returned to our forefathers to ask for advice. ... Is this not a
good omen?''
   The implication is that college students, after the government's
bloody suppression of their pro-democracy movement this year and
months of heavy political indoctrination, now realize that Mao and
Marx were right all along.
   Young people questioned privately said they had heard of no one
rushing out to buy ``The Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung.''
   ``Mao is a kind of cover,'' said one graduate student.
``Journalists have to perform their job, they have to write
something'' and Mao is a safe subject that adheres to party line,
he said.
   Crowds at Mao's mausoleum in Tiananmen Square, where his body
lies in state, were far smaller on his birthday Tuesday than in
previous years. A bitingly cold Siberian wind may have kept many
away, as did the continuation of martial law in Beijing that limits
access to the square to those with proper IDs.
   One vender outside the mausoleum said 10,000 to 20,000 people a
day viewed Mao's body before June. Now, the number is 4,000 to
5,000 daily.
   The overseas edition of the official People's Daily Tuesday
reported the increased popularity of Shaoshan, Mao's birthplace in
rural southern China. It said Shaoshan will receive 600,000
visitors this year, up from last year but still far below the
nearly 3 million pilgrims a year during Mao's lifetime.
   The daily also said Mao's 96th birthday was being marked with
the release of a tape titled ``A Truly Great Man of No Equal In His
Time'' on which 12 of Mao's poems are set to traditional music. A
book chronicling Mao's family line back to the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368) was also published.
   However, a check of several bookstores found neither tape nor
works by Mao. A clerk at one of Beijing's larger bookshops said
Mao's works had been sold out since June, but a saleswoman at a
smaller shop said, ``we haven't carried Mao's works for five
years.''
   Another clerk corrected her, saying, ``we haven't carried them
for 20 years. Every family already has his works, so there's no
need to buy them.''
   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Mao's disastrous attempt
to purge the bureaucracy and restore ideological purity to the
revolution, all Chinese were required to possess his ``Little Red
Book'' of quotations and study from it daily.
   Official reports of a revival of interest in Mao have also been
tempered by warnings against nostalgia for the personality cult
around Mao that his successor, Deng Xiaoping, has tried to eschew.
   ``Everyone knows that Mao Tse-tung was a man and not a god,''
the Beijing Daily said.
   It quoted Deng as saying Mao was a great man and ``if it were
not for Chairman Mao our country would have groped in the dark for
an even longer period of time.'' But it cautioned against ``great
mass fervor among young students'' for the Great Helmsman.
   There is little sign of that, although some Chinese embittered
by the government's corruption and harsh suppression of democratic
reform look back fondly on the revolutionary ideals represented by
Mao in the early days of the People's Republic.
   ``People prefer Mao to now,'' said the graduate student. ``The
present government is too corrupt. At least Mao was for the
people.''

<HEAD>Neighbors Say Ex-Cop Accused of Killing Ailing Wife Doted on Her</HEAD>

   Retired policeman Gerald Williams doted on his
ailing wife for years. But, faced with heart surgery and worried
that he could no longer care for her, he shot and killed her on
Christmas Eve, police say.
   Both authorities and neighbors say Alice Williams had begged him
to end her suffering, but he still faces first-degree murder
charges.
   ``He was a very loving, caring man,'' said neighbor Marie
Kitzmiller. ``He took care of her from morning until night, around
the clock.''
   Williams, 67, appeared briefly in court Tuesday, accused of
shooting his wife of 44 years in the head with a .38-caliber
revolver while she sat in a wheelchair in the dining room of their
brick bungalow.
   Williams declined to comment to reporters after his appearance
before Criminal Court Judge David Erickson. The judge scheduled
another appearance for Jan. 12, and Williams remained free on a
personal recognizance bond.
   Mrs. Williams, 64, had suffered for 20 years from multiple
sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the nervous system, and also
had heart and kidney problems, said police Sgt. Ronald Palmer.
   After the shooting, Williams telephoned police to turn himself
in and waited for them at home, the officer said. He was released
into his daughter's custody after a Christmas Day court hearing.
   ``His health wasn't the best and hers was deteriorating,''
Palmer said. He said Williams had learned that a heart problem for
which he had to undergo surgery two years ago had recurred.
   ``He said he would be unable to take care of his wife and
himself,'' Palmer said. Palmer said Williams told police that ``all
his wife did was complain about how much she was suffering and she
begged him to end it.''
   Williams' daughter told police she had spoken to her father
earlier Sunday and that he told her his doctor had advised him that
he required a second major heart operation and he wouldn't be able
to care for his wife, Palmer said.
   ``I know Gerry was taking her to the doctors quite frequently,''
said Ms. Kitzmiller. ``She was totally confined to a wheelchair,
and she had taken a turn for the worse in the last six months.''
   Williams joined the force in 1957 and retired in 1985, said
Officer Patrick Camden.
   During his 28-year career, Williams was awarded 30 honorable
mentions, one department commendation and five complimentary
letters, ``about average for an aggressive policeman,'' Camden said.
   Calls to Williams' home went unanswered Tuesday and his
attorney, James E. Gorman, did not return several telephone
messages.
   ``He was a very nice man,'' said Chester Ciezczak, another
neighbor. ``He seemed to always help his wife. ... He cared for her
very much.''
   Ciezczak, who lives across the street from the Williams home,
said he did not hear the shooting Sunday.
   ``We ... saw all the squad cars and the ambulance and the fire
department,'' he said. ``The first thing that came to my mind was
that she had died, like on her own, because everybody knew that she
was in very bad health.''
   Said Ed Hearnes, another neighbor: ``To take a life that way, I
couldn't visualize Gerry doing that.''

   Samuel Beckett repeatedly refused to explain his
own work, leaving it to critics and audiences to interpret, puzzle
over and argue about the writings of one of the 20th century's
greatest playwrights.
   ``I meant what I said,'' was all he would ever offer about a
body of work that encompassed the darkest of despair about the
human condition in scores of plays, novels and poems that defied
convention.
   He didn't write plots. He didn't construct plays with stories to
tell. His masterpiece was ``Waiting for Godot,'' the tale of two
tramp-like figures, Estragon and Vladimir, waiting for the
mysterious Godot, who never arrives. It had no beginning and no
end. Futility and funny business exist side by side. When asked for
a summary of the play, the great clown Bert Lahr, who played
Estragon on Broadway, said simply, ``It's about two bums.''
   The play's history in the United States mirrors Beckett's
gradual acceptance by American critics and audiences. In early
1956, it had a disastrous tryout in Florida where two-thirds of the
opening-night audience walked out after the first act. ``Playing
`Waiting for Godot' in Miami was like doing `Giselle' at
Roseland,'' Lahr said later.
   Partially recast and with a new director, the play opened on
Broadway to widely divergent reaction. Columnist Walter Winchell
vilified it. Audiences were mystified, and so were many of the
reviewers. Critic Brooks Atkinson called it ``a mystery wrapped in
an enigma,'' adding that ``Theatergoers can rail at it, but they
cannot ignore it.'' But ``Waiting for Godot'' folded after a run of
only 59 performances.
   ``It has taken the world a little while to catch up with Sam
Beckett,'' said Alvin Epstein, who was in the original Broadway
production of ``Godot.'' ``The source of his greatness is that he
tapped into the universal unconscious of Western society in the
20th century. He expressed something so deeply felt by people who
were shook up by war, destruction and technology. He was not really
a writer, he was a visionary.''
   Thirty-two years later, there were no quibbles about ``Waiting
for Godot'' when Mike Nichols directed an all-star version starring
Steve Martin and Robin Williams at New York's Lincoln Center.
Whatever their thoughts about the particular production, critics
and audiences embraced the play as a modern masterpiece.
   Beckett's influence on other playwrights was enormous. Edward
Albee, Harold Pinter, David Mamet and particularly Tom Stoppard, in
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,'' acknowledged
Beckett's hold over them in his use of language, time and images.
   Beckett's plays are filled with indelible images, most of them
of people trapped, unable to move or even sometimes to speak. In
``Endgame,'' one character cannot sit, another cannot stand, while
two more are encased in trashcans. In ``Rockaby,'' an old woman,
rocking slowly in a chair, confronts death. In ``Play,'' three
voices are imprisoned in large earthen jars. In ``Happy Days,'' a
woman is buried up to her neck in sand.
   As he grew older, his plays became more minimalistic _ and more
nihilistic. In ``Acts Without Words,'' he wrote a play with no
dialogue, only sounds. In ``Not I,'' a one-character play he wrote
for actress Billie Whitelaw, only the outline of the draped
performer is visible with a spotlight focused on her mouth.
   ``He was to playwriting what Einstein was to physics in the 20th
century,'' said Gregory Mosher, artistic director of the Lincoln
Center Theater. ``After he figured out what he did, which seems so
simple and obvious because it was so true, nothing ever was the
same afterwards. It's the idea that all that's left to us is trying
to live a decent life in a world that has gone completely nuts.
Take Woody Allen's great joke: `90 percent of life is just showing
up.' That's a line straight out of Samuel Beckett.''

   Israeli warplanes destroyed a Communist
Party command post south of Beirut Tuesday, hours after
paratroopers backed by tanks and air cover wiped out another
Communist base in southeastern Lebanon.
   Police said nine people were killed and 26 wounded in the two
attacks.
   In Beirut, the Lebanese army defused a car rigged with 165
pounds of explosives near Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office 30
minutes before it was set to go off, police said.
   ``A bloodbath has been averted,'' said a police spokesman. Hoss,
a Sunni Moslem, was at home five blocks away when the bomb was
discovered and did not appear to be the target, the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
   Police said at least seven people were killed and 23 wounded in
the five-minute air raid that wrecked the two-story Communist Party
headquarters in the coastal town of Rmeile, 20 miles south of the
capital.
   The building took at least two direct rocket hits as six Phantom
F-4 fighter-bombers attacked it. Rescuers searched the wreckage for
more victims late Tuesday. Reporters heard moans and screams from
beneath the debris.
   Among those killed was Communist commander codenamed Abu Rabei,
who just before his death screamed for his 22-year-old daughter,
still buried in the ruins.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said its warplanes
returned to their bases. It said the Communists had organized and
launched attacks on Israeli forces and the South Lebanon Army, an
Israeli-backed Lebanese militia.
   Police said two other Communist guerrillas were killed and three
wounded as Israeli paratroopers earlier destroyed the Communist
base at Nabi Safi, in the foothills of Mount Hermon 7{ miles north
of the zone Israel occupies in south Lebanon.
   The two-hour assault was the Israeli army's heaviest ground
operation in Lebanon since an assault against the Syrian-backed
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command Dec.
9, 1988.
   The attack force of 100 commandos advanced from the border
enclave, occupied by Israel since 1982, in four tanks and eight
armored personnel carriers behind a massive artillery barrage,
police reported.
   The attackers stormed through the villages of Kfar Meshki and
Lebbaya in the eastern Bekaa Valley after two helicopter gunships
blasted the villages with eight rockets, destroying many houses,
the spokesman said.
   Forty other paratroopers were then dropped by helicopters in
Nabi Safa, where they blew up the Communists' two-story command
post, the spokesman added.
   The Israeli military said their side suffered no casualties. But
a Communist Party statement in Beirut said ``the enemy suffered
heavy losses in lives and ammunition at the hands of our heroes who
fought hand-to-hand to repulse the attack.''
   The villages have long been used by the Communists and other
leftist Lebanese and Palestinian guerrilla factions allied with
Syria to attack the Israeli-held zone.
   Also Tuesday, police said heavy artillery duels raged Tuesday in
south Lebanon about 15 miles west of Nabi Safa between the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-allied
Amal.
   The two militias also clashed with machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades in the Shiite slums of Hay el-Lija in
west Beirut after midday. There were no reports of casualties in
Beirut.
   Police have reported at least 38 people killed and 150 wounded
in the south since Saturday in a renewed power struggle between the
rival groups for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect.

<HEAD>Independent Review Says Virginia Guard Acted Professionally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Virginia Army National Guard performed
``in a highly professional manner'' during Labor Day disturbances
in Virginia Beach, according to findings of an independent review
announced Tuesday by the National Guard Bureau.
   Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr., chief of the bureau, said the
review was conducted by a team led by Brig. Gen. John H. McDonald
of Delaware Army National Guard at the request of Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen.
John Warner, R-Va.
   He said the reviewers found no evidence to support contentions
that delays in deployment of the Guard on the morning of Sept. 3
contributed to the damage from looting and vandalism.
   The study showed that alert and call-up procedures ``worked
remarkably well considering the number of troops mobilized and
deployed, the short time period that elapsed between initial alert
and actual deployment, and the fact that it took place in the
middle of America's busiest summer holiday weekend.''
   Temple said no instance of physical abuse by a National Guard
member had been verified during the disturbances Sept. 1-5. He said
several members of the Guard received minor injuries, but none
required hospitalization.

<HEAD>Government of King Hussein Loosens Martial Law Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of King Hussein on Tuesday
removed most categories of crimes from the military courts,
significantly easing Jordan's 22-year-old martial law.
   State Jordan Television said the cabinet, acting on the wishes
of Hussein, gave civil courts jurisdiction over cases ranging from
political offenses to price hike violations and homicide.
   The action is the last in a series of liberalizing measures in
the kingdom, which this year held its first general elections in
more than two decades and reversed a controversial 1988 law that
nationalized all daily newspapers.
   The changes were sparked by four days of rioting in April in
which at least 10 people died following price hikes of many
subsidized goods and services and the appearance of government
indifference to the economic situation of many Jordanians.
   The cabinet said civil courts will immediately start handling
cases involving firearms, gunplay at weddings, homicide, price
gouging, forgery, assaults on officials, violations of martial law
orders and the ban on membership in political parties, as well as
the law against communism.
   Military courts have handled such cases since martial law was
imposed during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, in which Jordan lost the
West Bank _ with much of its economy and population _ to Israel.
   The cabinet also said that a ministerial committee will study
whether to remove economic and security offenses from martial law
jurisdiction, and will report its findings within two months.
   The action comes the same week that the newly appointed
government of Prime Minister Mudar Badran must by law seek a vote
of confidence from the recently elected parliament, most of whose
members campaigned for an end to martial law.
   The king earlier this year promised to limit martial law.

   Special presents arrived Christmas Eve
for two soldiers fighting supporters of deposed Gen. Manuel Noriega
in Panama _ their wives each gave birth to a baby girl.
   There was some indication that both new fathers were hoping for
future paratroopers, but one new mother took it in stride. ``We've
got paratrooper women,'' Courtny Hollands, 26, said from her
hosptial bed at Fort Bragg's Womack Army Community Hospital, where
she gave birth to Lindsay Suzanne.
   Staff Sgt. Curtis Rosenbaum of the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st
Squadron received a message Christmas Day about his new daughter,
Ashley Ann, who was born to his wife, Becky. He called home to
confirm the good news.
   ``He said, `Is it true? Is it true?''' said Mrs. Rosenbaum's
mother, Linda Glidewell of Hico, Texas.
   Rosenbaum called his wife Saturday and found out she was in
labor, Mrs. Rosenbaum, 22, said. ``He was going, `Can't you wait
three weeks?''' she said.
   Mrs. Glidewell said she thinks her son-in-law was surprised that
the child is a girl.
   ``I think they were expecting a boy because he wanted a
paratrooper,'' she said.
   Capt. Dave Hollands, 29, of 3rd Battalion, 319th Artillery, was
sent word Christmas Day about his daughter's birth, but Mrs.
Hollands said she had not yet spoken with her husband.
   ``I did get a message sixth-hand (saying) `Did she have my son
yet?' Typical man,'' she said.
   The babies were the first for both couples.

   The freeze that struck Florida citrus and
vegetable crops should drive up food prices somewhat, but not very
much, an Agriculture Department expert said Tuesday.
   The expert, Ralph Parlett of the department's Economic Research
Service, said an earlier forecast that food prices generally may
rise 3 percent to 5 percent next year is still valid.
   Overall food prices are up an average of about 5.7 percent this
year, the largest annual gain since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981.
Much of this year's increase was due to lingering effects of the
1988 drought and poor weather early in 1989.
   ``I'm not worried about my overall forecast (for 1990) at this
point,'' Parlett said in a telephone interview. ``But there'll be
some impact, and possibly higher prices in the first quarter.''
   Parlett said he and other agency analysts are ``still trying to
assess the damage'' to citrus and vegetable crops in Florida.
   ``The main thing is oranges,'' he said. ``Vegetables _ tomatoes,
bell peppers, celery _ they're some of the big volume things that
would be coming out of Florida now.''
   Parlett said 90 percent of the Florida oranges are for
processing and that a lot of them can be salvaged for juice. The
main source of ``fresh market'' oranges is California.
   ``There will be some (retail) price impact,'' he said. ``But
since we do have decent supplies in California this year ... the
supply impact will be minimal.''
   With the supply of Florida orange juice reduced by the freezing
weather, Parlett said imports from Brazil will probably rise
sharply.
   ``We've got super supplies in Brazil this year, but the price
has been fairly low because of the higher supplies,'' he said.
``But now that we probably will be importing, that will push the
price up some.''
   Parlett said he had not seen damage reports from Texas, where
state officials have estimated losses of 70 percent of the citrus
and 80 percent of the winter vegetables.
   Vegetable losses are ``a more temporary kind of thing'' because
those crops can be replanted, he said. Growers were just starting
to harvest Florida's main supply of winter vegetables when the cold
weather struck.
   California is still producing vegetables, however, and ``this
time of year we start getting produce out of Mexico, too,'' Parlett
said.
   ``There's no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short,
and we'll probably see higher prices'' at produce counters, he said.

   The government of President
Carlos Menem suffered an economic setback Tuesday when the
Argentine currency lost 27 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar in a single day.
   At the close of the business day, foreign exchange houses
offered 1,700 australs for each dollar. Last Friday, the market
rate was 1,230 australs per dollar. Banks were closed Monday for
Christmas.
   After weeks of pressure against the austral, the government Dec.
10 formally devalued the currency by 34 percent, bringing the
official and free market rates briefly in parity.
   However, the austral plunge anew after interest rates soared as
did prices and wage demands by workers. On Dec. 15, Economy
Minister Nestor Rapanelli resigned, and his successor, Antonio
Gonzalez, three days later freed the exchange rate and lifted most
price controls.
   Menem has struggled with the economy ever since taking office
July 8. Gonzalez is Menem's third economy minister, and Rodolfo
Rossi is the third Central Bank president.
   So far this year, Argentina has had six economy ministers and
five Central Bank presidents.

   Ambassador Ion Stoichici and a few aides
struggled to conduct diplomacy from the barricaded, egg-splattered
Romanian Embassy Tuesday, consulting with U.S. officials and
helping Romanians who want to return home.
   The embassy was closed while the staff shifted gears and
loyalties from the deposed Nicolae Ceausescu to the revolutionary
National Salvation Committee, which televised pictures of the
executed despot and his wife Tuesday morning.
   ``We have the same feelings as other Romanians,'' said
Stoichici, who declared his loyalty to the new government on
Saturday, before the outcome of the fighting was clear.
   Another embassy officer, Vasile Leca, said ``all the staff ...
fully support the National Salvation Committee. We condemn the
crimes that were done to the Romanian people by Nicolae and Elena
Ceausescu.''
   Stoichici and Leca refused to allow a reporter inside the
embassy, speaking instead through iron bars on a window in the
consular section.
   Splattered, frozen eggs coated the white brick walls of the
embassy, a turn-of-century mansion on Sheridan Circle along Embassy
Row.
   Wooden police barricades and yellow plastic tape stretched
alongside the sidewalk where scores of Romanians braved frigid
temperatures over Christmas weekend to vent their rage against a
symbol of Ceausescu's 24-year rule.
   The ambassador said his first order of business was to ``work to
improve relations with the United States,'' which had grown
increasingly critical of Ceausescu's human rights policies.
   ``Last evening, the State Department informed us that they
recognized the staff of the Romanian Embassy'' as the
representative of the new government, said the ambassador. He said
he was in telephone contact with State Department officials.
   A State Department official said no meetings were scheduled
between Stoichici and American diplomats, ``but we remain in
contact with them as much as we can.''
   ``They are in telephone contact with us, but when we call them,
they don't answer,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Press calls to the embassy were not answered, either.
   Romanian consular officials were also accepting, through the
barred window, visa applications from Romanian-Americans who wanted
to return home.
   ``I want to go back to help the people who are suffering. I
would like to offer blood, money, anything I can,'' said Ilie
Aurelian, a Romanian emigre artist who lives in Springfield, Va.
His wife is part of Romania's Hungarian minority and subject to
official persecution under Ceausescu. They emigrated from Romania
five years ago.
   Ioan Buburuzan, 38, a taxi driver and artist from Brooklyn,
N.Y., was also at the embassy seeking a visa to visit his father in
the village of Turdaa, in the Klug region of Romania. He emigrated
eight years ago.
   Buburuzan said his only regret is that Ceausescu and his wife
had been executed so quickly.
   ``I wish they had put him on trial. That would have given the
people a chance to see his crimes. And some of the evidence might
have been embarassing to people who are still in power now,'' said
Buburuzan.
   Aurelian disagreed, saying it was necessary to kill Ceausescu to
prevent security forces from rescuing him and restoring him to
power.
   ``So now the killing has stopped. That is good,'' said Aurelian.
   U.S. officials also regretted the secret trial.
   ``We would have preferred it if there had been a public trial,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Klan Launches Campaign to Rid Streets of Cocaine; Police, NAACP Wary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ku Klux Klan groups have kicked off a
campaign to rid Lakeland streets of crack cocaine dealers _ a move
that the NAACP and police view with suspicion.
   A ``Krush Krack Kocaine'' initiative calls on Klan members to
act as eyes and ears for police, gathering the goods on drug
dealers and forwarding the information to law-enforcement
authorities, group leaders say.
   ``We're not requesting that our people become vigilantes,'' said
Thom Robb, grand wizard of the national Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
in Harrison, Ark.
   But two recent incidents involving leaders of separate Klan
groups have caught the attention of police and the NAACP.
   George David Kirkland of Lakeland, the 44-year-old state kleagle
of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was questioned by police last
month after he tried to make a citizen's arrest of a uspected
prostitute and drove her to the police station.
   The woman, who was black, told police Kirkland identified
himself as a police officer and told her she was under arrest. The
woman did not want to press charges and police released Kirkland.
   On Dec. 13, undercover detectives stopped Donald Lloyd Spivey of
Kathleen, the 40-year-old grand dragon of the Florida Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, on suspicion of impersonating a police officer.
   Authorities decided not to accuse him of the third-degree felony
because he did not try to assert authority.
   The two Klan groups, which are not affiliated, are both focusing
on the north side of Lakeland, which is preodminantly black and
which city officials say is the area suffering most from drug and
violent crime problems.
   Spivey, in a recent interview, said his followers began citizen
patrols about eight months ago, splitting up in teams of five to
cruise crime-ridden areas.
   ``We have come into contact with several drug dealers and have
dealt with them accordingly. We talked to them and prayed with them
a little bit, and they moved to Tampa.''
   Kirkland said of drug dealers: ``We can get the addresses and
send them in and let the law take care of it.''
   ``We would look at the Klan as we would any informant,'' said
Police Chief Ron Nenner.
   But he warned that any law violations would be vigorously
pursued.
   Sheriff's Lt. Francis Hart declined to confirm whether the Klan
had offered its information-gathering services, saying it would be
unfair to all informants if he revealed their identities.
   ``I see no problem with them as long as they conduct themselves
appropriately. We don't promote anyone taking the law into their
own hands,'' he said.
   Don Brown, president of the Lakeland chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said his group
often offers tips to law enforcement authorities. He welcomed the
Klan's participation unless they are targeting certain ethnic grups.
   ``If the Klan is sincere in their endeavor and their efforts are
to expose the drug dealers whether black, white or Hispanic, I
commend them,'' he said. ``But if they are doing this to target
certain ethnic groups, I think it is appalling and they should be
punished without mercy and with passion.''
   In North Carolina, a Klan group tried to join the state's
``Adopt-A-Highway'' program, an anti-litter campaign which credits
volunteers who spruce up a section of highway by erecting a sign
bearing their names. In October, state Transportation Secretary Jim
Harrington denied the group's request.

<HEAD>Top Noriega Aide Pleads Innocent to Drug Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian officer considered one of Manuel
Noriega's ``right-hand men'' and accused of helping the deposed
dictator smuggle cocaine for the Medellin cartel pleaded innocent
before a federal judge Tuesday.
   ``I surrendered myself _ I wanted to be brought here,'' Lt. Col.
Luis del Cid told U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
   Del Cid, 46, faces racketeering, drug-smuggling and
money-laundering charges in the same February 1988 indictment that
accused Noriega and Medellin cartel figures of importing cocaine
into the United States.
   The commander of a Panama Defense Forces unit in the northern
Panama province of Chiriqui, del Cid surrendered to U.S. forces
Saturday after last week's invasion and was brought to Miami on
Monday. He is the first key Noriega aide named in the case to be
brought into court.
   Del Cid was ``a liason, courier and emissary for Manuel Noriega,
dealing with drug trafficking,'' U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen
said. ``We allege he personally imported shipments of cocaine, and
he personally transmitted large amounts of cash.''
   Lehtinen called del Cid ``one of the right-hand men of Gen.
Noriega.''
   Wearing faded jeans and a blue polo shirt, del Cid strongly
denied the four counts in court and demanded a jury trial.
   Hoeveler appointed a public defender as del Cid's temporary
counsel after the Panamanian testified he carried only $7,000 in
cash with him and had no access to a frozen savings account in
Panama.
   The judge turned back efforts by the U.S. attorney's office to
ask detailed questions of del Cid in an effort to uncover any
additional assets, saying such testimony could affect the
racketeering counts against him.
   Outside the courtroom, Lehtinen said federal investigators are
convinced the conspirators are sitting on large amounts of cash.
   ``They were dealing with large amounts of drugs _ that makes a
potential for a lot of profit,'' Lehtinen said. ``We've always
believed they made a lot of money.''
   One of Noriega's criminal attorneys, Frank Rubino, appeared at
the hearing. He said he did not expect to represent del Cid but
wanted to monitor the case.
   Lehtinen asked the judge to bar any consultations between del
Cid and Noriega's attorney, saying the defendant might not
understand that Rubino might not have del Cid's best interests in
mind, but Hoeveler refused.
   Asked if his real concern was that Noriega might try to pressure
his former aide, Lehtinen said only, ``I'd rather go with my
explanation.''
   The U.S. attorney referred any questions about Noriega to
officials in Washington. Lehtinen refused to say what contacts his
office had made with del Cid, or if he had indicated a willingness
to testify against Noriega.
   Del Cid faces a maximum of 70 years in prison and fines of
$550,000. He was ordered held without bond at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside Miami until a full hearing Jan. 2.
   The Miami indictment accuses Noriega, del Cid, cartel leader
Pablo Escobar Gaviria and 12 others of running drugs and using
Panama as a safe haven. Noriega, using del Cid as an emissary,
allegedly allowed the cartel to process drugs, launder money and
ship cocaine through Panama, accepting a $4.6 million bribe from
the Colombians.
   Del Cid is accused of having a personal role in a 400-kilogram
cocaine shipment to Florida in December 1982.
   He also allegedly picked up $100,000 from Noriega's personal
pilot, Floyd Carlton Cacerez, in November 1982, and delivered
$200,000 to Carlton at the military headquarters in Panama City a
month later. Carlton is one of the principal witnesses in the case.
   Two minor defendants, Brian Alden Davidow and William
Saldarriaga, were to go on trial here Jan. 8, but Lehtinen
indicated Tuesday he expects to ask for a delay in that case.
   It will not take long to begin any prosecution of del Cid,
however, the U.S. attorney said.
   ``We are confident that we have the evidence to convict him,''
Lehtinen said. ``We're ready to try him.''
   A separate federal grand jury in Tampa indicted Noriega and
others on charges of taking a $5.4 million bribe from the Medellin
cartel. But the Justice Department has said if Noriega is brought
to the United States, he would be tried first in Miami because the
prosecution case there is stronger.
   Del Cid was not named in the Tampa indictment.

<TEXT>
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard C. Breeden on Tuesday selected agency veteran William C.
McLucas as the SEC's new head of enforcement and announced creation
of a new fraud unit covering the sale of securities by financial
institutions.
   McLucas, 39, will succeed Gary Lynch, who resigned as SEC
director of enforcement in July after heading some of the agency's
biggest insider trading investigations.
   The enforcement job, which does not require Senate confirmation,
is considered the second most powerful position at the SEC and it
is Breeden's first major appointment since President Bush tapped
him as chairman last summer.
   McLucas, who has worked in the enforcement division for the past
12 years, had been considered one of the front-runners for the
post, but Breeden said he had considered three other SEC attorneys
and several persons from outside the agency before making the final
selection.
   Breeden said the SEC had decided to create a 25-attorney special
unit to investigate overly aggressive sales of securities by
savings and loans and other financial institutions.
   Such sales have been a major focus of congressional hearings
into the activities at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the
Irvine, Calif.-based S&amp;L whose failure is expected to be the
biggest in U.S. history, costing taxpayers as much as $2 billion.
   Lincoln Savings' parent company is American Continental Corp.,
headed by Arizona businessman Charles H. Keating Jr. When American
Continental filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws, it left
shareholders and investors holding nearly worthless stocks and
bonds.
   Included in this group were some 22,000 small investors who
purchased nearly $200 million in corporate bonds at Lincoln's 29
Southern California branches. About two-thirds of these investors
were elderly depositors. At congressionaly hearings, some of these
investors testified that they wrongly believed that the bonds they
were purchasing were federally insured.
   Breeden said that the new SEC unit would try to prevent other
financially troubled S&amp;Ls from turning to fradulent practices in a
desperate effort to raise cash.
   ``We intend to see to it that when people are sold securities,
they are provided all the necessary information,'' Breeden said.
   Lynch, who resigned to join a New York law firm, received
widespread praise for a series of big insider trading cases,
beginning with the exposure of stockbroker Dennis Levine. Lynch
also spearheaded cases that resulted in a $100 million settlement
with speculator Ivan Boesky and a record $650 million settlement of
a massive civil fraud cause with junk bond-giant Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   In May 1986, the SEC filed charges against Levine, whose
cooperation led to Boesky, who in turn implicated Drexel Burnham in
the largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government.
   Lynch took over the enforcement division in 1985 at a time of
turmoil after his predecessor, John Fedders, stepped down amid
allegations that he beat his wife.
   Lynch was credited with restoring morale at the agency. The
scandals in recent years have forced Wall Street's big brokerage
houses to re-evaluate their compliance and ethics codes and led
Congress to increase the penalties for insider trading.
   At the news conference, Breeden noted that Congress has boosted
the SEC budget by almost 20 percent this year to $168 million,
providing enough new money to hire an additional 100 lawyers.
   He said it was important for the SEC to police the securities
industry in such a way that individual investors will have renewed
confidence. Individual investors have left the market in droves in
recent years, partly out of fears raised by the huge gyrations in
stock prices that occurred in October of 1987 and 1989.
   During the 1970s, the SEC's enforcement division first gained
attention under Stanley Sporkin for pursuing corporations that
maintained political slush funds and paid bribes to win overseas
business.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch said Tuesday that his
biggest regret in 12 years at City Hall is that he did not get
credit for helping blacks.
   ``Many people in the black community do not perceive that I was
their friend,'' he said in his annual year-end meeting with
reporters, the last scheduled major press conference of his
mayoralty.
   Koch, who lost his re-election bid to David Dinkins, who is
black, claimed credit for appointing the city's first black police
commissioner, Benjamin Ward, and the first black deputy mayor for
economic development, Stanley Grayson.
   He said that under his administration, the percentage of civil
service jobs held by members of minority groups grew from 31
percent to 62 percent.
   He said he created Operation Giant Step, a program to put
4-year-olds in kindergarten, that he said was helpful largely to
black children.
   ``I believe this administration has been more helpful to the
black minority than all administrations before us,'' he said. ``I
don't think we got credit for it.''
   He discussed a remark that contributed to his political demise,
his statement during the 1988 presidential campaign that Jews
``would be crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jackson.
   That caused a black backlash that carried into this year's
mayoral primary, when Dinkins took 97 percent of the black vote.
   Koch maintained, however, that the black outpouring for Dinkins
was a matter of ethnic pride rather than an attack on him.
   He said the second half of his remark about Jackson went
unheeded. It was, ``... in the same way that blacks and supporters
of black causes would be crazy to vote for George Bush.''
   Asked how history would judge him in the light of dealing with
new problems such as the drug abuse, AIDS and homelessness, he
said, ``They know that within the confines of what a mayor can do,
that I did a lot.''
   After 25 years in city and federal government, Koch, 65, a
former congressman and City Councilman, will be embarking on a new
career as a newspaper columnist, radio and TV commentator, and
university and guest lecturer.

   Drinks are on the house at Pasta Too
restaurant. No, it's not the holiday spirit: The owners have been
giving them away for more than 4 years because they can't afford a
liquor license to sell alcohol.
   ``Hey, it's an extra little bennie (benefit) for the adults,''
said Jim Leddy, who recently frequented the restaurant in suburban
Bethel Park with his wife, Stephanie, and their daughter, Natalie.
   Pasta Too has been offering complimentary drinks to adults as
``a nice gesture'' for about 4{ years, owner Raymond Piacquadio
says.
   Piacquadio said his business is too small to pay the $40,000 or
more needed for a license to sell beer and wine. So for those who
want it, he gives it away _ plastic cups of Meisterbrau draft and
glasses of Gallo chablis and burgundy.
   It's perfectly legal, according to Steve Sandrovich, a
supervisor in the Pittsburgh office of the state police Bureau of
Liquor Control Enforcement. Nothing in the liquor code prohibits an
unlicensed establishment from giving away free beer, wine or liquor
to sober, orderly adults 21 and older.
   It is illegal, however, for a licensed business to give away
liquor.
   No purchase is necessary at restaurants giving away free drinks,
Sandrovich said.
   ``If you come in and say, `I just want the free beer,' they have
to give it to you,'' he said.

   A thousand or more revelers plan
to plunge into the New Year in this resort town's giant hot
spring-fed pool.
   The annual New Year's Eve splash has become a tradition in this
mountain town northwest of Aspen.
   ``At midnight, the pool is jammed,'' resident Nick Isenberg
said. ``At 12:05 a.m., it's empty.''
   The outdoor pool, billed as the world's largest, is actually two
pools just footsteps apart. One measures 400 feet by 100 feet and
the other 100 feet by 75 feet.
   The pool normally closes at 10 p.m., but remains open until 1
a.m. on New Year's morning, spokeswoman Lisa Wiggins said.For the
usual $5.25 admission fee, the staff provides party hats and
noisemakers.
   Those driving home from the bash may be relaxed, but they won't
be tipsy. No drinking is allowed at the pool, not even on New
Year's Eve.

<TEXT>
   _The head of the U.S. Southern Command discussed Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's fate with the Vatican ambassador. The United
States wants Noriega returned to the United States to stand trial
on drug charges.
   _Sources in Rome said the Vatican would rather hand Noriega over
to another country. But one country mentioned, Spain, has denied
him political asylum.
   _Many stores that had been looted bare reopened. Panamanians
returned to work.
   _U.S. military sources said they quelled scattered fighting from
Noriega loyalists and made arrests.
   _The Bush administration said it will seek to freeze assets
Noriega allegedly transferred out of Panama. Noriega hid more than
$10 million in drug money in a half-dozen countries, the Justice
Department said.
   _The U.S. military and the Panamanian government are arguing
over reconstituting the army _ the civilians want a weakened army,
U.S. officials a strong one.
   _Tons of medical supplies have arrived.
   _A high-ranking Panamanian officer accused of helping Noriega
smuggle cocaine was jailed in Florida after surrendering in Panama.
Lt. Col. Luis del Cid pleaded not guilty.
   _The Southern Command put American casualties at 23 dead and 330
wounded. The Panamanian Defense Forces were reported to have

   A drunken former soldier threw
a grenade on a dance floor at a holiday celebration, killing
himself and four other people and wounding 45, the Red Cross said
Tuesday.
   The man, identified as Julio Retana, had been denied entry to
the Christmas Eve party in Santa Ana, 40 miles northeast of San
Salvador, because of his drunken condition, said a Red Cross
volunteer.
   The volunteer spoke to The Associated Press by telephone on

<TEXT>
   An autopsy on former New York Yankee
manager Billy Martin was canceled Tuesday at his family's request,
and a prosecutor said that could make it harder to charge the
driver of the truck in which Martin died.
   The Broome County sheriff's department reported slow progress in
investigating the Christmas night accident that killed Martin, 61,
and injured a longtime friend, William Reedy of Detroit, who was at
the wheel of Martin's pickup.
   Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said it would be another day or two before
the alcohol level in Reedy's blood was confirmed through laboratory
tests.
   Reedy was charged Christmas night with a misdemeanor charge of
driving-while-intoxicated and faces a fine of up to $1,000 and a
year in jail.
   Authorities said the pickup skidded off an icy road Monday
evening in front of Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, 150
miles northwest of New York City. Neither man was wearing a seat
belt, authorities said.
   Ruffo said the accident happened at a hairpin curve that has a
history of accidents.
   Icy, slippery roads and Reedy's unfamiliarity with the area were
believed to be factors in the accident, Ruffo said. He said the
speed limit on the road was 55 mph, but did not know how fast the
truck had been going.
   Mechanical failure of Martin's four-wheel-drive pickup was ruled
out, the sheriff said. ``The truck checked out fine,'' he said.
   An autopsy scheduled Tuesday was canceled at the request of
family members, said Michael Doll, spokesman for Wilson Memorial
Hospital in Johnson City.
   Broome County District Attorney Gerald Mollen said he hoped to
persuade County Coroner Patrick Ruddy to conduct an autopsy in
spite of the family's wishes in order to pinpoint the exact cause
of Martin's death.
   But Ruddy said an autopsy would reveal little that an external
examination did not.
   ``He died, basically, of a fractured neck,'' Ruddy said. ``The
chest X-ray was reasonably intact, belly was normal, blood count
was normal. It's all in the neck area.''
   Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium,
suffered a broken hip and possible broken ribs in the accident. He
was listed in fair condition Tuesday at the Upstate Medical Center
Hospital in Syracuse.
   Reedy said he and Martin had gone to a store and then stopped
for a quick drink at a Binghamton bar, said Deputy Steve Glanville.
   Mollen said it would be ``days, at least'' before he decides
whether to charge Reedy with anything more serious than driving
while intoxicated, such as manslaughter.
   The lack of an autopsy would not preclude further charges,
Mollen said.
   Martin purchased the farm in September 1988, three months after
he was fired by Yankee owner George Steinbrenner for the final
time. He said he was attracted to the area for its fishing and
quiet surroundings.
   The feisty Martin made a good name for himself by narrating the
Binghamton Symphony Orchestra's production of ``Billy the Kid'' and
speaking at a local girls' softball league dinner, but he and his
wife, Jill, were also in the news for confronting a group of
children riding horses.
   Mrs. Martin and an unidentified man with a gun chased the youths
off the land, saying they were destroying property and setting
fires, and Martin confronted the manager of the stable that
organized the ride. The stable said it had negotiated an easement
with the previous owner of the land.
   The Internal Revenue Service last summer placed a $35,562 tax
lien on the property, reportedly to cover an alleged underpayment
on Martin's 1987 income tax return. Laurie Ruffino, an IRS
spokesman in Buffalo, said the lien had been paid recently.
   In addition to Martin's wife, survivors include one son and one
daughter, both from previous marriages.
   Funeral services were not immediately announced.

   The Bush administration, still struggling to
get custody of deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, said
Tuesday it wants to freeze millions of dollars in assets he
allegedly transferred out of Panama.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said U.S. officials
will file papers Wednesday in more than a half-dozen countries
where, he said, Noriega had hidden ``illegal drug money'' amounting
to more than $10 million.
   Runkel said the U.S. would try to freeze cash, or liquid assets,
which are in European bank accounts. He refused to identify the
banks, although he did say that none of Noriega's money has been
traced to the United States.
   The administration was training its legal sights on Panamanian
money assets as officials remained embroiled in tense negotiations
over Noriega, wanted in this country on drug-trafficking charges.
The administration sought to pry Noriega from the custody of the
the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   In Panama City, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern
Command, conferred three time on the street outside the embassy
with Monsignor Sabastian Laboa, the papal nuncio.
   Despite the negotiations, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the
situation with Noriega might be prolonged for an indefinite period
of time. ``It could be that they'll have a long-term resident in
their embassy in Panama City,'' he said.
   The Vatican, which has no extradition treaty with the United
States, refused to simply hand Noriega over to Washington. And it
has maintained that stand since the deposed Panamanian leader,
along with what Runkel described as ``10 associate thugs,'' sought
asylum at Papal Nunciature Sunday afternoon.
   ``Our position is, we mean to bring him back to the United
States,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. But he
refused to rule out the possibility that other options might be
considered. One scenario is that Noriega might stand trial in
Panama. Another had him possibly going to a third country.
   ``Everybody is talking to everybody,'' Fitzwater said. But he
said ``it's too soon to characterize it as progress.''
   Although Bush has not talked directly either with Pope John Paul
II or with the nunciature in Panama about Noriega, Fitzwater said
U.S. officials have used diplomatic channels to press their demand.
   ``We told them very directly what our feeling were,'' he said.
   Fitzwater spoke at the White House as President Bush was having
a working lunch with top advisers at his Camp David, Md., and as
the chief Pentagon spokesman said conditions had stabilized in
Panama.
   Bush was briefed by Cheney, newly returned from a visit to U.S.
troops in Panama, along with national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Gen. Colin D. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams revealed that when
Noriega turned himself in Sunday, he was ``said to be so exhausted
from the chase that he could barely speak.'' Williams said Noriega
had been on the run since the U.S. operations began six days
earlier, and said he never was in command of the Panamanian Defense
Forces which resisted U.S. soldiers.
   A task force composed of officials from the departments of
State, Justice and Defense, as well as National Security Council,
was formed to tackle the negotiations on Noriega's fate. The group
conducted most of its meetings in telephone conferences.
   The United States has rejected the idea that Noriega might be
entitled to political asylum. Under international law, such asylum
can only be granted on the grounds that a person is subject to
persecution because of religious or political views, Runkel said.
   ``Noriega does not fit either category,'' he said. ``His fears
are of prosecution in the United States on two indictments.''
   Fitzwater said the United States had offered Noriega a deal as
recently as October if he would step down, but Noriega refused. The
United States will not compromise with Noriega now, he said.
   Meantime, one U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the pope's representatives have contacted several
Latin American and European countries in hopes one will agree to
take Noriega.
   ``He has no place to go yet,'' the official said. ``No one wants
him.''
   Officials said there was no way Noriega could flee from the
nunciature because it is surrounded by U.S. troops intending to
remain in place as long as Noriega is inside.
   ``There's no way he can get out,'' Cheney said in an interview
on ABC-TV. ``But by the same token, we do not have the authority to
go in and take him out because of international law.''
   Cheney, back from a Christmas Day tour of Panama where visited
an estimated 26,000 troops, said the situation in the country was
``much quieter than it's been'' since the U.S. invasion last week.
   Despite occasional sniping incidents, Cheney said the
``overwhelming sense is a return to normalcy.'' Cheney said the
``U.S. military did its job,'' and now ``the lawyers and the
diplomats have to take over.''
   If the situation in Panama continues to improve, Cheney said,
the United States might speed up the withdrawal of troops. He gave
no timetable, though.
   Williams said Panamanian citizens have been turning weapons over
to U.S. troops and revealing the whereabouts of large weapons
caches.
   ``The best I can tell you is that about 33,000 weapons have now
been captured, discovered, or turned in,'' he said.

   An Israeli officer fatally shot a Palestinian
protester in the West Bank on Tuesday, and an Israeli-owned bus was
reported set ablaze by masked Arab assailants in Israel as
passengers fled the vehicle.
   A group of army officers' wives demanded on Tuesday that Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin either resign or accept responsibility for
orders they claimed he issued to soldiers in the occupied
territories.
   On Monday, the army announced plans to court martial Israeli
Col. Yehuda Meir, accused of ordering troops to beat and break the
legs of 20 bound and gagged Palestinian detainees in January 1988.
   Meir's wife, Orna, and other officers' wives claimed Rabin gave
the orders to brutalize the Palestinians.
   Tuesday's violence came a day after a PLO leaflet urged
Palestinians to escalate attacks on Israeli forces between
Christmas and the New Year ``to honor the Palestinian revolution.''
   At least 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the two-year uprising against the occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   At least 161 other Arabs have been slain by fellow Palestinians
as accused collaborators with Israel. Forty-three Israelis also
have died.
   The latest fatality, Farraj Daher Abu Fekhaida, 26, was shot in
the chest when an Israeli commander fired on stone-throwers during
an army raid on the village of Jina near Ramallah, the army and
Arab reports said.
   The Israeli-owned bus was set on fire within Israeli territory
near the West Bank town of Jenin, Israeli radio reports said.
   One masked assailant held a hatchet to the driver, while two
others spilled kerosene on the floor and then set the vehicle on
fire, the reports said. The passengers, Palestinians going to jobs
in Israel, reportedly managed to flee unhurt.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded three Palestinian
teen-agers in clashes in the Jebaliya and Shati refugee camps, Arab
reports said.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli state prosecutor Dorit Beinisch ordered
further investigation into the death of a 27-year-old Palestinian
who died last week in custody of the Shin Bet security agency in
the Gaza Strip, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.
   The prisoner, Khalid Kamel Sheikh Ali, had been detained three
weeks earlier on suspicion of concealing weapons for a Moslem
fundamentalist group.
   Michael Baden, director of Forensic Sciences for New York State
Police, who was commissioned by the victim's family to conduct an
autopsy, told reporters Monday Ali died from a blow to the abdomen
dealt with ``a large amount of force.''
   The charges against Meir say soldiers under his command left
beaten and bound Palestinians from Beita and Hawara villages in a
field until other Arabs came and took them to a hospital.
   Meir served as military commander of Nablus, the largest town in
the West Bank, and becomes the highest-ranking officer to face
trial during the uprising. He resigned from the army under pressure
in April 1988.
   Orna Meir, who formed the wives' group on Tuesday, said on
Israel radio that Rabin was responsible for the beating orders.

   Searchers on Tuesday found the body of a
second victim of a Christmas Eve explosion at Exxon's giant
refinery here that damaged buildings six miles away.
   Property owners, meanwhile, flooded the plant's office with
calls about damage caused by the storage tank blast.
   Elsewhere, heating oil futures prices surged on speculation that
the damage to the nation's second-largest refinery, combined with a
recent record-setting cold wave, would tighten home fuel supplies.
Heating oil for January delivery jumped 10.74 cents to 92.48 cents
a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Officials said they were trying to determine whether the second
body was that of an Exxon worker missing since the blast.
   The missing worker's name has not been made public. Some workers
reported seeing him Sunday after the explosion, but he has not been
seen since.
   ``The family of the missing employee has been notified and is
being updated on the status of the identification effort,'' Exxon
spokesman Dave Gardner said.
   Previously, the company said mechanic Harold Guillory, 31, of
Erwinville, an employee of a contractor, died when his pickup truck
caught fire near the explosion.
   Exxon spokesman Jim Davis said the company didn't anticipate any
immediate effect from the blast on its ability to supply heating
oil. Davis said there was some flexibility in the Exxon refinery
network, which includes refineries in Baytown, Texas, and Linden,
N.J.
   Asked about long-term supplies, company spokesman Walter
Eldredge said, ``We think we will be able to meet all our
commitments.''
   Investigators from Exxon were still working to determine the
cause of the explosion.
   More than 1,000 Baton Rouge area residents have called Exxon
with complaints that their houses were damaged by the explosion.
   Eldredge said Exxon officials will begin Wednesday to inspect
the claimed damages.
   The Christmas Eve fire engulfed two large storage tanks, holding
a combined 3.6 million gallons of heating oil, and three smaller
tanks with about 882,000 gallons of lubricating oil, officials said.
   The refinery has a capacity of 455,000 barrels _ more than 19
million gallons _ of crude oil a day.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the
Environmental Protection Agency were investigating the accident.

   U.S. drug agents have been poring
over thousands of seized documents that are providing valuable
intelligence on international drug trafficking, authorities said
Tuesday.
   They said the information could be used against Panamanians
under U.S. drug indictments, such as Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
and his associate, Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, who has been arrested and
taken to the United States.
   One windfall was the headquarters of Panama's Anti-Narcotics
Special Force.
   U.S. soldiers stormed the headquarters Monday and detained three
men after being tipped off by an informant, said U.S. Army Lt. Col.
William Leszczynski, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry
Regiment.
   Authorities reported finding rifles, shotguns, handguns and much
ammunition as well as cocaine, marijuana, morphine and drug
paraphernalia.
   Torture apparently was carried out in the same building.
Leszczynski said his troops found ``electronic devices that could
be hooked up to people for electric shocks.''
   They found a room filled with immigration files of foreigners
from more than two dozen countries, including Cuba, Nicaragua and
Colombia. The files, in racks that reached the ceiling, contained
detailed information on foreigners' entries and exits. Each file
had a small photo of the subject.
   One Miami-based agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration who visited the white stucco house Tuesday said that
at first glance, it seemed to be a legitimate anti-narcotics
operation.
   ``What I find unusual is that these files were kept in a
house,'' she said. ``I need to find out whose house this is, in
whose name it's registered.'' She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The files largely were from the 1960s through the 70s.
   ``It's good for us,'' the agent said. ``This tells me who's been
in an out of the country. I already found some files of Colombian
drug traffickers. So now I know they were here. Now I go for the
more recent files.''
   She would not say how many DEA agents came here, although she
said it was far fewer than 20. The U.S. military has provided
transport, communications and other support, she added.
   Three makeshift jails at the back of the house seemed to have
been inhabited recently. A plastic container with urine stood in
the corner of one cell, where the occupant had slept on a dirty mat
and cardboard placed on the cement floor.

<TEXT>
   More than 150 members of an outlawed
Tamil militia surrendered to the Sri Lankan army Tuesday after
trekking through the jungle for three days to escape rival Tamil
guerrillas.
   The weary members of the outlawed Tamil National Army contacted
the Sri Lankan army Monday in northeastern Nidamwela town and were
brought to a makeshift detention center 30 miles away, military
officials said.
   They surrendered a few hours after guerrillas of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacked a Tamil National Army camp, killing
44 militants in the Batticaloa district, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   The Tigers, the strongest guerrilla group in Sri Lanka's Tamil
ethnic minority, have intensified their power struggle with rival
Tamil militants as Indian peacekeeping troops wind down their
2{-year effort to pacify the northeastern part of the island.
   The Tigers and the Sri Lankan government claim the departing
Indians have armed and trained 4,000 members of the Tamil National
Army. India has repeatedly insisted it only trained a volunteer
force sanctioned by the Sri Lankan government _ and not the Tamil
National Army, which has been outlawed by President Ranasinghe
Premadasa's government.
   Indian troops started arriving in Sri Lanka July 30, 1987, under
an accord with India in an effort to settle the insurrection. But
the Tigers reneged on the accord and attacked the Indians, who were
supposed to oversee a surrender of arms.
   India agreed in September to withdraw its last troops by Dec. 31
but later said it was unlikely to meet that deadline. An estimated
25,000 Indian soldiers remain.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million
people, claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese, and Tamil
militants want a separate homeland. The revolt has claimed 11,000
lives since it started in 1983.
   The 155 militants had slipped out of the camp Friday in search
of food but had been spotted and pursued by the Tamil Tigers, one
of the militants told reporters who were flown to Polonnarywa, 100
miles northeast of Colombo.
   ``We do not want to go back, we will be killed,'' said a young
Tamil in the abandoned warehouse housing the militants.
   The military officials said the guerrillas, most aged 18 to 24,
were being held in protective custody in the barbed wire-fenced
warehouse. He said the militants would be flown to Colombo soon.
   The officials displayed an array of weapons they said had been
seized from the militants. Officials in Colombo said the arms
included 83 Soviet-designed AK47 assault rifles, a light machine
gun, four submachine guns, five mortars, two rocket launchers, five
hand grenades and a cache of ammunition.
   On Monday, soldiers killed seven Sinhalese militants in separate
battles in north central Anuradhapura and central Kandy districts,
a government statement said.

   Petre Roman, Romania's interim prime
minister, is a young intellectual who faces the daunting task of
finding ways to mend a country torn by bloody strife and a battered
economy.
   ``It's clear that our difficulties are great,'' Roman told
Soviet television in an interview Tuesday.``The greater part of the
cadres we need for our economy have not yet resumed their work.''
   The 43-year-old university professor said he and the rest of the
37 members of the National Salvation Committee, Romania's main
organ of power since the Dec. 22 toppling of dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, have not had time to examine what exactly to do about
the economy.
   ``What we have achieved so far is to solve only emergency
problems,'' Roman told the Vremya news program. ``The questions
I'll be dealing with are connected with restoration of the economy
under new conditions.''
   Romania was badly mishandled during Ceausescu's rule, leading to
widespread shortages of basic foodstuffs, commodities and energy.
   Ceausescu, who rejected the kind of reforms under way elsewhere
in the Soviet bloc, advocated a Stalinist-type centrally planned
economy, entirely disregarding market forces and outlawing private
property.
   In another interview Tuesday with French television, Roman said
the reason for executing Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, only two
days after their capture was that the Council feared Ceausescu's
secret police were planning a rescue attempt.
   Roman graduated from the Faculty of Hydromechanics of the
Polytechnic Institute in Bucharest, where he now is a professor.
   He did post-graduate work at the National Polytechnic Institute
in Toulouse, France, where he graduated magna cum laude.
   He is married and the father of two children.
   Roman's late father Valter was a prominent sociologist who
fought in Spain against anti-Franco forces during the Spanish Civil
War. His mother, Hortensia, now retired, for years had a high-level
post at the state-run Radio Bucharest.

<HEAD>Snow Squalls From New Cold Wave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A new mass of cold air moved across the lower Great Lakes on
Tuesday with snow, wind and dropping temperatures.
   The surge of cold air and wind was expected to produce wind
chill effects of from 20 below to 35 below zero during the night
over central New England.
   Snow fell across northern New England, over much of inland New
York state, northeastern and western Pennsylvania, northeastern
Ohio, eastern West Virginia, western Virginia, northwestern North
Carolina, northern Indiana, lower Michigan, northeastern Wisconsin,
eastern North Dakota, western and south-central Minnesota, and
north-central Iowa.
   The heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to noon was 4
inches at Watertown, N.Y.
   For the first time in more than a week, the National Weather
Service did not report any record low temperatures. And the
temperature reached 33 degrees at the New Castle County Airport
near Wilmington, Del., the first time the temperature there had
been above freezing since the evening of Dec. 15.
   There was dense fog in some valleys of the West early Tuesday.
   Heavy fog over Puget Sound delayed takeoffs and landings at
Sea-Tac Airport, which serves Seattle and Tacoma. Airport officials
could not say immediately how many flights were diverted.
   Heavy fog at Salt Lake City had flights running about 2{ hours
behind schedule during the night, with some incoming flights
diverted to Idaho Falls, Idaho, and Las Vegas, Nev.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 21 degrees below zero
at International Falls, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees below zero at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 76 at Bergstrom
Air Force Base at Austin, Texas.

   Cuba on Tuesday requested an urgent
meeting of the U.N. Security Council to condemn Washington for
ordering troops to circle the Cuban Embassy in Panama during the
hunt for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   No meeting was scheduled during informal council consultations
Tuesday night, but the question could be considered again.
   Cuban Ambassador Oscar Oramas Oliva made the request in his
second letter in two days to Security Council President Enrique
Penalosa of Colombia. He said that people in the Cuban ambassador's
residence in Panama City and in the embassy were virtual prisoners.
   At least 25 children and 30 women were being prevented from
leaving, he said, calling the U.S. action a violation of
international law and infringement upon the rights of diplomatic
personnel.
   U.S. troops surrounded the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in
Panama City on Thursday after rumors surfaced that Noriega may be
hiding in one of the missions. Noriega turned himself in Sunday to
the Vatican mission in Panama City.
   Last week, the council met at the request of Nicaragua, which
sought to condemn the U.S. invasion of Panama. But the United
States, Britain and France on Saturday vetoed a resolution that
would have deplored the U.S. military action and demanded immediate
withdrawal of U.S. forces.

<TEXT>
   A numbing Christmas freeze caused
widespread damage to Florida crops, but citrus growers were
optimistic Tuesday that trees suffered little damage and much of
the iced fruit can be turned into juice.
   Florida's third major killer freeze in six years was not
believed as disastrous to citrus as those in December 1983 and
January 1985.
   But near-total losses were reported in winter vegetables _ much
of it destined for Northeastern markets _ in large areas of the
state.
   Agriculture officials said it was too early to estimate the
financial losses. In some cases, the full extent of damage will not
be known for weeks or months.
   Elsewhere, Texas officials estimate 70 percent of that state's
citrus crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were
destroyed by the cold weather.
   Sleet, snow, rain and wind combined with temperatures ranging
from the teens to the high 20s throughout the Florida peninsula
during the weekend. The cold contributed to at least seven deaths
and caused burst water pipes and other problems for residents used
to sub-tropical December weather.
   The multibillion-dollar citrus industry was still recovering
from the earlier freezes that wiped out some 250,000 acres of trees.
   But many growers believed the major damage this time was
confined to the fruit.
   ``I don't think it was a tree-killing freeze,'' said Dan Gunter,
executive director of the Florida Department of Citrus.
   More than 80 percent of the citrus crop was still on the trees
when the cold arrived, and few groves escaped damage in the
700,000-acre citrus belt.
   Vegetables, strawberries, ornamental plants and other crops were
also hard hit.
   Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner said there were
heavy losses of beans, squash, corn, tomatoes and watermelons. He
said he hoped enough citrus and vegetables could be salvaged to
maintain market supplies.
   ``With shortages, naturally prices will go up. I just hope that
we have enough fruit to keep a rather stable market because
everyone prefers to have product in the marketplace rather than
heavy limitations on supply and unreasonable prices,'' the
commissioner said.
   Central Florida growers said thousands of acres of carrots,
radishes, cauliflower and broccoli were destroyed and little would
be salvageable.
   The $1 billion foliage industry, one of the state's
fastest-growing agriculture commodities, suffered a minimum of 20
percent losses statewide, said Earl Wells, executive vice president
of the Florida Nurserymen and Growers Association.
   Almost 90 percent of the Florida orange crop goes into juice.
Gunter said the citrus industry had large stocks of juice
concentrate. That stock and the larger-than-normal Brazilian citrus
crop should stabilize juice prices somewhat, he said.
   ``Because of that, there might be a more moderate impact than we
might expect for a freeze year,'' Gunter said.
   Nevertheless, commodities traders sharply bid up the price of
orange juice futures Tuesday, speculating that the freeze would
cause a scramble for supplies. The January contract for frozen
concentrated orange juice rose 16.1 cents to $1.531 a pound on the
New York Cotton Exchange.
   Harvesting crews were out in force in bright, sunny weather
Tuesday. Citrus growers rushed to pick early and midseason oranges
and grapefruit and get them to processing plants to be turned into
juice before spoilage.
   Ironically, growers now hope the cool weather will stick around
for a week or so during the citrus harvesting and round-the-clock
processing. Temperatures forecast in the 60s and 70s later in the
week would hasten juice loss in the damaged fruit.
   Rapidly rising temperatures in Texas blocked efforts to salvage
frozen fruit for juice. Growers said they were dealt the fatal blow
Monday when temperatures shot into the mid-50s, reducing the frozen
fruit to mush.
   ``It appears to me even the canneries wouldn't accept it because
the fruit has been frozen so bad,'' said Joe Kutzenberger,
president of KY Farms in Harlingen, Texas. ``It's turning soft and
even bleeding through the skin of the fruit. I would say it's a
total loss.''
   Losses to Texas citrus industry are estimated at $200 million so
far and could top $500 million as trees begin to show effects from
the freeze, said David Galvan of the Texas Department of
Agriculture.
   The Florida Citrus Commission said Tuesday it would not invoke
emergency rules limiting shipments of fresh fruit that suffered
icing. Commission Chairman Bill Becker said the industry was
relying on the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Inspection Service,
affiliated with U.S. Department of Agriculture, to ensure the
quality of fresh-fruit shipments.

   A Michigan ski area shut down Tuesday
after a 6-year-old boy apparently was strangled in a ski-lift
mechanism.
   Anthony Ryan Mazzali of La Porte, Texas, visiting relatives with
his parents, died Saturday at Munising's city-owned Maple Mountain
Ski Hill on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, police Chief Douglas Miron
said Tuesday.
   Don Fahrbach, the Alger County medical examiner who handled
boy's autopsy, said Anthony apparently died of strangulation after
his clothing became caught in the lift machinery. Fahrbach said
tests to confirm the cause of death were due back later this week.
   Miron said it was the first time anyone had been killed or
seriously injured at the ski hill. The resort, which is privately
managed for the city, had been closed for Christmas and remained
closed Tuesday, officials said.

<HEAD>China Blocking Meeting on Romania to Prevent Comparisons, Diplomats
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is blocking Security Council debate
on the revolt in Romania because it fears comparisons with
Beijing's own violent encounter with pro-democracy protests,
diplomats said Tuesday.
   The Security Council put off discussion on Romania on Tuesday
because of resistance by China, the diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A U.N. spokesman said only that the Romanian question, which had
been placed on the agenda, had not been taken up. There was no
comment from Chinese diplomats.
   Weeks of pro-democracy protests in China earlier this year were
crushed by troops in Beijing. China says about 300 people died, 200
of them civilians. Witnesses and Western security sources say the
toll may range from 500 to 3,000.
   In Romania, the new revolutionary government says more than
12,000 people were believed slain during a week of protests against
the rule of ousted leader Nicolae Ceausescu, who ordered troops to
shoot demonstrators. Mass graves were found in the western city of
Timisoara.
   U.N. diplomats said China government wants to avoid any
comparison with Romania. China has reacted sharply to international
criticism to its crackdown.
   U.N. diplomats familiar with council proceedings said China,
with the support of some developing nations, argued that the
situation in Romania was strictly an internal affair and the
international community should not become involved.
   Other diplomats argued, however, that the instability in Romania
threatens Europe, and that maintaining international peace and
stability is a legitimate concern of the 15-nation Security Council.
   Austria, Hungary, West Germany and Italy last week requested
that the issue a statement about the crisis in Romania. They
suggested the council could deplore the violence among the
demonstrators, army and security forces and call for an orderly
transition to democracy.
   China, however, refused Saturday to permit Security Council
President Enrique Penalosa of Colombia to read an informal
statement of concern to reporters.
   China is one of the five permanent council members with veto
power and can block a statement. A council statement requires a
concensus. The five permanent members are the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union.

   Here is a summary of events Tuesday in Romania:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Romanian television shows tape of deposed leader Nicolae
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, after they were executed by firing
squad for crimes against Romania. They lay crumpled on the ground
in front of a bullet-riddled wall. Earlier, television showed
footage of the couple at what is believed to have been their secret
trial.
   _ Romanians cheer the executions and Romanian sources say the
security forces loyal to Ceausescu are beginning to surrender en
masse.
   _ The new revolutionary government says Ceausescu and his
security forces killed 60,000 people during his 24-year rule.
Television shows what is described as a torture chamber in
Timisoara.
   _The revolutionary council names its informal leader, Ion
Iliescu, a former official ousted by Ceausescu, as chairman of the
governing council. It also names Petre Roman, a 43-year-old
professor of hydraulic engineeering with no political background,
as prime minister.
   _ The provisional leadership repeals travel restrictions and
other hated Ceausescu laws, lifting the dictator's orders to
destroy thousands of rural villages and move the residents into the
cities. It revokes family planning restrictions, rules on talking
to foreigners and allows Romanians unrestricted ownership of such
once-regulated items as typewriters.
   _ The Interior Ministry loses control of the security forces,
which are put under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry, which
controls the army. It was the army that sided with pro-democracy
protesters when revolution broke out, and security forces who
remained loyal to Ceausescu.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Committee of the ruling
Communist Party recommended Tuesday that the party adopt a proposal
to end its 45-year monopoly on power in Yugoslavia.
   The party will consider the proposal at its January congress in
Belgrade.
   The Yugoslav Communist Party was the first to break with the
monolithic communist bloc in 1948. But Yugoslavia has been slower
to adopt many of the democratic reforms now sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Secretary Stefan Korosec told the 165-member Central Committee
the party is ready for competition of ``equal political partners.''
   Korosec said the party will embark on reforms ``not to reject
the idea of socialism, but to preserve and develop it further.''
   The draft is a ``result of ambition to prove that we ... do not
find ourselves at the tail of reforms in socialism,'' he said.
   Other political parties have already been allowed in Slovenia
and Croatia, two of the six republics in the Yugoslav federation.
Serbia, the largest republic, decided this month to allow other
parties with some restrictions.
   Yugoslavia has a population of 23.5 million.

<HEAD>Jews at Western Wall Celebrate Hanukkah with World via Satellite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several thousand people at Jerusalem's Western
Wall celebrated Hanukkah Tuesday via satellite with Jews in New
York, Moscow, London and Paris.
   The mostly ultra-Orthodox crowd watched quietly as prayers were
chanted and the fifth candle was lighted in all five cities in the
first high-tech global Hannukah ceremony.
   Hannukah, the eight-day festival of lights, celebrates the
victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syrian kingdom in 165 B.C. The
kingdom tried to impose its culture on the Jews and desecrated the
holy temple in Jerusalem with statues of Greek gods.
   According to legend, when the Jews entered Jerusalem and tried
to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found enough oil for
one day, but the oil miraculously lasted eight days.
   To commemorate the miracle, Jews light candles at sunset for
eight consecutive days.
   The Western Wall, where the candle-lighting ceremony was held,
is the sole remnant of the second Jewish temple and the holiest
site in Judaism.
   Ruth Kabakoff, a 60-year-old tourist from Orlando, Fla., watched
one of two screens facing the Western Wall with excitement. She
said she heard about the satellite ceremony in her hotel, from
announcements in the streets over loudspeakers.
   ``I think it is wonderful that Jews feel that strongly about
their faith to join together. It makes me want to cry,'' she said.
   The candle in Jerusalem was lighted by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi
Mordehai Eliahu, one of Israel's two chief rabbis.
   The Jerusalem crowd listened to a speech in Yiddish from
Brooklyn, N.Y., by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem M. Schneerson.
The rabbi's Habad movement sponsored the satellite ceremony.
   Esther Bodzin, an 18-year-old seminary student from Detroit,
said the highlight for her was watching children in Moscow
celebrate Hannukah.
   ``I think it's amazing. Look at all the people here. This one TV
show is tying together the Jews from all over,'' she said.

<DATELINE>CORNING, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the National Farmers
Organization urged President Bush and congressional leaders Tuesday
to work with farmers to increase agricultural exports to Eastern
Europe.
   ``Food will assist Eastern bloc nations more than dollars and,
at the same time, help the U.S. agricultural economy,'' said DeVon
Woodland of Blackfoot, Idaho, a rancher and president of the
Iowa-based NFO.
   Woodland said studies indicate that countries that received
assistance under the U.S. Food for Peace program have become
friends of the United States and developed into trading partners.
The same cannot be said of countries receiving U.S. financial aid,
he said.
   ``Why dollar aid when people in the Eastern bloc countries have
no food available to buy? We are the richest and most abundant
agriculture country in the world. We should use this food to, or at
least a portion of it, for assistance to the hungry,'' Woodland
said in a statement released by NFO headquarters in Corning.
   The group represents more than 250,000 farm families and markets
farm commodities for its members.
   Woodland said food shipments to Eastern Europe would reduce
grain surpluses, and thereby push up the prices U.S. farmers
receive for their crops.
   He urged President Bush, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
and members of the House and Senate agriculture committees to
consider establishing a federal agriculture conference to help
increase exports of food to Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Round-Table Talks Next Week; General Strike Called Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist Politburo on Tuesday
proposed round-table talks on the country's future with other
official and newly active opposition groups.
   The action came after an independent trade union, Podkrepa,
proposed warning strikes for Wednesday, presumably in selected
places, and a general strike Thursday to push demands for the talks.
   It was not clear whether the Politburo offer was in response to
Podkrepa's threat of the first general strike in Bulgaria since the
Communist takeover after World War II.
   It also was not clear whether the strikes would go ahead as
planned. Podkrepa is one of several opposition groups that have
been allowed to function publicly since Todor Zhivkov was ousted as
Communist leader Nov. 10.
   An initial meeting took place Dec. 15 between the ruling
Communists and representatives of opposition groups.
   Zhivkov's ouster came amid a wave of change that swept the East
bloc, beginning with Poland and Hungary and spreading to East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania.
   Petar Mladenov, who took over from Zhivkov, has pledged to scrap
the Communist Party's monopoly on power, remove its guaranteed
leading role from the Constitution and hold free elections by May.
   Also Tuesday, reform Communists demanded the resignation of the
entire existing party Central Committee, elected under Zhivkov, and
announced plans to split from the party and form a faction known as
the Alternative Socialist Association.
   The group will hold a meeting Jan. 12, the state news agency BTA
reported.
   The group also wants the party to share with emerging
alternative parties the extensive property amassed over the last
four decades, its funds and printing presses, BTA said.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
probably went by himself to the Vatican Embassy and decided to seek
asylum after his aides abandoned him or were arrested, the U.S.
Southern Command said Tuesday.
   It said Noriega was never in charge of his Defense Forces after
the U.S. invasion on Dec. 20 and did not contact any of its members
for fear of a trap. During the fighting, military spokesmen had
said the resistance was centrally directed and Noriega was involved.
   In a brief communique released to reporters, Southern Command
gave an account of Noriega's time after the invasion based on what
it said were interviews with his cronies.
   Noriega at one point considered ``fleeing to the mountains to
mount an insurgent attack, but he was concerned about his heart
while living in difficult terrain without the opulent luxuries and
intensive medical care'' to which he had become accustomed,
according to the communique.
   It quoted aides who were interviewed as saying Noriega wore red
underwear to ward off the ``evil eye.''
   The communique said that before the invasion, Noriega had
dismissed the possibility of an attack by U.S. troops and was in
Colon, 50 miles north of Panama City, inspecting a new military
facility.
   ``He was aware of increased U.S. force activities but discounted
the notion of an attack, passing the increased activity off as more
U.S. posturing,'' the communique said.
   It said that about 6 p.m. on Dec. 19, he was dropped off at a
Panamanian Defense Forces club in Tocumen near the Omar Torrijos
airport.
   ``There he was provided a prostitute by one of his aides _
apparently a routine occurrence,'' it said.
   When Tocumen was attacked about 1 a.m., Noriega left the club
and evaded U.S. forces by driving around Panama City, according to
the communique.
   Southern Command said Noriega's first telephone call after the
invasion was to his mistress, Vicky Amado, and that he never tried
to contact his wife, Felicidad.
   It said Noriega was ``agitated'' and spent the days at various
locations, mostly at the home of relatives of his private
secretary, Marcella Tason.
   His supporters tried to make him leave town but he refused, it
said.
   It added that at one point, Noriega was believed to have
contacted the Cuban ambassador and considered going to Cuba's
embassy but backed off because the compound was surrounded by U.S.
troops.
   The Bush administration had set a $1 million bounty for Noriega.
   Southern Command said Noriega decided to go ``single-handed'' to
the Vatican Embassy after one of his commanders, Luis del Cid,
surrendered to U.S. forces in David, 200 miles west of Panama City.
Del Cid was indicted in 1988 along with Noriega on drug trafficking
charges. He was flown to Miami Monday.
   Other people were seen entering the Vatican Embassy at various
times on the same day Noriega went there. Justice Department
spokesman David Runkel said Tuesday in Washington that ``10
associate thugs'' of Noriega sought asylum Sunday afternoon at the
embassy, the Papal Nunciature.

   Police on Tuesday were looking to question a
bicyclist seen riding near this small upstate New York town shortly
before a family of four was shot to death and set afire in their
suburban home.
   Warren Anthony Harris, 39, his wife, Delores, 41, their
daughter, Shelby, 15, and son, Marc, 11, were found dead Saturday
morning after neighbors in the affluent suburb of Ellis Hollow
heard their fire alarm and called authorities.
   All four had been shot once through the head between 6 p.m. and
10:30 p.m. Friday.
   Police have given no motive for the crime, although they said
some money may have been taken from the purse and wallet of the
Harris couple. Investigators said there was no evidence of a
break-in, but an inside telephone wire was pulled from the phone.
   A bicyclist riding in near zero-degree weather was seen at about
4:30 p.m. last Friday heading toward Dryden along a road where the
family lived, state police said.
   A witness saw the bicyclist but could not describe the sex, race
or age because the rider was wearing a parka, said Capt. Carl
Shaver of the state police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.
   Three of the victims were tied up in one room before being shot
while the fourth was found on the floor of another room, said Capt.
Robert J. Farrand, acting commander of state police Troop C. The
bodies of all four then were doused with gasoline and set on fire,
Farrand said.
   Violence is relatively uncommon in the area. The deaths raised
the number of killings to only six this year around Ithaca, a city
of 26,000 that is home to Cornell University. The Harrises lived
between Ithaca and Dryden, about 10 miles to the east.
   The family's van was found Saturday about 5 miles east of their
home at an Ithaca shopping center. Police believe the killer or
killers used the van to flee.
   Shaver said he felt only one person was involved in the
killings, but he said that had not been firmly established.
   Autopsies were begun Sunday at the Onondaga County Medical
Examiner's office. Results were expected to be released Wednesday
or Thursday, police said.
   ``They are doing an extremely thorough, detailed job,'' Shaver
said. Medical examiners were looking not only for the cause of
death but also for any indication of what happened to the Harrises
before they were killed.
   Deanco Inc., an Ithaca-based electronics distributor where
Warren Harris was employed as East Coast sales director, is
offering a $5,000 reward for any information that leads to an
arrest of the killer, state police said.

   Deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
defiantly denounced the revolt that toppled him from power and
refused to recognize the legitimacy of the tribunal that sentenced
him to death, a videotape of his trial showed late Tuesday.
   Waving his arms and shouting with his forlorn wife, Elena,
seated nearby, Ceausescu branded as lies the charges that the
couple was responsible for the deaths of 60,000 during their
24-year reign and the crackdown on protesters last week.
   ``Everything that was said here was false, and I don't want to
talk any more,'' he declared at one point.
   ``I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty. I will answer only in front of
the Grand National Assembly and in front of the working-class.
These are lies,'' he said as the couple sat behind a table, with no
other people in the room visible.
   Later, the videotape broadcast on Romanian television showed the
bodies of the couple sprawled by a wall after their executions
Monday by firing squad, the first confirmation for Romanians that
their revolution had been won.
   An official said the couple that ruled their country together
were granted their last wish: that their executions be carried out
simultaneously. Hundreds reportedly volunteered for the
three-member firing squad.
   The revolutionary National Salvation Committee, which says it is
a provisional government until free elections can be held in April,
chose Ion Iliescu as chairman of a new 37-member governing council
on Tuesday.
   It also named as prime minister a professor who said he
convinced the army to join the revolt.
   Additionally, the new government issued a decree that throws out
some of Ceausescu's most vicious and oppressive laws _ including
those prohibiting contact with foreigners, free travel and even
ownership of typewriters.
   The government also ordered the Interior Ministry's brutal
security forces be put under control of the Defense Ministry, which
oversees the army that sided with the revolutionaries.
   According to radio and Romanian sources, security forces loyal
to Ceausescu were surrendering by the hundreds Tuesday, apparently
convinced of defeat by news of their ousted ruler's execution.
   But sporadic gunfire still rang through parts of the capital,
where many buildings were burned or battered by the fighting
between army units backing the revolution and secret police loyal
to Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu and his wife were reported captured on Saturday and
tried and executed two days later. Television early Tuesday
broadcast the first footage of the couple in captivity, along with
the film of their bodies.
   The 71-year-old Ceausescu looked gaunt and unshaven and denied
that he ordered the brutal suppression during last week's protests
against his rule.
   His wife, sometimes restrained from speaking by her husband,
defiantly blasted back at unseen prosecutors accusing the family of
stashing hard currency in Swiss banks.
   ``Prove it,'' she retorted. ``This is a base provocation.''
   Ceausescu denied that there were deaths in Bucharest's Palace
Square on Thursday, when there were reports that troops fired on
protesters who turned out for his failed pro-government
demonstration.
   ``Nobody was shot in the Palace Square,'' Ceausescu said.
   ``Do you know that you were sacked as president and as supreme
commander of the army?'' the court asked at point.
   ``No, I do not recognize this. I am the president of the
Socialist Republic of Romania,'' he replied.
   The government said the couple was tried by a secret military
tribunal for grave crimes against the Romanian people, including
genocide and ruining the economy. It said the genocide involved the
deaths of more than 60,000 people during their 24 years in power.
   The government also said the couple had stashed more than $1
billion in foreign banks.
   A military officer who asked not to be identified said 300
soldiers volunteered for the firing squad, but only three were
chosen. The Ceausescus' last wish was to die together, he said.
   ``All of us wanted to see the dictator shot. You have seen it,
the dictators have been executed!'' exulted a Bucharest Radio
announcer.
   For some, however, even death was too good for Ceausescu, who
ran a network of terror with 700,000 secret police and imposed
rationing on his people while exporting food to pay for monuments
to his own glory.
   ``He should be stripped naked, and his body paraded through the
streets,'' said Dimitru Minca, whose 14-year-old grandson was among
Ceausescu's victims.
   Still in custody and facing trial was Ceausescu's eldest son,
Nicu, and a daughter, Zoia.
   Thousands of people were reported killed as Ceausescu tried to
crush burgeoning protests that began Dec. 15. The army joined the
uprising Friday, forcing Ceausescu to flee, and thousands more are
believed to have been killed during the fighting with pro-Ceausescu
forces.
   A group of dissidents, intellectuals, disaffected government
officials and rebellious army commanders have been trying to run
the nation under the umbrella name National Salvation Committee.
   On Tuesday, the committee said Iliescu, 59, would remain
chairman of the committee. Reputed to be a college chum of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he was an early rising star under
Ceausescu but was demoted in 1971 after disagreements over the
dictator's style and his pace of reform.
   It also named Petre Roman, a 43-year-old professor of hydraulic
engineeering with no political background, as prime minister.
   The government has been headquartered at the TV station, scene
of some of the heaviest fighting. During one attack Friday, Roman
told reporters he was on the committee because he helped persuade
the army to join the revolt.
   Named as defense minister was Gen. Nicolas Militaru, who retired
eight years ago from the army as commander of the Bucharest
garrison, one of many military men toppled by Ceausescu, whose
distrust of the army grew after an attempted military coup in 1984.
   Because of the new decree, Militaru's duties now will include
command of all security troops. Under the new law, the only
paramilitary units under the Interior Ministry will be traffic
police, firefighters and prison guards.
   The changes also scrap laws forbidding unauthorized contact with
foreigners requiring intellectuals to live in the same city where
they work _ a measure frequently used to banish outspoken voices to
remote towns.
   Laws prohibiting abortions to women with less than five children
and requiring registration of typewriters also were abolished, as
were Ceausescu's plans to destroy thousands of villages and force
people into shoddy new housing in towns.
   About 10 new political parties have been formed since Saturday,
all weak and badly organized, and a small but noisy demonstration
has already denounced the new government, some of whose members
have promised free elections.
   About a thousand people gathered outside of the Central
Committee building to demand that no Communists be included in any
new government. They objected that the television station refused
to cover them.
   ``These are the first days of liberty and already they are
suppressing us,'' said Christian Radulescu, a doctor.

   Romanian TV on Tuesday broadcast
footage of the secret trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, showing
the dictator and his wife defiant, unrepentant and dismissive of
the tribunal that sentenced them to death.
   Ceausescu, gaunt and looking his 71 years, repeatedly told the
court he would answer only to the country's rubber-stamp parliament
``and the working-class'' for his actions.
   His wife, restrained from speaking several times when her
husband put his hand on her arm or leg, blasted back at unseen
prosecutors accusing the family of stashing cash in Swiss banks.
   ``Prove it,'' she retorted. ``This is a base provocation.''
   Ceausescu alternately remained silent after questions about his
24 years of dictatorial policy, or shouted replies in the raised
voice he used in his most strident speeches.
   ``Everything that was said here was false, and I don't want to
talk any more,'' he said.
   ``This was a coup d'etat and I don't answer your questions,'' he
proclaimed at another point.
   The couple sat silently as the indictment was read, charging
them with genocide of more than 60,000 people, the undermining of
the state and the economy, the destruction of historic monuments
and attempting to flee by hiding more than $1 billion in foreign
banks.
   Ceausescu refused to answer key questions about who ordered the
Dec. 17 shooting of unarmed civilians in the western city of
Timisoara that precipated the popular rage that drove him from
power.
   Elena Ceausescu, who was effectively in charge of Romania Dec.
18-20 while her husband was in Iran, acted unconcerned when asked
if she knew of the shooting in Timsisoara.
   ``What are you talking about?'' she demanded.
   ``Who ordered the shooting in Bucharest?'' a voice asked,
referring to the shooting of protesters in Bucharest last Thursday,
a day before the army backed the revolt and the Ceausescus were
forced to flee.
   ``Nobody was shot in the Palace Square,'' Ceausescu said. He was
referring to the square where he addressed a pro-government rally
Thursday that backfired and turned into a demonstration against him.
   The Ceausescus were captured Saturday in an underground bunker
at an undisclosed location. They were tried, sentenced and shot to
death by firing squad on Monday.
   Earlier Tuesday, the television broadcast scenes of their
bullet-ridden bodies slumped against a wall. A close-up showed
Ceausescu's face, his eyes open and blood on the right side.
   It has not been disclosed where and exactly when they were tried
and shot after the secret trial.
   ``Do you know what's happening now? Why are these people
fighting in the street?'' the prosecutor demanded, referring to
street battles between security troops loyal to Ceausescu and the
army, which backs the revolutionaries.
   ``The people are fighting the gangs of traitors who in collusion
with foreign forces organized this coup d'etat,'' Ceausescu
answered.
   ``Do you know that you were sacked as a president and a supreme
commander of the army?'' the prosecutor asked.
   ``No, I do not recognize this. I am the President of the
Socialist Republic of Romania,'' Ceausescu replied.
   Asked why he exported food grown in the country and left his own
people scraping by on meager rations, Ceausescu characteristically
cited the inflated statistics he loved to use to justify his
Stalinist policies.
   ``It's a lie that the people are hungry,'' he said.
   ``Why were the peasants going to Bucharest to buy bread?''
retorted the prosecutor. Ceausescu was silent.
   At another point in the 40-minute broadcast, he defended his
hated plan to ``systemize'' the countryside by moving peasants from
villages to shoddy new housing in agro-industrial centers. He
claimed the plan would bring more civilization to Romania's
tradition-rich peasantry.
   ``I didn't want to destroy the villages, on the contrary it was
a buildup of villages, they were supposed to get doctors,
schools,'' he said.
   ``It was an improvement, not a destruction. They were to be the
best villages in the world.''
   The couple also was asked about the luxurious lifestyle of their
daughter Zoia-Elena, captured by soldiers on Sunday.
   Television has shown footage of her opulent villa, containing
jewels and other artifacts from national museums and her two
lapdogs, said to have been fed with imported meat weighed on golden
scales.
   ``We don't have any villa,'' Ceausescu defiantly replied. Both
he and his wife laughed when asked about the imported meat for pets.
   ``We lived like normal citizens. It's incredible what you are
accusing us of,'' Ceausescu said.
   ``Did you ever suffer from any mental disorder?'' Elena was
asked at one point.
   ``Oh, what a base provocation,'' answered the woman who only a
week ago reigned supreme in Romania.

   Iran recognized Romania's new government
Tuesday and lawmakers demanded to know why Nicolae Ceausescu was
warmly welcomed to the Tehran just days before he was deposed and
executed, Iranian media reported.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the Foreign Ministry
announced recognition of the provisional government in Bucharest.
   ``Iran's Foreign Ministry is certain that the two nations' ties
will continue, and that after the establishment of the popular
government in Romania, these relations will expand,'' the statement
said.
   The ministry also informed the Romanian ambassador in Tehran
that Iran's Red Crescent Society, the Moslem equivalent of the Red
Cross, is ready to send medical aid to Bucharest to help people
wounded in the fighting that toppled Ceausescu, the radio reported.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
Majlis, or parliament, summoned Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
to explain Ceausescu's official visit to Tehran from Dec. 18-20.
   Ceausescu was deposed by a popular uprising on Friday. He and
his wife, Elena, were executed Monday after they were found guilty
during a secret military trial of genocide and other ``grave
crimes'' during his 24-year rule.
   Ceausescu left for Iran in the midst of huge protests against
his rule. His security forces fired on demonstrators, reportedly
killing thousands. On Friday, the army turned against him, and
Ceausescu was forced to flee his palace.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the issue of Ceausescu's
visit was ``snowballing as the biggest goof of the Iranian Foreign
Ministry.''
   The government appears increasingly embarrassed by its embrace
of Ceausescu, who also had close ties with China. China on Tuesday,
seeking to avoid any comparisons to its own crackdown on protesters
in June, succeeded in blocking debate on Romania by the U.N.
Security Council in New York.
   The Iranian news agency said 45 deputies in the 270-seat Majlis
demanded that Velayati appear.
   The Majlis Foreign Relations Committee, which met with Velayati
a day earlier, said Tuesday that his answers to their questions
``were not satisfactory enough.''
   No details of the exchange were provided, but the Majlis and
Velayati sit in opposing political camps in Iran. The Majlis is
dominated by hard-liners of the Islamic revolution opposed to
opening Iran to foreign investment and other pragmatic measures
that Velayati supports.
   IRNA said in an earlier report that Velayati ordered Iran's
ambassador to Bucharest, Mohammad Jamshid Gowhari, be fired.
   IRNA said the dismissal ``was due to Gowhari's failure to
furnish the foreign ministry with a comprehensive report on the
internal situation in Romania'' before Ceausescu's visit.
   Gowhari was dismissed only three months before he was due to
return to Tehran, IRNA reported.
   Ceausescu was given a red carpet welcome in Tehran. Romania was
Iran's second-biggest trading partner in Eastern Europe and during
Ceausescu's visit he signed an agreement to buy 1 million barrels
of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year.
   He met President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who termed Ceausescu's
visit ``successful'' and noted that the grounds for economic
cooperation were ``completely fertile.''
   After Ceausescu left and reports from Romania illustrated the
brutality of his regime, Iranian newspapers demanded an official
explanation why the Romanian leader had been allowed to visit
Tehran.
   Velayati responded Sunday by saying the visit had been arranged
after frequent requests from Bucharest. But he stressed that
Iranian leaders repeatedly advised Ceausescu to ``bow to his
people's demands'' while he was in Tehran.
   Iran also has denied European reports that Iranians were
fighting alongside Ceausescu's security police against rebel forces
and that Ceausescu had stashed a fortune in gold in Tehran banks.
   During Ceausescu's visit, IRNA praised Romania as ``the sole
East European country rigidly adhering to its past government,'' a
reference to the reform movements that have changed Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany.
   Iran's state-run television network lauded Ceausescu while he
was in Tehran. This week, it broadcast commentaries criticizing his
rule.
   IRNA claimed Tuesday that Ceausescu ``received a cold welcome''
and said that Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
``called off a scheduled meeting with him.''
   The agency also said that while Ceausescu was in Tehran,
``protests were made'' in the Iranian parliament about the visit.
None of the reported protests were mentioned by Iran's
state-controlled media while Ceausescu was in Tehran.

   Workers pulled two more bodies Tuesday out of the
charred remains of a downtown rooming house that was set on fire
over the weekend, bringing the death toll to six.
   The blaze occurred Saturday after a pile of garbage was set on
fire in a hallway, causing about $600,000 damage to the building.
   Police have charged a Toronto man with three counts of
second-degree murder. Gordon Freeman, 49, is to appear in
provincial court Wednesday.
   Police constable Bill Thomson said police will file further
charges after they are certain there are no more bodies.
   The 60 residents left homeless by the fire were given turkey
dinners at a Salvation Army shelter Christmas Day. Spokesman Harold
Zimmerman said the Salvation Army will help them find permanent
homes later this week.

   Joel Jacobson, a no-nonsense former New
Jersey casino regulator who once called Frank Sinatra ``an
obnoxious bully'' and was later appointed court trustee of a
scandal-ridden Teamsters local, died Tuesday. He was 71.
   Jacobson, a South Orange resident, died about 3:25 a.m. at Saint
Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, said a hospital spokeswoman who
asked that her name not be used. She said she could not release a
cause of death.
   ``I am saddened at the death of Joel Jacobson,'' Gov. Thomas H.
Kean said in a statement. ``He was an individual of strong and
firmly held positions and possessed a willingness to express them
forcefully and articulately. He fought for his beliefs, both as a
public servant and as a private citizen.''
   Jacobson, a longtime labor union official, joined the state
Casino Control commission in 1981. His tenure was marked by his
vote against issuing a gaming license to Hilton Corp. and his
run-in with Sinatra.
   In 1984, he characterized the singer as someone who ``walks into
a casino and exhibits himself like an obnoxious bully, forcing men
and women to commit infractions because of the fear of losing their
jobs.''
   The comment came after Sinatra and fellow entertainer Dean
Martin forced a blackjack dealer at the former Golden Nugget casino
to deal from her hand instead of a plastic ``shoe'' which holds the
cards. Jacobson's remark so angered Sinatra that he refused to
perform in the state for a time.
   Outgoing Casino Control Commission Chairman Walter N. Read said
Jacobson never feared letting others know what he thought.
   ``Joel had a lot of influence in a lot of areas for a long
period of time,'' Read said.
   Jacobson resigned from the commission in June 1986 and was
appointed by U.S. District Judge Harold Ackerman to run Union
City-based Teamsters Local 560. Ackerman had ruled in February 1984
that the 8,000-member Local 560 had suffered under ``an orgy of
criminal activity'' for 25 years.
   In May 1987, Ackerman removed Jacobson, saying ``more needs to
be done in order to insure that the documented egregious pattern of
racketeering activity does not re-emerge the moment that the
trusteeship is ended.''
   Jacobson later accused the government of trying to bust the
union with the appointment of Edwin H. Stier, a former assistant
U.S. attorney and director of the state Division of Criminal
Justice. The union in 1988 held a government monitored election and
returned to self-administration.
   In 1974, Jacobson became a member of the state Board of Public
Utilities and its president in 1976.
   He became the first commissioner of the state Department of
Energy _ now part of the state Department of Commerce, Energy and
Economic Development _ upon its creation in 1977.

   Accidents on the nation's roads and highways
claimed 353 lives during the four-day Christmas weekend, but the
death toll was lower than last year's.
   California had the highest number of fatalities with 48,
followed by Texas with 28 and Florida with 27.
   The death toll was well within estimates made by the
Chicago-based National Safety Council, which had predicted that
from 320 to 420 people would die in traffic accidents during the
holiday weekend.
   The official counting period began at 6 p.m. local time Friday
and ended at 11:59 p.m. local time Monday.
   The council said its estimates were based on data from previous
years, seasonal weather factors and national driving safety trends.
During last year's Christmas holiday, 386 traffic fatalities were
reported.
   For the New Year's holiday period, the council estimates that
between 250 and 350 people could die in road accidents, compared
with 317 last year. The New Year's counting period begins at 6 p.m.
local time Friday and runs through 11:59 p.m. local time Monday.

   Blustery cold weather and high
upper-level winds Tuesday forced Martin Marietta Corp. to postpone
its first commercial rocket launch for a sixth time.
   Wednesday's scheduled launch of the Titan 3, with British and
Japanese communications satellites aboard, has been rescheduled to
7:05 p.m. EST Thursday, said Martin Marietta spokesman Robert V.
Gordon.
   ``Air currents in the upper atmosphere are too strong'' and
recent near-freezing temperatures were too low for the Titan 3 to
be launched safely, Gordon said.
   Wednesday's lows for the Cape Canaveral area were expected to be
in the 40s, which would chill the Titan 3's solid fuel boosters to
levels that are unacceptable for launching. Temperatures ``need to
be in the 60s,'' he said.
   The rocket will carry Skynet 4A, a satellite for the British
Defense Ministry, and JCSAT-2, a satellite for the Japanese
Satellite Communications Co.
   Martin Marietta has been trying to launch the Titan 3 since Dec.
7. The company's foray into the highly competitive international
commercial space business has been delayed four times due to bad
weather and once because of a computer software problem.

   The following is an account of fighting in Timisoara filed on
Tuesday by Anatoly Bocharov, a special correspondent for the Soviet
news agency Tass:

<TEXT>
   TIMISOARA, Romania _ Shots can still be heard in Timisoara, a
city in the western part of Romania. There are killed and wounded.
Supporters of the overthrown dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, mostly the
personnel of the former security service Securitate, continue to
offer armed resistance to the insurgents.
   In an attempt to hide from popular indignation, the extremists
try to flee the city. As a rule, they take these desperate steps at
night, firing at random at passers-by. We learned from our own
experience that the insurgents had a good reason, when taking
measures for ensuring the safety of work and travel of foreign
journalists in Timisoara and in the area around it. Eight
journalists were wounded. Danny Huwe, a Belgian journalist, was
shot dead by extremists on Monday. His car in which he was driving
together with his three colleagues was fired at by anti-insurgent
sharp-shooters.
   Army units are combing Timisoara districts and separate
buildngs. They are acting in close cooperation with the democratic
committee which assumed the duty to bring the situation in the city
back to normal.
   Facts show that they are facing a strong and treacherous enemy
trained in advance to stage repressions against the population. For
example, a regular arms cache was found in the house of one of the
heads of the security force. It is believed that there are many
such arms caches in the houses of security officers. This is the
explanation for continuing armed clashes in the streets of the city.
   Members of the democratic committee told Tass that the
Securitate had been created to serve as the mainstay of the ousted
regime. It had included well-equipped specialized units and a large
network of informers.
   One should see the eyes of the people looking at the arrests of
extremists. They are full of tears, of grief over the death of
defenseless people during the shooting of the demonstration and
hatred for the totalitarian regime.
   There is no doubt that the last hotbeds of resistance will soon
be suppressed. The situation in the city is getting back to normal
with difficulty and step by step. Residents met with satisfaction
the order of the National Salvation Front of Romania that all the
armaments should be urgently handed over to the authorities. People
heeded the appeal of the democratic committee to return to their
working places. Some grocery shops were opened. Tram, trolleybus
and bus traffic was resumed.
   Victor and Victoria are now the most popular names in the city.
To commemorate the victory of the people, they were given to its
youngest residents, a boy and a girl, who were born after the
overthrow of the regime. A proposal is being discussed in Timisoara
to make Dec. 22, the day when the revolutionary rejuvenation of
Romania was started, a national holiday.
   On our way from Timisoara to Yugoslavia, we saw trucks carrying
the Red Cross flag. They were transporting to Romania food,
medicines and clothes. Aid to the Romanian people that suffered
from the ousted regime is coming from many countries.

   Security forces in Iran broke up three
heroin smuggling rings, seizing millions of dollars of the drug and
arresting 24 people, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said
Tuesday.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said members of the Islamic
Revolution Committees in the northwestern province of West
Azerbaijan confiscated 247 pounds of heroin worth an estimated $7.5
million the past few days.
   Security officers also seized a cache of weapons and ammunition,
IRNA said.
   The report said those arrested confessed to plans to bring three
tons of narcotics into the province, which borders Turkey and Iraq.
   Iran says it has arrested thousands of smugglers and pushers,
executing at least 1,000 since authorities launched a nationwide
anti-narcotics campaign last year.
   But opposition groups and human rights organizations say many
political prisoners are among those executed.

   A fire that killed 16 people in a
high-rise retirement center started on the first floor, but
investigators have not narrowed down the cause, the city's fire
chief said Tuesday.
   ``I don't think we are looking at arson here. I don't think
we're looking into anything criminal,'' said Paul Souder, assistant
to Chief Doug Buckles.
   The Christmas Eve blaze, the second fatal fire in the John
Sevier center in two months, spread to the second floor and parts
of the third floor of the 10-story building. Smoke traveled to all
floors before firefighters brought the fire under control.
   Grant Trivett and his father, U.G. Trivett Jr., managed the
retirement center, which was renovated as an apartment hotel for
the retired in 1979, a year after the hotel closed. It was built as
a hotel in 1924.
   ``This was an apartment house, with the residents all supposed
to be able to care for themselves, cook their own meals and keep
their own places clean,'' Grant Trivett said. It was not a nursing
home, he said.
   ``We were planning to upgrade our facility with a sprinkler
system,'' he said. ``We didn't feel uncomfortable about it. We felt
it would be a good investment.''
   Souder said a sprinkler system ``would have held (the fire) in
check until we got there.''
   The center, which housed 145 residents, has long concerned city
officials, said City Manager John Campbell.
   ``You have to be concerned any time you have so many elderly
people in a 10-story building,'' Campbell said.
   When the building was opened as a retirement center in 1979 it
was brought up to code, Campbell said, but the building code at
that time did not require sprinklers.
   Sprinklers are required under present code only if renovations
are being done.
   State Rep. Bob Good said the Tennessee Legislature may have to
consider requiring sprinkler systems in older buildings after it
reconvenes Jan. 9.
   In October, a 76-year-old resident, Joseph England, died of
smoke inhalation a few days after a kerosene heater flared, caught
his fifth floor apartment on fire. All residents were evacuated.
   Police said people wanting to retrieve personal belongings would
be allowed inside the building later in the week.
   ``City crews are working to remove equipment and ice from the
building to make it safe for citizens to enter the facility,''
Police Chief Ron Street said.
   The American Red Cross was assisting those displaced by the
fire. The agency said it received a donation of $10,000 from
Mor-Flo Industries, a water-heater manufacturer based in Cleveland
with a factory in Johnson City.

<TEXT>
   Joseph A. Livingston, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporter whose ``Business Outlook'' column appeared
in more than 50 newspapers across the country, has died at age 84.
   Livingston's wife, Rosalie, said she found her husband collapsed
Monday near the doorway of their farmhouse in Pipersville, 35 miles
north of Philadelphia. He was taken to Doylestown Hospital, where
he was pronounced dead.
   A hospital spokeswoman declined to give any details of
Livingston's death Tuesday.
   ``He was one of the outstanding journalists of his time,'' said
Eugene L. Roberts Jr., executive editor of The Philadelphia
Inquirer and president of Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.
   Livingston started his twice-weekly column in 1945 and used the
Inquirer as his base from 1972 until his death. He also was
financial editor of the now-defunct Bulletin in Philadelphia from
1948 to 1968, and held the same title briefly at the Philadelphia
Record before that newspaper closed in 1947.
   The Inquirer said Livingston's twice-yearly survey of economists
was one of the nation's first consensus economic forecasts.
   He won his Pulitzer in 1964 for a series of articles titled
``The Power Pull of the Dollar.'' They described how communist
countries, particularly those of Eastern Europe, were being pulled
toward the West by a variety of economic forces.
   Livingston received a number of other awards in business
journalism, including the Loeb Award four times, the Hancock Award
three times and the Overseas Press Club award for excellence in
business reporting from abroad three times.
   Livingston said he developed an interest in economics after he
and a group of friends got together one night and decided to invest
jointly in the stock market. That was in September 1929. The stock
market crashed the next month, heralding the Great Depression.
   ``I decided then that I ought to find out more about business
and finance,'' Livingston once said.
   He took courses at City College of New York and became editor of
a business publication called the New York Daily Investment News.
   In 1935, he became editor and economist at Business Week, a post
he held for seven years. While there, he successfully argued in
favor of writing about the U.S. interest in the war in Europe.
   ``I was a pariah among the isolationists,'' he said. ``But I
said it was our war, that we should enter into it, that it would be
a disaster for Hitler to win.''
   After the United States entered the war, Livingston went to
Washington to work as an economist for the War Production Board and
later the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion.
   He began his column in 1945, when his first client was The
Washington Post. He started his survey of economists in 1946.
   In 1978, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve computerized the
information from Livingston's previous surveys and today continues
to produce the Livingston survey.
   He is survived by his wife and a daughter, Patricia Herban, and
a grandson.

   An 83-year-old man who often argued
heatedly with his stepdaughter shot her and his wife dead on
Christmas Day, then killed himself, police said Tuesday.
   Donnie Carlisle shot his wife, Virginia, 80, in the head, and
his stepdaughter, Carolyn Dempsey, 53, in the head and chest about
7 p.m. Monday, Lt. Michael A. Butler said. He then left the house
and went to the nearby home of his daughter, Butler said.
   ``I just shot Virginia, I just shot Carolyn, and now I'm going
to shoot myself,'' Mary Davis said her father told her.
   Ms. Davis said she tried to stop her father, but he knocked her
down, went back to his house and shot himself in the head and
chest, Butler said. Carlisle died about two hours later at Self
Memorial Hospital, he said.
   Officers found a .22-caliber rifle in the Carlisles' living room
that apparently was used in the shootings.
   Ms. Davis told investigators her father threatened to kill the
women and himself on Saturday after arguing with Ms. Dempsey. Ms.
Davis said she talked her father out of it.
   ``He stayed at her house about half the day just talking about
how he was being treated,'' the police report said.
   Ms. Davis told investigators ``there were always very heated
arguments'' between her father and Ms. Dempsey. Police did not say
what those arguments were about.

   State House Speaker James J. Manderino
collapsed and died at his home early Tuesday, just hours before his
plan to retire next year was to be announced, an aide said. He was
57.
   Manderino was stricken as he was getting out of bed at his home
in Monessen, 25 miles south of Pittsburgh, said an aide, Charles
Bacas. The cause of death was not immediately known.
   Bacas said he had planned to issue a statement Tuesday
announcing that Manderino would retire when his 12th House term
ended next December. Manderino had just completed his first year as
speaker after serving previously as Democratic leader.
   Manderino was known for his sharp tongue and his once-immense
stature. He weighed a reported 350 pounds before recently shedding
more than 100 pounds.
   A reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer once said of him: ``As
a politician, he prefers vinegar to honey. Even his strongest
political supporters don't really like him. Even his most bitter
enemies respect him.''
   Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey issued a statement mourning the
loss of ``a true champion.''
   Manderino was ``a leader of extraordinary ability and a master
of the legislative process,'' Casey said. ``He was a strong ally of
this administration in working to enact programs to clean up our
environment and improve our economy.''
   Manderino, a lawyer, was first elected to the House in 1966.
   The House is scheduled to return for a token session Jan. 2 and
for a voting session Jan. 22. Under state law, Majority Leader
Robert O'Donnell, a Philadelphia Democrat, will serve as speaker
until a replacement is elected.
   Manderino is survived by five children, three sisters and one
brother.

   Several nations and the human rights group Amnesty
International criticized Romania's new leaders Tuesday for
executing dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife without a public
trial, saying a free Romania should live by the rule of law.
   But there also were expressions of understanding of the
treatment meted out to the Ceausescus, and the country's new
government gained increasing international support.
   By Wednesday, at least 18 countries _ including such past
Ceausescu supporters as China, North Korea and Iran _ had
recognized Romania's National Salvation Committee, which overthrew
Ceausescu Friday following a popular uprising.
   Tons of international aid streamed into Romania.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a message to
Romania's leader of the new provisional government, Ion Iliescu,
noting that he ``took charge of the country at a difficult moment
when Romanian patriots resolutely came out to save the nation from
forces of despotism and terror.''
   In the message, carried by the official news agency Tass,
Gorbachev assured the new government of Soviet support.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry called the executions of the
Ceausescus an internal affair. Spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said the
decision ``has probably been made taking into account the
aspirations and will of the Romanian people.''
   The United States joined several nations in criticizing the
secret trial, and the Italian office of Amnesty International
deplored the executions.
   ``The idea that the use of the death penalty can survive during
the passage from the old regime to a democratic system provokes
worry,'' the human rights group said.
   The Dutch government said it was ``concerned'' and expressed
hope that ``the high principles of the rule of law will find their
place in the new Romania for which so many have fought to the
utmost.''
   The Dutch said, however, that Ceausescu was responsible ``for
the inhuman suffering inflicted on the Romanian people'' and said
they were ``willing to take into account the possible connection''
between his death and efforts to quickly end ``the senseless
bloodshed'' caused by elite police units loyal to the dictator.
   In Britain, a Foreign Office spokesman said normal accepted
standards were difficult during ``a civil war situation.''
   ``Although one may regret a secret trial, at the time it was not
really surprising,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom
was not identified.
   But George Robertson of the opposition Labor Party called the
secret trial ``a sad birth to the new nation.''
   Iolanda Stranescu, president of the British Romanian
Association, echoed his assessment, saying: ``Our feeling is
Ceausescu should have had a public trial. It is not an excellent
start for the new government.''
   Fund-raising for Romania gained momentum worldwide.
   Two West German military planes carrying medical supplies and
other relief equipment landed in Bucharest Tuesday and the German
Red Cross prepared a convoy to leave by land.
   The British Red Cross, which launched an appeal Saturday, said
Tuesday that it had received as many as 12,000 callers an hour and
had raised more than $700,000. It said it had sent 30 tons of drugs
and medical supplies to Romania.
   Libya's official news agency JANA said Libya was sending a
planeload of medicine. Libya again denied that Libyans were
participating in events in Romania on the side of the pro-Ceausescu
forces, JANA said.
   Czechoslovakia sent two cargo planes with medical aid and food
to Bucharest, following two trains and ambulance convoys sent over
the weekend, the official CTK news agency said.
   In Israel, where 400,000 Romanian immigrants and their
descendants live, a two-hour radio show was held Tuesday to seek
donations and pass on information about Jews in Romania.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry planned to send a six-ton shipment of
medical supplies to Bucharest. Israel Radio said two
Romanian-speaking doctors would accompany the supplies.
   Britain, Chile, China, Colombia, Greece, Hungary, Spain and Iran
on Tuesday joined the United States, the Soviet Union and at least
nine other nations in pledging support for the National Salvation
Committee.
   On Wednesday, the official (North) Korean Central News Agency
said communist North Korea recognized the new government. KCNA was
monitored in Tokyo.
   ``We respect the road chosen by the Romanian people and
recognize the Council of the Romanian National Salvation Front as
the representative of the Romanian people,'' read a statement of
the North Korean Foreign Ministry, quoted by the agency.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said in a statement that
hostilities between Hungary and Romania were at an end, and pledged
his government's support for the new leadership.
   Relations between the two countries were traditionally strained
over Hungary's claims that the ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania
was discriminated against under Ceausescu.
   Tensions aggravated as Hungary increasingly embraced democratic
reforms while Ceausescu remained staunchly opposed to such reforms.
   Iran announced its recognition hours after dismissing its
ambassador to Bucharest for failing to inform Tehran of growing
opposition to Ceausescu before he visited Iran last week.
Parliament demanded that Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
explain why Ceausescu was warmly received by Iranian officials.
   The Foreign Ministry, announcing recognition of the new
government, said relations between the two countries ``will
expand.'' Romania was Iran's second-biggest trading partner in
Eastern Europe and during Ceausescu's visit he signed an agreement
to buy 1 million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a
year.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday it was ``ready to
continue to maintain and develop its friendly relations with
Romania.''
   Ceausescu maintained good relations with Beijing over decades of
hostility between China and the rest of the Soviet bloc and was one
of the few socialist leaders to praise the Chinese leadership's
crackdown of the student-led pro-democracy movement in June.

   A fire in an oil company warehouse triggered
a night-long series of explosions that shot fireballs as high as
150 feet in the air, officials said Tuesday.
   The fire at Troco Oil Co., which began Monday night, was under
control by early Tuesday afternoon, officials said. Troco officials
did not return telephone calls seeking comment, but Fire Department
spokesman Jim White said the company's owner had been notified of
the fire.
   A juvenile detention center and a shelter across from Troco were
evacuated without incident. The only injury reported was to a
firefighter whose eyes were irritated with foam. He was treated at
a hospital and released.
   Firefighters used water unsuccessfully on the fire for about 1{
hours until a Sun Co. foam truck arrived to help smother it, White
said. Sun Co. operates a nearby refinery.
   Troco ``blends oils for special applications. Everything in
there is oil or some type of lubricant,'' White said.
   ``We thought we had it with this foam, but we had trouble
getting to the seat of the fire,'' White said. ``About 1:30 or 2
a.m., we knew we were not doing any good. The oil was fueling the
fire and we started having explosion after explosion, with flames
150 feet in the air.''
   White said firefighters will spend the next couple of days
spraying hot spots at the plant, and it will be several days before
an inspection can be made to determine the cause of the fire.

<TEXT>
   Survivors of a Christmas Eve sea
accident in the southern Philippines claimed Tuesday they were
attacked by a giant octopus that overturned their motorized canoe.
   Fishermen on Monday found 12 survivors clinging to the
overturned craft and recovered the body of a two-week-old boy off
Manticao, 17 miles from where the accident took place.
   All the survivors suffered from severe sunburn but none was
seriously hurt, said Manticao police Cpl. Samuel Cabasan.
   The Philippine Navy and Coast Guard headquarters in Manila said
they had not received any report about the sinking in Iligan Bay,
about 490 miles southeast of the capital.
   ``Suddenly, the waters began to bubble,'' said survivor Agapito
Caballero. ``Then with the use of flashlights, we saw something
that looked like a giant octopus. It was as huge as an imported
cow.''
   Caballero's brother, Alfredo, whose baby boy died, said the
octopus grabbed the vessel's pontoons and overturned it. But the
octopus submerged after the attack and did not harm them, he added.
   Manila newspapers said two other passengers of the 15 who were
on the boat were found Monday. They quoted Eleuterio Sarino, the
boat owner, as saying the boat was submerged by huge waves. He did
not mention the octopus.

<TEXT>
   Vice Premier Yao Yilin, an economic expert who
helped steer China back toward more central planning, was replaced
as head of the powerful State Planning Commission by technocrat Zou
Jiahua, it was announced Tuesday.
   Zou, who headed the Machine Building and Electronics Industry,
was appointed by the National People's Congress, China's parliament.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Peng as
telling parliament that Yao was being asked to step down so he
could concentrate on helping Li with the work of the State Council,
or cabinet.
   The move did not immediately appear to signify that Yao was in
disfavor. It may be designed to groom Zou, a rising star who has
been mentioned as a future member of the Politburo.
   Yao, 72, moved into prominence the past year with his economic
policies committing China to a lengthy period of austerity,
restoring state controls over many aspects of the economy and
halting market-oriented economic reforms.
   He has worked closely with Li, another economic conservative who
has sought to reverse the fast pace of economic reforms favored by
ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang.
   Yao is one of the six members of the party's decision-making
Politburo Standing Committee, as is Li.
   The full Politburo, previously composed of 17 members, is now
down to 14 after the death in April of former party chief Hu
Yaobang and the ouster of moderates Zhao and Hu Qili in June
following the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Zou, 63, like Li, studied in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and
has a background in heavy industry.
   He has close connections with China's military through previous
offices.

   Police attacked a prison cell block
controlled by jailed drug traffickers and rescued 18 hostages held
for two days, a Justice Department spokesman said Tuesday.
   Six traffickers died and five hostages were injured in the
bloody rescue operation Monday night.
   Also Monday in Salgar, a town 167 miles north of Bogota, a group
of unidentified men massacred six farmers, the Antioquia state
governor's office reported Tuesday.
   An official communique said authorities still had not determined
the motive for the mass killing, and that no arrests had been made.
Right-wing death squads have killed scores of other peasants in the
same part of Colombia the last year.
   Later Monday, two police officers were assassinated, apparently
by members of Colombia's largest and oldest guerrilla group in La
Vega, a town 260 miles south of Bogota, the Cauca state governor's
office reported.
   The assassinations apparently were carried out by the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the communique said. The
leftist guerrilla group has increased its activity in recent
months. Last Saturday, members of the group ambushed an army patrol
and killed 10 soldiers in rural eastern Colombia.
   The Bogota prison takeover ended Monday when police gained the
release of all the hostages, including two children. A Justice
Department spokesman told The Associated Press the situation at La
Picota jail in southern Bogota had returned to normal.
   Authorities had been negotiating for two days with the
prisoners, who took the hostages after a failed jailbreak Sunday.
   After subduing guards during visiting hours, the inmates, all
jailed on drug trafficking charges, put on guards' uniforms in an
attempt to escape, Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Authorities discovered the plan and sealed off the cell block
before the prisoners could flee, El Tiempo said, citing prison
sources.
   The paper added that the cornered criminals then took hostages,
including civilians who had been visiting their jailed family
members.
   The prisoners initially protested the killing by police of
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, El Tiempo said. The Medellin cartel leader
was slain Dec. 15 in a gunfight with police on Colombia's northern
coast.
   As a condition for the hostages' release, the inmates demanded
that the administration of President Virgilio Barco end its
extradition of drug traffickers, El Tiempo said.
   The administration has sent 11 drug suspects to the United
States since last August when it decreed the policy.
   The uprising is the second by drug traffickers at a Bogota jail
in less than a week. Five prisoners died last Tuesday in a knife
battle between rival groups of convicted traffickers at another
prison facility in the capital.

   The United States is extending diplomatic
recognition to Romania's provisional government but expressing
regret that the trial of executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and
his wife Elena was conducted in secret.
   U.S. officials also are discussing how best to send emergency
aid to Romania, which has been devastated by bitter street battles
between the army and security forces loyal to Ceausescu.
   A hot line is being set up today at the State Department to
handle the many calls from Americans and Romanians wanting to
donate food and medicine.
   ``The U.S. government today established diplomatic relations
with the new legitimate government of Romania, the National
Salvation Front,'' said a statement issued by the White House on
Monday. The National Salvation Front is the name adopted by the
reform-minded leadership which assumed control of Romania after
Ceausescu was deposed last week.

   Millions of Christians jammed churches in
Eastern Europe to celebrate their first Christmas in freedom after
four decades of Communist rule, but their thoughts also went to the
brave Romanian people.
   In Prague, Leipzig, East Berlin and even in battle-ravaged
Bucharest, the spirit of defiance that had guided Eastern Europeans
to their remarkable revolutions turned into hope for a brighter
future.
   The change was striking in Berlin as people from both sides of
the technically still divided city mingled freely, attending joint
church services for the first time since the Berlin Wall was built
28 years ago.
   East Germany on Sunday began allowing visa-free travel by West
Germans and thousands used the opportunity to cross to East Berlin
to join relatives for a Christmas service.

   Taxpayers receive their annual holiday
greetings from Uncle Sam starting today, as the Internal Revenue
Service mails out more than 107 million tax forms and instruction
packages.
   The forms, which have been waiting at post offices across the
nation for weeks, should be in most taxpayers' hands before Jan. 1.
   The IRS always times the mailing, which costs $26 million for
postage and printing, to come right after the crush of Christmas
mail but soon enough to give taxpayers as much time as possible to
complete their returns before the filing deadline, which falls this
year on April 16.
   For taxpayers still reeling from the sweeping changes wrought by
the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the IRS has reassuring words: the new
forms look very much like last year's forms.

   Billy Martin, the hard drinking,
hard-nosed former Yankee manager whose on- and off-field brawls
overshadowed his accomplishments on the baseball diamond, died in
an alcohol-related traffic accident.
   He was 61.
   Martin was a passenger in a pickup truck that skidded off an icy
road in front of his farm Christmas night. The driver, longtime
friend William Reedy, 53, of Detroit, was charged with driving
while intoxicated, Broome County Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said.
   ``It's like losing part of my own family,'' said New York
Yankees' principal owner George Steinbrenner, who hired and fired
Martin five times as manager. ``He was one of a kind.''

   Owners of a high-rise retirement home
where a Christmas Eve fire killed 16 people had planned to install
a sprinkler system in the spring, the manager says.
   ``We didn't feel uncomfortable with the safety of the building.
We just had seen fires, basically on TV and other places. The
comment was made that the sprinkler system would have been a
benefit,'' Grant Trivett of M&amp;M Properties, which manages the John
Sevier Retirement Center, said Monday night.
   Trivett says the John Sevier Partnership, which owns the
11-story building, was going to have sprinklers put in at a cost of
$100,000.
   The 5-decade-old building did have water hoses on each floor and
met the fire code in effect in 1977, when it was converted from a
hotel into apartments for retirees, according to Lt. George
Leonard, fire marshal for this eastern Tennessee city of 40,000.

   Most states have some sort of law restricting liquor sales on
Sundays. So when New Year's Eve falls on a Sunday, as it does this
year, it's a less-than-festive holiday for those who make a living
selling alcohol.
   ``I think it will hurt the industry,'' said Ray Brezzo, who owns
a liquor store in Glastonbury, Conn. ``We're very, very
pessimistic.''
   In Connecticut, as in many Northeastern states, bars and
restaurants can serve alcohol on Sundays but liquor stores can't
sell it. For New Year's Eve, Brezzo is hoping his customers will
buy what they need on Saturday _ but he's far from confident.
   ``Nobody knows what to expect,'' he said. ``Everybody's sort of
sitting on the edge of their seat.''

<HEAD>Andy Rooney Views the Year in Review</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most reporters dread the end of a year. This is
because they are told to write a long story about the year's major
stories and what it all means. But there are those who enjoy such
work.
   His name is Andy Rooney. He is at CBS News and he gets to grouse
on ``60 Minutes'' each week. This Thursday, he has 60 minutes of
his own _ a little less, technically speaking _ to grouse or be
amused about this year.
   His show, ``A Year With Andy Rooney: 1989,'' will arrive two
nights after ABC News' ``Images of the Eighties'' and one after NBC
News' ``The Eighties.'' Those are specials about the decade, not
just one little year.
   Rooney, who is more comfortable with a year, doesn't mind doing
``year-enders,'' as they're called by journalists.
   ``As a writer, it's a lot of fun. All you need is something to
write about. And here it is, all sitting there for you. And every
event spurs an idea or observation. It's a great thing for an
essayist.''
   He is asked if this week's print and broadcast flood of
year-enders and decade-enders has any real virtue.
   ``Well,'' he muses, ``does virtue have any real virtue? But I
think if looking at where we've been helps us where we're going,
yes, to that extent they have some virtue.''
   Rooney, 68, has done five other one-hour essays of the kind
airing Thursday. The last was in 1985, when he took a helicopter
across the United States for a bird's-eye perspective of the nation.
   In preparing a gimlet-eye perspective of 1989, he went by
subject, rather than proceeding chronologically. Business,
education, guns, communism's decline, and even certain TV people
were among the subjects inspected.
   For example, he notes that ABC's Diane Sawyer was induced to
leave CBS for $2 million a year ``and the chance to work with Sam
Donaldson.''
   In contrast, Connie Chung, in leaving NBC for CBS, ``only got
$1.5 million. But she got to work alone.''
   Rooney began work on ``1989'' last summer. When interviewed last
week, he had just heard bad news from CBS officialdom. They said
that what he turned in exceeded an hour by one minute.
   This is not good, as he only really has 47 minutes he can call
his own. Commercials and promotions for other shows get the rest of
the hour. He returns with heavy heart and producer Robert Forte to
the editing room and starts throwing things out.
   A reflection on the death of the famous race horse Secretariat
runs 24 seconds. Out. Who won the Superbowl, the World Series, and
lesser championships run 40 seconds. Adios.
   The obituary of the anguished announcer who reported the flaming
crash of the dirigible Hindenberg in 1937 took 40 seconds. Farewell
to that, likewise a slightly shorter thought on former Secretary of
Defense nominee John Tower.
   ``A lot of good weather'' got the boot, too, Rooney says,
``although we kept Hurricane Hugo.''
   Thirty seconds here, 40 there, 16 here, it adds up. But it is a
heartbreaking task taking it all out after all that work to put it
all in. On the bright side, Rooney does have 47 minutes.
   ``They're doing the decade on the (CBS) `Evening News' in two
seven-minute sections,'' he marvels. ``How the hell do they do
that?''

<HEAD>Upcoming: The Big Experiment With Market Economies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps no decade this century has begun amid
greater economic unpheaval, challenge and potential than the 1990s,
and it isn't due solely to the fall of Communist regimes in Eastern
Europe.
   Western Europe too is in the midst of historic changes scheduled
to begin in little more than a year with integration of the
European Economic Community. Japan is facing adjustments because of
competition.
   The American challenge is as big as any of them. It must
solidify the great accomplishments of the 1980s, bring down
inflation, steer the way through an economic downturn, reduce the
trade deficit and balance budgets.
   Japan, which ascended to economic dominance in many trade areas
during the 1980s, is faced with demands to make its economy more
receptive to imports, to reduce its trade surplus and perhaps to
develop its infrastructure.
   China is trying to lift itself to world economic standards in
the production of goods. Hong Kong faces a change of sponsorship
from Britain to China. Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and other
small Asian nations face the challenge of remaining competitive
while lifting living standards.
   Confronted with evidence of superior lifestyles in more highly
developed countries, much of Africa, Latin America and the Mideast
are in political and economic ferment that no longer can be
repressed.
   Amid the confusion, there are few blueprints for the future so
carefully defined as that of the European Economic Community. There
is no clear procedure for turning centrally planned economies into
market economies.
   Nor is there time to develop plans. Instant communication
produces instant change, but contributes little toward identifying
programs for carrying out the changes. The demands for change are
swift, the implementation remains slow.
   Through all of the changes, however, there is at least one
constant factor, opportunity.
   For major trading nations it means new markets. For
underdeveloped nations it means the chance to radically lift
depressed living standards. For all nations it means a more
productive allocation of resources and skills.
   Managed well, the changes could be a great leap forward for the
world community. Prospects for Western Europe, for example, already
had brightened with the scheduled removal of trade barriers among
12 nations in 1992.
   Now, says Albert Cox Jr., economic analyst with the investment
counseling firm Bil, Trainer Wortham Inc., ``there is the
possibility of massive growth in international trade in the next 10
years.''
   If that happens, he concludes, ``history tells us that greatly
enhanced world economic prosperity will be the end result.''
   No matter what economic changes occur throughout the world, they
are bound to have an impact on domestic politics and economic
direction within the United States.
   Already Washington is debating the possibilities of the
so-called peace dividend, or billions of dollars in funds that
supposedly will be available as a result of a cutback in defense
programs. But that is only the beginning.
   If the world's experimentation with market economies continues,
it will provide a showcase for those seeking to direct the American
economy toward the most efficient ends.
   Conceivably, it could even mean an approach to that long-sought
American goal of shrinking the federal government while maintaining
and even improving services to the public.

   It was the unfinished symphony of the Cold War,
all sour notes, now a relic of superpower chicanery that Uncle Sam
will spend $270 million to tear down and replace: the office
building of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, riddled with KGB bugs,
never occupied. AP Special Correspondent Saul Pett records the
bizarre saga of the way things were before the Communist meltdown.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is now 20 years since the United States and
the Soviet Union agreed to build new embassies for each other in
Moscow and Washington. In that time, it is said, the ancient
Egyptians built the Great Pyramid of Cheops.
   The pharaohs didn't have to deal with the Soviets. The U.S.
Embassy is still not finished and won't be.
   Eight stories up, $170 million spent, water and ice ravaging the
most expensive bricks in the world, the administration in
Washington has now decided to stop there, raze the building to the
ground and start over.
   That will add five more years, an additional $270 million to the
cost of a modern tale of two cities, a lumbering farce of
pachyderms unique to the late unpleasantness called the Cold War.
Walls come down, liberty soars, but in the new age we are left with
monuments to the buffoonery of the old.
   The United States finished the Soviet Embassy in Washington, but
the Soviets couldn't move into their chancery until the United
States moved into its chancery in Moscow. That was by agreement,
one of several that took 13 years to reach in tense, careful
negotiations. Every major move had to be precise, simultaneous and
symmetrical. It was like two Mafia families trying to arrange a
truce for a wedding.
   It took less than two years to build the 102-story Empire State
Building in New York in 1931. In Moscow, the Soviets were into year
seven and still not finished with the eight-story office building
of the U.S. Embassy when the United States threw them out.
   The problem was bugs. Mysterious, multitudinous, ubiquitous,
anti-American, subversive, pre-glasnost, godless Russian communist
bugs.
   In columns and walls, in concrete and steel, in breathtaking
numbers and novel ways that confounded American experts, we were
told, the Soviets had sown the chancery with diabolic devices to
overhear, record and transmit American secrets.
   The United States refused to move in until the bugs were moved
out, but getting them out appeared tougher than evicting a poor
relative. So tough, in fact, two administrations spent four years
figuring out what to do. Both concluded the only safe course was to
build a new building.
   Historically, there is no louder uproar among politicians and
press than the thunder evoked by the suggestion that foreigners,
especially the backward Soviets, had outwitted Uncle Sam. The
devilish dither of the embassies had all the makings.
   Sites. After 10 years of negotiations, we gave them Mount Alto
along Wisconsin Avenue, one of the highest points in Washington.
They gave us a plot along Konyushovskaya Ulitsa down near the
Moscow River.
   Uproar. The United States had given away a strategic height from
which, electronically, the KGB could look down the throats of the
White House and Pentagon!
   ``The view is terrific'' but the intelligence advantage is
``considerably less,'' said James Schlesinger, former director of
the Central Intelligence Agency. What's more, other witnesses
testified, Mount Alto was not the Soviet's first choice for an
embassy and in Moscow, the United States had turned down an offer
of Lenin Hills to be ``downtown.'' The high-low plot wouldn't play.
   Sidewalks. A hearing of the Subcommittee International
Operations of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Back from
Moscow, Rep. Dan Mica, D-Fla., reported: ``Where the new building
is, (the Soviets) built us a 16-inch sidewalk so that there is no
place to walk. ... That is harassment.''
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Mass., asked if the State Department
pursued a ``reciprocity'' of harassment in building the Soviet
Embassy in Washington. She seemed to think it should.
   James E. Nolan, director of the Office of Foreign Missions,
replied: ``In the District of Columbia, one does not cut down
sidewalk size in half simply because the State Department thinks it
is a good time to do it or because we think that it is leverage to
do it.''
   Off site. Here was the real trouble. In Washington, Americans
poured concrete for the Soviet Embassy on site where the Soviets
could watch. In Moscow, Soviets poured concrete off site where
Americans couldn't, or didn't, watch.
   ``The Soviet Union works at the problem of security penetration
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,'' testified Schlesinger, who
investigated the embassy muddle for President Ronald Reagan. ``If
one signs an agreement that permits the Soviets to pre-cast columns
and beams off site, the principal party to blame is oneself. ... As
Napoleon once observed, there are limits to rascality, there are no
limits to stupidity.''
   The result, said the expert witness, was ``the best-bugged
building ever built.''
   It contained ``a full array of intelligence devices for which we
do not yet understand either the technology or underlying strategy.
... We failed to allow for the boldness, thoroughness and extent of
the penetration.''
   During the building of their embassy in Washington, the
suspicious Soviets watched every blow of the hammer. For every
American working, said an American official observer of the Soviet
observers, there was a Soviet watching.
   They X-rayed ``every inch'' of steel before it went up, said an
architect. They watched concrete poured on site. If the work went
too fast to watch carefully, they slowed the work. They insisted
that window units assembled off site be disassembled and
reassembled before their eyes.
   One result of their vigilance, the Soviets alleged, was the
discovery of pencil-thin microphones in the walls and bugging wires
in the weatherstripping of the windows put there by their American
hosts.
   Another result: The windows now leak.
   Both embassy complexes include a chancery or office building,
consulate, residential apartments, school, gym, swimming pool,
playground, theater und underground garages.
   The new Soviet compound is in a residential area of Washington.
The new U.S. Embassy in Moscow, like the old U.S. Embassy next
door, is surrounded by high-risers where it is assumed the KGB is
in constant attendance.

   Across the street is an old Russian church no longer used as
such. Among American intelligence people, who say the place is
loaded with electronic equipment for monitoring its neighbors, the
old church is now known as ``Our Lady of Telemetry.''
   Such was their mutual distrust, the superpowers needed 10 years
to agree on an exchange of sites to be used free of charge for 85
years. The United States got 11.9473 acres in Moscow. The U.S.S.R.
got 12.5258 acres in Washington.
   It took three more years to agree on ``conditions of
construction'' in two stages, each using local labor and materials
in stage one and each using a mutually agreed maximum number of
their own specialists imported for the second, or finishing stage.
   The original agreements stipulated simultaneous exchange of
sites, simultaneous completion of construction, simultaneous
occupancy of the chanceries. They also agreed to exchange
architects' drawings and each would have veto power over the other.
And, since the Soviet Union had no market economy on which to base
costs, they agreed that cost calculation for the Moscow
construction would be based on Washington prices.
   Congress originally appropriated $192 million for the whole
project. Now, says a State Department official, it will be asked to
come up with $270 million more for the new chancery. It will cost
that much because, to play safe, all the labor will have to be
brought in from the United States at American scale to build a
building free of Soviet ears.
   Time schedules meticulously negotiated by the superpowers bent
in the fluctuating heat of their Cold War and the numbing pace of
Soviet labor.
   It took two years to finish most of the embassy in Washington;
the Soviets moved into the residential and support quarters in
1979. It took seven years to complete the equivalent in Moscow, and
the Americans moved into those in 1986.
   All work had stopped. The United States had ``locked out'' all
Soviet employees the year before for building an office building
abounding in ``intentional defects.''
   The invisible presence in the woodwork should have surprised no
one. In Moscow, spying on visitors was older than borscht. The
czars kept informers busy, and their proletarian heirs bugged the
American embassy for years.
   So regularly that guests at Spasso House, the ambassador's
residence, were given cards welcoming and warning them:
   ``Every room is monitored by the KGB and all of the staff are
employees of the KGB. We believe the garden also may be monitored.
Your luggage may be searched two or three times a day. Nothing is
ever stolen and they hardly disturb things. ... If you have
anything sensitive to talk about, please call and make an
appointment with the ambassador to discuss it in his office.''
   The Soviets liked Ambassador W. Averill Harriman so much that
they gave him a handsome replica of the Great Seal of the United
States. It was years before the next ambassador found a tiny
microphone nestled in the carved wooden eagle.
   Americans have also found, they said, more than 40 mikes in the
walls of the old chancery, bugs in electronic typewriters, signs of
microwave assaults on the building, wires leading to a tunnel
between the embassy and a nearby Soviet apartment building, and
traces of a ``spy dust'' called nitrophenylpentadienal by which the
movements of people and objects could be tracked.
   Unintentional defects were equally hard on the psyche of
Americans trying to get a new embassy built in the land of Lenin.
Which brings us to a tale of bricks told with a lingering shudder
by Charles Bassett, chief architect.
   The plans called for the eight-story chancery to be faced in
brick. No problem, said the Soviets. Bassett quickly found
problems. Available Soviet bricks were rough and unattractive.
Lithuania looked promising but that didn't pan out. Likewise the
kilns of Western Europe.
   Finally, the right bricks were produced in Augusta, Ga., and
more than a million were carefully strapped and packaged on pallets
and shipped by boat to Helsinki and by train to Moscow, tenderly
chaperoned all the way by Americans. There, the Soviets had to be
stopped from ruining the bricks by heaving them into dump trucks
for delivery.
   Then, Bassett watched with horror as Soviet bricklayers went to
work using no strings or levels and setting bricks from inside a
wall on irregular lines. ``Among Soviet workers, meeting quotas was
all-important; it didn't matter if the wall fell down the next
day.''
   All work was stopped until master masons with proper tools could
be flown in from the United States to teach and supervise. And it
was stopped again with the discovery of the bugs, before the
building was closed in properly and the well-traveled bricks could
be protected from the weather.
   In their original negotiations in what seems like another age of
man, the two parties set up a cumbersome process to arbitrate
disputes. The United States has since claimed $29.9 million in
damages resulting from Soviet delays and defective work. It has
also given notice of intention to claim an undetermined amount for
``intentional defects.'' The U.S.S.R. struck back with damage
claims for $18 million resulting from U.S. delays. Settlement is
not just around the corner.
   Proving he was no imprudent country bumpkin, Uncle Sam took out
a $42 million policy with the Granite State Insurance Co. 20 years
ago. This was to insure the government ``against unforeseen and
sudden physical loss or damage during construction.''
   When last heard from, the State Department had collected $14,287
from Granite State to cover the theft of construction materials
from the construction site on Konyushkovskaya Ulitsa.
   Among the exclusionary clauses of the policy, the complex is not
insured against damage from defects, intentional or unintentional.
And should the United States embassy in Moscow be destroyed by
nuclear war, Granite State makes clear it will not pay.

   Once considered a miracle fiber, asbestos is now

   Kevin Quinn's father began working for
Consolidated Edison in the 1940s, when asbestos was still
considered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its use.
   William Quinn died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos.
   His son was hired by the same utility in 1979. In the years
since his father first came in contact with asbestos, numerous laws
had been passed to protect workers from what was now acknowledged
as a prime health risk.
   But in 1987, Quinn says, he was working at a plant when
asbestos-covered doors were removed from boilers and dropped to the
floor. The doors remained for weeks while workers went about their
duties without protective gear amid clouds of asbestos dust, he
says.
   ``I used to walk past that area every day,'' he says. ``They
told us it was safe. And it turns out it wasn't.''
   Now, Quinn has joined 180 co-workers and the Environmental
Protection Agency in suing Con Ed, charging that he was exposed to
the same material that killed his father.
   Eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulating
asbestos, thousands of workers _ at utilities like Con Ed, and in
other industries where asbestos was used as an insulator _ still
face its effects.
   ``We are talking to people who are extremely surprised that
asbestos is still a problem,'' said Heather Maurer, executive
director of Asbestos Victims of America. ``But the incidence of
asbestos disease is on the increase instead of the decrease,
despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use of
asbestos safer.''
   A recent union-sponsored screening of 538 Con Edison workers
found that 20 percent had either scarred lungs or mesothelioma, an
asbestos-caused cancer of the lining of the abdomen or the lungs.
   Since 1987, Con Ed has been cited by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration for more than a half-dozen alleged violations
_ mostly failure to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air
_ at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan, a plant in
Astoria, Queens, and at Quinn's 74th Street plant in Manhattan.
   Some allegations are still under investigation, some have been
contested and dropped by OSHA, and Con Ed settled others by paying
a fine.
   ``Prior to 1973, we didn't know what the asbestos risks were,''
said Con Ed spokeswoman Rosalie Zuckerman. ``We're not denying that
prior to that time, there was exposure. But now that we're aware of
it, whenever we do any asbestos work, we follow all the
regulations.''
   She added that since 1973, the company has had two medical vans
visiting Con Ed plants, carrying X-ray machines to test for
asbestos scarring.
   She would not comment on Kevin Quinn's suit. But Quinn says the
company was negligent in 1987, when he was exposed. The workers, he
says, were kept in the dark.
   ``We didn't realize we were working around asbestos 'til a shop
steward took an air sample to the White Lung Association,'' he said.
   Because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop,
workers like Quinn who believe they have been exposed recently may
not become sick until the year 2020. And people who were exposed to
asbestos in the 1950s, '60s and '70s are just now getting sick.
   A study by Dr. Irving Selikoff, perhaps the world's most noted
asbestos researcher, and his colleagues at the Mount Sinai School
of Medicine projects that asbestos cancer rates won't peak until
1992 and won't drop off significantly until after the year 2000.
   Smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer,
which is incurable in 70 to 95 percent of cases, said Dr. Stephen
Levin, who works with Selikoff. Mesothelioma is always fatal.
Asbestos exposure also increases the risk of colon cancer, which
has an 80 percent cure rate if caught early.
   The study predicts that 9,739 deaths from asbestos exposure will
be recorded in 1992 in just 11 industries, including utilities,
construction, car and railroad engine repair, shipbuilding, and
asbestos manufacturing.
   Many Con Ed workers fear they might surface among those
statistics:
   _Gene Duffy, 46, has worked for Con Edison for 25 years. His
chest X-rays show lung scarring; he often has trouble breathing.
Duffy said he can't even cut his lawn without taking a rest halfway
through to catch his breath.
   _Artie Sagevick, 58, a 31-year veteran. He gave up smoking 25
years ago, but he has ``coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a couple
of times a day.''
   _Says Steven Amato, a 21-year employee: ``If you had to do a
strenuous job, go up and down stairs, I could not do it. In the
wintertime, I throw the phlegm all day long. ... I'm 51 years old
and I feel like an old man.''
   All three want compensation from Con Ed, more help from their
union, and along with many of their co-workers, they are suing
asbestos manufacturers.
   Lawyer Chris Placitella is handling similar suits by 130 Con Ed
workers. His firm represents 3,300 additional workers from other
utility companies who are involved in similar suits, and the number
of plaintiffs rises daily.
   Con Edison has other asbestos-related worries. City officials
have raised concerns about public exposure to asbestos from Con Ed
accidents. In several recent incidents, asbestos insulation wrapped
around underground Con Ed steam pipes has blown off when the pipes
or nearby water mains burst.
   One explosion killed three people and contaminated Manhattan's
entire Gramercy Park neighborhood with asbestos, forcing hundreds
of people to relocate.
   Con Ed was faulted for failing to report the presence of
asbestos for several days, which delayed the cleanup and increased
health risks. Other accidents contaminated streets and subways.
   The city Department of Environmental Protection has called on
federal officials to come up with new techniques to deal with these
outdoor and underground emergencies, since the usual procedures
have not always applied.
   Most asbestos products will be taken off the U.S. market under a
three-stage EPA ban that begins in 1990 and ends in 1997. Advocates
for asbestos victims applaud the ban but wish more were being done.
   Asbestos manufacturers have filed a lawsuit challenging the ban,
claiming today's products are safe because the fiber is encased in
hard materials like cement and won't deteriorate.
   Whether or not the manufacturers are successful, AFL-CIO
occupational safety expert Peg Seminario predicts, ``It's going to
be some time before our asbestos problems are over.''

   They get most of their training in the slums and
ghettos of the inner cities, but officers of the Salvation Army
also must go to a special school for two years. It's a tough school
to enter and a tough school to stay in.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a century ago, Salvation Army founder
William Booth bade his charges, ``Go for souls and go for the
worst.'' From a brick campus on the edge of Atlanta, officer
candidates spend two years in classes and working in ghettos
preparing to carry out that order.
   The public image of the Salvation Army is that of a brass band,
the rattle of a tambourine and a blue-hooded woman on the corner
with a bell and an iron kettle.
   Less visible are the officer cadets, men and women in their blue
uniforms and sensible shoes, who some day will run one of America's
most least-understood churches. Yes, it is a church, a worldwide
one with more than 260,000 members in the United States alone.
   It costs the Salvation Army about $40,000 to put a cadet through
the training program, described by Maj. Phillip Needham, principal
of the Atlanta officer school, as a ``total immersion,'' heavy in
hands-on fieldwork, usually in Atlanta's inner city.
   The school, one of four in the country, has about 90 students.
The others are located in Chicago, a suburb of New York City and in
Ranch Palo Verdes in the Los Angeles area.
   Typically, Needham says, about half of the students who are
commissioned will stick with the work until mandatory retirement at
age 65. Most will start helping run smaller Salvation Army missions
or other programs and advance from there, probably in the South and
probably not in their home areas.
   Work will include organizing shelters for the homeless,
Christmas dinners and summer camps for poor kids, helping poor
families with rent and food money and, of course, spreading the
Word.
   Classes run the range from Bible study to social work to
computer programming. It's a tough school to enter, a tough one to
stay in. Many who make it are dropped, usually within five years of
graduation.
   ``Some can't set limits for themselves,'' Needham says.
``Care-givers want to help. They are oriented that way and some
people overextend themselves. They don't realize that they cannot
be all things to all people.''
   About two-thirds of the cadets are married, and both husband and
wife must be in the program.
   The average cadet here is 27, probably finished high school and
comes from a Salvation Army church in the 15 Southern states and
the District of Columbia that the Atlanta training school serves.
   Cadets live on campus and are not allowed to work during the two
years. They get a bare-bones budget for basic needs and can look
ahead to more of the same.
   An officer couple with more than 20 years in the program and two
teen-age children receive living quarters, a car and about $250 a
week. That may increase slightly with years of service, but not
with rank.
   ``There is no financial incentive,`` Needham says. ``We're
comfortable, but we don't have any money.''
   Needham and his wife, Keitha, both are fifth-generation
Salvation Army officers, and one of their children is interested in
signing on. Needham holds graduate degrees from Princeton and Emory
University's Candler School of Theology, but that much education is
rare.
   ``This is not primarily an educational institution,'' Needham
says. ``Educational institutions tend to create reactive modes,
with students regurgitating what the teacher tells them.
   ``We prefer to nurture pro-active leaders who find their own
talents and their own leadership abilities. Formal education is low
on our list. We seek out people with basic competencies.''
   The school insists on a 12th-grade reading capability, and
candidates undergo rigorous psychological testing and interviews
before being accepted.
   Minorities are encouraged, Needham says, and Hispanics,
especially, are heeding the call. Black enrollment has begun to
increase.
   Aside from Salvation Army officers, there are ``soldiers'' and
``adherents.'' Adherents, Needham says, consider the Salvation Army
to be their church but do not submit to the discipline.
   Soldiers and officers, for example, cannot use tobacco or
alcohol. Adherents can.
   Most of the training is done in slums and ghettos of inner
cities, much like the East London slums where the Salvation Army
was founded in 1865.
   Booth, Needham says, broke off from the Methodist Church to
create an evangelistic ministry that would inspire the working
class poor and get them into established churches.
   ``But the local churches didn't want them,'' he says. ``They
were smelly. They dressed shabbily. They couldn't afford pew
rental. So they went back and the Salvation Army became their
church. It adopted, and retains, a working-class culture.
   ``In Britain a brass band is a working man's orchestra; it's
tremendously popular.''
   The iron collection kettle originated in San Francisco about 100
years ago when the Salvation Army was collecting relief funds for
families of victims of a shipwreck.
   It worked.

   With public financing of higher education waning
and the pool of potential freshmen dwindling, college alumni
associations across the country are following the example set by
the University of Michigan, long known for its fund-raising
success.

<TEXT>
   Twice a year, 84-year-old Bert Wertman
makes the six-hour drive from his home in Buffalo, N.Y., to his
alma mater, the venerable, 172-year-old campus of the University of
Michigan.
   Wertman, who graduated in 1928 from the School of Business
Administration, returns to meet with other former directors of the
Alumni Association to discuss the university's future _ much of
which depends on alumni support.
   ``It's a continuous selling job to keep students interested
after they graduate,'' Wertman says. ``And I still do my part,
spreading the gospel of Michigan, as I call it.''
   Since graduating 61 years ago, Wertman has kept track of his 26
classmates of the Class of '28, bringing the remaining few together
for reunions and keeping them active in university affairs.
   It's his contribution to a vast network that tries to keep track
of some 330,000 alumni _ more than any other college or university
in the country, according to the New York City-based Council for
Aid to Education.
   In the last decade, as public financing of higher education has
decreased and the pool of potential freshman has shrunk,
state-funded colleges and universities have taken a lesson from
Michigan's long-established alumni programs, considered one of the
most successful in the country, even among its private counterparts.
   ``Our job is to cultivate alumni and keep them informed about
what's going on here and the challenges we're facing,'' says Robert
Forman, executive director of the Michigan Alumni Association for
25 years.
   That might involve an Alumni Association-sponsored African
safari _ one of 35 trips abroad this year _ a week at one of the
university's two family summer camps or a few courses at the Alumni
University, a summer school for past grads.
   Of course, the highlight for the second consecutive year is an
alumni trip to the Rose Bowl to root for the Big Ten football
champion Wolverines.
   The bottom line is that the better alumni feel, the more likely
they are to reach for their checkbooks.
   ``You used to find such professional programs only at your Yales
and Harvards, but in the last 10 years or so public institutions
have gone after and cultivated their alumni with a similar degree
of sophistication and success,'' says Paul Miller, vice president
of the Council for Aid to Education. ``It's gotten so now you can
phone in your credit card number to contribute.''
   Today's efforts to keep alumni interested in alma maters go
beyond newsletters, reunions and football telecast parties at local
alumni clubs. Some associations have turned increasingly service
oriented, selling members insurance, planning vacations and
sponsoring continuing education courses.
   The strategy seems to be working. Private support of colleges
and universities has nearly tripled in the last 10 years, says
Miller, whose organization tracks higher education fund raising.
   In 1987-88, alumni contributed about $2 billion to their alma
maters, up from $1.2 billion in 1982-83 and totaling 25 percent of
all voluntary support. At Michigan, about $22 million was raised by
alumni, not counting the corporate gifts that result from having an
alumnus on the board of directors _ or in the chief executive
officer's seat.
   But at Michigan and many other colleges, the Alumni Association
rarely asks members for money. That's the job of the university's
development office and its 17 individual colleges, which mail out
two or three requests a year.
   The Alumni Association works closely with the fund-raisers but
is an independent, self-supporting organization with 80,000
dues-paying members _ about one-quarter of all Michigan alumni.
   While fund raising and recruiting students remain the goals of
most alumni associations, many also are enlisting members in a host
of other activities, from advice on curricula and graduation
requirements to screening prospective students and providing
externships, in which students shadow alumni for a week or so to
learn about prospective careers.
   ``Those schools who use alumni as a source for money only are
missing the boat,'' Forman says.
   Some alumni clubs are even turning their efforts toward social
service projects within their respective communities, tutoring at
inner-city schools and volunteering at homeless shelters and soup
kitchens, says Sarah Hardesty, vice president of communications for
the Council for Advancement and Support of Education of Washington,
D.C.
   A University of Notre Dame alumni club in Washington, D.C., is
renovating apartments in a public housing project and a Duke
University club in the same city has adopted an inner-city
elementary school. Even small, private institutions are getting
into the act.
   More than 100 members of the Boston alumni club of Williams
College _ enrollment about 2,100 _ regularly volunteer at a food
bank.
   ``We still have happy hours, football telecast parties and golf
outings, but this is something we can get together and do for the
community,'' says Notre Dame grad Sheila McDaniel. ``And it makes
us feel good about where we went to school.''
   Still, reunions remain the mainstay of alumni contact. Michigan
holds about 75 class reunions each year. There are Michigan alumni
clubs in about 200 cities across the United States, as well as a
few in other countries. In 1971, the all-Michigan crew of Apollo 15
established the first extraterrestrial club when they planted a
Michigan flag on the moon.
   The list of famous Michigan alumni ranges from President Gerald
Ford and General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith to rock star
Madonna and the late Gilda Radner. It also includes John A.
DiBiaggio, president of Big Ten rival Michigan State University.
   Alumni associations aren't waiting until a student leaves the
campus to get him or her thinking like alumni. About 180 students
are involved in Michigan's Student Alumni Council. At Notre Dame,
the first thing a student sees when he comes to the South Bend,
Ind., campus is the mobile Alumni Association welcome wagon.
   ``From day one I felt at home at Michigan, and I've never lost
that feeling,'' says Virginia Nicklas, class of '49 and a former
director and vice president of the Alumni Association. She also
travels to Ann Arbor twice a year for the directors meeting from
her home in Pennsylvania, where she works in the development office
at the University of Pittsburgh.
   Though she received her graduate degree there, her commitment to
Michigan runs deep; she's always in the market for a new outfit in
the school's colors of maize and blue.
   ``It seems almost every place I've traveled in the world, I've
met U of M graduates, and right away, there's that common bond,''
says the former sorority sister, her blue `M' earrings dangling.

   Three ``Trekkies'' who began operating out of a
basement in Colorado have found there's money to be made in fan
magazines and movie memorabilia. They're cashing in on the
popularity of such TV and big screen hits as ``Star Trek,'' ``Star
Wars'' and ``Back to the Future.''

   Three high school buddies who started a
modest newsletter for fellow ``Star Trek'' fans a decade ago are
now managing a multimillion-dollar nationwide enterprise.
   Star Trek: The Official Fan Club is the creation of Dan Madsen,
John Davis and Robert Allan, who were drawn together by a common
fascination with anything to do with ``Star Trek,'' the television
series that inspired subsequent movies.
   The club, today just part of the men's enterprise called Fan
Clubs Inc., was inspired by the release of ``Star Trek: The Motion
Picture'' in 1979. Madsen, now president of Fan Clubs Inc. and
publisher of the club's magazines, began putting out a small,
photocopied newsletter for fellow ``Trekkies.''
   ``We ran the thing out of my basement,'' Madsen says. ``You
know, there were posters and all kinds of `Star Trek' stuff on the
walls.''
   Madsen began with 15 subscribers to his newsletter. Today,
35,000 people subscribe to the ``Star Trek'' fan magazine.
   Their club is licensed by Paramount Pictures as the only
official ``Star Trek'' fan club. Fan Clubs Inc. also operates fan
clubs for ``Back to the Future'' and Lucasfilms, the movie company
of George Lucas, producer of ``Star Wars'' and ``American
Graffiti.'' Headquarters is a nondescript building in an Aurora
business park.
   Allan estimates that fan club magazine sales will account for
about 50 percent of the $1 million the company will earn this year,
up from $400 in earnings just three years ago. He says that besides
the 35,000 subscribers to the ``Star Trek'' magazine, the company's
Lucasfilms magazine has about 15,000 readers. The inaugural issue
of the ``Back to the Future'' fan club magazine should have about
16,000 readers.
   The men have high hopes for the ``Back to the Future'' magazine
because of the release of the movie ``Back to the Future II'' over
the Thanksgiving weekend.
   The magazines are slick, four-color publications averaging 25
pages. They feature interviews with stars, letters to the editor,
behind-the-scenes looks at the technical wizardry and special
effects of the movies and a list of upcoming conventions and
events. They also contain order forms for merchandise and
classified advertisements for members who want to buy, sell, trade
and swap.
   Allan says the magazines boast impressive renewal rates.
   ``Big magazines like Time and Newsweek are happy if they get a
15 percent renewal rate,'' he said. ``Back when we had 5,000
subscribers, we had a 95 percent renewal rate. Now, with 60,000
subscribers, we have a 70 percent renewal rate. That's nothing to
laugh at.''
   The company also markets movie memorabilia, such as ``Star
Trek'' mugs and action figures and Indiana Jones fedoras.
Merchandise sales have shot up from nothing two years ago to about
$500,000 this year, the entrepreneurs say.
   Allan says fan club members include lawyers, 4-year-olds,
grandmothers and priests. Schools and libraries subscribe as well.
   The three men initially took some ribbing from friends and
relatives who were skeptical of the fan club's potential, but they
learned the necessary skills to make it a success.
   Madsen worked in a print shop, where he learned how to lay out
and design the newsletters. Davis got a college degree in English,
and Allan worked as a waiter to make ends meet.
   Soon after they began marketing merchandise in 1982, Paramount
Pictures contacted them.
   ``They were concerned at first because we were operating and
handling merchandise without a license,'' Madsen says. ``But they
saw our newsletter and they were fairly impressed. So we signed a
contract with them. They thought it had the right amount of
fanaticism and the right amount of professionalism they were
looking for.''
   Madsen, Davis and Allan have since traveled around the world to
meet and interview the stars of the movies and series they write
about. The license gives them exclusive rights to interviews and
photographs and allows them to sell officially licensed merchandise.
   The three admit that Aurora isn't exactly where one might expect
to find the official ``Star Trek'' fan club, but Davis says the
location makes sense.
   ``Well, we live here, for one thing,'' he said. ``And Denver is
one of the hottest markets for `Star Trek' in the country. We can
do just as good a job from Aurora as we could from California or
New York. We do a lot of phone interviews and travel when we have
to.''
   Allan says their respective interests may eventually take them
to new frontiers.
   ``We're looking at expanding into rock fan clubs and celebrity
fan clubs,'' he says.
   Madsen says there may still be other prospects on the horizon.
   ``We're looking at films,'' he says. ``John has considered
writing for movies or episodic television, and I've always thought
about being a director. We'd like to make our own movie
eventually.''
   Madsen says a genuine interest is what has made their efforts
successful.
   ``Everything we've done so far was because we were fans of it.
We're interested in what we're doing,'' he said.
   ``It isn't just a business.''

   Tall and powerful Craig T. Nelson seems right
for the role as the tough federal agent in the forthcoming NBC
miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story.''
   But Nelson is equally at home doing comedy. He's also currently
starring in the comedy series ``Coach,'' which ABC recently
returned to its hit Tuesday schedule. ``Coach'' had previously
aired in the spring and summer.
   In ``Coach,'' Nelson plays Hayden Fox, who at 45 clings to a
coaching job in a small college that a younger man would regard
only as a steppingstone. His old-fashioned ideas bring him into
conflict with the women in his life, a coed daughter he had not
seen in years, his longtime girlfriend and a new college president
who has some feminist ideas about sports.
   Curiously enough, Nelson began as a stand-up comic and comedy
writer-performer. But ``Coach'' is the first comedy he's done after
years of dramatic roles in feature motion pictures, frequently as
the heavy, and in such series as ``Chicago Story'' and ``Call To
Glory.''
   At one time, no producer would even consider him for a dramatic
role. In 1972, he got so discouraged he packed up his family and
moved into a log cabin with no electricity and no running water in
a wilderness area.
   After five years, he hitchhiked back to Los Angeles and found a
company willing to back a documentary series on people who drop out
of society. He tried to interest his former comedy partner, Barry
Levinson, in helping him edit the series.
   Instead, he found Levinson had just written a movie called
``...And Justice For All.'' Levinson asked him to audition for a
role and he was cast as the calculating prosecutor.
   Suddenly, Nelson became a much sought-after actor for movies and
television. After a time, people forgot he had done comedy.
   ``Drug Wars,'' which NBC will broadcast in three parts Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday, tells of the 1985 kidnap-murder of U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena in Guadalajara,
Mexico, and its aftermath. DEA agents believe Camarena was killed
with the knowledge of Mexican police and that a cover-up reached
the top levels of the Mexican government. The story is based on the
book ``Desperados'' by Elaine Shannon.
   ``I play James `Jaime' Kuykendall, the agent in charge of the
Guadalajara office, although the name is changed to Harley
Steinmetz,'' Nelson says. ``He's a big Texan, soft-spoken, with a
drawl. I talked with him several times because I needed to know how
he reacted during certain situations.
   ``He was reaching into areas that weren't accessible to him and
it was frustrating to him. In one scene he watches the police
question one of the men who interrogated Camarena after his
abduction. He goes berserk because the questions are so absurd.
Jaime confirmed that it was a very difficult time and some punches
were thrown.''
   Nelson's new show, ``Coach,'' began with a call from
producer-creator Barry Kemp.
   ``The idea of doing a comedy again really intrigued me,'' he
says. ``People no longer thought of me as a comedy actor. I liked
what Barry had in mind for the character. He's a guy in a midlife
crisis. He's not necessarily a nice guy. As a coach, he hasn't been
exposed to a lot of other values.
   ``One of the things I liked is they wanted to bring him to a
confrontation of his values and have him change through his
daughter and girlfriend. The ladies in his life have certain ideas
of how he should be adapting to what they bring him, but he doesn't
see it that way.''
   Nelson came to Los Angeles from Arizona in 1967 after he
received a scholarship to the Oxford Theater from the Eddie Cantor
Foundation.
   ``I had a baby and a wife and a car that was falling apart,'' he
says. ``I met Barry, who was also on a scholarship. He was living
in his car. It smelled like cologne and cigarettes. We teamed up
and did a comedy act at various clubs and trade fairs. It was a way
to get into the business, but at first I also had a job as a
security guard and later as a security analyst.''
   During that time they worked as writers and performers on a
Lohman and Barkley television variety series, ``The Tim Conway
Comedy Hour,'' an Alan King special and ``The John Byner Comedy
Hour.''
   Nelson has not written any ``Coach'' episodes, but says he has a
lot of input. He is writing ideas for movies and other stories.
   ``I'm doing right now exactly what I want to be doing,'' he says.

   In the middle of the musical ``Grand Hotel,'' a
young German baron suddenly declares his feelings for an older
woman, a ballerina making the last of her many ``farewell'' tours.
   He sings a passionate love song that soars from the stage and
over the audience. The singer is David Carroll, one of a new
generation of golden-voiced leading men making their mark on the
Broadway musical this season.
   Among the others are Gregg Edelman, who plays a writer of 1940s
detective novels, and James Naughton, who plays the writer's
fictional creation in ``City of Angels''; Bob Gunton, who shaves
beards and slits throats as the murderous barber in a revival of
``Sweeney Todd,'' and Cris Groenendaal, now starring in the
long-running but still sold-out ``Phantom of the Opera.'' In the
tradition of Alfred Drake, John Raitt, Richard Kiley and John
Cullum, these men are performers who can act as well as sing.
   Carroll ranks among the best of them. ``Love Can't Happen,'' his
big number in ``Grand Hotel,'' gets hearty applause. It's a
smashing musical moment in a show that celebrates movement over
music. Director and choreographer Tommy Tune never lets the story
stop in this adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel about the goings-on
in a luxury hotel in 1928 Berlin.
   And ``Grand Hotel'' may finally give the 39-year-old Carroll the
long Broadway run he deserves. It almost happened in 1988 when he
played the Russian grandmaster in ``Chess.'' The show had a
glorious score but a short life in New York, although Carroll got a
Tony nomination out of it.
   Most people remember ``Grand Hotel'' from the 1932 MGM movie,
not the novel. The film starred John Barrymore as the baron and
Greta Garbo as the ballerina, but the motion picture is not what is
on stage at Broadway's Martin Beck Theater.
   ``We're not doing the movie, especially where my part is
concerned,'' Carroll was saying the other day. ``The baron is
supposed to be much younger than the ballerina. In the book, it's
beautifully written when he sees her fragility and the wrinkles on
her face. That's what we're playing.
   ``I saw the movie on TV the other night, and Barrymore looked to
be in his 50s. And Garbo looked younger than he was. But they were
doing Louis B. Mayer's version.''
   Tune made sure everyone knew the novel. He gave everyone in the
cast a copy of it before they began rehearsals.
   Carroll has been with the show from its first workshop
production last year. The show rehearsed at the shabby Hotel
Diplomat near the theater district. The hotel's once-splendid
ballroom provided the right ambiance for rehearsals, and its
architecture even inspired Tony Walton's set design.
   Tune, the man behind such musical hits as ``The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas,'' ``Nine'' and ``My One and Only,'' reworked
the show extensively in Boston before bringing it to Broadway in
November.
   The book was revised, and Maury Yeston, the composer of
``Nine,'' edited and augmented the original score by Robert Wright
and George Forrest. It was Yeston who wrote ``When Love Comes'' for
the baron.
   ``This song came along and all of a sudden, it crystallized the
two characters,'' Carroll says. ``The ballerina finally said,
`You're young.' And the baron finally said, `I like older women.'
It hadn't been clear enough. I don't think the audience could tell
if I really like her or not. If I was trying to pull the wool over
her eyes that would have made me an unsympathetic character.''
   Carroll has been stage-struck forever.
   ``My parents had a lot of show albums,'' he says. ``As
newlyweds, they saw `South Pacific' on a fluke about 11 days after
it opened. It was played a lot around the house.''
   Growing up on Long Island and in Connecticut with two brothers
and two sisters, Carroll always sang. ``We played the records and
sang at the top of our lungs,'' he recalls. He also journeyed into
Manhattan to see musicals.
   ``I saw `Oliver!' from the balcony and loved it. Of course, I
wanted to be one of those kids right away. I went home and told my
parents I was going to the High School of the Performing Arts like
the kids on `Wonderama' and that was it. But it didn't quite work
out that way.''
   Dartmouth came first and detours into art and architecture.
   ``But I was spending so much time in the theater department that
I said, `Let's try it.'''
   Since he started to sing professionally in 1974, Carroll has
worked in all kinds of musicals.
   ``Fortunately, when I came to town I found a voice teacher who I
still have,'' he says. ``He taught me how to sing so I'll be able
to sing until I'm 60.''
   Carroll's resume is diverse. He has done a revival of ``Where's
Charley?'' and a revue called ``Rodgers and Hart,'' and he sang
opposite Linda Ronstadt in a pop, English-language version of ``La
Boheme.'' He has also had his share of short-lived shows such as
``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' ``Oh, Brother!'' and ``Wind in
the Willows.''
   ``I always liked doing musicals, but I didn't want to be some
stiff, musical comedy leading man who couldn't dance and couldn't
act,'' Carroll says. ``I like doing the whole thing.''
   He got to California with the national tour of ``Deathtrap,''
starring Brian Bedford. Los Angeles meant a lot of television
movies playing roles such as Valerie Bertinelli's husband or
Melissa Gilbert's boyfriend. But the parts weren't very challenging
and the directors not inspiring. He came back to New York in 1983
and hasn't left.
   ``I missed the theater and just realized I was more of a city
person,'' Carroll says. ``Besides, the driving drove me nuts. I'm
not a car person. I don't have one in the city now and get along
just fine _ as long as I can crank out eight performances a week.''

   The 1980s come to an end on a crashing wave of
change across the world: Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe and
is in convulsion in the Soviet Union. Chinese students shook
China's aging Communist establishment and while their democracy
movemement was crushed it is not dead. The Middle East saw an
uprising of Palestinians against Israel. The cauldron of Central
America boiled over. South Americans reeled in the throes of
economic crises brought on by mountains of debt. And so it went
across the world ...
   But what lies ahead for the new decade? In the following
stories, Associated Press correspondents in key areas of the world
look ahead to the decade of the 1990s.

   West Europeans are looking anxiously eastward as
they plunge ahead with elaborate plans for the 1990s in a climate
changing so quickly that answers are coming faster than questions.
   Their grand design is a ``single Europe'' of 12 Economic
Community members starting at the end of 1992, a melting away of
internal barriers and a blending of policies under the umbrella of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But after the Berlin Wall crumbled, and as a 44-year-old Iron
Curtain buckles, everything from the pace of integration to the
overall strategy has been thrown into doubt.
   Some Europeans suspect that against Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's image of a ``common European home,'' the smaller
``single Europe'' structure is a shaky house of cards.
   NATO is under mounting pressure to stand down in the face of
former enemies who are now acting like friends.
   The official view, stressed at a European Community summit at
Strasbourg in December, is that a united Western Europe is crucial
to helping Eastern Europe.
   EC leaders moved closer to a central bank, a common currency and
uniform social benefits. They also agreed to set up a Bank of
Europe to help newly democratic eastern neighbors.
   The EC called for a flexibility yet to be defined, and most of
its leaders applauded Washington's plans to support a stronger EC
and to broaden NATO into a political forum for solving problems.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, speaking on a visit
to Berlin in December, suggested a greater dialogue with the East,
not only on European problems but also to ease tensions elsewhere
in the world.
   ``As Europe changes, the instruments for Western cooperation
must adapt,'' he said. ``Working together, we must design and
gradually put into place a new architecture for a new era.''
   Whatever shape a new Europe takes, its leaders agree, the
cornerstone will be Germany. In many ways, the divided nation has
already united. Much hangs on how this union is formalized.
   Germany would grow from a reasonably sized EC partner to a
colossus of 80 million inhabitants with a gross national product of
$1.4 trillion, approaching the Soviet Union's.
   Without a separate East Germany, the Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact
military alliance is reduced to a few satellites that are fast
slipping away.
   Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher of West Germany insists
that a re-united Germany would demilitarize Europe and draw the
Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries closer to the EC.
   But President Francois Mitterrand of France maintains it is too
early to predict the direction Europe now will take.
   France clearly prefers separate Germanys while publicly
supporting the Germans' right to settle the issue themselves.
French leaders expect Moscow to block any formal reunification.
   Other EC partners, while encouraging the lightning-fast changes,
take a similar stance for varying reasons.
   Spain, Portugal and Greece fear investment and development funds
they counted on will be diverted to the East. Italy argues that
postwar borders should remain intact.
   Britain, which has resisted EC monetary and social integration,
may find an ally in a West Germany anxious to preserve some
independence within a single Europe.
   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, after an emergency summit
in November, made it plain that Britain was not anxious for a rapid
blurring of East-West lines in Germany.
   ``All military matters must continue to be conducted through
NATO and the Warsaw Pact,'' she said. ``At a time of great change,
it's necessary to keep the background of stability and security.''
   In West Germany, reunification is already a dominant issue in
general elections, still a year off.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has thrown open the door and encouraged
investment to speed unification. In Bonn, West German officials
already refer to ``the eastern part of the country.''
   If Kohl's center-right coalition stays in power, it will have a
mandate to push reunification. In such circumstances, Kohl is
likely to have reluctant support from Mitterrand, among others.
   In broad terms, Western Europe's mood is buoyant. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates put
growth at 2.7 percent for 1991, higher than in the United States.
   The Soviet Union would like a share of that prosperity. Some
officials say the Soviets now prefer trade to domination in Europe.
   On Dec. 18, the Soviet Union and the EC signed a 10-year trade
pact, opening the way for a larger Western role in a changing
Soviet economy.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze remarked: ``This is a
result of a gigantic effort made by the peoples of Europe to
overcome political and military confrontation, to overcome the
economic division of our continent.''
   In short, he said, ``the Cold War is over.''

   An aging, unpopular leadership, a faltering
economy and a restive population make for an uncertain and troubled
future as China enters the last decade of the 20th century.
   Pessimists hold the field as China emerges from one of the worst
of many bad years under Communist Party rule _ a year in which
troops gunned down young demonstrators in the streets of Beijing,
long-nurtured ties with the West collapsed and a decade of economic
reforms ground to a halt.
   China's goals for the end of the century, the quadrupling of
national income compared to 1980, the smooth reversion of Hong Kong
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and the triumphant staging of the
Olympic games in the year 2000, are all suspended in doubt.
   The key question is how long China can resist the storms of
change that have swept through the communist autocracies of the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Much depends on the health of the 85-year-old Deng Xiaoping, the
pragmatist who brought prosperity to millions of Chinese with his
market-oriented reforms but who also represents the old
revolutionaries using Stalinist repression to stifle popular
dissent.
   Deng's chosen successor is Jiang Zemin, 63, a relative unknown
who became head of the 48-million-member Communist Party in June
after reformist Zhao Ziyang was accused of supporting the
pro-democracy movement and purged from all his party posts.
   Jiang, the former Shanghai party boss, is believed to favor
economic reforms but, following the current line, has come across
as a hardliner since taking office. He needs time to develop his
weak political base and cultivate his political image, but if Deng,
believed to be in frail health, goes quickly, Jiang could face a
rapid ride into oblivion.
   His rivals for power are ideological conservatives such as
Premier Li Peng and octogenarian President Yang Shangkun.
   Their ascendancy would not mean a return to communes, backyard
steel mills and international isolation. But it would accelerate
the trend, already in progress, of re-emphasizing central planning,
stifling private initiative and retreating on economic and
political reforms.
   Their demand for unquestioning loyalty to the communist system
and Communist Party rule also would put them on what many Chinese
feel is an inevitable collision course with the forces of reform.
   The Tiananmen Square movement for a more democratic, open
society, crushed by the military, is quiescent but is certain to
re-emerge when the government lets down its guard. Events in
Eastern Europe have bolstered beliefs that the Chinese government
cannot forever resist popular demand for reform.
   Tiananmen also has clouded China's future relationship with Hong
Kong and complicated its long-term goal of reuniting with Taiwan,
the Nationalist island.
   China has promised not to touch Hong Kong's capitalist system
for 50 years after the British depart in 1997. But the nearly 6
million people of Hong Kong were badly shaken by the events of
June, setting off a wave of emigrations among the colony's most
talented people that is likely to continue until 1997.
   The rival Nationalist government on Taiwan in recent years has
eased restrictions on trade with and visits to the mainland,
raising China's hopes of eventual reunification. But Tiananmen
reinforced anti-Communist sentiments on the island and probably
strengthened the growing movement for Taiwanese independence.
   Internationally, China's relations with the West will remain at
a subnormal level as long as suppression of political dissent is an
issue. That could spell bad news for the nation's economic
planners, who badly need Western investment and technology to carry
out the modernization drive.
   ``The bloom is off the rose,'' said one Western economist, who
noted that Western businessmen will be inclined to spend their
money in more politically palatable places like Eastern Europe or
the Soviet Union.
   Investors are also concerned about the current government's
backsliding on reforms and moves to re-establish the primacy of
central planning, fixed pricing and party influence in the work
place.
   A retrenchment program, to continue at least until 1991, has had
some success in cooling an overheated economy and bringing down
inflation.
   But China is seen by outside experts as being unable to compete
with other rising economic powers such as Taiwan and South Korea
unless it pushes ahead with reforms, notably making prices
correspond to market value.
   Economists see a possibility of China becoming another
Yugoslavia, where high expectations for reform were followed by
poor follow-through and years of dismal performance.
   Beijing's leaders, trying to reassert state authority over the
economy, also are likely to run into a growing trend of
provincialism and regional rivalries fostered over the last decade
when local powers were delegated greater autonomy. There is a real
danger that the provinces, such as the prosperous southern China
area near Hong Kong, will increasingly defy orders from Beijing.
   China, with 1.1 billion people now, will have nearly 200 million
more mouths to feed in the year 2000 and must substantially improve
its stagnating agricultural output if it is to remain
self-sufficient.
   The nation faces other staggering problems:
   _Repayment of international debts of $44 billion reaches a peak
period in the early 1990s and the government will be hard pressed
to find the hard currency.
   _The education system is badly underfunded and little headway is
being made in reducing an illiteracy rate of 20 percent, more than
200 million people.
   _The average annual income is less than $300 a person, the urban
housing situation is abysmal and the welfare system surprisingly
inadequate for a socialist country. More than 20 percent of the
labor force is said to be surplus or redundant and little is being
done to prepare the nation for a serious unemployment problem.
   ``China in transition is a China that will be struggling to
resolve formidable contradictions,'' U.S. Ambassador James Lilley
said in a recent speech.
   ``It may be some years before we can put a name or theme to the
new chapter China will write in the 1990s. In the meantime, we must
be prepared for twists and turns that may defy attempts to label as
pragmatic or political, liberal or conservative, reform or
retrogressive.''

   Efforts to end the Arab-Israeli conflict
and other disputes in the Middle East are slow, but growing
superpower detente could nudge the region toward greater stability
in the 1990s.
   Iran-Iraq peace talks have stalled and both sides are rearming
amid a widening proliferation of long-range missiles in the region.
   This is eroding Israel's long-held technological superiority and
heightening superpower concern of a new arms race, including
nuclear and chemical weapons, in the volatile region.
   The pace of the Arab-Israeli peace process is unlikely to gather
momentum for some time, until Israel's right-wing prime minister,
Yitzhak Shamir, relaxes his hardline position of refusing to
negotiate with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Many observers believe this is unlikely unless there is intense
pressure from Washington. Shamir, at odds with a faction of his own
Likud Party as well as his Labor coalition partners, is in no
position to start making concessions.
   Egypt is expected to remain the crucial mediator between Israel,
with whom it signed a peace treaty in 1979, the Palestinians and
other Arab states in trying to reach a comprehensive Mideast peace
settlement.
   The current focal point of the peace process is a 10-point plan
produced by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, designed to break the
deadlock over Israel's blueprint for elections in the troubled
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, torn by a Palestinian uprising
for the last two years.
   The main stumbling block is the Israeli government's refusal to
negotiate with Palestinians they believe will speak for Arafat's
PLO.
   Arafat, backed by the Arab League, insists there can be no peace
conference not attended by the PLO, which Arabs acknowledge as the
Palestinians' sole representative.
   Despite Israeli claims the uprising is foundering, it shows no
sign of collapsing. The fear is that if there is no discernible
progress in the peace process, it will intensify.
   Analysts believe Arafat, after publicly renouncing terrorism and
recognizing Israel's right to exist, has gone as far down the road
to moderation as he can without alienating the PLO's hardliners.
   A year-old dialogue with the United States has failed to result
in Washington jarring any concessions from the Israelis. Failure to
produce substantive results will leave Arafat exposed and his peace
initiative discredited from within the PLO.
   Hardliners like George Habash of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine have made clear their patience is running
out.
   The Arab-Israeli peace process, which has dragged on for more
than 20 years with only Egypt's peace treaty to show for it, has a
profound impact on the region's other conflicts.
   This is most pronounced in Lebanon, the Middle East's proxy
battleground, where the Arab League was finally jolted into taking
forceful action to end 14 years of civil war.
   But the peace settlement it brokered has stalled because the
Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, rejects it, citing its failure
to provide cast-iron guarantees of a Syrian withdrawal.
   The Syrians, their efforts to pacify their unruly neighbor
thwarted yet again by Lebanese Christians, are becoming frustrated
and may yet move against Aoun.
   Radical Syria, which needs Lebanon as a security buffer between
itself and Israel, is likely to come under pressure from Moscow to
moderate its stand on the overall Middle East settlement as detente
improves.
   Moscow, increasingly crucial to the peace process after years of
being edged out by Washington, is already seeking to persuade Syria
to abandon its drive for military parity with Israel.
   The Kremlin, increasingly concerned with economic and social
upheaval at home, has made clear that Syria must end its rifts with
Iraq, Egypt and the PLO to achieve the long-elusive Arab unity that
is a prerequisite for an international peace conference.
   Iran, Syria's ostensible ally, also is in transition following
the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the election of
Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists, as
president last summer.
   He seeks to open up Iran after a decade of isolation, attract
Western investment and technology to revitalize the moribund
economy following the 1988 cease-fire in the 8-year war with Iraq.
   He is opposed by revolutionary hardliners and much will depend
on whether he can fend off the challenge and ease economic
hardships for Iran's 55 million population, growing at an alarming
3.5 percent a year.
   If he can, one key consequence could be the release of Western
hostages held by pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon and the removal
of a major source in instability in the region.

   At the dawn of a new decade, key Far East nations
are growing economically stronger, pulled along by the mighty Japan.
   Japan's economy is predicted to hum along at an annual growth
rate close to 5 percent, the best among the big industrial
democracies and the powerful engine helping other fast-growing
economies like South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore _ the
``Little Dragons.''
   The only real problem Japan faces as the 1990s begin is in the
political realm. The governing, pro-business Liberal Democratic
Party, beset by scandals and an unpopular tax, is heading for a
crucial election, most likely in February.
   The Japanese electorate will have a chance to pass judgment on
whether the cozy government-business relationship that has helped
make Japan rich is too corrupt to continue. The result is hard to
predict, though it seems likely that a political stalemate will
harden, doing nothing to change Japan's postwar reputation for
sterile politics.
   Japan and the Little Dragons harnessed well-educated, dedicated
work forces to the aim of exporting, with the huge U.S. market as
the target. Their success, however, has finally stung the American
giant into demanding reciprocal export markets.
   The old formula for economic success in the Far East thus is in
question, and countries are increasingly looking to each other as
markets. With Washington's backing and initial membership, a
conference of Asia-Pacific nations was held in Australia in 1989 to
improve economic coordination.
   Japan's overall trade surplus has declined but the troublesome
surplus with the United States seems stuck around $50 billion a
year. American demands for quality Japanese consumer products,
machinery and high-tech gear are unlikely to abate.
   Trade negotiators will be busy for the foreseeable future as
Washington seeks greater sales in Japan's market. The U.S. strategy
now is to change fundamental ways of doing business in Japan, and
U.S. officials can expect tough slogging.
   Traveling right behind the negotiators are businessmen from the
United States _ and many other countries _ seeking niches in
Japan's lucrative market.
   Other countries in the region will be similar targets of the
international businessman, and, like Japan, the explorer will find
in them vibrant local markets and complex political situations.
   Hong Kong, for instance: the British colony is to revert to
Chinese rule in 1997, and the question now is how many of the 5.6
million people will still be in Hong Kong then. The colony's morale
slumped in June when the Chinese army stamped out the pro-democracy
movement, and the future of Hong Kong depends on developments in
Beijing and London.
   China casts a shadow over other Far Eastern economies. It had
become a key source of cheap labor and land for businesses
searching for lower overhead costs. The stunning political
repression in Beijing set back many plans for investment in China.
   While South Korea and Taiwan moved forward with democratic
political reforms, the Philippines' young democracy took a heavy
shock in December with a bloody military coup attempt. The
mutineers probably shot as many holes in the country's chances for
strong economic growth as they shot in the high-rises of the Makati
district of Manila where the coup sputtered out.
   Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
are bidding to follow the region's other new economic powers.
Cambodia is in perpetual civil war and Vietnam is so poor that its
citizens are still fleeing almost 15 years after the Indochina War
ended.
   Vietnam, however, may be a new entry in the region's
economic-growth stakes if it is able to shed the pariah status it
earned by invading Cambodia.
   The Vietnamese occupation officially ended in September after 10
years, an indication of how long it can take to make a political
change in the region. Burma, for instance, remains stuck with an
authoritarian government.
   And North Korea's communist regime, still under the helmsmanship
of Kim Il Sung after 44 years, was not steering to East
European-style political changes as the decade ended. The leader's
son and possible successor, Kim Jong Il, said the North Korean
party ``must on no account admit heterogeneous ideas into it. In
party activity, the unity of action based on a single ideology can
be realized through monolithic leadership.''

   The idyllic South Pacific saw its first
coups, political violence and secessionist battles in the 1980s.
But in the decade ahead, the ``Century of the Pacific'' beckons and
the island states expect to have a small but assertive voice in the
world.
   Speaking in unison across a vast expanse of water will be the
voices of a new generation of post-colonial leaders with
intractible problems: malnutrition, fragile economies with scant
export prospects and urban unemployment brought on by villagers
flocking to towns with increased expectations.
   ``One of the continuing difficulties of the small island states
is that many will remain dependent on foreign aid, and in some
respects more in the past as they continue to grapple with these
problems,'' said an Australian government offiical.
   The decade of the 1980s saw unprecented turmoil in the region.
   Fiji had two racially inspired military coups. Civil lawlessness
in Papua New Guinea claimed more than 50 lives. The capitals of
Vanuatu and French Polynesia suffered destructive rioting.
Hostage-taking in New Caledonia triggered a bloody French assault.
   Added to that was a perceived Soviet military threat to the
region, concern about Moscow's growing economic inroads and anxiety
that Libya was making a foothold in an area better known for its
tranquility and palm-fringed lagoons than as a political hothouse.
   Covering 22 percent of the world's surface, the South Pacific is
home to 5 million people, excluding Australia and New Zealand.
   Environmental problems like depletion of the ozone layer over
Antarctica and the Earth's global warming has caused serious
concern in a region of low-lying atolls that could be swamped by
seas swollen by melting polar ice.
   The future of Antarctica is assured a big debate as countries
like Australia push for protected wilderness status against others
who view the world's last great wilderness as a minerals treasure
house.
   ``If for nothing else, that will happen because of the sheer
importance of Antarctica in regard to the world's weather
patterns,'' said the Australian official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Driftnet fishing _ the casting of huge nets over a large area of
the sea to scoop up tons of fish at once _ was a problem virtually
unheard of six months ago. But it moved into world forums after
island governments banded together to draw up an international
convention and propose United Nations resolutions that forced Japan
and Taiwan to scale down the practice.
   The 1980s gave birth to an anti-nuclear New Zealand and the
declaration of a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone adopted by 15
island states.
   ``They are increasingly becoming very effective in articulating
their point of view and building up cooperation among member
states,`` said the Australian official.
   ``It is a small, but growing voice helped by a new generation of
more assertive leaders.''
   Against that, he said, ``There are no new bonanzas looming that
are going to provide them with any riches.''
   The concept of the ``Century of the Pacific'' took a first,
tentative step in 1989 when 12 major Pacific Rim countries,
including the United States, met in Canberra, Australia, to plan
the future.
   They agreed to meet again in Singapore in early 1990 and
probably again in Bangkok, Thailand, later in the year to plan an
Asian-Pacific cooperative venture, an idea all agreed was one
``whose time has come.''
   The Canberra meeting brought together U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III with his counterparts from Japan, South Korea,
Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Brunei, Canada, and Indonesia. They represented 1.9
billion people and $280 billion in trans-Pacific trade, 50 percent
more than trans-Atlantic trade.
   The meeting was described by U.S. State Department officials as
the most important economic initiative in 50 years.

   Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Sri
Lanka _ a swath of turbulence through South Asia _ enter the 1990s
still trying to sort out their individual and overlapping destinies.
   Each of the four nations is on the threshhold of change,
teetering between the possibility for passable stability and the
specter of more chaos, political, military or both.
   The most dramatic conflagrations are the two wars anchoring each
end of this geographical arc that begins at Afghanistan and ends in
Sri Lanka off southern India.
   Afghanistan's civil war through the 1980s was a proxy
battlefield for the ideological war and balance of power between
the United States and the Soviet Union. With the Red Army's
withdrawal in early 1989, the superpower involvement is less overt
but not yet over.
   In contrast, Sri Lanka's tangle of ethnic and political killing
is one of those messy and obscure wars that have little bearing on
the affairs of other nations.
   For India and Pakistan, the coming decade offers a testing
ground for democracy and a chance to continue the thaw of
hostilities that took them to war three times in the past.
   In India's case, both the concept and practice of democracy have
been entrenched since independence from Britain in 1947.
   But the derailment of the Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in
November's elections has given Indians the opportunity to prove
their democracy has truly come of age.
   As new Prime Minister V.P. Singh contends with his implausible
coalition of Hindu right-wingers, secular centrists and
increasingly anachronistic communists, India will discover whether
it can find enduring leadership outside the Congress Party dynasty
of prime ministers that began with Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal
Nehru, and, except for brief hiccoughs, passed on to Gandhi's
mother, Indira Gandhi.
   In his first few days of office, Singh took encouraging steps
toward resolving the separatist Sikh revolt in Punjab and now must
capitalize on them.
   In Pakistan, which also became independent in 1947, when it was
carved out of British India to give Moslems a nation separate from
the Hindus, democracy has had a far more spasmodic and difficult
birth.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who attained office through the
ballot box in 1988 after the death of the coup-installed president,
Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, must tread carefully. Her government
supplanted 11 years of military rule but is still juggling an array
of threats.
   Moslem fundamentalists reject the very idea of a woman heading a
government. Less dogmatic politicians simply want their chance to
grasp power. And although the armed forces may have retreated from
the front lines of political office-holding, they are unwilling to
relinquish their not-so-behind-the-scenes power.
   Afghanistan's President Najib, the ex-secret police chief who
with Soviet backing muscled aside an even harsher Kremlin protege
in 1986, has proved an adept player of the Afghan game. But he is
only a survivor, not a victor. Ostensibly, his chief enemies are
the mujahedeen, the fractured alliance of Moslem guerrillas armed
by the United States and neighboring Pakistan.
   But Najib must also contend with the power-hungry opponents
within his own People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. As
Communist Party power delines in Eastern Europe so, too, could it
subside in Afghanistan, whose tribal society has never been fertile
ground for either Marxism or centralized government.
   The Soviets continue to supply and coach Najib's government,
while the United States continues to aid the mujahedeen, or Islamic
holy warriors, through its ally, Pakistan.
   India, the region's strongest military power, is still embroiled
in a border dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir. On the Indian side
of the contested frontier, increasingly violent Moslem militants
want Kashmir to join Pakistan or become independent.
   India also must re-assess the role of regional policeman it
eagerly embraced in the late 1980s when it sent troops to the
Maldives in the Indian Ocean to thwart a coup and to Sri Lanka to
try to halt internal strife between the Sinhalese majority and
Tamil minority.
   The Maldivian deployment was a success, but India had mixed
success as a peacemaker in Sri Lanka and is now pledging a speedy
end to its 2{-year military adventure.
   Indian intervention set in motion the long-overdue but still
incomplete formula to help Tamils wrest more political power from
the Sinhalese-controlled central government.
   But this foreign-inspired political pact, coupled with India's
bulldozer approach to peacekeeping, touched off even greater
violence by popping the cork on a bottle full of evil genies.
   Tamils and Sinhalese rarely fight each other any more. Instead,
Tamils are killing Tamils and Sinhalese are killing Sinhalese in
fights for dominance within each ethnic community.
   Still, the 1990s offer Sri Lanka the chance _ perhaps its last _
to climb out of anarchy before the skeleton of democracy succumbs
to the flames of war.

   Having struggled through ``a lost
decade'' of crushing debt and economic stagnation, South America
limps into the 1990s with the grim prospect of more tough times.
   Its many young democracies still fight to establish firm roots
in troubled societies, inherited in many cases from now-retired
military governments.
   At the same time, they face the daunting challenge of halting a
continental slide deeper into underdevelopment.
   The 1980s began with what is now generically known as ``the
crisis'' _ plunging prices for South America's products accompanied
by skyrocketing foreign debts.
   The decade ended with those debts approaching $300 billion
overall, with surreal inflation averaging nearly 1,000 percent a
year, with spreading poverty and with widespread social unrest. At
the close of the decade, per capita production was 8 percent less
than it was at the start.
   The troubles struck not only in countries with a tradition of
political and social commotion such as Peru and Argentina. Even
long-steady Venezuela was jolted by price riots in 1989. Colombia,
another economic and political stalwart, waged bloody war with a
billion-dollar cocaine underworld that was deeply entrenched in
several other South American countries.
   The experts see few signs of a better decade ahead.
   ``As far as perspectives for the 1990s, there is a certain
temptation to predict that the crisis will continue,'' said Gert
Rosenthal, director of the United Nation's Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean.
   In an interview in Santiago, Rosenthal said there were grounds
for pessimism in the inertia of Latin America's deep and
long-lasting recession, which has prompted him to call the 1980s
``a lost decade.''
   He said he also harbored ``the suspicion that the prolonged
expansion of world development can't last much longer, and any
recession in the international economy surely will hit Latin
America very hard.''
   In addition, he noted, there's little prospect of badly needed
fresh credit for the debtor countries trying to refinance loans
that drain the region each year of $30 billion, money that could be
put to use at home.
   Nonetheless, Rosenthal cited several positive developments that
could help in coping with the future.
   He said South America learned a hard lesson in the 1980s: Its
archaic economies, run by creaky state bureaucracies, must be
overhauled if it is to compete in the world marketplace. Also, he
said, both creditor banks and debtor countries were adopting
ever-more flexible positions on foreign debts.
   He also cited a certain ``revitalization'' of the old, battered
concept of Latin American cooperation and integration.
   The 1980s began with nine of the continent's 12 countries
controlled by authoritarian military governments. The decade ends
with elected leaders governing all but in Chile, where elections in
December set the stage for the first civilian government since 1973.
   Few of those new civilian governments have shown any success in
solving economic problems, but none has yet to fall. Indeed, while
particular governments have sometimes suffered from slumping
popular support, surveys indicate little inclination for the return
of military rule. Periodic uprisings at Argentine garrisons have
been quickly snuffed.
   ``Despite the entire decade's critical economic situation, it
appears clear that the democratic regimes are becoming consolidated
in the principal countries,'' said Jose Joaquin Brunner, director
of the independent Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences.
   ``There is no reason to believe the (democratic) processes will
be interrupted in the foreseeable future,'' Brunner said. ``Even
where the situation is most precarious, such as Peru, the
institutional machine keeps working despite everything.''
   The wave of democracy has produced a spirit of fellowship and
cooperation reflected in numerous summit meetings among South
American nations, involving as many as a half-dozen presidents.
Brunner said a new political and economic coherence is emerging.
   ``Everyone sees the need for relatively pragmatic programs,
aimed at economic restructuring,'' he said. ``No one is turning to
ideological alternatives. There is no South American wave in favor
of socialism, for instance.''
   In deeply indebted Brazil, a pro-business conservative, Fernando
Collor de Mello, edged out a socialist, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva,
in presidential elections Dec. 17.
   Brunner said deep ideological divisions and animosities that
often fractured South American societies are being erased.
   ``The range of possibilities has become so narrow, it's obliging
everyone to be pragmatic,'' he said.

   The Caribbean, which comprises some
of the world's poorest and most heavily indebted nations, faces the
prospect of increasing economic and social pressures in the 1990s.
   Problems confronting the two dozen island states south of
Florida range from rising unemployment and shrinking markets for
sugar and bananas to the spread of AIDS and drug trafficking.
   Some analysts believe the strain could be severe enough to
produce a resurgence of radical politics and civil unrest.
   ``There is just no way for stable democracy to continue in these
islands unless more jobs and income are generated,'' said John
Collins, adviser on the Caribbean for Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon
of Puerto Rico.
   While celebrating the 500th anniversary of Colombus' discovery
of the New World in 1992, the Caribbean will likely find itself
still coping with the effects of events dictated far from its
shores.
   Caribbean leaders have expressed concern, for example, that the
Cold War thaw could divert Western investment from their region to
the nations emerging from communist domination in Eastern Europe.
   Likewise, Cuba could be forced to reduce its economic dependence
on the Soviet bloc, said Norman Girvan of Jamaica, president of the
Association of Caribbean Economists.
   ``What's happening in Western Europe is changing our external
environment,'' he said. ``What's happening in Eastern Europe must
change the environment of Cuba.''
   For much of the region, one of the darkest clouds on the horizon
is the proposed single European market after 1992. A unified market
would lift trade barriers within the 12-nation European Economic
Community and harmonize foreign trade agreements.
   Among the nations most at risk are the Windward Islands of
Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, which together ship
240,000 tons of bananas a year to Britain. After 1992, they could
lose preferential access to the British market and face fierce
competition from more efficient banana producers elsewhere.
   Many also fear the loss of benefits as a result of the new
U.S.-Canadian trade accord and proposed changes in the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, the program set up by the Reagan administration
to promote U.S.-oriented economic and political development in the
Caribbean and Central America.
   ``The next decade is going to test the very theory that
microstates can survive in a world increasingly dominated by
massive trading blocs,'' said Larry Birns, director of the
Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs.
   Propects for the sugar industry, meanwhile, are dimmed by years
of sharply declining U.S. import quotas, low world prices and
increasing reliance on corn sweeteners and U.S. and European sugar
beets.
   Compton Bourne, professor of economics at the University of the
West Indies in Trinidad, said he thought pressure would build on
Caribbean governments to follow through on commitments to integrate
their economies and pool limited resources.
   But he said propects for the 1990s largely depended on the
willingness of developed nations to reduce the region's debt burden
and provide sorely needed investment.
   Analysts said the expected loss of revenue from traditional
exports would probably accelerate a move into tourism, already the
No. 1 earner of foreign exchange for several islands, and enhance
such industries as computer data entry that use cheap, semi-skilled
labor.
   Birns said there was a danger that environmental considerations
will be overwhelmed by the rush to exploit the islands' lucrative
tourism potential. Tourism is also regarded as a significant factor
in the rapid spread of AIDS, prostitution and drug use throughout
the Caribbean.
   Although conservative, pro-U.S. governments dominate the region,
Birns said, ``the approaching crisis'' could give rise to radically
leftist leadership and possible destabilization.
   If Western lending institutions such as the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank force further economic austerity
on such debt-ridden nations as Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad,
``you're going to see an increasingly dangerous situation,'' Birns
said.
   He added that the Caribbean of the 1990s would figure more
prominently in U.S. policy because of increased immigration and
closer scrutiny of the region's role as a major drug-trafficking
route and source of money-laundering through offshore banks.
   Haiti, the Caribbean's perennial trouble spot, approaches the
new decade at a political crossroads.
   Opinion is divided over whether Haiti's military leader, Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril, will fulfill his pledge to turn over power to a
civilian government in elections scheduled for the fall of 1990. No
one expects a swift solution to the country's profound economic
problems.

   Bedeviled by wars, corruption,
mismanagement and a burgeoning population, Africa is ending a
decade of economic decline and facing what some experts say could
be a ``nightmare scenario'' in the 1990s.
   The nightmare: increased hunger, disease, poverty and conflict
on a continent already desperately poor and largely unable to
survive on its own without huge doses of foreign aid.
   While warning of possible new violence elsewhere, many observers
predict an end to war in the coming decade in Mozambique, Ethiopia,
Sudan and other embattled African countries as combatants fight to
stalemate and exhaustion.
   Namibia ended the 1980s with an election for a constitutional
assembly and will enter the world of independent nations in the
coming year. Peace also seems close at hand in neighboring Angola.
White-ruled South Africa, which has long meddled in both those
countries, appears to be changing its racial policies, albeit too
slowly for some.
   But, with the exception of South Africa, the possibility of
greater stability in those countries will not automatically bring
prosperity to them or to the vast continent as a whole, say
economists for the World Bank and other institutions.
   The 46 countries of sub-Saharan Africa _ a region of 450 million
people that includes all of the continent's nations except Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and South Africa _ had a combined
gross domestic product in 1987 of about $135 billion.
   That was about the same as Belgium, with a population of only 10
million.
   That comparison, as well as any, illustrates the depths of
poverty from which most African nations are struggling to emerge,
only, in many cases, to slip deeper and deeperinto debt and
deprivation.
   The World Bank, in a study that took nearly three years to
complete and was released in late November, says there is a
solution for Africa _ one that depends largely on Africans
themselves and calls for a sharp reversal of past practices.
   The bank, a leading multinational lending institution, blames
many of Africa's problems on corruption, poor government marked by
bureaucratic bungling and misguided economic practices rooted in
Marxist-Leninist theory. All that, it said, must end.
   It was perhaps the bluntest assessment the bank has ever made of
any of the world's economies, but it may have been far easier and
faster to write than the suggested changes will be coming to a
continent whose rulers have too often equated power with plunder.
   The World Bank and others have also stressed the need for a
sharp reduction in Africa's birth rate. At 3.2 percent it is the
highest ever seen anywhere in the world and one that inexorably
accelerates pressures for land, food and jobs and threatens new
internal and cross-border conflicts.
   The population of sub-Saharan Africa in 1965 was only half the
450 million it is now and if current trends continue it will double
again to 1 billion in 20 years. The World Bank estimates that even
if fertility fell tomorrow to two children for each African family,
the continent's population would continue to grow for the next 60
to 70 years.
   ``No region of the world has ever managed to develop with so
high a rate of population growth,'' the bank said.
   Even in those countries where peace has arrived or is on the
horizon, it is likely to take most of the new decade to revive
their war-shattered economies, given optimum circumstances. Some
have fallen not just 10 years behind in the development process,
but 20 or 30.
   The World Bank's prescription for Africa called for increased
aid of about 4 percent a year through the 1990s from the developed
nations. But many African politicians and planners worry that the
East European countries emerging from behind the Iron Curtain _
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and possibly others _
will siphon off aid dollars as they attempt to restructure their
economies with Western help.
   As if those problems weren't enough, a new peril arose in the
1980s that threatens Africa in the coming years with a catastrophe
comparable to the droughts and famines that periodically sweep the
continent.
   It is AIDS.
   Health authorities estimate that 1.5 million to 2 million
Africans, mostly young adults, will die of AIDS in the 1990s,
draining even further the continent's already shallow pool of
skilled workers and forcing many countries to spend more scarce
money on medical services.

   It's a curious irony that the leading commercial filmmaker of
the cynical 1980s is a devout romantic.
   Throughout his career, Steven Spielberg has taken a sunshiny
view of the human situation. His heroes, notably Indiana Jones,
always triumph over insuperable odds. Life may hold its miseries,
as in ``The Color Purple,'' but the struggle is always worth it in
the long run. Even Spielberg's space visitors (``Close Encounters
of the Third Kind,'' ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'') prove benign.
   ``Always'' is Spielberg's most romantic film yet. The new movie
stems from his fondness for the happy-ending films of the 1940s,
especially ``A Guy Named Joe.'' That film provides the basis for
``Always,'' which is not likely to win the hearts of hardbitten
critics but should appeal to the millions who embraced ``Field of
Dreams'' early in 1989.
   In the new version, the air war of World War II has been
supplanted by the battle against devastating forest fires. The
sense of jeopardy is not the same, hence the dramatic tension is
diminished.
   Richard Dreyfuss is the hotshot pilot of the tanker bomber base,
taking risks that alarm his sweetheart, Holly Hunter, an air
controller. He believes he is invincible, but during a daring
rescue of his buddy, played by John Goodman, his plane explodes.
Dreyfuss finds himself on a grassy oasis amid a burned-out forest,
getting instructions from an angel _ Audrey Hepburn in a white
designer pantsuit.
   The guardian angel tells Dreyfuss his mission: to return to
Earth unseen and help Hunter overcome her grief and pass on his
flying prowess to another pilot. Enter Brad Johnson, a klutzy flier
who needs Dreyfuss' help but is handsome enough to sway Hunter's
heart.
   Spielberg lavishes all his craft on ``Always,'' and no director
makes better use of the camera. The fire scenes have a frightening
immediacy, and the flying is among the best in recent times.
   The fault lies in the script, credited to Jerry Belson and the
late Diane Thomas but seemingly the work of many hands. Consistency
of tone is lacking, and the plot has certain confusions, as though
important scenes had been cut.
   The cast performs admirably. Dreyfuss displays the solidity of
Spencer Tracy, who originated the role. Hunter is highly effective,
especially after she drops her down-home cuteness. Goodman neatly
fits his large frame into the Ward Bond-Alan Hale kinds of roles.
Johnson has the looks of a '40s screen idol and is likely to become
a star of the '90s.
   ``Always'' is a Universal-United Artists picture produced by
Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy. The rating is PG,
probably for mild swearing and excitement. Running time: 121
minutes.

   ``Forbidden Sun'' (Academy Entertainment. VHS-Beta, $79.95.
Rated R)
   
   Lauren Hutton plays a former Olympic athlete who runs a summer
school for girl gymnasts on the island of Crete. Among her pupils
is Jane, a juvenile delinquent who wants to emulate the ancients
Greeks and vault over the horns of a live bull. When one of the
girls is raped, Jane uses a variation of the ``bull dance'' to get
revenge.
   Uh huh, this film is as lame as it sounds.
   The suspense lasts about as long as a skip across the balance
beam. The payoff at the end is meager.
   Filled with references to arson, bulls, rape and young women,
``Forbidden Sun'' undoubtedly has some kind of psychosexual
subtext, but don't waste your time trying to find it.

   ``Great Balls of Fire'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated PG-13)
   
   Some of the best movie biographies are films such as ``Lawrence
of Arabia,'' ``Gandhi'' and ``Raging Bull,'' all carefully
researched and written and based on a variety of sources.
   And with such standard-bearers, why does Hollywood continue to
seek out books, usually best sellers, that give only a fragmented
(and sometimes biased) account of an event or life, and rush to
make movies of them? Are the creative minds of the film industry
incapable of doing original research and stories?
   These questions come to mind with ``Great Balls of Fire,'' Jim
McBride's movie on the life and times of the piano-pumping rocker
Jerry Lee Lewis, based on the book by Myra Lewis with Murray
Silver. McBride and Jack Baran did the screenplay.
   The movie is a kinetic romp through the early years of rock 'n'
roll, when Elvis was King and pretenders like Jerry Lee threatened
to topple him. The music is non-stop fun, whether songs by Presley
and Lewis, or Gene Autry singing ``Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer''
or Dave ``Baby'' Cortez stomping through ``Happy Organ.''
   Dennis Quaid is a treat as Lewis. He's manic, lewd, adorable and
crazy. He swaggers about with childish abandon, and dances with the
piano like a careless lover. At times, though, Quaid becomes almost
cartoonish in his portrayal. But that's OK, because Jerry Lee Lewis
was a walking comic book.
   Myra (Winona Ryder) was Jerry Lee's third wife. She also was his
third cousin and 13 years old when they married. He was 22.
   Ryder (``Heathers'') continues to impress with her film work.
She is a great casting choice for the pubescent, pulchritudinous
bubble gum-chewing Myra. She is wide-eyed and dreamy-eyed, giggly
and pouty, lusty and innocent.
   Their wedding scene is a wonderful slice of life. Ryder stares
blankly at the justice of the peace, mouth ajar like he's the
purple people eater. Later, at the dinner table with her parents,
she bursts into giggles knowing that she's married and they haven't
a clue.
   The year was 1958, and Lewis had already shot to the top of the
charts with ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' and ``Great Balls of
Fire.'' But his marriage to Myra shocked a staid post-war public,
and Lewis' career crumbled.
   The movie is centered on Myra and Jerry Lee's relationship (it
should have been titled ``Jerry and Myra'') and abruptly ends with
the birth of their son, Steve Allen, who drowned in a swimming pool
when he was 3.
   The late Trey Wilson co-stars as Sam Phillips, whose Sun Records
launched Presley and others.Alec Baldwin is deliciously
self-righteous as Lewis' cousin and boyhood buddy, TV evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart.
   ``Great Balls of Fire'' is a harmless piece of entertainment for
a Saturday afternoon. It's fun to watch, especially Quaid's
gymnastics and clownish grimaces.
   But the movie lacks authenticity; it seems to be laughing at
itself and at the era it purports to chronicle. There's also an
element of racism. A scene at a black nightspot, for example,
depicts black patrons as lewd animals doing bumps and grinds, and
crawling over each other in the most suggestive ways.

   ``Louder Than Love'' (A&amp;M) _ Soundgarden
   
   The future of heavy metal is here and its name is Soundgarden.
   On ``Louder Than Love,'' its debut album for a major label, the
Seattle-based quartet has stripped the genre down to its
bare-knuckled essentials _ loud guitar, shrieking vocals and
crashing drums. It's loud, but it is by no means just noise.
   The Parents Music Resource Center obviously broke out in a cold
sweat over the repetition of ``gonna kill your mother'' in the
cynical ``Hands All Over,'' hence the album's warning sticker. But
the PMRC didn't bother to read a little deeper into the lyrics,
which are really a commentary on the destruction of the
environment: The ``mother'' becomes Mother Earth.
   Soundgarden responds, though, when lead singer Chris Cornell
sings: ``Hands all over words I utter _ Change them into what you
want to _ Like balls of clay.''
   And yes, obscenities are chanted about a zillion times in ``Big
Dumb Sex,'' but that's the point _ the song is a wicked, Spinal
Tap-ish blast at all the big dumb sex songs floating around the
radio. It seems as if Soundgarden figured that everyone else beats
around the bush about sex in their songs, so we might as well say
exactly what our intentions are.
   On tracks such as ``Gun'' and ``Power Trip,'' the band points
out the problems that arise when power surfaces in violence and
exploitation.
   The biting ``I Awake'' looks at an abusive relationship from the
viewpoint of the abuser. Cornell sings: ``You have a good day _
It's not your fault _ I know it hurts.'' The real kicker comes in
the repeated line, ``Remember I love you.''
   Soundgarden follows the path blazed by Metallica and Jane's
Addiction in reminding listeners that we don't live in a pretty
world. It's a shame that their music, like that of Metallica and
Jane's Addiction, will probably make the radio waves.

   ``In the Land of Salvation and Sin'' (Elektra) _ The Georgia
Satellites
   
   Give the Georgia Satellites credit for candor _ they make no
attempt to camouflage their many influences.
   The liner notes for ``In the Land of Salvation and Sin'' salute,
among others, Hank Williams Jr., the Replacements and Tom Petty and
the Heartbreakers. The songs recall, among others, Steve Earle
(``Bottle O' Tears''), Lynyrd Skynyrd (``All Over But the Cryin''')
and the Rolling Stones (``Stellazine Blues'').
   There's nothing wrong with a few borrowed riffs when they're
well used, and ``Salvation and Sin'' is a solid set. It sounds like
a tight bar band on a good night.
   Lead songwriter Dan Baird, while not terribly original,
nonetheless has talent. His two ballads, ``Another Chance'' and
``Sweet Blue Midnight,'' are particularly appealing. The former is
about growing older (``Don't want to die asking for another
chance''); the latter, with Nicolette Larson providing lovely
harmony vocals, concerns the search for comfort amid life's
uncertainties.
   Most of Baird's uptempo tunes work, too, with drummer Mauro
Magellan and bassist Rick Price usually able to find a groove.
   The Georgia Satellites' potential likely is limited because of
Baird's singing and Rick Richards' slide guitar _ both are
nondescript performers. But Baird's songwriting and the band's
ability to distill their diverse influences make ``Salvation and
Sin'' worth a listen.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Jessica Lange Meets Costa-Gavras</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``The Music Box'' opened in New York and Los Angeles on Dec.
22.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The combination of a volatile star and a
director of international renown might seem potentially explosive.
But Jessica Lange and Constantin Costa-Gavras claim the expected
fireworks didn't happen in their collaboration on ``Music Box.''
   After her disastrous debut in ``King Kong,'' Lange began taking
charge of her career. She has reportedly clashed with directors
over interpretations of her film roles and has developed and
produced her own projects, such as ``Country.''
   Costa-Gavras is known as the uncompromising, Greek-born director
of such politically-themed films as ``Z,'' ``Missing'' and
``Betrayed.'' ``Music Box'' deals with guilt from the Holocaust.
   ``I had input as far as the development of the character,'' says
the actress, who plays a Chicago lawyer defending her father
against charges he murdered Jews in his native Hungary.
   ``I wasn't involved at a production level. I had such respect
and confidence in Costa that I didn't feel the need to get in there
and make my opinions known. I agreed with what he was doing, which
made the filmmaking much easier for me. It's difficult when you're
not in agreement with how the film is being made. You have to
expend a lot of energy arguing or opposing the way things are
happening.
   ``In this case, everybody was in sync. But it's rare.''
   ``She is strong, and extremely nice,'' Costa-Gavras said about
his star. ``It was a big pleasure, because the relationship
(developed) little by little, getting very close as we spoke about
the character in a very intimate way. I think it was quite a unique
experience to me. She looks a little distant, but she's absolutely
not.''
   In one of her infrequent interviews, Lange was asked if she
encountered any resentment because a star insisted on making her
opinions known.
   She laughed and replied, ``I suppose there was some of that. I'm
certainly not the first person to do that, and I won't be the last.
Sometimes you're just an actress for hire: You go in and do your
part and that's it. At other times your commitment is deeper than
that.''
   Lange approached her ``Music Box'' role with her usual
thoroughness, hanging out in courtrooms and reading endless legal
briefs. ``Ultimately, you can observe behavior,'' she said, ``but
when you get down to playing it, it all has to come from the
character.
   ``But I learned a lot about legal proceedings. It's a very
tricky business. ... One thing I learned about law is that it's not
synonymous with truth. They do not exist side-by-side, which is too
bad, because originally I think that's what it was meant to be. Now
so much of it is rhetoric, tricks and manipulation.''
   The 40-year-old Lange reigns as one of the five most-in-demand
film actresses, a position no one would have predicted 10 years
ago. After repeating the Fay Wray role in ``King Kong,'' she didn't
work for two years. Finally, Bob Fosse gave her a small part as an
angel in ``All That Jazz.'' Although the remake of ``The Postman
Always Rings Twice'' with Jack Nicholson was a failure, Lange was
impressive as a dramatic actress.
   That promise was fulfilled in ``Tootsie,'' ``Frances,'' ``Sweet
Dreams'' and ``Country,'' all resulting in Academy nominations. She
won the 1982 Oscar as supporting actress for ``Tootsie.''
   Her acting dreams began as a child in rural Minnesota, where she
fell in love with ``Gone With the Wind'' and played Melanie's death
scene with every sickness.
   ``From the time I was 9, I was obsessed with `Gone With the
Wind,''' she confessed. ``It was an obsession that lasted until I
saw the French film, `Children of Paradise.' Then my obsession
switched. These two films got me through childhood and adolescence,
all the way up into my 20s.''
   Lange is intensely private, but she has provided the gossip
writers with plenty of copy. Her liaison with dancer Mikhail
Baryshnikov produced a daughter, Alexandra, 7. She and
playwright-actor Sam Shepard are parents of Hannah Jane, born in
1986, and Samuel Walker Shepard, born in 1987. She and Shepard, who
are not married, make their home in rural Virginia.
   ``The farm is great, but every once in a while you want the
bright lights, big city,'' she remarked. ``The trick is to find an
equilibrium.''
   ``Music Box'' was partly filmed in Hungary before the recent
political upheavals.
   ``You could feel there was something in the air when we were
there in the spring,'' the actress said. ``There was definitely a
change beginning to happen; you could tell from the spirit of the
people. I had never been to an Eastern bloc country before, so it
was real interesting to me. I was real relieved to get home,
though.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Santa Fe Folk Art Will Become Enduring Classic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED MORENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real adobe bricks and mud are rarely used
these days to build houses, and even the supply of real cornhusks
to wrap homemade tamales is drying up.
   Nowadays, plaster stucco gives that adobe look and restaurants
wrap tamales in paper. Even popular forms of folk art, such as the
ubiquitous howling coyote, are mass-produced in China.
   It has become increasingly difficult to distinguish authentic
Santa Fe art from imitation. But rather than diluting the genre,
those who help define Santa Fe style believe New Mexico's unique
amalgamation of Indian, Hispanic and Anglo-European cultures will
sustain its popularity long after the fad has faded.
   ``People talk about the fad aspect, but the fact remains that
Santa Fe style is rooted in centuries of human history,'' says
Christine Mather, co-author of the book, ``Santa Fe Style.''
   That's good news for the thousands who came this Christmas
season in search of a wreath of red chili peppers, a classy poster
from a famous Southwestern or Indian artist or simply to experience
Christmas Eve singing Christmas carols around a pinon bonfire on
Delgado Street.
   It means that Santa Fe style, its architecture, simplicity and
warmth, will never go completely out of style.
   ``I don't think it will ever die,'' says Joan Cawley, an art
wholesaler with a gallery on fashionable San Francisco Street.
   If anything, its popularity is expanding. With sales of more
than 100,000 copies, Mather's book has helped put Santa Fe style
into the American vernacular. Ellen Bradbury, who operates a Santa
Fe tour service, says this Christmas season seems busier than ever.
Cawley's art business is growing on every continent.
   The style emerged from the traditions, practices and
architecture of the Pueblo Indians, with their heavy, asymmetrical,
multi-story homes, and the Spanish, who brought European religious
traditions to New Mexico in the 1500s.
   Popularized by a colony of artists in the 1920s and '30s, Santa
Fe culture is reflected in simple, comfortable clothing, turquoise
and silver jewelry and honest, spicy cuisine, along with an
affinity for dirt streets, tolerance of the eccentric, appreciation
of a stunning blue sky and, in some quarters, almost paranoid
defense of the fine and folk arts.
   The most enduring features of the Santa Fe look will be its
building styles, which some experts believe will join the gallery
of classic historic and architectural styles such as colonial
American, Victorian and Old South.
   The decision to copy California mission style and establish and
foster a Santa Fe architectural movement was made early in the
1900s when it became apparent that the city, relegated to the end
of a spur off the Santa Fe Railroad main line, would never again be
a major trading center.
   Community leaders adopted what architectural historian Boyd
Pratt calls Spanish pueblo revival style, and passed the city's
first historic styles ordinance, which has remained relatively
intact.
   Its characteristics are typified by the heavy, low-profile
Palace of the Governors and the state Museum of Fine Arts facing
the central plaza, renovated soon after statehood in 1912.
   The latest wave of Santa Fe popularity began more than a decade
ago, at about the same time northern New Mexico artisans began
producing small, carved animal figures, including howling coyotes.
   The coyote has mythical meaning to many Indian tribes, sometimes
creator and benefactor, often mischief-maker and destroyer. More
than that, it has a distinctive image that is simple, decorative
and affordable, says gallery owner Davis Mather.
   Mather, husband of the author, began featuring the carvings of
several local artisans in 1978. Now the work of Felipe Archuleta
and a half-dozen others resides in museum collections. On display
at Mather's gallery is the next fad: carved, wooden, painted,
wall-hanging snakes.
   The carved coyotes, snakes and their knock-offs and
reproductions on T-shirts, pottery and canvas are not universally
popular among some Santa Fe residents who say they trivialize the
value of their town.
   ``It's stupid. There are coyotes everywhere,'' says artist Corri
Merritt. ``Somebody said it would peak next month, but I doubt it.''
   Cartoonist Jerry Milord has lampooned the excesses and
capitalized on the local pique with a colorful hit poster entitled
``Another Victim of Santa Fe Style.''
   The poster is set in a classic, Santa Fe-style room, with beamed
ceilings, a kiva or beehive fireplace with stucco benches and a
niche with a small santo (wooden figure representing a saint)
inside. Against the walls are a carved wooden trastero (hutch), a
chili ristra, a buffalo skull and carved, painted snakes against
the walls. A howling coyote and leather drum rest on the Mexican
tile floor.
   A woman, lying supine on a woven Navajo rug, is decked out in
turquoise squash blossom necklaces and silver concha belts, wearing
a velvet shirt and pleated skirt and cowboy boots. A painted snake,
which appears to have wriggled off the wall and bitten its owner,
slithers out the door.
   ``The people who buy them are, like, laughing at themselves,''
says Milord. ``It's not a mean thing.''
   An old, classy town such as Santa Fe, which has withstood
conquests, revolts, reconquests and immigration of all varieties,
may see the coyote fade from popularity, knowing it will likely
return.
   Twenty to 30 years from now, Mather predicts, a clever Santa
Fean will dig into his trunk and emerge with paper napkins
emblazoned with a bandana-scarfed coyote, its mouth pointed upward
howling at the moon.
   It will begin yet another revival _ of Santa Fe kitsch.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Let's Sing the Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sting did it. Linda Ronstadt did it. Even Marvin
Gaye and Lou Reed did it. So, Melissa Manchester reasoned, let's do
it, let's sing standards.
   ``This music has been out in the universe for decades,'' said
Manchester, whose first album in four years, ``Tribute,'' includes
``Stardust,'' ``Over the Rainbow'' and other lushly produced songs
from the pre-rock 'n' roll era.
   ``These are magnificent melodies and long, intricate stories. To
wrap your voice around them makes you want to rise to the occasion
of these songs. It's different than singing short bits of rock 'n'
roll phrases, which I find more difficult.''
   In 1985, Manchester had had enough. A dozen years of making
records had erased the thrill. There were children to raise, an
interest in theater to pursue. It seemed a good time to finish the
career that took off in 1975 with the ballad ``Midnight Blue.''
   But this show business veteran, once a backup singer for Bette
Midler, has seen how tentative ``retirements'' usually are. A few
years away and Manchester got the urge to belt 'em out again. Not
new material, however, old material.
   ``When I gained distance and perspective from the music
industry, it came to me as to what I was really up to doing,'' she
said. ``Once I became clear it was the right thing to do and it was
basically in my truth, all the details fell into place.''
   Having grown up on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the 38-year-old
Manchester was drawn to sophisticated ladies of jazz such as Billie
Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald and the polished compositions of Hoagy
Carmichael and George Gershwin. She knew, however, that it was best
to step lightly into shoes so large.
   ``I felt I was ready and had grown enough to pay tribute to
these women who were heroines in my youth,'' she explained. ``It
was not at all about competing with these women _ that would be
folly. It was simply to acknowledge their greatness, and the
greatness of their songs.''
   So Manchester wasn't looking to ``cover'' the songs, just polish
them up a little. On ``Over the Rainbow,'' she wrestled with the
memory of Judy Garland's anguished performance at Carnegie Hall in
1961, a sad departure from the innocence of the ``The Wizard of
Oz.''
   ``To this day, it's riveting and gut-wrenching and a testimonial
to her experience,'' Manchester said.
   ``I'm bringing my own experience and I see it as an anthem-like,
optimistic song. There is an inner life to songs, particularly if
you have signature songs that you're going to have to sing all your
life. It's interesting how your life affects a song you're
singing.''
   Young singers wishing to pay tribute to Manchester might skip
the 1982 Grammy winner, ``You Should Hear How She Talks About
You,'' and go back to ``Midnight Blue,'' which Manchester co-wrote
with Carole Bayer Sager.
   They wanted Dionne Warwick to sing it, but producer Vini Poncia
was so impressed with the demo that he used Manchester instead.
``Midnight Blue'' peaked on the charts at No. 6.
   ``I was really unconscious in those days. `We're on the charts?'
`What does that mean?' `Are we all suppose to do something, open a
bottle of champagne?' I was very young and I had no sense of
packaging. I just wanted to write and sing. I didn't care what I
looked like, that I looked a mess or not.''
   ``Talks About You,'' with its snappy, updated ``girl group''
sound, wasn't her idea, Manchester insists. By then, her career
needed a boost and she agreed to take chances with a slicker, more
aggressive sound. It worked, but at a price.
   ``The risk is you shave off a little slice of your soul. I was
shaving more and more pieces and in real danger of giving the whole
thing away. My soul was too important to me. Stevie Wonder wrote,
`Where is my spirit, I'm nowhere near it.'''
   Fourteen years after ``Midnight Blue,'' Manchester is still
thinking about Warwick, capping her tribute record with the hit
``Walk on By,'' which first came out in 1964.
   ``I was always touched by `Walk on By.' It was always this very
traumatic and dark and moody song about what's not said in a
relationship. I wanted to produce the record to be deeper and more
spacious and more dramatic.''
   And when it was time to make a video, Manchester resisted a
straight romantic interpretation, transferring one of today's
issues onto one of yesterday's hits.
   ``I thought of the title, `Walk on By.' The description of what
we did in society when we pass images that are disquieting, such as
homelessness,'' she said.
   ``I came up with this idea of playing a homeless woman with two
children and having to leave the two children at the shelter. We in
fact filmed at a shelter in Los Angeles and I got to speak to
several of the women there. It semed like a good idea and turned
into a real educational experience.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Mordecai Richler's Most Ambitious Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mordecai Richler has a standard answer ready for
those who wonder about the apparent similarities between the
fictional Gursky family in his new novel and a certain real-life
Canadian dynasty that soared to wealth and prominence in the
whiskey business.
   ``My reply will be that I wouldn't want five years' work reduced
to the level of prurient gossip,'' he says.
   Indeed, Richler closes the lively new book, ``Solomon Gursky Was
Here,'' with an author's note that simply states: ``I made the
Gurskys up out of my own head.''
   The Montreal-based writer is frequently repeating his answer on
the promotional tour that is helping to make the novel, his first
since ``Joshua Then and Now'' in 1980, one of the big books of the
Canadian fall publishing season. It will appear next spring in the
United States and a short while later in Britain.
   ``I think there are two or three superficial resemblances in
their early careers, but it's not about that family at all,''
Richler, 58, said of the Bronfman family, who built Seagram's into
the world's largest distilling company.
   He noted that the novel not only includes those ``superficial
resemblances'' to the Bronfmans in Montreal but also ranges over
Canadian territory from the Prairies to the Arctic and covers
subjects from anti-Semitism to the search for the Northwest Passage.
   ``You write a novel, and it's very difficult to follow it around
with explanations,'' Richler said. ``I feel I've had my say.''
   The atmosphere of Montreal's prominent Jewish community has
served Richler well in his past novels, such as ``The
Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'' and ``St. Urbain's Horsemen.''
   ``It's certainly the most complex novel I've ever attempted,''
Richler said of his new work. He was interviewed, looking slightly
rumpled and smoking small Dutch cigars, at breakfast during his
visit to Toronto for an authors' festival.
   ``It's his longest novel yet, and by far his most ambitious and
imaginative,'' reviewer William French wrote in Toronto's Globe and
Mail newspaper. ``Whether it's his most satisfying is open to
debate.''
   Richler works regularly as a journalist and is one of the
Canadian writers turned to frequently by foreign publications
seeking a home-grown view of the country.
   He has been working lately on an article about the
English-French language tensions in Quebec. The province's English
minority lives for the most part in Montreal, the largest city in
Quebec.
   ``It's a quarrel more appropriate to a schoolyard. Whichever
side you're on, it's somewhat embarrassing to be quarreling about
signs,'' Richler said.
   Quebec provincial laws restrict the language on all outdoor
commercial signs to French.
   ``It's a very wasting tribal quarrel. It has little to do with
the real problems of the country,'' he said.
   During the hard-fought 1988 campaign over whether Canada should
go ahead with a free-trade agreement with the United States, he
lined up not with such writing heavyweights as Robertson Davies and
Margaret Atwood against the pact but with a lesser known group
supporting it.
   ``I just felt that it was a trade deal,'' Richler said. ``I hope
it will work out well. The test will be if it creates more jobs.''
   The opponents of the pact, which took effect last Jan. 1, argued
that Canadian culture could be overwhelmed if trade barriers were
lowered with the United States.
   ``I thought there was a certain amount of hysteria,'' Richler
said. ``I don't think the free trade deal is going to destroy the
CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.) or Canadian publishing; if I
thought so, I would be against it.''
   Richler sees an ironic touch to his having taken positions that
made him anathema to hard-core Canadian nationalists and his now
having written ``a resoundingly Canadian novel.''
   He said his publishers seem to believe the material will be
considered exotic elsewhere and not be harmed by readers' lack of
knowledge about Canada. ``They think it's a very commercial
novel,'' he said.
   Richler lived in Europe, mostly in London, for two decades,
returning to his native Montreal in 1972.
   He also has worked as a screenwriter, including the screenplay
for ``The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,'' and written two
well-received children's books.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Jeff Brock's Music Is All Over Television</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeff Brock has never recorded a hit
song, but people who watch TV frequently hear his music.
   The 39-year-old Brock is president of a ``music house,'' a
company that provides tunes for TV commercials. Brock Music, his
company, has won or shared five Clios or ADDYs, national awards for
excellence in advertising.
   Some of his best-known music accompanied these spots:
   _ Actor Richard Farnsworth posing in a desert eating chips with
the tag line, ``the flavor's a legend.''
   _ Fast-food hamburger containers open their lids and talk to
each other.
   _ A bleach with the hook line, ``Don't just get 'em clean, get
'em vivid.''
   Brock provides music to advertising agencies that have contracts
with major corporations. He comes up with original music or
arranges a well-known song that already has been chosen for an ad.
   Brock, who supervises a staff of four plus several free-lance
music writers and arrangers, says music is important to the overall
content.
   ``I think music plays an immense role in the memorability of a
spot. When you have 5-year-old kids running around singing jingles
all day, you know it has a lot of impact on people's minds,'' he
said.
   He estimates that 70 percent of his work is ``post scores'' _
seeing the ad without music and writing a tune to emphasize what's
happening visually.
   ``The music is supposed to be poignant and jump out,'' Brock
said.
   The guidelines vary.
   ``They will say they want something appealing to kids age 12 to
young adults age 25. In that age group, you go for something hard
hitting, something a little more rock 'n' roll.
   ``Sometimes they say they want music like ... and they name the
artist. I come up with something similar to that artist or that
style,'' he said.
   ``Sometimes we go out on a limb and say we don't think it will
work and here's what we suggest.
   ``And in other cases, they say they have no earthly idea what
they want. But they know it when they hear it. Those are the
toughies. You may come up with something you think is incredibly
good, but the client doesn't.''
   For a recent spot about food to be taken to work, he was
instructed to come up with music that sounded ``classical, English,
very proper.''
   ``When I wrote those scores, I wrote from an acoustical
standpoint with strings and woodwinds and light, fun,
British-sounding music. It came out beautifully and they are airing
nationally.''
   He writes some lyrics, but most of the time they are written by
the ad agency. ``We sort of pick up the ball and run with it
wherever they decide to pass it off to us,'' Brock said.
   He always knows the client, but sometimes it is top secret.
   ``We're not supposed to let out what we're doing or the
campaign, and this can be painful because you've just done a
wonderful session for someone and they are not going to break the
campaign for three months and you can't even play it for anybody.''
   In most cases, the spots are 30 seconds long, some only 15
seconds.
   ``You don't get a chance to say much in 15 seconds,'' he said.
   The companies and products he has worked with include General
Mills, Century 21, K mart, the Walt Disney Co., CBS News, Folgers,
McDonald's, Long John Silver's and Ralston Purina.
   Brock Music is one of about 15 Nashville companies doing music
for jingles.
   ``Our value is our versatility,'' Brock said. ``We do all
musical styles. We do a lot of different things well.''
   Brock was raised in Anderson, Ind., and worked as a jingle
singer in Dallas before he began writing jingles in 1975. He moved
to Nashville the next year. Ten years ago he wrote the music for
political advertising, including the music for Dan Quayle's first
campaign for the U.S. Senate in Indiana.
   ``We helped to elect a lot of candidates,'' said Brock, who also
was a judge in the 1989 Miss America Pageant.
   He turned to jingle writing because he didn't want to continue
doing political ads.
   His office complex has a small studio in the rear where most of
the ad music is created. He plays keyboards himself as needed.
   ``I think when you have some leeway, and the agency allows you
to be creative and do the job you feel is needed for that project,
and it comes out wonderful, it's very satisfying.''

<HEAD>Routine Restraint of Nursing Home Residents Causes Growing Concern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Harmon used to spend each day tied to
a chair in a nursing home, sometimes in a stupor, sometimes
pleading for release.
   ``They'd just sit there all day long, everybody tied in
restraints,'' said Mabel Harmon, who moved her 70-year-old husband
out in August. ``I don't think he would be living now if he hadn't
gotten out of there.''
   Harmon's situation was not unique. Two out of five residents of
American nursing homes routinely are tied to their beds or chairs,
ostensibly to prevent injury. Yet concern is mounting that
restraints may do more harm than good.
   Harmon now is at Stapeley in Germantown, a Philadelphia home
that is one of the growing number in the United States using no
restraints.
   ``Since he's been over at Stapeley, he'a a completely different
person,'' Mrs. Harmon said. ``He does what he wants to do. He
answers your questions. He walks up and down the hall. He goes into
the lounge.''
   Nursing homes say they use restraining devices such as lap
belts, wheelchairs with locking trays, and vests tied to beds or
chairs mainly to keep residents from falling or wandering away and
to control aggressive behavior.
   Critics say restraints often are used for convenience and seldom
eliminate the risk of injury. They say restraints can create
problems including emotional withdrawal, depression, injuries
incurred trying to get free, strangulation, constipation,
incontinence, pressure sores, loss of bone mass, weakened muscles,
decreased ability to walk and eventual invalidism.
   ``We have to ask ourselves: What price safety?'' said Jill
Blakeslee, director of health services for The Kendal Corp., a
non-profit Pennsylvania corporation governed by Quakers that has
pioneered the concept of restraint-free nursing homes in the United
States. ``Safe and quality care can be given to our frail old
people without tying them to their beds and their chairs.''
   Kendal and the Senate Committee on Aging this month sponsored a
symposium, ``Untie the Elderly: Quality Care Without Restraints,''
where Blakeslee urged: ``Think about yourself as you grow old. Is
that what you would want?''
   Michael Plevyak's family chose to place his 74-year-old mother,
Genevieve, who has Alzheimer's disease, at Friends Hall in West
Chester, Pa., because it uses no restraints.
   ``The only thing she desires to do is move about and walk,'' he
said. ``That's why we're so thrilled that she is in a facility that
allows her to engage in the one activity she gets any joy out of.''
   Forty-one percent of nursing home residents were restrained in
1988, up from 25 percent in 1977, federal surveys show. Thirty-five
people in U.S. and Canadian nursing homes strangled or suffocated
because of restraints from 1980 to 1987 and two burned to death
trying to escape by lighting their restraints, the Press-Telegram
of Long Beach, Calif., reported in a 1987 investigation.
   In U.S. and Canadian nursing homes studied over the last decade,
restraint rates ranged from 25 percent to 85 percent, Neville
Strumpf and Lois Evans of the University of Pennsylvania School of
Nursing reported in the January 1989 issue of the Journal of the
American Geriatrics Society.
   Family members initially may be horrified that a relative is
restrained, but medical professionals ``can talk people into a big
variety of things that afterwards they must wonder about,'' said
Lynne Mitchell-Pederson, a nurse at St. Boniface General Hospital
in Winnipeg, Manitoba. St. Boniface has nearly eliminated
restraints since a patient strangled in 1981.
   On the other hand, there are attorneys and family members
``wanting and willing to sue if a home doesn't use protective
devices to protect the safety of the resident,'' said Fred Watson,
administrator of the Christian City Convalescent Center in Atlanta.
``We've got to get over that hurdle.''
   Christian City was restraint-free when it opened 12 years ago
but began using the devices under pressure from insurers, doctors
and families, Watson said. It now restrains 20 percent to 30
percent of its patients, but is reducing that.
   The widespread use of restraints is widely attributed at least
in part to nursing homes' fear of being sued, but some attorneys
say reliance on restraints as a shield against litigation is
largely unneeded.
   A study of cases found that use of restraints led to more
successful lawsuits than non-use, said Philadelphia attorney Alan
Reeve Hunt, chairman of Kendal's board. For example, an Alabama
jury in June held a nursing home liable for $2.5 million in the
strangulation of an 86-year-old woman in a restraint vest that was
on backwards. The ruling is under appeal.
   Restraints ``became a standard of care without ever being
tested,'' said Sarah Burger, a consultant for the National
Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform. ``Everybody just
assumed they did good.''
   Growing concern about negative effects and recognition that
restraints don't eliminate legal risk are spurring a reduction in
their use. Thirteen U.S. nursing homes are known to be
restraint-free, according to Kendal. Tough new federal rules take
effect in October, and Florida has untied 3,000 people since August.
   ``There's a contest going on to see who's going to be the first
restraint-free facility,'' said Florida licensing director Connie
Cheren.
   ``This is not a movement in its infancy,'' said Nancy Dubler, an
attorney in the Department of Social Medicine at Montefiore
Hospital and Medical Center in New York. ``This is a discussion on
the verge of bringing change.''
   The new federal rules ban ``physical restraints imposed or
psychoactive drugs administered for purposes of discipline or
convenience, and not required to treat the resident's medical
symptoms.'' Nursing homes for the first time will have to ``show
that they have tried every other conceivable means to solve the
problem,'' Burger said.
   Removing restraints requires creative, individualized
alternatives, said Beryl Goldman, Kendal associate director for
health services. For example, doors that sound a buzzer when opened
might be installed on wanderers' rooms, brightly colored tape in
front of exits helps discourage confused residents from leaving,
and rocking chairs can soothe residents who need to be in motion.
   One home was able to avoid restraining an 85-year-old woman who
constantly paced with a doll but needed rest so her ulcers could
heal, said Joanne Rader, director of mental health at Benedictine
Nursing Facility in Mount Angel, Ore.
   Staff members filled the doll with seven pounds of birdseed.
``Now, when she's walking with the doll, she has a very heavy baby.
So they said, `Oh, that baby's so heavy. Why don't you sit down and
put your feet up?' That's a heck of a lot more fun than tying a
person down,'' Rader said.
   St. Boniface's Mitchell-Pederson cited the case of an
Alzheimer's patient who disrupted meals and stole food. ``When we
asked, `Could he be hungry?' and doubled his calorie intake, he
stopped stealing food. ... In this case it was his diet that needed
attention; restraints compounded the problem.''
   An 85-year-old woman restrained in a chair for fear she would
wander off and fall down the stairs was given rubber-soled shoes
instead of slippers and ``was thus allowed to wander at will
throughout the building,'' she said.
   ``There's tremendous excitement out there ... toward developing
and implementing a non-restraint philosophy,'' Rader said. ``It's
no fun to be the one who has to tie someone down when they don't
want to be tied down.''

   Some nursing home officials, however, caution that there are
cases where there are no clear alternatives to restraints.
   ``While we all can agree that overuse or wholesale use of
restraints is not desirable, it is equally wrong to say no
restraints should ever be used,'' said David Mettler of Hillhaven
Corp., which runs 345 nursing homes in 38 states.
   ``This is not a black-and-white issue,'' Mettler said.
``Sometimes it may even be necessary to restrict the rights of an
individual resident in order to provide for the health and safety
of others.''
   For dramatic reduction in restraints, residents and families
must accept that ``if people have a certain amount of freedom, then
they also run the risk of getting hurt,'' said attorney Joanne
Ivancic of HFIC Management Co., which handles insurance claims for
Hillhaven.
   Benedictine has eliminated most restraints, but ``there's maybe
5 to 10 percent of the people that I can't figure out how to get
restraint-free,'' Rader said, citing as one example those who pull
out tubes unless restrained.
   Nursing home staffers who initially are skeptical about managing
residents without restraints usually find they prefer it, said
Kendal's Goldman. She quoted from a recent letter from a nurse at
Friends Hall, which in 1987 adopted a no-restraint policy: ``I
wouldn't work any other place now. I wouldn't have said that or
believed it two years ago.''
   Nine nursing homes in a Kendal demonstration program have
reduced restraint use without an increase in falls, staff or costs,
Goldman said.
   That is possible because residents who can move around generally
stay healthier and require less care, Blakeslee said. Also, it
takes a lot of time to properly apply restraints and remove them
for exercise and use of bathrooms.
   Stapeley in 1988 set a goal of untying five residents a month
and a year later removed the last restraint, said Henrietta
Roberts, executive director.
   ``I can't tell you how the families have been pleased by this,''
she said. ``The sense of humanitarianism, the sense that you are
dealing with a person ... has made a great deal of difference. The
patients are easier to care for.''
   Supporters of the change at Stapeley include Bernie Lieberman,
whose 89-year-old mother, Frances, had been routinely restrained
after she fell and broke a hip. Now, staffers help her walk and she
wears no restraints while seated.
   ``She seems much more cheerful and positive as a result of
having more freedom,'' Lieberman said. ``Even though her mind was
not working well, she was just the kind of person who wanted to get
up and walk.''

   Connie Cheren doesn't like the phrase
``untying the elderly,'' but she wholeheartedly supports the
concept.
   Cheren, who oversees 4,300 health care facilities, has led an
effort to reduce nursing home use of restraints, untying 3,000
people in four months. ``The only thing that I feel bad about is
that I didn't do it ... earlier.''
   When Cheren became director of the state Office of Licensure and
Certification two years ago, 41 percent of the 55,000 people in the
state's 550 nursing homes were restrained at least part of the day
by vests that fasten to beds or chairs, wrist ties, lap belts and
specially designed chairs. Several elderly people had strangled in
recent years struggling to free themselves.
   Use of restraints rose to 43.7 percent by April 1989, but was
down to 39 percent last month, federal statistics show. Cheren did
not have statistics on the use of tranquilizers, but said
regulators would try to ensure that chemical restraints are not
overly used and do not replace physical restraints.
   Cheren stepped up regulation of restraint use in August, when
she told Ambrosia Nursing Home in Tampa it could not admit new
residents until it stopped illegally using restraints simply to
prevent wandering.
   Under Florida law, restraints can be used to keep people from
falling or from disturbing medical equipment, such as feeding
tubes. They cannot be used without a doctor's permission, and
people must be released every two hours.
   Restraint reduction has caught on in the industry ``because
first of all it's right,'' she said. ``Second, it feels good.
Nobody likes to put somebody under restraint. You interact
differently with somebody in restraint. Three, it's working, and
success builds on success.''
   Cheren, a registered nurse with 20 years' involvement in
long-term care, dislikes the phrase ``untying the elderly'' because
it casts the elderly in a passive role _ ``just like `release
women' or `free the blacks,''' she said.
   Also, physical restraints came into use out of sincere concern
for safety. However, she said, it is time to focus on better
nursing home care that involves helping peple keep and restore
their abilities.
   About 1,000 nursing home owners and operators attended three
workshops on restraints in October and November. Instead of being
apprehensive about meeting new standards, people were bragging
about the progress they had made.
   ``People called me afterwards ... and told me their goal for
this year was to completely move toward a restraint-free
environment,'' said Mary Ellen Early of the Florida Association of
Homes for the Aging.
   The 454-bed Miami Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged, for
example, cut use of restraints 18 percent, said associate executive
director Terry Goodman. ``The residents are much happier, less
agitated and the staff has noted a significant decrease in the
amount of agitation and less acting out.''
   Many operators have reported resistance from families who think
nursing home residents are safer if they are restrained, Early said.
   But Cheren and other advocates of reducing restraints say the
losses that occur in mobility, bladder control and dignity far
outweigh the small risk of a serious injury due to a fall.
   ``The bottom line really is that the risk of falling really
ain't so bad,'' said Martin Casper, executive director of 250-bed
Greynolds Park Manor in North Miami Beach, which now restrains four
people, compared to 85-90 this summer.
   And while there has been concern that restraint reduction would
increase costs _ Florida homes operate on a profit margin of less
than 0.5 percent _ Casper said he has found the cost of staff
supervision remained the same.
   Cheren can even count among her supporters the administrator of
Ambrosia Nursing Home, which lost an estimated $60,000 because of
the moratorium, the toughest stricture possible short of license
revocation.
   ``I think Connie Cheren has done a fine thing,'' said Albert
Shepard, who had 10 of 80 beds empty during the 60-day penalty.
``Connie Cheren having zeroed in on this particular thing ... has
made the difference.''
   The home has fixed an alarm system that sounds when a door is
opened and set up a ``buddy'' system in which workers _ even office
and housekeeping staff _ adopt a resident for special daily
attention, including walks. Except for six or eight ``geri-chairs''
for people who can't sit alone, it has no restraints.
   ``We're very much in agreement with the whole philosophy of
non-restraint facilities,'' Shepard said. ``It's an excellent thing
to give people the freedom of movement.''

   Keith Grant never considered he'd ever have to
choose a nursing home for his wife, an active, intelligent
52-year-old mother of five.
   Then Virginia Grant's personality began to change, and months of
tests pointed to Alzheimer's disease. After three years of home
care, Mrs. Grant's behavior became so erratic her family made the
painful decision in 1985 to place her in Tel Hai Retirement
Community in Honey Brook, Pa.
   ``She would wander off, pick up things to eat anywhere, out on
the road, hitchhike, stop cars,'' Grant recalled. When family
members visited, however, they were troubled to find that more
often than not, Mrs. Grant was strapped down to keep her from
wandering and eating foreign objects.
   ``She seemed very upset and so were we,'' said her daughter,
Susan McTyier. ``Mom no longer was able to speak but she would
often look very angry or grumpy whenever we visted. Dad often made
the comment, `It looks as if she's saying, Why are you doing this
to me?'''
   Last January, Tel Hai launched a program to reduce its use of
restraints, cutting the rate from 43 percent of patients to less
than 10 percent. Confused residents who once were tied down now are
free to stroll an outdoor ``wandering garden''; those who were
restrained because they were unsteady on their feet have been
fitted with sturdy walking shoes.
   ``I remember from my nursing school days, it was considered a
standard of good care to restrain residents who might fall and
injure themselves,'' said assistant administrator Betty Petersheim.
``But now there's been a bubbling up from within the health-care
providers saying there's a better way.''
   The resulting new freedom has improved Mrs. Grant's demeanor and
that of other residents, Ms. McTyier said at a recent symposium on
restraints.
   ``She's calmed down visibly and we've also noticed an overall
happier attitude in the whole facility. It used to disturb us when
we would walk in and hear the residents moaning and crying for
help. Since the change, the noise level has dropped considerably.
...
   ``The nursing home doesn't seem like such a prison anymore when
you walk through and don't find people strapped down all the time.''

<HEAD>Factors to Consider in Choosing a Nursing Home</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-PRI--Untie the Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When considering the use of restraints, weigh potential benefits
such as safety and comfort against potential negatives including
the loss of mobility, depression and anxiety, says the Nursing Home
Coalition of New York State.
   In addition, family members and nursing home residents should
watch for these signs of possible abuse of physical restraints:
   _DISCOLORATION: Is there redness, bruising, blanching or welts?
   _PAIN: Do the restraints cause pain in wrists, waist, chest or
feet?
   _BEHAVIOR: Is there squirming in an attempt to get comfortable?
Does the resident bend forward trying to loosen restraints or rock
back and forth?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   People trying to choose a nursing home can gather important
information by relying on their senses. Sarah Burger of the
National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform suggests
considering these factors:
   _SIGHT: How do resident look? Are they up, dressed, clean,
chatting among themselves and staff, or slumped in a wheelchair? Do
rooms look personal or institutional?
   _SOUND: Is there a general level of chatter as in a normal
household? Or is there noise blaring from the TV and cries of help
or ``nurse''?
   _SMELL: Does the home smell good or does it smell of urine or a
cover-up of heavy disinfectant? Does the food from the kitchen
smell good?
   _TASTE: Eat a meal if you can. If not, ask residents how the
food is. Are they eating it?
   _TOUCH: Are handrails, bathrooms, etc., clean to the touch?
Residents will reach out to you. Take their hands. Are they clean,
with well-lubricated skin and trimmed nails, or are the hands
sticky or dry, with ragged nails?
   Also ask about quality of care and payment policies, the
coalition says.
   _QUALITY OF CARE: Ask residents and their families, physicians,
clergy and others what they think about various facilities. Visit
as many nursing homes as possible. Find out about staff. Is there a
trained social worker and a trained activities director? Do they
have assistants? How does the home handle potential staffing
shortages? Does staff turn over quickly?
   _PAYMENT: Most nursing home residents, even if they pay
privately when they enter, run out of money. Unless someone is sure
they can pay indefinitely with private funds, they should choose a
home that accepts Medicaid, find out what their state's Medicaid
eligibility rules are, and what their rights are or will be as a
Medicaid nursing home resident.
   Contact your state Office on Aging to get the name and telephone
number of the nearest long-term care ombudsman program. Ombudsmen
are empowered by law to serve as advocates for nursing home
residents and to assist with complaints.

<HEAD>Age No Bar to Physical Fitness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frieda Anderson strides into her
exercise class, warmed from a brisk bicycle ride, and puts away her
helmet.
   She's ready for her three-times-a-week class of stretching,
floor exercises, and physical activity to music ranging from 1950s
doo-wop to classical to the Grateful Dead's ``Touch of Gray.''
   Most in the class have their own touches of gray.
   This is the Walnut Creek YMCA's older adults fitness program,
some of the older Americans walking, biking and swimming their way
to better health.
   Mrs. Anderson, 73, logged 1,886 miles last year, just completed
her ninth RAGBRAI _ an annual bicycle ride across Iowa _ and rode
her bicycle at least 10 miles a day this summer. She posted the
most miles last year in a walking-jogging program, which credits
three miles of bicycling as one mile of walking.
   ``In cold weather, I walk at Valley West Mall,'' she said. ``The
rest of the time I ride my bike alone.''
   Others in the program are just discovering the rewards of
fitness.
   ``By age ... alone, there is no limit'' to when a person can
begin an exercise program, said Dr. John Rachow, of the University
of Iowa's College of Medicine. ``It's as fine if they're 89 as if
they're 63 and about to retire.''
   Norma Casserly, 62, of Des Moines, joined the senior fitness
class in February. ``The first time I went, I didn't think I would
be able to get off the floor.'' Seven months later, she weighed 10
pounds less, had cut her blood-pressure medication by a third and
felt better ``physically and emotionally.''
   Becky Harkema, director of the Walnut Creek older adults fitness
program, said it has grown from seven members in 1981 to about 100.
It is one of 34 Y's in Iowa with such programs, which generally
include 25 to 50 participants.
   Most people walk or bike in addition to the organized class and
keep logs of ground covered. They also meet monthly for lunch and
get together frequently to tour Iowa, talk about trips or discuss
the restoration of the Statehouse.
   The activity leaves participants with more energy to do more,
both physically and mentally, Harkema said. ``They can go to the
grocery store and not be short of breath. They can stay up an hour
later. The seniors who may have lost a spouse will regain new
friendships. They realize they have strengths they never knew they
had.''
   Arlene Lapscheske, 70, attends the program with her best friend
of 47 years, 72-year-old Maxine Dolan, and describes it as ``our
own special time.'' Both have been in the senior fitness program
for six years. ``I'm able to get up the stairs when other people my
age are out of breath,'' she said.
   Rachow advises patients to start an exercise program slowly, by
walking, riding a stationary bicycle or swimming. Someone who wants
to gain strength can ``start by lifting the weight of your own
limb,'' he said. ``It doesn't have to be a fancy Nautilus machine.''
   Regular exercise tends to decrease anxiety and depression and
the severity of muscle shrinkage, brittle bones and high blood
pressure, he said. ``There's already a tendency as you age to lose
muscle mass. Once you get weak, you end up going down into a chair
and not being able to get back up again.''
   Exercise also burns calories, and avoiding obesity can help
prevent high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and diabetes.
   One reason 75-year-old Nate Bernstein attends the class is so he
``can eat a little more,'' but the main reason, he said, is ``for
the girls.''

   When families lived together, older people
were a link between the past and future, reminiscing about the
history they'd lived. Today, families are far-flung and often out
of touch, but the need for a link remains.
   ``One of the important lessons of the book `Roots' is that
family and society are enormously interested in the past
experiences of individuals that they know,'' said Dr. Gene Cohen, a
psychiatrist and deputy director of the National Institute on
Aging. ``Look at how excited people are to look at old photo
albums. That's a form of reminiscing.''
   ``A lot of people have stories in them, but they haven't written
them down because there's just no place for their writing to
appear,'' said Jay Thomas Collins who, with partner William
Michaelian, offers just such a forum.
   The two in May 1988 launched Harvest, a literary magazine
featuring the reminiscences of people over 50. Michaelian, 33, and
Collins, 29, who both grew up in storytelling families, aren't
interested in family histories that merely list the comings and
goings of a particular family or group of people. Harvest is filled
mainly with the remembrances of everyday people whose good times
and bad times preceded shopping malls, freeways and fast-food
restaurants.
   The bimonthly magazine has grown in circulation to about 1,500
and gets about 40 or 50 submissions a week from around the country.
Harvest doesn't pay, but people whose articles are published get 10
free copies. Some stories are sent by professionals, but most
writers have never had anything published.
   ``We're looking for stories that really have something to say.
Whether it's polished or not is not our major concern. We just want
to present simple, honest stories,'' Michaelian said.
   ``We look for something that has lasting meaning to someone's
life,'' Collins said. ``There used to be a role for older people as
storytellers. They used to be valued for that. They've been through
good times and bad times. They have perspective, and some of their
reflections can teach you a great deal.''
   Consider ``Thanksgiving 1930,'' a story in the November-December
issue. Albert Bessler recalls waiting for several days during the
Depression to get a free food basket from the Salvation Army.
Bessler describes huddling with his brothers and sister in the
family's Model T to keep warm after their meal:
   ``When you're in a warm place and your belly is full and you
have someone to hold, what more could you want? I was thankful for
Thanksgiving Day. I was satisfied. I had a good deal.''
   Such reminiscences offer younger people new perspectives _
``they invariably derive new insights about themselves'' _ while
being a healthy experience for older people, Cohen said. ``For a
number of people, it can be a very helpful and therapeutic process
that brings them back to a broader perspective in terms of what
their life has been.
   ``The past has undoubtedly contained a number of situations
which at the time might have seemed insurmountable but yet we found
that we've gotten over them. Those reminders are very important to
help restore someone's perspective on the present.''

   The speed with which society has responded
to the AIDS epidemic is heartening, yet there is one group that
society has not begun to attend to in terms of its risk: older
Americans.
   The fact is, 10 percent of all reported cases of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome have involved people aged 50 and over. And more
older people are believed to be infected, although not yet
experiencing symptoms.
   With increased age comes a decline in immune system functions,
making older people more susceptible to a variety of illnesses such
as cancers and infections. Because of these changes in immune
function, AIDS may affect older people differently than it does the
young. Data from the Centers for Disease Control suggests that most
older people infected with the AIDS virus have developed disease
symptoms more quickly than younger patients.
   The older population also receives the highest rate of blood
transfusions. Blood banks now assure safer blood products than
before 1985, when the public blood supply was not yet being
screened for the virus. By then, however, many older people had
already been exposed to possibly contaminated transfusions. As a
result, blood transfusions are the second most common cause of AIDS
in people over 50 (after sexual contact). Moreover, no one knows
how many people received infected blood and are now unknowingly
infecting spouses or sexual partners.
   Older AIDS patients who have early symptoms also risk going
undiagnosed. Because early symptoms of AIDS, such as fatigue, loss
of appetite and swollen glands, are similar to other more common
illnesses, many people _ including health professionals _ may
dismiss them as minor ailments.
   Medical experts predict that a cure or vaccine against AIDS is
not likely to be found in the near future. So preventing the spread
of AIDS will very much depend on behavioral changes, such as using
condoms when sexually involved with someone other than a mutually
faithful, uninfected partner.
   Prevention also begins with education. AIDS is not spread by
casual contact, but rather through sexual relations, use of
infected needles and blood transfusions. Reliable, up-to-date
information is available from many sources. The Public Health
Service sent a brochure, ``Understanding AIDS,'' to every home in
the country. Call the National AIDS Hotline, 1-800-342-AIDS for
another copy; other hotlines also can answer specific questions.
   Researchers are working to understand AIDS and how to treat
people who are infected. Treatment for the symptoms usually
involves some drug therapy, such as AZT (azidothymidine), which
currently is being used in many patients to prolong life. Other
promising drugs are also being tested.
   People exposed to the virus should stay in touch with a doctor
who is well-informed about the latest research. For help finding an
expert, call a medical school's infectious disease department or
the National AIDS Hotline.
   You can make a valuable contribution by offering to help groups
in your community who work with AIDS patients. Many operate on a
shoestring and depend heavily on individual contributions of time
and money. These groups include the American Red Cross, March of
Dimes, Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs, and the local YMCA. Their phone
numbers are listed in your directory, and they will be glad to tell
you how to get involved with education, fund-raising drives or
volunteer programs.
   In the years ahead, individuals willing to offer their services
to AIDS patients will be increasingly needed. Volunteers can
contribute a great deal without endangering their health. For
example, as people with AIDS become more disabled, they have
trouble meeting their daily needs; they appreciate help with
shopping, cooking meals, or just regular visits for talking.
   For more information on volunteer programs, call your health
department or the National AIDS Hotline.

   If maintaining a home landscape is more work than
pleasure, a few changes may help. Retirement offers a splendid
opportunity to take time for a detailed assessment, and it's worth
doing whether you're 20 or 70.
   Start by determining what you and the family like, dislike or
have no strong opinion about. Be realistic. Be pragmatic. Be
diplomatic. But above all, get an honest reading. Then, have a
little fun and adopt ``KISS'' as the game plan: Keep It Simple,
Stupid.
   For example, is it worth the effort to plant, water, weed,
fertilize and prune that bed of annual flowers or bulbs? Would
low-maintenance flowering shrubs be as pleasing? Don't apologize if
the choice is the bed of flowers; just be sure. And say KISS often
when looking at things that take time.
   Before I retired, my home had a gorgeous lawn. There was Bermuda
grass in summer and, in this subtropical climate, even greener
ryegrass all winter. At least once a week, I'd empty the mower's
grasscatcher seven or eight times. The family loved that lawn _
badminton, croquet, just sprawling on the grass.
   But children and grandchildren grow older. It was used less and
less. Water bills kept climbing. Decomposed granite and native
shrubs and trees became an increasingly attractive alternative.
Now, I fill only one grasscatcher each time I mow. The saving in
time alone is considerable.
   One person's solution, of course, can be another's horror story.
But the basics never change: simplify maintenance by eliminating
unnecessary things.
   Folks who move to a different climate also need to forget
nostalgia. Heroic urban horticulture may keep alive long-time
favorites from other states, but it's usually time-consuming,
expensive and generally self-defeating. Make sure, say, that a
lilac or ceanothus will grow in the new neighborhood. Can you even
tell the difference between the East's lilac and the West's
ceanothus?
   Take the time to understand your plants' needs. Can they be
replaced with something better or simpler? The Cooperative
Extension Service, listed under the U.S. Department of Agriculture
in most telephone books, is a good source.
   Hybrid tea roses are an example of something that can be changed
without much difficulty. Their floral display is seldom matched,
yet they need enormous care. One solution is to have a hybrid tea
or two for cut flowers and replace the others with less demanding
types such as floribunda or shrub roses.
   Systemic insecticides eliminate a lot of mixing of chemicals and
spraying. Just be sure to follow the label directions carefully.
Fertilizing often can be simplified with slow-release types, though
these tend to be expensive and can be deadly if timing of the
application induces plant growth when it should be slowing. But
they're a great convenience and unmatched in container growing.
   Avoid scattered plantings. If cutting the grass, can you keep
going for long periods without backing and turning? Does a certain
shrub have to be where it impedes the mower? Would a mowing strip
eliminate hand trimming?
   Perhaps stone or gravel would look better in areas under garden
benches or house overhangs. Is a raised bed called for? Does
traffic make grass a losing battle in a certain area, dictating
paving? Would ground cover hide litter from a tree? Do some plants
always seem to be nibbled by grasshoppers, attacked by aphids or
sunburned? Why not replace them? Consider the same approach for a
tree or shrub that requires frequent pruning or leaf raking.
   A pre-emergence herbicide will control many weeds before they
start. Vegetation-killing sprays formulated with glyphosate are one
of the most important gardening developments in recent years. Even
toughies like Bermuda are a soft touch, but don't get it close to
anything green you want to keep.
   Sometimes changing the land's contour just an inch or two is all
that's needed to improve drainage. Maybe a shade-loving plant is
getting too much sun, while moving it a few feet will make it
happy. A mulch can give a neat appearance, save moisture and
protect against climate extremes.
   The list of potential problem-solvers is just about endless.
   But no solution is possible until the problem is pinpointed.

<HEAD>Complaint Seeks to Ban Senior Banking Discounts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLANTATION, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 45-year-old businessman is seeking to
outlaw the widespread practice of offering banking discounts to
older customers.
   Peter Levine, in a complaint filed with Broward County's Human
Relations Division, asks that county banks cease the deals to those
55 or older.
   ``I don't have anything against older people,'' said Levin,
owner of a tote bag manufacturing business in Hialeah. ``I just
think it's discrimination.''
   ``We believe it is proper,'' said William Darby, a vice
president at C&amp;S Bank, where Levine has an account. ``A lot of
restaurants, banks and movie theaters have done it for years.''
   If the Human Relations Division is unable to resolve the
complaint it will go to the county's Human Rights Board.

<HEAD>Actor David Keith Envisions United Elders In `Grand Corp'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor David Keith wants America to stop
wasting a precious resource _ the wisdom of its aged.
   ``To harness this power of experience and challenge the energies
of youth, to put the power back in the hands of experience, I
proposed the Grand Corps,'' said Keith, who envisions building an
organization of people 60 and older to speak out on the issues from
pornography to ecology.
   ``When I look around the country, I see young people pushing
their grandparents and the older people into a corner, putting them
in front of the TV and saying, `Here, keep your mouth shut,'''
Keith said.
   ``And I don't see the older people fighting back. I don't see
them saying, `My mind is still alive. I've got good ideas that you
ought to listen too.'''
   Keith, 35, who most recently played Oliver North in a TV
miniseries and Elvis Presley on the big screen, hopes to form the
first Grand Corps chapter in his hometown of Knoxville. He thinks
senior citizens, once unified, could carry tremendous clout both
locally and nationally because of their sheer numbers.
   Noting the growing percentage of elderly Americans, he said,
``Imagine 52 million letters arriving in Congress on the same day
to get a pornography bill put through. They are going to listen.''
   Keith said he didn't expect to get anything more from the Grand
Corps than a chance to honor the love he received from his late
grandparents.

<HEAD>Fear of Crime Makes Elderly Prisoners in Own Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the retirees who move to
Florida to enjoy their ``golden years'' wind up prisoners in their
homes because of their fear of crime, a state task force on crime
and the elderly reported.
   The 65-page report concluded that people over 60 are victimized
less often than younger people, but ``the resulting injuries or
incurred damages are more devastating'' for the older victims.
``Older persons live in abject terror of such every-day occurrences
as going to the grocery store or merely stepping outside to pick up
their Social Security checks,'' it said.
   Florida has the oldest population in the United States; by next
year, more than 2.4 million people 65 and older will live in the
Sunshine State.
   ``The high concentration of the aged in one environmental
setting acts as a magnet to criminals,'' said the report by the
Attorney General's Task Force on Crimes and the Elderly. ``Public
housing, especially for the elderly, is a prime target for purse
snatchings, robberies and burglaries.''
   Additionally, the elderly are more likely to be harmed or held
hostage during a burglary attempt as failing vision or hearing
leave them unaware there is someone in the house. And ``the elderly
are perceived by juveniles as easy targets for violence and
crime,'' said the report.
   In addition to threats from unknown criminals, the elderly are
particularly vulnerable to smooth-talkers. It is extremely easy to
control someone's assets, merely by having them sign a power of
attorney, and some unscrupulous funeral homes are adept at catching
the elderly at vulnerable times, the report said.
   Among its recommendations, the task force urged creating a
Department of Elderly Affairs, a measure already approved by voters
in 1988. The report said the Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services had become too large and bureaucratic to
function efficiently and that the agency's Division of Aging and
Adult Services appeared to be the poor stepchild of a cumbersome
system.
   The report, based on research and testimony gathered during four
months last winter, also noted that the state has begun revising
its guardianship laws and imposing tougher penalties for crimes
committed against elderly citizens.

<HEAD>Stocks Post Record High, Dollar Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at yet
another record high today, while the dollar edged down against the
Japanese yen for the fourth consecutive trading day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 257.69
points, or 0.67 percent, closing at 38,681.31. The previous record
closing was 38,586.18, set on Dec. 18.
   The dollar closed at 142.37 yen, down 0.35 yen from Monday's
finish of 142.72 yen. It opened at 142.94 yen and ranged between
142.30 yen and 142.95 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 1.86 yen in the last four trading days.
   Currency trading was inactive as the New York, London and some
other overseas markets were closed for Christmas. An estimated
$4.14 billion traded hands in spot trading.
   The dollar fell in Tokyo on profit-taking and small position
adjustments, traders said.
   Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said,
``The yen strengthened despite dollar-buying by some participants
who had taken short dollar positions following yesterday's (central
bank) discount rate hike.''
   Overall, she added, ``there was little incentive to buy the
dollar. ... In the long run, the discount rate hike will make the
yen stronger.''
   The Bank of Japan raised the discount rate, the interest rate it
charges for loans to commercial banks, to 4.25 percent from the
previous 3.75 percent. Higher interest rates usually make a
country's currency more attractive to investors.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei, which had lost more than 341
points after last Tuesday's discount rate rumor, climbed more than
640 points in this week's first two days.
   While interest-rate increases usually dampen stock investment,
dealers said the index rose because many investors felt the bank's
action removed a major cause of uncertainty.
   Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa Securities Co., said, ``The
market reacted to the hike positively because of the timing and the
amount of the hike, which was exactly what the market had
expected.''
   The index's rise slowed in the afternoon as buying in
anticipation of higher prices was offset by selling to take
profits, he said.
   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 600 million shares
changing hands on the first section, up from Monday's 500 million.
Among gainers were machinery and electrical issues.

<HEAD>Housing Is Still A Good Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For financial analysts seeking an audience there
is an almost sure formula: Forecast that the housing market is
going to be reduced to rubble.
   Anything about housing has a wide audience. More than 60 percent
of households own their homes, and many renters would like to own.
   Homeowners have big investments. They worry about their money,
and they are alert to anything said or done that might affect it.
That includes forecasts, and helps explain why forecasts of housing
debacles never cease.
   Several years ago, in fact, a book was written about the coming
collapse of housing prices. The event was never recorded by any
economic statistic or seismograph, but it didn't deter the
forecaster.
   Similar warnings have been issued throughout 1989 and the surest
bet you can make is that the outpouring of doom, much of it from
financial people who tend to measure housing as an investment only,
will continue in 1990.
   At the moment, in fact, there exists a popular notion that
single-family home sales and prices have declined sharply in much
of the country, especially in the Northeast. Specific collapses,
always available, are used to illustrate.
   The specifics, however, don't always make a generalization.
   National data show that the median price of existing
single-family homes in October 1988 was $88,900. One year later, in
October of this year, it was $92,100. That's a gain of 3.6 percent.
   Data for the Northeast, compiled by the National Association of
Realtors, shows the price of typical new single-family homes in
October 1988 was $144,400, and in October 1989 $143,300. That's a
decline of 0.8 percent, hardly a disaster and one barely worth
mentioning in the stock market.
   At that, the significance might be overdone. Oddly, that decline
in the price of new houses, tiny as it is, might indicate strength
rather than weakness. To wit:
   Falling interest rates in 1989 encouraged buyers who earlier had
been priced out of the market. Clearly, these people wouldn't seek
the most expensive homes; they would buy in the middle ranges,
creating a lower median.
   In spite of warnings and forecasts, home prices have been
remarkably stable or strong year after year. Industrial and
commercial real estate might not have done well, but single-family
housing is distinct from them.
   What has changed is the fortunes of banks that made bad loans,
and in this way a banking problem becomes a so-called crisis in
real estate.
   Since 1972, Census Bureau figures show not one year in which
prices of new and existing homes have failed to rise nationally,
although there have indeed been been regional or local declines.
   But, while bad news in one stock, unless it is IBM or General
Motors, rarely is used to suggest a general market decline, that
reasoning isn't always applied to housing.
   Housing is, in fact, an even better investment than shown on
some popular Wall Street charts of relative values. Most charts of
comparative investments relate the percentage gains in housing to
the total price. However, most Americans put down but a fraction of
the price when buying homes. They take loans instead.
   When ordinary folks buy stock they usually pay full price rather
than go on margin, or borrow from the broker. To borrow may be
unwise because of volatility. So, if a $10 stock rises $1 they
usually have a 10 percent gain.
   When a $50,000 house, bought with $5,000 down, rises in value to
$55,000 the apparent gain is also 10 percent. But, since it was
purchased with only $5,000 down the real return to the homeowner is
100 percent.
   The homeowner pays interest on the mortgage, and real estate
taxes, insurance and upkeep, but he or she also receives big income
tax deductions not available to shareowners, and gets to sleep in
the home-investment.
   Remember it the next time financial ``experts'' proclaim the end
of the world in housing. And remember, some of these are the same
ones who created a brokerage house recession and billions in bad
loans for banks.

<HEAD>Daiwa Securities Acknowledges Unfair Stock Transactions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daiwa Securities Co. has been punished for
compensating a customer for losses in stock transactions, a company
official said Tuesday.
   The official said the company had not violated any laws, but
quoted Daiwa President Masahiro Dozen as apologizing for unfairness
to other investors.
   The Finance Ministry has prohibited Daiwa, one of four major
Japanese securities firms, from raising capital through public
share offerings for the time being, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The ministry also ordered the company to refrain from corporate
customer business for two days, he added.
   Finance Ministry officials were not available for comment after
office hours Tuesday.
   Kyodo News Service said the ministry had discovered that Daiwa
Securities compensated for a corporate customer's losses in stock
transactions between 1975 and 1980, but could not find out whether
Daiwa had entered into a contract guaranteeing the customer against
losses in stock transactions, a violation of the Securities and
Exchange Law.
   Kyodo said the ministry's investigation showed Daiwa had
obtained about 12 billion yen, or $84 million, from selling a
subsidiary's stock and paid 11.3 billion yen to a customer that had
lost in stock transactions and 700 million yen as a commission to a
company that settled the matter.
   The Daiwa official confirmed such transactions, but declined to
give figures.
   He said four former Daiwa employees involved in the affair would
resign.
   The pay of Dozen and 11 other executives would be cut by 10
percent for periods of three months to one year, the official said.
   Kyodo said the ministry investigated after press reports alleged
that Daiwa had filed false business reports to cover up losses it
incurred in compensating the customer.

   The first stock exchange in

   It said the exchange was founded with a total capital of $17

   The exchange will list Yugoslav and foreign companies and will
publish the so-called YUIX _ the Yugoslav Index _ of average

   A capital and securities market was established last month in
Belgrade in keeping with reformist Premier Ante Markovic's policy

   The number of working domestic oil and gas rigs
dropped by 18 to total 1,061 after rising by 21 last week,
officials of Baker Hughes Inc. reported Tuesday.
   The company said the latest rig count is up from the 940 posted
a year ago.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500.
   But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in
the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that
bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began compiling
figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, California showed the
largest gain with seven, while Michigan posted six more rigs and
Colorado and Louisiana each added two.
   Of those showing losses for the week, Texas and Kansas each
dropped 13 rigs, Ohio had four, and New Mexico and Pennsylvania
lost three each.
   Both North Dakota and Wyoming had no change for the week.

<HEAD>Grain Markets Slip In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices slipped in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with much of the
selling stemming from warming temperatures in the Great Plains and
Midwest.
   Moderating temperatures after a two-week spell of severely cold
weather eased transportation problems as well as demand for
livestock feed.
   Early selling in the soybean market also was linked to reports
of light rain in southern Brazil over the weekend and forecasts for
more moisture in that area, one of the world's major
soybean-producing pockets.
   It is early summer in Brazil. Dry weather during the planting
season had stirred drought fears, but those concerns have faded as
growing conditions improved in recent weeks.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $4.10} a bushel;
corn futures were \ cent to } cent lower with March at $2.38\ a
bushel; oat futures were 1 cent to 1\ cents lower with March at
$1.53 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with January
at $5.69 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which also reflected the warmer
temperatures in the nation's midsecton.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 76.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .10
cent lower with January at 84.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .03
cent to .28 cent lower with February at 48.62 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .35 cent to .55 cent lower with February at 49.27

   The frigid weather that swept through much of the
South over the holiday weekend has caused substantial damage to
Florida's $3.5 billion citrus crop and hurt other important winter
crops, agriculture officials say.
   ``This freeze has just devastated us,'' said Anne Goodnight,
commissioner in Collier County, which has many winter vegetable
crops and some citrus. She said she planned to ask Gov. Bob
Martinez for disaster aid this week.
   In Texas, state officials estimate 70 percent of the citrus crop
and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were destroyed when
temperatures plunged into the low 20s and upper teens.
   Losses there were estimated at $200 million. But some Texas
officials and growers predicted they would be higher because
warming temperatures ruined any hopes of salvaging the frozen fruit
for juice.
   Although Florida officials haven't released actual production
losses, the freeze damage is likely to be substantial since much of
the state's crop was still on the trees when temperatures dipped
blow freezing starting on Saturday.
   The plunging temperatures taxed the state's utilities over the
weekend and again today. The power companies tried to divide the
misery by cutting electricity to different areas for short periods
of time, but the moves wreaked havoc on citrus groves.
   Most growers abandoned traditional methods of protecting their
crops, such as using smudge pots or wind machines, and instead used
networks of microjets, which spray water on the trees to protect
them from freezing.
   When the power went off, the protective irrigation systems
failed.
   ``There was nothing I could do about it,'' said John Heist, a
Lake County citrus grower. ``They turned off the electricity at
about 9 a.m. (Sunday). But it was too cold and the system froze in
parts.''
   ``We would have been better off not to turn on the system at
all.''
   Immokalee, a winter vegetable production center, was hit hard by
the chill.
   Farmers said the area lost more than 90 percent of its tomatoes,
peppers and other vegetables, which are worth more than $200
million yearly.
   Among the few happy farmers were strawberry growers who came
through the hard freeze better than others.
   ``No wind, no problem,'' said Roy Parke of Parkesdale Farms, a
berry farmer in Plant City.
   A lack of wind allows irrigation systems to build an even layer
of ice on fragile plants to protect the bloom. Wind scatters the
water from sprinklers, allowing colder temperatures to get to the
plants and damage or kill them.
   Parke estimated that the $162 million berry industry likely
would suffer only half the loss expected.
   Growers were not the only agricultural workers suffering from
the freeze. Migrant workers found their livelihood endangered.
   ``If there aren't any other crops to pick, these people don't
have any other place to work,'' said Charles Esposito, program
manager for the Beth-El Mission in Plant City.
   More than 10,000 migrant workers living in Immokalee for the
picking season, which runs from November through May, may be
unemployed. Before the freeze, they earned $40 to $125 a day.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed modestly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as temperatures in U.S.
growing areas rose, slowing feed-grain demand and easing
transportation problems.
   Soybeans for near-term delivery slipped below $5.70 a bushel for
the first time since early November. The soybean market had risen
sharply in recent weeks as temperatures fell in the Great Plains
and Midwest, reflecting the increased demand for soybean meal as a
high-energy livestock feed.
   Further selling of soybean futures was linked to reports of
light rain in southern Brazil over the weekend and forecasts for
more moisture in the region, one of the world's major
soybean-producing areas.
   It is early summer in Brazil. Dry weather during the planting
season had stirred drought fears, but those concerns have faded as
growing conditions have improved in recent weeks.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 1} cents
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $4.10 a bushel;
corn futures were { cent to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.38{ a

<HEAD>Iacocca: 1990 Could Be Car Industry's Toughest Year in Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca
said Tuesday that 1990 could be the toughest year in a decade for
the auto industry, which already is hurting from declining sales
and temporary layoffs.
   Iacocca said in a year-end statement that 1989 sales of 9.8
million cars and 5.1 million trucks mark a return to a ``more
normal trend'' after four years of combined industry sales of 15.2
million to 16.3 million vehicles.
   He said sales estimates for 1990 of 9.5 million cars and 5
million light trucks are based largely on costly incentive programs
across the industry in an attempt to drum up buyers. Iacocca said
the industry has a production capacity of 22 million cars and
trucks.
   Iacocca said ``1990 is going to be even tougher, maybe the
toughest year the industry has faced in a decade.''
   Chrysler earlier this month launched a 45-day, $1,000 incentive
on its minivans. The incentive, which ends Jan. 31, was the
first-ever rebate on the automaker's popular minivans.
   The nation's Big Three automakers, Chrysler, General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co., last week announced temporary shutdowns
of many assembly lines in January.
   Sales are expected to return to years-earlier levels because of
decreased demand as people worried about the nation's economy
postpone buying, Chrysler spokesman John McCandless said.
   But he added that the projected total of 14.5 million cars and
trucks would be a ``pretty good year.''
   Iacocca also said Chrysler's $1 billion cost-cutting program
announced earlier this year and attempts to develop new technology
are aimed at keeping the No. 3 automaker competitive.

   The dollar declined Tuesday against most key
foreign currencies in extremely thin post-holiday trading.
   Gold prices fell here after rising in Asia.
   The financial markets were closed on Monday in the United States
and in Europe in observance of Christmas.
   But dealings remained sparse Tuesday as many U.S. traders
decided to extend their holiday and most European markets remained
closed for Boxing Day.
   Traders said the market had little reaction to the Bank of
Japan's decision Monday to raise its discount rate _ the interest
charged for loans to commercial banks _ to 4.25 percent from 3.75
percent. The move, which boosts the value of the yen against the
dollar, had been widely anticipated by the market, they said.
   Nonetheless, the overall sentiment toward the dollar remains
bearish as prospects for lower U.S. interest rates rise with more
evidence of economic weakness, said Earl I. Johnson, a trader with
Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.37 yen, down 0.35 yen from
Monday. In New York, the dollar traded at 141.845 yen, lower than
142.35 yen Friday.
   The dollar lost value against the British pound, with sterling
costing $1.6265, higher than $1.62425 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Friday, included: 1.6987 West German marks, down from 1.7070;
1.54825 Swiss francs, down from 1.5490; 1.16005 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.15925; 5.8020 French francs, down from 5.8345; and
1,272.75 Italian lire, down from 1,277.75.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell $6.40 to $406.80 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank
in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $407 a troy ounce, off
$6.75 from Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 40 cents to close at $413.85 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion settled at $5.512 a troy ounce on New York's
Comex, down 4.8 cents from late Friday.

<TEXT>
   Three days before federal bank regulators
approved a delay in seizing Lincoln Savings and Loan in May 1988,
the private accountant whose audits influenced the decision
switched jobs and went to work for the thrift's owner, according to
documents and interviews.
   The two regulators whose votes delayed the seizure for a year
say they did not know at the time that the accountant, Jack D.
Atchison, had taken the new job _ said by one member of Congress to
pay $900,000 annually.
   But in recent statements, former Federal Home Loan Bank Board
chairman M. Danny Wall and board member Roger F. Martin said their
decision concerning the fate of Lincoln _ the nation's costliest
thrift failure _ might have been different if they had been
informed.
   ``Certainly, it would have had an effect on the decision had he
known,'' said Karl Hoyle, an aide to Wall. ``Could it have swung
the other way (in favor of immediate seizure)? Maybe.''
   Attempts to reach Atchison for comment proved futile. His lawyer
also declined to discuss the matter, first reported by The Arizona
Republic, and said that Atchison would not talk about it with
reporters.
   By a 2-1 vote on May 5, 1988, the three-member bank board
decided against a recommendation from San Francisco regulators to
seize the troubled savings and loan. The group decided instead to
launch a new federal examination of the thrift's books. The effect
of the decision was to permit the bank to continue operating for an
additional year under the ownership of Charles H. Keating Jr.
   By the time the regulators ousted Keating and took control on
April 14, 1989, the cost of protecting depositors had soared, and
may now total more than $2 billion.
   Wall earlier this month resigned as head of the bank board's
single-administrator agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision,
under pressure from Congress because of his handling of the Lincoln
case. He remains in the job until a successor is named.
   The delay in seizing Lincoln generated a barrage of news stories
about Keating, especially the $1.3 million he and associates
contributed to campaigns and causes of five senators who intervened
with the regulators on his behalf.
   The Senate Ethics Committee has begun a formal investigation to
determine whether the intervention was linked to the money. All the
senators have denied any wrongdoing.
   Since 1986, favorable audit reports on Lincoln had been written
by Atchison, who was managing partner in the Phoenix office of the
large accounting firm of Arthur Young _ now Ernst &amp; Young.
   Bradley Boland, Keating's spokesman, said Atchison began working
for Lincoln's parent firm _ American Continental Corp. of Phoenix _
on May 2, 1988, three days before the crucial meeting of the bank
board. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said Atchison's salary with American Continental was $900,000 a
year.
   An Arthur Young memo confirmed the timing of the job change,
saying that Atchison ``decided to accept a position with American
Continental Corp. effective May 1, 1988.''
   Last Nov. 7, Atchison refused to answer questions before
Gonzalez' committee, claiming a Fifth Amendment constitutional
right against self-incrimination.
   At the time Atchison switched jobs, the San Francisco-based
regulators were telling the bank board that Lincoln was in such
serious trouble that it should be taken over by the government.
   But Atchison's audits, according to a transcript of the bank
board's May 5, 1988 meeting, concluded that the thrift had enough
reserves to cover losses and had met net worth requirements.
   Faced with the differing opinions, the bank board conducted its
2-1 vote to freeze Lincoln's level of investments, transfer the
bank board investigation from San Franciso to Washington and begin
a new probe of the Irvine, Calif. thrift.
   Wall and Martin voted in the majority, while board member
Lawrence J. White constituted a single-vote minority who favored
immediate government seizure.
   Martin said in an interview that he didn't know that Atchison
had gone to work for American Continental three days before the
meeting. He said he ``would have been concerned'' had he known, and
``absolutely'' would have raised questions about the impartiality
of the audits.
   ``We were were very dependent on the accountant's opinion,'' he
said.
   Wall spokesman Hoyle said his boss ``did not have any
knowledge'' of the job change.
   ``At a minimum, he would have wanted to go back and check with
Arthur Young,'' Hoyle said. ``No doubt we would have looked at
things differently, because it would have made the data suspect.
It's a significant factor if you knew perhaps these numbers were
tainted.''
   D. Jeffrey Hirschberg, associate general counsel for Ernst &amp;
Young, said, ``We clearly have no evidence (Atchison) committed any
impropriety when he was a partner at Arthur Young.''
   ``We have partners that leave all the time for better-paying
jobs in industry,'' he said. ``It's not unusual. Just because Jack
left does not mean the audit was improper.''

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Rocket After Florida Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices soared Tuesday after a weekend
freeze in the South that damaged a portion of the Florida orange
crop and wiped out 70 percent of the Texas citrus crop.
   Heating oil futures prices also climbed dramatically following
an explosion at the nation's second-largest petrochemical refinery.
   On other commodity markets, coffee and cotton futures rose
sharply, precious metals futures fell, livestock and meat futures
advanced and grains and soybeans retreated.
   On the New York Cotton Exchange, the contract for January
delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice jumped 16.1 cents to
$1.531 a pound, an 11.8 percent gain. The contracts for March and
May delivery rose their permitted daily limits of 5 cents a pound.
   Florida officials said it was too early to estimate the damage
that occurred to the state's $3.5 billion citrus crop when
temperatures plunged below freezing over the weekend.
   Celeste Georkakis of Cargill Investor Services Inc. said her
firm's early assessment was that 20 percent to 30 percent of the
Florida orange crop had been destroyed, which would be less than
was lost in Christmas Day 1983 freeze.
   But the market's reaction Tuesday indicated the damage was
probably worse than most traders had expected, Ms. Georkakis said.
   Orange juice prices had been falling before the freeze threat
surfaced last week, a reflection of increased Brazilian orange
production, which is expected to reach a record 290 million boxes
in 1990.
   Analysts said imports of Brazilian orange juice should make up
for damage to the Florida crop. So instead of a sharp price
increase at the retail level because of the freeze, Ms. Georkakis
said, U.S. consumers may simply see a halt to falling prices or
only a slight rise.
   But Robert Behr, economic research director for the Florida
Department of Citrus, said he had heard rumors that at least one
Florida processor planned to raise its wholesale price of frozen
concentrated orange juice to $1.50 from $1.37 a pound because of
the freeze.
   Heating oil futures prices surged on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in the wake of a weekend explosion at an Exxon Corp.
refinery in Baton Rouge, La., raising prospects of further spot oil
shortages.
   The accident at the plant aggravated a price spike caused by the
record-setting cold snap that has hit much of the nation. Supplies
of home heating oil already were tight before the explosion and the
accelerated demand has pushed retail prices as high as $1 a gallon
in some areas.
   Heating oil futures climbed 1.75 cents to 10.74 cents with
January settling at 92.48 cents a gallon; crude oil settled 53
cents to 63 cents higher with February at $21.91 a barrel; unleaded
gasoline was 1.9 cents to 5.49 cents higher with January at 60.94
cents a gallon.
   Coffee futures climbed above 80 cents a pound for the first time
since Oct. 2 on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid
reports of a weekend freeze in Mexico's coffee-growing region.
Coffee settled 4.18 cents to 4.5 cents higher with March at 82.67 a
pound.
   Cotton futures rose sharply on the Cotton Exchange on a
combination of technical factors and rumors that China had
purchased a large amount of U.S. and Pakistani cotton. Cotton
settled 1.13 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with March at 70.71
cents a pound.
   The easing of tensions in Panama and Romania prompted a sell-off
of precious-metals futures on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold futures finished $6.40 to $6.70 lower with December at
$406.80 a troy ounce; silver was 4.8 cents to 5 cents lower with
December at $5.512 a troy ounce.
   Live cattle settled .33 cent to .95 cent higher with February at
77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .48 cent higher
with January at 85.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent to .53
cent higher with February at 49.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .70 cent higher with February at 49.77
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures moved modestly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade as temperatures in U.S. growing areas rose, slowing
feed-grain demand and easing transportation problems.

   Prices closed narrowly mixed on Wall Street
Tuesday as rising oil prices triggered concerns about inflation and
interest rates.
   Stocks tracked the credit markets for much of the session,
declining in early trading as Treasury prices slumped. Wall Street
later shook off the drop in bonds and moved moderately higher, but
in late afternoon the credit markets continued to fall in response
to a surge in oil prices and stocks gave up their gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed 2.13 lower at
2,709.26 after rising as high as 2,728.88 earlier in the day.
   Advancing issues were slightly ahead decliners in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 712 up, 664
down and 552 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a slim 77.61
million shares, down from 120.98 million in the previous session.
Many traders were extending their Christmas holiday weekend.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 99.09 million shares.
   Treasury prices skidded first because of an increase in Japan's
discount rate, which raised the specter of interest rates rising in
the United States to keep up with Japanese yields.
   Bonds continued to drop in later trading because of a surge in
oil prices after several oil companies reported refinery shutdowns.
   Rising energy prices are considered a harbinger of higher
inflation and, in turn, higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve
is less likely to relax credit and allow interest rates to drop
when inflation is accelerating.
   The January price for a gallon of home heating oil jumped nearly
10.74 cents to 92.48 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
while the Treasury's 30-year bond was down about 1\ point, or
$12.50 per $1,000 in face amount, in late afternoon. The bond's
yield soared to 7.99 percent from 7.88 late Friday.
   ``The bond market finally put the chill into traders,'' said
Michael Metz, a stock market analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Stock prices had risen as bargain hunters entered the market but
by late afternoon ``the bargains were resistable and they walked
away,'' Metz said.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $2.784 billion, or 0.08
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.23 to 191.72.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.70 to 395.65, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was off 0.61 at 346.81.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.69 to 445.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 370.80, down 0.04.
   The most active issue on the NYSE was Bank of New England, which
fell [ to 7].
   Exxon, forced to shut down a major Louisiana refinery following
a weekend fire, was off { at 50[.
   Bank of Boston picked up 1] to close at 18[ after it was
disclosed that a group led by CBS chief executive Lawrence Tisch
held a 6.6 percent stake in the company.
   UAL surged 7\ to 170\ amid continued speculation that the parent
of United Airlines might go private in an employee-led buyout.
   Among other big-name stocks, IBM was down ~ to 94{, AT&amp;T was

<HEAD>Ford Announces Voluntary Recall of More Than 36,000 Vans, Trucks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday announced a
voluntary recall of more than 36,000 Aerostar vans and Ranger
trucks, citing possible brake or throttle defects.
   The automaker said it is notifying owners of about 32,000
1990-model Aerostars that the vans' master brake cylinders may
malfunction.
   In weather colder than 40 degrees, a seal in the master cylinder
could lose its effectiveness, which could cause excessive brake
pedal travel and increased stopping distances, Ford said in a
statement.
   But there is no chance that the brakes could fail due to the
problem, Ford spokeswoman Anne Doyle-Farrell said.
   Ford also is notifying owners of 4,355 1990-model Rangers with
4.0-liter engines that throttles may stick.
   Ford knows of no accidents or injuries that have occurred
because of the possible problems, Doyle-Farrell said.
   Of the affected vehicles, an estimated 855 have been delivered;
the rest are being held at dealers or are in transit to dealers.
   Owners are being notified of the voluntary recall by mail and
are being asked to return the vehicles to their dealers to have
corrective work performed at no cost.

   Aspen Airways Inc. said Tuesday it reached an
agreement to sell aircraft and routes except for those serving the
ski resort of Aspen to Mesa Airlines Inc. Terms of the deal were
not released.
   Aspen Airways President Don Ringsby said transition is to begin
in mid-February and should be completed by June.
   Mesa Airlines, based in Farmington, N.M., said it will seek an
agreement with United Airlines to operate the former Aspen Airways
routes as a United Express carrier.
   The agreement covers Denver-based Aspen Airways' service in
Montrose, Colorado Springs, Durango, Gunnison and Grand Junction in
Colorado; Sheridan, Casper, Gillette and Jackson, Wyo.; and
Farmington.
   Ringsby said Aspen Airways would continue to serve Denver, Los
Angeles, Chicago and Dallas with four British Aerospace 146 jets,
which seat 86 passengers each.
   Mesa said it would offer jobs to all Aspen Airways employees in
those cities, and replace 10 Convair 580s Aspen Airways with new
aircraft. In addition, Aspen Airways' Denver station will handle
all Mesa Airlines' passengers in Denver.
   Mesa said in a statement the acquisition would add about $40
million to its revenue. Mesa reported revenue of $22.5 million
during fiscal year 1989.

   Walter J. Connolly Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer of the Bank of New England Corp., will resign his
CEO position when a replacement is found, the troubled bank said in
a statement Tuesday.
   Asked if this meant Connolly will stay on as chairman, Marcia
Ryan, a bank spokeswoman, said only ``the word of the release is as
it stands.'' She acknowledged ``there is an ambiguity'' about the
wording regarding Connolly's future position with the bank.
   Bank of New England also announced Tuesday it had designated the
executive committee of its board of directors and three special
board committees to examine key structural aspects of its business
and operations.
   Since the bank's troubles began, federal banking regulators have
increased scrutiny of its operations. Financial analysts had
speculated that a major reshuffling of the bank's top management
was forthcoming.
   ``It's certainly been rumored around Hartford and Boston that he
(Connolly) might step aside,'' said Tracey Stangle, an analyst with
First Albany Corp., who works out of Hartford, Conn. ``I guess for
that reason it didn't come as a surprise.''
   The announcement came after the stock market closed Tuesday.
Bank of New England was the most active issue on the New York Stock
Exchange, with more than 2.2 million shares changing hands. The
shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $7.37{.
   Stangle said Connolly has been a driving force at the bank.
``He's a very strong-willed guy that has run the institution for
the past 10 years or so,'' he said, adding it was unclear who would
take his place as chief executive.
   The bank's board appointed a committee to begin a search for
candidates to succeed Connolly, who said he would resign his post
as chief executive when a replacement is found, the company said in
a statement.
   The statement said Connolly will continue working with another
board committee on further expense reductions, financial matters
and other improvements in operations.
   In another sign of its financial difficulties, the bank on
Friday rescinded its common stock dividend of 34 cents a share for
the fourth quarter. Earlier this month, the bank said it would
boost its loan reserves above $1 billion and that it expected a
``substantial'' loss for the year.
   The new special committees are ``designed to assure that the
problems faced by the organization as a result of the unprecedented
developments in the real estate market are addressed in a timely
and comprehensive manner,'' the statement said.
   The special committees, made up of non-management board members,
would work closely with the corporation's management and the bank
regulatory agencies, the company said.
   Gordon I. Ulmer, the company's president, was named to begin an
effort to address all aspects of the real estate loan portfolio of
Bank of New England's banking subsidiaries in Massachusetts. He was
charged to report to the executive committee of the company's
board, assisted by the board's special advisor, Washington-based
Secura Group.
   Industry analysts said the move reflected the serious trouble
Bank of New England faces due to a real estate slump that affected
a number of other banks in the region.
   Bank of New England also said Tuesday it is continuing to work
with the investment firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to explore possible
asset sales or mergers. A special board committee has been named to
oversee this effort, the company said.
   Separately Tuesday, an investor group that includes CBS Inc.
Chief Executive Laurence M. Tisch said it holds a 6.6 percent stake
in Bank of Boston Corp., New England's largest bank.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
group said it acquired the 4.7 million shares for investment
purposes only. It paid $94.5 million for them.

<HEAD>El Paso Natural Gas Reaches $300 Million Settlement With Transamerican</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Paso Natural Gas said Tuesday it will
pay Transamerican Natural Gas Corp. $300 million to settle a
lawsuit stemming from a gas purchase dispute involving jointly
owned properties in Texas.
   El Paso, a pipeline company owned by Burlington Resources Inc.,
said it will pay Houston-based Transamerican plus turn over oil and
gas mineral interests on the La Perla Ranch in Zapata County, which
El Paso estimated have a current market value of $90 million to
$110 million.
   The agreement settles a lawsuit filed by Transamerican over a
``take-or-pay'' contract with El Paso. Under such contracts,
purchasers agree to pay a supplier for natural gas, whether or not
they take immediate delivery.
   El Paso spokesman John McFall said a Houston jury ruled in favor
of Transamerican in April 1988. The initial judgment of $602
million plus attorney fees and court costs eventually was reduced
to $480 million.
   The agreement terminates all gas purchases and related
arrangements with Transamerican and requires the dismissal of
lawsuits now pending before a Texas state appellate court.
   El Paso said it expects the settlement to be implemented Jan. 31
after certain government clearances. The company said it will seek
to recover 75 percent of the settlement through its pipeline rates.
   Burlington Resources is the former energy unit of Burlington
Northern Inc., which was spun off as a separate company last year.
