<HEAD>Man Wanted in Mexican Slayings Won't Contest Deportation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused in the drug-related torture
slayings of 12 people at his ranch near Agua Prieta, Mexico, will
accept deportation to Mexico, his attorney said Thursday.
   Hector Fragoso Burqueno, accused of murder and other charges in
Mexico, agreed to the deportation Thursday provided his U.S.
citizenship application remains valid, attorney Alfred S. Donau III
said following a hearing before Immigration Judge John McCarrick.
   Donau said the effect of Thursday's deal ``was to preserve
(Fragoso's) right to pursue his citizenship application and at the
same time set a date when he would be voluntarily returning to
Mexico.''
   The Tucson lawyer said Fragoso wouldn't return to Mexico at least
until Oct. 1 because he needs additional time to complete the
application process. However, Donau also said he doesn't expect the
application to be succesful until the charges in Mexico are resolved.
   Fragoso is entitled to citizenship, Donau said, because he is a
U.S. Army veteran.
   Fragoso had sought political asylum but that request was
withdrawn after McCarrick refused to bar reporters from the
courtroom.
   Donau said his witnesses consequently ``refused to testify if
their testimony would be made known to the public at large.''
   Fragoso, who remained in custody, is working to acquire Mexican
legal counsel before facing Mexico's charges of first-degree murder,
concealment of accomplices, criminal association and violation of
burial laws, Donau said.
   Mexican officials have said statements by Jesus Luis Tapia, 29,
who is believed to be involved in the slayings, placed Fragoso at
the ranch where the bodies of the torture victims were found, four
in a septic tank pit and eight others stuffed into a well. Aqua
Prieta is just across the border from Douglas.
   Authorities believe they were killed on March 24 and 25.
   Fragoso was arrested April 20 in a mobile home near Three Points,
a tiny community about 25 miles southwest of Tucson.
   Tapia was turned over to Mexican authorities Aug. 10 after he was
detained and questioned by authorities in Tucson.

   They made their beds, again and again. But there
was no time to lie in them during a contest for 50 housekeepers from
the city's top hotels that was _ dare we say? _ sheer bedlam.
   ``People have been killed by flying percale,'' cautioned comedian
Joe Mauro, the master of ceremonies, before the ``Fastest Hands in
the East'' contest for the coveted Brass Bed award got under way on
Thursday.
   Twenty-five beds were lined up in the New York Hilton ballroom.
The sheets, blankets and pillows were piled on tables three feet
away. Unconfirmed reports surfaced about training that involved
aerobics, high-carbohydrate diets and good-luck charms.
   Energy levels were raised a notch by an announcement that
spending money _ $500, $300 and $200, respectively _ had been added
to the top three prizes: a trip to the Fontainebleau Hilton hotel in
Miami Beach, a weekend at the Arrowwood resort in Rye Brook, N.Y.,
and a pair of his-and-hers watches.
   It was clear that Josephine Ahenkora of the Drake Hotel was a
force to be reckoned with. She bounced in her chair, smiled
confidently and cheered at just about everything.
   The housekeepers _ all women _ lined up at the head of their
beds, hands poised above the linens. Judges with stopwatches stood
at the foot of the beds; silence blanketed the room.
   Nervous contestants had a couple of false starts before Mauro
blew the starting whistle. Then the sound of snapping sheets filled
the ballroom as the contestants sprinted around the beds, deftly
smoothing and stuffing. Ahenkora doubled her pillow with a karate
chop, swiftly dispatching it into its case.
   The crowd _ filled with rooting sections of friends and coworkers
_ went wild.
   ``Tuck! Tuck!'' screamed one spectator, reminding a panting
contestant to make the required hospital corners.
   ``Come on, Hazel!''
   ``Oh, that's messy!''
   The contestants were divided into two groups for the
preliminaries. Ten semifinalists went onto the three final heats.
   To signal the judge that they were finished, they perched or
crumpled on the end of their beds.
   After everyone took a breather, Mauro announced the winners and
handed out the trophies _ miniature replicas of brass beds.
   Hazel Maye of the Helmsley Windsor Hotel took the top prize,
clocking her last three beds in a total time of 3 minutes, 37
seconds. Her friends joyfully tackled her to mark her Super Bowl of
Beds victory.
   In a post-contest interview she revealed her winning strategy:
``Before I came here I made 10 beds in less than an hour.''
   Dora Thompson of the Empire Hotel was a close second, with a time
of 3 minutes, 40 seconds. She also made the neatest-looking bed.
   ``I'm tired now,'' she told well-wishers.
   Ahenkora was clearly disappointed with her third-place finish at
3 minutes, 45 seconds.
   ``I didn't practice,'' she lamented. ``The bed is too soft; you
make one side and it pops out on the other side.''
   She can try again next year, though; sponsors promised to make it
an annual event.

   Islanders say there is a curse on
this mysterious 700 year-old ruined city they know as the Reef of
Heaven.
   The curse is so strong, they say, that no one will stay overnight.
   ``No way. The last person who stayed there was a German governor
about 100 years ago,'' said Bermin F. Wellbacher, director of
tourism and natural resources for Pohnpei, site of the city and one
of the three island states that make up the Federated States of
Micronesia. ``He was found mysteriously dead the next morning. You
wouldn't catch me there, no way.''
   But Wellbacher is more than happy for tourists to come in daytime
to see a stone megalith that is one of the wonders of the Pacific.
   It is the prime tourist attraction of this impoverished, remote
island 2,485 miles west of Honolulu.
   Few people know about Nan Mahdol. No one has fully explained how
it was built or who built it.
   Most Pacific islands never had a Stone age, but at Nan Mahdol the
walls are made of stone blocks that weight up to 50 tons.
Archaeologists believe the stones came from another island and
brought to the site on rafts. But how laborers were able to lift
them remains a mystery.
   It takes an hour by fast boat across a lagoon to reach the city.
At low tide visitors must wade through a sea grass swamp and climb
slippery rocks to the dark grey, moss-covered walls of the ruin.
   Nan Mahdol is a canal city built on 92 artificial islands 15
miles from Kolonia, the capital of Pohnpei.
   Built near the passage through the coral reef into the lagoon, it
covers 160 acres. Huge walls of basalt rock up to 20 feet high
enclose a deserted city with burial chambers, vaults made of giant
stone slabs and pathways of crushed coral.
   Scientists believe an advanced civilization built a seawall, a
priestly burial place, and adminstrative center, servants quarters,
a ceremonial center, a coconut-oil processing area and a
communications center where messages were sent by beating log drums.
   Carbon dating of the ruins indicates the city was built between
the years 1285 and 1485. Recent underwater archaeology suggests it
might be even older.
   Legend also says Nan Madol was created by magicians who then flew
off into space.
   Nowadays, people of Pohnpei are divided over who owns the city.
   The local paramount chief, Salvadore Hadley, claims it is his.
   The government also claims it.
   At stake is who gets the revenues from tourism.
   ``I don't ever want to see the day that a paramount chief and the
government are fighting one another in court,'' said Wellbacher the
tourism official. ``It goes against all our traditions. But it is
our greatest tourist asset.''
   Last year almost 8,000 tourists visited Pohnpei, a lush volcanic
island which in turn was ruled by Spain, Germany, Japan and the
United States.
   It is now the capital of Micronesia, made up of the islands of
Pohnpei, Truk and Kosrae, all formerly part of the U.S.-administered
United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
   Wellbacher wants to build a road to the shoreline near Nan Mahdol
to make the trip easier for tourists.
   He'd like to add a restaurant and souvenir shop.
   But no hotel.
   ``No one will stay overnight,'' Wellbacher said.

   For 20 years, stories have been told in Ethiopia
about two white children kidnapped or abandoned when they were very
young. A brother and sister have stepped forward, claiming to be
those children. Nairobi Bureau Chief Reid G. Miller wrote about the
two earlier this month and here is a follow-up report.

<TEXT>
   A young man and woman who may be the
legendary ``lost white children'' of Ethiopia say they have a
sister, and they introduced her during a visit to the U.S. Embassy.
   All three arrived at the embassy last week for an interview with
consul Richard Adams in an effort to find their parents.
   They say they were taken from a white family about 20 years ago
by the Ethiopian housekeeper, whose sister and brother-in-law raised
them as members of the Oromo tribe. The story of two lost white
children is told in many variations, usually involving a kidnapping.
   A representative of the International Rescue Committee in New
York has come to Addis Ababa in hopes of taking all three to the
United States.
   ``We are prepared to arrange transportation, care and education
for them in the States,'' said Ron Laytner, an author and free-lance
journalist from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Laytner and Adams say that may be difficult because Haile Mariam
Gadessa and his sisters Tegest and Lesa are, at least for now,
considered to be Ethiopian nationals.
   ``Anything we do will be legal,'' said Laytner, who carried a
letter from former U.S. Ambassador Angier Biddle Duke, a committee
director, identifying him as its representative.
   The International Rescue Committee is a non-partisan agency to
assist, resettle, rehabilitate refugees. It is supported by
foundations, corporations, unions, community groups and individual
contributors.
   Haile Mariam and Tegest came to the attention of U.S. officials
when an Ethiopian friend took them to the embassy in June.
   In their interview with consul Carol L. Rose, who retired earlier
this month, they did not mention their sister, Lesa _ fearing for
her safety, they say now.
   Meeting with the new consul last week, the three told essentially
the same story Haile Mariam and Tegest related to Mrs. Rose through
an interpreter two months ago.
   It was Adams' first meeting with the young people, thought to be
in their early 20s. An Associated Press reporter was allowed to
attend the two-hour interview.
   They say they have no clear recollection of their real parents,
but spoke for the first time of seeing a photo album in the
grass-thatched mud hut that became their home.
   Pictures in the album showed them as small children with their
white parents, they said. Haile Mariam said fire destroyed the hut
and photos years ago.
   They say they don't know for sure why they were taken to live
with the tribal couple. They believe their father became ill and had
to be evacauated, and that their mother went with him.
   Mrs. Rose, Adams and others think the story of the lost white
children may have been kept alive by occasional sightings of Haile
Mariam and Lesa. They were kept by the Oromo couple and Tegest was
sent to another family as a maid.
   The embassy has found no record of the youngsters or their
parents, but Adams said a few vague clues arose after their story
came to light.
   Adams and an Ethiopian lawyer hired by the embassy are trying to
run down the clues. He said one was a tip in a letter mailed from
Addis Ababa that the father had been a brewery chemist in Addis
Ababa.
   As a result of the article, people sent cash, checks and offers
of help to the embassy.
   ``Initially we discouraged people from sending money because,
unless these people are U.S. citizens, we would have no authority to
set up a trust account for them,'' Adams said.
   Later, he said, the State Department suggested establishing an
account through someone not connected with the U.S. government.
   ``We would like to try to set up an account through a benign
person here, a missionary or somebody,'' he said. ``There is
significant interest in this, serious interest,'' at the State
Department.
   The Oromo woman who raised the three recalls her brother bringing
them to her and denied they were kidnapped, but was vague about
brother's motives. She said he died soon afterward.
   ``They were beautiful children, very white,'' she told reporters
through an interpreter at her farm 50 miles from Addis Ababa. She is
in her 70s and divorced.
   Although they carry her last name, the youngsters bear no
resemblance to the black woman who raised them. Their hair is light
brown to blond, their complexions a ruddy bronze.
   They tell of a lifetime of physical abuse by their foster father
and other villagers because of their strange appearance.
   Adams ended the interview when they became agitated. The
interpreter said they were tired of retelling their story to
consular officers and reporters without result, and frightened by
the increased hostility of fellow villagers caused by their
notoriety.
   The BBC overseas service broadcast their story in Amharic,
Ethiopia's official language, and many Ethiopians heard it.
   Because of what the interpreter said, Adams took up an office
collection to rent a small apartment in the capital for a month. He
had the young people resettled and urged them to return to the
embassy for more conversations.
   ``If only we can jog their memories enough, we may be able to
find further clues to their identities and their parents,'' he said.
   Just before the meeting with Adams ended, Haile Mariam said:
   ``Our thought is that if our parents are dead, why haven't our
grandparents, aunts or uncles come looking for us? This is what we
always think. This is what we don't understand.''

   This week's astonishing protest that joined an
estimated 1 million people in a human chain across the Baltic
republics was the latest tactic used by local activists to advance
their demands. Here are some other snapshots from grassroots
political life in one Soviet Baltic republic.

   Democracy Central here is an ornate
four-story building where the fledgling grass-roots political
movement Sajudis uses high- and low-tech to get its message across
in the drive for Lithuania's independence.
   On the third floor, college students duplicate political
statements the old fashioned way _ by typing with carbon paper. The
copying machine is broken. One floor up, the Sajudis Information
Agency uses a new fascimile machine to receive a letter from
Washington signed by members of Congress supporting freedom for the
Baltic republics.
   The offices of Sajudis, just over a year old, have all the
trappings of an upstart citizens group struggling with meager
resources to change the world. There aren't enough phones, chairs or
desks, and the staircase is crumbling, but there is no shortage of
dedication.
   Dozens of helpers stream through the offices. Hundreds of people
stop daily at the newsstand on the ground floor to pick up a copy of
the Sajudis newspaper.
   The very existence of the office is an important political
accomplishment in a country where the government tightly controls
allotment of buildings, phones and copying machines.
   The windows look out on Vilnius' Cathedral Square, where protest
posters demanding ``Occupiers Go Home'' _ a reference to the Soviet
soldiers who have been stationed in the republic since 1940 _ and
``Freedom for Lithuania'' are displayed around a bell tower.

   Although the drive for independence is gradually gaining
official, ambiguously worded support from the Lithuanian Communist
Party, sometimes activists have to settle for symbolism.
   Dozens of streets have been de-Sovietized, or given back the
names they had before the Red Army tanks rolled in in 1940 and made
Lithuania a part of the Soviet Union.
   The street where Sajudis headquarters is located, Lenin Prospect,
was recently renamed for Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, who
made Vilnius the capital in 1322.
   A poster on the wall of Sajudis headquarters spells out the word
perestroika, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform drive, in
fading letters. A calendar depicts the currency used when Lithuania
was independent from 1918-1940. Independence activists hope the
republic will soon be able to have its own currency again.
   Graffiti artists are getting into the act. ``Red Army Go Home''
was painted in red in English on a sidewalk near a hotel frequented
by foreigners.

   They are portrayed as bride and groom or as soldiers with blood
dripping from their mouths, and are constant targets of both verbal
and physical abuse.
   Mere mention of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin once struck hatred,
loathing or fear into the hearts of millions, but in the Baltics,
the two dictators are now openly ridiculed.
   Attacking Hitler is certainly not new in the Soviet Union, and
Stalin is now officially vilified for ``repressing'' millions of
people and setting up the tight, centrally commanded economy that
Gorbachev is trying to streamline.
   But the open accusation that Stalin was in cahoots with Hitler is
relatively new.
   ``For the first time we pondered and publicly announced that
Stalin and Hitler were branches of the same tree, and their policy
was equally disastrous for our small Lithuania,'' the Vilnius
Communist Party newspaper Vecherniye Novosti (Evening News) said
Wednesday.
   The most dramatic attack on the men who engineered the carving up
of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in a secret 1939 agreement was
their burning in effigy Wednesday. Members of the Lithuanian Liberty
League _ a radical group that demands Lithuania secede from the
Soviet Union _ carried a Hitler-Stalin, two-headed soldier through
downtown Vilnius on the anniversary of the secret deal.
   The effigy was carried to an independence rally in a park, where
a speaker said the two dictators ``drank from one glass the blood of
Lithuania.'' To wind up the demonstration, the effigy was burned.
Orange flames quickly engulfed it, sending black smoke and ashes
aloft. The dictators' heads and their blood-smeared mouths were the
last to go up in smoke.

   The Who blasted off nearly a decade
of rust with a thundering performance of their rock opera ``Tommy''
on Thursday night, bringing a graying crowd of baby boomer fans to
their feet.
   Led by a 44-year-old Roger Daltrey, the Who put on a stirring
rendition of their old act, minus the guitar-smashing antics of 20
years ago.
   ``Everyone here is obviously full of love and good feelings,''
said former LSD advocate Timothy Leary, who once coined the phrase
``Turn on, tune in, drop out.''
   Leary joked about his status as a hallucinogenic guru of the
1960s. ``Well, to tell the truth, I've just taken some mushroom,''
Leary quipped as the Who stepped onto stage.
   The sold-out Universal Amphitheater show was the second of only
two complete performances of ``Tommy'' scheduled on the 25-city
reunion tour of the Who's Daltrey, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle.
   A well-dressed crowd of people in the 30s and 40s walked into the
amphitheater reading warning signs that announced sound levels could
cause hearing impairment.
   Only the faintest odor of a rare whiff of marijuana smoke could
be detected.
   The saga of ``the deaf, dumb and blind kid'' who becomes a
fantastic pinball player also featured Elton John, reprising his
1975 movie role as the Pinball Wizard, Steve Winwood as the Hawker,
Phil Collins as Uncle Ernie, Billy Idol as Cousin Kevin, and Patti
Labelle as Gypsy, the Acid Queen.
   The show, benefiting the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy
Foundation, was available live on a pay-per-view basis for $19.95
per subscriber on King Biscuit Television, a division of DIR
Broadcasting.
   The tour's first performance of ``Tommy'' was in June at Radio
City Music Hall in New York and featured the band and supporting
musicians.
   Bob Meyrowitz, president of DIR, said the show had a potential
audience of 12.5 million households.
   The New York performance was ``really mind-boggling,'' but the
West Coast staging made the opera ``a much more musical piece,''
Meyrowitz said.
   The Who came together in London in 1964 and were a premiere rock
band through the 1970s. Drummer Keith Moon died in 1978 and the
remaining members of the band retired in 1982 after a concert in
Toronto.
   Who albums between 1965 and 1982 included ``My Generation,''
``Happy Jack,'' ``The Who Sell Out,'' ``On Tour: Magic Bus,''
``Tommy,'' ``Live at Leeds,'' ``Who's Next,'' ``Meaty, Beaty, Big
and Bouncy,'' ``Quadrophenia,'' ``Odds and Sods,'' ``The Who by
Numbers,'' ``Who Are You,'' ``The Kids Are Alright,'' ``Face
Dances,'' and ``It's Hard.''

   A state law that would have barred the
sale or rental of violent videotapes to children was blocked
Thursday by a federal judge who said the measure might clash with
the right of free speech.
   Under the law signed June 20 by Gov. John Ashcroft, video
retailers could be fined as much as $200 for renting or selling
so-called ``slasher films,'' to children under age 17. The law was
to take effect Monday.
   ``The gray areas are the important ones in this case, aren't
they?'' said U.S. District Judge B. Brook Bartlett. ``Because that's
where a prosecutor and store owner could have a difference of
opinion that could get the store owner in trouble.''
   The measure, which would also apply to videos considered
pornographic under Missouri law, would require stores to maintain
separate display areas for violent films.
   Video industry groups and retailers challenged the law with a
class action lawsuit and sought the temporary restraining order,
arguing that the law would force video store owners to decide by
Monday which videos fell under the law.
   The lawsuit names Attorney General William Webster and Cole
County prosecutor Richard Callahan contends the law violates
constitutional rights of free expression, equal protection and due
process of law.
   The Missouri law restricts videos that, based on contemporary
community standards, would be interpreted by the average person to
have ``a tendency to cater or appeal to morbid interest in
violence'' for persons under 17, that depict violence that is
``patently offensive'' and lack ``serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.''
   The lawsuit said the law would require video retailers to limit
sale and rental of videos that are not obscene and not
constitutionally subject to restriction under state or federal law.
   The lawsuit said terms such as ``violence'' and ``morbid'' have
no certain meaning. It also criticized the law for applying
arbitrarily to videos only, and not to identical expression in
television, movie theaters and magazines.
   The lawsuit was filed by the Video Software Dealers Association,
the Missouri Retailers Association, the Missouri Grocers Association
and the Motion Picture Association of America and two retailers,
Video Express, Inc. of Kansas City and Bailey's C.C. Enterprises Inc.

<HEAD>Researchers Suspect Hormone Link To Adult Diabetes</HEAD>

   A hormone that may play a key role in
developing the most common form of diabetes has been discovered by
University of Minnesota and Swedish researchers.
   The hormone, islet amyloid polypeptide, or IAPP, appears to
impair the ability of insulin to regulate the level of sugar in the
blood, causing the development of Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes,
the researchers said in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   IAPP and insulin are secreted by the islet cells in the tail of
the pancreas, the researchers said.
   With the discovery, the researchers hope to find better ways to
treat Type 2 diabetes, which affects an estimated 10 million
Americans and often leads to blindness, nerve and kidney damage, and
amputations as the result of gangrene of the feet.
   The researchers are Drs. Kenneth H. Johnson and Timothy O'Brien,
who are University of Minnesota veterinary pathologists, and Drs.
Per Westermark and Christer Betsholtz, Swedish diabetes researchers.
   Johnson and Westermark first mentioned their discovery of the
hormone in the 1987 Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,
subject to official confirmation by other laboratories.
   Johnson said Wednesday that other researchers quickly replicated
the findings.
   The hormone was isolated from amyloid, a protein often found
around degenerating human and animal tissue, Johnson said. The
researchers found amyloid in microscopic quantities surrounding the
insulin-secreting islet cells of pancreases of diabetic humans and
cats.
   He said the amyloid tissue around the pancreases of diabetics was
reported in the early 1900s, but that researchers were puzzled about
its role for more than 80 years because amyloid also was found
around the pancreases of people who were not diabetic.
   Johnson began looking at the amyloid of diabetic cats 20 years
ago, and 12 years ago he and Westermark, who worked with human
cadaver pancreases, began collaborating.
   They found there were differences between the amyloid of
diabetics and the amyloid of non-diabetics.
   Three years ago, Johnson and Westermark were able to purify IAPP
from the amyloid surrounding insulin-secreting cells.
   IAPP, like insulin, is produced by normal pancreatic cells, but
O'Brien said the researchers have evidence that an excessive amount
is produced in adult-onset diabetics.
   It is likely that IAPP is just one of many hormones secreted by
the islet cells of the pancreas involved in balancing the level of
blood sugar, he said.
   ``We've found IAPP in virtually every species we have looked at _
humans, dogs, cats, guinea pigs,'' O'Brien said. ``Presumably it has
an important role in healthy, normal people.''

   Roseanne Barr faces a lawsuit that claims she
paid ``thugs'' $50 to beat a celebrity photographer as he took
pictures of her.
   Ralph Dominguez claims in a Superior Court suit filed Monday that
he was photographing the star of the hit TV series ``Roseanne'' in
her car outside the trendy restaurant Spago on July 14 when the
beating took place.
   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, said several men
approached the car Ms. Barr was in and spoke with her. She allegedly
paid them $50, after which they began to beat the photographer,
according to the suit.
   Ms. Barr, who plays an earthy, sarcastic housewife in
``Roseanne,'' had no comment on the lawsuit, said her publicist Lisa
Kasteler.
   No criminal charges were filed but West Hollywood sheriff's
deputies were investigating.

   The boy with a beanie painted on the wall
outside Spanky's Saloon is ``just some fat-faced kid,'' its owner
says. But George ``Spanky'' McFarland thinks it's him.
   The lawyer for the star of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals''
movies from 50 years ago sued in U.S. District Court on Thursday,
insisting the boy is McFarland, a 60-year-old businessman in Fort
Worth, Texas.
   The lawsuit accuses bar owner Walter Engelhardt of
misappropriating McFarland's name, identity and likeness without
permission or compensation. McFarland is seeking damages of more
than $50,000 and a court order prohibiting Engelhardt from using
McFarland's name and image.
   McFarland makes personal appearances as the grown-up Spanky.
   Engelhardt said that besides the boy painted outside his rock
music saloon, two other representations of the bar's namesake are
inside: a Spanky on a wooden plaque and a neon light depicting
Spanky with orange hair. All three look different and none
represents Spanky McFarland, he said.
   ``I must have missed the (movie) where he had orange hair,''
Engelhardt said. ``If every kid with a beanie on his head is him,
this country is in trouble. If there were actual pictures of him
here, I could understand, but not when it's just some fat-faced
kid.''

   The Rolling Stones will rehearse on a
110-foot-high stage early next week at John F. Kennedy Stadium,
where they planned a concert before city officials closed the
63-year-old stadium to the public.
   If the rehearsal stage being built is satisfactory, another just
like it will be built in Veterans Stadium, where the tour's opening
concerts will be held next week.
   A stage can't be built inside Veterans Stadium until after the
Philadelphia Eagles play the Pittsburgh Steelers in an NFL
exhibition game Saturday.
   After that stage is completed, the rehearsal set is to be
transported to Toronto, where the Stones have a Sept. 3 concert date.
   Ron Bond, the city's deputy recreation commissioner and manager
of the stadium, said that even though the city decided fire code and
other safety problems prevented a concert attended by 100,000 fans
at JFK Stadium, a rehearsal on the field would be safe.

   A graying and glib Paul McCartney formally
announced an international concert tour that he hopes will attract
both misty-eyed Beatlemaniacs and a new generation of fans.
   ``There was a time when you thought music equals youth. I don't
think that applies anymore,'' said McCartney, 47, joining other
middle-aged rockers on tour this year _ the Who, the Rolling Stones
and former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.
   Asked on Thursday if he was touring to avoid being ``left out,''
he replied, ``I suppose there's an element of that ... but it's not
my prime reason for going out.''
   Instead, he credited the continual touring of the Grateful Dead
and its leader, Jerry Garcia, with inspiring his first tour since
1976. ``If Jerry can still do it that good, there's hope for us
all,'' McCartney said.
   McCartney also said several nieces and nephews have asked him:
``Please play, because we weren't there the first time around.''
   The tour opens with three shows at the Los Angeles Forum Nov.
27-28-29.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Speaker, High Chamber.
   I want to form a government capable of acting for the good of
society, the nation and the state. Today such a task can be
undertaken only by a government open for cooperation of all forces
represented in parliament and based on new political principles.
   The history of our country is accelerating. It has happened due
to a society which does not agree to continuing life as it has been
until now.
   One has to return to Poland the mechanisms of normal political
life. The transition is difficult, but it does not have to cause
shaking. On the contrary, it will be a path to normalcy. The
principle of struggle, which sooner or later leads to elimination of
one's opponent, must be replaced by a principle of partnership.
   We will not pass from the totalitarian system to democratic one
in any other way.
   The current philosophy of the state must be changed. It cannot
take care of everything and guarantee everything. It should
facilitate and regulate activities. The most important role for the
government and administration at this moment is opening
possibilities for common actions and individual actions.
   I want to be the prime minister of all Poles, regardless of their
views and convictions, which must not be a criterion for dividing
citizens into categories.
   I will undertake efforts so that the principles of constructing
the government will be clear to all. I am especially obliged to do
that for Solidarity.
   Helpful will be the understanding of the church, which has always
stood in defense of human rights and has felt the worries of the
nation as its own. The church was and is a stabilizing force in
Poland.
   The future government must be truthful to society. It must also
create mechanisms which will allow it to hear the voice of public
opinion. We will pass certain problems to its judgment.
   If sacrifices are necessary, all must know their sense,
understand them and be able to express their opinions on the
problems occurring.
   High Chamber,
   The most important issue for society is the condition of the
national economy, which now has to be considered critical.
   How bad it is and why _ already everything has been said about
it. The problem is how to get out of it.
   I am fully aware of the great effort that repairing the economy
will require of the new government and everybody.
   The long-term, strategic goal of government's activities will be
restoring to Poland economic institutions long known and tested. I
understand by this a return to a market-oriented economy and a role
for the state similar to that in economically developed countries.
   Poland cannot afford ideological experiments any longer.
   Any changes, on which the nation's prospects and citizens'
welfare depend, are blocked today by inflation and the lack of an
economic balance manifested by poor market supplies and queues, a
state budget deficit and an unbalanced balance of payments.
Restoring equilibrium and stifling inflation is a task of utmost
economic importance, as well as political and social significance.
   Disequilibrium and inflation, increasing social tensions, can
undermine the Polish march to freedom. With high inflation there can
be no discussion about creating normal working conditions for the
nation, on which its material existence mainly will depend.
   The government, sensing an absolute and urgent need to challenge
inflation, will prepare a package of required measures, utilizing
what has been tried so far in Poland and in other countries, as well
as by referring to the experience of international experts and
financial organizations.
   We will start without delay demonopolizing the structures serving
the food market, the excessive growth of which is one of the causes
of high prices and halting rural development.
   Struggling with inflation and restoring market balance has always
and everywhere been risky for government and painful for society.
Keeping in mind the effectivness of the anti-inflation operation,
the government will do everything to make it as painless as
possible. One cannot promise, however, that it will not be felt at
all. Nobody responsibly can make such an offer.
   Poles themselves have to solve Polish problems. Our own
ingenuity, work and patience _ our own effort _ will determine our
success.
   This does not mean that we are doomed to be alone in this
difficult undertaking. The world is watching the transformations
taking place here with sympathy and hope. The government will aim
energetically at obtaining as much economic support for Poland from
the international community as possible, in all possible forms,
according to existing procedures and customs.
   We will not apply for privileges denied others in a similar
situation to ours. We will, however, expect the maximum possible
support of our efforts to cure the economy. Governments by
themselves do not create economic success for their nations and do
not alone end economic crises.
   Many a government by stifling the initiative of citizens and
trying to direct everyone and everything effectively overpowered the
country economically. However, there have been and there are
governments that release the economic energy dormant in talented and
diligent people.

   Randy and Grace Quinones got married five
years ago after meeting on a commuter van they took to work each day.
   On Thursday they celebrated, with Mayor Tom Bradley, the 10th
anniversary of the van-pool program that shuttles more than 21
percent of the employees to and from the downtown TransAmerica
Center.
   ``It's good for everyone,'' Bradley said. ``You can read, sleep
... you can even propose for marriage if you like.''
   Quinones, 32, sporting a top hat, and his 31-year-old wife,
clutching a bouquet, said they met in 1981 when he was the
designated driver of the van she took each day from Ontario, about
35 miles east of downtown.
   He eyed her in the rearview mirror for about a month before he
got the nerve to ask her out on a date. Three years later, they were
married.
   The Quinoneses still live in Ontario and remain in the van pool.

   How about this name on a college
sweatshirt: ``Yosubacola.''
   It was one of several offered this week as Yuba College District
trustees discussed changing the district's name.
   ``We cover a large geographical area,'' said Patricia Wirth, the
superintendent who suggested a change because ``Yuba College does
not necessarily describe'' the district.
   Trustee Fred Mathews offered Yosubacola in jest, using two
letters from each of five counties the district covers: Yolo,
Sutter, Yuba, Colusa and Lake. The district also includes parts of
Butte, Glenn and Placer counties.
   Mathews said he offered the name because he was ``scared to death
someone's going to come up with a cutesy name.''
   One trustee suggested that any new name be higher in the alphabet.
   The trustees agreed to think about the proposal and discuss it
again.

   It may not help you in your next Trivial

the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's public relations
people:
   _ The Voyager mission has cost each U.S. resident 20 cents a year
since the project began in 1972. (That totals $865 million.)
   _ The two Voyager spacecraft have sent back 5 trillion bits of
scientific data, enough to fill 6,000 complete sets of the
Encyclopedia Brittanica.
   _ Each Voyager spacecraft has as many electronic components as
2,000 color televisions.
   _ The power it takes to operate a digital wristwatch is 20
billion times greater than the power of the Voyager radio signals
reaching Earth.
   _ An unprotected human riding on Voyager 1 would have received a
radiation dose 1,000 times the lethal level while passing Jupiter.
   _ The Voyager project has consumed 11,000 work years, one-third
what it took to build the great pyramid at Giza.
   _ Each Voyager spacecraft has a slight roll that engineers cannot
control. The roll is 15 times slower than the motion of a clock's
hour hand.
   _ When the Voyager spacecraft swept past Jupiter, they got an
energy boost and Jupiter suffered an energy loss, enough to slow its
motion by one foot in the next trillion years.
   _ Voyager gets 30,000 miles to the gallon.
   _ Pele, the largest volcano on Jupiter's moon Io, spews sulfur to
a height 30 times that of Mount Everest, and the fallout covers an
area the size of France.
   _ The Voyager spacecraft will leave the solar system in 20,000
years, at which time they will have traveled half the distance to
the nearest star.

   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a symbol
of the astounding change in the Communist world, has emerged as a
cautious, conciliatory negotiator who admits he is frightened by the
challenge ahead.
   ``A lot of things terrify me,'' he said as he paused after his
nomination last week to contemplate his momentous mission.
   The first non-Communist prime minister to head an East bloc
government, Mazowiecki faces awesome responsibility.
   He must negotiate the competing demands of factions long at
ideological odds while confronting economic disaster and inspiring a
populace that has exhausted its faith in government of any stripe.
   ``At first I felt as if someone had put 100 kilos of stones on my
head,'' Mazowiecki said. ``But I calmed down and started looking
with a certain optimism. Otherwise, I could not take on this role.''
   Mazowiecki was proposed as the head of a governing coalition by
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, for whom Mazowiecki has been a close
adviser since the founding of the independent union during shipyard
strikes in 1980.
   The 62-year-old lawyer and journalist, a lifelong anti-Communist
with close ties to the Roman Catholic Church, was not among the most
public Solidarity leaders. Nothing could have prepared him for the
hopes now centered on him.
   He has responded with remarkable calm. There have been no fiery
speeches, nor radical announcements. His diplomacy may smooth the
delicate transition, or it may disappoint those waiting to be
ignited.
   Although his demeanor has been mild, those who know him say he
can be tough.
   Mazowiecki's Solidarity activism earned him a year in prison
after the martial-law crackdown imposed in 1981 by Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the Communist president who nominated him as prime
minister Saturday.
   But associates say he was not embittered. His approach to the
weakened but still crucial Communist Party so far has been to play
down differences and offer compromise. There has been little sense
of triumph.
   ``I think we should be mutually open to each other, and aim at a
situation where no reluctance and aggression take place between us.
Because what Poland needs now is a joint effort of all forces,'' he
said after hearing of a sharply worded resolution from the party.
   To the Polish people, he has offered a mix of hope and realism,
asking them to ``believe that it can be better in this country''
while acknowledging: ``Society has no concept how difficult it will
be to reform this economy.''
   Graying and dignified, Mazowiecki appears solemn, serious and
even cool. But he has shown humor and a human side during the tense
week, joking about running out of gas while driving _ ``not fitting
for a premier'' _ and craving a cigarette away from the cameras.
   The widowed father of three sons who has four grandchildren,
Mazowiecki was editing Solidarity's weekly newspaper when history
turned to him. He had founded the newspaper during the union's first
legal months in 1980 and resurrected it when Solidarity was
legalized again in April.
   Walesa had entrusted him with a major role in the negotiations
between the opposition and the Communist authorities that led to
restoration of Solidarity's legal status and the freest parliament
elections in post-war Poland. He was in charge of the talks on trade
union issues.
   This spring, Mazowiecki chose to remain an editor rather than run
for the National Assembly.
   He had been a Sejm deputy from 1961 to 1970 as a member of ZNAK,
an officially condoned delegation under the church's protection that
supported regeneration of Poland based on Catholic values.
   In 1971, when he tried unsuccessfully to establish a Sejm
commission to study the violent repression of strikes that swept the
Baltic coast following price increases in December 1970, he
overstepped official tolerance and was denied another term.
   Born April 18, 1927, to an intelligentsia family in the small
central Poland city of Plock, Mazowiecki attended Warsaw University.
By age 21, in the early years of Communist Poland, he was dismissed
from his academic editing house job for links too close to the
church.
   He began to work for PAX, set up by the government to dilute
church-based opposition but one of the few venues for independent
thought. By 1955, he had been dismissed for criticizing the mix of
politics and religion.
   In 1958 he founded the Wiez, or Link, a progressive Catholic
monthly magazine that he edited until 1981.
   The Warsaw Club of Catholic Intelligentsia he helped found in
1957 became the core of the Catholic fight against to communist
ideology.
   On Aug. 22, 1980, he arrived at the strikebound Lenin Shipyard
and after a nightlong session with Walesa, he took charge of a group
of experts advising the workers on organizing the union.
   He stayed with Walesa and the movement through seven years of
resistance.
   In the Council of Minister building during his first hours as
prime minister, he recalled walking out of the Lenin Shipyard with
workers in disappoinment after an unfruitful occupation strike in
May 1988.
   ``I think that neither them nor I thought that exit would lead to
my entrance here today,'' he said.

<HEAD>Researchers Discover Gene for Cystic Fibrosis, May Suggest New Treatments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers who isolated the gene that causes
cystic fibrosis say the discovery may lead to breakthrough therapy
within the lifetimes of young people now suffering from the disease.
   ``This is a milestone of the highest order, but it does not have
applications for the doctor's office tomorrow,'' said Dr. Francis
Collins, a co-discoverer of the cystic fibrosis gene.
   Dr. Jack Riordan, director of the CF research program at the
Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute in Toronto, said that
finding the gene means that ``within the lifetime of CF sufferers,
we can now say it's possible that drugs will be discovered'' to
treat the fundamental condition causing the disease.
   Collins, of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich.; Riordan, and Lap-Chee
Tsui, also of the Toronto research institute, announced Thursday
they had isolated the gene responsible for CF.
   In cooperative research at labs in Michigan and Toronto, they
also discovered a mutation in the gene that causes production of a
defective protein that leads to symptoms of the disease.
   A report of their finding is to be published in the Sept. 8
edition of Science, the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   Robert K. Dresing, president of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
and father of Robbie, a 22-year-old with CF, said the discovery
gives a burst of hope for treatment of a disease that has been
largely untreatable.
   ``Now I can look in Robbie's eyes and say we going to cure this
disease and you will be a beneficiary,'' Dresing said at the news
conference. The remark received long applause from a audience that
included a number of cystic fibrosis patients and their parents.
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of
young people in North America, afflicting about 30,000. The Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md., said that 1,000 to 1,200 new
cases, usually children, are diagnosed annually.
   The disease causes the formation of a thick, sticky mucus that
clogs the lungs and digestive tract, blocking breathing and
digestion. Half of its victims die before their mid-20s.
   Treatment of the disease has been symptomatic, with drugs and
therapy designed to control the thick mucus and to help patients
avoid or combat repeated lung infections that often kill.
   Collins said treating the specific cause of the disease was
caught in a ``bottleneck'' because the precise gene and the flaw
that caused the disease were not known.
   ``That bottleneck has been passed through now,'' he said at a
news conference on Thursday.
   First use of the new knowledge, said Collins, will be to develop
a screening test to identify the 12 million or so Americans who
unknowingly carry the defective gene and can pass it along to their
offspring. He said about 5 percent of the white population are
carriers of the gene.
   CF occurs in a child only if it inherits two defective genes, one
from each parent. The parents can each carry one defective gene and
remain healthy, but there is a 25 percent chance that a child from
the couple will have CF.
   Collins said a genetic test could be developed to help couples
determine if their children were at risk of inheriting the CF gene.
   ``It's going to be possible and very soon,'' he said.
   Riordan said the researchers found a specific mutation in 70
percent of the chromosomes carrying the CF gene. This flaw, he said,
caused the gene to create a protein that lacks an amino acid called
phenylalanine.
   The flawed protein, now called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
regulator, somehow distorts the transport of charged particles
across the cell membranes of some organs. This, in turn, plays a
role in formation of the thick mucus.
   Riordan said the researchers now must determine the gene mutation
that causes the other 30 percent of CF-related problems.
   Once this is understood, he said, researchers may be able to
develop a therapy, perhaps some type of protein replacement, that
will correct the flawed mucus secretion.
   Ultimately, Collins said, the discovery of the defective gene may
help researchers correct the genetic flaw itself. This would mean
permanently fixing the defect within the gene so that it would start
producing the correct protein. Genes are segments within the
threadlike structures called chromosomes. The CF gene was found on
what is called chromosome 7.
   ``A gene therapy will take quite a bit of time (to develop),''
said Collins. ``That is a path that has never been trod before for
any disease.''

<HEAD>State Department Guides Diplomats on Sitting, Standing, Speaking</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department is advising its diplomats
that while they needn't splurge on their wardrobe for overseas duty,
shoes are a must.
   American women going abroad, as diplomats or their spouses, are
also advised to remove their gloves while eating or drinking at a
formal function.
   This is some of the advice in a pamphlet entitled ``Social Usage
Abroad'' given to U.S. representatives to help prepare them for
foreign postings.
   The leaflet illustrates how protocol, that French invention which
greases the wheels of statehood, can be a U.S. diplomat's biggest
nightmare. It also makes clear that proper behavior within the U.S.
diplomatic community abroad is just as tricky as behavior toward
officials of the host country.
   The diplomat's training begins well before departure from
Washington. ``It is customary when assigned to a U.S. mission abroad
to write to the principal officer (usually the ambassador) ... to
express personal pleasure in the assignment,'' the guide advises.
Wives (or husbands) of diplomats should do the same to the wife (or
husband) of the principal officer.
   A new member of the embassy staff must call on the ambassador or
chief officer within two working days, according to the manual.
   ``An expensive or extensive wardrobe is not necessary'' for
junior diplomats. ``It is advisable, however, for newcomers to bring
along a basic wardrobe, including shoes, because they will often be
too busy on arrival to shop for new clothes.''
   As for the dress code: for a daytime ceremony, ``a woman's
shoulders should be covered.'' And in countries where gloves are
worn for all daytime social occasions, ``it is useful to remember
that they are always removed entirely for eating or drinking.''
   Ambassadors, in addition to familiarizing themselves with
treaties and other aspects of bilateral relations, must remember to
take the place closest to the curbside when entering a car.
   When making social calls on officials of the host country in
their homes, the American's calling card is left on a hall table
``and a caller should stay no longer than 20 minutes unless strongly
urged.'' The pamphlet doesn't explain how to judge whether such
entreaties are ``strong.''
   What it does do is answer every question ``ever put to us,'' said
Nancy Forbord, relocation adviser for the Overseas Briefing Center.
The center, run by the State Department's Foreign Service Institute,
provides extensive reading materials on conditions in foreign
countries, regulations of the U.S. foreign service, etiquette,
educational and health facilities, and other information.
   Some 14,000 people, or about half of the Americans sent abroad
last year by various government agencies, used the center in 1988,
she said. The center also offers a mandatory two-day seminar on
security overseas, and even a course designed to help teenagers
adjust to life abroad, Forbord said.
   For American hostesses abroad, the pitfalls are numerous. Making
a dinner table seating plan is ``full of complexities,'' warn the
authors of the pamphlet. Hostesses should check with the embassy
protocol officer to ensure they have not inadvertently planned to
seat together people from countries which do not maintain diplomatic
relations, for example.
   A proper seating arrangement requires mathematical talent. ``To
seat eight, 12, 16 or 20 persons without two men or two women
sitting together, the hostess sits to the left of the seat that is
properly hers.'' Is that clear?
   Now, if the women are served before the men, the woman on the
host's right is served first and the woman on the host's left is
served second. Try explaining that to the servants.
   One also should be aware that an invitation for 8 o'clock doesn't
necessarily mean you show up at 8. In some countries, it's a signal
to turn up at 9:30.
   ``At official dinners in certain Commonwealth countries, it is
rude to smoke at the table before the toast to the Queen.'' And
speaking of toasts, ``it is a good idea to leave enough wine in the
glass at the end of the meal to join in the drinking'' of such
salutations.
   And in case your parents neglected to tell you, the guide advises
that ``before leaving, each guest should thank those hosting the
party.''
   Then there are ambiguities. For instance, men always rise when
being introduced and when a woman enters the room. But ``whether a
woman rises to be introduced to another woman is a more complicated
question'' depending on age, social position, etc. The guide,
however, doesn't advise whether a woman should rise when being
introduced to a man. Emily Post, help!

<TEXT>
   It's a quintessentially South
African paradox. Johannesburg Girls High School has been ordered
closed for lack of pupils, yet its neighborhood abounds with
schoolgirls who wish they could enroll.
   Throughout its 102-year existence, the inner-city school has been
open only to whites. Now, with closure imminent because of white
flight to the suburbs, its students, teachers and parents are
petitioning for it to become South Africa's first multiracial
government-run school.
   ``We should prove to the rest of the world we can do it,'' said
Candice Bond, a 15-year-old student excited by the idea of black
classmates. ``Our school should feel privileged if it could be the
first.''
   The government has given no sign it will be swayed by the ``Save
Our School'' campaign, even though organizers say they have gathered
12,000 signatures supporting integration at the city's oldest high
school.
   But Sharon Bond, mother of Candice and chairman of the campaign,
says she hopes that mounting pressure might prompt the government to
reconsider its decision to close the school in December.
   On a brick wall at the school was a poster with the initials
S.O.S. _ for ``Save Our School'' _ and a crayon drawing showing a
white girl and black girl side by side, dressed in the school's
uniform.
   The school was built to accommodate 630 students, and now has
203. It is in the heart of the country's largest ``gray area,''
where thousands of black and Indian families have moved in defiance
of residential segregation laws.
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk, favored to win a full five-year
term after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, says he opposes
discrimination and favors legalization of selected multiracial
neighborhoods. But he has recommitted himself to the concept of
segregated public schools.
   Asked about Johannesburg Girls High School, he said children
should have ``mother-tongue education among people of their own
community.''
   Parents who wanted multiracial education could send their
children to integrated, state-subsidized private schools, de Klerk
said.
   But Mrs. Bond said most girls at the high school were from
low-income or single-parent families and could not afford the cost
of private schools.
   The parent-elected management council at Johannesburg Girls High
has been criticized by some parents for failing to consult the
school community fully before it advised the government to either
integrate the facility or close it.
   But council chairman Jack Foster said the declining enrollment
left no other option.
   ``It wasn't educationally viable anymore,'' he said. ``We
couldn't offer the variety of subjects you need in a high school
like that.''
   ``It's a great, great pity,'' he added. ``The facilities are all
there. It seems crazy not to utilize them.''
   The school is a spacious complex of modern red-brick buildings on
the border of Hillbrow and Berea, two neighborhoods dominated by
high-rise apartment buildings. They officially are designated as
``whites only,'' but an estimated 60,000 blacks, Indians and people
of mixed race have moved in and the government has virtually halted
enforcement of residential segregation laws in the area.
   However, no state schools have been established for these
non-white families. Their children must either go to costly private
schools or commute long distances to crowded, poorly equipped public
schools in outlying townships.
   Mrs. Bond said some black children spend nearly four hours daily
commuting to and from schools in Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg.
   If it closes, Johannesburg Girls High could be the first of many.
A new study by education specialists at Johannesburg's University of
the Witwatwersrand said 42 of the city's 175 white schools are at
risk of closure within five years because of declining enrollments.
   The study calculated that there were 13,150 vacant places for
students in the city's schools.

<HEAD>Monkeys Lose Cocaine Interest After Buprenorphine Shots, Researcher
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pain-reliever that causes laboratory monkeys
to lose interest in cocaine may now be tested to see if it can help
human addicts lose the craving for drugs, researchers say in an
article published today.
   Researchers at a Harvard Medical School drug abuse research
center report that five Rhesus monkeys that had been dosing
themselves regularly with cocaine chose to ignore the drug after
receiving injections of buprenorphine. The study appears in the
journal Science.
   Dr. Jack H. Mendelson, a co-investigator in the research, said as
a result of the animals' response to buprenorphine, clinical studies
are proposed to determine if the analgesic will help people overcome
dependence on cocaine and heroin.
   ``We feel that it (buprenorphine) may provide an opportunity for
some persons to stop using cocaine and not feel the adverse effects
of cessation,'' Mendelson said in a telephone interview. ``This
would provide a window in time for someone who might be able to stop
using the drug and ultimately become drug-free.''
   In the laboratory studies, five Rhesus monkeys were fitted with
intravenous catheters that were connected to pumps operated by
levers. Each monkey, if it chose to, could press the lever and
receive a small dose of cocaine.
   ``The monkeys self-administer cocaine, but are under no
compulsion to do so,'' Mendelson said. ``It is completely an
elective act.''
   He said earlier studies showed that when given this choice, nine
out of 10 Rhesus monkeys will press the lever for cocaine, though
they will choose not to self-administer some other types of
pharmaceuticals.
   Mendelson said that when the five test monkeys received
injections of buprenorphine, their cocaine use rapidly declined, and
approached zero use at some doses of the buprenorphine.
   When a type of placebo, saline solution, was injected, the
monkeys chose to press the cocaine lever repeatedly.
   ``The placebo didn't do anything,'' Mendelson said. ``But the
buprenorphine suppressed the cocaine self-administration.''
   At the same time, he said, the monkeys continued to press another
lever to receive banana pellets, and otherwise behaved normally
while taking the buprenorphine.
   ``It doesn't produce the behavior changes and its safety is
enormous,'' said the researcher.
   Mendelson said buprenorphine may be particularly useful in
weaning abusers away from ``speedball,'' a combination of heroin and
cocaine that is becoming more widely used by drug-dependent people.
   ``We've tried (buprenorphine) in heroin-dependent persons and
most of them report they can detect that they've had a drug, but it
doesn't produce the degree of euphoria and certainly not the rush of
a drug like heroin or methadone,'' he said. ``Most of the people who
are heroin-dependent who have used the drug report that they don't
feel high, but they feel normal.''
   The factors of drug addiction are highly complex and stopping
dependence is not easy, Mendelson said. Though it appears that
buprenorphine would not become a ``substitute addiction'' for
cocaine, he said, it does not represent a ``magic bullet'' for the
effortless control of substance abuse, but possibly only an aide for
controlling such dependence.
   ``Some people,'' he noted, ``will abuse chicken soup.''
   Buprenorphine is commonly used in Britain for relief of moderate
pain, and is used in U.S. hospitals as an injectable pain reliever.
Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals Inc. markets it as the prescription
drug Buprenex.
   The Rhesus monkey study was coauthored by Mendelson, Nancy K.
Mello, Mark P. Bree and Scott E. Lukas, all researchers at the
Harvard Medical School-McLean Hospital drug abuse research center in
Belmont, Mass.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Pentagon Provides List of Possible Hardware for Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff have sent the White
House a list of military hardware that President Bush could send to
Colombia if that country seeks such aid in its war against drugs,
sources say.
   The Joint Chiefs met Thursday to draw up the list, which includes
UH-1 ``Huey'' troop transport helicopters, ammunition and radio
equipment, said a military source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Top U.S. and Colombian officials were expected to meet in
Washington to discuss how the two nations can cooperate in the
anti-drug battle.
   An administration source, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, stressed that no U.S. military personnel were included in
the Joint Chiefs' suggestions.
   This, he said, was in line with Bush's complaint that talk of
such an idea had gotten ``out of whack.''
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco has also rejected the idea of
seeking U.S. troops.
   The administration official said Bush could do other things to
help Colombia in its battle against drug terrorists _ such as
offering training to members of the Colombian military and police
forces. But, he cautioned, ``we aren't going to do anything unless
the Colombians say they want it.''
   The military source said the U.S. helicopters _ which were widely
used in the Vietnam war and are being replaced by the more
sophisticated Blackhawk choppers _ must be flown by Colombian pilots
since no U.S. personnel will be involved.
   No precise numbers were disclosed, but the source said the amount
of helicopters that could be provided was ``not extravagant.''
   The administration source said the list was not a formal
recommendation, but instead provides the president with ``a laundry
list of items that the Pentagon could provide if called upon to do
so.''
   The official said the Pentagon's suggestions came amid those
offered by other agencies, such as a $2 million Justice Department
program designed to help Colombia protect judges and other officials
threatened by the drug cartel.
   The military source noted that the Joint Chiefs' list is over and
above the aid provided to Colombia through the Foreign Military
Sales program.
   Under the FMS program, the Defense Department has sold Colombia's
government almost $210 million worth of military goods and services
since 1963, Pentagon officials said Thursday.
   The focus of the sales have been the helicopters, ammunition,
spare parts and support for the choppers.
   The Colombian government has requested that the Export-Import
Bank provide a loan guarantee for approximately $200 million, and
the proceeds of loans obtained under the guarantee would finance
additional FMS purchases for the counter-narcotics programs, the
Pentagon said.
   Colombia is expected to purchase additional UH-60 and UH-1
helicopters, patrol boats, rifles, machine guns, ammunition,
vehicles and spare parts as part of this program, the Pentagon said.
   In the 1988 fiscal year, a total of 775 Colombian military
personnel were trained under the International Military Education
and Training program, while 898 Colombian military received such
training so far this fiscal year, the Pentagon said.

   Amal Aruri steeled herself
for the worst but still found she was unprepared when the Israeli
Supreme Court ordered her husband deported to Lebanon.
   ``We fought it for more a year,'' Mrs. Aruri said, her voice
shaking. ``Even though I expected it day by day, still I was
shocked.''
   The 28-year-old Palestinian nursery school teacher learned from
Israeli radio news that an appeal by her husband, physics professor
Taysir Aruri, was rejected by the court Thursday. He is accused of
being a leader of the Palestinian uprising.
   The deportation order is expected to be carried out within a week
and could mean a long separation for the family. Mrs. Aruri has no
passport and fears she will not get special travel passes from the
Israeli military government.
   ``I haven't told the children yet,'' she said in an interview,
adding she was waiting ``until we can sit alone together ... maybe
at bedtime.''
   On Thursday, the sitting room in the family's white stone house
was crowded with relatives who came to lend support and distract the
three Aruri children, ages 2 to 7, while Mrs. Aruri talked with
lawyers and reporters.
   Taysir Aruri, a 43-year-old physicist at the West Bank's Bir Zeit
University, was served on Aug. 17, 1988, with a deportation order
signed by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   He has been jailed since in Juneid Prison near Nablus.
   Aruri was never tried but was accused by the army of being a
member of the outlawed Palestinian Communist Party and of being
``involved in planning the intefadeh and a member of the unified
command of the intefadeh.''
   ``Intefadeh'' is the Arabic word for the uprising Palestinians
have been waging since December 1987 against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Supreme Court does not hear arguments in deportation cases
and only decides if the army acted properly. The court has never
overturned a deportation order.
   London-based Amnesty International has adopted Aruri as a
``prisoner of conscience,'' and hundreds of scientists in America,
Canada and Europe signed petitions and launched a letter-writing
campaign on his behalf.
   ``Maybe they didn't know they were dealing with a very cold
government here,'' Mrs. Aruri said.
   Her husband was one of four Palestinians whose petitions were
rejected Thursday. The others are Odeh Yusef Maali and Majed Labadi,
both union organizers, and Mohammed Matur, a teacher. Labidi's
brother, Mohammed, also a union leader, was expelled in June.
   The new expulsions to Lebanon will raise the number of deportees
to 59.
   The United States, the United Nations and international human
rights groups have said repeatedly that the practice violates
international law.
   This was not Aruri's first run-in with Israeli authorities. He
was jailed from 1974 to 1978 without charge or trial under Israeli
administrative detention procedures. Then, too, he was championed by
Amnesty International.
   Asked about the allegation that her husband is a leader of the
uprising, Mrs. Aruri said: ``I think every Palestinian is a leader
of the intefadeh. It doesn't depend on leaders, really, since it is
a popular revolution.''
   Petitions on Aruri's behalf, including one signed by nearly 1,000
foreign scientists and published in the English-language Jerusalem
Post in May, describe him as ``a man of peace.''
   An outspoken critic of the occupation, Aruri has urged an
international conference leading to creation of a separate
Palestinian state beside Israel, an idea long opposed by Israel's
government.
   Two months before he was arrested, Aruri joined other prominent
Palestinian and Israeli artists and intellectuals in signing a
``peace treaty'' calling for dialogue. He has argued that there can
be no military solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Mrs. Aruri said the couple's children knew their father might be
deported to Lebanon.
   Natasha, the 5-year-old, often asked during weekly prison visits
about his future: ``Can we come to visit you? ... When will you come
home?''
   ``Right now I don't have answers for her,'' Mrs. Aruri said.

   Things are so bad for U.S. policy in Panama
that the State Department official assigned to that issue, Lawrence
Eagleburger, is being dubbed by irreverent colleagues as the
``deputy secretary for disasters.''
   Eighteen months have passed since the United States began its
effort to dislodge Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power. But it
seemed easier to negotiate the departure of 100,000 Soviet troops
from Afghanistan than it has been to uproot a single Panamanian.
   Elsewhere in the world the picture looks much more promising for
administration policy. The Soviet empire, for example, has shown
clear signs of unraveling, but Noriega continues to reign in Panama,
smugly defying the wishes of his opponents in Washington.
   The Organization of American States has held four foreign
ministers' meetings on Panama. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
attended the first but assigned the following three to Eagleburger,
the State Department's second-ranking official.
   It has been a thankless task.
   Under heavy U.S. prodding, the OAS in May held Noriega
responsible for the ``grave events'' surrounding national elections,
in which opposition candidates were deprived of an apparent victory
and then beaten by government agents days later.
   The OAS statement encouraged U.S. officials but as time passed,
the number of countries willing to take a strong stand against
Noriega steadily diminished.
   Among others, Mexico felt that the principles of non-intervention
should outweigh all other considerations in dealing with internal
problems in member states.
   More than any other country, Mexico knows the price of foreign
interventionism, having lost half its territory 140 years ago to its
powerful northern neighbor. There was no OAS at the time to put a
brake on U.S. territorial ambitions.
   There was not much left of the anti-Noriega indignation by the
time the OAS ministers convened this week for the fourth time to
discuss the Panama situation.
   Indeed, OAS mediators given the task of promoting a democratic
transfer of power in Panama issued a report that left State
Department officials gasping in disbelief.
   The report, far from criticizing Noriega, did not even mention
him by name and instead concluded that the blame for the lack of
progress rested with none other than the Bush administration.
   The study said U.S. military maneuvers in Panama had a ``negative
effect'' on the negotiating process and were ``inopportune.''
   In response, the administration acknowledged that the maneuvers
did indeed take place but were consistent with U.S. treaty
responsibilities to protect the Panama Canal.
   In private, officials expressed incredulity that the mediators
were unwilling to take a more assertive stance against a strongman
who, they alleged, stole an election, tramples on the human rights
of his people and does business with Colombian drug dealers and
leftist guerrillas in that country.
   Panama has its list of grievances against the United States,
accusing the administration of trifling with Panama's sovereign
rights through a variety of coercive measures, including economic
sanctions. As Panama sees it, U.S. military maneuvers are aimed less
at protecting the canal than intimidating Noriega.
   Not surprisingly, feelings were running high Wednesday and early
Thursday morning when the OAS foreign ministers assembled to discuss
the situation.
   Eagleburger, reaching deep into his rhetorical bag, likened
Noriega to Adolf Hitler and said the Panamanian runs an ``outlaw
regime.''
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter stormed out of the
meeting hall during Eagleburger's presentation, leaving a deputy,
Romulo Escobar Betancourt, to rebut.
   For two hours, Escobar ranted about U.S. predatory activities and
challenged Eagleburger to prove his allegations about Noriega's role
in drug smuggling.
   But Eagleburger had long since left his seat and was seen
stalking the hallway, smoking a cigarette, his translation device
nowhere in sight.
   It was 2:30 a.m., and Eagleburger had the look of a man who
wished he were elsewhere.

<HEAD>Contra Appeals Court Rules on Torture-Murder Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Contra spokesman predicts the State
Department will object to a rebel appeals court decision that
exonerates a top commander found guilty in March of covering up a
murder.
   The Contra court, made up of four civilian lawyers living in
Miami, also upheld the conviction of one Contra commander and
reduced charges against four others in a torture-murder case, rebel
spokesman Bosco Matamoros said Thursday.
   Five of the six Contras were given dishonorable discharges _ the
stiffest penalty that can be handed out by the Contra internal court
system that was set up in 1987. Leniency was recommended for one,
according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.
   It could not be independently confirmed if the expulsions were
carried out.
   Meanwhile, the rebels fired their chief representative in
Washington, Ernesto Palazio, charging him with abuses of Contra
funds that Matamoros said could run into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars. Palazio, believed to be in Miami, could not immediately
be reached for comment.
   A 1986 law prohibits U.S.-supplied aid to any group that includes
a person ``found to engage in gross violations of internationally
recognized human rights.''
   A State Department official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the appeal would be reviewed.
   ``If they are guilty and maintained in the resistance, that
creates a problem,'' the official said. ``We will review the verdict
of the appeals tribunal and see what procedures were followed and
how they arrived at their decision.''
   Matamoros said he expected the State Department to object to the
dismissal of charges that Commander Mack, the chief of intelligence
for the Contras, covered up a murder. Mack was a member of the
national guard under the late Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Mack reportedly violated a State Department order that he be
suspended from his duties until after the appeal.
   The Contra tribunal found that rebel commander Isaac Blacker
Hurtado, known as Israelita, ``had the premeditated intention of
murdering Managua 2,'' a man who was killed in November 1988.
   The victim was suspected of being an agent of Nicaragua's
Sandinista government. The six Contras were charged in March by a
Contra court in connection with the murder and several rapes in
northern Nicaragua. The United States pressed for the investigation.
   The lawyers upheld charges of torture and cruel and inhuman
punishment against Israelita, as well as Contras known as Rambo,
Pandillero, Ali and Nolan. The judges recommended leniency for
Nolan, saying he joined the Contra ranks at age 15 and lost an eye
in the fight.
   The rebels, backed by the United States since 1981, have been
fighting to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua. Matamoros said he did not know the whereabouts of the
expelled commanders but believed they were in Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Forecasters Say Utilities Must Build Many More Power Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electric utilities in the coming decade will
have to build at least twice as much generating capacity as
previously planned to meet the nation's growing appetite for
electricity, an industry group says.
   In an otherwise bright outlook for energy supplies and prices,
the Gas Research Institute said Thursday that the Northeast will
face a serious squeeze in electricity.
   ``The likelihood of a shortfall in electric utility generating
capacity, particularly in the near term, to the year 2000 and
through the 1990s, is very high,'' said Daniel Dreyfus, the group's
vice president for strategic planning and analysis.
   He said an electricity pinch in New England was ``now virtually
unavoidable,'' because demand would outstrip supply before new power
plants can be built.
   Even if the nation's electricity use grows relatively slowly to
2000, electric utilities will have to build at least 45 gigawatts of
new capacity _ roughly equivalent to 45 new large-scale power plants
_ beyond the 46 gigawatts of capacity already on the drawing board,
the report said.
   The research group, sponsored by natural gas pipeline and
distribution companies, also said the big increase in world oil
prices that many forecasters have projected for the mid-1990s is
unlikely to hit before the turn of the century.
   A key reason for expecting a longer period of stable prices, it
said, is that oil production in high-cost fields, such as the North
Sea, has remained strong. Some high-cost production has been lost _
particularly in the United States _ but the overall decline has been
smaller than expected after the 1986 price crash.
   Oil prices by 1995 are likely to be about $18 a barrel in current
dollars, rising to about $20 a barrel by 2000, the group said. Oil
is selling for about $18 a barrel, up from about $15 a barrel last
year.
   A faster price escalation is likely after the turn of the
century, Dreyfus said, as world oil demand moves closer into balance
with available supplies. The forecast said the price, in current
dollars, would be about $32 a barrel in 2010.
   Low oil prices during the 1990s imply a generally stable price
for all types of energy, including natural gas, coal and products
made from oil, such as gasoline, the forecast said. This is because
oil is the most versatile and dominant energy source.
   The report also said U.S. oil imports would reach 13.4 million
barrels a day by 2010, nearly double the current rate and meeting
about two-thirds of total U.S. oil needs.

<HEAD>Lingering Drought Draining Grain Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's lingering drought in major wheat
areas continues to drain U.S. grain reserves and push up market
prices, the Agriculture Department says in a new analysis.
   Moreover, the department's Economic Research Service said
Thursday, world stockpiles are in similar shape, with wheat reserves
the lowest since the mid-1970s.
   The analysis was based on the Aug. 10 estimate that wheat
production would be about 2.04 billion bushels, up 13 percent from
the 1988 harvest.
   Wheat use, including exports, is expected to be 2.29 billion
bushels in the marketing year that began June 1, down 5 percent from
1988-89.
   ``With U.S. farm prices expected near the target price ($4 per
bushel) in 1989-90, and increased competitor supplies, exports may
decline more than 10 percent to less than 1.3 billion bushels,'' the
report said. ``The U.S. share of world trade is expected to slip as
well.''
   At the end of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year, the United States
had about 694 million bushels from previous harvests in its
stockpile. And this June 1 ``carryover'' was down from more than
1.26 billion bushels a year earlier.
   By next June 1, the report said, the wheat stockpile will be
trimmed further to an estimated 474 million bushels, down more than
30 percent and the smallest carryover since 1974-75.
   Most of the reduction will occur in the inventories held by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp. as forfeited collateral for
price support loans made to producers. Other reductions will be in
the ``farmer-owned reserve'' of wheat stored under loan and released
to the market as prices rise and the loans become due.
   ``Area planted increased 17 percent in response to attractive
prices and less acreage idled under annual government programs, but
yields are forecast to be the lowest since 1978'' because of
lingering drought in major wheat production areas, the report said.
   Because of the continued tight wheat supply, the government has
lowered the land-idling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent of the
base acreage, down from 10 percent for 1989 and 27.5 percent in
1988. That is land farmers must take from production to qualify for
federal supports.
   Wheat prices are projected to average in the range of $3.85 to
$4.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, up from $3.72
estimated for 1988-89.
   ``The global wheat situation is similar to the U.S.,'' the report
said. ``World production is forecast up 26.5 million tons to 527
million metric tons in 1989-90. However, consumption is expected to
outpace production for the third consecutive year, reducing stocks
to their lowest since 1975-76.''
   Relatively high export prices are expected, but ``world demand
for imported wheat is likely to remain strong,'' the report said.

   Egg production continues to drop, meaning
higher prices for consumers, according the latest Agriculture
Department estimates.
   July production was 5.63 billion eggs, down 2 percent from a year
earlier, a report said Thursday. Production included 4.89 billion
eggs for the table and 738 million for hatching.
   As of Aug. 1, the laying flock was about 264.2 million birds,
down 2 percent from a year ago.
   However, production averaged 68.1 eggs per 100 birds, virtually
the same as a year earlier, the report said.
   The department's Economic Research Service says in a related
report that total egg production this year is expected to decline
about 2 percent. The agency earlier forecast a 3 percent drop, but
``net returns continue to be positive and are likely to remain so
for the rest of the year.''
   As a result, ``flock rebuilding is expected to bring about a
larger-than-expected increase in table egg production during the
fourth quarter,'' the report said.
   Egg production in the third quarter of this year is expected to
be only about 1 percent below a year ago, and may increase about 1
percent from a year earlier during the fourth quarter.
   Wholesale egg prices are up sharply from a year ago and should
maintain their strength through September before coming down in the
fourth quarter as supplies increase.
   The agency predicts that 1989 consumer prices of eggs will
average 15 percent to 20 percent higher than in 1988, when prices
gained 2.3 percent. Retail egg prices dropped 5.9 percent in 1987
and then began climbing as financially pressed producers cut back on
flocks.
   Retail egg prices had increased 6.9 percent in 1986, after a 16.6
percent plummet in 1985.

   The minister won't have to tell Lloyd Gubler he
may kiss the bride when he and his fiancee get married at noon
Saturday.
   Gubler, 23, and Laura Bradley, 25, both of Reno, have had their
lips locked at least 12 hours a day since Aug. 12 as contestants in
the Great Amercian Kiss-Off Contest in a furniture store's parking
lot.
   Gubler, an auto body shop foreman, and Ms. Bradley, who works in
a retail store, said Thursday the only thing that worries them about
tying the knot during the contest is that the vows won't be read
fast enough.
   ``We're concerned about the time factor since we only receive
five minutes per hour break time,'' Gubler said in between smooches.
   The couple is trying to accumulate break time for the wedding
ceremony; but if they must, they'll just say muffled ``I dos'' with
lips touching.
   Under rules of the contest, in its 14th day, couples must kiss
for 12 hours a day, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
   Marsha Thomas, spokeswoman for the contest, quipped that the
official who conducts the wedding will probably tell the couple,
``You may kiss the bride _ for another 30 days in a row.''
   Gubler and Ms. Bradley are one of six hardy couples among a
starting 15 who are still in the contest, which has become more than
a lark for those counting on the $10,000 top prize.
   ``There are some people competing out here who really need the
money,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``Right now, it appears that the six
couples left will go on forever.''
   Menette McVey, 19, of Reno, won't be able to last too long,
however. She's nearly eight months pregnant and is relying on the
$10,000 to pay hospitals bills when she gives birth.
   In applying to enter the contest, Ms. McVey and Jason Knapp, 20,
her kissing partner and father of the baby, both simply put ``baby''
for the reason why they entered the contest.
   Contestant Lori Block, 25, of Reno, lost her bank job this week
because the contest was going on too long, said Butch Lynn,
spokesman for the Kiss-Off. She's counting on the money to use
during a job search.
   ``I guess she didn't tell the bank she was going to enter this
until about a week before and they weren't too happy,'' Lynn said.
   Her partner, Bret Watson, 26, is a financial planner and
apparently is making good use of his kissing time by plotting ways
to make money. He's reading ``Think and Grow Rich'' among other
books.

<HEAD>Fed Allows Bank Holding Companies to Buy Healthy S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unanimous Federal Reserve vote allowing bank
holding companies to buy healthy thrifts is being described as
``another nail in the coffin'' of an independent savings and loan
industry.
   Still, the decision was widely expected after enactment two weeks
ago of S&amp;L bailout legislation, and thrift officials are looking on
the bright side.
   The 6-0 ruling Thursday will bring more money from commercial
banks into the troubled savings business.
   ``The healthy institutions are happy to have more people
interested in their stock,'' said Dennis J. Jacobe, research
director of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, which opposed
the rule when it was proposed two years ago.
   Under the federal regulatory scheme, banks and savings
associations were kept strictly separate until 1982, when Congress
decided to allow bank holding companies to buy ailing thrifts.
   In September 1987, the Fed proposed opening all thrifts to
purchase by banks but delayed its decision after it ran into a
barrage of criticism from S&amp;Ls, small banks and members of Congress.
   When the Bush administration originally drafted its S&amp;L bill six
months ago, it had called for a two-year delay before banks could
buy healthy S&amp;Ls on the theory that banks wouldn't want to buy
ailing thrifts if they had the chance to buy sound institutions.
   But Congress scrapped the waiting period in an effort to entice
banks into investing in marginal, but still solvent, savings
associations.
   James R. Barth, chief economist of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, says solvent S&amp;Ls will have to raise $30 billion to
meet new capital requirements going into effect by the end of the
year.
   He estimated that half of the approximately 2,600 solvent S&amp;Ls in
the nation, representing 85 percent of the industry's assets, fall
short of the new standard.
   However, critics warn that thrifts owned by banks may
de-emphasize home mortgage lending and eventually convert to banks.
   ``This just adds another nail to the coffin ... of a separate
thrift industry,'' said Diane Casey, director of regulatory affairs
for the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents
community banks.
   The independent bankers also complain that the decision is a
back-door method of allowing companies such as Citicorp, the
nation's largest banking company, to circumvent state laws that
protect their banks from out-of-state takeovers.
   ``This is going to substantially broaden interstate banking. We
believe that should be a state decision, not a federal decision,''
Casey said.
   The Fed, however, says only four states _ Iowa, Kansas, Montana
and North Dakota _ ban interstate banking.
   ``It does have the tendency to accelerate the pace of interstate
banking,'' said board member John P. LaWare. ``But I think that is
happening in any case.''
   James D. McLaughlin of the American Bankers Association, which
had pushed for the change, welcomed the Fed ruling but quarreled
with a provision that will prevent bank holding companies from
acquiring thrift subsidiaries that sell insurance or invest in real
estate.
   Those are areas prohibited to banks, but not S&amp;L subsidiaries.
   ``There's nothing in here that alters in any way the separation
of commercial activity and industrial activity from banking,'' said
board member Wayne D. Angell.
   In related action earlier this week, the Fed lifted so-called
``tandem operating restrictions,'' which had prevented Citicorp and
Michigan National Corp. from fully integrating S&amp;Ls they owned in
California, Illinois and Florida into their banking operations.

   Three days ago, Bradford Smith stood
before 150 reporters, squinted into the glare of television lights,
and said he'd been wrong.
   He pointed to a picture from Voyager 2 of one of Neptune's
partial rings, or ring arcs.
   ``It seemed reasonable that this was the lost arc that our
imaging team raiders were looking for,'' he said.
   Reporters had already said so in their stories and broadcasts.
   But the arc that had disappeared from some earlier pictures and
been rediscovered wasn't an arc at all. ``It goes all the way
around,'' Smith said.
   Reporters rushed to correct their stories to say that Neptune's
first ring had been found.
   ``Now you're going to turn on me, right?'' Smith said.
   He was suffering the perils of what scientists at National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
call ``instant science.''
   ``We have to think on our feet,'' Smith said Thursday. ``We see
things in the images and we try to tell you what we think we see.
When the images get better, we have to go even faster.''
   Smith's job is complicated by the swift delivery of information
to the press. Monitors in the press room at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory show reporters raw images from the spacecraft at the same
time the scientists see them.
   When interesting features appear on the television monitors,
reporters want interpretations right away. Sometimes the scientists
themselves, busy with countless mission-related chores, haven't seen
the latest images. Often they haven't had time to decide what the
images show.
   Smith's unhappy experience with the ring occurred at a Tuesday
morning news briefing. Much the same thing happened to Voyager
scientists again Thursday, when they stumbled over reports that the
spacecraft was about to enter Neptune's magnetic field.
   Douglas Griffith, deputy mission manager, told reporters early in
the day that the spacecraft had crossed a supersonic shock wave
surrounding Neptune's magnetic field and was about to enter the
field itself.
   In fact, the spacecraft crossed the shock wave once, then the
shock wave moved, and the spacecraft crossed it again, Griffith said.
   Two hours later, scientists reported that the shock wave had not
been crossed. Not until afternoon did Voyager's magnetic field team
pop champagne corks and report that the shock wave had definitely
been crossed.
   ``It's not the fault of the media,'' Smith said. ``We understand
there's a lot of public interest. The American people paid for this
and they want to know what they're getting for their buck.''
   The first solid analysis of the Voyager data will not appear
until sometime in January when the so-called 30-day report of the
mission is published in a scientific journal. The name comes from a
time when missions were simple enough that it was possible to
analyze all the data in 30 days, Smith said.
   Even that report, coming five months or so after the mission,
will not be final, he said. Voyager science teams will work for
another year to process most of the remaining data.
   Other scientists will then take that data and continue for many
years to come, hoping to extract even more information. Voyager
passed Jupiter in 1979, Smith said, and ``people are still
publishing results from Jupiter.''

<HEAD>Demery Approved HUD Subsidies for Boston Project after Recusing Himself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly released documents show that a top HUD
official in the Reagan administration removed himself from dealing
with a Boston housing project in 1988 but approved a $51 million
federal subsidy for it two months later.
   ``Please let this memorandum serve as a formal notification of my
recusal in all matters arising from and pertaining to'' developer
Arthur D. Winn, Thomas T. Demery, who was Housing and Urban
Development assistant secretary for housing, said in July 1988 memo
about the Castle Square project in Boston's South End.
   However, Demery signed a Sept. 30, 1988, memo announcing a $51.2
million grant to the project.
   The recusal memo was among Demery's files, which were opened to
the media Thursday in response to a Freedom of Information request.
Demery, now a private consultant, is under scrutiny in the probe of
alleged fraud, abuse and mismanagement at HUD during the Reagan
years.
   Demery's files also revealed that he was lobbying in late 1988 to
be named HUD secretary, even while he was under investigation by
HUD's inspector general.
   Winn, a Massachusetts developer who owns the Bostonian Hotel, was
under contract in 1988 to buy Castle Square from Ronald Drucker.
Both men contributed to Demery's pet charity, F.O.O.D. for Africa,
with Winn holding a fund-raiser at his hotel, according to an
internal HUD investigation released earlier this year.
   HUD's inspector general concluded that Demery may have misused
his position to induce contractors seeking HUD-subsidized business
to contribute to the charity, but the Justice Department said last
month that it saw no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
   In the memo released Thursday, Demery wrote to HUD's Under
Secretary Carl D. Covitz:
   ``The circumstances leading up to this decision to recuse myself
are nebulous at best; I think I would rather err on the side of
conservative safety, lest any appearance problem unnecessarily
occur.''
   Demery could not be reached for comment Thursday. A woman
answering his phone said he was on vacation.
   Winn was traveling on business, and Drucker had gone for the day
and could not be reached, their offices said Thursday.
   Demery is a former Michigan real estate agent and mortgage broker
who worked in Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. As
assistant housing secretary, he administered several of HUD's
biggest programs, including $225 million in moderate-rehabilitation
funds awarded annually and the massive Federal Housing
Administration's mortgage insurance program.
   The rehabilitation program has been revealed to be governed by
influence-peddling while the FHA has been losing millions of dollars
annually through loan defaults and mismanagement.
   In his campaign to be named HUD secretary, Demery sent a Dec. 7
form letter to several members of Congress and a Bush transition
official asking for their support and seeking meetings to discuss
his qualifications.
   The position went to former Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.

<HEAD>Judge Halts $1 Billion Government Contract for Nuclear Dump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says the Energy Department must
award a $1 billion contract for a high-level nuclear waste dump in
Nevada to a company that sued the agency on the grounds the
selection process was improper.
   U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson, in a ruling that has set
back the government's problem-ridden nuclear waste program, said
Thursday that the department could give the 10-year contract only to
TRW Inc., an unsuccessful bidder that filed the December lawsuit.
   The department said it was disappointed about the ruling, but
stressed that the decision did not stop preliminary work to
determine the site's suitability.
   The project has been beset with delays and political squabbles,
stemming in part from Nevada's objection to being chosen as the site
for the waste dump, scheduled to begin receiving radioactive cargo
in 2003.
   Larry Henry, press secretary for Nevada Gov. Bob Miller, said the
court ruling ``severely weakens the DOE's credibility'' and
underscores the state's contention that the project has been guided
by politics, not science.
   The proposed site at Yucca Mountain is about 100 miles northwest
of Las Vegas.
   Construction has not begun, and Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
has been pressing to begin geologic studies to determine whether the
site would qualify.
   Leo Duffy, Watkins' chief aide on waste issues, said last month
that the department ``can't afford'' to start from scratch in
soliciting bids for the contract.
   Gibson's opinion was not immediately made public, but the gist of
the decision, without explanation, was contained in a brief
memorandum to the parties in the suit.
   Gibson said the opinion would be kept secret until Wednesday to
allow the companies involved to review the document for proprietary
information or trade secrets that should not be made public.
   At issue is a charge by Cleveland-based TRW that Energy
Department officials involved in selecting Bechtel Systems
Management Inc. in 1988 were guilty of a conflict of interest.
   TRW's contention centered on the fact that Samuel Rousso, who had
a hand in selecting Bechtel, had worked for Science Applications
International Corp., a subcontractor to Bechtel. Rousso is director
of the DOE's office of civilian radioactive waste management, which
runs the project.
   Under federal law, DOE supervisors can't participate in any
projects that involve any energy concern for which they worked for
up to one year after leaving that company.
   Department spokeswoman Ginger King said Rousso was not available
for comment Thursday.
   Bechtel spokesman Rick Laubscher said from San Francisco that
company officials were ``very disappointed'' in the ruling, but
hadn't seen the opinion or conferred with the DOE.
   ``We have to do those things before we can speak knowledgeably on
the matter,'' Laubscher said.
   Spokesmen at TRW's Cleveland and Washington, D.C., offices were
not available for comment.

<HEAD>FDA Gave Some Generic Drug Companies Preferential Treatment: Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is considering
changes in how it handles generic drug applications as the result of
a report that said some companies got preferential treatment.
   The report, issued by the inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services, ``confirms that there are serious
weaknesses in FDA's generic drug review process,'' said Rep. Thomas
J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, the senior Republican on the House
subcommittee investigating the generic drug industry.
   ``The problems are not isolated, as some in the agency originally
contended,'' Bliley said. ``The report indicates that the approval
process itself needs to be changed. We will pursue corrective
legislation on a bipartisan basis at the conclusion of the
subcommittee's investigation.''
   Subcommittee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., requested the
report, which found that ``weaknesses in the internal control
structure of this assignment process allowed preferential treatment
to drug firms.''
   Dr. Frank Young, commissioner of food and drugs, said that agency
was evaluating the recommendations and ``will implement the changes
as appropriate.''
   Thursday's report said the FDA ``has taken or planned a number of
corrective actions.''
   The agency has been under fire since it was revealed that some
generic drugs were not properly tested before being allowed on the
market.
   Among other things, the report said, the procedures allow a
branch chief to favor a particular company by assigning that
company's applications to chemists who work rapidly, while
penalizing other companies by assigning their applications to slow
reviewers.
   HHS Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow said his investigation
found three cases in which the same drug from competing companies
had been assigned to the same chemist for review, making it possible
for the chemist to ``deliberately identify fewer deficiencies in one
application while identifying numerous deficiencies in a
competitor's application.''
   The report also said the FDA had established few standard
procedures for chemists to use, a situation it said ``may indirectly
favor one company's application for which a chemist may do a minimal
review and adversely affect another company's application for which
a chemist may do an exhaustive review.''
   ``FDA lacks a quality control system that assures the fundamental
integrity and fairness of the ... review process,'' the report said.
   The report recommended that policies for random assignment of
applications be developed and that there be ``other appropriate
methods for reducing the opportunity to show any partiality to
applicants.''

<HEAD>Pierce Defends His Performance As HUD Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Samuel R. Pierce Jr. denied allegations of favoritism at
HUD and accused critics of misrepresenting his performance,
according to a newspaper interview.
   ``Everybody was treated the same,'' he told the Los Angeles Times
in an interview published in Friday's editions. ``That was the
advice and the word that I gave to the people at HUD.''
   The interview marked Pierce's first public comments about the HUD
furor since he testified before Congress May 25.
   Pierce contradicted that testimony in asserting in the interview
that he was a hands-on manager. He said, however, that he did not
know of the extensive influence allegedly exercised by his former
executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean.
   Pierce said his efforts to help former law partners did not
breach his pledge to sever his ties from the firm because he
received no financial benefit from the favors and had no agreement
to return to the firm.
   Testimony by former HUD officials and documents has portrayed the
agency under Pierce, who served throughout the Reagan
administration, as plagued by mismanagement and influence peddling.
   Pierce would not discuss some subjects, the Times reported. He
noted that he is scheduled to testify again Sept. 15 and has a deal
with a magazine he would not identify to publish his complete story
next month.
   But Pierce strongly rejected allegations that high-powered
Republicans were given preferential treatment by HUD, saying that
funding for projects was based on the merits.
   ``You would look at their project and, if was a worthy project,
they would be treated favorably. If not they would lose it,'' he
said. ``That was the basic approach to all of these. It wasn't an
approach that, if they are a Republican, you have got to add 10
points or give them something extra.''
   Pierce said he believes some members of Congress are attacking
his operation of HUD and misrepresenting his performance because
these lawmakers' traditional role in lobbying for HUD grants was
taken over in part by consultants.
   Developers have testified that they paid large amounts of money
to consultants because the developers thought that doing so was
essential to winning HUD action in the Pierce years.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 2nd graf `The resignation...' to UPDATE

   A major Cabinet member at the center of a sex
scandal resigned Friday, shaking a 2-week-old administration that
has pledged to clean up Japan's seamy politics.
   The resignation of Chief Cabinet Secretary Tokuo Yamashita, the
main government spokesman and top lieutenant to Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu, came one month after former Prime Minister Sousuke
Uno, plagued by allegations of extramarital affairs, announced he
was stepping down.
   Mayumi Moriyama, head of the Environment Agency, was chosen to
replace Yamashita, an official at the prime minister's office said,
speaking anonymously. Mrs. Moriyama, 61, will be the first woman to
hold that post.
   Mrs. Moriyama is serving her second term in the upper house of
Parliament, and was first elected in 1980. The environment portfolio
was her first Cabinet post.
   On Thursday, Yamashita acknowledged his liaison with a bar
hostess. The acknowledgement came the same day the weekly magazine
Shukan Shincho published a story describing the relationship that
began in 1984, when the woman was 21, and lasted more than three
years.
   ``The Kaifu administration had placed cleaning up politics at the
head of its agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the
people ... but in the end I have decided that I must resign,'' he
said at a televised press conference late Friday morning.
   ``I must offer my deepest apologies,'' he said. He added that he
had apologized to his wife and that she had forgiven him. Yamashita,
69, and his wife, Kyoko, have been married 45 years and have four
grown daughters.
   Earlier Friday, he met with Kaifu at the prime minister's
official residence, and later attended a regular weekly gathering of
Cabinet ministers.
   ``The task of the Kaifu Cabinet is to promote clean government,
and as I must follow that and support the prime minister ... I can
offer only my deepest apologies to the people of Japan,'' Yamashita
told a televised news conference Thursday.
   Yamashita was appointed two weeks ago, when Kaifu formed a
government after Uno quit because of an election defeat that cost
the Liberal Democrats their majority in the upper house of
Parliament.
   Uno was in office only two months, hounded by allegations that he
had kept paid mistresses.
   Noboru Takeshita, the man Uno succeeded, resigned to accept
responsibility for the Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal, which
reached the top ranks of government, bureaucracy and business. Uno
was chosen because it had not touched him.
   The latest scandal was considered likely to erode public support
for the Kaifu administration, which has said its priority is
restoration of political ethics.
   Japanese society has been tolerant of rich and powerful men
having affairs and mistresses, and only recently have such matters
been reported. Yamashita said Thursday: ``That such news would be
reported was due completely to my own indiscretion.''
   Yamashita had a reputation as a ``clean'' politician. He was
chosen because he belongs to the same party faction as Kaifu and was
not identified with the influence-buying scandal, which contributed
to the election defeat last month.
   Yotaro Konaka, a prominent author and social critic, said
Thursday: ``The public is not going to tolerate such insensitivity
by political leaders. People must doubt if the new government, which
appointed such a person to its top post just when political ethics
has become a national issue, has any common sense at all.''
   Political analyst Masaya Ito said the scandal ``is particularly
damaging for Kaifu. ... The public is not going to believe what he
says from now on after such a digusting scandal. I am sure many
people are already feeling sick and tired of finding out about new
scandals of their country's leaders.''
   Shukan Shincho said in its edition published Thursday that
Yamashita conducted the affair while serving as transport minister
and head of the Management and Coordination Agency.
   It said he gave the woman 3 million yen ($21,000) on Aug. 3, when
there was speculation he would get a high post in the new
government, and the woman returned it three days later, the magazine
said.
   Yamashita was quoted as denying he tried to buy silence and
saying: ``I did it from my own good intentions after hearing that
she's still having problems in her life.'' The woman was not
identified.

   It started as a simple visit by a couple
of soldiers in combat fatigues with an 8-year-old boy dying of
cancer.
   But by the end of the day, Chris Riley had enlisted in the Army
as a special soldier, flown in a helicopter, ridden in a tanklike
vehicle called a mobile howitzer and made some new friends in the
military.
   ``It certainly is a dream come true,'' said the boy's father,
Robert ``Kip'' Riley. ``He's a big G.I. Joe fan. He was just
thrilled to death, just as thrilled as anyone could be with all
these things.''
   Chris has undergone surgery twice since November 1986 for a brain
tumor, said his mother, Gale Riley. She said chemotherapy was
stopped last month after the cancer spread to Chris' spine, leaving
him in pain and too weak to walk.
   ``Now he's on constant morphine to keep away the pain,'' Mrs.
Riley said. ``And he's lost most of his mobility. There's nothing
more the doctors can do for him right now.''
   ``He's a loving boy. It would have been nice to have all these
things happen when he was able to follow them a little closer,'' his
father added.
   Chris, clad in a camouflage uniform with a black military police
armband and RILEY stitched above his right pocket, nodded weakly
when asked if he enjoyed the 10-minute ride Thursday in the howitzer
across a hilly field a couple of blocks from his home in northern
West Virginia.
   Unable to speak much above a whisper, the shy boy described the
ride as ``loud.''
   ``I saw the look on his face and I sent them around the field
again,'' said Maj. John Pack of the 201st Field Artillery Unit of
the West Virginia Army National Guard as the howitzer roared up a
hill with Chris and his parents inside.
   ``He loves G.I. Joe and we wanted to make one of his dreams come
true. This is the closest thing we have to it.''
   Poor weather conditions delayed Chris' ride in an Army reserve
UH-1 helicopter until late afternoon.
   ``He's just totally wiped out, he's so happy,'' said Mrs. Riley.
``His doctor called and said she didn't want him to go up but he
wanted to do it.''
   Earlier, Chris was sworn in during a special ceremony by Capt.
Duane Hawn of the Army's Fairmont recruiting office, which organized
the event after a family friend suggested a visit from a couple of
G.I. Joes might cheer Chris.
   But Carol Taylor, a secretary at the recruiting office, wasn't
about to let it stop there.
   ``I said why don't we try for a helicopter and a tank,'' said
Taylor. ``I wasn't about to take no for an answer.''
   She didn't have to. Members of the Army's Pittsburgh recruiting
battalion sent a four-man color guard and a stuffed bear decked out
in a camouflage suit. The 201st volunteered its equipment, soldiers
and weapons, and Hawn and 1st Sgt. Gary Johnson prepared an
enlistment certificate for Chris.
   ``We have men here today ... who volunteered to come here because
they have children,'' said Pack. ``If their kids were going through
something like this, they'd want something like this done.
   ``I'd want it for my son, if he were Chris' age. We definitely
say a prayer each night for Chris, and if the good Lord's willing,
maybe he'll pull though this.''

<HEAD>Asteroid Passes Within 2.5 Million Miles Of Earth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Earth is in no danger from a mile-wide
chunk of space rock that zipped within about 2.5 million miles of
the planet.
   ``It's just a nice close approach which makes it very convenient
for astronomers who want to study it,'' said Brian Marsden of the
International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau in Cambridge, Mass.
   The asteroid, named 1989 PB, has been moving at many thousands
miles per hour within close observation range of the Earth for
several days, Marsden said. The point of closest approach, about 2.5
million miles away, was estimated at about 11 p.m. EDT Thursday.
   That's a little more than 10 times the average distance of the
Moon from Earth, about 239,000 miles.
   Eleanor Helin, an astronomer for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, discovered the asteroid Aug. 9 in film studies taken
that day on a telescope at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego.
   When first seen, the asteroid was outside the orbit of Earth and
angling inward, toward the sun, she said.
   ``It will be adjacent, then pass by and then lead the Earth''
over the next few days, she said.
   Helin said asteroid 1989 PB will arc away from the Earth's orbit,
pass around the sun, dipping to a point inside the orbit of Venus
and then loop back out to just beyond the orbit of Mars. It is
expected to cross the Earth's orbit again in about 13 months. But,
as Marsden noted, ``the Earth will not be there then.''
   Asteroid 1989 PB is the sixth to make what Marsden called a
``close approach'' to the Earth this year, but only one other has
been closer.
   In March, 1989 FC passed within 460,000 miles of the Earth. Helin
said this is believed to be the closest asteroid pass in the records
of astronomy, surpassing an asteroid named Hermes that whizzed by
480,000 miles from the Earth in 1937.
   Other close approaches, and their distances from Earth this year,
according to Marsden: 1989 DA in February, 6 million miles; 1989 JA
in June, 8 million miles; 1989 AC in January, 10 million miles; and
1989 FB in early February, 20 million to 30 million miles.
   Marsden said the cluster of close approaches is just ``a
statistical fluke'' and implies nothing about future asteroids.
   But eventually, he said, one of the rapidly moving space
mountains will smash into the Earth.
   ``If we are talking about a period of within a million years, one
almost certainly will hit the Earth,'' he said.
   The chances of a smaller asteroid hitting the Earth is likely
``within a 1,000 years or so,'' he said, noting that one about 100
yards across exploded just over the Siberian plains near Tunguska in
1908. The sound could be heard for hundreds of miles and the
landscape was blasted as if by a small atomic bomb.
   Marsden said an object hit Arizona about 25,000 years ago,
creating a well-known crater near Flagstaff more than a mile across.
   A theory supported by many scientists is that an asteroid that
hit the Earth 67 million years ago caused the extinction of the
dinosaurs, perhaps by causing a rapid change in the weather.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., acknowledged he
hired a male prostitute as a personal employee but fired him when
the congressman became suspicious the man was selling sex from
Frank's home on Capitol Hill.
   ``I was victimized,'' Frank said in a telephone interview from
Boston with The Associated Press early Friday morning. ``Yes, I
showed poor judgment.''
   Frank, an acknowledged homosexual, confirmed details of a story
in Friday's editions of The Washington Times.
   A man identified by the Times as Greg Davis told the newspaper
that Frank was aware that sex was being sold from the congressman's
apartment and was concerned that it might be discovered. The
newspaper said Davis was a professional name and it did not disclose
his real name.
   However, Frank called those allegations ``absolutely untrue.''
   When asked if the revelations might force him to resign from
Congress, Frank replied: ``Of course not.'' He said he planned to
run for re-election for a sixth term in 1990.
   He said he planned to hold a news conference at his Boston office
Friday morning.
   Frank said he met the man, whom he identified as Steve Gobie,
through an ``escort-model'' advertisement in a Washington gay
newspaper. He admitted having paid sex with Gobie, but said the
relationship later became one of friendship.
   ``He was a male prostitute and I thought he was ... smart enough
to do something else,'' Frank told the AP. ``I said he should get a
job.''
   Frank said he hired Gobie as a personal assistant to do work
around his house, drive his car and run errands. Gobie was paid with
personal money, Frank said.
   ``He was using me. I didn't see that,'' Frank said, adding that
he had no first-hand proof that Gobie was running a prostitution
service from Frank's apartment.
   Frank said he became suspicious when his landlady told him there
were ``strange goings-on'' at the house when he was away.
   ``I didn't have anything to go to court with,'' Frank said,
calling the situation ``intolerable.''
   In August 1986, Frank said: ``I called him and ordered him out. I
fired him.''
   There was no telephone listing for Gobie in Washington or its
suburbs.

<HEAD>Center Says Commerce Guarding Turtle Findings Like Espionage Matter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservation group alleges that the Commerce
Department is squelching important biological findings as it
prepares new regulations to protect endangered sea turtles from
drowning in shrimpers' nets.
   ``Conservation of endangered species is not a matter of Soviet
intrigue and espionage,'' Marydele Donnelly of the Center for Marine
Conservation said Thursday.
   Caught between the opposing demands of shrimpers and
environmentalists, the agency has until Sept. 8 to draft final
regulations to hold down mortality rates among five endangered
species of sea turtles.
   The conservation group says it has been unable to obtain
biological opinions from Commerce Department scientists on the most
effective way of preventing sea turtle deaths.
   ``I don't know of any attempt to suppress any scientific
findings, any legal opinions, or any counsel from anyone within the
department on this issue,'' said Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman.
   At issue is whether shrimpers must be required to equip their
nets with devices that allow turtles to escape, the method backed by
environmentalists, or whether they should restrict their tow times
and check their nets before the submerged turtles drown, the choice
of many Gulf Coast shrimpers.
   Under temporary regulations, shrimpers are being required to pull
their nets every 105 minutes or use the turtle excluder devices,
TEDs.

<NOTE>FTC Formalizing New Rules on Food Specials</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grocery stores may offer rain checks or
substitutes when they run out of advertised specials or may specify
beforehand that availability is limited, the Federal Trade
Commission says.
   A final rule, to be published Monday in the Federal Register and
take effect four days later, amends one adopted in 1971 that
required grocers to stock enough advertised items to meet
anticipated demand.
   That rule had rarely been enforced and the commission voted in
April 1988 to approve making the rule change, making Thursday's
action largely a formality.
   The FTC began reviewing its earlier rule in 1984 and determined
that the cost of compliance outweighed the benefits. According to
the review, the 1971 rule imposed an estimated $132 million to $370
million in costs on retail food stores, with those costs passed on
to consumers.

<NOTE>Minorities Seen Gaining in House From 1990s Redistricting</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A demographic expert says minorities stand a
good chance of gaining seats in the House after congressional
district lines are redrawn based on results of the 1990 Census.
   William O'Hare, director of policy studies at the Population
Reference Bureau, also predicted that ``there is going to be a
mountain of litigation'' over issues such as adjustments for
undercounted minorities, whether to exclude illegal aliens and
inclusion of military personnel overseas in the count used for
reapportionment.
   In the 1991-92 reapportionment, O'Hare said, ``the states that
are likely to gain the most congressional seats _ for example,
California, Texas, Florida _ all have large minority populations.''
   He said the country's Hispanic population was expected to show a
particularly strong gain, from about 14.5 million in 1980 up to a
projected 22 million in the 1990 Census _ with most of the increase
concentrated in Sunbelt states.
   Asked what net gain of minority members he expects there will be
in the House, O'Hare said: ``Certainly half a dozen to 10 is not
unreasonable. ... I would say that's optimistic, but not
outlandishly optimistic.''
   The 435-seat House has 36 minority members _ 22 blacks, nine
Hispanics, four Asian-Americans and one American Indian.
   Blacks make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population but have
only 1.5 percent of elected officials, while Hispanics comprise 8
percent of the population but are less than 2 percent of elected
officials, O'Hare said.
   The Population Reference Bureau describes itself as a private,
non-partisan organization that tries to increase public awareness
and understanding of population issues.

   A majority of Communist Party lawmakers
voted for Solidarity's Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister,
embracing the former adversary for his integrity and expressing hope
that he can help save a country in crisis.
   ``I accepted his election with the full conviction that the
government has an excellent helmsman who will steer this boat to
hope and not lead it into the shallows,'' lawmaker Tadeusz Fiszbach,
a deputy Sejm speaker from the Communist Party, said after the vote
Thursday.
   Mazowiecki received at least 91 of the votes from the 173-member
Communist caucus, whose deputies were allowed to vote as they wished
in a departure from traditional party discipline.
   The vote in the Sejm, or lower house of the National Assembly,
was 378-4 with 41 abstentions. Thirty-seven deputies did not appear
for the vote.
   ``There's a lot of them, a lot!'' exclaimed Solidarity journalist
Ewa Milewicz, peering from a balcony as she tried to count the
Communist votes in the Sejm.
   Fiszbach, who sat across the table from Mazowiecki to negotiate
accords that led to legalization of Solidarity in August 1980,
remembered the new prime minister ``as an honest, noble man with
high values, an excellent negotiator and politician.''
   Fiszbach later was stripped of his post as party chief in Gdansk
and his Politburo seat because of his sympathy for Solidarity.
   Army Col. Czeslaw Kosinski, another Communist deputy, also
supported Solidarity's choice for prime minister.
   ``I voted for Tadeusz Mazowiecki because the other Polish
political situation was worse. I know there is now hope that our
system can improve itself,'' he said.
   ``Things will be hard. The job of the prime minister will be to
obtain credibility,'' he said. ``Poles must believe in something and
he (Mazowiecki) is the one who has the best chances.''
   In Moscow, the Soviet Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet,
sent a telegram congratulating Mazowiecki and expressed ``the
certainty that the traditional relations of friendship and
all-around cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland will
continue.''
   An interview with Mazowiecki also was printed Thursday in the
Soviet government's evening newspaper, Izvestia. The new Polish
leader was quoted as saying his government would be open to all,
including the Polish Communist Party, but that the time was clearly
past ``when only one camp could form the government.''
   Solidarity has promised the Communists the strategic ministries
of defense and interior, which control the army and the police.
   ``I am convinced that the party will be represented in the
government and will cooperate. It is a new stage of democracy,''
said Fiszbach.
   Mazowiecki on Wednesday indicated that he would find additional
spots in the Cabinet for the Communists.
   For the first time in 45 years, the party will not lead the
government and Communist deputies say it is time for their movement
to develop new directions.
   ``The party now has a chance to form a new program ... Without
being on the front line,'' said Kosinski.
   In line with the change, a group of 15 deputies on Thursday
submitted a proposal to drop from the constitution the clause that
mandates that the Communist Party be ``the leading political force.''

   Here is a list of the eight moons known
to orbit the planet Neptune.
   Triton and Nereid were discovered from Earth. The moons
designated by numbers were discovered by Voyager as it approached
Neptune. Discovery of moons 1989 N5 and 1989 N6 was announced
Thursday.
   Diameters are NASA estimates and are rounded to the nearest 10
miles. Except for Triton, Nereid and 1989 N6, the moons orbit
Neptune's equator.
   TRITON: 1,720 miles diameter, orbits Neptune every 5.88 days at
an average distance of 205,000 miles above Neptune's cloud tops.
Orbit is inclined 20 degrees out of Neptune's equatorial plane.
Triton also orbits backwards, opposite the direction of Neptune's
rotation. It is only major moon in the solar system with a
retrograde orbit.
   NEREID: 210 miles diameter, orbits Neptune every 360 days in a
highly elliptical orbit ranging from 847,000 miles to 5.97 million
miles above Neptune's clouds. Orbit is inclined 30 degrees out of
Neptune's equatorial plane.
   1989 N1: 260 miles diameter at its widest, orbits Neptune every
26.9 hours at a 57,600-mile distance. This moon is potato-shaped,
the largest non-round moon in the solar system.
   1989 N2: 120 miles diameter, orbits every 13.3 hours at a
30,000-mile distance.
   1989 N3: 90 miles diameter, orbits every eight hours at a
17,000-mile distance.
   1989 N4: 100 miles diameter, orbits every 9.5 hours at a
23,300-mile distance.
   1989 N5: 60 miles diameter, orbits every 7.5 hours at a
15,500-mile distance.
   1989 N6: 30 miles diameter, orbits every 7.1 hours at a
14,400-mile distance. Orbit is inclined 4{ degrees out of Neptune's
equatorial plane.

<TEXT>
   The assassination of a promising young
presidential hopeful has triggered a backlash against drug kingpins
by Colombians who have overcome their fear and are helping
authorities fight back.
   ``We've had a tremendous cooperation from the people,'' the
national police force's press chief, Col. Alfredo Salgado, said in
an interview Thursday.
   ``The people have always wanted to cooperate with the police, but
they were afraid,'' he said. ``They've left aside their fear and are
cooperating.''
   When five suspects in the slaying of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan were
paraded before 15 witnesses this week, the witnesses did not
hesitate in fingering four of them, police said.
   They also said special hot lines set up to receive tips are
providing information that has enabled police to raid several of the
hundreds of drug lords' estates and businesses as part of the
crackdown.
   Salgado said the cooperation was inspired by citizens witnessing
police, for the first time, engaged in a virtual all-out war with
the country's drug cartels. The crackdown was sparked by the
assassinations of Galan, a police colonel and a magistrate in a
48-hour period last week.
   Galan, 46, was a highly popular Liberal Party candidate for
president and the widely acknowleged leader of a new political
generation. He was considered extremely honest and spoke vehemently
about the need to eradicate the drug underworld.
   An assassin pumped five bullets into his lower abdomen, beneath
his bullet-proof vest, as he stood on a small platform during a
political rally on Bogota's outskirts Friday night. Several
accomplices in the killing raked the air with gunfire to provoke
panic and allow the trigger-man's escape.
   Traffickers previously had been blamed for the assassinations of
a justice minister and an attorney general, but Galan's slaying took
drug-sponsored violence to a new level, Colombians contend.
   Clara Obregon Lopez, a former Liberal Party city council member
in Bogota, said his murder showed the traffickers ``are attacking
the core of the country's institutions and want to replace the
current political leadership.''
   The witnesses' decision to identify the killers was ``a
demonstration of the deep indignation of the people,'' she said in
an interview at her home.
   ``The indignation is so strong that it's not leaving room for
fear,'' she said.
   Fear is real and justified in Colombia. As Mrs. Obregon Lopez
recalled, traffickers two years ago killed a 9-year-old girl who had
witnessed the assassination of a leftist political leader in the
town of Barrancabermeja. Another witness survived for two years
before being gunned down a few months ago.
   Since 1981, 220 judges, magistrates and judicial aides have been
killed in the traffickers' campaign of terror against the legal
system.
   Each important assassination has appeared to galvanize Colombian
society, but only temporarily. Previous crackdowns, although not as
intense as the current offensive, have petered out in a few weeks.
   On Thursday, the traffickers declared ``absolute war'' in
response to the police and military actions and to the prospect of
extradition should they be arrested. They counterattacked with
bombings and arson in Medellin, the home of the world's biggest
cocaine cartel.
   Mrs. Obregon Lopez said it was evident ``they are trying to
reinstill fear and dampen spirits, to cut short this anti-narcotics
campaign.''
   U.S. officials have said the Colombian government must show its
resolve by following through on a promise to extradite any drug
lords who are arrested.
   U.S. and Colombian authorities say they are trying to arrange the
extradition of Eduardo Martinez Romero, a suspected finance manager
for the Medellin cartel caught on Saturday.
   Two other possible subjects for extradition, also described as
important trafficking figures, were arrested Wednesday. But the
reputed cartel bosses have yet to be captured.
   Enrique Santos Calderon, an editor of the respected Bogota daily
El Tiempo, said in a commentary Thursday that the latest killings
represent ``the most inconceivable challenge that the traffickers
could have sent to the Colombian state, so arrogant and brutal as to
appear delirious.''
   He called on the government of President Virgilio Barco to take
even stronger action to destroy the cartels and capture their
leaders.
   ``Has the hour finally arrived (when we say) `Enough already?'
... We'll know soon,'' Santos Calderon said.

   Researchers gazed at stark images
of rips and tears in the white carcass of the Edmund Fitzgerald, but
those pictures brought them no closer to answering why the famed
ship sank.
   ``Boy, it's awe inspiring to see. But none of it is surprising,''
said Phil Wright, a Canadian archaeologist on board the research
vessel Grayling that floated above the Fitzgerald wreckage again
Thursday.
   Researchers used a small, submersible robot to obtain the first
clear footage of the sunken boat. The expedition is being filmed for
the National Geographic Society's Explorer television series.
   The 729-foot steel freighter was carrying 27,000 tons of iron ore
down Lake Superior when it sank in a gale Nov. 10, 1975. All 29 crew
members died.
   The tragedy became legend within a year, when Canadian balladeer
Gordon Lightfoot sang of the crew, ``All that remains is the faces
and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.''
   Wright and other researchers aboard the Grayling marveled at
video images showing the Fitzgerald's crumpled pilothouse and
severed hull. Portholes were blown out and half-inch thick steel was
crinkled like tinfoil, while the ship's bell and water cooler
remained untouched.
   ``I was surprised by the visibility. I was surprised that the
bell was sitting on top. It's just unreal,'' said Tom Farnquist,
director of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society at
Whitefish Point and one of three expedition leaders.
   The official U.S. Coast Guard report said the Fitzgerald sank
after taking on water through its hatches as it plowed through
30-foot waves. Others believe the storm dropped the ship onto a
shoal, punching a hole in its hull.
   In either case, the boat sank so quickly there was never a
distress call. The captain's last words were that his ship was
holding its own in the storm.
   Wright said he didn't see any evidence that lent weight to either
theory.
   A 2- to 4-foot rip in the front of the Fitzgerald's hull puzzled
researchers somewhat. Wright theorized the damage occurred when the
boat struck the bottom of the lake.
   ``At the speed she was going, when she hit the bottom, boom,'' he
said, shoving his fist into his hand to illustrate an impact that
would have cracked open the freighter.
   ``I just find that terribly inexplicable,'' said author Fred
Stonehouse, also on board the Grayling. ``It's almost like you
cracked an eggshell. In this case, its half-inch steel.''
   An answer to why the modern freighter sank would be nice, but
expedition leaders are more interested in testing the submersible
robot and its three-dimensional camera system for use on other
shipwrecks.

   The newly consolidated Lutheran church's
interim policy against ordaining practicing homosexuals prompted a
clergywoman to comment, ``So this is the policy we will have about
it while we are trying to develop a policy about it.''
   The remark by the Rev. Gwendolyn King of Hanover, N.H., indicates
the somewhat misty hiatus in which the church finds itself on
various social issues.
   In keeping with Lutheranism's characteristic analytical approach,
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's first decision-making
assembly called for more study before taking definite stands on
several sensitive questions, including sexuality.
   Of that subject's myriad aspects, the Rev. Gerald L. Falk of
Chicago, executive director of the church's social-concerns
commission, said, ``It's a very difficult issue that we must study
carefully, prayerfully and thoroughly so that we can discern the
path which God is calling us to follow.''
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is the result of the
Jan. 1, 1988 merger of the Lutheran Church in America, the American
Lutheran Church and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   The 5.3-million-member denomination ordered studies on a batch of
issues, including the homeless, family life, capital punishment and
health care.
   Action was pending on a proposal for a two-year study of
sexuality, including homosexuality and abortion, but a women's
caucus was pressing for immediate action on abortion.
   ``It's a stopgap until the study is done,'' said Barbara Nelson
of Lindsborg, Kan. It was proposed as necessary because of the
recent Supreme Court decision allowing some state regulation of
abortion.
   Sidestepping numerous proposals by different congregations and
regional synods for definite stands on various social issues, the
assembly referred most of them for study.
   Responding briefly on a grass-roots proposal, the assembly did
condemn racism as a sin and urged Lutherans to stay alert to the
``destructive results of racism.''
   Also, the church affirmed commitment to a ``just and equitable
welfare system'' and encouraged ``those engaged in the task of
welfare reform.''
   The assembly asked for study of gun control by Lutherans, a
church commission and by government to ``explore options for better
management of these weapons through an outright ban or regulation of
lawful sales.''
   On health care, the assembly declared it supported ``high quality
health care for everyone,'' and advocated legislation to achieve
that goal, but authorized studies to develop a policy on the matter.
   The 1,050 voting delegates still had before them some proposed
actions on divestment from companies doing business in South Africa
and on membership in major ecumenical councils.
   The eight-day assembly began Wednesday.
   Noting that many issues were being delayed for studies prior to
action at the second biennial assembly in 1991, the church's
president, Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom said, ``This means that our
1991 assembly should be a lively one.''

   Four alleged Colombian drug kingpins
face charges in U.S. indictments that resulted from testimony in the
1988 conviction of a leader of the Medellin drug cartel, Carlos
Lehder Rivas.
   The other reputed Medellin cartel leaders, Pablo Escobar Gaviria,
Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa
Vasquez, were on the ``most wanted'' list of 12 Colombian drug
dealers issued by the U.S. Justice Department this week. The four
were indicted last March in Jacksonville.
   Those four, along with Ochoa's brother, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, were
also indicted on drug trafficking charges in 1986 in Miami. All are
at-large.
   About 80 alleged Colombian drug traffickers have been indicted in
the United States, but their cases have languished since the
Colombian Supreme Court overturned its extradition treaty with the
United States in 1987.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco, prompted by last week's
assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan,
instituted emergency measures to allow the immediate resumption of
extraditions.
   The extradition treaty was overturned shortly after the
extradition of former cartel leader Lehder in 1987. He was tried in
Jacksonville, convicted of operating a continuing criminal
enterprise, and is now in federal prison serving a life sentence
without parole.
   Cartel leaders Thursday declared war on the Colombian government
just as bombs blew up offices of two principal political parties in
the Colombian city of Medellin, which serves as a base for the
world's biggest cocaine cartel.
   At the time of the March indictment, U.S. Attorney Robert W.
Genzman, said that Escobar was responsible for the April 1983
assassination of Colombian Justice Minister Lara Bonilla.
   After the killing, according to the indictment, cartel members
including Escobar, Lehder, Rodriquez and Fabio and Jorge Ochoa fled
to Nicaragua.
   In Nicaragua, the cartel brought in 1,400 kilograms of cocaine to
the Los Brasiles Air Force Base. Most of the cocaine was flown into
the United States.
   One of the flights resulted in the seizure of 665 kilograms of
cocaine by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. A second
cocaine flight was made by Lehder's pilots from Nicaragua over Cuba,
to Andros Island in the Bahamas and eventually into United States.
   If convicted of the Jacksonville indictment, which lists 205
separate acts beginning in 1974 and continuing until this year, the
Ochoas, Escobar, and Rodriquez would face mandatory life prison
terms. Prosecutors said the indictment involves the importation of
44,000 pounds of cocaine worth $1 billion. In all, 30 people were
named in the indictment.
   Lehder was convicted of creating a small, private air force and
then using the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay as a way station for
shipments for more than 20 tons of cocaine into the United States
for the Medellin cartel.
   The Miami indictment, which alleges smuggling activities of the
Medellin cartel from 1978 to 1986, claims the practices used by the
cartel included ``the corruption of the public officials of foreign
govenments, the use of force, violence, threats, physical assaults
and murders of informants, discordant employees, and cartel
opponents.''

market-affecting news.
   ``We can't make substantial dealings without strong
motivations,'' said a dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Securities dealers said investors were cautious about trading
large volumes because of unstable political conditions.

extramarital affair with a bar hostess.

   A pilot was cleared of criminal complicity
in a July 1988 helicopter escape from the state penitentiary, and he
said he is bitter over what he considers persecution by law
enforcement agencies.
   Following an eight-day trial, a jury deliberated fewer than three
hours Thursday before acquitting Charles Bella of conspiracy and
three counts of assisting a prison escape, all felonies.
   The El Paso, Texas, pilot said afterward he's $500,000 in debt
because of the trial and damage to his helicopter. Justice
triumphed, but he is considering suing New Mexico, he added.
   ``I'm going to try to get a little bit more justice in this
state,'' Bella said.
   Bella had testified that he was hijacked July 11, 1988, by
Beverly Shoemaker, a girlfriend of inmate Daniel Mahoney, and forced
at gunpoint to land in the prison recreation yard to pick up three
inmates.
   He then flew to Mid Valley, where the escapees and Ms. Shoemaker
fled from the helicopter, leaving Bella handcuffed to a control
stick. He said inmate Preston Mitchell returned to the helicopter,
stuck a pistol to his head and ordered him to take off.
   That's when a U.S Customs officer fired at the Gazelle helicopter
and hit a landing skid.
   ``They are either going to try to kill you from the outside or
persecute you on the inside,'' Bella said Thursday.
   Bella said he's working on a book because ``there is a lot to be
learned from this experience. Things were done to me that shouldn't
have been done.''
   District Attorney Chet Walter said: ``Of course we regret but
accept the jury's verdict. We do regret that the jury did not have
at its disposal in making its decision all the evidence that the
prosecution had at its disposal.''
   The judge excluded all hearsay statements by inmate Randy Mack
Lackey.
   The state alleged that Bella conspired with Lackey, Mahoney,
Mitchell and Ms. Shoemaker and that he received $30,000.
   Bella testified that he was contacted on the weekend prior to the
escape by a man identifying himself as Bill Allen of Allen Real
Estate in Santa Fe, who hired him for an aerial real estate survey.
   He said he was hijacked shortly after picking up Ms. Shoemaker at
Santa Fe Airport and forced at gunpoint to land in the penitentiary
recreation yard to pick up the inmates.
   Ms. Shoemaker, who also was charged with conspiracy and three
counts of assisting a prison escape, pleaded guilty last week and
testified for the defense. Her account mainly matched Bella's and
contradicted Lackey's.
   The three inmates were charged with conspiracy and prison escape.
Mahoney was tried and convicted in April. Lackey pleaded guilty in
April to a single charge of prison escape and was sentenced to a
10-year prison term with seven years suspended. Mitchell's trial is
pending.
   Former state Attorney General David Norvell, who teamed with F.
Lee Bailey in defense of Bella, said the fairly brief deliberation
``shows the decision was swift and dispositive and consistent with
what we thought should have been the disposition all along.''

<HEAD>Government and Traffickers Trade Salvos As Cocaine War Heats Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER BAENA</BYLINE>

   The government intensified its war on
drugs, ordering cocaine traffickers to surface and claim $200
million in confiscated property or lose it. Enraged dealers staged a
series of deadly bomb and arson attacks.
   Using emergency powers under a four-year state of siege,
President Virgilio Barco issued a decree Thursday requiring owners
of the seized property personally to make claims for restitution and
barring them from using real estate agents, lawyers or other fronts.
   Police and military agents have seized hundreds of luxurious
mansions, ranches, office buildings, shops and restaurants across
the country along with airplanes, helicopters, cars, trucks and
other items in an unprecedented offensive.
   Defense Ministry officials put the total value of the goods at
about $200 million.
   The government crackdown began last week after the assassinations
of Luis Carlos Galan, a popular presidential hopeful, as well as a
national police colonel and a magistrate. Drug traffickers were
blamed.
   Many of the drug lords face charges in the United States and the
Colombian government promised to extradite any who are arrested.
   Early Thursday, traffickers infuriated by the crackdown bombed
offices of the Liberal and Conservative party offices in downtown
Medellin, killing a passerby.
   They also set fire to the weekend retreats of two prominent
politicians on the outskirts of Medellin, an industrial city 215
miles north of Bogota and the base for the world's biggest cocaine
cartel.
   Families were sleeping in both houses when gangs doused the
structures with gasoline before dawn and set them ablaze,
authorities said. The families ran outside and were not hurt.
   Two bombs, each containing about 45 pounds of dynamite, were
found at the Medellin offices of two national radio networks and
deactivated.
   At one of the stations the bombers left a communique saying: ``We
declare total and absolute war on the government, on the industrial
and political oligarchy, on the journalists who have attacked and
ravaged us, on the judges who have sold out to the government, on
the extraditing magistrates, on the labor union presidents and all
those who have persecuted and attacked us.''
   The communique was signed by The Extraditables, a violent group
authorities link to the Medellin cartel.
   ``We will not respect the families of those who have not
respected our families,'' it said. ``We will burn and destroy the
industries, the properties and the mansions of the oligarchy.''
   Authorities have arrested three alleged drug traffickers as part
of the crackdown, but the bosses of the cocaine cartels are believed
in hiding.
   According to one of Barco's decrees, property that is not claimed
by the owners will be divided among government agencies.
   Rural property will be distributed among landless peasants, and
urban property will go to needy children and mothers, according to
the decree.
   People are tipping police to possible raid sites, said a national
police spokesman, Col. Alfredo Salgado.
   ``The people have always wanted to cooperate with the police, but
they were afraid,'' he said. ``They've left aside their fear and are
cooperating.''
   Barco said seized cash, automobiles and trucks will be used to
improve judges' working conditions, and air and sea craft will go to
the Defense Ministry and the air force's commercial transport
business.
   The president also ordered an inventory of all Colombia's private
airstrips. Those whose legitimate use cannot be proved will be
destroyed under the presumption they are used for drug smuggling.
   Another presidential decree allows secret votes to ensure the
anonymity of Supreme Court magistrates required to rule on the
constitutionality of decrees issued in the anti-narcotics campaign.
Court officers are a constant target of assassination and other acts
of terror by traffickers.
   A U.S. narcotics expert in Bogota said two of the suspected drug
dealers arrested by Colombian police in the crackdown are wanted in
the United States on smuggling-related charges: Eduardo Martinez
Romero and Ana Helena Beatriz Rodriguez.
   A third suspect, Bernardo Londono Quintero, has the same name as
a man wanted in the United States but authorities could not confirm
his identity, the U.S. expert said on condition of anonymity.
   He said he expects U.S. authorities to supply the papers for
Martinez's extradition before Colombian authorities are obliged to
release him. Police are empowered to hold suspects without charging
them for seven working days.
   Politicians say Colombia's latest wave of drug-related violence
jeopardizes the country's electoral process for the first time in
more than 30 years. Elections are planned next March for a new
congress and new mayors. Campaigning already is under way for the
May presidential election.

   Politicians say the latest wave of
drug-sponsored violence, including the slaying of a presidential
candidate, threatens the country's electoral process.
   In March, Colombians are to choose a new Congress and mayors. In
May, a presidential vote is planned, and campaigning is already
under way.
   But according to ex-president Misael Pastrana Borrero, leader of
the opposition Conservative Party, ``the electoral process is badly
compromised,'' both by cocaine traffickers and leftist guerrillas.
   ``There are at least 50 municipalities in which it is impossible
to conduct political campaigning,'' he said in a local radio
interview. ``Under these conditions the electoral process is
wounded.''
   Those municipalities are effectively controlled by leftist
guerrilla organizations or hit squads funded by narcotics
traffickers allied with right-wing extremists.
   The death squads are blamed for countless slayings of leftist and
labor activists and also conduct what is euphemistically called
``social cleansing'' _ the killing of vagabonds, prostitutes, the
elderly and infirm.
   Several leftist guerrilla groups are active in the country. They
control many rural areas, attack military and economic targets _
including oil pipelines _ and kidnap for ransom.
   Ernesto Samper Pizano, a Liberal Party senator and presidential
candidate, complained that ``there are no guarantees (of safety) for
the electoral campaign.''
   He said he feared that ``the process might be jeopardized by new
and unfortunate acts of violence.''
   Last Friday, assassins believed hired by cocaine traffickers
killed the Liberal Party's leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan. His death capped a 48-hour wave of drug-sponsored
slayings that included a police chief and a magistrate.
   Samper Pizano said candidates will change their campaign strategy
to focus more on television spots and cut the number of potentially
dangerous public appearances.
   Political campaigning was suspended indefinitely after Galan's
slaying.
   The new violence comes as democracy is broadening its base.
Mayors used to be appointed, and were elected for the first time
only last year.
   Colombia has endured constant political bloodshed throughout the
1900s, including a bloody rural war between the Liberals and the
Conservatives between 1948 and 1958. The only interruption in the
democratic process was between 1953 and 1957, when a military
government ruled.

<HEAD>Olympic Council Head Says Asia Games in China Will go as Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next year's Asian Games in Beijing will be the
first held under martial law if China does not lift the security
measure, the president of the Olympic Council of Asia said today.
   But Sheikh Fahad Al Ahmad Al Sabah of Kuwait told reporters after
an eight-day inspection tour of the Asian Games facilities that he
was confident China could open the games as planned on Sept. 22,
1990.
   There has been much speculation about whether martial law,
instituted in late May during the popular democracy movement, would
be lifted before the 11th Asian Games. Martial law troops armed with
assault rifles still are stationed at major intersections and
bridges throughout the capital.
   ``If there is martial law or any other security system, it
doesn't concern the OCA,'' the sheikh said.
   Fahad did not say if Chinese officials had told him whether
martial law would end before the games.
   He also did not say if any of the Olympic Committee's 38 member
countries in Asia planned to boycott the games. Hong Kong residents
have urged a boycott to protest the June crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were
killed.
   Fahad said he was satisifed with the progress the Chinese have
made in preparing for the games, which will include 27 events.
   Between 6,500 and 7,000 athletes and officials are expected to
attend. In addition, 4,000 journalists are expected.
   ``The OCA feels that the percentage of construction already
completed is very satisfactory. They have reason to believe that all
the construction facilities will be ready ahead of time,'' the
Olympic Committee delegation said in a news release.
   Reporters touring the main games complex in northern Beijing
earlier this week could see that much work remained to be done. A
future press center and two planned hotels were mere shells, and the
swimming stadium and warm-up gym had roofs but no walls.
   Construction of 16 stadiums and renovation of 11 existing
facilities slowed to a virtual crawl last winter because of a
shortage of building materials and theft. Work was interrupted this
spring by the student-led democracy movement, which hampered
delivery of supplies. Workers were lured off the job to watch or
participate.
   Asked what he thought was the biggest problem, Fahad said:
``Security is a great problem. Food is a great problem.
Transportation is a great problem. Communication is a great problem.
Accommodations is a great problem. All these are great problems.''
   Chinese officials have acknowledged that funding also is a
problem.
   Wu Zhongyuan, spokesman for China's Asian Games Committee, said
on Monday that the estimated cost of holding the games has risen to
$673 million, up from last year's estimate of $565 million.
   To raise money and to drum up enthusiasm for the games, officials
have started selling lottery tickets, which ordinarily are illegal.
Interest seems to be high, with crowds gathered around tables set up
on main streets to buy the tickets, which each go for 1 yuan, or
about 27 cents. The top prize is worth $270.
   Red banners throughout the city appeal to residents' patriotism
and exhort them to help with Asian Games preparations. Collection
boxes have been seen on some streets, and a billboard at a major
intersection counts down the number of days left until the opening
ceremony.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic, CWA Reach Agreement in Washington.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Bell Atlantic and striking
members of the Communications Workers of America here have reached a
tentative settlement, but talks elsewhere produced varying results,
officials say.
   Negotiators for the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. and the
CWA local that represents its four subsidiaries announced the
agreement after meeting twice on Thursday.
   ``We look forward to getting everyone back to work,'' said Bell
Atlantic spokesman Larry Plumb.
   But CWA spokesman Bill Bickers said none of the 41,000 C&amp;P
employees who have been on strike since Aug. 6 would return to work
until local issues are settled at all Bell Atlantic subsidiaries.
   C&amp;P operates telephone companies in the District of Columbia,
Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia. Local issues in dispute
involved such things as work rules and the contracting of work
traditionally done by union employees to outside firms.
   Basic agreement on economic issues throughout the Bell Atlantic
system was reached a week ago. The only outstanding local issues
remaining among subsidiaries and the CWA involved Bell of
Pennsylvania and Diamond State Telephone, Plumb said.
   ``We're pleased to have settled issues of job security and work
rules with C&amp;P Telephone,'' said CWA Vice President Peter Catucci.
``But we're dismayed by the retrogressive demands still on the
table.''
   Catucci charged that those companies were ``completely
unresponsive'' to the needs of the workers and placed ``major
obstacles'' in the path of a settlement. The company wants the union
to give back some arbitration decisions, Bickers said.
   Bell of Pennsylvania reached agreement with the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers on Sunday.
   In New Jersey, the IBEW rejected New Jersey Bell's final offer
late Thursday, Plumb said. The union, which represents 9,100
workers, presented a counter-offer that Plumb said ``leaves the two
sides far apart.''
   New Jersey Bell settled its local issues with the CWA earlier in
the week.
   In Ohio, contract talks resumed for the first time in the 12-day
strike by 10,000 Ohio Bell employees Thursday, with both the CWA and
the company indicating interest in making headway. Meetings were
scheduled to continue this afternoon.
   CWA and Illinois Bell on Thursday afternoon met for the first
time since the strike began, but phone company negotiators walked
out in early evening, saying the union was not willing to make key
concessions on pay, said company negotiator Francine Soliunas.
   CWA officials countered that Illinois Bell has refused to make
concessions as part of the collective bargaining process. No further
bargaining sessions were scheduled.

   A woman trying to convince authorities that
her ex-husband sexually abused their daughter has been offered help
by two people who say they were molested by him years ago.
   Jesse Murabito, 40, fled with her two children after her former
husband, Mark Russell Murabito, was acquitted in November of charges
that he sexually assaulted his daughter. In 1987, the judge in the
couple's divorce heard a week of testimony before rejecting similar
allegations.
   Now, Brett Spaulding, 23, of Fort Myers, Fla., and Elisa
Robinson, 26, of Groton, Conn., say they were sexually molested by
Murabito as children when they lived with their families at a
religious community in Epping.
   Asked to comment on the allegations, Murabito's lawyer, Raymond
Kellett, called them slanderous and ``another case of Jesse trying
to introduce sensationalism to the case.''
   Murabito referred all questions to Kellett.
   Murabito, 34, of Derry received joint custody with the state of
his daughter, 6, and son, 4, after Mrs. Murabito went underground
with the children. They were found in Montana earlier this month and
the children are in foster care at an undisclosed location in New
Hampshire.
   Spaulding said he was 5 years old when Mark Murabito, then about
16, sexually abused him on the grounds of Green Pastures community
of the Emissaries of Divine Light church in Epping.
   ``I remember everyone else was going to dinner when `Rusty'
(Murabito) called me by my first name,'' Spaulding said in a
telephone interview from Fort Myers. ``I went over and he pulled me
by the hair and took me into a hall and wouldn't let me leave. He
made me have oral sex with him.''
   Spaulding said he doesn't remember much more. His mother, Alice
Spaulding, 60, said her son described the alleged sex act to her
after he returned home late that day.
   Spaulding said he and his parents put the incident behind them
and didn't think of it until a friend of his mother's visiting from
New Hampshire brought them a newspaper article on the Murabitos'
case. The case made national news two years ago when Mrs. Murabito
hid the children and went to jail for a week rather than let them
visit their father.
   He said he decided to come forward because he didn't want the
same thing to happen to someone else.
   Robinson said Murabito molested her when she was about 8 years
old.
   ``Rusty was the baby sitter one night when the adults were at the
chapel,'' Robinson said in a telephone interview from Groton. ``I
was supposed to be asleep but had been reading a book when I heard
Rusty coming up the stairs.
   ``I put the book down and pretended to be asleep,'' she said.
``He sat on the edge of the bed, pulled the cover down, and pulled
my underwear down. Then he sat and stared at my crotch for a while.''
   Robinson said she felt ``very uncomfortable and embarrassed''
afterward.
   Unlike the Spauldings and Robinson and her mother, Murabito and
his family did not live at the religious community, but went to
Green Pastures for church services and functions.
   Robinson said she kept silent about the incident for 10 years
before telling her mother. Robinson said she followed the Murabito
case in the news and became interested in it when she moved to
Exeter briefly last year while Murabito's felonious sexual assault
trial was in progress.
   Robinson said she wanted to testify against Murabito at the
trial, but Rockingham County Superior Court Judge Robert Temple
wouldn't allow it. County Attorney Carleton Eldredge said the judge
would not let her take the stand because Murabito's prior behavior
had no bearing on the case.
   Eldredge said he considers Robinson credible and believes her
story.
   Mrs. Spaulding said she and her husband told church authorities
about the incident and that Murabito wasn't allowed on the farm for
a long time.
   Tom Starrs, a spokesman for Green Pastures, said he knew nothing
about Spaulding's claims. He said the church officials who ran Green
Pastures at the time are dead and the church kept no records that
could document the story.
   ``I never heard anything of it before and would find it hard to
believe. He (Murabito) is a fine person,'' said Starrs.

<HEAD>Israeli Foreign Minister's Kenya Trip Intensifies Diplomatic Drive</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens' trip to Kenya to
sign a cooperation pact is part of a diplomatic offensive offering
agricultural and military help to African countries in return for
political support.
   The effort has been faring well despite Third World criticism of
Israel's battle against the Palestinian uprising in the occupied
lands, Israeli ties with South Africa and Arab attempts to block
Israeli inroads in the region.
   ``Surprisingly, the Palestinian uprising has had little effect on
African nations seeking better relations with Israel,'' said Naomi
Chazan, an Africa expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
   Arens left for Nairobi on Thursday night and was to sign an
agreement today with Kenya that provides for assistance in water
conservation, desert reclamation and soil preservation. Eighty
percent of Kenya's land is arid and unsuitable for agriculture.
   Military analysts say Kenya also received shipments of
surface-to-surface missiles from Israel last year.
   In return for such aid, one highly placed Foreign Ministry source
said, African nations are ``expected to show good will and abstain
from voting on anti-Israel resolutions in the United Nations.''
   Thirty African nations broke relations with Israel during the
1973 Middle East war in a show of support for Israel's Arab
adversaries.
   Since then, black Africa has joined forces with Arab and East
bloc nations in repeatedly censuring Israel in the United Nations.
But Israeli officials see this situation as turning around.
   ``In the last seven years, we are slowly but surely regaining our
1973 position in Africa,'' said Meir Yoffe, head of the African desk
at the Foreign Ministry.
   Chazan said, however, that this is ``a gradual and incremental
process. Israel will probably not entirely regain its former
status.''
   Seven countries have resumed full relations with Israel in recent
years, including Liberia, the Ivory Coast, Togo, Cameroon, Zaire and
most recently, Kenya and the Central African Republic. Israel has a
diplomatic representative in Ghana operating through the Swiss
Embassy.
   Malawi, Swaziland and Lesotho never broke ties.
   The diplomatic thaw is a result of political changes in the
region and a decline in Arab aid resulting from dwindling oil
revenues.
   The 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty that normalized relations
between the former enemies led African countries to feel it was
permissible to resume relations, Yoffe said.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which for years demanded
Israel be destroyed, last year accepted the Jewish state's right to
exist, giving Kenya ``just the opportunity it was waiting for. This
gave legitimacy to its action,'' said a source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Israeli sources say African countries often threaten to resume
ties with Israel as leverage to gain aid from Arab countries.
   Israel has much to offer Africa. Two-thirds desert itself, Israel
has perfected rough-and-ready agricultural techniques suitable to
Africa's arid climate and rugged conditions.
   ``Our advisers go out into the bush while other advisers stay at
their hotels in the capital,'' Yoffe said.
   A defense data bank in London reports that Israel also is
providing military hardware and training to African nations.
   Reports say Zairean President Sese Seko Mobuto's palace guard is
Israeli-trained, and Israeli advisers are reportedly active in
Ethiopia, Cameroon, Liberia and Guinea.
   Unconfirmed reports speak of Israel sending advisers and military
supplies to Gambia, the Cenral African Republic, Chad, Uganda and
Sierra Leone.
   ``It is in Israel's interest to keep African countries stable
politically,'' a senior Israeli source said on condition of
anonymity.
   Israeli development projects in Africa now total $400 million, 60
percent of which is in countries that do not have relations with
Israel, senior government sources said.
   Nigeria, an African nation with a large Moslem population and no
formal ties with Israel, is the largest recipient of Israeli
technical aid, they said.
   ``Nigeria is an important and influential state,'' Chazan said.
``Everyone is watching it and wondering whether it will resume
relations with Israel.''
   Parallel to Israeli advances, the PLO has established a number of
offices in African nations.
   ``The African countries are using this to signal that Israel and
the Arabs are not mutually exclusive in Africa,'' Chazan said.

<HEAD>Police Grab Flags From Ukraine Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police grabbed national flags away from Ukrainians
who marched through the republic's capital of Kiev and attacked
protesters at a mass meeting, activists said today.
   Six demonstrators from among about 2,000 were arrested at
Wednesday's march and meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of the
Soviet-Nazi pact that divided up Poland and the Baltic states,
Ukrainian Helsinki Group spokesman Anatoly Dotsenko said.
   Activist Oles Shevchenko said police under orders to take away
the aqua-and-yellow Ukrainian flags beat several people ``using
their fists and in some cases clubs.''
   ``It was a wild and disgusting sight,'' Shevchenko, also of the
Helsinki group, said by phone from Kiev.
   No one was reported seriously injured.
   Dotsenko said that of the six protesters arrested, three were
released and three were required to pay symbolic fines of $16.
   The protesters had official permission to meet in a city stadium
but they were warned by police not to raise ``national symbols,''
Dotsenko said.
   He said they defied the order and held up their flags. They also
shouted ``Freedom to the Ukraine'' and slogans denouncing Soviet
power and the republic's conservative party chief, Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky.
   Mass meetings with similar slogans were held in the Ukrainian
cities of Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk and Dnepropetrovsk, Dotsenko said.
   In Moscow, at least 75 protesters were arrested Wednesday night
at an illegal rally in Pushkin Square.
   In the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, display
of national flags is legal and common. Hundreds of thousands of
Baltic residents took part Wednesday in a giant human chain and a
variety of protests and meetings without any reported clashes with
police.
   Reformist movements in the Ukraine lag behind similar groups in
the Baltics, however. Dotsenko said a founding congress for the
Ukrainian Popular Movement would be held in Kiev on Sept. 8 to help
organize the republic's grass-roots forces.

<TEXT>
   The government is trying to halt an
alarming decline in palm trees on the Persian Gulf island state in
recent decades, a government official says.
   Sheik Mohammed bin Abdul-Wahab al Khalifa, director of research
for the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, said Thursday that in
the past 30 to 40 years the number of Bahrain's palm trees has
dwindled from about 1 million to a little more than 250,000.
   Mohammed, a U.S.-educated prince in Bahrain's ruling family,
blamed the decline on widespread urbanization, the increasing
salinity of underground reservoirs and an agricultural trend toward
more profitable vegetable growing.
   His department is studying hybrid fertilization and seeding
programs to bolster palm tree growing, he said.

   More than 150 Vietnamese refugees
landed in a fishing town south of Manila after a weeklong crossing

   Col. Rogelio Regalado, Philippine Constabulary commander in
Batangas province, said the 90 men, 37 women and 27 children arrived
Wednesday in the town of Calaca, 50 miles southwest of the capital.
   Regalado said the refugees, led by a man claiming to be a

come from the town of Nha Trang.
   The refugees have been turned over by the military to the
government welfare office for transfer to a refugee camp run by the

<HEAD>Pierce Defends His Performance As HUD Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Samuel R. Pierce Jr. in an interview published today
strongly rejected allegations that his department gave high-powered
Republicans preferential treatment.
   ``Everybody was treated the same,'' he told the Los Angeles Times
in his first published interview in three months. ``That was the
advice and the word that I gave to the people at HUD.''
   Pierce also said his efforts to help former law partners did not
breach his pledge to sever ties to the firm because he received no
financial benefit from the favors and had no agreement to return to
the firm.
   Pierce, who was in the Cabinet throughout the Reagan
administration, had not commented publicly about the HUD influence
peddling furor since he testified before Congress May 25. He is
scheduled to testify again Sept. 15 and said he is looking forward
to ``setting the record straight.''
   Pierce, in the interview, would not discuss some subjects, citing
his upcoming testimony and a deal with a magazine he did not
identify to publish his complete story next month.
   He would not discuss why he ordered HUD in 1985 to fund a Durham,
N.C., housing project that was opposed by many staff members but
supported by the Republican mayor of Durham. The mayor was a former
law colleague of Pierce's and a former Reagan campaign strategist.
   ``I had what I think, anyway, were good reasons, but I will have
to save that for the subcommittee,'' he said.
   Pierce insisted funding for projects was based on merits. He said
he believes some members of Congress whom he would not identify are
attacking him because these lawmakers' traditional role in lobbying
for HUD grants was taken over in part by consultants.
   Developers have testified that they paid large amounts of money
to consultants because they thought doing so was essential to
winning HUD action in the Pierce years.
   ``Some of these congressmen, they are saying, `Nobody can get you
this but us. This is our job, and we don't want any competition,'''
said Pierce.
   Pierce asserted that he was a hands-on manager, but acknowledged
he did not know of the extensive influence allegedly exercised by
his former executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean.
   In his May testimony, Pierce said that he was not a hands-on
manager and that he was not involved in recommending funding for
specific projects. But later testimony by other former officials
showed that Pierce was directly involved in some projects.
   ``Of course, I was involved in making decisions and
recommendations,'' he said. ``You can't be in a job for eight years
and not make a decision.''
   The congressional inquiry was sparked by allegations that HUD's
moderate rehabilitation program to repair rental housing for the
poor and elderly was beset by favoritism. Testimony has disclosed
that Ms. Dean, rather than a committee, made many of the decision
about which projects were funded.
   ``I didn't find out until the hearings that it was working that
way,'' Pierce said. ``I had a damn good right to think that it was
working right.''
   Ms. Dean has refused to testify and has asserted through her
attorneys that HUD funding decisions were made by Pierce.

   The Soviet Union has turned to South
Korea for ship repairs in Asia by shifting away from Singapore and
Japan, industry officials said today.
   South Korean shipyards have repaired 36 Soviet ships and earned
$55 million since the end of last year, when the two countries began
direct economic dealings despite a lack of diplomatic ties, they
said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is
more expensive to have ships repaired in Japan and that South Korea
is closer to Soviet Far Eastern ports than Singapore.
   Most of the repairs the first half of this year went to Hyundai
Mipo Dockyard Co. Ltd., which operates a major repair yard in Ulsan
on the southeast coast, said the officials.

<HEAD>Soviet, American Scientists Urge Joint Action Against Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cold War was nothing compared to the
worldwide Heat War possible if U.S. and Soviet leaders fail to
cooperate to halt global warming, scientists said.
   Climate shifts and a rising sea level could pit rich nations
against poor, northern nations against southern, and inland nations
against coastal, participants at a U.S.-Soviet conference on global
warming said Thursday.
   A sea-level rise of three feet in the next century would force
millions of people to flee the lowlands of Bangladesh and other
Third World nations, creating ``environmental refugees,'' said
astronomer Carl Sagan.
   ``Where will those people go? Are there going to be food wars? Or
water wars? What happens if the American Midwest becomes scrub
desert?'' Sagan asked.
   Sagan is one of more than 80 Americans and 11 Soviets
participating in a four-day symposium dubbed ``greenhouse glasnost''
by its co-sponsors, the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Institute
for Resource Management, founded by actor-filmmaker Robert Redford.
   ``We have to get past this business of hearing the phrase, `We
need more study,''' Redford said. ``We must act.''
   The United States and Soviet Union are the world's biggest
producers of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons, gases that trap
solar heat in a process called the greenhouse effect.
   The superpowers' leadership is needed because developing nations
are fast catching up with the superpowers in producing pollutants,
Sagan said.
   ``You can't tell these Third World countries, `Please don't do
what we did,''' he said. ``The United States and Soviet Union have
to come in with economically feasible alternatives.''
   Developing countries have few resources to adapt to major climate
shifts, Sagan said, but even wealthy nations cannot stop global
warming alone.
   ``The planet is a unit. No one nation can solve the problem,'' he
said. ``We're all in the greenhouse together.''
   Soviet scientist Roald Sagdeev recalled a warning he recently
gave a Russian audience: ``I suggested that the issue of
environmental survival should be elevated to the level of nuclear
survival.''
   Conference organizers hope to contact President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to urge concrete steps to reduce global
warming.
   Suggested strategies include: increasing energy efficiency to
reduce levels of carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels;
slowing the destruction of the world's forests; and planting new
trees.
   Although scientists do disagree, ``they're all in the same
ballpark,'' Sagan said. Various studies predict global temperatures
will rise 3 to 10 degrees during the next century. Even the low
figure could cause catastrophic climate changes.
   ``That there is something to worry about _ a concurrence of the
oracles _ is very clear,'' Sagan said.
   But it may not be the lack of knowledge that proves the biggest
stumbling block, said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
   ``Politicians are aware, but politicians are fervently
short-sighted,'' Bradley said. ``They look at the next election and
not the next generation.''
   If policymakers wait for more conclusive evidence, it will be too
late, said Peter Gleick, a researcher at the Pacific Institute for
Studies in Development, Environment and Security.
   ``Even if we were to take drastic actions today, climate changes
are already in the works,'' he said.
   Soviets at the conference include climatologists, a filmmaker and
an author. Americans include scientists and business, environmental,
and political leaders.
   Redford said the conference invited non-scientists to spread
support for the fight against global warming.
   ``We're here to pass the baton from scientific people, who know
what's going on, to the rest of us, who can do something about it,''
he said.

abusing power, Cuba's government news agency said.
   Prensa Latina said the trial began Thursday for ex-Interior
Minister Gen. Jose Abrantes and the other defendants, who also are
accused of negligence and improper use of public resources.
   Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, identified the other six
as Pascual Martinez Gil and Roberto Gonzalez, both generals; Oscar
Careno, Manuel Gil and Rolando Castaneda, all lieutenant colonels;
and Hector Carbonnel, whose rank was not specified.
   The presiding judge in the military tribunal is Gen. Ulises
Rosales, who also oversaw July's trial of 14 Cuban officers.
   Last month, Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa and three other officers were
executed after being found guilty of drug trafficking. Ten other
officers also were convicted in the scandal.

   A key Cabinet member resigned today after
apologizing for having an extra-marital affair, and Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu gave the job to a woman.
   Mayumi Moriyama, 61, director-general of the Environment Agency,
was named to replace Tokuo Yamashita, 69, as chief Cabinet
secretary, a highly visible post that includes speaking on behalf of
the government and coordinating Cabinet affairs. She is the first
woman ever to hold the post.
   It is the second sex scandal to hit the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party in two months. Sousuke Uno announced his
resignation as prime minister in July amid allegations he had an
extra-marital affair with an ex-geisha.
   Mrs. Moriyama's appointment was widely seen as intended to
contain damage caused by the latest scandal, but analysts and party
officials expressed doubt about whether she has enough experience to
handle the current situation.
   ``I was just appointed and I can't really tell what it is going
to be like,'' she said in a news conference. ``But as far as my near
40-year professional experience is concerned, I never felt any
handicaps for being a woman.''
   Yamashita announced his resignation this morning after
apologizing for an extra-marital affair with a bar hostess 43 years
younger than him.
   ``The Kaifu administration had placed cleaning up politics at the
head of its agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the
people ... but in the end I have decided that I must resign,''
Yamashita told a news conference.
   He said he had apologized to his wife, Kyoko, and that she had
forgiven him. They have been married 45 years and have four grown
daughters.
   Kaifu told reporters that he regretted the resignation of
Yamashita, his aide and close friend, but said he would continue to
promote political reforms.
   ``Mrs. Moriyama has experience as a housewife as well as that of
a bureaucrat,'' he said. ``I would like her to push foward political
reforms from the standpoint of the people.''
   A former bureaucrat in the Labor Ministry, Mrs. Moriyama was
first elected to the upper house of parliament in 1980. She never
held a Cabinet post until Kaifu appointed her two weeks ago to head
the Environment Agency.
   Her late husband, Kinji Moriyama, a member of the lower house of
parliament, was transport minister and director-general of the
Science and Technology Agency in past governments.
   Soichiro Tawara, a prominent political critic, said Mrs.
Moriyama's appointment ``is apparently aimed at bettering the image
of the government. But I can't help thinking the choice was made
perhaps a little too hastily and lightly.
   ``She may be helpful in some ways, but I am not confident that a
politician with such limited experience can handle perhaps the most
demanding position in the Cabinet.''
   Tawara added that the Liberal Democratic Party ``seems to be
ignoring the essence of politics.''
   ``As a result,'' he said, ``one problem leads to another. It
doesn't look like the LDP's trouble ends with this.''
   But another political critic, Noriko Kimoto, said the
unprecedented appointment of a woman to the high office will be a
gain for Japan.
   ``The task of the chief Cabinet secretary may be overwhelming for
Mrs. Moriyama with her limited experience, but in the long run I
believe it was the only positive effect of the ugly sex scandal,''
she said.
   The immediate goal of Kaifu's 2-week-old administration is to
salvage public support for the government and the Liberal Democratic
Party.
   But analysts said Yamashita's resignation will severely undermine
Kaifu's leadership.
   ``The sex scandal ... will be particularly damaging for the Kaifu
government,'' said promiment political analyst Masaya Ito. ``The
clean and progressive image was said to be the only strength for the
Kaifu administration, which lacks a strong power base within the
party.''
   The party's popularity has been severely eroded because its
leaders were involved in bribery and sex scandals, and the public
also dislikes a new 3 percent sales tax passed by the Liberal
Democrats.
   Kaifu replaced Uno, who resigned after only two months in office
following his sex scandal and the party's worst election defeat.
   Yamashita became the sixth Cabinet member, including former prime
ministers Noboru Takeshita and Uno, to resign in disgrace in less
than a year.
   Leaders of the opposition camp, eager to take over the government
for the first time from the Liberal Democrats, quickly opened attack
following Yamashita's resignation.
   ``I am completely speechless,'' said Takako Doi, chairwoman of
the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition group. ``I wonder
what he thinks women are. It is a reflection of a lack of
responsibility of the LDP.''
   Eiko Nukiyama, vice chairwoman of the Democratic Socialist Party,
said: ``Society has been much more generous toward politicians than
ordinary people on matters regarding money and women until recently.
But I think, in principle, politics must be based on strong
morality, and higher ethical standards should be enforced on
politicians.''

<HEAD>Former Top PTL Executive Sentenced to Eight Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former PTL vice president Richard Dortch
said he was humiliated by his actions that resulted in an eight-year
prison sentence and a $200,000 fine.
   ``I failed my master, failed my family and failed myself,'' said
Dortch, as he pleaded for mercy at his sentencing Thursday.
   Dortch's sentence was part of a plea agreement in exchange for
testimony against Jim Bakker, founder of the television ministry,
whose trial on the same fraud and conspiracy charges starts Monday.
   ``I could not believe that I participated in this ... in
deceiving people, in doing something I knew was wrong,'' Dortch said
after prosecutors showed the judge charts detailing a pattern of
financial manipulations at PTL. ``The shame of that was the most
humiliating thing I have ever known.''
   Prosecutor Deborah Smith said memos between Dortch and the PTL
financial office showed calculated attempts to hide PTL's financial
difficulties.
   ``The victims in this case are in the thousands,'' she said.
``They are waiting to see the court's assessments. They are waiting
for justice.''
   Dortch, Bakker's top assistant at PTL, pleaded guilty earlier
this month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud and agreed to
testify against Bakker. Bakker is charged with using ministry funds
to finance his opulent lifestyle, including expensive homes, cars
and an air-conditioned dog house.
   Dortch is the third former Bakker aide to be convicted. Former
aides James and David Taggart, were convicted of evading taxes on
$1.1 million in ministry funds that prosecutors said they used to
buy Cartier jewelry, designer clothes and a Manhattan apartment.
They will be sentenced Sept. 8.
   Thursday, prosecutors presented evidence that even though Dortch
and Bakker said there would be a limit of 30,000 ``lifetime
partnerships'' sold in the Towers Hotel at PTL's Heritage USA
religious theme park, 68,755 partnerships were sold.
   Lifetime partners made a one-time donation of $1,000 in exchange
for three nights' free lodging each year for life, but the Towers
Hotel and other hotels planned for Heritage USA were never built or
were left uncompleted.
   Prosecutors said the Towers project alone generated $74.2 million
but only $11.4 million was spent on the uncompleted facility.
   The indictment alleges that the PTL executives spent more than $4
million on themselves and used some of it for operating expenses.
   The charts showed that Dortch collected $1,128,735 in salaries,
bonuses and tax-deferred retirement payments between January 1984
and June 1987. The bonuses alone in those three years amounted to
$550,000.
   Investigators also said that Dortch lived rent-free in a
PTL-owned home valued at $400,000 and that he had asked PTL's
builder to ``bury'' $233,000 in parsonage renovations in the
construction account for the Towers Hotel project.
   Dortch didn't attempt to blame Bakker.
   ``I lost the thing that I lived for _ my ministry,'' he said, his
voice cracking, before he was sentenced.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave Dortch four years in
prison and a $100,000 fine on the wire fraud charge, and four years
in prison and a $100,000 fine on the conspiracy. The prison terms
were consecutive.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms lingered across the northern Plains early today,
hours after storms produced large hail and damaging winds in Montana
and the Dakotas.
   Showers and thunderstorms also struck Kansas and southern
Nebraska today. A thunderstorm late Thursday in central Kansas
produced golf ball-size hail at Hesston.
   Thunderstorms in western South Dakota produced hail 1\ inches in
diameter near Opal. Thunderstorms west of Rapid City produced more
than 2 inches of rain in less than an hour Thursday evening.
   Storms in eastern Montana left up to 4-foot drifts of hail in
ditches along roads and produced golf ball-size hail which broke
windows at Rock Springs. A thunderstorm at Jordan, Mont., produced
wind gusts to 65 mph.
   Thunderstorms in northwestern North Dakota produced hail an inch
in diameter at Bowbells and damaging winds near Newtown.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered today along a
stationary front from southern Illinois and western Kentucky to
Virginia and North Carolina.
   Showers doused the northern Rockies and widely scattered showers
and thunderstorms lingered over the southern Rockies.
   Clear skies prevailed across the Southwest and from the
Mississippi Valley to the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over the northern and central Plains, the middle and lower
Mississippi Valley, the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf
Coast and the southern Atlantic Coast; thunderstorms developing over
parts of west Texas; and showers over the northern Rockies.
   Highs are expected to be in the 60s and 70s in the northern
Atlantic Coast, the Great Lakes, northern New England, the northern
Plains, the northern Rockies, the Pacific Northwest and along the
California coast; in the 100s in parts of central and southwest
Texas and the desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees at Yellowstone Park in Wyoming to 88 degrees at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Personality Traits in Compulsive Gamblers Linked to Biological Factors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compulsive gamblers have disturbances in their
central nervous systems that may partly emerge in their
personalities, particularly in their tendency to be risk takers and
sensation seekers, a study says.
   But experts in treating compulsive gamblers said the study cannot
answer the question of whether the altered chemical activity is a
cause or a result of gambling, or whether it might characterize all
hooked gamblers.
   The study found that high levels of certain chemical reactions in
the nervous systems of 17 compulsive gamblers were associated with
high scores for ``extraversion'' on a written personality test.
   ``Extraversion'' is a psychiatric term for the tendency to be
outgoing, physically and socially active and to take risks,
psychiatrists say.
   The researchers, who reported their findings in the August issue
of the American Medical Association's Archives of General
Psychiatry, said the chemicals they studied are important in the
phenomenon of physical arousal.
   Physical arousal, previous research suggests, may ``be both a
major reinforcer and a maintaining factor in pathological
gambling,'' said the study, conducted at the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Md.
   Researchers looked at chemicals taken from blood, urine and
spinal fluid that indicated activity in the body's noradrenergic
system, which governs such diverse processes as the functioning of
organs and communications between nerve cells in the brain.
   Subjects were men who had met the psychiatric definition of
compulsive gamblers and who participated as inpatients at an NIH
research unit in Bethesda, said the authors of the study, led by Dr.
Alec Roy. He could not be reached for comment Thursday, when his
telephone went unanswered.
   ``What's most important about the article is that people are
beginning to realize that compulsive gambling is an illness, which
is something I don't think Pete Rose is ready to admit,'' said Dr.
Paul Fink, medical director of the Philadelphia Psychiatric Center,
which runs a treatment program for pathological gamblers.
   Rose, manager of the Cincinnati Reds, was banned from
major-league baseball for life Thursday for betting on his own team
_ allegations that Rose denies.
   But Fink, immediate past president of the American Psychiatric
Association, cautioned that the study couldn't say whether the
chemical activity preceded the gambling or followed it.
   And he said the small sample of subjects did not justify
generalizations about all compulsive gamblers.
   Durand F. Jacobs, a research psychologist and a board member of
the National Council on Compulsive Gambling, agreed.
   ``I think the research ... is very important, but it needs
further testing and verification,'' he said in a telephone interview
Thursday from Loma Linda, Calif., where he is psychology director of
the Veterans Administration hospital.
   Jacobs said his own theory on addictions, based on 30 years of
research, is that regardless of biological conditions, ``all addicts
have had a childhood where they've been subject to experiences that
make them feel inferior. ... They feel inadequate, and no matter
what they do it's never enough.''
   Dr. Richard J. Rosenthal, a psychiatrist at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said he has found a close association
between compulsive gambling and outstanding athletes.
   ``Being people who are drawn to action and activity as a way of
dealing with problems, a way of soothing and comforting themselves,
it is very natural for them to be attracted to sports. ... They
frequently excel in sports,'' he said.
   Jean Falzon, executive director of the New York-based National
Council on Compulsive Gambling, a research, training and referral
group, said the study should not be used as an excuse by gamblers.
   ``People are responsible for their behavior,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Pennsylvania. ``Even treatment
(programs) for this disorder ... also suggest the individual must
repay society for what they've done. It doesn't excuse them because
they have this disease.''

<HEAD>Second Ethiopian Rebel Group Accepts Carter's Mediation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second rebel group in Ethiopia has
accepted former President Jimmy Carter as an observer in peace talks
and called on the Ethiopian government to ``respond quickly'' to the
proposal.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front made the announcement in a
clandestine radio broadcast.
   ``The TPLF fears that the talks can be delayed while looking for
observers and, therefore, accepts former American President Jimmy
Carter, who has expressed his readiness to be an observer at the
talks,'' the group said Monday.
   Carter already is to act as an observer in peace talks between
Ethiopia's government and another rebel group, the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, scheduled to begin in Atlanta on Sept. 7.
   The Eritreans, in Ethiopia's northernmost Eritrea province, have
been fighting for independence since 1961.
   The Tigrean rebels, in neighboring Tigray province, took up arms
14 years ago to press for increased autonomy for their region.
   Early this year, they scored several major victories and forced
troops out of five towns, including the provincial capital of
Mekele, 470 miles northwest of Addis Ababa.
   Both rebel groups agreed to peace talks following President
Mengistu Haile Mariam's announcement in June that the government had
no preconditions and welcomed an independent observer.
   In its broadcast, the Tigre People's Liberation Front accused the
government of failing to respond to a previous offer for talks ``in
order to complete preparations'' for a counterattack in Tigray
province.

   The nation's rate of death from breast cancer is
increasing and it's worse across the northern states, although
federal cancer specialists can't explain why.
   The annual death rate from breast cancer in the United States in
1986, the latest year available, was 32.8 per 100,000 women, up 5
percent from 1979's 31.1, the national Centers for Disease Control
reported Thursday.
   The mortality rate in 1986 was 12 percent higher for black women
than for white women.
   Breast cancer killed 40,534 women in the United States in 1986,
the CDC said. Still, the disease is survivable in most cases. The
National Cancer Institute estimates that 75 percent of breast cancer
patients live at least another five years.
   The CDC said Delaware, with an annual breast cancer death rate of
41 per 100,000 women, had a rate nearly double that of Hawaii, which
was lowest at 23 per 100,000.
   Each of the dozen states with the highest rates was in the
northern half of the country. In contrast, all but three of the
bottom dozen were in the South or Southwest.
   ``We don't know why that is,'' said Dr. Robert Hahn, a cancer
specialist with the Atlanta-based CDC. ``It likely has something to
do with the distribution of risk factors for breast cancer, but we
don't know which ones those are.''
   Overall, breast cancer death rates have increased for women born
in each succeeding decade in this century. For example, Hahn said,
women born in the 1930s are showing a higher rate than those born in
the '20s, whose rate was higher than those born in the teens.
   That trend is apparently continuing, Hahn said, although many
women born in this century are just entering _ or haven't yet
entered _ their years of greatest risk for breast cancer. The CDC
said more than half of all breast cancer deaths occur in women 65 or
older.
   Breast cancer's risk factors include family history and
childbearing at older ages. Another possible risk factor is a diet
high in animal fat, Hahn said, although some researchers question
that.
   CDC researchers believe at least 19 percent of the deaths
attributed to breast cancer could have been prevented if the victims
had undergone recommended mammograms, which screen for breast cancer.
   Women are seven times more likely to have mammograms if their
doctor urges it, but Hahn said that as many as nine out of 10
doctors don't follow the American Cancer Society's advice and
recommend the procedure.
   ``We think it's crucial for physicians to become informed of the
guidelines and recommend to their patients that they get screening
mammograms,'' he said.
   The American Cancer Society recommends that women 40 and over
have a breast exam every year. Women 40-49 also should have
mammograms every year or two, and the society advises that women 50
and older should have mammograms each year.
   Previous studies cited by the CDC have indicated that fewer than
three in 10 eligible women reported having a mammogram in the
previous year, and nearly half of women surveyed said no
professional had ever recommended they get a mammogram.

   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung and two
other opposition lawmakers were indicted today on charges connected
with a lawmaker's secret and illegal trip to Communist North Korea.
   Kim, head of the Party for Peace and Democracy, denounced the
indictments as political persecution and said all the charges
against him and others were fabricated to discredit his opposition
group.
   ``I have nothing to fear. I will squarely face trial,'' he told
supporters.
   Also today, leftist students students yelling ``Yankee go home!''
and ``Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' battled riot police with
iron bars, clubs, firebombs and rocks.
   Police firing tear gas from two armored vans clashed with about
l,000 students inside Seoul National University after the
demonstrators tried to march from the campus.
   Students demanded the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops, which
they claim hinder talks on unification with North Korea. They also
demanded the release of a radical female student who was jailed
after making an unauthorized trip to North Korea.
   Also today, about 400 radical students at Seoul's Hankuk
University of Foreign Studies battled police for two hours with
firebombs.
   No arrests or injuries were reported in the protests.
   Prosecutors charged in the indictments that Kim and two party
lawmakers failed to report National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won's
secret trip to North Korea last year, a violation of national
security laws.
   The three indicted politicians will not be jailed pending trial,
prosecutors said. If convicted, Kim, party floor leader Kim Won-ki
and Rep. Lee Chul-yong could be sentenced to up to five years in
prison.
   Kim Dae-jung said his trial may never take place because the
government knows it has no chance of winning the case.
   Suh was expelled from the party on June 28, the same day he was
arrested on charges of espionage, violating a ban on unauthorized
travel to North Korea and receiving $120,000 from North Korean
agents before and during his secret trip to Pyongyang last August.
   Prosecutors said they have evidence Kim Dae-jung knew about Suh's
trip in advance. The opposition leader denies the charge.
   Kim Dae-jung, 64, also was charged with violating the Foreign
Currency Control Law for allegedly receiving $10,000 from Suh, who
is said to have received it from North Korean agents.
   However, prosecutors said the opposition leader apparently did
not know the money came from North Korea, so the charge was limited
to a minor violation that requires anyone receiving foreign currency
to report it within 10 days.
   Kim Dae-jung said his party will hold a rally in the western city
of Bupyong on Saturday to protest what he called ``deliberate
political persecution.''
   The Seoul government prohibits unauthorized travel to North Korea.
   Also today, a Seoul appellate court reduced the sentence given to
the brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan to two years in prison
and a fine of $477,000 for embezzlement.
   Chun Ki-hwan, 55, was arrested last year for diverting $4.3
million in public money after he took over a Seoul fish market in
1985 with the help of government officials.
   He was convicted by a Seoul district court and sentenced to four
years' imprisonment and a fine of $1.5 million. He appealed the
guilty verdict.
   About a dozen members of Chun Doo-hwan's family have been linked
to corruption since he left office last year after a seven-year rule.
   The former president himself went into rural exile late last year
after publicly apologizing for corruption committed under his
administration.

   Twin sisters with histories of mental problems
smoked several cigarettes together on the roof of a building before
jumping six stories to their deaths, authorities said.
   ``There was nothing to indicate the women were thrown off,''
police Capt. Edward Voehl said.
   The 24-year-old twins, Valeria and Claudia Marmon, died Thursday
after plunging from the building in Brooklyn, police said.
   Their father, Bert Marmon, said Valeria was a recent outpatient
from New York Hospital, where she was recovering from an overdose of

   A worker who saw the sisters enter the building said it seemed
they were going to pass the building when they apparently entered on

   A man who sold crack cocaine to a woman in

for the attack but was sentenced to 40 to 60 years in prison.
   Anthony Sawyer and Susan Barbier, both 29, were convicted earlier

apologized at Thursday's sentencing.
   The victim, who now lives with her father, told Recorder's Court
Judge John Patrick O'Brien: ``The hour I spent with Anthony Sawyer
is the worst hour I have ever spent in my life.''
   Sawyer, 29, said he made the deal with Barbier because he was
addicted to crack. O'Brien, citing Sawyer's two previous rape
convictions, rejected that claim.
   Barbier, 29, faces sentencing Tuesday by Wayne County Circuit

   Frustrated by two years of inaction and red
tape, neighbors of an alleged crack house turned to small claims
court and successfully sued the building's owner.
   ``It was an act of desperation,'' said Gary Brady, one of 15
neighbors of Rose Jackson who filed the lawsuit, charging the house
was a nuisance and a threat to safety.
   Municipal Judge Joseph Desmond notified the plaintiffs Thursday
that each had been awarded $2,000 plus court costs of about $20. The
judge would not discuss his ruling because of the possibility of
appeal.
   Jackson maintained she had no control over her tenant.
   ``We complained to the cops, to the fire department, the city
building inspectors, the health department,'' said another neighbor,
Aloysius Johnson. ``I even complained to the archbishop's office,
but nothing. Zilch.''
   ``Cars parked outside at all hours, shots fired, fights,'' said
police Capt. Diarmuid Philpott. ``Narcotics officers made many
arrests, but it didn't reduce the problem.''

   Protestant extremists shot and
wounded a 28-year-old man in his home today, then chased him
upstairs where his children were sleeping and finished him off,
police said.
   John Anthony Maginn was watching television with his wife in
their living room when the gunmen shot him through a window, said a
police spokesman.
   He ran upstairs to escape, but the assailants broke in and
pursued him, shooting him several more times, said the spokesman,
who demanded anonymity. Maginn's four children, who were sleeping
upstairs, were uninjured.
   The shooting occurred shortly before 1 a.m. in Rathfriland, 25
miles southwest of Belfast, said the spokesman. A car found on fire
nearby was believed to have been used as an escape car.
   The outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, a Protestant extremist
group linked to the paramilitary Ulster Defense Association, claimed
responsibility for the killing. The police spokesman said the group
claimed in a statement that Maginn worked with the Irish Republican
Army.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to
oust the British from the predominantly Protestant province and
reunite it with the Republic of Ireland. The IRA is opposed by
pro-British extremist groups.

   A policeman whose mysterious disappearance a week
ago had prompted a manhunt turned up in Salt Lake City and told
police he had walked away because of stress in his personal life,
authorities said today.
   David Hayhurst, 39, was wearing his Denver police officer's
uniform when he showed up at a Salt Lake City convenience store
Thursday night and asked the clerk to call authorities.
   Investigators initially had feared Hayhurst, a 17-year veteran,
had met foul play while on routine patrol. His police cruiser was
found with the motor running, lights on and the driver's door open.
   But in recent days, they began to speculate that he might have
walked away from his life in Denver because of financial and
personal problems.
   Lt. Syd Elliott of the Salt Lake City Sheriff's Department said
Hayhurst told police he could not remember what happened to him
since Aug. 18.
   But Denver Police Chief Ari Zavaras said Hayhurst changed his
story upon questioning by two Denver police officers dispatched to
Salt Lake City. Hayhurst was returning to Denver with the officers
this morning.
   Zavaras told reporters that Hayhurst admitted he walked away from
his patrol car early the morning of Aug. 18, hopped on a motorcycle
and left Denver, planning never to return.
   ``He cited personal pressures and said he was under such pressure
that he just couldn't handle it anymore,'' Zavaras said.
   Zavaras said he has placed Hayhurst on paid administrative leave
and ordered him to undergo psychological and physical examinations.

   Western leaders quickly gave strong backing to
Poland's first non-Communist prime minister in more than 40 years,
and Moscow said it hoped its relations with the Warsaw government
would remain close.
   After Poland's lower house of Parliament elected Tadeusz
Mazowiecki to the post Thursday, President Bush promised ``our
strong support as (Mazowiecki) seeks to lead his country toward
economic recovery and democratic change.''
   Bush praised Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski's
``political wisdom in endorsing a government reflecting the genuine
will of the Polish people and Solidarity, under the leadership of
Lech Walesa, for its constructive role in helping bring about a new
beginning in Poland.''
   Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, who was visiting Bush,
said: ``You are seeing right now very positive and exciting
international developments.''
   But Communist Vietnam criticized the new government today,
condemning ``anti-socialist forces backed and abetted by the United
States and the West for fomenting a deep political crisis in
Poland.''
   A transcript of a commentary in the Communist Party newspaper
Nhan Danh, seen in Bangkok, said a fierce struggle was going on in
Poland between ``revolutionary and pro-socialist forces and ...
counterrevolutionary and anti-Socialist forces.
   ``Taking advantage of the increasing economic political
difficulties deliberately caused and aggravated by themselves, the
opposition ... aided by the United States and the West as well as
the (Roman Catholic) Church has been carrying out hectic activities,
blaming the (Communist) Party and Poland for the troubles and trying
to increase their influence on the people,'' it said.
   It said the ``complicated struggle'' in Poland will ``rally the
working class'' to fight anti-socialist forces and resolve the
``present crisis.''
   Mazowiecki was nominated as prime minister by Communist President
Wojciech Jaruzelski and approved by Polish lawmakers, including a
majority of the Communist delegation.
   In Rome, Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti sent a message of
congratulations and said he hoped Poland would ``consolidate its
democratic and reformist course.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri A. Gremitskikh said: ``We
shall regard Comrade Mazowiecki as our partner in the relations that
link our two countries.''
   The Council of Ministers, or Soviet cabinet, sent Mazowiecki a
cable of ``friendly congratulations,'' and added:
   ``We express the certainty that the traditional relations of
friendship and all-round cooperation between the Soviet Union and
Poland will continue developing on the basis of sovereign equality
and respect, mutual benefit and mutual responsibility.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent ``heartfelt best wishes''
to Mazowieck. ``I wish God's blessing on the tasks ... lying ahead
of you,'' Kohl said.
   He said added his government would ``do all in its power to
support you on the chosen path.''
   Kohl said he hoped for closer relations with Poland, especially
since 1989 is the 50th anniversary of Nazi Germany's invasion of
Poland and the start of World War II.
   ``I am convinced that our two countries in this year ... should
move closer together ... to smooth the way for a lasting
reconciliation between our two peoples,'' he wrote.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's message recalled
``with much pleasure'' her meeting with Mazowiecki in November, when
she visited Walesa and his colleagues in Gdansk, Poland.
   Her office said she reaffirmed ``Britain's readiness to help
Poland to achieve democracy and economic recovery,'' but listed what
she saw as the three main challenges facing Poland: ``The need to
form a government that truly reflects the will of the Polish people;
to take Poland along the path of democracy; to implement the
difficult decisions necessary to restore Poland's economic health.''
   Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson welcomed the latest
``development in the democratic process in Poland.''
   ``The new Polish government, it is true, has no easy task,'' he
said. ``It faces great and difficult problems, especially in the
economic sphere.''
   His government hoped for ``increased and deeper cooperation with
the new government in Warsaw, not the least concerning problems that
can be solved best through international cooperation.''

<HEAD>Frank: Homosexuality Irrelevant to Performance in Congress</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 5th graf, The lawmaker, with to show how two men
met</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who publicly
acknowledged his homosexuality two years ago, insists his sexual
preference is not relevant to the way he performs his job in
Congress.
   ``If you ask the direct question: `Are you gay?' the answer is:
Yes. So what?'' Frank said in May 1987 when he became the second
member of Congress to discuss his homosexuality in public. Gerry
Studds, a fellow Massachusetts Democrat, also is an acknowledged
homosexual.
   ``I don't think my sex life is relevant to my job,'' Frank said
at the time. ``But on the other hand I don't want to leave the
impression that I'm embarrassed about my life.''
   Frank, a five-term congressman, acknowledged today that he hired
a male prostitute as a personal employee but fired him after
becoming suspicious the man was selling sex from Frank's home on
Capitol Hill.
   The lawmaker said he met the man in 1985 through an
``escort-model'' advertisement in a Washington gay newspaper. He
admitted having paid for sex with the man, but said the relationship
later became one of friendship.
   Frank said he ``showed poor judgment'' in hiring the man, but had
no direct proof the man was engaging in prostitution from the
congressman's apartment.
   The liberal Democrat said he saw no reason why he should resign
from Congress or should not seek re-election in 1990.
   Frank, 49, was first elected to Congress in 1980 and re-elected
in Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District in November 1988 by a
70 percent to 30 percent margin over his Republican opponent,
Deborah Tucker.
   Frank, who is not married, contended in June 1987 that most of
his constituents don't care that he's homosexual.
   ``Hardly anyone is interested in the sex life of a boring,
middle-aged politician,'' Frank said. ``As long as a person is kind,
loving and caring, not much else matters.''
   In February 1988, he said ``voters care about performance in
office,'' not about personal issues such as sexual preference.
   But his homosexuality became enmeshed in controversy this summer
when the Republican National Committee mailed a memo comparing his
voting record with that of new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
   The memo, titled, ``Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet,'' said
Foley's voting record was as liberal as Frank's.
   Frank contended the memo was ``extraordinarily scurrilous'' and
implied he viewed it as an effort to portray Foley as homosexual.
Frank said he might reveal the identity of homosexual Republican
congressmen if such attacks on Democrats continued.
   The RNC aide who wrote the memo resigned and RNC Chairman Lee
Atwater apologized to Foley.
   Frank said he decided to acknowledge his homosexuality after
public scrutiny of the private lives of former Democratic
presidential candidate Gary Hart and the late U.S. Rep. Stewart B.
McKinney of Connecticut. Hart, who is married, was forced to
withdraw from the 1988 race after being linked with model Donna
Rice. McKinney died of AIDS in 1987.
   Frank has worked for approval of legislation requiring
replacement of low-income housing demolished under urban renewal, a
bill requiring special prosecutors to investigate alleged wrongdoing
by public officials, and legislation barring the government from
denying visas based on politics.
   ``We would have more money for health issues if it weren't for
increased defense spending,'' said Frank in July 1988.
   Regarding anti-abortion activists, he once said: ``Sure, they're
pro-life. They believe that life begins at conception and ends at
birth.''
   He also contended the Reagan administration ignored the AIDS
issue.
   Frank is a member of the House Government Operations subcommittee
on housing and employment, which is investigating the
influence-peddling scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Born in Bayonne, N.J., Frank was executive assistant to Boston
Mayor Kevin White and an administrative assistant to Rep. Michael J.
Harrington, D-Mass., before being elected to the Massachusetts House
of Representatives in 1973.
   He served in the state Legislature until he was elected to
Congress.
   Frank earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1962 and his
law degree in 1977 from Harvard Law School.

<DATELINE>CLEWISTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida woman was jailed for two days
and her sons were put into a foster home when authorities in two
states mistook her for a West Virginia woman who fled with her two
sons after losing a custody battle.
   Not only do Melissa Dobbins, of Clewiston, and her 8- and
6-year-old sons bear striking resemblances to Lori Butcher and her
children, but the boys have the same names _ Joe and Nathan _ and
are about the same age, West Virginia police said.
   Mrs. Butcher disappeared with her two sons from Huntington,
W.Va., two years ago in defiance of a court order awarding the sons'
custody to their father.
   Mrs. Dobbins _ a large-boned woman with a Southern accent and
light brown hair _ matches Mrs. Butcher's description.
   ``I'm still not believing it happened,'' Mrs. Dobbins said
Thursday after finally getting her boys back. ``They put me through
torture.''
   Mrs. Dobbins' nightmare began in early August. A Clewiston
teacher spotted pictures of the Butcher boys on a missing children's
poster, noticed they looked like the Dobbins boys and notified
police.
   Clewiston police notified police in Huntington, confirming the
mothers' resemblance and the boys' resemblance _ and identical names
and ages.
   Huntington police then obtained a fugitive warrant from the FBI
charging Mrs. Dobbins _ whom they thought was Mrs. Butcher _ with
child concealment.
   Mrs. Dobbins was arrested Aug. 18 while visiting her husband at
South Miami Hospital, where he had undergone gall-bladder surgery.
   ``I said, `I'm not her. I'm Melissa Dobbins,''' Mrs. Dobbins
recounted. ``They didn't believe me.''
   ``I don't think we did anything wrong to apologize for,'' said
Huntington police Sgt. Darrell Black. ``I'm sorry if we put them
out. We were going on police instincts.''
   After being fingerprinted, strip-searched and booked at Dade
County Jail, she finally got to a telephone _ 12 hours later.
   That was when she discovered that state Health and Rehabilitative
Services workers had taken her children and put them in a temporary
home.
   The frightened boys also told authorities they were making a
mistake. ``I was scared I wouldn't see my mom again,'' Joe said.
   On Saturday, Ray Buck, an attorney from Tennessee, where Mrs.
Dobbins once lived, spent all day on the phone trying to convince
the FBI and police they had the wrong woman.
   Police finally checked to see whether Mrs. Dobbins had Mrs.
Butcher's markings _ a butterfly tattoo and two Caesarean scars. She
did not, and police freed her Sunday.
   But Black then decided Mrs. Dobbins could have been a baby sitter
for the missing Butcher boys, and the HRS refused to release the
Dobbins brothers.
   It took two more days of legal wrangling, including exchanges of
photographs between police in Huntington and in Florida, before the
boys were returned to their parents.
   ``The court system shouldn't work this way,'' Buck said. ``People
are entitled to better treatment than this.''

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Up for Second Straight Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rose 1.2 percent in
July, posting the first back-to-back increase after high mortgage
rates produced consecutive declines in the first five months of
1989, a real estate trade group reported today.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.40 million units in July, up from June's revised 3.36 million
units.
   June's increase was the first in sales since December 1988 and
the largest since December 1986, when sales jumped 6.6 percent.
   ``The downswing in (mortgage interest) rates is pulling some
buyers off the sidelines,'' said NAR President Ira Gribin.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported that average
fixed-rate mortgages fell from 10.03 percent to 9.81 percent during
July.
   The Realtors also reported the median price of a home rose $3,000
to $96,400, a 3.2 percent increase over June and 6.3 percent over
the previous year. The median price means half the homes cost more,
half less.
   The median price reflects the dominance of higher-priced home
sales, said NAR chief economist John A. Tuccillo, and ``a relatively
low volume of sales in the lower-priced starter range.''
   ``The loss of the entry-level buyer is taking a bite out of the
market,'' Gribin added.
   But while the July increase in sales was small, said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America, ``taken in the context of all other recent economic
indicators, it's got to be encouraging. I think we'll see more
moderate rises as the year goes on.''
   Regionally, sales were led in the Northeast, where the resale
pace rose 9.8 percent to 560,000 units. Next was the South, which
recorded a 3.1 percent increase to 1.32 million units.
   In the West, however, sales fell 5 percent to 570,000 units.
Sales also dropped in the Midwest, 5.2 percent to 910,000 units.
   Median prices were $147,000 in the Northeast, $88,200 in the
South, $138,200 in the West and $73,500 in the Midwest.

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebels said today that 77
government troops and six rebels were killed in heavy fighting this
week. The casualty toll was one of the highest reported since a
cease-fire was declared in Angola in June.
   In a statement released in Lisbon, the UNITA rebels said 19
rebels were injured in the clashes that occurred earlier this week
in the central and southern provinces of Cuand-Cubango, Cunene,
Huambo and South Cuanza.
   The statement said the rebels shot down a Soviet-built Mi-25
helicopter, destroyed four tanks and several combat vehicles, and
captured arms and ammunition in the fighting. There was no
independent confirmation of the attacks from the government in
Luanda.
   Last week, UNITA claimed government warplanes killed 150 people
in a raid on Mavinga. Casualty reports are often exaggerated by both
sides and news organizations are rarely able to verify them.
   A source close to the government said in a telephone interview
that Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Maria Tonha would meet later
today with his Zairean counterpart along the border in Angola's
northeastern corner.
   The source could not confirm the purpose of the meeting but said
he expected an official statement to be released.
   Cooperation between Angola and Zaire has increased recently since
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire began mediating in Angola's
civil war before a summit of 18 African leaders at Gbadolite on June
22.
   The summit produced a historic handshake between Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
that sealed a short-lived truce in their 14-year-old civil war.
   The truce began collapsing one week later and was formally
renounced Thursday by Savimbi. He acted after seven African leaders
met Tuesday in Harare, Zimbabwe, and supported dos Santos' claims
that Savimbi had accepted a ``temporary and voluntary retirement''
from Angola during peace negotiations.
   Western-backed UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, have been fighting the
government and its Cuban allies to force a power-sharing agreement
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   UNITA was not party to U.S.-brokered international accords signed
in New York in which South Africa pledged to halt aid to the
guerrillas and allow Angola's southern neighbor Namibia to gain
independence. In return, Cuba began a phased withdrawal of its
estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.
   UNITA still receives $15-$18 million annually in U.S. military
aid.

   Security agents found an Israeli gold merchant
in a well today after he was kidnapped by masked Palestinians in the
West Bank, officials said. One kidnap suspect was arrested.
   Shaul Mishaniya, 47, who reportedly went to the West Bank to
collect debts, was located by Shin Bet secret service agents during
a search involving helicopters and hundreds of soldiers and police.
   ``I am healthy, thank God, and thank you to the Israeli army and
all the soldiers who helped me,'' Mishaniya said on Israel radio.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of troops in the West
Bank, also said on the radio that Mishaniya had been held in the
well after being brought to an Arab village near Tulkarem.
   ``We found the well and brought him out, and I identified him and
he is all right,'' Mordechai said.
   Army officials said Mishaniya was found standing in about 5 feet
of water at the bottom of a 20-foot-deep well in the Arab village of
Abush.
   Mishaniya said he had been taken from a taxi by unknown men
Wednesday night. ``I didn't know them, and I don't know their
names,'' he said.
   The radio said he had spoken to his family in Tel Aviv.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy military spokesman, said Shin Bet
agents were led to the scene by an Arab suspect who was captured
Thursday. He said other suspects were being sought.
   ``The motive is not known. The investigation is looking into
whether it is political or criminal or both,'' said Gissin.
   Mishaniya was the first Israeli civilian abducted during the
20-month-old Palestinian uprising, prompting speculation that
underground leaders had opted for new tougher tactics as part of
their revolt against Israeli occupation.
   However, officials also said they were investigating possible
criminal motives for his kidnapping.

   A Soviet envoy who met with Christian and
Moslem leaders called today for a cease-fire in Lebanon and said the
warring factions should lift blockades on each other's ports.
   French radio stations reported today that ships of the U.S. Sixth
Fleet were anchored about 50 miles off Lebanon in the eastern
Mediterranean, the same distance as a French flotilla of warships.
   Pro-Iranian groups have threatened to attack the French ships if
they intervene militarily in Lebanon. France says it sent the ships
to Lebanon to evacuate French nationals if the fighting worsens.
   In Moscow, a Soviet foreign ministry spokesman denied French
radio reports that the Soviet missile launcher Kirov was headed to
join other Soviet warships in the area. ``There are no Soviet
military vessels off Lebanon's coast,'' spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh
said. He said ``no Soviet military vessels are heading to Lebanon's
shores.''
   Lebanon's Communist Voice of the People radio station in Lebanon
said Sixth Fleet vessels visiting the Israeli port of Haifa were
coordinating activity with the French task force. It did not
elaborate.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beirut declined comment on the reports. The
Pentagon said in Washington that the Sixth Fleet was not engaged in
unusual activities and that its ships have not teamed up with those
of the French flotilla. The Pentagon declined to say precisely where
the U.S. fleet was located.
   Police said one person was killed and four wounded in overnight
and early morning clashes between Syrian and Christian forces in
Beirut and in the mountains southeast of the capital.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll from five months of
fighting between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mostly Christian
troops and Syrian forces with their Moslem militia allies to 792
killed and 2,218 wounded.
   The conflict began March 8 after Aoun blockaded Moslem-run ports
south of Beirut. Syria and its Moslem allies retaliated by shelling
and besieging the Christian heartland and ports north of Beirut.
   Soviet envoy Gennady Tarasov met today with Maronite Catholic
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir in Bkirki, north of Beirut, before driving
to Beirut's eastern Baabda suburb for a meeting with Aoun.
   He told reporters his talks were ``useful,'' adding: ``The
patriarch and I agreed that the time is ripe for a political
solution.''
   ``Everything should be discussed politically and far from
military solutions... A cease-fire should go into effect and
blockades should be lifted,'' Tarasov said without elaborating.
   The Soviet envoy walked the last 500 yards along a shell-pitted
road to the hilltop presidential palace, where Aoun has his
headquarters in an underground bunker. The two-story palace has come
under heavy Syrian shelling since Aoun declared a ``war of
liberation'' to drive out the Soviet-equipped Syrian army.
   Syria claims to be in complete harmony with the Soviets over the
Lebanon crisis, but Arab diplomats have reported serious differences
between Moscow and Damascus, which has refused Arab appeals to
withdraw from Lebanon. The Syrians also refuse to negotiate directly
with Aoun.
   Tarasov, who heads the Soviet foreign ministry's Middle East
department, held lengthy talks with Acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, after arriving Thursday in west Beirut.
   He refused to speak to reporters before the meeting with Sfeir.
But sources at Hoss' Moslem cabinet, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tarasov was promoting a comprehensive peace plan to
halt the confrontation and begin a political dialogue among Lebanese
leaders to end the 14-year civil war.
   Tarasov discussed the Lebanese situation with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa in Damascus on Wednesday. The two nations
are bound by a treaty of friendship and cooperation.
   Sheik Sobhi Tofeili of Hezbollah, or Party of God, said the
pro-Iranian radical Shiite group was ``in a state of war with the
French forces.''
   ``We shall practice our right in this regard and defend ourselves
against the French who have declared war on us by coming close to
our coast,'' Tofeili said in a statement carried today by An-nahar
and other publications.
   A previously unknown group calling itself the Organization for
the Defense of the Oppressed also pledged to ``confront the flagrant
French military intervention in internal Lebanese affairs.''
   The group, in a statement delivered to a Western news agency in
Beirut, said its ``Mujahedeen (holy warriors) are ready to carry out
God's verdict in striking at western interests, topped by French
interests.''
   France has said its six-ship flotilla was sent on a
``humanitarian'' mission to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 French
nationals living in Lebanon if the situation deteriorated.
   However, Syria's allies claimed the French warships were on a
mission to support Aoun's troops in the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave.

   Four young white men were charged today with
being part of a gang accused of killing one black teen-ager and
chasing three others from a white neighborhood with baseball bats.
   The gang of as many as 30 white youths, intent on preventing an
interracial couple from meeting, attacked the black teen-agers
Wednesday night as they were going to meet someone selling a used
car, authorities said.
   The killing of Yusef Hawkins, 16, was reminiscent of the 1986
Howard Beach case, in which a group of white teen-agers in the
Howard Beach section of Queens chased three blacks, one of whom was
hit by a car and killed.
   In Brooklyn's mostly Italian-Jewish Bensonhurst section Wednesday
night, the white gang gathered to waylay blacks or Hispanics they
believed were headed for a young white woman's birthday party in the
neighborhood, authorities said.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said the 18-year-old woman had
recently jilted her white boyfriend and had been dating black and
Hispanic men.
   The spurned boyfriend had threatened the girl and made comments
to her about ``your nigger boyfriend'' and ``bringing niggers into
the neighborhood,'' said Deputy Commissioner Alice McGillion.
   The slain youth's father stood Thursday night on his own Brooklyn
street, which is mostly black, and laid the blame squarely on racism.
   ``My son will never turn this corner again and it's only because
of this: the pigment of his skin,'' Fred Stewart said bitterly.
   Four young Brooklyn men whom police believe were part of the gang
were taken into custody. Keith Mondello, 18; Steven Curreri, 18;
Pasquale Raucci, 19, and Charles Stressler, 21 were charged today
with assault, riot, aggravated harassment, violation of civil
rights, menacing and possessing a weapon, said Sgt. Norris Hollomon.
The weapon was a bat.
   Mondello and Curreri also were charged with conspiracy, Hollomon
said. Police said none of those arrested fired the shots that killed
the victim.
   Police said the former boyfriend was being sought for questioning.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, with Ward at a news conference Thursday,
called the killing ``an enormous tragedy.''
   Other candidates in New York City's Sept. 12 mayoral primary
issued statements deploring the killing.
   David Dinkins, in a virtual dead heat with Koch for the
Democratic nomination, said he accused no one of causing the racial
violence but added: ``The tone and climate of this city does get set
at City Hall.''
   Hawkins and his friends, Troy Banner and Claude Stanford, both
18, and Luther Sylvester, 17, went into the neighborhood to answer a
newspaper ad for a used car.
   Ward said the whites followed the blacks for about a block and a
half and witnesses heard them say: ``Are these the ones? Is this
them?''
   What they didn't know was that the girlfriend had told her new
boyfriend, a Hispanic, not to come and called off her birthday
party, McGillion said.
   McGillion said the girl, Gina Feliciano, saw the killing from her
window.
   ``She knew there was going to be trouble. There were rumblings in
the neighborhood. Her mother had looked out the window and saw the
boys with the bats,'' McGillion said.
   When the white gang stopped and confronted the blacks, four shots
were heard. Hawkins fell with two shots in the chest. Banner had an
injury to the arm, but it wasn't known whether it was from a grazing
bullet or a blow, police said. The other two were unhurt.
   The gang scattered. When police arrived they found four
.32-caliber shells and several bats nearby. No gun was recovered
despite police searches of a parked car and sewers.
   ``This neighborhood is definitely prejudiced. They don't like
blacks. They don't like Puerto Ricans,'' said Joanne Carretta, a
26-year-old lifelong Bensonhurst resident.
   Others said Bensonhurst was no more prejudiced than other
communities.
   Yet, one teen-age girl standing not far from where Hawkins was
killed said: ``The black people don't belong here. ... This is our
neighborhood.''
   Bensonhurst was the scene of a racial incident on Christmas Day
1987 in which two black men were allegedly beaten by a gang of white
youths while they collected bottles in a shopping cart. Two arrests
were made in the attack, which spawned a protest march through the
neighborhood by 400 blacks as angry white residents jeered and
shouted ``Howard Beach!'' at the participants.

   Police have arrested three people in the
slaying of George Adamson, the British conservationist known as the
Lion Man of Kenya, the governing party newspaper reported today.
   The Kenya Times said police arrested the three men in the
northern Kora National Reserve. It did not say when the arrests
occurred. Authorities began searching the area Sunday after Adamson
and two assistants were shot and killed in an encounter with three
robbers armed with automatic rifles.
   Adamson trained lions born in captivity to return to the wild.
   The Times, owned by the ruling Kenya African National Union, said
police were interrogating the suspects and planned to parade them
before Adamson's workers who witnessed the shooting for possible
identification.
   Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo was not immediately available
for comment, and Richard Leakey, the director of wildlife
management, said he had no way to confirm or deny the report.
   Adamson's slaying was the third fatal attack in Kenya's wilds
since July. Publicity surrounding his death and the slayings of an
American woman and a French couple threatens to harm Kenya's tourism
industry, the country's number one foreign exchange earner.
   Officials say travel is basically safe. They blame the recent
violence partly on a massive effort to save Kenya's elephants, which
they say has driven well-armed poachers into other forms of banditry.
   Adamson, 83, earned international fame by his efforts along with
his wife Joy to return lions to the wild. Their achievements were
detailed in the film ``Born Free'' and a sequel, ``Living Free.''
Both movies were based on books by Joy, who was killed at the
northwestern Shamba Game Reserve in 1980 by a servant she had
dismissed on suspicion of theft.
   Adamson moved into Kora National Reserve in 1971 and helped
dozens of lions learn to survive in the bush before turning them
loose.
   He and Joy, who separated in the late 1960, had no children.
   Leakey said Adamson, whose body was flown to Nairobi Aug. 21,
would be buried with honors at Kora National Reserve next week.

   A former aide to hotel queen Leona Helmsley was
unfairly charged in a tax evasion and extortion scheme in an attempt
to bring down his boss, a lawyer argued today in closing arguments.
   ``He was swept up in order to get at Mrs. Helmsley,'' attorney
William Brodsky said. ``Frank Turco was a man who was up front'' in
the Helmsley organization.
   Turco, who was Mrs. Helmsley's top aide and is now her
co-defendant, is also charged with conspiracy to commit extortion.
Brodsky discounted the allegation that Turco forced liquor
salespeople to make kickbacks to keep accounts at the Helmsley
hotels. He called Turco a tough-talking executive who merely
negotiated rebates or discounts to get Mrs. Helmsley the best
possible price.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita planned to deliver the
government's rebuttal later today.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is accused of evading $1.2 million in federal
taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations at her
Connecticut estate, to her businesses.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Helmsley's lawyer spent eight hours dissecting
the government's case against her, then wrapped up his closing
argument with an emotional plea for acquittal.
   ``Please end the suffering, the terrible suffering of Mrs.
Helmsley and let her walk out of this courthouse a free woman,'' the
attorney, Gerald Feffer, said Thursday.
   Mrs. Helmsley cried and appeared shaken after Feffer told the
jury it would be a mistake to vote a conviction on any of the 41
counts on which she is charged.
   He told the jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that many of
the prosecution witnesses who had worked for her had a motivation to
testify against her.
   ``Mrs. Helmsley had a lot of enemies and these people came here
to pay her back,'' Feffer said. ``These people had an agenda and
that agenda was to get her.''
   Turco and another former aide, Joseph Licari, are charged with
assisting in the scheme.
   The charges against Mrs. Helmsley include conspiracy to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service, tax evasion, filing false returns,
mail fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion.
   The extortion conspiracy charge carries a maximum 20-year prison
sentence upon conviction. The other charges carry three- to
five-year sentences.
   Feffer, who made Mrs. Helmsley's harsh personality an issue
during the trial, told the jurors to disregard the stories of her
wrath.
   ``If in fact she mistreated people, I beg you ladies and
gentlemen to leave that decision to a higher authority,'' he said.
   The defense attorney also brushed aside testimony from Mrs.
Helmsley's former housekeeper, who said Mrs. Helmsley once told her,
``We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.''
   He said the statement made no sense because Leona and Harry
Helmsley paid $57.8 million in federal taxes in 1983-85, the years
covered in the indictment.
   ``I can see her complaining about all the taxes she did pay. That
would be more like Mrs. Helmsley,'' Feffer said.
   On Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy Seibel said the
statement showed Mrs. Helmsley's ``selfishness, greed and sheer
arrogance.''
   After Feffer's argument, Joseph Benfante, Licari's lawyer, argued
his client's innocence with humor.
   He had the entire courtroom laughing as he focused on the tense
relationship between Mrs. Helmsley and Licari.
   ``Joseph Licari was Mr. Helmsley's Jiminy Cricket, his
conscience,'' Benfante said. ``He'd tell Mr. Helmsley she's spending
his money again and she'd go nuts.''
   He described Licari as a respected, trusted and honest employee.
   ``He would not be part of a fraud, even if there was one,'' he
said.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr. said he expected
deliberations to begin late today or Saturday morning.

   The proportion of women in the world's parliaments
dropped to 12.7 percent by the end of June, close to the level of 15
years ago, according to a survey.
   At the start of last year, the figure was 14.6 percent, according
to figures published Thursday by the Geneva-based
Inter-Parliamentary Union.
   Sweden's Parliament has the highest proportion of female
legislators, 38.1 percent, a rise from 30.1 percent in January 1988,
a summary of the survey said. Norway and Romania were listed next
with 34.4 percent each, followed by Cuba, East Germany, Finland and
Denmark.
   Sharp drops were registered in the Soviet Union, where the
percentage fell from 34.5 to 15.3 after elections in March, and in
Poland, where the proportion dropped from 20.2 to 13.3 percent. In
France, the share of women deputies declined from 6.4 to 5.7
percent, the survey said.
   In Venezuela and Bolivia, the percentage more than doubled in the
18 months surveyed. Rises were also listed for Ecuador, Mexico and
Canada.
   As of June 30, 3,937 out of 31,055 parliamentarians in 130
countries were women _ a figure almost as low as the 12.5 percent
recorded in 1975, the group said.

   Prime Minister Bob Hawke ordered
military planes to begin carrying civilians after mass resignations
by the nation's airline pilots grounded all domestic service.
   Hawke also said he would allow international airlines to carry
domestic passengers in an attempt to break one of the most bitter
labor disputes in recent Australian history.
   ``If we cave in to the pilots' demands Australia is dead,'' Hawke
said on Thursday.
   The domestic airline industry shut down Thursday as carriers
began dismissing pilots for not honoring their contracts. All 1,600
pilots retaliated by resigning en masse.
   The pilots went on strike Aug. 18, refusing to work beyond the
hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. They are demanding a 30 percent wage
increase, which Hawke says will raise annual salaries to $100,000.
   The Labor government has called the raise unacceptable because of
a wage-and-income policy limiting increases to 6 percent.
   Most international airlines, meanwhile, agreed to provide seats
for domestic passengers for the Australian segments of international
flights.

<TEXT>
   A cocaine-addicted mother convicted of
delivering drugs to her two babies through the bloodstream was
sentenced today to 15 years' probation and completion of a drug
treatment program.
   Jennifer Johnson, who faced a maxium 30-year prison sentence,
must remain free of drugs, receive periodic testing, complete a high
school equivalency education and meet other terms of a lengthy
probation program imposed by Seminole County Circuit Judge O.H. Eton
Jr.
   Ms. Johnson, 23, was convicted July 12 of delivering drugs to her
newborns under a criminal drug-dealing law rarely applied in such
cases.
   She was convicted in a non-jury trial of delivering drugs through
the children's umbilical cords at birth. In his ruling, the judge
determined that the cocaine passed from her body into the babies at
birth, but before their umbilical cords were severed.
   Ms. Johnson's attorney, James Sweeting, who has said he would
appeal the conviction, called the sentence ``tough for her to meet.
... It's not excessive for the crime for which she was convicted,
but we do not think she should have gone to trial on that charge.''
   Ms. Johnson, who is at a drug program that runs 12 to 16 months,
did not speak during the sentencing except to tell the judge she
understood the terms.

   The Philippine Senate will not ratify
a treaty extending U.S. military bases after 1991 without strong
pressure from President Corazon Aquino, a prominent opposition
lawmaker said today.
   The United States maintains Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller installations under an agreement that expires
in September 1991. Talks are expected to begin late this year on
extending the agreement.
   Mrs. Aquino refuses to say whether she supports a new agreement,
which must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate. On
Thursday, 12 senators called for closing the bases in 1991, showing
the Aquino administration lacks the votes for ratification.
   The Liberal Party, the most dominant political group in the
Senate, announced after a two-hour closed-door meeting late today
that it would oppose any extension of the bases treaty.
   Senate President Jovito Salonga, the Liberal Party's president,
said his party will ask U.S. officials to withdraw their troops and
dismantle the bases upon the expiration of the treaty.
   He said the party also will conduct a nationwide information
campaign against the bases.
   Eight of the 23 senators belong to the Liberal Party, making it
the most dominant group in the upper chamber.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense minister and one of the
resolution's co-sponsors, told foreign reporters he believes all 12
co-signers are strongly committed to closing the bases.
   ``Unless President Aquino exerts her power and influence over her
coalition members, I think that the 11 will stay committed to the
resolution,'' said Enrile, the Senate's only opposition member.
``For myself I know how I will vote, and there are no `ifs' and
`buts' about that.''
   The United States claims the bases are essential for maintaining
security in the Far East. Filipino opponents claim the bases are a
vestige of U.S. colonial rule and infringe on national sovereignty.
   Enrile said the resolution was aimed at pressing Mrs. Aquino into
notifying the United States that the bases will not be extended.
That would give Washington time to relocate its forces elsewhere in
the Pacific and for the Philippines to find alternative uses for the
facilities, he said.
   ``I think that the 11 other members who cosigned the resolution
with me seem to be very committed in what was stated in the
resolution, that the Military Bases Agreement should not be extended
beyond ... 1991,'' Enrile said.
   He suggested that Manila's international airport be relocated to
Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of the capital. Enrile said he
believed the United States could remove its 40,000 service members,
military dependents and civilian employees within six months.
   In the resolution, the 12 senators ruled out a phased withdrawal
that would last beyond 1991, as called for by some Filipino
lawmakers.
   ``Whereas to be fair to all concerned, the undersigned manifest
that they are opposed to any further extension of the presence of
foreign military bases in our country beyond 1991,'' the resolution
says.
   In October 1988, the United States agreed to pay $481 million a
year to keep the bases until 1991. Filipino officials had asked for
$2 billion and are expected to press for more money during future
talks.
   The issue is expected to figure in talks during Mrs. Aquino's
visit to Washington in November. The bases provide jobs to about
70,000 Filipinos and pay more than $96 million annually in civilian
salaries.

   Two markers have been placed at the site
of a fiery church bus crash that claimed 27 lives last year.
   The Rev. Don Tennison began trying to get a marker placed at the
site in April. Many of the members of his church, First Assembly of
God in Radcliff, are family and friends of the victims.
   They were angered when they learned a state highway crew on March
28 had removed a makeshift memorial of two crosses surrounded by
flowers in the median.
   The markers, on both sides of Interstate 71, are typical highway
markers, green with white lettering, and say ``SITE OF FATAL BUS
CRASH MAY 14, 1988.''
   A final decision on the markers was made Wednesday by the state
department's chief engineer, Gilbert Newman, after he met with state
Sen. Virgil Pearman and Tennison, to whom the markers were presented.
   Tennison learned from state officials that the earlier memorial
had been designated a traffic hazard because drivers had been
slowing to look at it.
   The markers erected Thursday were approved by the Federal Highway
Administration, said Angela Siegel, spokeswoman for the state
Transportation Department.
   Ms. Siegel said there was no ceremony for the 44-by-72-inch
markers' installation, ``because if we made a big deal, we might
create a traffic hazard.''
   The crash occurred when the bus, owned by the Radcliff church,
was hit by a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on the interstate.
Larry Mahoney, the pickup's driver, was charged with 27 counts of
murder and drunken driving in the accident. His trial is scheduled
to begin in November.

   More than 450 U.S. military
personnel and their spouses filled a chapel Friday to remember the
70 people killed a year ago during an air show accident.
   ``The thoughts and prayers of the men and women of the U.S. Air
Forces in Europe are with those who lost loved ones or suffered
during the tragedy,'' said Gen. Michael J. Dugan, the head of the
U.S. Air Force in Europe. ``We must never lose sight of the human
dimension of tragic events, and must always act our caring in
responsible ways.''
   Earlier, Brig. Gen. Lawrence E. Boese, commander of the nearby
Kaiserslautern military community, placed a wreath at a stone marker
outside the chapel that is dedicated to the victims of last year's
disaster.
   The accident occurred on Aug. 28, 1988, when planes of an Italian
stunt-flying team collided over the air base, sending a jet engulfed
in flames plowing into the crowd. Four of the dead were Americans,
and 61 were West Germans. About 450 people were injured.

   F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's acting
president, and Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko agreed at a summit
meeting today to cooperate in trying to salvage a collapsing peace
agreement in war-torn Angola.
   De Klerk, on his first diplomatic mission since assuming the
presidency Aug. 15, conferred with Mobutu for nearly three hours at
a resort on the shores of Lake Kivu. His trip was the latest in a
series of forays into black Africa by white South African officials
seeking to ease their country's isolation.
   The two men gave no indication of any breakthroughs following the
talks, which were described in a joint communique as ``positive,
opportune and constructive, particularly at this critical state of
developments in Angola.''
   They refused to answer any questions.
   An official close to the talks, who requested anonymity,
suggested South Africa and Zaire would try to keep the peace process
alive by serving as intermediaries between Angola's Marxist
government and the UNITA rebels.
   Mobutu has been spearheading efforts to negotiate a settlement of
Angola's civil war, and South Africa has endorsed his initiative
after ending its material support for the Angolan rebel movement,
knwon as UNITA.
   In the joint communique, Mobutu and de Klerk said they discussed
the ``delicate situation'' in Angola and agreed to work to get the
peace process back on track.
   The communique, read by South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha,
said the two leaders agreed there should be a ``follow-up'' to
today's discussions.
   De Klerk, leader of South Africa's governing National Party, is
favored to win election to a five-year term as president after
parliamentary elections on Sept. 6. He became acting president Aug.
15 after P.W. Botha resigned, angered by de Klerk's plans for a
meeting Monday with Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.
   Mobutu was expected to press de Klerk for details about his
promises to reform South Africa's apartheid policies.
   De Klerk has proposed a five-year plan to extend political rights
to blacks. But he has indicated he wants to maintain white veto
power over major decisions and to continue with segregated
neighborhoods and schools for whites.
   De Klerk met Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano in July.
   Botha met last year with four black African leaders, including
Mobutu, in a bid to ease South Africa's isolation on the continent.
   Prior to those trips, Botha had not traveled abroad for a summit
meeting with any African leader since coming to power in 1978.
   South Africa has improved its standing in Africa with its
decision to grant independence to Namibia, the neighboring territory
it has ruled for 74 years.
   South Africa agreed to Namibian independence in December when it
signed a regional peace treaty with the Marxist Angolan government
and its Cuban allies.
   The accord calls for a phased withdrawal of Cuba's 50,000 troops
from Angola, where they have assisted in the fighting against UNITA
_ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Mobutu hosted an African summit June 22 in which the Angolan
government and UNITA agreed to a cease-fire. Since then, he has
mediated sporadic negotiations between the two sides. However, UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi said Thursday that the truce was over and told
his rebel forces to prepare for further fighting.
   And today, UNITA issued a statement saying 77 government troops
and six of its rebels were killed in heavy fighting in Angola this
week.
   South Africa supported UNITA until December's peace treaty.
   The United States still aids the rebels, and some of the
assistance is routed through Zaire. UNITA has been fighting since
1975 for a power-sharing agreement with the Angolan government.

   Rep. Barney Frank said today he hired a male
prostitute as a personal employee but fired him two years ago when
he became suspicious the man was selling sex from Frank's Capitol
Hill apartment.
   ``I was victimized,'' Frank, D-Mass., said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press.
   ``I knew he had been a prostitute. ... I was trying to get him to
stop. I didn't know he was expanding his business. From firsthand
knowledge I (still) don't know that,'' said Frank, 49, a liberal
Democrat who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in May 1987.
   During a news conference later at his office in this Boston
suburb, Frank said he had shown poor judgement in hiring the man.
   ``Thinking I was going to be Henry Higgins and trying to turn him
into Pygmalion was the biggest mistake I ever made,'' he said. ``He
took me.''
   Frank said he met the man in 1985 through an ``escort-model''
advertisement in a Washington gay newspaper. The congressman
admitted paying for sex with the man one time, but said the
relationship quickly became one of friendship. He said he no longer
uses escort services.
   In a report in today's editions of The Washington Times, a man
identified as Greg Davis told the newspaper that Frank was aware
that sex was being sold from the congressman's apartment and was
concerned that it might be discovered.
   Frank called those allegations ``absolutely untrue.''
   ``His suggestion that he was procuring sex partners for me is a
lie,'' Frank also said.
   When asked if the revelations might force him to resign from
Congress, Frank replied: ``Of course not. Why should it?'' He said
he planned to run for re-election for a sixth term in 1990.
   ``I don't think I'm going to be heavily penalized by the voters
for being suckered by a guy I was trying to help,'' he said.
   ``I hired him out of a charitable impulse. I misjudged his
character. ... I think he was a pretty good con man,'' he said.
   Frank said he hired the man as a personal assistant to do work
around his house, drive his car and run errands. Frank said he paid
him about $20,000 a year for about a year and a half with personal
money. He said no government or campaign funds were used.
   Frank said he fired him in August 1987 after his landlady told
him for the second time that the man may have been arranging
liaisons at the apartment in Frank's absence.
   ``He was angry. He threatened me with a variety of retributions
and apparently he decided the way to to that was go to The
Washington Times,'' Frank said.
   In a companion story today, the Times reported that the principal
of an elementary school in the well-to-do Washington suburb of Chevy
Chase, Md., acknowledged that he had allowed Davis to use school
offices in 1987. School officials placed the principal on leave
after the story broke.
   The prostitute told the Times he used a telephone in the school
guidance counselor's office to arrange liaisons, but Principal
Gabriel Massaro denied to the newspaper that he knew what Davis was
doing.
   The newspaper said Davis was a professional name and it did not
disclose his real name, but Frank identified the man as Steve Gobie.
There was no telephone listing for Gobie in Washington or its
suburbs.
   ``He was a male prostitute and I thought ... that he was smart
enough to do something else,'' Frank said. ``I said he should get a
job. He said he was on probation and couldn't get a job because of
that.''
   The Times said the man's probation stemmed from four felony
convictions in 1982: possession of obscene material, production of
obscene items involving a juvenile, oral sodomy and possession of
cocaine. He also was convicted of cocaine distribution in 1975, the
newspaper said.
   ``I thought I could help him reform,'' Frank said.
   Frank said he wrote letters of reference on his congressional
stationery to the probation board to verify that Gobie was employed.
   The congressman said he knew that Gobie sometimes stayed at his
apartment when he was out of town and that he told Gobie there
should be no drugs there.
   ``But it never occurred to me to say don't engage in
prostitution,'' Frank said.
   Frank said he gave Gobie a couple of small jobs to do in 1987
after he complained about having a difficult time finding work, but
fired him after he ``tried to extort me'' and ``I ordered him not to
have any access to me.''
   ``Paying for sex, that's one of the things that led me to
acknowledge being gay,'' Frank said. ``Before, living as a closeted
gay man was difficult. ... It was one of the reasons I was
vulnerable to being preyed on.''
   Asked when was the last time he paid for sex, Frank replied:
``I'm not going to get into that.''
   He did say he has been in a monogamous homosexual relationship
for about two years.
   ``He's a very sensible person and a steadying influence,'' Frank
said about his partner.
   Frank's homosexuality became the subject of controversy this
summer when the Republican National Committee circulated a memo
comparing his voting record with that of new House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley.
   The memo, titled ``Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet,'' said
Foley's voting record was as liberal as Frank's. The RNC aide who
wrote the memo resigned and RNC Chairman Lee Atwater apologized to
Foley.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of video rental shops on Friday received
promotional kits for a horror movie with live snakes inside the
packages, and outraged animal protection officials called the stunt
``cruel and irresponsible.''
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals called
on Cinema International Corp. to take back the 700 reptiles.
   The snakes were in danger because instructions accompanying the
kits had incorrectly said they did not need to be fed for their
planned month-long stay in the stores, the society said.
   It said it was receiving dozens of calls from unhappy shop owners.
   Paul Brett, CIC's marketing manager, said the snakes were
intended to be kept in shops to promote a thriller about voodoo
called ``The Serpent and The Rainbow.''
   The snakes were bred domestically and the company began sending
them out Thursday from its London headquarters, he said.
   The snakes, silver with gray stripes, are not poisonous but might
carry harmful parasites if they came from abroad, said RSPCA
spokeswoman Diana Jones. They needed to be fed weekly, she said.
   While admitting there'd been ``some confusion,'' Cinema
International denied the snakes would harm anyone or be harmed.
   ``We've sent out 700 in clear, plastic, aerated boxes as
conversation pieces,'' Brett said. ``Snakes make wonderful pets.''
   The 18- to 24-inch snakes used in the promotion came from a
company called Animal Actors, which assured Cinema International
they did not have to be fed for three months, he said.
   Lawrence Cane, Cinema International's marketing assistant, said:
``Whenever we launch a new video title we normally send to our
distributors posters, sleeves and cardboard cut-outs. With this
film, we decided to send snakes. In marketing terms it's called live
points of sale.''
   Some recipients weren't impressed.
   ``We felt complete and utter horror,'' said a London video shop
manager, who refused to be identified to protect his relations with
the distribution company. ``I deplore any living creature used for
advertising.''
   He said the snake, which ``just appeared out of the blue,'' had
been returned to the distribution company's animal supplier.
   Brett said the snakes were hand-delivered in boxes marked ``Live
Animal,'' and claimed shop owners were warned by ads in the trade
press and calls from sales agents.
   At the end of the month, they were to be collected by the
company, although if shop owners were unhappy, they could call an
emergency number and have them picked up.
   ``I have spoken to three (shop owners) who were less than
happy,'' Brett said. ``If we find we were wrong about feeding, then
obviously we will take action on that and pull them back
immediately.''
   Ms. Jones said the RSPCA was urging unhappy owners to demand that
the company take them back, and if they didn't, the RSPCA might take
some.
   ``We don't have the resources to take care of hundreds of
snakes,'' she said.
   Robert Cottrill, assistant manager at Video Palace shop in
London's Soho district, said he didn't particularly mind the snake,
whom the staff immediately nicknamed ``Cyril,'' but thought the
whole stunt was ``cruel and crass.''
   ``It's a pretty second-rate film,'' he said. ``I think they knew
full well that all this would happen.''

<HEAD>Existing Home Sales Continued Rebound in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes continued their rebound
from high mortgage rates with a 1.2 percent increase in July, a real
estate trade group reported Friday, and analysts forecast continued
moderate growth the rest of the year.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.40 million
units in July. That compared with revised figures for June that
showed a 4.7 percent increase to 3.36 million units annually.
   The June-July rebound followed consecutive sales declines in the
first five months of the year.
   Although the July sales hike was relatively small, Chief
Economist Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America said ``taken in the context of all other recent economic
indicators, it's got to be encouraging.
   ``I think we'll see more moderate rises as the year goes on,'' he
said.
   The NAR is forecasting existing home sales to total 3.41 million
units this year, down 5 percent from 1988 in part because higher
costs are pricing the entry-level buyer out of the market.
   ``The downswing in rates is pulling some buyers off the
sidelines,'' said NAR President Ira Gribin, adding that ``the impact
of lower mortgage rates is likely to be steady trade-up sales,
rather than a sales surge among first-time buyers.''
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported that fixed-rate
mortgages fell from a peak of 11.22 percent in March to 9.81 percent
during July.
   The NAR said the median price of a home in July was $96,400,
which Realtors Chief Economist John A. Tuccillo said ``suggests a
relatively low volume of sales in the lower-priced starter range.''
   The median price _ meaning half the homes cost more, half less _
was up 3.2 percent from June and 6.3 percent from the previous year.
   ``The single largest percentage _ 13.8 percent _ of existing home
sales made nationwide in July came in the price category of $120,000
to $159,999,'' the NAR said.
   Regionally, the Northeast led sales with a 9.8 percent increase
to 560,000 units despite having the highest median price in the
nation, $147,900.
   It was followed by the South with a 3.1 percent increase to 1.32
million units. The median price there was $88,300.
   However the West, with a median price of $138,200, saw sales fall
5 percent to 570,000 units. The Midwest, with a median price of
$73,500, posted a sales decline of 5.2 percent to 910,000 units.

<HEAD>Falkland Islanders Divided About British-Argentine Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN LEONARD</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Falklanders have mixed feelings
about talks on restoring relations between Britain and Argentina,
which made their rocky, windswept archipelago a battleground seven
years ago.
   Most residents see negotiations as inevitable, but many fear a
deal that could cost them their British status. The first round is
scheduled for Oct. 17-18 in Madrid.
   About 1,800 people live on the bleak islands 300 miles east of
Argentina's tip. The main occupations are fishing and grazing sheep
on the chill moorlands.
   ``I think it's a bit worrying, really,'' said Nancy Poole.``How
far will they go? If they carry on, Argentina will think Britain is
saying yes to a transfer of sovereignty eventually, I would think.''
   Mrs. Poole is secretary of Desire the Right, the only organized
political party. It hs taken no official position on the talks and
Mrs. Poole said her views were personal.
   Charles Keenleyside, an elected member of the islands' executive
and legislative councils, welcomeed the talks.
   He said a briefing by William Fullerton, the colonial governor,
convinced him ``we are not moving into a situation where items are
being discussed that are specifically against the wishes of the
Falkland Islanders.''
   Keenleyside added, however, that many people oppose any
resumption of links with Argentina and have deep suspicions about
the negotiations.
   Argentina invaded the British colony, which it calls the
Malvinas, in April 1982 and Britain sent a naval force that expelled
the invaders in a 74-day war that cost nearly 1,000 lives. The
Argentines claim the islands under rights dating from Spanish
colonial days.
   Attempts to begin talks foundered on Britain's refusal to
negotiate the sovereignty of the islands. They are beginning now
because Carlos Menem, Argentina's new president, agreed to set the
sovereignty issue aside.
   Most islanders trust Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
determination not to negotiate the islands away, but some wonder
what will happen when she leaves office.
   Senior magistrate Rosie McIlroy is grateful for movement.
   ``I'm glad to see there are talks because it seems to me that the
stalemate that existed before could not benefit anyone,'' she said.
``I do think some form of link with South America for the Falkland
Islands is necessary.''
   Issues at stake include shipping, air and communications links
with Argentina, all severed since the war.
   Many islanders want no connections at all. They remember the
decade before the war, when the Argentine air force operated the
first regular air service to the islands and its ticket office in
Stanley was an intelligence outpost.
   When their troops landed, Argentine commanders had detailed
military and civilian knowledge of the islands.
   ``Britain and Argentina, OK,'' shop owner Peter Short said about
the talks, then added: ``Falklands and Argentina, no.''
   Brian Summers, commercial officer for Cable and Wireless, said of
Menem: ``This man is far too smart. He is going to say all the right
things to the right people.''
   By playing down the sovereignty issue, he suggested, Argentina
could gradually restore links of all kinds with the islands until
the transfer of sovereignty became inevitable.
   Joe Newell, a former farm manager, took the view that ``we're
going to have to deal with them sometime,'' and lawyer Kevin
Kilmartin said: ``It's quite obvious that Britain and Argentina
should talk to each other.''
   Kilmartin said he hoped Britain would allow the Falklands
government to make policy in those areas of particular concern to
the islanders.
   Among the thorniest issues is protection of fish stocks in the
South Atlantic, where Argentine and Falkland fishing zones abut.
   Islanders also want Argentina to stop influencing other South
American nations to deny access to a Falklands passenger and cargo
ship, which now may operate only to Punta Arenas, Chile.

<HEAD>Banks Complain That FDIC Name Being `Filched' by S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commercial bankers who successfully kept their
deposit insurance fund away from failed savings and loans are taking
their next cue from William Shakespeare.
   ``He who steals my purse, steals trash ... but he that filches
from me my good name ... makes me poor indeed,'' goes the line from
``Othello.''
   The bankers say the S&amp;Ls are engaged in a ``sneaky scheme'' to
appropriate the name of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC),
which once exclusively belonged to banks.
   But James H. Grohl, senior vice president of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, isn't worried about the complaints over its
letter saying thrift institutions can advertise they are insured by
the FDIC.
   ``Bankers are always outraged. It seems to be their eternal state
of being,'' Grohl said. ``Personally, I think they're making a
mountain out of a molehill here.''
   Legislation signed by President Bush on Aug. 9 reorganizes the
deposit insurance bureaucracy. Under the old system, the FDIC
guaranteed accounts in commercial banks while the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. (FSLIC) backed thrift deposits.
   Each type of institution displayed the initials of their
insurance fund in a logo on their door, reassuring each depositor
their money is insured to $100,000.
   The new law disbanded the FSLIC, which was out of money anyway,
and gave the FDIC jurisdiction over S&amp;L deposits. Now, the FDIC
manages two funds _ the Bank Insurance Fund, or BIF, and the Savings
Association Insurance Fund, or SAIF _ much as a household may have
two checking accounts.
   But bankers, despite their own troubles with failures during the
1980s in farm and oil-producing states, were proud of their logo and
didn't want to see it associated with S&amp;Ls.
   Congress agreed that banks could keep their FDIC logo. And, along
with billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, S&amp;Ls would get a new
logo with an American eagle and a message, ``Deposits federally
insured to $100,000. Backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States Government.''
   Banks thought they had won the battle, but now they're feeling
snookered by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   On the very day Bush signed the S&amp;L law, the league sent a letter
to its members saying that although they could not use the FDIC logo
they could advertise themselves as ``FDIC insured'' or ``insured by
the FDIC.''
   Bankers went ballistic. The Independent Bankers Association of
America headlined its weekly newsletter, ``Thrifts Try To Rustle
Banks' FDIC Brand.''
   ``We've fought this one before and won. What the league is doing
is a sneaky scheme to get what the Congress explicitly denied
them,'' said Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of the
American Bankers' Association.
   On Thursday, the ABA sent a letter to the FDIC urging the agency
not to ``devalue the 50 years of sterling reputation garnered by the
FDIC.'' Regulators, bankers argued, must forbid S&amp;Ls from referring
to any government agency as their insurer.
   But Grohl said such a ruling would raise a constitutional
question under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.
After all, how can the government prohibit a financial institution
from making a simple statement of fact?
   There is a serious issue behind the rhetoric. Savings and loans
lost billions of dollars in deposits earlier this year as bad news
mounted about their industry. Even rock-solid institutions had
problems calming their customers. Bankers don't want the public to
even slightly confuse their institutions with an S&amp;L.
   S&amp;Ls counter that ``full faith and credit of the United States
government'' means just what it says for both insurance funds.
Congress just proved that by spending taxpayers' money to protect
S&amp;L depositors, they say.
   Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for the FDIC, said the agency's
lawyers had made a preliminary determination it's legal for S&amp;Ls to
describe themselves as ``FDIC insured.'' The FDIC board will take
the bankers' objections under advisement, he said.

<HEAD>Veteran Counterfeiter Forges Pass From Custody</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A counterfeiter who has spent about 30 of the
past 50 years behind bars walked away from a court-ordered
supervised residency by forging a pass to a hospital, federal
officials said today.
   William ``Pops'' Kerns, 67, had been arrested in July on federal
counterfeiting charges and was sent to the pre-trial custody program
at the downtown Volunteers of America because of his age and poor
health, deputy U.S. Marshal Mark Robinett said.
   On Tuesday, Kerns apparently forged a pass to Wishard Hospital,
signing a counselor's name authorizing him to leave the residency.
   ``He left about six o'clock in the morning. That was the last
time he was seen,'' Robinett said.
   ``I think it would be safe to call him a career criminal,''
Robinett said. ``Mr. Kerns' first contact with law enforcement dates
back to 1939. He probably has at least 45 different arrests. And
that's that I know of.''
   Most of those offenses were for forgery, impersonating federal
officers, writing bad checks and counterfeiting.
   ``The longest time he's ever gone without being arrested is eight
years. But that's because he was in federal prison. Other than that,
he's never been out on the street more than four years at a time.
He's probably been in jail 30 years out of the last 50,'' Robinett
said.
   A nationwide alert has been issued.
   ``We've arrested him three times for counterfeiting,'' said
Raymond J. Yonkus, special agent in charge of the Secret Service
here. ``Hopefully, he'll be locked up soon.''
   Kerns was arrested in July after Secret Service agents allegedly
caught him making counterfeit $100 bills on a printing press in New
Castle. Despite his age and poor health, prosecutors had asked U.S.
Magistrate J. Patrick Endsley to order Kerns to remain in jail
pending trial. Endsley disagreed and sent Kerns to the less secure
Volunteers of America facility.

<HEAD>Baltics Look West to Warsaw in Independence Drive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Residents of the Soviet Baltic republics
are encouraged by neighboring Poland's bold steps away from
communism as they probe the limits of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms.
   As more than a million Baltic residents formed a human chain this
week to mourn the independence they lost to Stalin's tanks a
half-century ago, a poster was displayed in Vilnius, the Lithuanian
capital:
   ``Lithuanians and Poles: Let's Unite Against the Common Enemy.''
   It was not clear whether the message was directed at Poles living
in their homeland or the Polish minority in Lithuania, but there was
little doubt about the ``common enemy'': Soviet-style communism.
   The message tried to cuts across the border formed by Stalin's
incorporation of the Baltics in 1940 to emphasize Lithuania's
location twice as far Moscow as from Warsaw, and five centuries of
history when the two lands were united in one kingdom.
   Poland's Solidarity trade union capped its nine-year reform
battle with the election Thursday of one its leaders as prime
minister, the first non-Communist in that post in the East bloc. On
the previous day in the Baltics, residents held hands to mark the
50th anniversary of a secret Nazi-Soviet agreement that gave Poland
to Germany and the Baltics to the Soviet Union on the eve of World
War II.
   Although Baltic activists stress there are many differences
between their campaign and that of Solidarity, they say the group's
experience is valuable.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, president of the Lithuanian grassroots
independence movement Sajudis, said in an interview that
Solidarity's accomplishments were important ``for all democratic
forces in Eastern Europe, like the movement in 1968 in
Czechoslovakia.''
   So far, the Kremlin's reaction to the formation of a
non-communist government in Poland has been calm, taking the line
that it is the country's internal affair and offering to work with
the new prime minister. The response to the Baltic movement has been
harsh words against calls for independence but overall an
unprecedented level of tolerance and even sympathy to their demands
for at least economic autonomy.
   Some Baltic residents, especially the elderly who saw troops roll
in 1940 to impose Soviet rule, fear the Kremlin will again send in
tanks and troops, as it did in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia 12
years later, to crush the Baltic democratic movement.
   But others point to Solidarity's victory as proof that force will
not work.
   Peter Sookruus, deputy propaganda chief of Estonia's Communist
Party Central Committee, said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's imposition
of martial law in Poland in December 1981 backfired.
   ``Poland finally faced bigger problems than it had originally. In
that sense, Poland served as an example,'' Sookruss told a news
conference in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. ``The Polish
Communist Party was willing to give up its monopoly on power.''
   Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity official who in a sign of the
group's improved standing has become a Polish senator, traveled to
Vilnius and the Latvian capital Riga to join in last week's
ceremonies. In an interview in the Sajudis offices, he agreed the
Kremlin would be unlikely to repeat the mistake and forcibly put
down the Baltic independence drive.
   ``We couldn't be destroyed even if we were in prison. The
symbols, ethos (of Solidarity) are very important in the socialist
bloc. This was all preserved despite the imposition of martial law
in December 1981,'' said Romaszewski, sporting a red Solidarity pin
on his lapel.
   Solidarity proved that ``it is possible to organize an
anti-totalitarian movement,'' he said.
   The senator said Gorbachev's reform effort and worsening economic
conditions in Poland and the Soviet Union are forcing Communist
leaders to realize they must put up with opposition groups and
democracy, and that the Kremlin must allow Poland and the Baltics to
settle their problems without interference.
   While they reject Kremlin meddling, activists on both sides
welcome cooperation between the democratic movements.
   Algis Cekuolis, a member of Sajudis ruling council, said
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has promised to travel to Lithuania
this fall to try to help Sajudis persuade the republic's Polish
minority to join the group in fighting for independence.
   Poles, representing about 8 percent of Lithuania's population,
are more aligned with Russians than Lithuanians and have formed a
political group, Unity, to fight for their own rights. So far, the
Poles are concerned about Sajudis' Lithuanian nationalism.
   But while they see a future of cooperation, many Lithuanians say
they and the Poles are too different to copy each other's tactics.
   ``Everybody has their own way,'' said Raimonda Kaminskiene, an
English teacher interviewed at a pro-independence rally in Vilnius.
``We are not so quick in our character. We are more northern, more
Scandinavian. We always have to think what we are doing.''
   She then quoted a Lithuanian saying about sewing, similar to one
in Russian, to underscore the point. ``You have to think nine times,
and the 10th you have to cut.''

<TEXT>
   Muffled drumbeats should be the loudest sound
Saturday when the NAACP recreates in the capital the ``Silent
March,'' a civil rights protest in New York City 72 years ago.
   The protest will focus on ``the Supreme Court and its recent
hostile decisions'' diluting affirmative action and minority
set-aside programs, said NAACP executive director Benjamin L. Hooks.
   The 1917 demonstration, in which 8,000 people led by W.E.B.
DuBois paraded in silence down Fifth Avenue, protested segregation
laws and lynchings in the South.
   The Washington march, also led by six drummers playing on muffled
instruments, is designed to duplicate the New York march in tone and
style if not in crowd size.
   The march will end at the Capitol with a rally, including
speeches by Hooks, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Joseph
Lowery, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Hooks and other officials of the NAACP _ National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People _ gave no crowd projection other
than ``several thousand.''
   ``We are not looking toward bringing vast numbers of people to
Washington,'' he said. ``In this instance, the medium is the message
and the medium is the silent march.''

   Four years ago, Mayumi Moriyama was excluded from a
diplomats' golf tournament she was holding because the Koganei
Country Club, bastion of Japan's power circles, didn't admit women.
   The fact that she was vice minister of foreign affairs at the
time made no difference. Neither would her appointment on Friday to
the highest government post ever attained by a woman, chief Cabinet
secretary.
   Although the country club still is closed to women in this
male-dominated society, the scandals that have plagued the governing
party have created some unprecedented openings for women.
   Sex and bribery scandals and an unpopular sales have resulted in
the resignations of three prime ministers in three months,
critically weakening the conservative Liberal Democratic Party that
has controlled government for decades.
   With her new duties, Mrs. Moriyama, 61, will act as a highly
visible spokewoman for new Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
coordinate the turf battles among Japan's fiercely competitive
ministries.
   She will also act as one of the Liberal Democratic Party's chief
public relations weapons against Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman
Takako Doi, who also has skyrocketed in popularity amid the scandals
involving male politicians.
   Kaifu tried to link Mrs. Moriyama with the popular ``ordinary
housewife'' image that helped propel many female opposition
candidates into office in last month's election.
   ``Mrs. Moriyama has an experience as a housewife as well as that
of a bureaucrat,'' Kaifu said after appointing her. ``I would like
her to push forward political reforms from the standpoint of the
people.''
   Ms. Doi, the charismatic socialist leader, led a slate of
candidates packed with women to a major defeat of the ruling Liberal
Democrats in elections for the upper house of Parliament last month.
   Mrs. Moriyama replaces Tokuo Yamashita, 69, who resigned after
apologizing for a much-publicized extramarital affair with a bar
hostess 43 years his junior.
   Kaifu himself replaced Prime Minister Sousuki Uno, who resigned
because of his reported affairs with women.
   Although seen as a competent and highly intelligent politician,
Mrs. Moriyama is considered inexperienced. She also is hampered by
being a member of the less-powerful upper house, with only two
terms' experience and only a small power base in the party.
   She assumed her first Cabinet post just two weeks ago, when she
was appointed head of the Environment Agency.
   ``The appointment is apparently aimed at bettering the image of
the government,'' said Soichiro Tawara, a prominent political
critic. ``But I can't help thinking the choice was made perhaps a
little too hastily and lightly. She may be helpful in some ways, but
I am not confident that a politician with such limited experience
can handle perhaps the most demanding position in the Cabinet.''
   But if she lacks clout, Mrs. Moriyama enjoys general respect, and
her education and civil service experience matches that of her male
colleagues.
   ``As far as my near 40-year professional experience is concerned,
I never felt any handicaps for being a woman,'' she said after her
appointment.
   Moriyama was one of just two women in a class of 686 that
graduated in 1950 from the Law Department of prestigious Tokyo
University, the breeding ground for Japanese politicians. She
entered the Labor Ministry as one of its first female career
officers in 1950, and was director general of its Women's and Young
Workers' Bureau from 1974-80.
   In 1980, she was elected to the House of Councillors from Tochigi
prefecture, and in 1985 was appointed parliamentary vice minister
for foreign affairs, when her exclusion from the golf club became a
minor cause celebre. Mrs. Moriyama, whose official handicap is 26,
was never admitted to the club.
   Mrs. Moriyama commands greater international skills than many
Japanese politicians. She is fluent in English and served as head of
the Japanese delegation to the U.N. World Conference on the Women's
Decade in Nairobi in 1985.
   She has experience dealing in Japan-U.S. relations and other
international problems as chairman of the party's Foreign Affairs
Devision and as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the
upper house.
   Mrs. Moriyama is the widow of Kinji Moriyama, a legislator and
former transportation minister who died of a heart attack in 1987,
and is said to have inherited some of his power base. She has two
daughters.

<BYLINE>Lawyer in Hastings Case Goes to Jail for Contempt ^By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disbarred lawyer William Borders was jailed
Friday for refusing to answer a senator's questions in the
impeachment case against federal judge Alcee Hastings.
   The once-prominent Washington defense lawyer will serve his time
at the Federal Correctional Institution at Petersburg, Va.,
according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Washington.
   Borders surrendered quietly, going through a back entrance to the
U.S. courthouse without speaking to reporters.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered Borders
incarcerated Tuesday after holding the lawyer in civil contempt of
court at the Senate's request.
   Borders can free himself by answering a Senate impeachment
committee's questions, or he can wait for release until the Senate
votes on impeaching Hastings, probably not before mid-October.
   Borders refused to answer 10 questions from Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., about impeachment charges against Hastings, a 52-year-old
U.S. district judge from Florida.
   Granted immunity from prosecution for what he might tell the
committee, Borders was ordered by the court to testify but refused.
He argued that the questions violated his constitutional rights,
including the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Hastings is accused of plotting with Borders in 1981 to obtain a
$150,000 payoff and of lying about it to a jury that acquitted him
in 1981. Borders was convicted in a separate trial, disbarred and
served 33 months in prison.
   Despite the acquittal, the House in August 1988 approved 17
articles of impeachment against Hastings, charging him with the
payoff conspiracy, perjury and improper disclosure of information
obtained from a court-approved wiretap.
   The committee will produce a report on the evidence against
Hastings, and the Senate then will vote on whether to remove him
from the bench.
   The questions posed by Specter on Tuesday ranged from whether
Hastings received any payoff money to the alleged relationship
between Borders and the late Florida organized crime boss Santo
Trafficante.
   Borders replied to each question by citing a statement he made
July 27 when he also refused to testify before the committee. The
statement said the questions violated his rights.
   Borders also objected on the grounds that since Specter was the
only senator on hand for the session, a quorum of the committee was
not present.
   Specter, however, reminded him of a resolution providing that one
senator constitutes a quorum for purposes of hearing testimony from
Borders.

<TEXT>
   Three teen-agers have been charged with
defacing the American flag, raising constitutional questions in
light of the recent Supreme Court ruling on flag-burning, an
American Civil Liberties Union official said.
   The charge stems from a vandalism spree Wednesday at Byrnes High
School in which two flags were burned, paint was sloshed on floors,
books were scattered and fire extinguishers sprayed.
   Three 13-year-old boys, students at another school, were charged
Thursday in Family Court with defacing the flag, entering without
breaking, grand larceny and arson.
   It has been illegal in South Carolina since 1916 to ``publicly
mutilate, deface, defile, defy, jeer at, trample upon or cast
contempt, either by word or act,'' the American flag. Similar
statutes protect the state and Confederate flags.
   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an individual's right to
burn the flag as a form of political expression under the U.S.
Constitution.
   Police Chief Chuck Shelton said Thursday he was aware of the
Supreme Court decision but said he believed he had to follow South
Carolina law as long as it remained on the books.
   ``If they won't prosecute it, they don't have to,'' he said.
   Steven Bates, executive director of the South Carolina ACLU, said
the state flag-desecration law should now be considered
unconstitutional.
   The suspects ``ought to be prosecuted under property crime law,''
Bates said. ``They weren't desecrating the flag, they were
destroying other people's property.''
   He said the ACLU is considering whether to argue that the charge
in this case is inappropriate under the state desecration statute.
   Solicitor Holman C. Gossett Jr. said he would have to examine the
case further before deciding whether to prosecute.

   A British communications satellite is
to be launched Sunday on the first commercial American space rocket,
the rocket's manufacturer said Friday.
   The satellite, Marcopolo 1, is to be sent into space at 6:50 p.m.
by a three-stage Delta booster, McDonnell Douglas officials said.
   Orbiting 22,300 miles up, Marcopolo 1 is the first of two
satellites designed to transmit pay-TV programs direct to British
homes equipped with a 12-inch-diameter antenna.
   The launch will mark a milestone in a commercial space program
started when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was
told by then-President Reagan to stop launching commercial payloads
after the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. Reagan said the
job should be done by private industry.
   Three U.S. companies took up the goal in earnest; the McDonnell
Douglas Delta is the first to the launch pad. Martin Marietta has
scheduled a commercial launch with its Titan rocket later this year,
and General Dynamics' Atlas is to make its debut next year.
   All three rockets are upgraded versions of boosters that NASA and
the Air Force have used for several years.
   British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. selected Hughes Aircraft Co.
in 1987 to build the two Marcopolo satellites under a $300 million
contract.
   McDonnell Douglas is charging Hughes $50 million for each of the
two launches. Hughes must verify that the satellites are in orbit
and working before BSB accepts them.

   Bad weather forced the suspension
today of a search for a Pakistan International Airlines plane with
54 people aboard that disappeared over the Himalaya and Korakoram
mountains.
   Two Pakistan Air Force C-130 aircraft, helicopters and a small
PIA plane scanned the mountains for signs of the twin-engine
Fokker-27 until the onset of darkness and rains forced them to wait
until Saturday, said Azra Sultan, an airline spokeswoman.
   The airline said the twin-engine plane had not been heard from
since it took off early this morning on what should have been a
45-minute flight from Gilgit to Islamabad.
   Ms. Sultan said most of the 49 passengers aboard were Pakistanis,
but the list included an American, Paul McGorrian, a freelance
journalist believed to be from St. Petersburg, Fla. There were five
crew members.
   Rescue workers in planes searched the mountains today, but their
effort was hampered by thunderstorms and heavy rains.
   It was not known if the missing plane had encountered bad
weather, but planes generally don't leave the Korakoram Mountain
city of Gilgit in storms.
   A chief pilot at Pakistan International Airlines, who identified
himself only as Khizar, said the search was conducted by the
Pakistan Air Force, the Civil Aviation Authority, their Indian
counterparts, and the U.N. Military Observer Group in India and
Pakistan posted in the disputed state of Jammu-Kashmir.

<TEXT>
   Twelve railroad workers have sued Amtrak,
alleging that passenger trains have dumped raw sewage on them while
they repaired a bridge.
   The workers claim in the lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court this
week, that they have been sprayed repeatedly by raw sewage since
1987 while working on a Portland-area railroad bridge over the
Willamette River.
   They say they have suffered flulike symptoms from exposure to
human waste and have ``extreme concern'' about working at that site.
The lawsuit alleges that Amtrak has continued the practice despite
workers' complaints.
   Amtrak officials have no comment on the lawsuit, said Clifford
Black, manager of public affairs for the National Railroad Passenger
Corp. in Washington, D.C., which runs Amtrak.
   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of problems Amtrak has had
in Oregon over its practice of dumping sewage from passenger trains
onto railroad tracks.
   The state Department of Environmental Quality recently fined the
train service $2,700 and demanded compliance with an Oregon law that
prohibits such dumping.
   Black said Amtrak would contest the penalty. Amtrak officials
have said in the past that under federal law, which they say
supersedes state law, they are not prohibited from dumping waste
onto tracks.
   Florida apparently is the only other state that has challenged
Amtrak on the dumping, said Sherman Olson of the environmental
agency.

<HEAD>Taiwan, U.S. Agree To Fishing Pact In North Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan and the United States today signed an
agreement to regulate Taiwanese fishing in the North Pacific by
placing transmitters aboard ships, State Department officials said.
   The pact, a copy of which was made available to The Associated
Press, is aimed at high-seas salmon poaching by Taiwanese driftnet
vessels.
   The agreement calls for transmitters that will fix the location
of Taiwanese fishing vessels to be placed on board by 1990 and
allows enforcement officers to board the vessels.
   The United States has accused Taiwan fishermen of using driftnets
to deplete the North Pacific of its rich marine resources,
especially the anadromous species of salmon that spawn in the United
States.
   Both Taiwan and the United States ban salmon fishing in the
region.
   Conservationists have criticized the miles-long driftnets for
their ``incidental'' catches of thousands of sea birds, seals and
other animals.
   ``We hope this will reduce salmon poaching,'' Doug Ellice,
executive officer of the American Institute in Taiwan, said from his
Washington, D.C., office.
   ``Taiwan's are not the only boats out there. We hope this would
be a model for the Koreans and others,'' Ellice said.
   The United States earlier reached a driftnet agreement with
Japan, but is still attempting to reach an agreement with South
Korea.
   ``Tough negotiating pays off,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska. ``I believe signing this agreement lays the cornerstone
for an overall effort to secure our fisheries and protect a most
vital resource.''
   The tentative agreement was signed Thursday by David Laux,
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, and Ding Mou-shih,
Taiwan's representative in Washington. Diplomatic letters to
finalize the agreement were signed today.
   Enforcement of the agreement will fall to the institute, which is
the unofficial U.S. embassy in Taipei. The institute's enforcement
will use U.S. government employees under contract to the institute,
Ellice said.
   Yu Yu-hsien, chairman of Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, said
the agreement was not an ideal pact for local fishermen but it was
acceptable for Taiwan.

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara,
called off a boating excursion Friday after he ran his 28-foot power
craft over a submerged object and damaged the housing of one of the
vessel's two propellers.
   Bush was returning with his boat, Fidelity, after a fishing trip
with two reporters when it hit either a board or a lobster pot. The
boat was taken to a nearby marina for repairs.
   The bad luck with his boat follows even worse luck with rod and
reel. Bush has yet to catch a fish despite going out daily since he
arrived at his summer home more than a week ago.
   Bush on Thursday blamed his bad luck on the commotion in the
water caused by the fleet of seven or eight boats, many of them
chartered by news organizations, that follow him.
   Friday's fishing trip was to be the first under an informal
agreeement under which the chase boats were to keep farther away, at
least while Bush was fishing.
   ``I'll try any technique that works,'' Bush said Friday.

   A history buff who calls herself one of
``those slightly wacky kind of people'' placed an advertisement in
the newspaper this week to commemorate the death of King Richard III
of England _ who died more than 500 years ago.
   Yvonne Mason paid for a memorial to King Richard that was run
Tuesday on the obituary page of The News, complete with his emblem,
the white boar, and his motto ``Loyaulte Me Lie,'' which translates,
``Loyalty binds me.''
   King Richard, who was the object of a play by Shakespeare, was
accused of having his two young nephews murdered so he could claim
the throne. Ms. Mason, a member of the Richard III Society, believes
history dealt unfairly with him.
   ``I think most of us, the people who are involved in this, are
kind of those slightly wacky kind of people who just seriously
believe in something and want it to be different,'' Ms. Mason said.
   After reading Shakespeare's play, she started reading books about
the king. ``I thought, `You know, something is not right here. This
man doesn't seem quite as bad as he's painted,''' she said. She said
Friday that she believs the order to have the boys killed came from
someone else.
   The Richard III Society claims 5,000 members including about 800
in the United States.
   She has run her memorial for three or four years in The News.
Other society members do the same in London and in other towns.
   ``I think in the context of history, it's really time that he's
recognized for the able and just and intelligent leader that he was,
instead of, `Isn't he the one who killed those children in that
tower?''' she said.

   Sam Gregory is bringing a touch of
Merrie Olde England to his Southern California neighborhood.
   Remembering a time of courageous knights and horse-drawn
carriages, Gregory is building a castle complete with cast-iron
gates, a spiraling staircase, a moat and a drawbridge.
   Once finished, the 3,000-square-foot structure around Gregory's
existing home will contain a living room, master bedroom, study,
kitchen, dining room and bathrooms, said Gregory, who has been a
general contractor for 25 years.
   Already, the masonry and the skeleton of the structure has been
completed. And there are two ducks, gifts to Gregory's wife, Rose,
swimming in the moat.
   Before the last concrete block is placed, Gregory said he expects
to spend $300,000 _ a little more than planned.
   But cost is no object, he said, explaining he intends to keep the
promise he made to his wife several years ago.
   ``This is dedicated to the one I love,'' he sang off-key.

   Prince Albert of Monaco and two fellow members of
the International Olympic Committee are touring Atlanta to determine
whether it should be host of the 1996 Olympic Games.
   Beginning the four-day tour by limousine Thursday, the prince
questioned Mayor Andrew Young about the city's recent FBI ranking as
No. 1 in the nation for violent crime.
   ``I hate to bring up a negative point, Mr. Young, but is there a
crime problem?'' the prince asked.
   ``We catch criminals and we put them in jail,'' Young replied.
``That makes our statistics high because we make so many arrests.''
   Prince Albert, citing Atlanta's economy, said the city ``could
certainly support a successful Olympics.''
   ``Atlanta seems to have a very solid bid,'' he said.
   The prince, Gunther Heinze of East Germany and Vladimir Cernusak
of Czechoslovakia also met with Gov. Joe Frank Harris, who said the
Democratic National Convention held in Atlanta last summer ``came
off without a hitch.''
   Also in the running for the 1996 games is Athens, Greece, home of
the ancient Olympics, but Prince Albert expressed concern about the
country's political and economic problems.
   ``Athens' sentimental popularity is going to weigh pretty
heavily, but it's not going to be the only thing that we look at,''
he said.

   Actor William Hurt used religious doctrine to
induce his former lover, Sandra Jennings, to live with him in
common-law marriage, Jennings' lawyer reportedly charged in a legal
brief filed this week.
   Lawyer Richard Golub said Hurt used the phrases ``spiritual
marriage'' and ``marriage in God's eyes,'' New York Newsday reported
Friday.
   Jennings, 32, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, is
suing to have her relationship with Hurt, 39, declared a marriage
based on four weeks they lived together while he filmed ``The Big
Chill'' in South Carolina.
   ``There is no doubt that the defendant used the techniques of
religious doctrine and argument to induce (Jennings) to marry him,
common-law fashion,'' Newsday quoted Golub as charging in an 89-page
brief filed Wednesday. The newspaper said it reviewed that brief and
Hurt's lawyers' 54-page reply, though both documents were
confidential because the case is matrimonial.
   The Academy Award-winning actor's lawyers called Jennings'
testimony a fabrication.
   Hurt and Jennings began living together in 1981 but the case is
based on the time between the day Hurt learned of his divorce, Dec.
9, 1982, and the day the couple left South Carolina, Jan. 19, 1983.
   New York does not sanction common-law marriage but recognizes the
legality of such relationships in other states.
   The case, resided by State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline
Silbermann, is expected to be decided within 30 days.
   Hurt has made voluntary payments to Jennings of about $65,000.
They have a 6-year-old son, Alexander Devon Hurt.

<HEAD>Hopkins Researchers Say Second Drug May Help Cut Cost of AZT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The anti-AIDS drug AZT apparently stays in the
body longer when combined with a drug commonly used to treat gout,
allowing patients to use less of it, researchers said Friday.
   If further tests continue to show the combination of AZT and the
drug probenecid is safe and effective, AIDS patients may be able to
significantly reduce AZT dosages, said Dr. David M. Kornhauser,
assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins' Division of
Clinical Phamacology.
   Kornhauser said the combination therapy could lead to a major
reduction in the skyrocketing cost of AIDS treatment.
   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease reported
last week that AZT delays the progession of AIDS in some
HIV-infected people who have not developed AIDS symptoms, a group
estimated at up to 630,000 nationwide.
   At the current cost of up to $8,000 annually per patient for AZT,
also known as azidothymidine, treating this group with the drug
could reach more than $5 billion yearly. Kornhauser said that cost
could be cut in half with the combination therapy.
   The Hopkins study, conducted during the first six months of 1988,
was published in Friday's edition of the British medical journal
Lancet.
   ``At this time, we're not saying that everyone should go out and
use probenecid,'' Kornhauser said. ``This is an important first
step, but we must continue with careful study before this therapy is
widely adopted.
   ``I think we should proceed to see if the combination works as
well as AZT alone because it would make it a therapy less expensive
for patients and less expensive for the country,'' Kornhauser added.
   Probenecid apparently works by slowing the combination of
flucuronic acid, a sugar derivative, with AZT.
   Hopkins researchers gave the AZT-probenecid combination to eight
men with either AIDS or AIDS-related complex for three days and then
measured AZT concentrations in the blood. They found that levels of
AZT were nearly doubled by adding probenecid so that patients might
be able to take the drug once every eight hours instead of the usual
four hours.
   A second, month-long trial of eight to 10 people less ill than
those in the initial study is expected to begin within the next two
weeks.
   ``We'll be studying this group to see how well they tolerate the
combination over a longer period of time, while looking for signs of
toxicity, which we don't anticipate,'' Kornhauser said.
   He said the next step would be a trial involving at least 1,000
AIDS patients to compare the use of AZT alone with the combination
treatment.

   Voyager 2 plunged over Neptune's north
pole and today took its closest look at the moon Triton, discovering
dormant ice-spewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs, faults
and glacier-like lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic
exploration of four planets.
   ``This is it _ we are exploring new worlds!'' laboratory
astronomer Rich Terrile said after the 12-year-old spaceship made
its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet. Neptune ``is not
a gee-whiz, science-fiction, special effects movie. It's a real
place.''
   The one-ton Voyager probe skimmed 3,048 miles above Neptune's icy
north pole cloud tops at 8:56 p.m. PDT Thursday _ the closest of its
planetary encounters _ after being accelerated by Neptune's gravity
to a speed of 61,148 mph.
   Its photos of Triton revealed that Neptune's major moon has
large, inactive volcanic craters, called calderas, ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock,'' said
Voyager project scientist Ed Stone.
   ``It's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' although
volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a
moon of Uranus, Stone said. ``This is a real volcano.''
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said today in a speech to
hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Reiterating President Bush's July statement in support of an
eventual permanent base on the Earth's moon and a manned trip to
Mars, Quayle declared: ``We Americans have been opening new
frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so.
Today, space is America's frontier.''
   Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, called the climax of the
Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time we're seeing a
planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the
planets, except Pluto.''
   Five hours after the rendezvous with Neptune, the spaceship made
its closest pass by the moon Triton at 2:10 a.m., a flyby that was
confirmed when signals reached Earth at 6:16 a.m. PDT.
   The four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes Voyager's
radio signal to travel the 2.75 billion miles to Earth.
   The array of information on Neptune's largest moon had
scientists, if anything, more excited than they were about Neptune
itself.
   ``Triton will upstage Neptune. It's filled with hummocky,
rippling terrain,'' Terrile said.
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' said Laurence Soderblom, of the U.S. Geological Survey. The
faults suggest that ``Triton quakes'' may have occurred at one time
on the moon.
   Later, Joseph Boyce, a NASA geologist, said there was ``abundant
evidence of ice volcanism'' in the latest pictures. He referred to
volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other ice-like
substance rather than molten rock.
   Voyager's newest photos of Triton received this morning showed a
smooth feature, looking somewhat like a dry lakebed, that Boyce said
measured several hundred miles across.
   ``It looked like it could be a ... crater of a volcano itself,''
Boyce said. ``It looks like some sort of feature flooded by
material, and the material is probably volcanic material.''
   The Voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows
on Uranus' moon Ariel in 1986, and earlier found active
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io, a moon of Jupiter.
   Boyce emphasized there is no evidence yet that Triton's icy
volcanism is currently active, but said the smooth floor of the
crater, unmarked by meteorite impact craters, indicates that the ice
volcano may have been active within the last million years or so.
   Earlier, Bradford Smith, head of Voyager's photographic imaging
team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had described Triton's
surface in photos taken Thursday as ``extremely strange and
puzzling.''
   The photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and
``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' scientist
Torrence Johnson said.
   While difficult to interpret, the early photos of Triton gave
``the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and
alien surface,'' with what appears to be a blue, pink and white
topography that is ``closer to flat than big mountains,'' said
Smith, who called the pictures ``Just short of spectacular.''
   At 11:59 p.m. PDT, signals were received showing that Voyager had
been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it
passed through the plane containing Neptune's rings, said Donald
Gurnett. The particles, each about a millionth of a yard across _
the size of the particles in cigarette smoke _ did not damage the
spacecraft, Gurnett said.
   Voyager's safe progress through the ring plane prompted
scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the
spaceship's near encounter with Neptune, Smith said.
   ``There's certainly euphoria,'' he said. ``We are all very
excited.''
   Scientists announced Thursday that Voyager discovered two more
tiny moons orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet: a
60-mile-wide moon designated 1989 N5, and the even smaller 1989 N6,
which is a mere 30 miles wide.
   That brought the number of Neptune's moons discovered before the
close encounter to eight, including the two moons detected from
Earth _ Triton and Nereid _ and four found earlier by Voyager.
   Voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling Neptune,
although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc.
Voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from
Neptune almost certainly also is a complete ring.
   During its flight past Neptune and Triton, Voyager was programmed
to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study
their atmospheres; measure changes in distant starlight to study the
rings and search for others; and take its best but still
2.9-million-mile-distant pictures of Nereid.
   Voyager's hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of
Neptune's atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400-mph winds,
high-altitude clouds, and its Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and other
cyclones.
   NASA calculated Voyager's position during the Neptune flyby as
nearly 2.75 billion miles from Earth. But the ship had traveled a
curving path totaling 4.43 billion miles since it was launched in
1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   Champagne flowed at the laboratory Thursday when Voyager crossed
the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets Neptune's
magnetic field.
   Earlier pictures of Triton suggested the backward-orbiting moon
had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural
gas on its pink-and-blue surface.
   Using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry
to aim a space probe built with 1960s technology, NASA engineers
said Thursday they got Voyager to within 20 miles of where it was
supposed to be after the long journey.
   ``Not bad shooting,'' said one engineer.
   Voyager 1 visited Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, and now is
speeding toward interstellar space _ just as Voyager 2 will do after
it stops studying Neptune on Oct. 2.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but Pluto's
elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making Neptune temporarily
the solar system's outmost planet.
   ``Someday there ought to be a Pluto flyby,'' Fisk said. ``But
there are no active plans to do that.''

   A judge Friday imposed 15 years of probation
on a cocaine-addicted mother convicted of delivering drugs to two of
her children at birth.
   Jennifer Johnson, 23, faced a 30-year prison sentence on the
conviction under a law usually applied to criminals engaged in
illegal drug transactions.
   ``I don't have any desire to hurt you. ... I'm not here to put
you in prison,'' Circuit Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. told Ms. Johnson
before handing down the sentence, which includes at least one year
in a residential drug-treatment program she is now attending.
   Ms. Johnson is believed to be the first mother in Florida _ and
one of only a few in the country _ convicted of providing drugs to
their newborns under a criminal drug-dealing law.
   In a non-jury trial last month, Eaton determined that Ms. Johnson
had delivered cocaine to her babies through their umbilical cords.
He acquitted her of a child-abuse count.
   The children _ a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in January _
are cared for by relatives and are described as in in good health.
But scientists have said that cocaine can cause neurological
problems, premature birth and even death in newborns.
   Justifying the conviction under the statute which prohibits
``delivery'' of an illegal substance from one person to another, the
judge ruled that ``a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has
not (yet) been severed is a person'' within Florida law.
   Other terms of the lengthy probation period included one year of
strict supervision by probation officers during the rehabilitation
program, random drug testing at least once a month for a year,
educational and vocational training, an intense prenatal program if
she should become pregnant again and 200 hours of community service.
   Ms. Johnson, a slim, bespectacled woman with a ready smile,
declined the judge's invitation to speak about her problem. But in
response to the judge's question as to whether she believed she was
getting some benefit from the drug-treatment program, she said,
``Yes sir, I just feel a lot of pressure.''
   Prosecutor Jeff Deen, who said the case would set a precedent in
Florida, had recommended strict compliance with the drug-treatment
program and lengthy probation. He had called it ``a child-abuse
case, not a drug case.''
   ``We want to send a message not of fear, but of hope'' to
drug-addicted mothers to take care of their problems, Deen told the
judge.
   ``She's used up all her chances,'' the prosecutor said. ``We need
to ensure that this woman does not give birth to another cocaine
baby. ... The message is that this community cannot afford to have
two or three cocaine babies from the same person. ''
   Defense attorney James Sweeting, who is appealing the conviction,
maintained again that his client should not have been tried under
the drug-delivery statute. He said the Florida Legislature intended
the law for drug traffickers, not mothers and children.
   ``Giving birth to a child, we do not think this is a 30-year
felony. ... This is not a criminal issue,'' Sweeting said after the
sentencing. ``The Legislature has been usurped, overridden by this
court and this prosecution.''
   In explaining his verdict issued last month, the judge said he
considered the two children to be the victims because they ``had no
ability to control what was being introduced into their bodies.''
   Ms. Johnson was acquitted by the judge of one count of child
abuse. But other mothers giving birth to cocaine babies have been
successfully prosecuted under that law, which carries a maximum of
five years in prison.

<HEAD>States Say FEC Computer Election Standards Costly, Time-Consuming</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State election officials said Friday they face
financial and other obstacles in trying to implement voluntary
federal guidelines for computerized voting systems.
   The Federal Election Commission standards, intended to guide
state authorities who oversee elections, are aimed at assuring that
the computerized systems used in many states are accurate and
fraud-free. But a draft proposal has come under criticism from some
public interest groups.
   The state election officials voiced their concerns at a meeting
of the 20-member advisory panel of the FEC's National Clearinghouse
on Election Administration.
   Ronald Michaelson, executive director of the Illinois State Board
of Elections, said he expects that implementing the FEC standards
will require ``very arduous'' efforts.
   ``I anticipate it's going to be a very difficult task in
Illinois, and a time-consuming one,'' he said.
   Dot Joyce, a Florida election official, said her state's
legislature last January passed legislation largely modeled after
the FEC standards, which have been in the drafting stage for several
years, but provided no money for carrying it out.
   Since then, she said, ``We've just been really scratching our
heads, picking people's brains. ... We've been operating with no
funds to put our standards in place.''
   Deborah Seiler, California's chief of elections and political
reform, said election authorities in her state also lack enough
money to implement the computerized voting system standards.
   ``We will need funds ... to help us adopt that part of the
standards which involves the certification process'' for computer
equipment and software, she said.
   Penelope Bonsall, director of the FEC clearinghouse, told the
meeting the commission aims to make a final decision on the
standards by late October. She said that a 30-day period for
submitting public comments on the standards will run through Sept. 8.
   Public interest groups criticizing the draft standards include
Election Watch, a project of the Urban Policy Research Institute,
based in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
   ``The first major inadequacy is that they're not mandatory,''
said Mae Churchill, director of Election Watch. ``The second is that
there ... was virtually no sign of any public input into their
creation.''
   There has been increased concern in recent years over the
accuracy and security of computerized tabulation systems, which in
1988 were used in handling more than 50 percent of all voters'
ballots nationwide.
   ``The election community is underfunded and underorganized,''
according to Lance J. Hoffman, a computer science professor at
George Washington University. ``With some exceptions, it knows
little about managing computer security. Few jurisdictions share
knowledge. Therefore, American elections are more vulnerable to
fraud and error than is desirable or necessary.''
   The proposed FEC standards outline in technical language the
steps that should be followed by election authorities to operate a
reliable voting system. The latest draft was released Aug. 8.
   The standards are to be voluntary because by law, states control
their own election systems. Computerized voting systems include
those using punchcards; marksense cards, in which a person marks his
choice in pencil on cards that are read by computer; and
direct-recording electronic systems, in which the voter pushes a
button.

   Kim Dae-jung, South Korea's best-known
dissident, said Friday his indictment under the national security
laws was an act of persecution intended to discredit his opposition
political party.
   Radical students shouting slogans against the government and the
United States battled riot police with rocks and firebombs in the
worst campus violence for several months. The protests were not
inspired by the action against Kim, but were directed at the laws
under which he was charged.
   Kim leads the Party for Peace and Democracy, the largest
opposition group in South Korea. He said the charges were fabricated
and declared to followers: ``I have nothing to fear. I will squarely
face trial.''
   Prosecutors charged in the indictments, presented earlier Friday,
that Kim and two legislators from his party failed to report
National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won's secret trip to Communist North
Korea last year. The three opposition figures were not jailed
pending trial.
   National security laws forbid unauthorized travel to North Korea,
which South Korea has defined as an enemy country since the
peninsula was divided in 1945. The two Koreas fought a war in
1950-53, but no peace treaty has been signed.
   If convicted, Kim, party floor leader Kim Won-ki and Rep. Lee
Chul-yong could be sentenced to prison terms of up to five years.
   Kim said prosecutors knew they could not win the case, so the
three might never be tried. Aides said the government could
influence the judiciary to delay proceedings indefinitely.
   Legal experts said the trial of Suh, the man who made the trip,
should be finished within six months. It is to begin in September.
   Suh was arrested June 28 on charges of espionage, violating a ban
on unauthorized travel to North Korea and receiving $120,000 from
North Korean agents before and during the trip to Pyongyang in
August 1988.
   Prosecutors said they had evidence that Kim knew about Suh's trip
two months before it was made public in June. Kim has said he did
not learn of the trip until shortly before Suh turned himself in to
authorities in late June.
   The 64-year-old opposition leader also was charged with violating
the Foreign Currency Control Law by receiving $10,000 from Suh.
Prosecutors said Kim apparently did not know the money was from
North Korea, so the only charge was failing to report it.
   Kim, who ran for president in 1971 and 1987, has denied having
anything to do with Suh's trip to North Korea or his alleged
espionage.
   Suh, 52, was elected to the National Assembly in April 1988. He
was expelled from Kim's party after his trip was made public.
   Fighting was reported at two Seoul universities after police
blocked attempts by 1,400 students to march into the streets after
campus rallies. No injuries were reported.
   A main theme of the protests was the arrest of a radical woman
student who returned home across the land border at the Panmunjom
truce village Aug. 15 from an illegal trip to North Korea.
   Im Su-kyong visited the North in late June to attend a world
youth festival July 1-8. She said her trip was a symbolic gesture
for reunification.
   At Hankook University of Foreign Studies, about 400 students
fought police with firebombs and rocks for two hours before police
drove them back to the campus with tear gas.
   The students demanded the release of Miss Im and repeal of the
national security laws. They also demanded withdrawal of the 43,000
American soldiers stationed in South Korea.
   At Seoul National University, about 800 riot police firing tear
gas from two armored vans blocked 1,000 students from leaving
campus. The students at Seoul National did not use firebombs.

   President Bush bade farewell to the
visiting prime minister of Denmark today, then hit a snag in his
vacation when his speedboat became became snarled in a line and was
disabled.
   The summer White House, meanwhile, prepared to turn its attention
later in the day to a package of new assistance for combating drugs
in Colombia. Officials said details of the $2.5 million aid package
would be announced here later today.
   Asked whether he would send helicopters or other equipment to
help Colombia fight the drug lords, Bush replied, ``We're working on
the problem. There's a lot going on on that front ... We're working
to accommodate President (Virgilio) Barco ... We're working now with
his people in Washington.''
   Bush escorted his house guests, Danish Prime Minister Poul
Schlueter and his wife, Anne Marie, to the helicopter pad on his
11-acre vacation compound here.
   The Schlueters, who are on their honeymoon, arrived Thursday and
were traveling to Boston after leaving Maine.
   Although Bush said Thursday that he and Schlueter, whom he first
met at the United Nations in the 1970s, would discuss ``fascinating
changes'' in Europe and the international war on narcotics, the two
first families spent much of their time boating and fishing.
   Bush, asked by reporters about apparently dimmed prospects that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega will step down as Panama's military
ruler, shrugged his shoulders and said, ``We just keep on going.''
   He had no other coments as he waved a farewell to his guests.
   Bush then went out for a fishing trip, taking two reporters
along, but returned to the dock after only a few minutes.
   The president's boat, Fidelity, appeared to have run over a
lobster trap line and one of its two propellers was disabled.
   Despite efforts by a underwater frogman to unsnarl the line, Bush
and his party left the boat and it was taken to a local marina for
repairs.
   On Thursday, Bush voiced praise for the new Solidarity-led
government in Poland, complimenting both the old and the new regimes
in a carefully worded statement. That day, Poland became the first
Soviet-bloc nation to have a non-communist-led government.
   Bush said in the statement that Poles ``will have our continued
support as they meet the serious economic and political challenges
before them.''
   He congratulated the new Polish prime minister, former Solidarity
activist Tadeusz Mazowieck.
   ``I also salute President (Wojciech) Jaruzelski for his political
wisdom in endorsing a government reflecting the genuine will of the
Polish people and Solidarity, under the leadership of Lech Walesa,
for its constructive role in helping bring about a new beginning in
Poland,'' the president said.
   ``These developments hold promise not only for a peaceful
democratic transition in Poland but also for a broader process of
European reconcilation, toward a Europe whole and free.''
   The vacation White House, meanwhile, had little to say on new
violence in Colombia, which presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said was being closely monitored.
   Authorities in Colombia said drug traffickers Thursday bombed the
headquarters of two political parties and set fire to two
politicians' homes, killing one person.
   Meanwhile, Bush, who has yet to catch a fish despite daily
fishing outings in his power boat, was presented a 5-pound haddock
by a local fisherman as the president gave the Danish couple a boat
tour of the Kennebunkport waterfront.
   ``He gave it to me,'' Bush told onlookers, showing the fish.
``It's the only way I can get them.''

<HEAD>U.S. Urges Cease-Fire in Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Friday urged warring
Angolan factions to reach a cease-fire to end the outbreak of
violence in the civil war there.
   ``In order for there to be an effective cease-fire, there must be
a comprehensive cease-fire agreement. Such an agreement would be in
the interest of both sides,'' said State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   Angola's UNITA guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi on Thursday
renounced a truce that began in June. The agreement between Savimbi
and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was designed to end
the 14-year civil war.
   The truce began collapsing the week after it began. UNITA on
Friday said 77 government troops and six of its rebels were killed
in heavy fighting this week.
   F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's acting president, and Zaire's
President Mobutu Sese Seko agreed at a summit meeting Friday in
Goma, Zaire, to cooperate in trying to salvage the Angolan peace
agreement.
   Mobutu has been spearheading efforts to negotiate a settlement of
Angola's civil war, and South Africa has endorsed his initiative
after ending its material support for UNITA.
   Boucher said the United States was urging Angolan factions ``to
resume negotiations under Zairean mediation'' to reach a cease-fire
agreement.
   Western-backed UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, has been fighting the
government and its Cuban allies to force a power-sharing agreement
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   UNITA was not party to U.S.-brokered international accords signed
in New York in which South Africa pledged to halt aid to the
guerrillas and allow Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia, to gain
independence. In return, Cuba began a phased withdrawal of its
estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.
   UNITA still receives $15 million to $18 million annually in U.S.
military aid.

<HEAD>Baker Will Sit out Meeting Due to Lack Of Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will sit
out next week's close of the Paris peace conference on Cambodia
because of the lack of progress on a truce and power-sharing
arrangement, the State Department said Friday.
   Accusing Vietnam and its surrogate government in Cambodia of
inflexibility, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
``Secretary Baker does not plan at this time to return to Paris for
the August 28th to 30th ministerial session.''
   Baker took part in the opening round of the talks that seek an
agreement between the Cambodian government and a rebel coalition
backed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk once Vietnam withdraws the last of
its troops next month.
   Boucher said there had been too little pogress on the central
sticking point of the talks _ who would take part in a transitional
government that will rule Cambodia until free elections can be
arranged.
   ``Prince Sihanouk has demonstrated admirable flexibility in
attempting to resolve this key power-sharing problem,'' Boucher
said. ``Unfortunately, his reasonable attitude has not been
reciprocated by Hanoi or the Phnom Penh regime. At this point,
therefore, a comprehensive settlement is not in sight.''
   The Paris conference, under the sponsorship of 19 countries and
the United Nations, sent a fact-finding U.N. team to Cambodia to
gather information for establishment of a peacekeeping force that
would oversee the withdrawal of the estimated 26,000 Vietnamese
troops and implementation of a cease-fire.
   The United States wants Sihanouk to head an interim government.
But Cambodian leader Hun Sen rejects any participation by Sihanouk's
main coalition partner, the China-backed Khmer Rouge. The communist
faction ruled Cambodia in the 1970s and is believed to have killed
more than 1 million people before being forced out by Vietnam in
1978.
   U.S. officials say Sihanouk has offered the working groups in
Paris several formulas for power-sharing, while Hun Sen has failed
to concede any role for Sihanouk except at the head of a commission
to oversee elections.
   Sihanouk believes that if the Khmer Rouge are left out of an
interim government they will fight and endanger chances for peace,
U.S. officials say. But he is also thought to believe that a new
Cambodian government can eventually split the Khmer Rouge by weeding
out and removing the most dangerous elements within the faction.

<HEAD>Administrator Suspends Action on Mining in National Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Surface Mining, under fire in
Congress for allowing strip mining in a southern Ohio national
forest, said Friday it was suspending the mining company's permit
pending further study.
   The agency's new director, Harry M. Snyder, suspended the ruling
that cleared the way for Belville Coal Co. to apply for state mining
permits on government-protected land in the Wayne National Forest.
   ``The entire matter is on hold,'' said Snyder, who wants the
paperwork refiled and the procedures leading up the controversial
decision repeated.
   ``The critical issue is making sure fair and open procedures are
followed in reaching a decision,'' he said in a prepared statement.
   In a letter to the coal company, the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources and the U.S. Forest Service, which opposes mining in the
southern Ohio forest, Snyder said ``indications exist that OSM may
not have followed its own internal procedures.''
   That same charge was leveled in June by Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va.
   Investigators for the House mining subcommittee, which Rahall
heads, concluded the Interior Department agency failed to get
independent documentation and skimpily reviewed company documents
before deciding Belville had a valid right to mine for coal in the
national forest.
   Rahall asked the agency to freeze action on all pending coal
rights claims until the Interior Department finishes the lengthy
process of putting a federal standard in place.
   Snyder didn't respond to that request, and the decision he
announced Friday applied only to the Ohio case.
   Snyder said his action came as a result of his review of the
overall issue of mining rights on protected land, and stressed that
it doesn't necessarily mean the Ohio ruling will be changed.
   In a reversal of a 1986 decision, Ironton, Ohio-based Belville in
December received a crucial bureaucratic approval saying it had the
right to strip mine for coal on 5,440 acres of the national forest.
   So far the company has applied for state mining permits covering
about 180 of those acres, but the permits had not been yet been
issued.
   The Forest Service owns surface rights and manages the
190,000-acre Wayne National Forest and vigorously opposes Belville's
proposal.
   It argues that the federal government should have followed state
standards since there's no federal standard to apply when companies
buy previous owners' mineral rights and seek to mine on
government-protected land.
   The Forest Service also claimed the mineral rights Belville
bought in 1983 and 1984 do not specify coal mining, but instead
cover the strip-mining of fire clay and any coal incidental to the
clay-mining. Fire clay is used in brick making.

<HEAD>White House Sends $65 Million to Colombia to Fight Drug Cartel</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs; Adds Medellin travel warning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today authorized a $65
million emergency drug-fighting package consisting largely of
helicopters, assault boats, small arms and other equipment to help
Colombia fight its war against drug lords.
   Violence by drug gangs ``threatens the very fabric'' of life in
Colombia, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, justifying
the immediate aid.
   ``The recent wave of threats by the drug cartel ... makes it
clear it is time for the United States and other nations to stand
with President (Virgilio) Barco against these insidious forces,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   Fitzwater said Colombia's president had made it clear he would
``welcome U.S. material and support.''
   The aid to the South American nation includes Huey and Blackhawk
helicopters, 18-man assault boats, jeeps, machine guns, grenade
launchers, other small arms and medical supplies.
   Fitzwater said no U.S. troops have been requested by the
Colombians, and he added, ``The United States has complete
confidence in the ability of the Colombian police and military'' to
fight the drug cartel.
   He said U.S. advisers would be sent to train the Colombians in
use of the equipment, and said he wanted to emphasize ``we do not
anticipate that they would be in a combat role.''
   The $65 million will be in addition to $2.5 million in security
aid aimed at helping the Colombians protect their judges, who have
been the principal target for assassination by drug traffickers,
according to administration sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Fitzwater said there would be additional money for
Colombia in the anti-drug strategy unveiled by President Bush on
Sept. 5.
   Fitzwater said the $65 million would be drawn from a special fund
available to the White House for emergency situations. Some $75
million is set aside each year for such situations, about $10
million of which has been spent thus far this fiscal year, said
another administration official.
   Fitzwater said the equipment would arrive in Colombia in the next
week to 14 days.
   ``The purpose is to get it there fast,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush, asked on the golf course today whether he would send
helicopters or other equipment to Colombia, said: ``We're working on
the problem. There's a lot going on on that front ... We're working
to accommodate President (Virgilio) Barco ... We're working now with
his people in Washington.''
   In Washington, the State Department strongly urged Americans to
avoid travel to Medellin, the headquarters of the drug traffickers'
cartel.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the travel advisory was being
issued in light of the violent campaign being waged by the cartel in
retaliation for the government crackdown against drug traffickers.
   Boucher also said the United States was sending two Bell
helicopters to the South American nation today to help police.
   ``This is an intensive and courageous effort on the part of the
Colombians, and one in which we are happy to be supportive. We will
be happy to stand with the Colombian government and people as they
deal with this problem,'' said Boucher.
   ``The thing they really need is transport equipment'' to conduct
raids and ferret out the producers of illicit drugs that are shipped
to the United States illegally, said one source.
   The apparent declaration of war by drug lords against the
Colombian government ``certainly heightens the concern about
security, both for the Colombian government and for ourselves,''
State Department spokesman Boucher said Thursday.
   The bombing wave ``dramatizes, I would say, what we've long
known, and that's that these drug traffickers represent a very
concrete threat to the institutions of the government of Colombia,''
Boucher said.
   To help Colombia meet that threat, he said, the Justice
Department is moving ahead on a stalled $2 million program to train
security personnel for Colombian courts that are handling the drug
cases.
   And State Department officials announced they are sending
Colombia $500,000 to ``be used to purchase non-lethal equipment''
including ``armored vehicles, bomb disposal equipment, radio
direction finders, personal protection equipment, and forensic lab
equipment.''
   Colombian Justice Minister Monica de Greiff was quoted in
Thursday's Washington Post as saying the U.S. Embassy refused to
allow the Colombian government to use some of the money to buy
armored cars, but State Department officials said those remarks
apparently were based on a misunderstanding.
   Boucher said U.S. and Colombian officials were consulting on how
to best use the remaining $2.5 million appropriated by Congress to
help that country.
   Administration officials said the latest violence in Colombia
caused no injuries to Americans or damage to U.S. facilities and
that they had no plans to withdraw any U.S. personnel stationed
there. Without such a plan the government would not even necessarily
pay for travel of U.S. dependents who want to leave, Boucher said.
   The mission remained in a heightened state of alert, meaning that
the 100 U.S. officials at the embassy in Bogota and two dozen Drug
Enforcement Administration agents there kept low profiles, officials
said.
   The bombings followed a drug crackdown inspired by the
assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a leading Colombian presidential
candidate and an outspoken foe of drug traffickers.
   The state of siege allows for quick extraditions of alleged drug
traffickers wanted on U.S. charges. Those extraditions ended
abruptly in 1987 when the Colombian Supreme Court, under pressure
from traffickers, overturned the extradition agreement. The
traffickers have indicated that extradition is one of their major
concerns due to their fears that they would not be able to escape as
they have in Colombia.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Brenda Lee has settled a $20
million lawsuit over recording royalties with MCA Records, her
lawyer, Aleta Arthur, said Friday.
   U.S. District Judge John Nixon ordered details sealed and
confidential, at the request of both Miss Lee and MCA.
   Miss Lee sued MCA a year ago, claiming she had been cheated out
of royalties from record sales dating to 1962. MCA lawyers countered
that the legal time had expired years ago for her to make the claim.
   The lawsuit said MCA failed to account to her for more than 180
record albums released outside the United States. The lawsuit also
sought royalties on sales of recordings with other artists as well
as close-out and promotional records that included a 25th
anniversary album.
   She became an international child star in 1956 with the hit,
``I'm Sorry.'' She signed an exclusive contract with Decca Records
in 1962, renewing it four times through 1977. MCA acquired Decca in
1971.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Friday
that countries considering harboring drug traffickers who fled their
native Colombia's crackdown should take heed of the violence
plaguing that nation.
   ``I think any nation around the world is certainly going to take
notice of the enormous cost that Colombia is paying for letting
these criminals proceed to dominate the processes of law,''
Thornburgh said. ``I would hope that any country where these
individuals seek refuge will respond accordingly.''
   But Thornburgh said he could not confirm reports that some of the
drug kingpins had fled to Brazil or Panama.
   ``As usual, when you're looking for fugitives, there are a number
of reported sightings, but I don't think I could give you anything
with authority,'' he said.
   As for Eduardo Martinez Romero _ the one person arrested in
Colombia's nationwide sweep who the United States has said it wants
to extradite _ Thornburgh said the extradition proceedings ``have
about been completed.''
   ``Our hope is that we will be in a position to deliver over the
weekend the necessary documentation to Colombian officials,''
Thornburgh said.
   Martinez was indicted in March in Atlanta on charges of
laundering money for the Medellin cocaine cartel, reputed to be the
largest in the world.
   While Colombian authorities have said they have arrested other
people who are wanted on charges in the United States, Thornburgh
did not respond when asked if the Justice Department was seeking
their extradition as well.
   Other administration officials have said they are unfamiliar with
the other people arrested.
   Although Thornburgh and Colombian Minister of Justice Monica de
Greiff had planned to meet this week to discuss extradition
procedures, the Colombia embassy in Washington said Friday that Ms.
de Greiff remained in Bogota following an outbreak of bombings and
fires in Medellin allegedly set by drug traffickers who declared
``total war'' on the government.
   The Colombian Supreme Court, under threat from drug traffickers,
threw out an extradition treaty in 1987. Colombian President
Virgilio Barco resumed extraditions last weekend in an emergency
action following the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a leading
presidential candidate who strongly opposed the drug trade.
   Meanwhile, Thornburgh said it was unclear what impact the
Colombian crackdown was having on the flow of cocaine from Colombia
to the United States.
   ``That's hard to say,'' the attorney general said. ``The ultimate
dislocation of the cocaine problem in the United States is going to
come when people quit using cocaine.''

   John F. Kennedy Jr.'s first week as a prosecutor
ended Friday with an acquittal _ his, on a charge of driving an
uninsured vehicle, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said.
   Kennedy's attorney, Richard A. Halloran, brought evidence to the
DMV office in Queens that his client's car was insured when police
ticketed the presidential son on July 9, said DMV spokesman Tom
Apple.
   The charge was then dismissed, although DMV has six months to
verify the Kennedy documents, Apple said. The uninsured vehicle
charge was the most serious of four against Kennedy; he could have
lost his license for one year if convicted.
   Kennedy, who joined the Manhattan district attorney's office on
Monday, did not appear at the hearing Friday.
   A charge of driving an unregistered car was put off until Sept.
29, which is also the deadline for Kennedy to pay a $127 fine on his
guilty pleas to speeding and driving an uninspected vehicle, Apple
said.

   The mayor prayed on the 50-yard line as
10 protesters blew horns and jeered in one of the first gridiron
confrontations over a court ban on invocations at high school
athletic events.
   Mayor Emory Folmar's prayer ended with six people being escorted
out of Cramton Bowl for sounding airhorns. One protester was
arrested for struggling as he was led out of the stands.
   Folmar said Friday his actions were justified by the response of
the 5,000 fans who attended the high school football game. Most
cheered at the end of prayers by Folmar and County Commission
Chairman Bill Joseph.
   ``I didn't know it was big news. We've been praying at football
games for 50 years. I wasn't trying to make a point,'' said Folmar,
a conservative and former chairman of the Alabama Republican Party.
   But a civil libertarian said the Thursday night episode
highlighted the difficulty Southerners have dealing with religious
diversity and a Jan. 3 ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. The court ruled that prayers before school-sponsored events
violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and
state.
   On May 30, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand that decision, which
upheld a student's lawsuit to prevent pre-game prayers in Douglas
County, Ga. The ruling affected only Florida, Georgia and Alabama,
and was largely ignored until the Supreme Court refused to overturn
it.
   ``I am a Southerner, and traditionally in the South we have been
so homogeneous religiously that people are unable to put themselves
in the place of the minority,'' said University of Alabama law
professor Martha Morgan, a state board member of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   Whatever the interpretation of the pre-game ceremony, it appears
the issue will wind up back in court.
   Olivia Turner, state director for the ACLU, said a lawsuit over
the prayers was ``highly likely.''
   ``We're going to fight the charge of harassing police,'' said
Jeff Shannon, 23, the college student who spent more than an hour in
jail following his arrest on that charge at Thursday night's game.
   Since the Supreme Court decision, many school systems in Florida,
Georgia and Alabama have expressed displeasure with the ruling while
saying they would abide by it.
   In Childersburg on Thursday night, a group of about 100 people
led fans in a spontaneous recitation of the Lord's Prayer during a
game between B.B. Comer High School and Childersburg High.
   This week, all across Alabama, radio stations are broadcasting
prayers at 6:55 p.m. _ five minutes before most prep games start _
and are asking fans to take portable radios to the stadiums.
   Mayor Folmar, however, decided to take it a step further before
the season opener between Robert E. Lee High School and Jess Lanier
High. He walked onto the field, took the public address microphone
and led the crowd in prayer.
   ``We thank you Lord that we do live in a free land, a free land
where we can pray,'' said Folmar. ``Bless us now, keep our players
safe.''
   In the stands, the handful of protesters wore T-shirts scrawled
with sayings like ``The Constitution Rules'' and ``Church and State
Don't Mix.'' Police stopped them from unfurling a banner and took
the airhorns because both are prohibited in the city-owned stadium,
said police Lt. Robert Hankins.
   The mayor said the arrest of Shannon and the ejection of the
other protesters was prompted by their use of the ear-splitting
horns, not by their opposition to him.
   Folmar argued his pre-game prayer was legal because he is
independent of the school system and the game was played a
city-owned stadium that is the site for the home games of all
Montgomery high schools.
   He said he would pay the legal expenses arising from the defense
of any lawsuit over his actions. ``There won't be one dime of
taxpayers' money spent,'' said the mayor.
   That was welcome news to Henry Spears, chairman of the Montgomery
County Board of Education, which was reponsible for the football
game.
   ``Our position is that we had no control,'' Spears said. ``We had
control over the game, but we have no control over the mayor.''

   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki met
Friday with emissaries from the superpowers, and Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa called on workers to refrain from strikes to avoid
worsening Poland's dire economic woes.
   Mazowiecki met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Senate
Minority leader Robert Dole and three Democratic congressmen. He
later met with the Soviet ambassador and West German envoys.
   Mrs. Dole said after the meeting with the prime minister that
Washington would consider new ways to aid the country, but would not
say whether that included additional financial assistance.
   Mazowiecki assumed office on Thursday in a historic transfer of
power from the Communist Party to a Solidarity-led coalition, the
first government led by non-Communists in the East bloc.
   Walesa, who convinced Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski to
approve the Solidarity-led government, said in a statement Friday
that Mazowiecki's selection was the ``breakthrough'' needed to stop
Poland's economic decline.
   Walesa said dramatic changes were needed by the government but
called on workers to limit strikes to avoid causing further economic
damage.
   ``In face of so critical an employment situation, radical actions
of the government are needed. At the same, we must radically limit
economic losses which are an ovbious result of any strike
struggle,'' he said in a statement.
   ``We must save Poland not at the cost of other people but
together,'' he said.
   In a rare show of support that would have been unthinkable only
months ago, Communist Party chief Miezcyslaw F. Rakowski, who is on
an official visit to Bulgaria, sent Mazowiecki a telegram Friday
saying the new prime minister could count on the party's support
``in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis.''
   Dole, R-Kansas, said Mazowiecki told him: ```He who helps early,
helps twice.' In other words, this is very important now to keep up
the momentum and let the Polish people see some change.''
   But Mrs. Dole was cautious about offering more financial aid to
Poland.
   ``Obviously, we do have a budget deficit at home,'' she said.
``We will provide aid as we can, when we can, but there is already a
very significant program underway.''
   She was referring to Bush's $115 million aid offer made during a
July visit. Solidarity leaders have been hoping for a $10 billion
assistance package from Western countries.
   Later, the Doles met for over an hour with Jaruzelski. Mrs. Dole
said they delivered a letter from President Bush to Jaruzelski
congratulating him ``on his wisdom and his leadership in this
difficult time, this time of transition and the progress that is
being made in forming a new government, his cooperation in that
process.''
   She said a similar letter was delivered to Mazowiecki.
   At Mazowiecki's meeting with Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov,
the ambassador congratulated Mazowiecki on his election and
Mazowiecki sent greetings to the Soviet people, a government
spokesman said.
   Mazowiecki's election has brought reserved support from the
Soviet Union.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said Friday in
Moscow that Soviet officials were ``happy to hear'' Mazowiecki's
remarks Thursday about Poland remaining in the Warsaw Pact and
Comecon socialist economic alliance.
   ``The sensible and constructive approach by the head of the
Polish government to these issues, which have paramount significance
for the peoples of the two countries, coincides with our wishes,''
Gremitskikh said.
   Mrs. Dole said Bush would soon send a team of U.S. experts to
Poland to study what priorities such aid would take.
   Referring to unemployment that will result as inefficient
industries are closed under economic reform plans, she said Poland
would have to lay ``a safety net for workers as they go through this
transition, which obviously is going to produce difficulties.''
   Mazowiecki also met U.S. Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and
Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, and U.S. Rep. Jim Moody of
Wisconsin, all Democrats. The three represent the congressional
committee that oversees compliance with the Helsinki accords on
human rights.
   DeConcini called Mazowiecki's election ``a wager on freedom we
cannot afford to lose,'' and said he would return to the United
States to support increased aid to Poland.
   Wales, in his statement, appealed to striking railway workers in
the central city of Lodz to stop their protest.
   ``I turn to Lodz railwaymen to display resolve in stopping the
increasingly dangerous strike in the region. A strike action ... now
has a character of a provocation aimed against the first prime
minister elected at Solidarity's initiative,'' he said.
   Communist Party First Secretary Miezcyslaw F. Rakowski, who is on
an official visit to Bulgaria, sent Mazowiecki a telegram Friday
saying the new prime minister could count on the party's support
``in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis.''

   President Bush sent congratulatory
messages to Poland's new non-communist prime minister, Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, and to communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, whom he
praised for ``leading Poland through a very difficult period,'' a
Bush spokesman said Friday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had sent
the personal messages to Warsaw on Thursday by diplomatic cable, and
that they were hand-delivered to the two leaders by the U.S.
ambassador.
   Bush's ``personal message'' to Mazowiecki, the Soviet Bloc's
first non-communist leader, conveyed ``warmest congratulations,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``The president said he looks to Poland's future with hope and
confidence at this historic moment.''
   Fitzwater added: ``The president also sent a message to President
Jaruzelski congratulating him for his wisdom and statesmanship in
leading Poland through a very difficult period.''
   Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity union activist, was elected prime
minister Thursday by Poland's parliament and will lead a coalition
government.
   The administration has promised $119 million in economic aid to
Poland.
   Fitzwater said the administration steadfastly stands by its
commitment to provide this help.

   A man charged with drowning his four children and
trying to kill his wife by driving their car into a river ``lived
for those kids'' and is innocent, the wife said.
   ``Right now, I love him with every ounce of my body,'' Suzanne
DeLisle told The Detroit News in a story published Friday. ``There's
no doubt in my mind what happened. It was a complete and total
accident. I know how hard he tried to stop the car.''
   Lawrence DeLisle was arrested Aug. 10 and charged with four
counts of first-degree murder and one of attempted murder. The
family's car slammed through a barricade and into the Detroit River
in Wyandotte on Aug. 3, killing their children, Bryan, 8, Melissa,
4, Kathryn, 2, and Emily, 8 months.
   DeLisle and his wife escaped and passing boaters rescued them.
   DeLisle, 28, initially said a leg cramp caused him to jam down
the gas pedal and careen into the river. But police said he later
admitted that, distraught over deep debts, he deliberately plunged
the car into the river.
   Mrs. DeLisle, 32, told the News she thought police coerced her
husband into making the admission.
   ``They were using every technique in the book on him and he
cracked,'' she said in an interview from a relative's home in Tampa,
Fla.
   ``He lived for those kids. We never did anything without them,''
she said. ``He would never have hurt the kids.''
   ``I have lost four of the most precious things in my life. That's
all I ever wanted was children,'' Mrs. DeLisle said.
   She also said she fears testifying at her husband's preliminary
hearing, scheduled for Thursday.
   ``I don't want them to manipulate me. I don't want to be the one
who locks him away for the rest of his life for something they
mistook and turned around,'' she said.
   DeLisle remains in the Wayne County Jail without bond, and his
wife said he is confused and depressed.
   ``He thinks I blame him, which I don't,'' she said. ``It could
have been me who was driving. It could have been anybody.''

   The value of U.S. farm exports is recovering
much faster than was expected a few months ago and this year may be
close to the record set in the early 1980s, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   As it looks now, commodity exports will be worth $40 billion in
the fiscal year that will end on Sept. 30, up 12 percent from $35.3
billion in the previous year. The new forecast, up $1 billion from
the previous estimate in May, would be less than 9 percent below the
record $43.8 billion in 1981.
   The department attributed much of the gain of 1988 over 1987 to
``improved prospects for exports of cotton, red meats and
horticultural products'' and said larger shipments of rice, seeds,
feed grains and grain products also are expected.
   But all of the export value increase for 1989 over 1988 is due to
higher prices. The report said the actual volume of shipments is
expected to be 147 million metric tons, down from 148.3 million tons
last year.
   The tonnage for 1989 is nearly 10 percent below the 162.3 million
tons exported in 1981.
   ``Preliminary estimates for fiscal 1990 (the year beginning Oct.
1) point to a decline in U.S. agricultural exports due to reduced
volume and prices for most bulk commodities,'' the report said. No
1990 estimates were issued.
   After rising annually for many years to 1981, exports began a
general slide, reaching a decade low of $26.3 billion in 1986. World
economic problems and competition from foreign suppliers were major
reasons.
   The recovery has been accompanied by rising commodity prices and
a tightening of global grain supplies, including sharply lower U.S.
inventories because of last year's drought and short crops.
   Shipments of grains and grain products head the 1989 list at an
estimated $17 billion, up from $12.7 billion in 1988. That included
corn, $6.5 billion, up from $4.33 billion, and wheat and flour, $6.1
billion, up from 4.64 billion.
   Soybean exports were valued at $4.1 billion this year, down from
about $5 billion in 1988.
   Exports of livestock and livestock products were forecast at $5.4
billion, up from $4.9 billion last year; horticultural products,
$4.3 billion, up from $3.82 billion.
   Cotton exports were estimated at $2.2 billion, up slightly from
$2.14 billion in 1988; and tobacco, $1.3 billion, about the same as
last year.

   The National Gallery of Art recently bought its
first work by French artist Francis Picabia, titled ``Machine Turn
Quickly,'' and will put the modernistic image on display Sunday as
part of a long-term exhibition on 20th century art.
   Picabia, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray were the New York leaders of
the so-called dada movement of ``anti-art'' that arose in Europe and
America from disillusionment over the events leading to World War I.
   Dada artists emphasized word play, the absurd and the importance
of chance in artistic creation, and often used machine imagery to
portray human activity.
   Picabia's ``Machine Turn Quickly,'' produced in 1916-18 using
gouache and metallic paint, depicts man and woman as gears enmeshed
in an endlessly repeating cycle.
   National Gallery director J. Carter Brown said the Picabia work,
purchased from a dealer, will be displayed with two other dada works
from the gallery's permanent collection, Duchamp's ``The Box in a
Valise'' and ``Untitled (Medici Prince)'' by Joseph Cornell.

<HEAD>Astronaut Almost Backed Out of Columbia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month before astronaut David Leestma
went into space on the shuttle Columbia, he got news that nearly
prompted him to back out of the mission: His pregnant wife had
breast cancer.
   ``At first, I thought of asking them to find someone to take my
place. I didn't think I should go,'' said Leestma, one of five crew
members on the Columbia, which ended a secret five-day flight Aug.
13.
   ``But Patti is a very strong lady. She would have nothing to do
with that,'' the Muskegon native told The Muskegon Chronicle by
telephone Thursday from his office at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
   Instead, Patti Leestma, due to give birth in December, underwent
a radical mastectomy while her husband finished training for his
flight. She then started chemotherapy.
   When her husband launched into space from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
she was there in the crowd to cheer him on. Five days later, when
the shuttle landed in the desert at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
she and their five children, ages 1 to 9, were there to greet him.
   Leestma, 40, whose only other NASA flight five years ago included
a space walk, said he was eager to get back home.
   ``It didn't affect my job performance or my fascination with
space. But ... well, I'm glad we weren't going up for a long time,
one of those month-long flights.''
   Leestma said he probably would pass up many of the special
appearances and speaking engagements that usually follow NASA
flights.
   ``I'm not in a big mood to go traveling right now,'' he said.
``My place is close to home.''
   Leestma's previous scheduled space flight, the shuttle that was
supposed to track Halley's Comet in early 1987, was canceled because
of the Challenger disaster that killed seven crew members.
   Just before Leestma's flight this month, his 7-year-old daughter,
Katie, asked, ``But what if you don't come back, Daddy?''
   ``I guess I didn't realize how the visions of (the Challenger
flight) is still in their minds,'' Leestma said. ``She made me
think: `Why am I taking this risk?'''
   He said he found solace in his answer.
   ``The risk is part of my job,'' he told her. ``And I do it
because I think it's very, very important for the country and the
world.''

<HEAD>Soviet Envoy Meets With Christian Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet envoy met Friday with the leader
of Lebanon's Christian forces in an effort to end the deadly war
with Syria, a key Soviet ally.
   Soviet diplomat Gennady Tarasov, who later flew to Syria,
described the talks with Christian commander Gen. Michel Aoun as
``useful.'' An Aoun spokesman characterized the talks as positive.
   Also Friday, French radio said vessels from the U.S. 6th Fleet
were anchored 50 miles off Lebanon, and that a Soviet missile
launcher was heading toward the Mediterranean to join other ships
already there.
   The Soviet government denied the report.
   At the Pentagon, Cmdr. Mel Sunden said it was likely the Iowa and
another 6th Fleet vessel, the Coral Sea, both were in the eastern
Mediterranean Friday. But he said the U.S. activity was routine and
the nations were not combining forces.
   Police said at least three people were killed and eight wounded
in clashes in Beirut Friday, in which Syrian gunners also launched
scores of rockets and mortar rounds at a 28-mile coastal stretch in
the Christian heartland.
   The new casualities brought the overall toll to 794 people killed
and 2,222 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between Christian
forces and Moslem-allied Syrian troops.
   The Syrians, who have 40,000 troops in Lebanon, control all land
exits from the Christian enclave and shell the coastline regularly
to prevent resupplies from reaching Christian units of commander
Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The Soviet envoy crossed Beirut's dividing Green Line for
separate meetings Friday with the Maronite Catholic patriarch,
Nasrallah Sfeir, north of Beirut, then with Aoun, in the bunker of
the devastated Presidential Palace in suburban Baabda.
   On arrival for the meeting with Aoun, Tarasov, who heads the
Middle East department at the Foreign Ministry, had to abandon his
car 500 yards from the palace and walk up a driveway blanketed with
debris and glass shards.
   Aoun has been living in the heavily fortified bunker under the
two-story palace for five months while Syrian gunners shell the
compound daily.
   Talking to reporters after his two-hour session at Baabda,
Tarasov said: ``We have just completed a useful exchange on the
situation in Lebanon.''
   The Soviet government, he told reporters, was ``deeply concerned
about the suffering of the Lebanese people, the loss of human life
and the material damage.''
   ``Of course we view his proposals positively,'' an aide to Aoun
said, refusing to give details.
   Tarasov earlier met in west Beirut with acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads a Syrian-backed Cabinet
competing for legitimacy with Aoun's government. The Soviet envoy
later left for Damascus.
   Syria is the Soviet Union's chief Arab ally, although the two
countries often differ on Middle East politics. Tarasov's meeting
with Aoun defied Syria's rejection of Aoun as the voice of
Christians and a negotiating partner. Moscow had cautioned Damascus
in 1976 against intervention in Lebanon. But Syria considers its
eastern neighbor within its sphere of influence and vital to its
security.
   Beirut sources said the Soviet proposal calls for ``stabilizing
the security situation by halting Syrian-Christian clashes.''
   One source said it includes reviving the Arab committee on
Lebanon, which suspended its mediation effort last month, blaming
Syria for the lack of progress.
   Meanwhile, Sheik Sobhi Tofeili, a senior official in Hezbollah,
or Party of God, said the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group was ``in a
state of war with the French forces.''
   A previously unknown group, calling itself the Organization for
the Defense of the Oppressed pledged to ``confront the flagrant
French military intervention in the internal Lebanese affairs.''
   The group, in a hand-written statement delivered to a Western
news agency in Beirut, said its ``mujahideen (holy fighters) are
ready to carry out God's verdict in striking at Western interests,
topped by French interests.''
   France has said its six ships off Lebanon, led by the aircraft
carrier Foch with about 2,000 marines aboard, is on a
``humanitarian'' mission to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 French
nationals living in Lebanon if the situation deteriorates.
   Moslem leaders accuse France, who governed France until 1943, of
favoring Christians in the conflict and that the warships are posted
to protect them.
   Meanwhile, the Vatican said it was trying to arrange a visit by
Pope John Paul II to Lebanon soon, but that it could not yet set a
date. Syria's Moslem allies already have accused the pope of bias
toward the Christians.

   Diplomats in Sofia said Friday that at
least 15 people were killed in southern Bulgaria in mid-August in
clashes involving security forces and members of the 200,000-strong
Pomak minority.
   The state news agency BTA said the report was untrue.
   In many places, soldiers and tanks moved in to quell the unrest,
said the diplomats in the Bulgarian capital, who were reached by
telephone from Vienna and spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They reported deaths in Dobnitsa, Kornitsa and Lozhnitsa in the
Blagoevgrad area and said other casualities occurred in at least a
dozen other villages.
   The actual death toll was likely to be much higher, according to
reports reaching the diplomats. They said no report on wounded was
available.
   The diplomats said the Pomaks, ethnic Bulgarians of Moslem faith,
were protesting government refusal to give them passports to
emigrate to Turkey.
   At least 310,000 ethnic Turks living in Bulgaria have received
passports and crossed to Turkey since May, when communist
authorities said at least nine ethnic Turks died in clashes with
security forces in northern Bulgaria.
   The diplomats put the number of May deaths at 30 or more.
   According to the sources, the new disturbances started this month
in northeastern Bulgaria near Razgrad and Varna on the Black Sea,
where anger flared among the Pomaks over the travel ban.
   In the south, disturbances took place both in Pomak and in mixed
Pomak-Turkish communities, said the diplomatic sources, who
mentioned the villages of Volko Selo, Ribnovo, Khostanie and
Breznitsa.
   Unlike the ethnic Turks, Pomaks have not been granted passports.
Turkey this week closed its border to the ethnic Turks from
Bulgaria, saying they want a formal emigration agreement with Sofia
before allowing more to enter.
   Diplomats said Pomaks were threatened with legal proceedings if
they did not stop applying for passports.
   Bulgaria faces an acute labor shortage with the sudden emigration
of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Turkish workers. Last month,
special regulations empowered authorities to draft labor from towns
to the fields for harvesting.
   Reports of the unrest followed word from emigre sources that
Pomaks in northeastern Bulgaria were conducting hunger strikes to
protest the refusal to grant passports and the continued detention
of six prominent dissidents.

<HEAD>Moldavian Strike Spreads, Officials Appeal for Calm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikes in Moldavia against a pending language law
spread on Friday and the southern republic's government appealed for
calm, the official news agency Tass reported.
   It said railroad workers at Bendery and four other stations held
two-hour strikes. More than 90 factories were idled on Thursday.
   About 50,000 people attended a rally in Tiraspol to urge
postponement of the law, which would make the language of the
Moldavian majority the official one for the republic.
   The Presidium of the republic's legislature said strikes
increased ``the destablization of the socio-political situation.''
It said the law could be considered only in a calm atmosphere.
   Russians, Ukrainians and other non-Moldavians say the law is
discriminatory and would set Moldavia on the same path of
inter-ethnic relations as the three Baltic republics _ Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
   Pravda, the national Communist Party newspaper, said Friday that
no tolerance for minorities remained in Lithuania. ``An overt
division of forces ... is now under way in the republic,'' it
declared.
   It accused leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, who
recently have joined calls for independence from the Soviet Union,
of lacking a clear program of local reform.
   The Moldavian strikes follow the pattern in Estonia, where
non-Estonians walked out for nine days earlier this month to protest
a law setting residency requirements for voting and seeking local
office.
   Protesters in Moldavia also say the republic's government allowed
too little time for public discussion of the law before the
legislature considers it Aug. 29. The draft law was published by the
official press Sunday.
   Leaders of the Moldavian People's Front say the draft proposal
does not go far enough.
   Yuri Rozhgo, a spokesman, said it gives Russian nearly the same
status as Moldavian. He said the People's Front supported the law
but would try to have it amended by the legislature.
   Rozhgo said the People's Front would hold a large rally Sunday in
central Kishinev to press its demands.
   Moldavians make up about 64 percent of the republic's 4.2 million
people but are outnumbered in many major cities, where Russian is
widely used.
   In addition to making Moldavian the official language, the law
would return the republic to the Latin alphabet from the Cyrillic.
After Moldavia was forcibly taken from Romania in 1940, the alphabet
was changed to emphasize the Soviet view that Moldavians and
Romanians were distinct nationalities.

   Two city police officers were charged Friday with
armed robbery and assault in incidents that netted them $140, a
department spokesman said.
   Police said the charges involved two incidents in which the two
officers allegedly worked together.
   Dwight Allen, 28, and Alan C. James, 30, both of Boston, were
arrested after a four-day investigation indicated they were involved
in the robberies, said William Celester, deputy superintendent of
Boston's Roxbury and Mattapan districts.
   The offenses occurred between 11 p.m. Aug. 19 and 1 a.m. Aug. 20
in a busy section of Mattapan, Celester said.
   According to police, in the first incident, one person was robbed
and two companions were assaulted and in the second, money was taken
from one individual.
   The police report said that in the second incident, one of the
officers put a handgun to his victim's neck and identified himself
as a police officer.
   Department spokesman James Jordan said it was the first time he
could remember that a Boston police officer had been arrested on
robbery charges.
   ``We've had incidents where acts of alleged corruption have led
to arrests,'' he said. ``But this is the first of its type, a
robbery.''
   Allen and James were arraigned Friday afternoon on multiple
charges of robbery and assault by means of a dangerous weapon. Bail
was set at $2,500 cash or $25,000 surety.
   The officers, both recruited within the last four years, were off
duty and in street clothes at the time of the alleged robberies,
police said.
   They had at least one gun from which shots may have been fired,
Celester said. No injuries were reported in either incident.
   Police were tracking a third man, who was not immediately
identified, officials said.
   Celester said the arrests were more a boost than a blow to
department morale.
   ``Nobody wants to see a bad police officer and when we do, we act
without shedding a tear,'' Celester said. ``They worked for us and
we clean our own laundry.''

   Salman Rushdie, the novelist threatened with death
by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for writing the book ``The
Satanic Verses,'' is living apart from his American wife, Marianne
Wiggins, she announced Friday through her publisher.
   Secker and Warburg issued a brief statement saying Ms. Wiggins,
herself a writer, and the Indian-born Rushdie ``have been living
separately for four weeks.
   ``Scotland Yard security arrangements for the protection of Mr.
Rushdie have been reordered since then and Ms. Wiggins does not know
where he is,'' the statement said.
   ``Ms. Wiggins requests privacy; She is not prepared to discuss
the matter further.''
   The couple, who were married in January 1988, had been in hiding
since last Feb. 14, when Khomeini said Rushdie should be killed
because ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
   Khomeini died June 3, but his order has not been revoked.
   Before the separation, Ms. Wiggins was quoted as saying they had
moved 56 times, through a succession of ``safe houses'' used for
spies and intelligence contacts.
   They had dined occasionally with friends, literary acquaintances
and political figures, such as Neil Kinnock, leader of the
opposition Labor Party. Such meetings dwindled since March at the
insistence of Rushdie's guards, friends say.
   In an interview published in June in Options, a British women's
magazine, Ms. Wiggins, 41, was quoted as saying she had been
``living the life of a paranoid schizophrenic'' in hiding.
   ``Suddenly, I have been removed from the world and made into this
person alienated in the extreme.''
   The threat forced her to cancel a promotional tour in the United
States for her novel ``John Dollar.''
   Her biggest recent loss was social contact, she was quoted as
saying _ ``The thing about this situation is that one is completely
of good mental health and yet living the life of a paranoid
schizophrenic.'
   Ms. Wiggins grew up in Lancaster, Pa., listening to her
Scots-Irish father preach in a conservative Christian church. Her
mother was Greek and on her 10th birthday, she was baptized in the
Greek Orthodox Church.
   Like her husband, who was raised as a Moslem, she fell away from
her childhood faith.
   Scotland Yard said it never confirmed that Rushdie and Ms.
Wiggins were under guard and it had nothing to say about the impact
of the couple's separation.
   ``We don't discuss security matters,'' a spokeswoman for Scotland
Yard said, speaking under condition of anonymity.

   President Bush said Friday he will
send $65 million worth of helicopters, weapons and other equipment
to help Colombia in its ``courageous'' battle against drug barons
who have proclaimed all-out war against their government.
   The first shipment, a $20 million package of eight Huey transport
helicopters; arms such as machine guns, mortars and ammunition;
4-wheel drive vehicles; ambulances; communciations equipment and
anti-tank guns, will be sent next week, said presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Later shipments will include medical supplies, 12 more Huey
helicopters, a Blackhawk medical evacuation helicopter, assault
boats, trucks, medical supplies and airplanes, Fitzwater said.
   Hours after the announcement, a official who requested anonymity
said discussions were still going on with the Colombians about their
specific needs.
   Fitzwater said no U.S. combat troops will go to Colombia, but
U.S. advisers will be sent to train the Colombians in operating the
U.S. equipment.
   ``It's not anticipated they would be in a combat role,'' he told
reporters accompanying Bush on his vacation here.
   ``Our only motivation is to do as much as we can as fast as we
can,'' the president's spokesman said. ``We have a war situation in
America, let alone in Colombia.''
   Bush, in a statement read by Fitzwater, noted attacks by the drug
lords against the Colombian establishment, including last week's
assassination of a leading presidential candidate, and said:
   ``It is time for the United States and other countries of the
world to stand with President (Virgilio) Barco during his courageous
challenge to these insidious forces that threaten the very fabric of
Colombian society.''
   Officials said Colombia is most in need of transportation to
conduct raids and apprehend the drug cartel operatives.
   The materiel, to be taken from Pentagon stocks, will be paid for
with unspent funds made available through the 1986 Foreign
Assistance Act.
   The act gives the president about $75 million in discretionary
funds yearly; about $10 million has been spent this year, said an
official in Washington.
   Noting that Colombia will get virtually all of the money left for
this year, Fitzwater said, ``Since we're using all the money in the
fund, it stands to reason we could have used more.''
   He also said that the United States has begun shipping a variety
of military gear bought earlier by the Colombian government,
including 20 Huey and five Blackhawk helicopters. The State
Department was also lending Colombia two helicopters.
   The administration's $65 million aid package does not include
those helicopters.
   Fitzwater said Bush would propose sending additional aid to
Colombia in the Sept. 5 speech in which he will detail his
administration's plan to battle drugs.
   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, said that he supports the administration's decision and
that the United States must be united with Colombia in the drug
fight.
   ``The drug problem will not be solved solely through the use of
military measures,'' Mitchell said in a statement. Nevertheless, he
added, ``the drug dealers cannot be allowed to prevail in this
struggle simply because they are willing to ignore all norms of
civil society.''
   The $65 million package will be in addition to $2.5 million worth
of U.S. security assistance to help protect Colombian judges, the
primary assassination targets of the drug cartels.
   On Thursday, a paramilitary squad run by the powerful Medellin
cartel declared it would wage ``total and absolute war on the
government, on the industrial and political oligarchy,'' and others
the drug lords consider their enemies.
   Noting that, the State Department on Friday advised Americans to
avoid Medellin.
   U.S. aid to Colombia in fiscal 1989 was $29.6 million, said State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher. Of that, $6 million was in
military assistance, $1 million in military training, $7.6 million
in development assistance, $10 million for the drug war, and $5
million to protect judges.
   Of the $5 million in judicial protection, $500,000 has been
earmarked for armored cars and other equipment, and $2 million in a
program to train court security guards.
   U.S. and Colombia officials are working together to decide how
best to spend the remaining $2.5 million in judicial protection,
said Boucher.

   Voyager 2 brushed by Neptune's north pole
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,
fault-cracked Triton, revealing ``a world unlike any we've ever
seen,'' NASA said Friday.
   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar
system,'' said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom,
deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m PDT Friday.
   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American space
technology,'' Vice President Dan Quayle told hundreds of scientists
and dignitaries Friday at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I am exceedingly
delighted to be here on this very historic day for America and
America's space program.''
   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons in
addition to Nereid and frost-covered Triton, which were first
observed from Earth.
   The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around
the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will
also prove to be a complete ring.
   Voyager's closest photos of Triton were recorded on tape for
playback to earth this weekend, but those returned Friday astounded
scientists. Soderblom said they showed at least three volcanoes, now
inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen
natural gas or nitrogen ice.
   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any
we've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone.
   While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been
seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some other moons, ``it's the first
time we've seen an icy volcano,'' Stone said, referring to one of
the huge craters on Triton. ``This is a real volcano.''
   But Stone noted that Triton's volcanoes are ``filled with ice
instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.''
   NASA geologist Joseph Boyce said one of the ice volcanoes _ which
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures
several hundred miles across.
   Other Triton photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying
cliffs and ``ice structures of various sorts, like glacier
terrain,'' JPL scientist Torrence Johnson said. ``They're like
things you see in polar caps on Mars.''
   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the
place,'' Soderblom said, adding that the faults suggest
``Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon.
   Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets of
parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy ``erupted
plastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleys
or erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is
``using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,''
Soderblom said.
   He said scientists don't yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices
and other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted.
   Earth and Jupiter's moon Io are the only objects in the solar
system known to have volcanoes that are currently active.
   Voyager also revealed Triton has an atmosphere, as predicted.
It's content wasn't immediately determined, but NASA said the haze
might be like photochemical smog.
   Stone said the discovery that Triton's surface once was
geologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbiting
moon _ about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon _ once was a
comet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around Neptune.
   Under that theory, Triton initially would have orbited Neptune in
a long ellipse, but Neptune's gravity slowly pulled it into a
circular orbit, making Triton a semi-molten, geologically active
ball for the first billion years after its capture, he said.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Saturday, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles from
Earth and 1.385 million miles from Neptune, speeding away from the
giant planet at 37,847 mph.
   The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in Neptune's bluish
atmosphere, as well as cloud ``streamers'' stretching thousands of
miles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclone
called the Great Dark Spot.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,
Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its trip to Neptune followed a
4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75
billion miles from Earth.
   Voyager 1 also was launched in 1977, exploring Jupiter in 1979
and Saturn in 1980 before speeding out of the plane of the planets.
   Until its official ``near encounter'' period ends Oct. 2, Voyager
2 will look back over its shoulder at Neptune. Then it, like Voyager
1, will head toward interstellar space.
   ``Voyager 2 is now past Neptune and is continuing to press
outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,''
NASA administrator Richard Truly said. ``The Voyagers are destined
to wander through the Milky Way. ... What wonders they will
encounter.''
   Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of NASA, called the
climax of the Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last time
we're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed the
reconnaissance of the planets, except Pluto.''

   This year's filbert harvest in Oregon and
Washington is estimated at 13,500 tons, down 18 percent from 1988
and the smallest output since 1984, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   The Oregon crop of filberts, or hazelnuts, was forecast at 13,300
tons, compared with 16,300 tons in 1988. The Washington harvest was
indicated at 200 tons, the same as last year.
   Officials said filbert trees, particularly of the Barcelona
variety, were hurt by severe cold in early February during their
crucial pollination stage.
   ``As a result, nut set is lighter than in 1988,'' the report
said. ``Also, growers report a larger-than-normal number of blanks.
Nut size, however, is up significantly from last year.''

   An elementary school principal who
admitted he let a male prostitute use offices in the building has
been suspended and will not be allowed to return to work there, the
president of the school board said Friday.
   And in the narrow neighborhood streets that surround Chevy Chase
Elementary School in this upscale suburb of Washington, D.C., few
people were aware of what went on for several months since Gabriel
Massaro became principal two years ago.
   Massaro, who was suspended with pay from his job after school
officials read an article about his activities in The Washington
Times on Friday, admitted in an interview with the newspaper he had
a four-year relationship with a call-boy and gave him access to
facilities at the school.
   The prostitute, who the newspaper said used the alias of Greg
Davis, was identified Friday by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., as Steve
Gobie. Frank said he had a two-year relationship with the
prostitute, beginning in 1985.
   Massaro was not at home and was not at the school on Friday.
   ``Right now he is suspended and there will be an acting principal
in the school on Monday,'' said James Cronin, president of the
Montgomery County School Board. ``So far as the children are
concerned, his presence won't be a factor.
   ``What will happen in the future, I don't know,'' Cronin added.
``But I think it will be safe to say he will not return to Chevy
Chase Elementary.''
   Debra Wood, co-chair of the Chevy Chase Elementary School PTA,
said ``I really don't have any comment. The matter is under
investigation. It's unfortunate ... kind of takes you by surprise.
And it's too bad.''
   The prostitute told the Times he had used a guidance counselor's
office at the school, usually in the evenings, where he used the
telephone to set up appointments with his customers. He said he did
not have contact with any of the children in the school, which has
students in grades three through six.
   Massaro said he did not know the man was engaged in arranging
prostitution services from the building.
   ``I knew he was an escort, but I didn't know he was running an
escort service,'' he told the Times. ``I couldn't condone it from
going out of here (the school) ... He may have done that, but I did
not know that.''
   The prostitute told the newspaper that the principal ``was very
aware of what I was doing and what was going on.''
   He also said that on at least one occasion he performed a
homosexual act with a client in the guidance counselor's office. The
prostitute said Massaro did not know ``that I had met a client at
the school.''
   ``There were some afternoons where he just had nowhere to go, so
I would just let him come here to the school and just use the
bathroom and stuff like that,'' Massaro told the Times.
   The principal said he ended his relationship with the call-boy
after the call-boy had misused his credit card.
   ``I just used very poor judgment. What can I tell you,'' Massaro
told the Times. ``It was just stupid. I never thought it through. I
just thought I was helping somebody.''
   In an interview with a Washington television station, WUSA, Gobie
said ``categorically'' that no children were ever involved in any of
his activities at the school.
   He admitted he has been convicted on felony sex and drug charges
in Virginia, and said he went public on the relationship with
Massaro and Frank because he wants to sell his story to the
entertainment industry.
   People living around the school and Massaro's neighbors in
Rockville, another nearby Maryland community, said nothing at the
school or in the principal's behavior offered a clue as to what had
been going on.
   None of them wanted to be quoted by name.
   A woman who lives near Massaro said her family and his are close
friends, especially after she and Massaro both had sons die in their
late teens or early twenties.
   She said Massaro and his wife had been nearly daily visitors to
comfort the neighbor in the weeks since her son died.
   ``He's friendly, he's outgoing,'' she said.
   Across the street a man said ``He's one of the nicest people I
ever met.'' The man said he was ``flabbergasted.''
   Back near the school and a few doors down the street, a young
mother said her family had just moved into the neighborhood and her
kids were to start attending the school this fall.
   She sent her kids out into the yard to blow bubbles, while she
stood inside the door and read the story in the newspaper provided
by a reporter.
   Then she rolled her eyes and said ``It's just our luck.''

<HEAD>Mayor Says Americans Must Stop Making Movies in Paris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans can't make any more movies in Paris until
French director Elie Chouraqui is allowed to shoot his film in
Chicago and Kansas, Mayor Jacques Chirac said Friday.
   Chirac's order threatened ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' starring Paul
Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward and directed by James Ivory,
which began six planned days of shooting Friday.
   Chirac said he would ``suspend all authorizations for American
films currently shooting in Paris'' until Chouraqui and his crew
were given visas to start work on his film ``Miss Missouri.''
   Culture Minister Jack Lang said he found the U.S. treatment of
Chouraqui ``humiliating and unacceptable,'' but did not support
blocking U.S. films being made in France because of assurances from
American movie industry officials that the situation would be
cleared up immediately.
   Both Chirac and Lang said in their statements they had been
trying to get action from U.S. officials since Monday, when
Chouraqui had planned to begin work, but there apparently was
opposition from the Directors Guild of America.
   Lang's office issued the text of a message it said he received
from Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, saying Chouraqui would have his visa ``this weekend or
Monday at the latest.''
   The message said officials of the directors' guild had agreed to
end their opposition to a visa for Chouraqui and immigration
officials had promised quick action.
   A spokesman for the Ivory production said privately: ``The
situation has been resolved. Once people who knew what they were
doing got involved the whole thing was cleared up. We're totally
behind France and France is totally behind us.''
   Chouraqui is known in France for such films as ``Paroles et
Musique'' (Words and Music) and ``Qu'est-ce Qui Fait Courir David?''
(What Makes David Run?).

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Friday
he will seek increased American aid for reconstruction in
earthquake-damaged Soviet Armenia.
   According to a statement released by his Washington office, Dole,
R-Kan., made the pledge in Poland after he and his wife, Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, toured the damaged areas in Armenia and
delivered $50,000 worth of relief supplies. The supplies were
gathered by Project Hope, a private U.S. relief agency.
   The U.S. government has provided $4 million worth of assistance,
most of it in transportation, since the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake
that killed 25,000 people. Americans have given another $160 million
privately, Dole said.
   ``If anybody wants to look at a place where they could use help _
whether they're children, whether they're schools, whether they're
homes _ here's a little country of 3.3 million people with 700,000
homeless,'' he said.
   Dole said he will deliver to President Bush a letter from U.S.
relief organizations outlining their needs in Armenia.

<HEAD>Strike To Protest Crime Wave Shuts Down French Guiana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAYENNE, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses, public transport and
government offices were shut down Friday in a 24-hour strike to
protest a crime wave attributed to immigrants from neighboring South
American nations.
   The strike, called by the Chamber of Commerce and backed by
businesses and trade unions, paralyzed Cayenne, the capital; Kourou,
site of the European space station, and St. Laurent, on the western
border with Suriname.
   The Chamber of Commerce closed Rochambeau International Airport,
which it manages, but police occupied it Friday and forced it to
open.
   Chamber of Commerce President Pierre Prevot said the strike was
called to protest ``a surge in burglaries, crimes of all sort,
usually committed with violence, and street attacks in broad
daylight.''
   Police blamed most of the crime on foreign immigrants, especially
from neighboring Guyana and Suriname.
   In recent weeks a Cayenne accountant for a forestry company was
killed and robbed of $47,000 in workers' salaries he was carrying,
jewelry boutiques and food stores in the three main towns were
robbed, and burglars broke into dozens of private homes.
   French Guiana is a French overseas department, or state, on the
northeast shoulder of South America.
   About 40 percent of its 100,000 residents are foreigners, mostly
Haitian, Surinamese, Brazilians or Guyanese.
   Prevot said residents demanding the government give ``more
material for police and gendarmes to help them better control
foreign workers.''
   He said in a statement that if authorities fail to act,
``citizens will create militias to patrol towns and protect
ourselves.''
   Immigrants and illegal aliens have flocked here in recent years
to work in the lumber industry and raising shrimp, or, in the case
of an estimated 10,000 Surinamese, to escape army repression.
   The only prison in Cayenne, a town of 45,000, is filled with
inmates, mostly from Guyana and Suriname.
   ``We propose to help finance the construction of a new prison in
Cayenne, because the only existing one is overcrowded,'' Prevot said.

<HEAD>New Cambodia Proposal Being Prepared; Conference Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several nations were drawing up a new power-sharing
proposal Friday in hopes of breaking a deadlock at the international
conference on Cambodia, but there was no sign of agreement among
Cambodian factions.
   Secretary of State James Baker will not participate in next
week's three-day closing session, the State Department said, and it
was not clear how many other foreign ministers from the 19 countries
attending would be there.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington
that ``a comprehensive settlement is not in sight'' after a month of
meetings because Vietnam and the Cambodian government it sponsors
had not shown flexibility.
   ``The gap on major issues remains rather substantial,'' a Western
delegate said privately. ``It does not appear likely the conference
will achieve its objectives.''
   It was called to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive
settlement of the civil war in Cambodia, which began when Vietnam
invaded in December 1978 and ousted Pol Pot's genocidal Khmer Rouge
government. Vietnam says all its forces will be withdrawn next month.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest faction in the guerrilla
alliance led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former ruler of
Cambodia, and he insists on a role for it. China supports the Khmer
Rouge.
   When he arrived in Paris on Friday, Hun Sen said: ``There will be
no comprehensive settlement without the elimination of the Khmer
Rouge.'' He said the government in Phnom Penh ``cannot sacrifice the
vital interests of the Cambodian people to satisfy other countries.''
   Sihanouk had proposed that a government of the three rebel
factions and Hun Sen run the country until general elections. He has
refused any power-sharing arrangement between himself and Hun Sen to
the exclusion of the others, and rejected a French compromise this
week.
   A source in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said the
six member nations consulted with other delegations Friday on the
outline of a new compromise. He would not elaborate, but said it
represented ``one last good-faith effort.''
   The ASEAN members are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   In its first concrete action, the conference sent a U.N.
fact-finding mission to Cambodia to gather information for the
dispatch of a force to monitor the Vietnamese withdrawal and oversee
an eventual cease-fire.
   Hun Sen's government objects to a role for the United Nations as
long as it continues to recognize Sihanouk's coalition as the
Cambodian representative.
   On Wednesday, the U.N. mission gave the conference a six-page
report recommending self-sufficiency for a monitoring force.
   ``They don't try to give the impression it would be an easy
operation,'' a Western delegate said.

<HEAD>Report Namibian Guerrillas Detained Leaders' Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Namibian guerrilla officials
were so worried about infiltration by spies that they once detained
the wife of their leader, a newspaper sympathetic to their cause
reported Friday.
   The Weekly Mail, a respected anti-apartheid newspaper based in
Johannesburg, said in a front-page story that Kowambo Nujoma, wife
of the guerrilla movement's president Sam Nujoma, was detained in
1986 for an unspecified period on suspicion of being a South African
spy.
   It said she now is free and is believed to have been reconciled
with her husband's South-West Africa People's Organization.
   The movement waged a 23-year bush war against South African rule
of Namibia before agreeing to a truce as part of the ongoing
U.N.-sponsored transition to independence.
   It is expected to win November independence elections but has
come under mounting criticism for its treatment of dissidents and
suspected spies during the war.
   Asked about The Weekly Mail report, guerrilla official Nahas
Angula said in Windhoek, Namibia, that he could not comment without
checking with the movement's headquarters in Luanda, Angola. Jesaya
Nyamu, a guerrilla spokesman in Luanda, declined to comment.
   Angula said he believed Mrs. Nujoma is in Luanda.
   Theo-Ben Gurirab, the movement's foreign affairs secretary,
confirmed at a news conference Wednesday that the guerrillas had
tortured some political prisoners.
   He also invited officials of international human rights
organizations to inspect camps in Angola to verify the guerrillas'
claim that all their prisoners have been freed. In the past, the
movement refused to allow inspections.
   On Thursday, officials of the U.N. monitoring force in Namibia
said they may inspect the camps.
   The Weekly Mail, quoting freed dissidents who have returned to
Namibia, said there had been an atmosphere of ``absurd paranoia and
spy obsession'' within the movement.
   ``Persistent, detailed claims of torture and atrocities made by
237 former detainees ... have led even longstanding allies of the
organization to rebuke SWAPO and demand a full inquiry into the
treatment of suspected spies,'' said the newspaper.
   The ``wave of terror,'' it said, resulted partly from resentment
by poorly educated security officials against members of the
movement who had received university education abroad.
   The Weekly Mail quoted a former detainee as saying Mrs. Nujoma's
sister, Hilma Mushimba, had been forced to say during interrogation
in 1986 that her sister was a South African agent. The newspaper
said Mrs. Nujoma subsequently was detained, but it was not known for
how long.
   South African government officials frequently say the newspaper
is biased in favor of black opposition groups. Since its founding in
1985, the newspaper has carried numerous reports from Namibia
critical of South African policies in the territory and conveying
the positions of the territory's guerrilla movement.

<HEAD>A Living Earth's Responses Could Worsen Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many studies predicting manmade global
warming fail to consider that the Earth could heat things up more by
responding with its own climate-shifting effects, scientists at a
U.S.-Soviet conference said Friday.
   Until now, scientists have predicted global warming would be
based largely on the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other
atmospheric gases produced by human activities, such as the burning
of fossil fuels and logging of forests.
   Many say that such warming, left unchecked, could drastically
alter worldwide weather patterns and increase polar-ice melting,
thereby raising the sea level and flooding coastal regions.
   That's bad enough, but when natural responses to warming are
considered, the situation looks even grimmer, said Daniel Lashof, a
former Environmental Protection Agency scientist now working for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
   ``All the models are modeling a dead Earth,'' Lashof said. ``When
you look at a live Earth, you get a different answer.''
   Researchers are just starting to study how global warming may
kill off forests and prompt the release of methane from ocean
sediments, events that in turn could heat up the Earth even more.
   Lashof predicted that these responses and other natural
``feedback'' could as much as double the amount of global warming,
already forecast by current studies to range from 2 to 10 degrees
over the next century.
   His predictions were supported by others at the conference on
global warming concluding this weekend at actor-filmmaker Robert
Redford's Sundance resort in central Utah.
   Studies supporting Lashof's conclusions ``are accumulating on an
almost day-by-day basis,'' said George Woodwell, director of the
Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts.
   ``If the biotic effects that appear to be materializing are real,
they have the potential for speeding the process of warming
appreciably,'' Woodwell said.
   Global warming theories hinge on the ``greenhouse effect,'' in
which certain gases in the atmosphere block incoming solar heat from
escaping back out to space.
   Those gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, have always been
present and are kept in equilibrium by natural processes. The oceans
absorb carbon dioxide, for example, as do trees, which store carbon
in trunks, branches and roots.
   But industrial societies are pumping carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere at much-elevated rates, as well as adding new
``greenhouse gases'' such as chlorofluorocarbons.
   Research has so far concentrated on measuring and then reducing
these manmade gases, but natural processes that occur as the globe
heats up are important as well.
   An example: Rising temperatures could destroy entire forests, as
it gets too hot for tree species adapted to the local climate. ``The
growth rate of trees is very temperature-dependent. If they get too
hot or too cold, they don't grow well,'' said Daniel Botkin, a
biology professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
   The scrub brush that follows would not store as much carbon,
Botkin said. And it would take decades for other, more
heat-resistant trees to migrate in from the south, he said.
   ``Trees may be left behind,'' he said. ``They can't keep up with
the climate change. You'd get a pulse of carbon from those forests.''
   Another natural response to global warming could involve methane
trapped in offshore ocean sediments, Lashof said. If the atmosphere
warms, so will the oceans, releasing some of that methane into the
air.
   A global warming-induced shift of forests to the north also could
heat things up further by decreasing the amount of light reflected,
Lashof said. Trees of the northern boreal forest absorb more heat
than the snowy tundra.
   But that effect could be counteracted elsewhere by greater light
reflected from the spreading of grassland and desert areas, he said.
   Lashof concedes that other natural processes may slow the rate of
global warming, not increase it.
   One recent study suggests, for example, that warming could
increase the amount of sun-blocking clouds, producing a cooling
effect.
   But Lashof, though conceding his model depends on loose estimates
for many calculations, believes the net effect of the Earth's
responses would speed global warming.
   Woodwell recommended a sharp reduction in the use of fossil fuels
as the best way to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. Stopping the
destruction of forests and planting new ones also could help, he
said.
   Lashof said all is not bleak, despite the gloomy predictions.
Humans are causing global warming, but it appears they also can stop
it _ if they act in time. ``When you take a look at the problem, you
find there is a lot you can do about it,'' Lashof said.

<HEAD>Kidnapped Gold Merchant Found; Israelis Blow up More Arab Homes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New material and editing throughout, UPDATING with details of
kidnapping, quotes from victim, other. No pickup</HEAD>

   Security agents rescued a kidnapped Israeli gold
merchant from a well on Friday, a day and a half after he was seized
by masked Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
   Shaul Mishaniya was found after a huge search by helicopters and
hundreds of soldiers. Officials said an Arab suspect captured
Thursday led agents of the Shin Bet secret service to the well in
the tiny village of Abush near Tukarem. Israel TV said three alleged
kidnappers are in custody.
   Army officials said the well was about 20 to 23 feet deep, but
that Mishaniya's head was above water.
   ``I am healthy, thank God, and thank you to the Israeli army and
all the soldiers who helped me,'' Mishaniya said on Israel radio.
   Mishaniya, 47, was the first Israeli civilian abducted in the
20-month-old Palestinian uprising, stirring speculation that leaders
of the revolt were stepping up the violence in their battle against
Israeli occupation.
   Israel television said security officials suspected Mishaniya's
kidnapping was part of a hostage-bargaining operation.
   It said Shin Bet apprehended one suspect hours after the
kidnapping and described him as a wanted member of an underground
Palestinian group in Abush.
   However, officials also said they were investigating possible
criminal motives for the kidnapping.
   ``The motive is not known. The investigation is looking into
whether it is political or criminal or both,'' said Col. Renaan
Gissin, deputy military spokesman.
   Few Israelis now venture to the West Bank because of the
uprising. Mishaniya reportedly there went to collect debts owed him
by Arabs. News reports said he argued with an Arab merchant before
he was grabbed Wednesday night by masked men carrying knives.
   Mishaniya said on TV he was inside an Arab-owned taxi ``when
several youths came running. One sat next to me on the front seat,
holding a big screwdriver in his hand.''
   He said the abductors blinfolded him and led him to hills where
they walked for about three hours. The men ``tried to put me on a
donkey, saying: `You are an old man, it's not worth walking,' but
... I thought they wanted me to fall down and die.''
   Mishaniya said the kidnappers then drove him blindfolded in a car
and finally put him in the well.
   At least 548 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers or
Israeli civilians during the uprising, which began in December 1987
in lands taken by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
Wast war. Fellow Arabs killed 97 others as collaborators.
Thirty-eight Israelis also died in the violence.
   In the Gaza Strip on Friday, the army demolished three houses and
partly destroyed a fourth of Palestinians accused of killing alleged
collaborators or playing a role in the uprising, the army said.
   The army has torn down more than 200 houses in the occupied lands
during the uprising, despite complaints by the United State and
human rights groups that destroying homes amounts to collective
punishment.
   The Jerusalem Post quoted army sources as saying a Palestinian
teen-ager whose body was found Tuesday in a West Bank refugee camp
was killed by Israeli security forces the night before. An army
spokeswoman could not confirm the report.
   Also Friday, the army permanently barred Palestinian writer
Mutawakil Taha from entering Israel, an army spokesman said.
   Taha, head of the West Bank Writers Association, has been
repeatedly accused of fostering the uprising.

<HEAD>DEA Agent, Brother Plead Innocent to Drug Trafficking Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal drug agent and his brother pleaded
innocent to cocaine trafficking charges Friday, and a U.S.
magistrate said she would decide Monday whether either man should be
freed on bail.
   Prosecutor Thomas Burrows asked U.S. Magistrate Patti Saris to
hold Edward O'Brien and his brother John without bail.
   Defense lawyers recommended that Edward O'Brien be released with
an electronic bracelet that would let authorities check his
whereabouts and that John O'Brien be freed on bail.
   ``I do believe there is a serious risk of flight,'' Saris said,
but added that she was intrigued by the bracelet idea.
   Edward O'Brien, who formerly ran the DEA office in Springfield,
and John O'Brien were each indicted Thursday on five counts of
cocaine trafficking. Edward O'Brien, 44, has been placed on
administrative leave pending the outcome of his case.
   O'Brien, a former expert in government ``sting'' operations, was
arrested by undercover officers Aug. 14 at Boston's Logan
International Airport while allegedly delivering suitcases filled
with 62 pounds of cocaine.
   The 18-year DEA veteran said in an alleged confession presented
Thursday in court that he was paid to ferry drugs from Florida to
Boston.
   On Friday, the defense accused the government of creating the
case against the O'Briens.
   ``It's the government that decided how much drugs to give him.
It's a government-manufactured case. They attempted to present a
case where they can ask for him not to be released under any
conditions,'' said Susan L. Crockin, an attorney for Edward O'Brien.
   Richard Cohen, John O'Brien's attorney, said his client is a
family man and a businessman with $100,000 in equity put up by his
brother and his girlfriend.

<HEAD>Abu Nidal Group Says It Will Avenge Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian terrorist group said in a
statement published Friday it will kill 15 spies to avenge the
assassination of one of its senior leaders.
   The statement from the Fatah-Revolutionary Council of master
terrorist Abu Nidal did not divulge the names or nationalities of
the alleged spies or set a deadline for their killing.
   ``The movement will execute the death sentence against 15 spies
belonging to several groups involved in this crime,'' said the
statement published by several Beirut newspapers.
   The statement identified the dead man as Abdul-Rahim Riyahi. He
was shot Wednesday at the entrance to the southern port city of
Sidon.
   Police said Riyahi was driving from Beirut with his bodyguards
when gunmen in a black Mercedes raked his car with machine-gun fire.
One bodyguard, Hisham Saeed, 28, was seriously wounded.
   No group claimed responsibility for the assassination.
   Abu Nidal long has been at odds with Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat, who has re-established a major
power base in Sidon's refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh.
The Fatah-Revolutionary Council also has strongholds in the two
camps.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is wanted by the
U.S. and West European government for scores of terrorist attacks,
including the 1985 attacks at Rome and Vienna airports.

<TEXT>
   A Denver police officer who turned up in Utah after
a week-long manhunt told investigators Friday his financial and
personal problems compelled him to abandon his patrol car and head
west on a motorcycle.
   David Hayhurst, 39, who had gotten a new apartment and a job at
an auto-body shop in Reno, Nev., said he decided to return home
after reading a newspaper account of the manhunt and deciding ``I
couldn't do this to all those good people in Denver.''
   ``I just took off. I'm just sorry that I did it,'' he told
KMGH-TV while en route to Denver, escorted by two police detectives.
``I should have got some help somewhere. I didn't know where else to
turn.''
   Hayhurst was in uniform when he phoned authorities and his family
Thursday night from a convenience store in Salt Lake City.
   Hayhurst's abandoned patrol car was found in southwest Denver
early Aug. 18, its motor running, lights on and driver's door open.
Investigators initially theorized that the 17-year veteran had been
kidnapped following a routine traffic stop.
   At a news conference Friday, Denver Police Chief Ari Zavaras said
Hayhurst cited personal and financial pressures in admitting he
walked away from the patrol car, hopped on a motorcycle and left
Denver, planning never to return.
   ``He ... said he was under such pressure that he just couldn't
handle it anymore,'' Zavaras said.
   Zavaras said he has placed Hayhurst on paid administrative leave
and ordered him to undergo psychological and physical examinations.
He said Hayhurst could be reprimanded or fired after the tests.
Hayhurst said he hoped to remain on the force.
   After arriving in Denver Friday morning, Hayhurst met with his
family for half an hour at police headquarters and with Zavaras
before being taken to Denver General Hospital.
   ``I would not classify myself as angry _ I guess I am
disappointed,'' Zavaras said. ``He has put his family, his police
department _ he has put this city _ through some real turmoil.''

<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. announced Friday that Alvah
Chapman will step down as chairman of the board effective Oct. 1,
and will be replaced by Chief Executive Officer James K. Batten.
   Chapman, 68, who has headed the board since 1982, will continue
as chairman of the company's executive committee and a member of the
board, and will also serve as a consultant.
   ``I have honored my commitment to the board and CEO Jim Batten
when I delayed my retirement at their request almost 18 months
beyond our mandatory retirement age,'' Chapman said.
   Batten, 53, who also is a board member of The Associated Press,
will continue as chief executive officer when he assumes the
chairmanship, the company said.
   Batten, a native of Suffolk, Va., began his career as editor of
the newspaper at Davidson College. He was a reporter for The
Charlotte Observer in North Carolina, then worked in Knight-Ridder's
Washington bureau.
   Starting in 1970, he served in editorial positions at the Detroit
Free Press and The Charlotte Observer and moved to vice
president-news for Knight-Ridder in 1975.
   P. Anthony Ridder, 48, will succeed Batten as president and
continue as president of Knight-Ridder's newspaper division.
   ``I will do all in my power to make sure Knight-Ridder is forever
synonymous with the best in newspaper publishing and business and
professional information,'' Ridder said.
   The company announced last month that Richard G. Capen Jr.,
publisher of The Miami Herald, will become vice chairman of
Knight-Ridder on Sept. 1. The company previously announced that
David Lawrence Jr., who has been publisher at the Detroit Free
Press, would become Herald publisher.
   Chapman served as Knight-Ridder's chief executive officer from
1976 until 1988, when Batten assumed the position. He graduated from
The Citadel in 1942 with a bachelor of science degree in business
administration, and served in World War II as a bomber pilot.
   He joined the staff of the Columbus (Ga.) Ledger-Enquirer after
the war, later becoming executive vice president and general manager
of the St. Petersburg Times in 1953.
   He became part owner, president and publisher of the Savannah
(Ga.) Morning News and Evening Press in 1957. He joined the Knight
organization in 1960, moving up to vice president and general
manager of the Herald, becoming president in 1969.
   He was named president of Knight Newspapers in 1973, and was the
first president of Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc. at the time of the
merger in 1974. Knight-Ridder currently owns 29 daily newspapers,
and is completing the sale of its eight broadcast stations. The
company also has investments in cable television and in business
information services, including Dialog.

<HEAD>Army Captain Sentenced In Burning Of Dissidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military judge sentenced army Capt.
Pedro Fernandez to 300 days in prison for the burning of two young
dissidents _ one fatally _ during an anti-government protest, but
Fernandez will not go to jail.
   In handing down the sentence Thursday night, the judge, army Gen.
Carlos Parera, said Fernandez could show up in court every week for
one year and sign a control book instead of actually being
incarcerated.
   The procedure, called remission of sentence, is frequent in
Chilean courts.
   The victims' lawyers said they will appeal the sentence.
   Fernandez commanded an army patrol quelling widespread street
protests against the military government on July 2, 1986, when
Rodrigo Rojas, 18, a Chilean photographer living in Washington,
D.C., and Carmen Gloria Quintana, a 19-year-old university student,
were severely burned.
   Rojas died four days later. Ms. Quintana survived after lengthy
treatment in Chile and in Canada.
   Ms. Quintana and at least two witnesses charged that soldiers
doused Rojas and her with gasoline and then set them on fire.
   Fernandez said the two were burned accidentally when a pot of
gasoline they were carrying ignited. He said they intended to set
street barricades on fire.
   Parera basically accepted Fernandez's account, but ruled he was
negligent in abandoning the two teen-agers instead of taking them to
a hospital.
   Luis Toro and Hector Salazar, the lawyers for the victims, said
Fernandez was guilty of the more serious crime of ``unnecessary
violence resulting in death and serious injury.''

   Summer vacationers donned overcoats in the Northeast and snow
fell in Montana on Friday, while the deep South experienced
uncomfortable summer heat.
   Fall weather made an early appearance as temperatures fell to as
low as 29 degrees at East Haven, Vt. Warm coats were needed atop of
Mount Washington, N.H., where temperatures were around 30 degrees
and winds gusted over 60 mph.
   Scattered frost is expected Saturday morning in the colder
valleys of northern New England and northeastern New York state.
   Cold weather also the rule across the northern and central
Rockies, with temperatures in the 50s and 60s.
   Heavy rain since Wednesday has caused flooding in parts of
northwest Montana, where more than 2{ inches rain fell from noon
Thursday to noon Friday at Great Falls.
   Heavy snow covered some mountain ranges in Montana. The Beartooth
Highway southwest of Red Lodge was covered with 1 to 2 inches of
snow Friday morning.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered from eastern
portions of the northern and central Plains across Arkansas and the
Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Widespread thunderstorms drenched northern Florida. A
thunderstorm doused Daytona Beach with almost an inch of rain in a
half-hour.
   A warm front extended from southern Missouri across northern
Kentucky to the Carolinas, separating cloudy and cool weather in the
North from hot weather in the South.
   Temperatures as high as the mid-90s and high humidity made things
uncomfortable from south-central Texas across the lower Mississippi
Valley to Georgia.
   The low temperature in the lower 48 states Thursday morning was
28 degrees at Gunnison, Colo. At 3 p.m. EDT, the low was 47 degrees
at Yellowstone Park in Wyoming and the high 100 degrees at
Montgomery, Ala.
   Saturday's national forecast called for showers and thunderstorms
over the upper half of the Mississippi Valley, the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys and Florida; and widely scattered thunderstorms
over the northern Rockies, much of the Plains and the central Gulf
Coast.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s in northern Maine, western
Montana and along parts of the Pacific Coast; in the 90s in the
southern Atlantic Coast, the Gulf Coast, the lower Mississippi
Valley, the southern Plains and interior valleys of California; near
100 in the desert Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s elsewhere.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu chose a woman to
replace a Cabinet minister who resigned Friday in the second sex
scandal of a disastrous year for the governing party.
   The appointment of Mayumi Moriyama, 61, as chief Cabinet
secretary was seen as an attempt to limit the damage caused by Tokuo
Yamashita's resignation from a government formed just 16 days
earlier to cleanse the party's scandal-ridden image.
   Mrs. Moriyama is the first woman to be chief Cabinet secretary,
and it is the highest government post ever held by a woman in this
male-dominated society. She formerly was director of the Environment
Agency, also a Cabinet position.
   The chief secretary presides over twice-weekly Cabinet meetings,
speaks for the government and coordinates policy discussions among
ministries.
   Yamashita, 69, stepped down after acknowledging a three-year
affair with a bar hostess nearly 45 years his junior.
   He became the sixth Cabinet member, including Prime Ministers
Noboru Takeshita and Sousuke Uno, to resign in less than a year
because of an influence-peddling scandal, publicity over illicit
sexual liaisons and an election defeat.
   A major factor in the election loss last month, which cost the
Liberal Democrats their majority in Parliament's upper house, was
outrage by housewives at a 3 percent sales tax the party forced
through Parliament last fall.
   ``Mrs. Moriyama has experience as a housewife as well as a
bureaucrat, and can see things from a consumer's standpoint,'' Kaifu
said in announcing the appointment. ``She will be able to include
the people's perspective in policy discussions.''
   Takako Doi, the popular woman leader of the newly vigorous
Socialist Party, has been the main beneficiary of the public
discontent with the governing party. The selection of Mrs. Moriyama
was seen as a way to counter Ms. Doi's impact.
   ``I am completely speechless,'' Ms. Doi said of Mrs. Moriyama's
appointment. ``I wonder what he thinks women are. It is a reflection
of a lack of responsibility of the LDP.''
   Ms. Doi's party was the big winner in the upper house against the
conservative Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan since the
party was formed in 1955.
   Kaifu became prime minister Aug. 9, when Uno resigned after 69
days in office to take responsibility for the election defeat. Uno
also was pursued by allegations that he kept paid mistresses.
   Yamashita told a news conference Friday: ``The Kaifu
administration had placed cleaning up politics at the head of its
agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the people. In the
end I have decided that I must resign.''
   He said he had apologized to his wife, Kyoko, and she had
forgiven him.
   Mrs. Moriyama, a former bureaucrat in the Labor Ministry, was
elected to the upper house in 1980. Kaifu chose her for the
Environment Agency, her first Cabinet post, when he formed his
government.
   Asked whether she expected problems, she told reporters, ``I was
just appointed and I can't really tell what it is going to be like.
But as far as my near 40-year professional experience is concerned,
I never felt any handicaps from being a woman.''
   Setsu Shiga, former deputy to the chief Cabinet secretary, was
named to replace her in the environment post.
   On Friday, he acknowledged receiving $21,100 in political
donations from Recruit Co., the publishing conglomerate at the
center of the influence-buying scandal that caused Takeshita to
resign June 2.
   ``I have many financially sound companies who support me,'' Shiga
said. ``Recruit back then was regarded as a very financially healthy
and growing company. I've done nothing wrong.''
   Analysts said Yamashita's resignation would undermine Kaifu's
leadership as he tries to rescue the reputations of the government
and party.
   ``The sex scandal ... will be particularly damaging,'' said
political analyst Masaya Ito. ``The clean and progressive image was
said to be the only strength for the Kaifu administration, which
lacks a strong power base within the party.''
   Commentator Soichiro Tawara said of Mrs. Moriyama: ``The
appointment is apparently aimed at bettering the image of the
government. ... She may be helpful in some ways, but I am not
confident that a politician with such limited experience can handle
perhaps the most demanding position in the Cabinet.''

   Soccer fans at Athens Olympic Stadium
attacked each other Friday night, then united against police who
tried to stop the melee. Police said 45 people were injured,
including 14 officers.
   A police spokesman said fans ripped out thousands of the
stadium's plastic seats and hurled them at each other or at officers.
   Fighting began late in a match between AEK of Athens and
Olympiakos of Piraeus, the top teams of last season, when they were
tied 2-2. Small scuffles had broken out each time a team scored.
   When the major battle began, the game was stopped and police
tried to disperse the belligerents with tear gas.
   The crowd turned on police and the violence spilled out of the
stadium. Two police motorcycles and nearly a dozen cars were
destroyed.
   Two policemen were hospitalized, but all others injured were
treated and released, according to the police spokesman. He said the
battle lasted about 1{ hours and no arrests were made.

   A group of 12 Soviet Jews said Friday they are
fasting in front of the U.S. Embassy to protest being denied visas
to go to the United States.
   The U.S. government used to accept almost all Soviet Jews who
applied for immigration, but changed its policy in October because
of the large number now permitted to leave the Soviet Union.
   ``We have just been drinking water since Monday,'' said Edward
Leitman, who has lived for seven months with his wife and daughter
in Ladispoli, north of Rome. ``This may possibly make them change
their minds.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hahn declined comment on the
protest Friday. He said recently that Soviet Jews now must
demonstrate they were persecuted for political or religious reasons
to enter the United States as refugees.
   Since October, about 4,000 applicants at the embassy in Italy
have been denied visas, he said.
   The fast is the latest protest by Soviet Jews in front of the
embassy.
   Italy is a transit point for Soviets trying to immigrate to other
Western countries. All of the Jews could immigrate to Israel, but
most are trying to get to the United States or Canada.

   Rain and darkness forced rescuers to
postpone their search Friday for a passenger plane that disappeared
over the country's rugged northern mountains with 54 people.
   The Pakistan International Airlines Fokker-27 took off early
Friday on what should have been a 45-minute flight from the
Korakoram Mountain city of Gilgit to Islamabad.
   ``The pilot of the missing plane made a routine call seven
minutes after takeoff. There was nothing after that, nothing at all
to indicate the plane was in trouble,'' said Azra Sultan, an airline
spokeswoman.
   The airline's chief pilot, who uses the single name Khizar, said
the twin-engine plane carried 49 passengers, including five infants,
and five crew members.
   Most of the passengers were Pakistanis, but Ms. Sultan said the
list included an American, Paul McGorrian, a former staff writer at
the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. McGorrian was doing
free-lance work in Pakistan for the Times and other newspapers.
   Two Pakistan Air Force C-130 aircraft, helicopters and a small
airline search plane scanned the Himalaya and Korakoram mountains
for signs of the plane until darkness and bad weather forced them to
wait until Saturday.
   ``We are still hopeful. We haven't found anything yet,'' Ms.
Sultan said.
   Also looking out for the plane were Indian aviation authorities
and the U.N.'s Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan, posted
in the disputed state of Jammu-Kashmir.
   Airline officials said the last they saw the propeller plane was
when it took off at 7:36 a.m. from Gilgit for the Pakistani capital
of Islamabad, 175 miles to the south.
   Gilgit Airport said weather at the time was partly cloudy.
Thunderstorms and heavy rain lashed Islamabad later in the morning.

<HEAD>Court Charges 13 People with Contempt in Toxic Waste Scandal</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BAIE-COMEAU, Canada (AP) _ Thirteen people, including the captain
of a Soviet freighter, were charged with contempt of court Friday
for the dumping of 15 containers of toxic waste barred by a court
injunction.
   The cargo remained on the government wharf of this St. Lawrence
seaport Friday, blocking shipments and an adjacent ferry. It was
unloaded there before dawn Thursday by the Soviet freighter Nadezhda
Obukhova, which then steamed out of the harbor.
   Judge Paul Corriveau of Quebec Superior Court charged four
officials from Dynamis Envirotech, the Montreal company hired to
dispose of the waste; a vice-president of the public utility
Hydro-Quebec, which was to store the waste; six truck drivers hired
to move it to a storage depot; a man, apparently Canadian,
identified only as Gaeten Halle; and the freighter captain, who was
not identified by name.
   They must appear before Corriveau on Sept. 28. Offenders can be
fined up to $5,000 and a year in jail.
   The cargo of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, was shipped from
Montreal to Liverpool, in Britain, where it was turned away by dock
owners and workers after protests from environmentalists.
   The Soviet freighter then returned to Canada with the cargo,
which was to be stored temporarily at a facility near Baie-Comeau
while authorities considered other ways to get rid of the poisonous
chemical, which usually is incinerated at very high heat.
   Baie-Comeau community groups won a court injunction early
Thursday forbidding the unloading of the cargo.
   Court documents say the captain was served with the injunction,
but the ship slipped its moorings and set sail without the
containers.
   The cargo is part of 1,500 tons of noxious waste that the Quebec
government contracted Dynamis Envirotech to dispose of for $7.9
million.
   Polychlorinated biphenyls were used primarily as a coolant in
electrical transformers but have been banned in North America
because of links to cancer. They cause skin diseases and are toxic
to a variety of animals, especially fish, and may affect animal
reproduction.

<TEXT>
   A convicted rapist freed on bail while
awaiting trial in another rape case has been charged with murdering
a bank executive who apparently was kidnapped on her lunch hour and
shot in a city park.
   Daniel J. Webb, 27, was ordered held on $1.6 million bond Friday
in the death of Diane Gellenbeck, 37, of Newington, a vice president
at Connecticut National Bank.
   Ms. Gellenbeck was last seen alive when she left for her lunch
break Thursday. At about 1 p.m., police checking reports of gunshots
found her bullet-riddled body, fully clothed except for shoes, near
the golf course in Keney Park. Police were awaiting test results to
see if she had been raped.
   A spokesman for the bank said Ms. Gellenbeck was single and had
worked for the bank for 16 years.
   Webb turned himself in at Hartford police headquarters about four
hours later, after police surrounded his Bloomfield home.
   The attack in the park was similar to the 1984 kidnap and rape
that landed Webb in prison. He was convicted of abducting a woman
from the Hartford Civic Center parking garage, taking her to Keney
Park and raping her.
   Police have not confirmed that Ms. Gellenbeck was kidnapped
Thursday, but two legal sources said she was kidnapped at the Civic
Center garage before she was taken to the park.
   ``Based on her (appointments) calendar, there was no reason for
her to be in the park at that time,'' said Hartford police Lt.
Frederick Lewis. The large public park is about two miles from
Gellenbeck's downtown office.
   Asked if Webb was known to Hartford police, Lewis sighed and
said, ``notoriously.''
   Hartford State's Attorney John Bailey said Webb has been arrested
several times since his release from prison, believed to be in 1986,
each time on charges of sexual assault or robbery. But prosecutors
have been unable to keep him behind bars as he awaits trial.
   After being freed from prison and put on probation for his 1984
conviction, Webb was arrested and jailed again in June 1988 on
charges he forced a woman's car off of a highway in New Britain,
then kidnapped her and raped her. But in June of this year, Webb,
still awaiting trial, was released when he put up his father's
storefront church as a $200,000 property bond.
   Webb was arrested again July 29 on charges of robbery and larceny
in East Hartford, but again he made bond. Prosecutors went to court
as recently as Monday seeking to have the bond increased, but a
judge put off a ruling because Webb's lawyer was out of town.
   ``This has been a very frustrating case for the state,'' Bailey
said. ``We have done everything we could under the current law to
keep him incarcerated.''
   Bailey complained that state laws prevent pretrial detention for
suspects believed to be dangerous, and prevent judges from
considering how dangerous an accused criminal is when they set bond.
   Bond is set based on whether a judge believes the accused will
show up for trial, and no one is held without bond, Bailey said.
   ``We've been arguing for five years for preventive detention _ no
bail _ if the guy is dangerous,'' Bailey said.
   Superior Court Judge Andre Kocay set Webb's current bond so high,
Bailey said, because the number of charges against him increased the
likelihood that he would not show up for trial.

   A woman who at one time claimed to be David
Letterman's wife was sent to prison Friday after police said she
trespassed at the talk show host's Connecticut home for the fifth
time in the past year.
   Margaret Ray, 37, was arrested Thursday after being caught by the
talk show host at his home in New Canaan.
   Superior Court Judge Harold Dean ruled that Ray had violated
terms of her probation by reappearing at the home outside New York
City. He ordered her to spend nine months at Niantic Women's Prison
in eastern Connecticut.
   Letterman declined to press charges after notifying police
Thursday he had seen Ray walking on the grounds of his home, said
Assistant State's Attorney Robert Hall. But prosecutors pressed the
case, noting her appearance violated the terms of her probation,
Hall said.
   Ray of Paonia, Colo., was on probation for earlier break-ins to
Letterman's home. She was arrested at the New Canaan railroad
station about 4 p.m. Thursday, said police Sgt. Frank Basso.
   Ray, who was previously arrested in May 1988 and February of this
year in connection with break-ins at the comedian's home, pleaded
guilty May 30 to using Letterman's car without his permission and to
two counts of first-degree criminal trespass. As part of a plea
bargain, other charges including burglary and larceny were dropped.
   Norwalk Superior Court Judge William F. Hickey Jr. gave her a
one-year suspended sentence and three years probation, ordering her
to stay away from Letterman and continue to undergo psychiatric
treatment.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in April, Ray described
Letterman as ``the dominant figure in my life,'' and apologized for
breaking into his home.
   In May 1988, Ray was arrested when she tried to pass herself off
as Letterman's wife after she was stopped at the Lincoln Tunnel
between New Jersey and New York City driving Letterman's sports car.
Police said she told a toll collector she was married to Letterman
and the small child with her was their son.
   Police said they later discovered that someone had broken into
the comedian's home and apparently lived there for several days
while he was out of town.
   Letterman originally declined to press charges, but Ray was then
arrested a few days later at his home. She was placed on probation
in September and underwent psychiatric treatment.
   She was arrested again twice in February in connection with
break-ins at Letterman's home Feb. 24 and Feb. 28.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou on Friday
refused to testify before a parliamentary committee looking into his
alleged involvement in a major financial scandal that led to his
fall from power.
   Instead, Papandreou sent a note questioning the committee's
legality.
   Parliament voted in July to authorize investigation of
Panpandreou and four of his former ministers in the $210 million
Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement lost national
elections in June amid allegations that he and former ministers
authorized the activities of the bank's owner and chairman, George
Koskotas, or took bribes from him..
   A government formed by the conservative New Democracy Party and
the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress vowed a cleanup.
   Koskotas fled to the United States in November, but a Boston
magistrate ruled this week he should be extradited to Greece.
   The banker has claimed in interviews that Papandreou blackmailed
him into embezzling for the benefit of his party. Papandreou denies
it.
   In his message to the committee on Friday, Papandreou wrote: ``I
will not go into the legality of the proposal for an investigation
and the procedures of the committee, nor into the interests which
they undoubtedly serve.''
   He referred members to a memorandum he submitted last February to
an earlier commission of inquiry formed when he was premier. That
committee was disbanded prior to the elections before submitting a
report.
   Papandreou said then that he met three times with Koskotas at
Koskotas' request, but that he moved swiftly to order an
investigation into the banker's illegal activities when informed of
them.
   Papandreou and his party say the scandal has been exploited by
their political enemies.
   The committee must submit its report to Parliament by Sept. 9.
Deputies will then vote on whether Papandreou and his former
ministers will stand trial before a special court.
   Meanwhile, another parliamentary committee investigating
widespread wiretaps allegedly carried out during Papandreou's eight
years in power asked Papandreou on Friday to testify or submit a
memorandum before the month ends.
   Papandreou is also being investigated in connection with his
government's purchase of 80 U.S. and French jet fighters that the
present government claims were overpriced.

<HEAD>Hungary Increases Border Patrols to Stop East German Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian authorities stepped up border
patrols, slowing the flow of East German refugees who they
acknowledged Friday are fleeing illegally from Czechoslovakia into
Hungary to reach the West.
   In neighboring Romania, Yugoslav media reported authorities have
extended restricted border zones and decreed border guards can use
arms to stop Romanians trying to flee to Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   Hungary's admission came in an MTI state news agency report that
14 East Germans were caught illegally crossing the border from
Czechoslovakia, the only country East Germans can visit without
permission from their Communist government.
   East Germans who escaped have told Western reporters that some
risked two illegal crossings _ from Czechoslovakia and then into
Austria _ but there had been no official word before Friday.
   MTI also announced that armed workers' militiamen have joined
border patrols to stop the exodus.
   Only 85 East Germans made it to Austria overnight, compared with
hundreds each night earlier this week, said a West German diplomat
in Vienna who asked for anonymity.
   ``Restrictions have been introduced along the border to cope with
the chaotic situation there,'' said a spokesman for Hungary's border
guards.
   Hungarian officials declined to say whether they acted under
pressure from their Warsaw Pact ally, East Germany.
   MTI said 38 workers' militia squads have patrolled the border in
recent weeks, while another 244 militiamen are helping guards in
Gyoer-Sopron border region.
   In West Germany, the Bavarian state government said Friday it
opened a third reception camp for East German refugees because two
opened this summer are overwhelmed.
   Officials said they Thursday took 108 East Germans to the new
camp, near Nuremberg. The refugees had spent up to a month at the
West German Embassy in Budapest.
   About 5,000 East Germans have reached the West across the
Hungarian-Austrian border since the exodus began in the second half
of July, after Hungary began dismantling border barriers.
   Escapees arriving Thursday in Austria's easternmost Burgenland
province said police are turning back would-be refugees.
   They and Austrian sources said cars with East German license
plates no longer are allowed to enter the town of Sopron, less than
six miles from the border.
   A mass escape bid by East Germans who arrived at the border in
three buses and three taxis was thwarted Wednesday, Hungarian media
reported.
   An East German turned back in that convoy later managed to dash
to Austria and told reporters that border guards wielded truncheons
to force back people walking toward the border.
   The Austria Press Agency said Friday that 10 Romanians were among
refugees who crossed near Moerbisch on Lake Neusiedl.
   Hungary gives asylum to Romanian citizens, most of them ethnic
Hungarians, but many want to be in the West and cannot get entry
visas.
   Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency Friday quoted the Romanian
Official Gazette as saying no permanent residential settlements will
be permitted near the border, and ``protective works'' and alarm
systems are being constructed.
   The decree also gave border guards greater latitude to use
firearms to prevent ``arrested persons or those assisting them''
from escaping.

<TEXT>
   Paraguay asked Brazil on Friday to
extradite the Gustavo Stroessner, son of deposed Paraguayan dictator
Alfredo Stroessner, to face charges of extortion and other crimes.
   Geronimo Narvaez, first secretary of the Paraguayan Embassy, told
The Associated Press his country formally petitioned Brazil to turn
over the 46-year-old former air force colonel, presumed to be living
in Brasilia, Brazil's capital.
   Gustavo flew to exile in neighboring Brazil with his father after
a coup in February ended 34 years of Gen. Stroessner's dictatorial
rule.
   The new government stripped Gustavo Stroessner of his military
rank and charged him with corruption and illicit gains. Narvaez said
the government seized $100 million of the son's holdings in April
and that charges against him include extorting money from Paraguayan
casinos.
   A Paraguyan police report said Gustavo Stroessner received at
least $725,000 a month from three Asuncion bingo houses in 1985-88.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Ruy Nogueira said Brazil has not yet
received a formal extradition request. He said Brazil told Paraguay
on April 19 that the Justice Ministry had approved in principle
permanent political asylum for Gustavo Stroessner.
   An extradition request would have to be approved by the Foreign
Ministry, the Justice Ministry and the Supreme Court, Nogueira said.
   The son was once proposed as a possible successor to the elder
Stroessner as ruler of Paraguay.

placed on five years probation by Superior Court Judge Jay Hodges.
   ``Life is cheap,'' said Assistant District Attorney Ken Goldman
after the sentencing Thursday.
   Grubbs originally was charged with manslaughter, which carries a
maximum penalty of 20 years. She pleaded no contest when the
district attorney's office agreed to reduce the charge.
   An autopsy found 2-week-old David died Oct. 22, 1988, from a
heart attack caused by a cocaine overdose.
   Grubbs, a former exotic dancer, was charged after state troopers
tested the infant's bottle and found traces of cocaine in it.
   A trooper said Grubbs, a confessed cocaine user, admitted to
mixing the formula and feeding the infant earlier that evening.
   ``The infant was killed as a result of substance abuse,'' Hodges
ruled.
   David was born with cocaine in his system. The Division of Family
and Youth Services would not release the baby to Grubbs until the
drug left his system and Grubbs agreed to have him tested for the
drug twice a week.
   Trooper Investigator Steve Foster said Grubbs brought David in
twice for the test, which he passed, but she missed the third
session.
   Grubbs' 18-month-old son, Jeffrey, was also tested after his
brother's death and cocaine was found in his system.
   Goldman told Hodges that urinalysis tests for cocaine given to
Grubbs from January through June 12 found traces of cocaine residue
in her system. Goldman said that meant Grubbs was using cocaine
during the first trimester of her present pregnancy.
   She must report to jail Dec. 1. She is due to deliver her next
child Oct. 1.
   Grubbs also was ordered to complete a six to 18-month drug
treatment program after her jail term.
   In announcing the sentence, Hodges said the court is obligated to
send a message to the public that ``this kind of conduct will not be
tolerated.''
   Grubbs' attorney, Paul Canarsky of the public defenders office,
said Grubbs was herself a victim _``a passive recipient of drugs''
from her former boyfriend.
   He said the man beat Grubbs, forced her to work as a topless
dancer and supplied her with cocaine. Canarsksy said since Grubbs
left the man she has been drug free and her urinalysis tests have
come back clean. Grubbs has been free on her own recognizance since
her arrest.
   Canarsky asked Hodges to assign Grubbs to a residential treatment
program instead of jail. He said Friday that Grubbs has not decided
whether to appeal.
   In Florida Friday, a judge imposed 15 years of probation on a
cocaine-addicted mother convicted of delivering drugs to two of her
children at birth. Jennifer Johnson, 23, faced a 30-year prison
sentence on the conviction.

   Five young white men were charged Friday as
members of the gang that killed a black teen-ager in a rage against
interracial dating, and a sixth suspect was being sought, police
said.
   Police would not say if the man being sought is the person who
shot Yusef Hawkins on Wednesday. But police sources have said they
know the identity of the gunman, who was believed to be still in the
city.
   Hawkins, 16, and three friends came to a predominantly white
section of Brooklyn known as Bensonhurst on Wednesday night to try
to buy a used car.
   Among those charged Friday was Keith Mondello, 18, who police
said was the youth whose troubles with a girlfriend led to the
attack of the four blacks by up to 30 young men, many wielding
baseball bats.
   Mondello and his friends were said to be enraged that his former
girlfriend had been dating black and Hispanic men and were trying to
prevent non-whites from attending the girl's birthday party, police
said.
   However, Mondello's attorney said his client wasn't the jilted
boyfriend.
   Mondello and Steven Curreri, 18; Pasquale Raucci, 19, and Charles
Stressler, 21, were charged with assault, riot, aggravated
harassment, violation of civil rights, menacing, and possessing a
weapon, a baseball bat. Mondello and Curreri also were charged with
conspiracy.
   James Patino, 24, the fifth person arrested, was charged later
with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and violation of civil
rights, said a police spokesman, Officer Edward Feeney.
   The top charge, assault, carries a maximum penalty of five to 15
years.
   The slaying drew appeals from throughout the city for renewed
efforts to repair race relations. Memorial and protest marches were
organized for the weekend.
   Hawkins' death and the outrage over it was reminiscent of the
strife-filled mood following the Howard Beach racial attack of
December 1986, when Michael Griffith, a black, was hit by a car
while fleeing a gang of white teen-agers incensed at blacks entering
their Queens neighborhood.
   Some figures who had roles in the Howard Beach drama entered the
Bensonhurst case within hours of its unfolding. Those included
Stephen Murphy, the lawyer who won the only acquittal among the
major Howard Beach defendants, and C. Vernon Mason, who as attorney
for one of the black survivors forced appointment of a special
prosecutor.
   Murphy is Mondello's lawyer; Mason is representing Claude
Stanford, one of Hawkins' companions, who was not injured in the
attack.
   Assistant District Attorney Dale Campbell, chief of the office's
homicide bureau, headed the Bensonhurst investigation. Campbell
investigated the 1982 slaying of Willie Turks, a black transit
worker beaten to death by a crowd of whites outside a Brooklyn bagel
shop. Four suspects were convicted of manslaughter or assault.
   Murphy told reporters that Mondello was not the boyfriend jilted
by Gina Feliciano. He said Mondello conceded being at the scene and
having a bat, but maintained that Mondello was armed to protect
himself against the girl's threat that her black and Hispanic
friends would beat him up.
   Police said Miss Feliciano was cooperating with the investigation.
   Commissioner Benjamin Ward said the gang of 10 to 30 whites were
looking for blacks and Hispanics they believed were coming to the
neighborhood to attend Miss Feliciano's 18th birthday party.
   They did not know that Miss Feliciano, fearing trouble, had
called off the party. Ward said the white youths mistakenly went
after Hawkins and his friends, Stanford, 18, Troy Banner, 18, and
Luther Sylvester, 17. Sylvester is a cousin of Griffith, the Howard
Beach victim.
   David Dinkins, the only black candidate in the September mayoral
primary, said: ``It wasn't mistaken identity. It was a case of any
nigger will do.''
   Many New Yorkers ``have closed their eyes and tried to pretend
that this city is not choking with racial hatred,'' Galen Kirkland,
head of the city Civil Rights Coalition, said at a news conference.
   The New York Urban League renewed its call for appointment of a
permanent special prosecutor for bias crimes. League President
Donald L. Polk also proposed setting up ``sting operations in
neighborhoods with histories or recent incidents of racially
motivated harassment or violence.''
   Bensonhurst, a predominately Italian and Jewish neighborhood, has
been the site of other racial incidents.
   Two blacks were beaten by a gang of whites there on Christmas Day
1987. That gang allegedly yelled, ``This is our Howard Beach.''
Gravesend, the neighborhood where Willie Turks was killed, is nearby.
   The four suspects were hustled out of the precinct station Friday
in bulletproof vests because of a death threat.
   An anonymous caller had told a desk sergeant shortly before 9
a.m. that ``they were going to get those guys as soon as they left
the station,'' Inspector Richard Mayronne said.

   A plane crashed in Puerto Rico's
mountainous interior Friday, killing the pilot and three Dutch
passengers, officials said.
   A spokesman for the Isla Grande Airport control tower in San Juan
identified the pilot as Michael Wenceslaus Goes, a West German
resident of Puerto Rico and employee of the German-owned Looss
Aviation, a flying school that operates the rented plane.
   The airport spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the plane was hired by three Dutch sailors on a port call.
   The U.S. Navy identified the Dutch navy ship as the Pieter
Florisz.
   The airport spokesman said the plane crashed about a half-hour
after it took off on a sightseeing trip.
   Police say the plane crashed near Barranquitas, a small mountain
town about 20 miles southwest of San Juan.
   The names of the sailors were not immediately available.

   The disbanding and resettlement of the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels who fought Nicaragua's leftist
government for eight years will begin Sept. 6, officials announced
Friday.
   The secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
Joao Clemente Baena Soares of Brazil, and U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar agreed at a meeting Friday to begin the work
of the International Support and Verification Commission on that
date, a U.N. statement said.
   Perez de Cuellar also met with Miguel d'Escoto, the Nicaraguan
foreign minister, about repatriating the 12,000 Contras now camped
in Honduras with their families.
   When he learned the demobilization date had been set, d'Escoto
said: ``That is very good news, we have wanted that for a very long
time.''
   The Tela Declaration signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala called
for the Contras to be disbanded and repatriated or resettled in
other countries over a three-month period beginning in September and
ending in December.
   El Salvador now wants its Central American neighbors to focus
their attention on disbanding leftist rebels fighting its government.
   The U.N.-OAS statement alluded to that goal by saying the
Commission to be established Sept. 6 also would seek to disband and
resettle ``all those involved in armed actions in the countries of
the region when they voluntarily seek it.''
   U.N. officials has opened an office in Managua to observe voter
registration in Nicaragua. It will be the first time the world body
has monitored a national election in an independent country.
   About 10 civilian U.N. poll watchers arrived Thursday in Managua
and have conferred with Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council, U.N.
spokesman Francois Giuliani said.
   Nicaragua pledged under the Central American peace agreement of
1987 to hold free and fair national elections. They have been set
for Feb. 25.

<TEXT>
   A judge found a drifter guilty of
first-degree murder Friday in the beating death of a 24-year-old
woman who had just started working as an intern reporter at the
local newspaper.
   Rodney Woidtke, 28, was convicted of killing Audrey Cardenas, a
recent graduate of Texas A&amp;M University who had been in town only 11
days when she disappeared June 19, 1988.
   Her nude body was found in a dry creek bed a week later by a
custodian at Belleville Township High School East. Ms. Cardenas,
formerly of Bakersfield, Calif., had come to Illinois to work for
the Belleville News-Democrat.
   Judge Richard A. Aguirre, who presided over the five-day bench
trial, set sentencing for Sept. 28. Woidtke could face a 20- to
60-year sentence.
   In closing arguments earlier Friday, defense attorney Brian K.
Trentmann said police made Woidtke a scapegoat in the slaying and
failed to fully examine the possibility of other suspects.
   ``They picked up this poor transient who clearly has a mental
problem and threw him in the slammer,'' Trentmann said.
   Scott Mansfield, assistant St. Clair County state's attorney,
said Woidtke knew too much about the crime scene to be innocent _
including the position of the pipe used in the murder.
   ``I think the evidence shows clearly that the defendant is a
troubled person, full of sexual delusions, feelings of sexual
inadequacies, with a burning desire to find a woman and have a
relationship,'' Mansfield said.
   ``He decided to take that action and got himself a woman. We
don't know how, but he got Audrey Cardenas.''
   At a pre-trial hearing last week, police Sgt. Mark Heffernan said
that when he interviewed Woidtke on June 27, 1988 _ the day he was
arrested for crossing police lines near the site where the body was
discovered a day earlier _ the first question he asked was whether
the suspect had killed and sexually assaulted Ms. Cardenas.
   ``He answered yes and no. He answered that he had killed her but
that he did not rape her,'' Heffernan said.
   It could not be determined whether Ms. Cardenas had been raped
because of the decomposition of her body, authorities said.
   Court-appointed psychologist Dr. Daniel Cuneo testified Friday
that when he first examined Woidtke last summer, he concluded the
defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic.
   Woidtke initially was ruled unfit to stand trial in Ms. Cardenas'
death.
   In June, based on a report by a psychiatrist at the Chester
Mental Health Center that he had made substantial improvement, a
judge declared Woidtke fit for trial.

   A Guardian Angel whose shooting death
last weekend led to protests and accusations from the crimefighting
group had killed himself playing Russian roulette with two members,
one of them 14, authorities in this District of Columbia suburb said
Friday.
   ``I should have used more caution'' before criticizing police and
publicly naming two people as the suspected killers, said Guardian
Angels founder Curtis Sliwa after learning of the results of the
police investigation.
   Sliwa also said he would meet with members of the civilian group
to emphasize its policy against weapons.
   Prince George's County police Lt. Col. Robert Phillips said
Dorian Brown, 19, had apparently initiated the game and was the
first one to pull the trigger on the .357-caliber Magnum when he was
killed late Saturday night.
   One of the other two was 14 years old and the other was 22,
Phillips said, refusing to name them. He also said Brown had been
drinking and with a blood alcohol level of 0.07 percent was close to
the 0.08 percent concentration that Maryland uses to define as
``under the influence'' of alcohol. The state defines
``intoxicated'' as 0.10 percent.
   ``It's just a terrible tragedy for the group, for Dorian and the
community at large,'' Sliwa said.
   Russian roulette is played by loading only one round into a
revolver and spinning the cylinder. The player then points the gun
at his own head and pulls the trigger, hoping the hammer strikes an
empty chamber.
   The shooting happened in the organization's office in a
drug-ridden apartment complex where the group has patrolled since
April. The group immediately claimed the recruit was killed by drug
dealers and organized several demonstrations this week to protest
Brown's death.
   Phillips said the tragedy began when Brown found the door to the
office ajar.
   Sliwa said Brown ``called in two recruits that he knew
personally.''
   ``Because one of them assumed there was a break-in, one took his
father's revolver,'' Sliwa said. ``They went to the headquarters and
were sitting around. Apparently Dorian had booze and he and one
other (recruit) were drinking and the other one took the weapon
out.''
   Sliwa said he would reinforce the anti-weapons policy ``in the
face of this prevailing notion that you solve problems with a gun.''
   Earlier in the day, bounty hunters captured a member of the
Guardian Angels unit, Michael Marshall, 19, who they said had failed
to appear in Baltimore County Circuit Court on a robbery charge.

<TEXT>
   The West, while applauding Poland's new
Solidarity government, is being reticent about helping the country
get back on its economic feet, Lech Walesa said in a television
interview.
   In an interview with Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20-20,'' Walesa
said the world _ including the United States _ would be blamed if
Poland does not get any more financial help and the fledging
Solidarity government fails to bring economic prosperity.
   The interview was scheduled for broadcast Friday evening.
   Walesa said Solidarity's vision involved a mixture of
philosophies and practices combining the best of capitalism with the
best of what Poland has now.
   ``We're not able to do it by ourselves alone, and we ask
everybody who is listening to us to loosen the loop of our debt,''
Walesa said. ``Today the West is applauding Poland, but it's
behaving like a young lady who wants to, but she is afraid at the
same time.''
   He invited joint ventures and said: ``Give us the money, we'll
implement the contract, and we'll give the money back. ... We want
cooperation. We don't want new debts.''
   Poland's failure would be the world's failure, he said.
   ``I will say that, if we fail, we can blame the world, even the
United States, that you haven't contributed with cooperation in
these conditions of civilization development, you will be to blame
for Polish failure,'' Walesa said.
   Asked if Poland wanted to emulate the United States, he said:
``Who wouldn't want to be the United States? ... But, on the other
hand, we would like to leave what is good in our country, to retain
what is good in our country, so it would be a mixture of the United
States and Poland.''
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki assumed office Thursday in a
historic transfer of power from the Communist Party to a
Solidarity-led coalition, the first government led by non-Communists
in the East bloc.

<TEXT>
   Police are interrogating three suspects in
the slaying of George Adamson, the British conservationist who
devoted his life to returning lions born in captivity to the wild,
the ruling party newspaper said.
   The Kenya Times said police arrested the three men in northern
Kora National Reserve, where Adamson and two assistants were shot
and killed Sunday by three robbers armed with automatic rifles. It
did not say when the suspects were arrested.
   Adamson's slaying was the third fatal attack in the wilds of this
East African nation since July. Publicity surrounding his death and
the slayings of an American woman and a French couple threatens to
harm Kenya's tourism industry, the country's prime foreign currency
earner.
   Officials say travel basically is safe. They blame the recent
violence partly on a massive effort to save Kenya's elephants, which
they say has driven well-armed poachers to other forms of banditry.
   The Times, owned by the governing Kenya African National Union,
said police plan to parade the suspects for possible identification
before Adamson's workers who witnessed the killings.
   Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo was not available for comment,
and Richard Leakey, the director of wildlife management, said he had
no way to confirm or deny the report.
   Adamson, 83, earned international fame for his work with his wife
Joy to return lions to the wild. Their achievements are detailed in
the film ``Born Free'' and a sequel, ``Living Free.'' Both movies
are based on books by his wife, who was killed at northwestern
Shamba Game Reserve in 1980 by a servant she had dismissed on
suspicion of theft.
   Adamson moved into Kora National Reserve in 1971 and helped
dozens of lions learn to survive in the bush before freeing them.
   He and his wife separated in the late 1960s and had no children.
   Leakey said Adamson, who was called the Lion Man of Kenya, will
be buried with honors at Kora National Reserve next week.

<TEXT>
   A former federal drug agent charged with cocaine
trafficking allegedly confessed to the crime the night he was
arrested, according to testimony Thursday in federal court.
   But Edward O'Brien's defense attorneys portrayed him as a man
known by government investigators to be in deep financial and
emotional trouble months before they set him up and arrested him in
an undercover sting.
   O'Brien signed a statement Aug. 15 saying that on two occasions
he was paid a total of $39,000 to ferry drugs with another man from
Florida to Boston for a man who identified himself as a cocaine
dealer, according to a copy of the document presented at the hearing
before U.S. Magistrate Patti Saris.
   Arthur Carter Jr., a senior inspector with the DEA's Office of
Professional Responsibility, also testified that O'Brien admitted
under questioning that he had used a total of $147,000 in DEA money
for personal business, but later replaced the money.
   O'Brien, who formerly ran the DEA office in Springfield, and his
brother John O'Brien were each indicted Thursday on five counts of
cocaine trafficking.
   The two were being held without bail pending the outcome of the
detention hearing, which was expected to resume Friday.
   Charges against a third brother, Paul O'Brien, were dismissed
Thursday, but prosecutor Thomas N. Burrows refused to explain why.
   Attorneys for Edward O'Brien argued that the pre-trial publicity
had already made it impossible for the brothers to get a fair trial.
They asked the judge to close the bail hearing to the public.
   Saris refused, saying the most damaging information has probably
already been disclosed. That decision cleared the way for O'Brien's
alleged confession to be read allowed in court.
   In the five-page statement, O'Brien wrote in longhand that he
brought drugs to Boston twice, once by car for $25,000 and again by
airplane for $14,000. He was arrested after the second trip.
   O'Brien said he gave $8,000 from the first advance to his brother
John to repay a loan to John's girlfriend.
   In addition, O'Brien wrote, ``During the last 2{ years ... I
utilized some of the seized funds which were later replaced. The
total used, but not in one lump sum, was approximately $147,000.''
   O'Brien allegedly used the money to help bail out the family's
floundering company, Cape Cod Ice. Carter testified that Edward
O'Brien told him that John O'Brien had allegedly skimmed some
$230,000 from the business.
   Under cross examination by defense attorneys, Carter acknowledged
that he had information from three informants and a Springfield
police lieutenant as early as February or March indicating that
Edward O'Brien was emotionally unstable and possibly suicidal.
   The defense attempted to show that the DEA never approached
O'Brien about the missing money, or requested a psychological
evaluation, or offered him any kind of help. Instead, the DEA set up
a sting.
   ``You just wait for them to fall,'' concluded John O'Brien's
defense attorney, Richard Cohen.
   ``I'm not a psychiatrist,'' Carter replied. ``My job is to put
people in jail.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadcast engineers, camera workers and
newswriters have accepted a four-year contract with Capital
Cities-ABC Inc.
   The contract goes into effect Saturday for all 2,500 members of
the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians
except two people who make up a newswriters unit in Chicago. Union
officials said something would be worked out soon with the two
holdouts.
   The contract, which replaces one that expired March 31, provides
a first-year ratification bonus ranging from 6.1 percent to 7
percent. There are 3 percent raises in each of the second and third
years and a 4 percent increase in the fourth year.
   ``The contract, although lacking in many areas, is considered by
the union as the best it could obtain under the present
circumstances facing NABET and others in the broadcast industry,''
said John Krieger, a union spokesman.
   ``It was best to reach a settlement through considerable
compromise rather than through any confrontation as we did with NBC
in the 17-week strike in 1987,'' Krieger said.
   NABET represents engineers, camera workers, video tape editors,
newswriters, makeup people, publicists, couriers and traffic and
communication coordinators.
   The contract covers units at Cap Cities-ABC radio and television
network operations and radio and television stations in New York,
Los Angeles, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and various news
bureaus.
   The pressing issue was job security for radio engineers in an era
when broadcast companies are needing their specialized, restricted
services less and less.
   Krieger said the company promised to move the endangered radio
engineers into television if necessary.
   The company said it got increased flexibility to overcome a
number of restrictive work rules, including rules that restricted
certain jobs, such as turning microphones off and on, to engineers.
   The company said the contract also gives it an enhanced ability
to acquire and originate live and taped sports, news and
entertainment programing and broader and more flexible daily
employment rights.
   ``The new contract grants the company the relief we sought since
the negotiations began six months ago, while providing the union
with certain securities it sought,'' Jeffrey Ruthizer, the Cap
Cities-ABC chief negotiator, said in a statement Friday.

during World War II, a newspaper said Friday.
   According to the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper, historian Karl
Teppe has found evidence that 3,000 mentally retarded children were
killed in Dortmund area hospitals after undergoing Nazi experiments
between 1939 and 1945.
   Dortmund chief prosecutor Klaus Schacht was not in his office
Friday and could not be reached for comment on the report.
   The Nazis' fatal experiments on people are part of the historical
record, but the newspaper said the killings uncovered by Teppe were
not previously known.
   Teppe, of Muenster, uncovered the evidence while looking into the
wartime operations of seven hospitals, according to the newspaper.
   One of the institutions was the Dortmund-Aplerbeck hospital,
which now is the Westphalia Clinic for Psychiatry.
   Officials there were shocked by Teppe's conclusions and have
started their own investigation, the newspaper said.
   It quoted clinic official Annette Jedwabski as saying: ``The
doctors and nurses who work in the clinic today are all with
certainty free from blame.''
   But she added, ``We cannot just let this drop, especially since
there are many patients here who themselves certainly would have
become (Nazi) victims.''
   Schacht is worried the investigation could be hindered by the
length of time that has passed since the end of the Nazi era, the
newspaper said.
   ``It is suspected that many documents have disappeared since
1945, and it is still unclear who among the responsible doctors and
nurses is still alive,'' according to the newspaper.
   An estimated 6 million people were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust.

   Soldiers killed a Palestinian youth, a
15-year-old died while being questioned, and an Israeli gold dealer
was kidnapped on a nighttime business trip to the West Bank,
according to army and Arab reports Thursday.
   Israel's Supreme Court rejected appeals by four Palestinians of
army orders to deport them as leaders of the 20-month-old uprising
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shaul Mishaniya, 47, was the first Israeli abducted since the
uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, and officials said the motive might be
criminal. Hundreds of soldiers and police were searching for him.
   The 15-year-old Palestinian died mysteriously Wednesday while
being questioned by soldiers near Jerusalem.
   Arab reporters in the Gaza Strip said a 19-year-old was shot down
Wednesday night by soldiers in civilian dress driving cars with Gaza
license plates. His death was the ninth reported this week in Gaza.
   At least 547 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians in the uprising and 97 have been slain by fellow Arabs as
alleged collaborators. Thirty-eight Israelis have died.
   The army said it detained about 120 Palestinians suspected of
security offenses over the last days. Officials said the West Bank
arrests are likely to continue.
   In the mixed Arab-Jewish Tel Aviv suburb of Jaffa, police
detained seven Arabs suspected of passing weapons to Palestinian
guerrillas in Gaza, the national news agency Itim said.
   In the West Bank, the army imposed curfews on Tulkarem and
surrounding villages while helicopters criss-crossed the area and
security forces conducted a house-to-house search for Mishaniya.
   An Israeli colonel, not identified, said on army radio: ``We go
from one house to another, door to door, to the roofs, basements .
.. as far as the imagination can go.''
   Arabs said Mishaniya was seized after hundreds of masked youths
surrounded an Arab-driven taxi he took to Tulkaren on Wednesday
night.
   Israeli radio quoted his family as saying Mishaniya was having
financial troubles and went to Tulkarem to collect debts from Arab
gold dealers, but Arab sources said he often went to the West Bank
on business at night.
   Few Israelis except Jewish settlers venture into the West Bank,
where cars driven by Israelis are frequent targets of stones and
firebombs.
   Yuval Neeman, a legislator from the right-wing Tehiya Party, said
on Israel radio all residents of the Palestinian refugee camp at
Tulkarem should be deported in retaliation for the kidnapping. That
would be nearly 10,000 people.
   Deportation of the four men whose appeals were rejected would
bring the number expelled in the rebellion to 59. They are Taysir
Aruri, a physics professor whose case has been championed by Israeli
and foreign scientists; Odeh Yusef Maali and Majed Labadi, both
union organizers, and Mohammed Matur, a teacher.
   Officials said Nasser Nabil Nasrallah, 15, was dead on arrival at
Augusta Victoria Hospital on Wednesday night. A cousin, Hamad
Nasrallah, said he died while being questioned by soldiers in
Izzariye, the biblical village of Bethany on Jerusalem's outskirts.
   Hamad said soldiers stopped them and a soldier questioning his
cousin suddenly cried out: ``Your friend is dead!''
   ``I didn't hear any shots or anything,'' Hamad said. ``I saw two
marks, one on his face and one on his arm.''
   Military sources said the youth apparently fainted and died while
being questioned. The army ordered an autopsy.
   The Arab reporters in Gaza said Iyad Omar Abu Kamal, 19, was
killed when soldiers in civilian clothes opened fire on masked
youths painting anti-Israeli slogans on walls in Gaza City.
   An army spokesman, who cannot be identified under military
regulations, said the youths ran when soldiers approached. ``They
looked suspicious,'' he said. ``That's why they were being
arrested.''
   He said soldiers shouted warnings and fired in the air, then
opened fire when the Palestinians kept running.
   Army officials would not say whether the soldiers were disguised.
One source said security forces use disguises when trying to capture
Palestinian ``shock troops'' who attack Arabs accused of
collaborating with Israel.
   Dr. Derick Pounder, a Scottish pathologist, said a second autopsy
on a Palestinian-American killed Aug. 18 revealed that he died of a
bullet wound in the back but provided no clues about who killed him.
   The autopsy was requested by the family of 14-year-old Amjad
Jebril Tawil, who was born in Denver. Relatives accused soldiers of
killing him, but an army statement said its investigation showed
soldiers were not involved.
   In Washington, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee
said that the State Department promised the family of the youth it
would press Israel to complete its investigation of the killing.

   The family of an entertainment executive found
slain in his Beverly Hills mansion believes mobsters had him
executed because he refused to do business with them, his sister
said Friday.
   ``We think he made the mistake of buying a business that had been
used before by the Mafia, and we think he was trying to run it
straight,'' Marta Menendez-Cano of West Palm Beach, Fla., said after
a memorial service.
   Her brother, Jose E. Menendez, was found shot to death Sunday
night along with his wife, Kitty, 44, in their home, a $4 million
Spanish-style mansion with a tennis court.
   Menendez, 45, once headed RCA-Ariola Records as well as the U.S.
rental car operations for the Hertz Corp.
   He was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Live
Entertainment Inc., an affiliate of Carolco Pictures Inc. in the
video and music distribution business, and had been praised for
improving the company's performance.
   Two of the three companies operated by Live Entertainment had
been linked to organized crime before Live Entertainment bought
them, although Live Entertainment acting President Roger R. Smith
has vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob
link.
   Ms. Menendez-Cano, the dead man's sister, and former California
Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, a friend for nearly a decade, described Menendez
as absolutely honest, although an extremely aggressive businessman.
   ``He was very direct, although he had a great sense of humor,''
said Curb, the owner of a small record label who met Menendez when
Curb was negotiating with RCA to distribute a record by the country
act The Judds.
   ``Sometimes he had to tell people things they didn't want to
hear,'' Curb said. ``But he was a wonderful guy, an absolutely
outstanding person. I just can't believe something like this could
happen.''
   Curb and Ms. Menendez-Cano spoke outside a memorial at the
Directors Guild of America in Hollywood, where 400 people listened
to the Menendez's sons, Eric, 18, and Lyle, 22, eulogize their
parents.
   Ms. Menendez-Cano said she had been unaware that two of her
brother's companies had once been linked to organized crime until
she read newspaper stories on the killings. She said her brother had
always tried to keep the video business clean.
   ``The first thing he did was to get rid of the porno business,''
she said. ``Because of his success, he probably was stepping on many
shoes, which some people didn't like.''
   International Video Entertainment, which Live Entertainment
purchased in 1986, had been owned by Noel C. Bloom. Bloom was
identified in a California attorney general's report on organized
crime that year as a major distributor of X-rated movies and a
former associate of the late Michael Zaffarano of the Bonanno
organized-crime family.
   Peter Hoffman, Carolco's president and chief executive, said
International Video Entertainment itself was never involved in
pornography.
   The other company with a crime-linked past was BeckZack Corp.,
which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailing
chain in the Northeast. Live Entertainment completed its acquisition
of BeckZack this June.
   Beckzack's principal shareholder, Morris Levy, was convicted in
May 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler.
He remains free pending an appeal of his conviction.
   An FBI affidavit filed in federal court in New York in connection
with an investigation of Levy quoted an unidentified informant as
saying that a faction of the Genovese crime family owned an interest
in the Strawberries chain. The documents called Levy ``a lucrative
source of cash and property'' for the Genovese family leaders.
   Ms. Menendez-Cano said her brother had big plans to expand. ``He
said he would be controlling the East Coast video business, through
his careful planning, in the next couple of years.''
   Live Entertainment announced Friday that it was forming a
committee to search for a successor to Menendez.

<HEAD>Second Ethiopian Rebel Group Accepts Carter's Mediation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second rebel group in Ethiopia has approved
former President Jimmy Carter as an observer for peace talks, but a
Carter Center official said Friday the group would not be included
in the discussions here.
   Representatives of Ethiopia and another rebel group, the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front, plan to meet at the Carter Center in
Atlanta beginning Sept. 7 with Carter acting as an observer.
   Earlier this week, the Tigre People's Liberation Front announced
in a clandestine radio broadcast that it was accepting Carter,
calling on the Ethiopian government to ``respond quickly'' to the
proposal.
   Dayle E. Powell, a Carter Center fellow who heads the
presidential library's conflict resolution programs, said the
Tigrean announcement was welcome news, but that their conflict with
the Ethiopian government is unrelated to that of the Eritreans.
   As a result, Ms. Powell said, talks between the Ethiopian
government and the Tigreans could not be included in the September
meeting. She added that Carter would get involved in the Tigrean
issue only if Ethiopia also agreed.
   The Tigrean rebels, based in Tigray province, took up arms 14
years ago to press for increased autonomy for their region.
   Early this year, they scored several major victories and forced
troops out of five towns, including the provincial capital of
Mekele, 470 miles northwest of Addis Ababa.
   The Eritreans, in Ethiopia's northernmost Eritrea province, have
been fighting for independence since 1961.
   Both rebel groups agreed to peace talks after President Mengistu
Haile Mariam's announcement in June that the government had no
preconditions and welcomed an independent observer.

   Carnegie Hall officials said Friday they are

of the great hall that some critics said was lost in a 1986 interior
renovation.
   Officials hope to have the work done in time for the 1989-90
music season, said Executive Director Judith Arron.
   To introduce acoustical absorption within the mid- and
high-frequency ranges, workers are spraying a cellulose acoustical
material on the stage ceiling, and putting panels of 100 percent
wool felt on the stage's back wall.
   Second, sound-diffusing panels will be placed across the entire
rear wall to control the reflection of sound from the wall back to
the stage, Arron said.

   The former clerk of Cook County Circuit Court, the
nation's largest court system, was sentenced Friday to 10 years in
prison for corruption uncovered during the federal ``Operation
Incubator'' probe.
   Morgan Finley, 63, stood silently with his arms folded across his
chest as U.S. District Judge Ilana Rovner sentenced him for taking
bribes, threatening a witness and attempted extortion.
   Finley pleaded for leniency before the sentencing. ``I am sorry
that I involved myself in this mess, not only for myself, but mostly
for my wife and family,'' he said.
   Ms. Rovner ordered him to turn himself in to authorities on Oct.
23, pay $50,000 in fines and $25,000 in restitution for bribes he
took.
   ``You and you alone took yourself from the pinnacle of power ...
to stand here in a place you should only have visited in your
official capacity,'' she said.
   ``It is obvious that your representation of all that occurred can
only be characterized at best as skewed, and at worst as lies.''
   The judge also said evidence that Finley had threatened an FBI
agent twice during the trial weighed heavily in the sentencing
decision.
   Ms. Rovner and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson said
videotapes showing Finley taking $7,500 in cash were the most
convincing evidence of his guilt.
   ``Morgan Finley sold the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court
of Cook County in no uncertain terms,'' Raphaelson said. ``Those
tapes show what Morgan Finley is about.''
   Finley's attorney, Louis Garippo, maintained his client was
enticed into taking the bribe. ``The money was there. It was shoved
at him and he took the money,'' Garippo said. ``He is a good man who
was drawn into something.''
   The videotape, viewed during the trial, showed FBI mole Michael
Raymond and former court investigator Michael Lambesis in Raymond's
apartment having lunch with Finley on Dec. 4, 1985.
   Raymond reaches beneath a kitchen apron to pull out a wad of
money, and a hand identified as Finley's extends into the frame of
the film to accept it for help in obtaining a lucrative city
contract.
   Operation Incubator targeted municipal corruption at Chicago's
City Hall. All 16 people indicted as a result of the 18-month
undercover federal investigation first disclosed in December 1985
have been convicted or pleaded guilty.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court Friday overturned
the first-degree assault conviction of an AIDS-infected inmate who
bit a prison guard, but said there was enough evidence to support a
lesser assault charge.
   In a 4-1 ruling, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals said there
was insufficient evidence to uphold Adam Brock's conviction for
first-degree assault and his 15-year sentence.
   But, the judges said, the facts supported a conviction on a
lesser charge of third-degree assault. The appeals court sent the
case back to Limestone County Circuit Court for Brock to be
sentenced for third-degree assault, a misdemeanor punishable by a
maximum one year in jail.
   First-degree assault is a felony involving the use of a deadly
weapon or a dangerous instrument to cause serious physical injury.
   Brock, 31, is confined in a special unit at the Limestone
Correctional Facility in Capshaw for inmates infected with the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.
   In January 1988, Brock scuffled with Officer Jim Gates when Gates
tried to remove prohibited ink pens from Brock's cell. Gates was
bitten on the arm, but three subsequent tests showed no traces of
the AIDS virus.
   Brock was charged with attempted murder in the first criminal
case ever brought in Alabama involving a bite by a person infected
with the AIDS virus, but a jury convicted him of a reduced charge of
first-degree assault.
   The appeals court, in a ruling written by Judge William Bowen,
said the state failed to prove that Brock used his mouth and teeth
under circumstances ``highly capable of causing death or serious
physical injury.''
   ``This court can not take judicial notice that biting is a means
capable of spreading AIDS. While AIDS may very well be transmitted
through a human bite, there was no evidence to that effect at trial
and we do not believe that is established scientific fact,'' the
court ruled.
   The court said, however, that the state did prove elements of
assault in the third degree.
   Under Alabama law a person can be convicted of third-degree
assault if, while trying to prevent a peace officer from performing
his duty, the person causes physical injury to anyone.
   Brock originally was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1977 for
robbery and buying and receiving stolen property in Jefferson
County, Hale said.

weapons-buying plans.
   Fowler, 64, of Springfield, a suburb of Washington, D.C., entered

conspiracy and mail fraud.
   Trial was set for Dec. 4. He could be sentenced to 310 years in
prison and fined $255,000 if convicted on all counts.
   When Fowler was indicted Aug. 15, prosecutors said he removed the
``secret'' label from some documents before circulating them within
Boeing and to other defense contractors.
   Fowler's case is not part of the ``Ill Wind'' investigation of
contracting fraud that has resulted in several convictions of
defense contractor executives.

   A gang of white teen-agers, out to block
interracial dating in their neighborhood, shot and killed a black
youth who happened along with three friends hoping to buy a used
car, officials said Thursday.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said at least 10 and as many as
30 white youths, armed with baseball bats and at least one gun,
committed the killing.
   ``My son will never turn this corner again and it's only because
of this _ the pigment of his skin,'' Freddy Stewart, father of the
slain youth, said Thursday evening. ``This is what America has to
learn _ that we no longer are going to take this. ... All we want is
justice.''
   The gang had gathered to waylay blacks or Hispanics they believed
were headed for a birthday party for an 18-year-old girl, who
recently had rejected her white boyfriend and had been dating black
and Hispanic men, Ward said.
   The spurned boyfriend had threatened the girl and made racist
comments to her, said Deputy Commissioner Alice McGillion.
   The jilted youth was part of the gang that attacked the slain
teen-ager and his friends.
   The commissioner said the identity of the shooter was not known
and the former boyfriend, known so far only by a street name, was
being sought.
   Yusef Hawkins, 16, was killed Wednesday night in Bensonhurst, a
middle-class, largely Italian and Jewish residential neighborhood of
Brooklyn.
   Three white teen-agers had been taken into custody, but no
charges had been filed Thursday, said Chief of Detectives Robert
Colangelo.
   Hawkins and his friends entered the neighborhood to answer a
newspaper ad about a car for sale.
   Ward said the whites followed the blacks for about a block and a
half and that witnesses heard them say to each other: ``Are these
the ones? Is this them?''
   What they didn't know, according to McGillion, was that the girl
had told her new boyfriend not to come and called off her birthday
party.
   McGillion said the girl, whose identity was not divulged, saw the
killing from her window.
   ``She knew there was going to be trouble. There were rumblings in
he neighborhood. Her mother had looked out the window and saw the
boys with the bats,'' she said.
   When the white gang stopped and confronted the blacks, four shots
were heard. Hawkins was hit twice in the chest. One of his
companions suffered an arm injury and the other two were not hurt.
   The gang scattered after the shots.
   Police found four .32-caliber shells and a bat at the scene, but
no gun.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. said its New Orleans
plant won a $1.797 billion contract Thursday to produce 60 more
external tanks to fuel the nation's space shuttle through mid-1997.
   The tanks, made of aluminum, steel alloys and titanium, are
produced by Martin Marietta's Manned Space Systems Co. at NASA's
Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans. The plant employs about
3,500 people.
   Each of the huge external tanks, 154 feet long and 28 feet in
diameter, supplies more than 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen fuel
and liquid oxygen oxidizer to the orbiter during lift-off and ascent.
   The super-cold propellants are fed to the orbiter's engines at a
rate of 1,035 gallons per second, emptying the tank in about 8{
minutes. When loaded the tanks weigh 1.676 million pounds; when
empty, 66,000 pounds.
   When loaded, the tank is the largest and heaviest part of the
shuttle and its only major, non-reusable element. It is comprised of
about 481,450 components.
   The first tank to be built under the new contract is to be
completed by late 1991 and the last by mid-1997, the company said.
Under previous contracts, Martin Marietta has produced 52 of 59
external tanks.

   Two explosions ripped apart a grocery store
that was recently the target of an arson fire, hurling debris nearly
a block, and the ensuing blaze gutted three other businesses early
Thursday, authorities said.
   The cause of the fire in the city's Old Town district had not
been determined, but arson investigators considered the blaze
suspicious, said Don Mayer, spokesman for the Portland Fire Bureau.
   ``Somebody wants them out of here and I guess they succeeded this
morning,'' Mayer said.
   Twenty-six people were evacuated from Ma's Community Inn, a
low-income hotel on the same block, Mayer said. The residents were
allowed to return about 9 a.m.
   Hotel manager Gary Cooper said the sound of the first explosion
awakened him. He was looking out his window when the second blast
went off.
   ``I saw all this material flying across the street and a big ball
of fire behind it,'' Cooper said.
   The explosion was centered at a grocery called Savmor Grub, also
the location on July 22 of an arson fire that was started at about
the same time in the morning. That fire caused $125,000 in damage,
Mayer said.
   He said agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms in Seattle were called to assist in the investigation.
   Pieces of the damaged building were thrown at least half a block
away. ``If someone had been walking by, they'd probably had got
blown across the street,'' Mayer said.
   The three businesses destroyed by fire were Demetri's Grocery,
Henry's Resale and the Portland Tattoo Shop, Mayer said. No damage
estimate was immediately available.
   The three-alarm fire broke out at 4:26 a.m. but was under control
by 5:11 a.m., Mayer said.
   A fire bureau investigator said the Savmor Grub building was
owned by Martha Lutz, but her residence was not known. However,
business license records showed the grocery was licensed to Empyreal
Entertainment Inc., an Oregon corporation headed by Willis W. Rees
of Beaverton.
   Rees said by telephone late Thursday that he had sold Savmor Grub
to Sang Min Lee of Portland on March 29. ``Neither Mr. Lee nor I
have any types of enemies that I know of that would do this,'' Rees
said.

   The government intensified its war on
drugs, ordering cocaine traffickers to surface and claim $200

series of deadly bomb and arson attacks.
   Using emergency powers under a four-year state of siege,
President Virgilio Barco issued a decree Thursday requiring owners
of the seized property personally to make claims for restitution and
barring them from using real estate agents, lawyers or other fronts.
   Police and military agents have seized hundreds of luxurious
mansions, ranches, office buildings, shops and restaurants across
the country along with airplanes, helicopters, cars, trucks and
other items in an unprecedented offensive.
   Defense Ministry officials put the total value of the goods at
about $200 million.

   Stock market analysts say the risk of a financial
meltdown is far lower today than it was two years ago, the last time
the Dow Jones industrial average was in record territory.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 key industrial company stocks jumped
56.53 points Thursday, carrying it to 2,734.64 and surpassing the
record of 2,722.42 set precisely two years ago today.
   The 1987 peak was the start of a short but severe bear market
that culminated in the worst day in Wall Street history, the
508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials on Oct. 19, 1987.
   Evidence of that debacle was hard to find Thursday.
   Supporting the stock market in 1989 are a healthy dollar,
relatively low interest rates and optimism that the economy will
manage to steer a middle course between recession and high inflation.

   Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki
became the East bloc's first non-Communist prime minister and
indicated he was ready for the formidable challenge of inspiring
disillusioned Poles and staving off economic disaster.
   Communist Party and Solidarity lawmakers united Thursday to elect
the journalist and former political prisoner in a historic 378-4
vote with 41 abstentions.
   Mazowiecki is the first non-Communist to lead Poland since 1944.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who engineered Mazowiecki's
election, was the first to celebrate.

   Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose, maintaining
his innocence, completed a plunge from baseball's pantheon to exile
when he was banished from the sport for life.
   Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti permanently barred
Rose on Thursday for having bet on his own team.
   ``One of the game's greatest players has engaged in a variety of
acts which have stained the game,'' Giamatti said, ``and he must now
live with the consequences of those acts.''
   Rose, 48, one of the greatest players in the history of baseball,
had been under scrutiny for six months. In the end, Giamatti
concluded that ``there was no position that I could take ... except
permanent ineligibility.''
   Rose again denied the central charge: that he bet on the Reds
numerous times during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons. Two former
associates, Ronald Peters and Paul G. Janszen, told baseball
investigators of Rose's gambling and supplied documents that backed
their claims.

   Researchers who isolated the gene that causes
cystic fibrosis say the discovery may lead to breakthrough therapy

   Racial violence flared once again in New York,
where police said a gang of white teen-agers, out to block an
interracial couple from getting together, shot and killed a black
youth who happened along.
   In a killing reminiscent of the Howard Beach case, as many as 30
white youths with baseball bats and at least one gun chased
16-year-old Yusef Hawkins and three of his friends, culminating with
Hawkins' slaying, police said. The black teen-agers said they were
going to meet someone selling a used car.
   In 1986, a group of white teen-agers in the Howard Beach section
of Queens chased three blacks, one of whom was hit by a car and
killed.
   In Brooklyn's mostly Italian-American Bensonhurst section
Wednesday night, the white gang gathered to waylay blacks or
Hispanics they believed were headed for a young woman's birthday
party in the neighborhood, authorities said.

   Voyager 2 brushed by Neptune's north pole
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,
fault-cracked Triton, revealing ``a world unlike any we've ever
seen,'' NASA said Friday.
   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar
system,'' said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom,
deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,
12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over
Neptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, the
planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900
miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m PDT Friday.
   Voyager's closest photos of Triton were recorded on tape for
playback to earth this weekend, but those returned Friday astounded
scientists. Soderblom said they showed at least three volcanoes, now
inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen
natural gas or nitrogen ice.

   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said Friday he was
trying to change the life of a male prostitute he had once
patronized when he hired him as a personal aide, and later felt
duped when he suspected the man was selling sex from Frank's
Washington apartment.
   Frank, a Democrat who disclosed his homosexuality in May 1987,
said he became friends with the man after their first paid
encounter, and was trying to wean him from a life of drugs and
prostitution. He fired the man in August 1987 when it appeared his
effort had failed.
   ``Thinking I was going to be Henry Higgins and trying to turn him
into Pygmalion was the biggest mistake I ever made,'' Frank, 49,
said during a news conference at his office in this Boston suburb.
He referred to the character in the play ``Pygmalion'' and the
musical based on it, ``My Fair Lady,'' a professor who tries to turn
a poor London woman into a lady.
   He also said Gobie offered on three occasions to arrange sex
partners and Frank declined. ``His suggestion that he was procuring
sex partners for me is a lie,'' Frank said.

   Four years ago in Austin, Texas, Laurie Freelove
had a plan: She wanted to meet Gretchen Phillips and start a band
with her.
   Around that same time, Phillips was mourning the demise of her
previous group, Meat Joy, and longed to start another one. She and
Freelove met and were soon playing guitar together at coffee houses.
They performed Monkees songs, rock 'n' roll, old movie tunes as well
as their own material.
   They called themselves Two Nice Girls.
   A few months later, Freelove and Phillips met Kathy Korniloff and
were so pleased with how their voices and guitars sounded together
they decided to add her to the group.
   The name? Two Nice Girls.
   ``That was my idea,'' Phillips explained. ``It beat the hell of
out of The Jackson Five. Some friends of mine were in a band called
Five Happy Guys. One of them left so they changed the name to The
Happiness Crew. We were called Two Nice Girls and hired somebody
else, but I didn't want to change the name.''
   They are a major part of a lively Austin music scene that has
attracted the attention of critics around the country. All three
Nice Girls, however, grew up elsewhere.
   Phillips attended Houston's High School for the Performing Arts
and headed to Austin after graduating.
   ``My first song was a duet that I wrote for my sister and I,''
she recalled. ``We would take baths together and it would take
forever. The song went, `102, oo oo oo . . 107, 111.' That was it.
Then we would take the washcloth and suck the water out of it. I had
no idea what it was about.''
   Freelove grew up in Alexandria, Va., and went to a Catholic
girls' high school outside of Rome.
   ``I've been writing songs since I was this high,'' Freelove said.
``I used to have to vacuum and clean the house and I used to make up
songs. I have tapes of almost everything I've done. I've got gobs of
tapes of when I was a little guy. I was a much better songwriter
when I was 13.''
   Korniloff, the daughter of violinists, lived in The Netherlands
and Scarsdale, N.Y.
   ``My first song was a very, very sad love song about a boy who
was supposed to my boyfriend who I caught with another girl. I was
so devastated. I went upstairs to the attic of my house with my
little guitar and played my heart out.''
   Their debut album, ``2 Nice Girls,'' features original songs from
all three and a unique overlapping of Lou Reed's ``Sweet Jane'' and
Joan Armatrading's ``Love and Affection.'' The version on ``2 Nice
Girls'' was a live performance on an Austin public radio station.
   ``We went on for an hour-long program called `Live Set,'''
Korniloff said. ``Our friends were all invited to be in the studio
and lend that live clapping air to the show.
   ``We tried a couple of times to record the song in the studio,
but we could never recapture vocally what we did that one time. As
it turned out, the station still had the master copy on two-track
which they let us use. They said, `It's your performance; we only
have the tape.'''
   The melodies and sweet harmonies make Two Nice Girls easy to
listen to, but ``My Heart Crawls Off,'' written by Phillips and Sara
Hickman, is a bitter song about jealousy.
   ``That's the power of being a songwriter,'' Phillips said. ``I
just wrote this horrible song about (President) Bush that's got a
really lovely melody. If I just made another punk anthem called `I
Hate You,' it wouldn't be really effective.''
   Freelove wrote ``Money,'' a long way from the Motown hit of the
same title that proclaimed, ``The best things in life are free, but
you can keep it for the bird and bees.'' Instead, Freelove warns
against being ``a slave to money.''
   ``It's about money and obsession and the ways it numbs you out,''
Freelove said. ``Money keeps many of us protected from distressing
things, disturbing things. People who have money can shield
themselves from observing the homeless.''
   Their sound recalls The Roches and Indigo Girls. But what could
have influenced Phillips' ``I Spent my Last Ten Dollars (on Birth
Control and Beer)'' or ``The Holland Song,'' in which Korniloff
sings, ``The Dutch are too much''?
   ``I don't really think of these songs as song of experience, but
songs of perspective,'' she said. ``I think that the content of the
songs are much more about how life ought to be. What we'd like for
it to be like.
   ``We consciously try to create a sense of community. It's more
likely to save us from horribly depressing lives. You have some sort
of good feelings. Bands are at an advantage, they're capable of
doing that.''

   Andy Griffith is a man who likes to bring his
work home, but this is the first chance he's had to do that in more
than 40 years.
   This historic village on the North Carolina coast where
Griffith's acting career began is the backdrop for the season opener
for his television series ``Matlock.''
   ``I always wanted to bring a show here,'' Griffith said recently
in a break from filming. ``I thought it would be good for the town
and good for the company.''
   A native of Mount Airy and graduate of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Griffith put fictional Mayberry, N.C., on
the map.
   That was in his popular TV series ``The Andy Griffith Show'' and
yet, he said, the producers of that show saw no point in taping in
the state because people already believed it was done here.
   When Griffith suggested filming an episode of ``Matlock'' in
North Carolina, he had no trouble persuading the producers.
   ``We took a flight down here and fell in love,'' said supervising
producer Jeff Peters. ``He loved the show so much he brought it
home. Andy puts himself totally into this, especially in this
episode. These are his people and his friends.''
   The two-hour show, which will air on NBC on Sept. 19, was filmed
entirely on and around Roanoke Island, where the first English
colonists landed and where Griffith has had a home for more than 30
years.
   The episode, ``The Hunting Party,'' has Ben Matlock called to
defend a man accused of killing a member of his brother's hunting
group. Matlock discovers a hostile environment that may hinder a
fair trial.
   About 20 local residents were hired for the crew and dozens as
extras in the cast.
   ``This is a valentine from Andy for the whole community,'' said
Della Basnight, whose family has been friends with Griffith since he
played Sir Walter Raleigh for five summers in the outdoor musical
drama, ``The Lost Colony.''
   During the ``Matlock'' taping, art sometimes imitated life. In
the closing scene, the crowd cheered as Matlock, a big city lawyer
from Atlanta, emerged victorious from the courthouse.
   Ms. Basnight and a handful of her relatives, who play themselves,
descend on Matlock for photos as part of the scene.
   ``Smile,'' said Ms. Basnight's 79-year-old mother, Cora Mae
Basnight, as she is pushed next to Matlock for a pose to complete
the scene.
   ``Andy came up to the house and asked me `did I like to play in
it' and I said `yes,''' explained Mrs. Basnight, whose late husband,
Saint Clair Basnight Sr., and Griffith were good friends.
   ``Daddy also went barefoot around town and so did Andy,''
recalled Saint Clair Basnight Jr., who has a few speaking lines in
the show. ``Two or three times a year you see him (Griffith) in
town, in the hardware store. ... To him, I think this is home. He's
never lost touch.''
   Griffith made sure a lot of the local flavor shows through in the
episode. Beach scenes were shot in Nags Head, while other segments
were shot at the Lost Colony Theater and along the Roanoke Sound
waterfront.
   Griffith said playing Ben Matlock has been the highlight of his
career, which has included characters ranging from the bumbling Will
Stockwell in the comedy film ``No Time For Sergeants'' to Sheriff
Andy Taylor in ``The Andy Griffith Show.''
   ``It's the best role I ever played,'' Griffith said. ``Andy
Taylor was a wonderful character, and it was the best experience of
my professional life.''
   Griffith, who has added former co-star Don Knotts to the
``Matlock'' cast, said ``The Andy Griffith Show'' provided him eight
years of ``fine creative experience.''
   But he said Ben Matlock and Andy Taylor don't have that much in
common, except that ``both come out of my innards.''
   ``Andy Taylor was a very, very good man,'' he said. ``Matlock is
a good man, but he wants to win. He's very shrewd.''
   Griffith, who expects ``Matlock'' to end after its fifth season,
plans to make Manteo his permanent home and use it as a work base.
   ``Andy _ America loves him,'' Peters said. ``He's got this
tremendous following. He's one of those stars who have endured and
endeared.''

<HEAD>Rail Trails Slow to Catch on in Indiana</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hoosiers trying to join a nationwide movement
to turn railroad corridors into long, narrow parks for hiking and
biking are being blocked just like a busy street by a slow-moving
freight train.
   ``Indiana is surrounded by states that are really taking a lead
on these rails-to-trails programs,'' said Peter Harnik of the
Washington-based Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. ``I'd say Hoosiers are
missing a great opportunity.''
   At least seven Indiana cities _ Hammond, Highland, Hobart,
Chesterton, Carmel, LaPorte and Portage _ are trying to create
linear parks from unused railroad rights-of-way; the Hoosier
Rails-to-Trails Council is lobbying Indianapolis officials to turn
one into a trail through the city.
   Most cities are short on the money to develop trails. In others,
residents express concern about the effects of a surge in
recreational visitors. However, advocates say crime goes down and
the local economy improves when tourists flock to well-kept rail
trails.
   ``We're missing the boat financially,'' said Ed Paynter,
treasurer of the Indianapolis group. ``We're missing the boat
recreationally.''
   In 1916, the United States had the largest railroad system in the
world with more than 250,000 miles of track. As trucks, planes,
buses and cars began to take over, railroads merged, consolidated
their routes and shut down.
   Nationwide, railroads each year abandon more than 3,000 miles of
track. The President's Commission on Americans Outdoors recommended
turning the corridors into paths for hiking, biking and horseback
riding. Congress last year passed the National Trails System
Improvement Act, requiring the Interstate Commerce Commission and
National Park Service to encourage such conversion.
   As of January, 32 states had created 2,700 miles of rail trails
with an average length of 13.3 miles, according to the
Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. The leaders include Wisconsin, with 18
trails totaling 443 miles; Illinois, with 20 measuring 203 miles;
and Ohio, with 11 totaling 142 miles.
   In Indiana, more than 2,400 miles of tracks lie unused.
   Highland leaders envision a 2{-mile trail cutting diagonally
across the northwestern Indiana city, which has gained use of two
abandoned rights-of-way. The 200-foot-wide corridor is being
developed piecemeal during a search for contractors willing to level
it in exchange for the materials there.
   ``There is a market for that if you are willing to not do it all
at once. To date it hasn't cost us anything, but all we have to show
for it is a half-mile section,'' said Parks and Recreation
Superintendent Frank N. DeAtley.
   In Portage, planners wanting to use two abandoned railways _ the
Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and the Norfolk Southern _ to link four
parks are stalled in negotiations over price. The five-mile trails
would intersect in an ``X'' and allow residents to ride to all four
corners of the northwestern city.
   Carmel Mayor Dorothy Hancock wants to create a five-mile trail
along a Monon corridor that goes south into Indianapolis.The
railroad wants $965,000, but Hancock said, ``That's not anything we
would pay or think about paying.''
   The city hopes to start next summer by opening a one-mile path.
Meanwhile, attorneys are researching the railroad's title to the
rest of the corridor.
   Hammond Mayor Thomas McDermott wants to develop 4{ miles of the
Erie Lackawanna into an urban trail that might eventually link the
northwestern city to nearby Griffith and Chesterton.
   ``We're encountering some heavy opposition by the Common Council
because they're not willing to put up any money to develop it,''
said planner Valerie Dehner. ``They don't see it as an amenity or an
economic tool, which it definitely can be.''
   In Indianapolis, a coalition of 600 businesses and other
supporters have tried to persuade officials to create a trail in the
Monon corridor that once carried people to Chicago. The city bought
it from CSX Transportation with an $800,000 loan from the Urban Mass
Transportation Administration. If it is used for mass transit within
10 years, the city does not have to repay the money.
   A trail would not meet that provision. Other options include a
high-speed bus line, a monorail or an elevated train. A series of
public hearings will be held to determine the best use, said Dave
Arland, a spokesman for Mayor William Hudnut. ``We want that
corridor to be used for whatever the majority of people want it to
be used for.''
   That process can take years, and trail advocates are becoming
impatient.
   ``It can be done. They all forget the process needs to be
continuously reactivated in their minds,'' said Allen Kress, a
planner with the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission.
``Trails are a long-time investment and a long-time commitment is
needed to them.''

   Paris' most celebrated prostitute lay in her coffin
surrounded by flowers as faded as the era, and admired by two men as
jaded as the times.
   Manouche's wake in the plush red parlor of the bordello is the
beginning, not the end, of a friendship that introduces the
soon-to-be scandalous author Henry Miller to the hedonistic
pleasures of Paris in the 1930s.
   ``As you know it is a little my fault,'' chuckles renowned French
film director Claude Chabrol, puffing on a pipe as he surveyed his
gaudy vision of a prewar French cathouse.
   ``I wanted to make a film on sex for a long time. I didn't o it
because I had other projects.''
   Chabrol fulfills his fantasy in ``Clichy Days,'' a film adapted
from the baudy autobiographical novel ``Quiet Days in Clichy'' by
the author of ``Tropic of Cancer'' and ``Tropic of Capricorn.''
   The film is being shot on location in Paris, Florence and Rome
and in a studio at Cinecitta, the Italian Hollywood on the outskirts
of Rome. It is intended for release next summer.
   ``I must say it is interesting now to make a film about sex
because I think after the liberation of sexuality in the '70s it was
very, very childish. Now it seems to be a little more puritanical
than before. So I think now is a good moment to say that you can
speak of sex without it being a dirty thing,'' Chabrol said.
   ``Another thing that is very interesting is the period, the
1930s. It is in Europe at the beginning of Hitler, ... and I must
say the intellectuals in general and the American intellectuals in
Europe at that time didn't see anything. They weren't interested in
those things at all. I would like to show the character here who
tries to find his own freedom, his own lucidity and despite that he
doesn't see what happens beside him.''
   Chabrol cast 26-year-old Andrew McCarthy in the role of Miller,
who at 42 was discovering the bohemian lifestyle of prewar Paris,
indifferent to the sorrows of the Depression at home and to the
signs of impending war in Europe.
   ``Well, Henry Miller. You don't get a chance to be Henry Miller
very often,'' said McCarthy, who became a hero of the bubble-gum set
in such critical bombs as ``St. Elmo's Fire.''
   ``He is a notorious rogue. It is a lot of fun. I think it is fun
because of Chabrol.''
   ``I think he has an amazing knowledge of the cinema,'' added
Nigel Havers, the British actor who plays Alfred, the friend who
introduces Miller to his new life in Paris. ``He shoots exactly what
he wants and he knows exactly what he wants. It is a wonderful way
of working.''
   Chabrol's way of working has changed a lot since the young critic
for Cahiers du Cinema led the New Wave of French directors with his
first film, ``Le Beau Serge,'' in 1958. He gained international fame
over the next few years with ``Les Cousins'' in 1959 and ``Les
Bonnes Femmes'' in 1960.
   He suffered a string of commercially inspired critical failures
in the early 1960s, but later regained his reputation with such
films as ``Les Biches'' and ``La Femme Infidele.''
   ``You know, I have made too many films now, even too many bad
films. Now I'm almost an old man and I just do what I like. ...
That's all.
   ``I'm not sure all my films will be good now, but I am sure I
want to do them. It was not exactly the same thing in the past.
Sometimes I accepted things,'' said the 59-year-old filmmaker.
   Miller's ``Quiet Days in Clichy,'' he said, offered him the
chance to do at once the film on sex and several other projects he
had in mind.
   ``I had read it and remembered it as very well-written but really
almost a pornographic book. But I read it (again) and found exactly
the things I wanted to make,'' he said.
   ``Two years ago I had an idea to make a film about the American
intellectuals, especially those in the '30s. I had at the same time
another idea to make a film about a young girl of about 14.''
   The little girl is Colette, played by Stephania Cotta, the
15-year-old granddaughter of Manouche who ends up living with Miller
and Alfred.
   Chabrol and co-writer Ugo Leonzio used the book as the basis, but
not a script, for their screenplay.
   ``If your read Miller's book ... it is really trashy. He always
changes reality. He changes it to garbage. And it is not ... the
truth. I don't like that so I changed the reality, too.
   ``But on the other side,'' said Chabrol, ``that is why we have
big sets and too beautiful things. They are the other side of the
lie.''

   Ray Horne cursed the smooth-as-glass water in a
35-acre pothole on his farm, even though he knew it made a rich
wildlife breeding area.
   ``That depression does no good for me except it might raise a
pair of ducks,'' he said. ``As a farmer, it's no good for me.''
   Horne won't be draining this wetland, even though he has all the
permits he needs. Instead, next winter, he'll haul dirt onto the
ice-covered pond so when spring arrives, mounds will sprout to
produce ideal nesting habitat for ducks.
   Horne's change of heart comes at a price. He and some neighbors
are negotiating an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
that could pay them up to $40 an acre to raise ducks.
   Their willingness to negotiate, officials say, represents a real
breakthrough in relations that could end the wetlands war, North
Dakota's most controversial environmental issue.
   ``The signal, I think, is that Wildlife is able to sit down at
the table, not demanding that every wetland be preserved, and
agriculture is saying, `We don't want to drain and are willing to
save some,''' said Lloyd Jones, state game and fish commissioner and
former director of wetlands habitat for the Fish and Wildlife
Service. ``That is something that didn't happen in the history of
North Dakota and is happening now.''
   Unlike other states, North Dakota does not have serious problems
with dirty water and air. In fact, other than draining wetlands, the
biggest environmental concern looming for the state is how to get
rid of its garbage.
   The wetlands war has pitted landowners against wildlife
interests, but the ramifications move the issue closer to urban
consumers by affecting the quality of the wildlife habitat and water
available for outdoor recreation.
   Before settlers pushed onto the prairie, North Dakota had 5
million acres of wetlands, marshy land teeming with wildlife. Just 2
million acres remain, Jones said, and he is determined to preserve
them.
   ``We are seeing a lot of things go wrong with 2 million acres and
we can't get by with anything less,'' he said.
   Wetlands act as a natural filter, concentrating fertilizer and
other runoff, then releasing more polluted water into lakes and
streams. Draining the bowl-like indentations dotting the prairie in
eastern North Dakota has disrupted the area's hydrology and removed
natural storage tanks, increasing the chances of flooding, Jones
said. It also removed natural habitat for ducks and geese.
   The drainage was spurred by farmers' desire to plant on some of
their most fertile soil. The federal government even paid them at
one time to drain their sloughs. ``There was a strong public
attitude that wetlands were wastelands,'' Jones said. Through the
1970s, farmers drained about 20,000 acres a year.
   By 1987, the Legislature passed a law requiring that each acre
drained had to be replaced, the so-called no-net-loss policy, which
took effect July 1.
   ``I am real optimistic that the future for wetlands has never
been better in North Dakota,'' Jones said. ``People are getting
along a lot better now. People trust each other a lot more now.''
   Not everyone shares that optimism.
   ``I don't know if there is a final solution,'' said Ramsey County
Commissioner Lloyd Stromme. Landowners in his area remain unhappy
with the no-net-loss law and want it repealed; they are disgusted
that the federal government obtains land without paying full taxes
on it, he sid.
   State Rep. Gordon Berg _ whose critics call him ``Mr. Draino''
for his support of wetland drainage _ says landowners must be paid
for their potholes. ``If you don't have the cooperation of the
farmer, you've got nothing.''
   Mike McEnroe of the Fish and Wildlife Service has been
negotiating with Horne and 29 other landowners for preservation of
1,500 acres of wetlands in return for payments of $15 to $40 an
acre. The exact amounts are still being discussed, but an agreement
could be signed within two months, he said.
   ``Rather than fight with people, we figured we would be much
better off working toward the middle ground,'' McEnroe said. ``We
are going kind of slow on this one because we want to find out how
much it costs. If it will work up here on a draining project of this
size, I think it can work anywhere.''
   Horne, driving around his land northwest of Devils Lake, said the
roads and trees have disrupted wetlands as much as draining
potholes. His agreement with the government will let him drain some
of the smaller sloughs in return for preserving and enhancing the
larger, more valuable ones.
   ``I'll be your local in-house manager, and we will raise birds or
whatever,'' he said. ``But I want to get paid for it.''

<BYLINE>For Airline Stocks, How High Is Up? ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever else happens in the stock market over
the next few months, 1989 will go into the history books as the year
the airlines took wing on Wall Street.
   Takeover bids for the parent companies of Northwest and United
have played a large part in transforming an industry long spurned by
many investors into one of the hottest stock groups around.
   That helped Dow Jones's average of 20 transportation stocks reach
new peaks weeks before the 30-stock industrial average did so last
week.
   But there's more to the story than that. And with all its
positive and profitable moments, some analysts say it could still
have an unhappy ending.
   Nobody disputes that solid business reasons exist for the air
transport industry's newfound popularity.
   Traffic, fares and profits are up for most major carriers. The
era of bitter price competition that followed airline deregulation
in the late 1970s appears to be over.
   From its competitors' point of view, the strike that began in
March at Eastern Airlines ``has made a bright situation even
brighter,'' observed the Value Line Investment Survey in its latest
quarterly report on the group.
   ``Pulling Eastern's 6 percent capacity out of the system has
produced a very favorable environment for raising airline fares,''
wrote Value Line analyst Paul Graham.
   Airline stock enthusiasts cite several other pluses: Many
airlines are described as better managed now than they used to be,
and the use of lease financing enables them to expand and modernize
their fleets much more easily.
   On top of all that, the carriers have come to be seen as
attractive to lenders and investors for the assets they own.
   That's where some skeptics begin to voice their reservations
about all the bidding and borrowing that has been taking place.
   An airline is simply the wrong kind of company to qualify as a
good candidate for a buyout financed with debt, argues James Grant
in his newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
   Airlines have heavy capital-spending requirements and unions to
deal with _ and their business has always been very sensitive to the
ups and downs of the economy.
   ``Every airline is a prisoner of the business cycle and a hostage
to the price of fuel,'' Grant says.
   ``We see in the airline lift-off yet another example of debt in
action, making the good times better and casting a shadow over the
future. We suspect that easy credit will sooner or later give way to
hard, or inaccessible, credit.''
   Adds Graham at Value Line: ``We're concerned about the value
being placed on these airline properties.
   ``Interest expense, for example, on borrowings to finance the NWA
buyout will basically wipe out the carrier's earnings in 1990.
That's not an encouraging performance in the strong operating
environment we're forecasting for next year.
   ``In a recession, if one of these debt-laden carriers were to
stumble badly, we fear it could get quite messy.
   ``Moreover, much of the alleged asset value in an airline (e.g.,
lucrative route franchises) can normally only be tapped by breaking
up the company. Few unions will sit idly by while the dismantling is
taking place.
   ``We think airline stock performance will be very volatile in the
next several months,'' Graham concluded. ``Accordingly, we advise
conservative investors to take refuge on the sidelines with those
individuals who don't buy the airline-merger story.''

<TEXT>
   A 20-pound badger killed on a Wyoming
highway is spending the hereafter stuffed in a fierce pose, mounted
on wheels and racing hither and yon trying to scare some sense into
overly friendly ferrets.
   He's called ``Robo-Badger'' by his handlers from the Smithsonian
Institution's National Zoo, who hope his radio-controlled scare
tactics will help ferrets reared in captivity learn to protect
themselves from predators when they are returned to the wild.
   If Robo-Badger's menacing lunges aren't enough to instill fear,
zoo conservationists pelt the puzzled ferrets with rubber bands,
whose harmless stings usually encourage them to dive into the
nearest hole.
   Another fear-inspiring weapon is a stuffed owl with outstretched
wings that swoops down on a hand-operated pulley and string to buzz
the sleek, furry ferrets as they scamper over a dirt mound.
   Here in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains about 80 miles
west of Washington, at a former training camp for U.S. Army cavalry
troops, scientists are conducting ``predator-avoidance training''
for ferrets at an outpost of the National Zoo that is dedicated to
saving endangered wildlife from extinction.
   Wildlife biologist Brian Miller says his project at the zoo's
Conservation and Research Center is aimed at ensuring the survival
of the North American black-footed ferret, which he calls ``one of
the most endangered mammals in the world.''
   Hundreds of thousands of these ferrets, the chief predators of
prairie dogs, once lived in the vast arid grasslands of the West,
from southern Canada to northern Mexico. But they fell victim to
agricultural development and the federal government's program to
eradicate grass-eating prairie dogs as a threat to the livelihood of
cattle ranchers.
   Deprived of their main source of food as well as shelter in
prairie dog burrows, the ferrets rapidly fell prey to disease and
other predators such as great horned owls, golden eagles and
badgers. By 1985, only 10 black-footed ferrets remained, all of them
in Wyoming.
   They were quickly removed to the safety of captivity, where
breeding was begun. Today, says Miller, there are 120 black-footed
ferrets at the Wyoming game and fish research center at Sybille
Canyon, Wyo., the Henry Doorly Zoo at Omaha, Neb., and at Front
Royal.
   ``They were raised in captivity and they know nothing about
predators,'' Miller said in an interview.
   ``They have never seen a badger. Will they duck when they see
one? Will they run into a hole? It's one thing to be afraid, and
another thing to know what to do. We want them to get into that hole
as quickly as possible.''
   Enter Robo-Badger.
   The badger was a road kill found lying alongside a Wyoming
highway. At Miller's request, it was hustled into a freezer and
shipped across the country to Washington, where Smithsonian
taxidermist Paul Rhymer transformed it into a battery-operated robot.
   Stuffed with ears bent back and front paws clawing as if chasing
a prey, the badger was mounted on the chassis of a toy truck with
miniature tractor wheels and a tiny, red-tipped antenna for
receiving radioed stop-and-go and directional commands.
   Miller is experimenting first with 50 Siberian polecats, more
populous first cousins of black-footed ferrets from Soviet Asia
which were bred from stock imported from the Moscow Zoo.
   In the first couple months of testing, the Siberian ferrets seem
mostly curious about Robo-Badger, but more frightened by the
swooping owl.
   Once he has determined what ferrets know instinctively from their
``genetic memory'' about self-protection, feeding, digging into
burrows and other necessities in the wild, Miller will know what
training in captivity is required to prepare the black-footed
variety for its return to the wild.
   If the black-footed ferrets make a comeback there, he said, other
species of plant and animal life _ birds, insects, small mammals and
shrubs _ may also flourish and help restore what was once a ``rich
oasis of diversity'' in the ecosystem of prairie dog communities.
   Working in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
Wyoming game and fish officials and experts at North Carolina State
University, Miller hopes to give the ferrets their freedom in
Wyoming's Absoroka Mountains adjacent to Yellowstone Park sometime
in 1991, if the current population of 57 adults has grown to 200 by
then.
   ``They've had a pretty hard time,'' he said. ``They deserve the
best shot we can give them.''

<HEAD>NRA Pushing Itself into a Corner</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the National Rifle Association's best
friends are worried that the gun lobby may be shooting itself in the
foot.
   A conservative editor and activist says NRA absolutism has kept
it from cooperating with some of its natural allies, among them
conservative groups, police organizations and, in some cases,
Republicans.
   Patrick B. McGuigan, writing in Policy Review, a journal
published by the conservative Heritage Foundation, says that has cut
into NRA political clout and put the organization on the defensive.
   ``Many of the NRA's current difficulties are the result of
self-inflicted wounds,'' he writes. ``During the past few years, the
organization has refused to play coalition politics with its natural
allies in the conservative movement including, most especially,
elements of organized law enforcement.
   ``A go-it-alone approach and a refusal to compromise on less than
critical issues is jeopardizing the NRA's effectiveness in winning
political support on those issues that it considers most important.''
   The NRA has been skirmishing with the Republican administration
in recent months over the government's decision to ban the importing
of 43 types of semiautomatic assault weapons. President Bush signed
that order July 7. Congress is considering legislation that would
impose new restrictions on U.S.-made assault weapons.
   After Bush signed the permanent ban on imports, the NRA said some
of its members wanted to kick him out of the organization. Bush, who
said during the 1988 campaign that he opposed federal gun control,
is a lifetime member of the NRA. A spokesman said he intended to
remain one.
   When the question of city or state gun controls came up Wednesday
at an informal news conference in Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush said
the people of Portland and of Maine should decide for themselves.
   ``The Constitution gives you certain rights in that regard,'' he
added. ``What I want to get is strong support for our anti-crime
package, stronger predictable sentencing, tougher terms, more
judges, more people to make those pay who are breaking the law.''
   The NRA also took on William J. Bennett, director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, who had recommended the ban. James
A. Warner, an NRA lawyer, wrote that U.S. servicemen would be
deprived of their right to bring home assault weapons, and suggested
Bennett might not understand because he was in graduate school
during the height of the Vietnam war.
   ``While you may not be familiar with the life of a serviceman,
for many of these men the chance to bring home firearms while posted
overseas is small recompense for the isolation, the boredom and the
risk of overseas duty,'' Warner wrote.
   There have been more concrete NRA rebukes to the Republicans and
the administration. McGuigan says the NRA and other gun-owners'
groups contributed to the GOP loss of the Indiana House seat once
held by Vice President Dan Quayle, and sat out a Wyoming special
election narrowly won by the Republicans.
   ``This double punishment of the GOP probably served a useful
purpose _ encouraging the Bush administration to refocus its drug
strategies more on crime control than on gun control,'' McGuigan
writes. ``But it also weakened the party that has been most
sympathetic to the NRA overall, and showed a spitefulness toward the
Bush administration, with which it probably should be cooperating,
not fighting.''
   McGuigan also complains that the NRA refused to join forces with
conservatives working for Senate confirmation of Robert H. Bork's
nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. ``As one of the strategists
who sought to secure Bork's confirmation, I know we badly needed the
NRA's help and didn't get it.''
   McGuigan says the NRA apparently was unwilling to help Bork for
fear that he would oppose the suppression of evidence obtained
during investigations and searches that might involve firearms
dealers. He also quotes an NRA official as saying the White House
didn't want an early endorsement of Bork from the controversial gun
group.
   But by his account, other single-interest conservative groups
took up the Bork campaign even though their positions and his were
not in total accord.
   ``By failing to admit the possibility of regulations that do not
limit the basic right to bear arms, the NRA is cutting itself off
from a broader movement of judicial reform,'' McGuigan says.
   He says the organization may be moving in that direction now. His
Heritage Foundation piece reads like an effort to encourage just
that.
   ``America's voters will give strong support to a political
coalition that can push through reform measures to keep dangerous
offenders off the streets,'' McGuigan concludes. ``The NRA can play
a very important role in this coalition, and in so doing channel gun
control into its proper direction.''

<TEXT>
   A $6.2 billion offer for the parent of United
Airlines is the biggest takeover yet proposed by Marvin Davis, but
the Beverly Hills billionaire, ex-wildcatter and glitzy deli owner
has other deals cooking, too.
   Even as Davis awaited UAL Corp.'s response this past week, his
close-knit group searched for other undervalued companies and
eyeballed Europe as a possible hunting ground.
   Davis' son John, a Harvard MBA whose computer research backs up
his father's business instincts, said Davis is looking abroad now
that so many U.S. companies have been bought or dissected by the
1980s takeover frenzy.
   He suggested that Sir James Goldsmith's $21 billion offer for
Britain's BAT Industries PLC may set the agenda for Davis and other
investors.
   ``Europe now is where this country was in 1980,'' said John
Davis, 34.
   His father, 63, faces probable counteroffers for UAL by United's
pilots and the team of British Airways and the Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
investment firm.
   He declined to be interviewed. But in written responses to
questions from the Associated Press, he said the greatest threat to
the U.S. economy ``is in our failing to recognize that we are,
today, in a truly global economy.''
   ``American companies will have to be intensely competitive to
succeed in the years to come,'' Davis said. ``They will have to be
managed by the best trained and motivated people, provided with a
steady flow of capital and operate without any illusion about the
fact that we are no longer the pre-eminent force in many
industries.''
   Neither father nor son will reveal exactly where they are looking
next, though John Davis said newspapers, magazines, television
stations, and hotel-casino outfits can't be ruled out.
   At 6-foot-5 and about 300 pounds, Marvin Davis is known as a
fierce dealmaker and one of the world's wealthiest businessmen,
estimated to be worth $1.7 billion by Fortune magazine.
   He seems unlikely to lose the fascination with glamour industries
he has shown since cashing out of the oil business in the early '80s
just before the industry slumped.
   Davis was Denver's ``Mr. Wildcatter'' in the 1970s, paying huge
commissions to top geologists while convincing other oil companies
to absorb much of the risk and cost for the drilling.
   He purchased 20th Century Fox Film Corp. for $720 million, most
of it borrowed, with a partner in 1981, then bought singer Kenny
Rogers' Beverly Hills estate, ``The Knoll,'' for more than $20
million.
   Fox faltered under his leadership, partly because of flops like
``Rhinestone'' (Dolly Parton teamed with Sylvester Stallone, who
played a singing New York cab driver). But when Davis sold to Rupert
Murdoch after four years, he netted $325 million.
   Davis has unsuccessfully pursued such high-profile companies as
CBS Inc., Lorimar Telepictures Corp. and, this year, Northwest
Airlines parent NWA Inc. He teamed with Prudential Insurance Co. to
snag Spectradyne Inc., a big provider of pay-per-view movies in
hotel rooms, for $635 million.
   He paid $136 million to the family of now-convicted speculator
Ivan Boesky in December 1986 to buy the Beverly Hills Hotel, the
pink landmark where he had honeymooned with his wife, Barbara.
Within a year, he sold the hotel to the Sultan of Brunei, the
world's wealthiest person, for a $65 million profit.
   Although Davis generally avoids the press, he seems to have a
hankering for Hollywood happenings and celebrity friends.
   When he opened his Beverly Hills version of New York's Carnegie
Deli in July, George Burns, Milton Berle, John Madden and Wayne
Gretzky watched as Carol Channing plopped a monster matzo ball into
a vat of chicken soup.
   John Davis acknowledges the family won't be looking much at
industries ``unless they are fun.''
   ``We probably won't buy a chemical company,'' he said.
   At any given time, Davis' group is analyzing two or three
industries where undervalued companies may be found, John Davis said.
   He said the airline industry was targeted because it had
stabilized after the trauma of deregulation. The Davis group
especially liked United and Northwest because of their strength in
the booming Pacific Rim region.
   More often than not, Davis has profited enormously by buying
stock in a company, making a buyout offer that raises the price,
then selling his stake to a higher bidder.
   For example, he initially offered $2.7 billion to buy NWA but
eventually was outbid by investor Alfred Checchi's $3.65 billion
deal in June. Davis made $30 million.
   But John Davis insists the Davises seriously want to buy when
they bid, and bid only after rigorous analysis.
   ``We've spent too much time and effort on the airlines industry _
2{ years of work and millions and millions and millions of dollars
worth of bank fees, consultant fees, investment banking fees, legal
fees,'' he said.
   ``You know we wouldn't have spent all this money if we were just
interested in putting a company in play and making a profit.''
   Likewise, Marvin Davis counters critics who say he and other
takeover strategists are motivated by greedy speculation rather than
long-term investment goals.
   ``We are businessmen and builders,'' Davis said. ``We started
with an industrial base, building and developing a major oil and gas
exploration company. The companies we have bought _ for example
Aspen Skiing Co. and the Pebble Beach Co. _ have been expanded and
enhanced under our ownership. ...
   ``Equally important, our companies are contributing citizens of
the communities in which they operate _ from a philanthropic, social
and economic point of view,'' he said.
   Davis' own philanthropy is extensive. He established the
Children's Diabetes Foundation in Denver and the lavish Carousel
Ball that supports it. His donations to the foundation, the Barbara
Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, a geriatrics care facility in
Denver and a research center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles total tens of millions of dollars.
   But if his generosity has made many friends, his sharp business
instincts have, perhaps inevitably, bred conflict.
   Former 20th Century Fox chairman Dennis Stanfill resigned soon
after Davis bought Fox, claiming interference. He filed a $40
million breach-of-contract suit, later settled out of court.
   A suit pending in Houston federal court alleges Davis cheated
investors out of $40 million by taking leftover drilling supplies
from their oil wells. In a fraud suit pending in Denver federal
court, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. claims Davis misrepresented energy
properties in which Aetna had invested.
   Davis has called the suits ``fallacious and without merit.''
   Through it all, nothing seems to dampen the optimism that
motivated him in his wildcatter days. Friends say Davis and his wife
love Hollywood, where they remain on what's known as the social
``A-list.'' Linda Evans, Gregory Peck and Milton Berle attended
their Christmas party last year.
   ``I think he's really enjoying this new episode in his life,''
said former President Gerald Ford, a longtime family friend,
investor and golf partner.
   Ford noted that Davis' business instinct boils over onto the golf
links, where they compete for ``a couple of dollars here and there.''

   This is one of a series of periodic reports
looking ahead to Western Europe in 1992, when the 12 nations of the
European Economic Community remove their trade barriers and
interlock their policies and goals.

   The European Economic Community is fast
shedding its role as solely a trading bloc of West European nations
to assume a more prominent place in foreign affairs.
   The dozen nations that make up the community, also known as the
Common Market, are virtually certain to take more political stands
as their economies become tightly linked at the end of 1992,
analysts say.
   That may well mean a diminished role for the United States in
Europe and perhaps beyond, they say.
   ``It's a bit inevitable that where the United States was once the
only and therefore dominant initiator and influence in these
matters, it will be an equal or one of many nations,'' said Richard
Fieldhouse, research fellow at the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute in Sweden.
   Encouraging the European closeness is the drive by the EEC to
remove by Dec. 31, 1992, the many trade barriers separating the
members.
   The aim of 1992 is to create a single market in which people,
money, goods and services can move freely among member nations
Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
   The 12 nations, with a whopping 320 million consumers, can wield
much more economic power together than individually _ so too in
world affairs.
   ``The completion of the internal market will undoubtedly have
external implications,'' said Willy De Clercq, who formerly was the
community's top foreign affairs official.
   ``The object of the game is not just economic integration,'' said
Peter Ludlow, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a
Brussels-based think tank. ``(It) is only part of a general design
to create a European union.''
   ``Some measure of greater political cooperation will be had. .. .
How and to what degree all depends on the shape of economic
integration,'' said Alfred Kingon, the former U.S. ambassador to the
EEC.
   A recent poll by the European Commission, the community's
executive body, indicated that 72 percent of the Europeans
questioned felt the community should handle foreign policy issues. A
little more than half said it should also decide security and
defense matters.
   ``You can't exclude closer cooperation in security questions if
you really want to realize a United States of Europe,'' said Charles
Goerens, president of the legislative arm of the Western European
Union, a forum for foreign and defense ministers that discusses
security issues.
   With their unity push, Western Europeans are gaining a stronger
sense of identity and becoming less dependent on the United States,
long their protector against a possible threat from the Soviet Union.
   The United States appears more willing, at least to analysts on
this side of the Atlantic Ocean, to give up its once-supreme
position in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western
military alliance.
   They point in part to increased grumbling in the U.S. Congress
that Americans are paying too much _ and Europeans not enough _ of
the costs for the common Western defense. With the federal budget
crunch, there will be more pressure to pare the U.S. contribution.
   They also note President Bush's endorsement of the European
bonding.
   ``Let me say clearly a stronger Europe, a more united Europe, is
good for my country,'' he said in a July speech in the Netherlands.
``And it's a development we welcome, a natural evolution within our
alliance, the product of true partnership 40 years in the making.''
   The community's world standing got an unexpected lift in July
when Bush and leaders of other rich democracies put it in charge of
coordinating economic aid for Poland and Hungary.
   The move, which delighted community officials, was seen as a sign
of their growing importance.
   ``It was a brilliant stroke on the part of the United States,''
said Kingon.
   Community spokesman Claus-Dieter Ehlermann said the assignment
was ``certainly the biggest boost and also the greatest challenge''
for the EEC in foreign relations.
   ``We have never been charged (before) with coordinating the
activities of countries outside the 12.''

   Officials of two dozen Western nations met in Brussels in early
August to take an initial look at ways to help Poland and Hungary.
The talks produced pledges of emergency food aid to shortage-plagued
Poland. More discussions will be held in the fall.
   The community was given the job most likely because of its
contacts with the East. It has shown a keen interest in taking
advantage of the changes under way in its East bloc neighbors to
strengthen economic and political ties.
   In June 1988, it signed a declaration establishing official
relations with the Soviet-led economic bloc, called the Council for
Mutual Economic Assistance, also known by the acronym Comecon. It
brought to an end three decades of estrangement between Europe's
economic halves.
   Since then, the EEC has signed or initialed trade agreements with
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Negotiations are under way with
the Soviet Union and Bulgaria.
   At a summit in June, the leaders of the 12 member countries made
known their desire to play an active role in encouraging reforms in
Eastern Europe.
   They also acted together to sanction China for its crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators and urged a negotiated solution to the
Middle East conflict.
   Earlier in the year, they recalled their ambassadors from Iran to
protest the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's appeal for the death of
the author Salman Rushdie, who holds British citizenship.
   That action was agreed on at a regular monthly meeting of foreign
ministers, gatherings that have become an important feature of
community life.
   The governments also coordinate their views by issuing
statements, under the title European Political Cooperation, on the
troubles of the day, whether in Burma in Asia or the Middle East. A
tiny EPC office, opened in Brussels in 1987, issues about four or
five statements a month.
   ``The 12 have a common position in almost every single problem in
the world,'' said one community official.
   Yet, it's unclear how much farther the community can go.
   Further steps might be limited if neutral Austria, bridging the
East and the West in Europe, were to join. In a recent letter
applying for membership, the Austrian government insisted on
safeguarding its neutrality.
   Even so, the Soviet Union has expressed concern. EEC membership
would not be exclusively economic, the Kremlin said.
   Ireland, which entered the community in 1973, also is neutral.
Its status has not yet been troublesome, although it might be were
the community to expand forcefully into defense and security
matters. Ireland, unlike other community members, does not belong to
NATO.
   The Western European Union was revived in 1984 to bring together
European foreign and defense ministers to tackle security issues.
Defense chiefs do not meet within the EEC.
   Acting through the union in 1987, the nations sent naval
minesweeping forces to the Persian Gulf in the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``We have to become the European pillar of NATO,'' said Goerens,
who is also a Luxembourg legislator.
   Belgium, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands are members of the organization. Spain and Portugal will
join shortly. All belong to NATO.

<HEAD>Back to School: Beefing Up Security to Curb Violence, Protect Computers</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   More guards, high-tech security devices and drug-sniffing dogs
will greet children in urban and rural schools alike this fall as
officials struggle to curb spreading violence and vandalism.
   Security budgets have doubled, even tripled in many districts in
recent years, and now total in the hundreds of millions of dollars
nationwide, a 50-state check by The Associated Press found.
   New York City alone, with its 1,000 schools and nearly 1 million
pupils, will spend $60 million on security this coming school year,
double what it spent eight years ago. Los Angeles, the second
largest district, spends $26 million.
   The spending relates not just to weapons, gangs and drugs, but
also to the high-tech revolution that has loaded schools with VCRs
and computers that need protection.
   ``The more we get into computers and things of that sort,
equipment that is really expensive, naturally we want to protect
that,'' said Billy Randall, assistant superintendent of the
Greenwood Public Schools in Greenwood, Miss., which recently
installed sophisticated burglar alarms.
   Some districts still insist school life is as peaceful as ever.
   ``We have none of those kinds of problems you read about in the
big cities,'' said Joe Zema, attorney for the Topeka, Kan., school
district where security isn't even an identifiable item in the
budget.
   But elsewhere, drug and gang problems are finally forcing
formerly placid school districts to hire guards and install
sophisticated security hardware. Some officials now worry that such
measures may make their schools feel like prisons or armed camps.
   Bill Hanebuth, head of the Mobile, Ala., County Education
Association, called it ``a little unnerving'' to think local schools
might resemble New York's or Chicago's. But with 15 teachers
assaulted by students last school year, he and other Alabamians seem
to agree sterner security measures are in order.
   ``It's gotten beyond the day of just the fire drill. We've got to
be prepared for the extreme because that's what we face,'' said Max
Joiner, executive director of the Alabama Council for School
Administration and Supervision which began security workshops last
year.
   ``We're deliberately trying to avoid letting our schools become
armed camps,'' said A.C. Boyd, director of security for New Orleans'
schools, which nonetheless will add a drug-sniffing dog this year to
its arsenal of hand-held metal detectors, top-of-the-line locks,
high fences and burglar alarms.
   No figures exist on how much the nation's schools spend each year
on security. But a check of districts in all 50 states found the
figure is certainly in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   ``We do know that the trend is up, and it's related to drug
activity and gangs, and possession of weapons,'' said Ronald D.
Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center at
Pepperdine University.
   The Dade County school district, which includes Miami, will spend
$10.3 million on security for the 1989-90 school year, about $1.8
million more than last year, and $4 million more than five years
ago, said Red McAllister, director of investigations.
   Philadelphia will spend $10.4 million, nearly double the $5.5
million spent in the 1983-84 school year.
   Boston will spend $2.2 million on safety this school year and may
start using metal detectors, said school committee member John Nucci.
   ``We have real concerns for this coming school year. The gang
problem and guns on the street find their way to the schools,''
Nucci said.
   Ninety-seven percent of New York City's $60 million school
security budget is for guards, said Bruce Irushalmi, director of the
office of school safety. The city also plans to introduce metal
detectors into 15 schools, up from five.
   Fairfax County, Va., where a third-grader was raped last year,
has hired eight new security employees and will issue photo IDs to
all elementary and intermediate staff who travel to schools.
   Chicago's school system, the nation's third largest, spends $12.5
million a year and has 723 security positions.
   The Muskogee, Okla., district hired two part-time security guards
last year for about $30,000 after a student with a handgun
accidentally wounded a fellow student in a high school class.
   Little Rock, Ark., officials say they plan to raise the profile
of security officers and possibly use a drug-sniffing dog following
last year's shooting death of a student on a junior high basketball
court.
   Officials insist all this spending is creating safer, more secure
schools.
   Daryl R. Harrell, school security director of Albuquerque, N.M.,
said vandalism losses dropped from $500,000 to $80,000 with the help
of an electronic surveillance alarm system.
   In Jefferson County, Colo., which includes Denver, school
officials claim burglaries and vandalism have declined by 50 percent
since the installation of state-of-the-art security systems
featuring motion detectors.
   In New York City, Irushalmi says the number of violent or serious
incidents has decreased from 15,500 to 9,000 since security spending
doubled.
   Some argue still more spending is needed as gang violence and the
crack epidemic spread.
   ``Many districts are not getting new money to handle these
issues. Yet more and more is being asked of us,'' said Peter
Blauvelt, school security chief of Prince Georges County, Md., and
president of the National Association of School Security Directors.
   Clark County, Nev., which includes Las Vegas, wanted to raise
property taxes to increase its school security staff from 22 to 40
officers following a school year marred by gang violence, the murder
of a high school student and the rape and kidnapping of a
12-year-old elementary school pupil. The state Legislature refused
to put the measure to the voters.
   ``I cannot for the life of me understand why a Legislature would
be unwilling to let the people of a county vote on whether they
wanted to raise the money to pay for the safety of kids,'' said
Clark County School Board President Dan Newburn.
   Ed McFadden, security chief in Mobile County, Ala., said he is
seeking a $150,000 increase in the $430,000 security budget to put
unarmed guards in high schools.
   ``Our biggest concern in campus security is how to keep students
from bringing guns to school,'' McFadden said. In 1988-89, 146
students were suspended for weapons possession, including 30 cases
involving guns.
   Milwaukee's school security budget has doubled in five years to
$1 million and will rise by $300,000 in 1989-90, said safety
director Gerald Mourning. New this year: security systems to protect
cars from theft and vandalism, and closed circuit TV monitors in 15
elementary schools in high- crime areas.
   Beyond guards and hardware, Seattle and Milwaukee are offering
``anger management classes'' to teach youngsters alternatives to
violence. The course was tested last year in four Milwaukee schools
and will expand this year to four to six more.

   The Greenwood, S.C., school district has spent $90,000 to install
intercoms and a fence around an elementary school where an intruder
last year shot and killed two third-graders and wounded seven other
students and two teachers.
   Weapons, drug-related violence, thefts and gang problems have
spread to small-town schools, leading authorities to try the same
high-tech security hardware inner-city schools rely on, a 50-state
Associated Press survey has found.
   ``We have to be conscious of security in small districts, a lot
more than we used to be,'' said superintendent Luis Montoya in
Clifton, Ariz., where a rash of break-ins forced the district to
triple its security outlays in the last five years.
   The effort is mainly to protect new VCRs, computers, tape
recorders and camera equipment. Another problem is siphoning of
gasoline from school buses.
   In central Michigan, the Mason school district spends about
$3,000 a year on motion detector equipment to protect computers at
the middle and high schools.
   ``Compared to five years ago, we didn't have that kind of
equipment. We didn't have that volume of computer equipment to
protect,'' said superintendent Glenn Doran.
   The 1,900-student Perryton Independent School District in the
Texas panhandle pays about $5,000 a year for drug-sniffing dogs and
$250 for security lighting. So far, those measures haven't turned up
much, spokesman Randy Barnes acknowledged.
   ``We found a pill once that looked pretty suspicious, but it
turned out to be a Contac capsule,'' he said.
   In Yankton, S.D., school authorities prefer a hard line on school
crime to security hardware.
   A 15-year-old boy convicted of making a false bomb threat wound
up serving time at the State Training School, and an 18-year-old was
sentenced to one year in the Yankton Detention Center for a similar
threat.
   Not every rural school is worried.
   Several years ago, in an incident that drew national attention,
an armed gunman took an entire school of children hostage in
Cokeville, Wyo. But state superintendent Lynn Simons said the
incident was an aberration and it didn't change his approach to
security.
   ``We can rest easy in Wyoming. We just don't have to worry about
those problems,'' said Simons.
   In Eatonville, Wash., high school principal Randy Dorn knows his
kids sometimes bring weapons to school _ but he says it's only
during hunting season.

   A final rule, to be published Monday in the Federal Register and

   That rule had rarely been enforced and the commission had voted

   The FTC began reviewing its earlier rule in 1984 and determined

<HEAD>Canadian Affiliates of Ernst &amp; Whinney To Merge With Peat Marwick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian affiliates of the U.S. accounting
firm Ernst &amp; Whinney have spurned a merger with Arthur Young &amp; Co.
and joined up instead with another firm.
   Thorne Ernst &amp; Whinney and Peat Marwick said Thursday they had
agreed to merge into a firm to be called Peat Marwick Thorne.
   Accounting industry analysts had said the Canadian partners of
Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young were among the few holdouts against
the worldwide merger announced in May.
   The two firms had agreed to combine in a firm with worldwide
revenue of $4.2 billion and domestic revenue of $2 billion. That
deal _ which was approved by most of the firms' worldwide partners _
is completed and the new firm, Ernst &amp; Young, formally begins
operations Oct. 1.
   The new Canadian accounting firm will have offices in 61 cities
across the country with 800 partners and 5,600 employees, the firms
said in a statement.
   Combined annual revenue based on 1988 figures is 439 million
Canadian dollars, ahead of the 379 million Canadian dollars for
another pair of companies that have also proposed a merger,
Deloitte-Samson and Touche Ross.
   Peat Marwick's clients in Canada include Campeau Corp., Xerox's
Canadian operations and the developing giant, Bramalea Ltd. Thorne
brings such firms as Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc., the Bank of
Canada and Thomson Newspapers to the partnership.
   The two Toronto-based accounting giants also agreed to merge
their consulting arms, which provide expertise on such matters as
corporate mergers and acquisitions.
   The new consulting partnership will be known as Peat Marwick
Stevenson and Kellogg.
   The two firms' partners will be asked to approve the mergers
within two weeks.

<HEAD>Ericsson and GE to Form Mobile Communications Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. and Sweden's L.M. Ericsson
announced they will form a joint venture in mobile communications
that they expect to have sales of $1 billion next year.
   The new company will be owned 60 percent by Ericsson and 40
percent by GE. It will produce cellular telephones and other kinds
of mobile radio equipment, including data communications systems.
   No money will change hands in the deal, the companies said
Thursday. The combination requires government approvals, which are
expected to be granted routinely.
   Ericsson, one of the world's largest telecommunications
companies, is the world leader in the sales of switches and base
stations for cellular telephone systems, with a world market share
it estimates at 40 percent and a U.S. market share of about 25
percent. It has a smaller share of the market for the phones
themselves.
   General Electric, despite its overall revenue of more than $50
billion a year, is a smaller force in telecommunications. It makes
cellular phones but not the cellular equipment. It also makes mobile
radio equipment such as police radios, mostly in Lynchburg, Va.
   The deal will benefit both companies by giving them access to
each other's markets, and GE should gain from Ericsson's commitment
to research and development, especially in the coming generation of
digital cellular radio, said Herschel Shosteck, an analyst in Silver
Spring, Md.
   ``GE was skimping on the necessary research and development
dollars,'' Shosteck said.
   GE spokesman Bruce Bunch said the company spends heavily on R&amp;D
but acknowledged that Ericsson is ``the clear leader'' in digital
cellular radio.
   Ericsson will contribute operations employing 2,200 people in the
United States, Canada and Europe, while General Electric will
contribute operations with 2,300 people, most of them in Lynchburg.
   Ake Lundqvist of Ericsson has been named president of the
venture, which will be named Ericsson-GE Mobile Communications.
   Ericsson's contribution will be made up of units in Richardson,
Texas, and Montreal that are involved in cellular phone systems and
mobile communications, as well as units in Sweden that work on land
mobile radio and mobile data and mobile telephones.
   Ericsson will also contribute sales companies in Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, Finland and Spain. All its employees will stay where they
are.
   General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., will contribute
units that produce mobile radio and cellular telephone equipment in
the United States and Canada. The GE employees also will stay where
they are. Most are in Lynchburg.

<HEAD>Looks Like a Domino's, But Radisson Hotels Deliver Own Pizza in Disguise</HEAD>

   You're staying at a Radisson hotel and craving
pizza. You spot a card on the nightstand advertising pizza delivery.
A call brings a piping-hot pie to the door delivered by a person
wearing what appears to be a pizza chain's outfit.
   It isn't.
   Though hotel guests might assume they are ordering pizza from an
outlet outside the hotel, such as Domino's or Pizza Hut, they're
not. The pizza is baked in the same hotel kitchen that makes regular
room-service orders and is delivered by a room service employee
disguised as a pizza delivery person.
   Why the subterfuge?
   Don Clawson, vice president of food services for Radisson Hotels
International, said the hotels had to overcome the perception among
travelers that a room-service pizza isn't as good as one from a
pizza parlor. So the company decided to pattern its pizza delivery
on Domino's.
   ``To be perfectly honest, we don't tell the customer it's from
room service,'' said Clawson. ``If they ask, we would tell them. We
are not dishonest about it. If they don't ask, we don't tell them.''
   Radisson developed the in-house pizza idea in 1985 after company
President John Norlander noticed the number of empty Domino's boxes
lining the halls of a Radisson hotel during a company business
conference.
   The Minneapolis-based hotel chain's in-house pizza delivery
service used to be called ``Pizza...We Deliver!'' The pizza was
offered through room service, and sales were disappointing, Clawson
said.
   Radisson's new pizza service is named ``Napolizza ... The Pizza
With Pizzazz,'' after the Italian city of Napoli, which claims to be
the birthplace of pizza. The Napolizza phone number is separate from
room service's and is listed prominently among pizza delivery
services in the room's telephone directory.
   Radisson room service employees who deliver pizza wear a nylon
jacket, baseball cap and polo shirt emblazoned with the Napolizza
logo. The pie is delivered in a pizza box or in a ``hot wrap,'' a
thermal insulated carrying case.
   Like Domino's, the Napolizza pizza comes with discount coupons
for future purchases. The pizza is delivered within 29 minutes or
it's free _ one minute less than Domino's 30-minute delivery
guarantee.
   Not everyone is fooled by the illusion, Clawson said.
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that hotels
don't allow free-standing restaurants to advertise (in the rooms)
very often,'' he said.
   About 45 of the 110 U.S. Radisson hotels offer the service,
Clawson said. Sales average 40-45 pizzas daily per hotel, almost 2{
times the number sold under Radisson's old program, and Domino's
sales at the hotels have been cut significantly, he said.
   A ``good many'' of the 1,400 Holiday Inns in the United States
have an in-house pizza program, but there's no attempt to disguise
the pizza's origin, said Ginny Troutt, a spokeswoman for the
Memphis-based chain.
   ``We noticed a lot of pizza boxes in guest rooms,'' she said.
``We thought, why not offer a pizza?''
   Ron Hingst, a spokesman for Domino's Pizza Inc. of Ann Arbor,
Mich., said the company isn't concerned about being imitated.
   ``We wish them luck. Imitation's the best form of flattery,''
Hingst said, adding that Domino's hasn't noticed an impact on sales
at hotels that offer in-house pizzas.

<HEAD>Integrated Sets Tentative Agreement For $310 Million Asset Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Integrated Resources Inc., a struggling financial
services company, says it has reached a tentative agreement to sell
part of its holdings for $310 million to the family-owned Whitehall
Financial Group partnership.
   The price is about $20 million to $30 million below the low end
of the range that Integrated Resources executives had predicted to
creditors that the assets might fetch, Arthur Goldberg, Integrated's
co-chief executive, said Thursday in an interview.
   Nevertheless, Goldberg said he believed the announcement showed
that Integrated Resources was taking credible steps toward raising
money to make payments on its $1.75 billion in debt.
   Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to creditors
since June, when it declared a moratorium because of deepening
financial troubles.
   Integrated said last week it would try to sell its core financial
service companies for $450 million to $525 million, but Whitehall
was interested in only part of the holdings, Goldberg said.
   Since the offer came in below projections, Integrated said it
would continue to solicit bidders for them, but would pay Whitehall
a $4 million breakup fee if their deal was dropped. Goldberg said
other parties are interested in the parts of the business Whitehall
did not want, Goldberg said.
   Whitehall is half owned by members of the de Gunzburg branch of
the Bronfman family of Canada, heirs to the Seagram Ltd. distilling
fortune, and half by the Moross family of London, which has
extensive financial services interests. Whitehall has holdings in
life insurance and property and casualty brokerage.
   Whitehall would buy Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co.,
Integrated Resources Equity Corp., Integrated Resources Asset
Management Corp., Resources Trust Co., and Financial Clearing and
Services Corp.
   The sale price would be $297 million, plus a portion of tax
benefits received by the core companies after the sale that would
raise the total purchase price to $310 million.
   Whitehall would not buy Integrated's Capitol Life Insurance Co.,
its tax-sheltered annuity business, its ordinary life insurance
business or United Resources.
   After the spinoff of subsidiaries, Integrated's main business
would be management of existing public and private limited
partnerships and real estate investment trusts.

   Stock market analysts say the risk of a financial
meltdown is far lower today than it was two years ago, the last time
the Dow Jones industrial average was in record territory.
   A 56.53-point leap in the Dow Jones average Thursday carried it
to 2,734.64, surpassing the record of 2,722.42 that was set
precisely two years ago today.
   The 1987 peak was the start of a short but severe bear market
that culminated in the worst day in Wall Street history, the
508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials on Oct. 19, 1987.
   Evidence of that debacle was hard to find Thursday.
   ``The quote of the day is something like: What crash?'' said
Robert Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc., the New York arm of a Japanese brokerage firm.
   Supporting the stock market in 1989 are a healthy dollar,
relatively low interest rates and optimism that the economy will
manage to steer a middle course between recession and high inflation.
   Most of all, there is no speculative bubble ready to be popped.
Stock prices are far lower in relation to underlying company profits
than they were two years ago, said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist
at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   ``Fundamentally this is a great expression of confidence in the
whole U.S. economic outlook,'' Kudlow said. ``We keep throwing
negatives at the market and they don't stick.''
   Added David M. Jones, chief economist at the brokerage firm
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., ``Essentially the stock market is telling
us that a soft landing is in store for the economy, and that's
exactly the slowdown you need to keep inflation from accelerating,''
   While some other strategists are more skeptical about the
economy's health, a market rally can sometimes feed on itself
regardless of fundamental factors.
   ``The worst thing that can happen to an institutional money
manager is to sit there with a pile of cash and watch the market
take off with out him. It's a buying panic,'' said Lawrence R.
Helfand, managing director for retail sales at the Chicago brokerage
Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   Thursday's gain was the second-biggest of the year, and it came
in the heaviest trading since mid-June, a good sign for the market.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 225.52 million shares.
   There was no economic news Thursday to account for the big jump.
Bonds were up slightly and the dollar edged higher.
   ``The market's going up just on its own. When you call around,
there's no reason. It just went up,'' Brusca said.
   From its low point at the close of Black Monday to its close
Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average, which represents the
stock of 30 major companies, rose 57 percent.
   ``While nobody's paid much attention to it, it's two of the
strongest years, back to back, that we've had,'' Helfand said.

   Fixed-rate mortgage rates rose to a national
average of 9.85 percent this month after dropping in July to their
lowest level in more than two years, according to a survey by the
Federal National Mortgage Association.
   Fannie Mae said Thursday the new average for 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages rose from 9.73 last month, the lowest level since
fixed-rate morgages averaged 9.25 percent in March 1987.
   The rates for one-year adjustable mortgages, meanwhile, fell to
8.51 percent from 8.66 percent in July.
   Because of generally declining rates, homebuyers have flocked to
fixed-rate mortgages recently. In July, the percentage of adjustable
rate mortgage applications fell to 19 percent, the lowest level
since April 1987, Fannie Mae said.

   Two years ago today, the New York Stock Exchange
closed at an all-time high. Two months later, the market crashed.
   The resurgent Dow Jones industrials average on Thursday finally
cracked its 1987 record but few if any market professionals believe
that history will repeat itself.
   ``You didn't have the euphoric buying all summer long'' this
year, said Peter Blatchford, a 27-year-old market maker on the
options floor. ``It's based on sound economic news. The economy is
stronger than people thought.''
   In stark contrast with the go-go days of Summer 1987, this year's
rise to new record highs has been slow and steady.
   ``Everyone knows what the monster looks like and they're looking
over their shoulders to see him,'' said Robert W. Seijas, a partner
in a stock exchange member firm.
   Traders spilled out of the exchange at Wall and New streets after
the closing bell Thursday as on any other day. But this time the Dow
Jones industrials average had finished at a record 2,734.64,
surpassing its reading of 2,722.42 on Aug. 25, 1987.
   The rise in the closely watched measure 30 key industrial company
stocks is considered the final symbolic sign on Wall Street of the
steady recovery since the 1987 crash, which saw the Dow plunge 508
points on Oct. 19, 1987. Other key indexes shattered record highs
earlier this summer.
   The Dow flirted with the record several times earlier this month,
breaking through the top number but ending the day lower.
   A subdued cheer rose from the exchange floor after the close
Thursday.
   ``A day like every other day _ no big deal,'' said Peter Mancuso,
a specialist with Albert Fried &amp; Co. ``There was no question in
everybody's mind that the market would get back to these levels. It
just needed some time.''
   Market players said the difference between 1987 and 1989 lies in
the economy's strength, with inflation apparently under control and
interest rates gradually heading lower _ the non-recessionary ``soft
landing'' many economists have been predicting.
   They did say cracking the old record was significant because, on
Wall Street, psychological barriers are important. Thanks to the
economy's strength, optimism remains the vanguard on the Street.
   ``The market seems to want to go higher,'' said Alfred Smith, a
specialist with A.C. Partners. ``The further away you get from the
crash, the better it is.''

<BYLINE>Bass Purchase of Holiday Inns Clears Path For Holiday's Other Chains</BYLINE>

   The proposed $2.2 billion sale of Holiday
Inns Inc. would make Bass PLC of Great Britain the world's largest
hotel manager and clear the way for parent Holiday Corp. to
concentrate on its casinos and newer hotel chains, market observers
say.
   Holiday Corp. ``is poised for substantial growth in their new
form and with a much better balance sheet,'' said Marvin Roffman, a
market analyst with the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery
Scott Inc.
   Holiday, the Memphis-based parent of Holiday Inns, announced the
proposed sale Thursday, prompting the company's stock to jump $6 a
share to close at $83 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The price received for the Holiday Inn brand was a very solid
valuation of about 13{ times pre-tax cashflow. That looks pretty
attractive considering it's a tax-free transaction to Holiday
Corp.,'' said John Lawrence, a market analyst with the brokerage
Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. of Memphis.
   The sale must be approved by shareholders of both companies.
Ralph Berry, a spokesman for Holiday Corp., said no dates have been
set for shareholder meetings to vote on the proposal.
   Holiday Corp. said it would form a new subsidiary to run its
profitable hotel-casino company, Harrah's, and its newer hotel
chains, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.
   ``It clearly focuses the company in the high-growth segments of
the hotel business,'' Roffman said.
   Holiday said its newer hotel brands have grown to the point that
they compete with Holiday Inn in the marketplace and for attention
within the corporation.
   Under the proposed sale agreement, Holiday stockholders would get
one-quarter share of Bass stock for each of their Holiday shares,
worth a total of about $125 million. They also would get a
$35-a-share dividend from the new Holiday subsidiary.
   In addition, they would get one share in the new subsidiary for
each of their Holiday shares, and Lawrence said that stock would be
worth $45 to $55 a share.
   The sale will allow Holiday Corp. to shed $2.1 billion in debt,
which will be assumed by Bass. Much of the debt stems from the
company's recapitalization in 1987, which allowed the company to pay
shareholders an extra dividend to ward of a takeover threat by New
York developer Donald J. Trump, Berry said.
   ``As a result of that, the new company when it's spun off will be
virtually debt-free. It will then borrow or finance new borrowing to
pay the dividend,'' he said.
   With the sale, Bass will acquire 55 owned or leased Holiday Inns
as well as franchise agreements, joint venture agreements and
management contracts covering about 1,400 other Holiday Inns in
North America.
   Last year, Bass bought the rights to franchise Holiday Inn hotels
outside North America and the company is a major franchisee in
Canada. Bass already owns 14 Holiday Inns in the southeast United
States.
   Bass has more than 7,300 pubs and other food and drink outlets in
the United Kingdom. The company also brews Bass, Carling Black Label
and other beers. It has annual sales approaching $6 billion.
   The British company is expected to keep Holiday Inn's North
American headquarters in Memphis, Berry said, and Holiday Corp.
employees now working for Holiday Inn will become Bass employees.

<HEAD>Fines Against Trader, Firm Sign Of Increased Policing, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fines totaling $550,000 against a top commodities
trader and his firm are a sign of increased internal policing in the
face of a federal investigation of New York's futures markets,
industry experts say.
   The Commodity Exchange on Thursday fined and suspended the
trader, Preston H. Semel, for violating trading rules. Semel is one
of the targets of the government's criminal and civil probes of New
York's commodity markets.
   ``It's a very large fine and it's probably making a statement
that what he did was bad and trying to tell the rest of Comex to be
careful,'' said Thomas Russo, a commodities lawyer and former
chairman of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The fines against Semel and Semel &amp; Co., a brokerage in gold,
silver and other commodities, were believed to be the largest in
exchange history, officials said.
   Semel was cited for internal trading rules violations that also
are being examined in civil and criminal probes at Comex and three
other exchanges announced in May by the CFTC and Justice Department.
   The probes are unrelated to a longstanding probe of Chicago's
commodity markets that recently yielded 46 indictments for
racketeering and fraud.
   A government official familiar with the New York investigations
confirmed Thursday that Semel is ``one of many'' traders whose
actions are being examined. The official, who asked not to be named,
said the probes include the same types of violations cited by Comex.
   More than 50 traders received subpoenas and federal authorities
are examining boxes of documents provided by the exchanges and
traders, defense lawyers said Thursday. No action in the federal
probe is expected for at least two months, lawyers said.
   The official familiar with the criminal probe said investigators
from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Postal
Service are examining documents subpoenaed by the CFTC.
   ``We've still got a while to go on the criminal case,'' the
official said.
   Comex spokesman Robert McGrath said Semel was fined $350,000 and
suspended for nine months from the exchange while Semel &amp; Co. was
fined $200,000.
   The violations by Semel involve improper cross-trading and
prohibited dual trading, two offenses that center on trading for
customers and personal accounts.
   Semel, 39, and his firm also were cited under exchange rules for
misconduct, disreputable or fraudulent conduct and conduct
detrimental to the exchange.
   Comex guidelines regarding the two stated trading violations bar
traders from taking the opposite side of an order received and from
trading for personal accounts while holding a customer's order for
the same commodity.
   Officials said the charges listed generally involve a practice
know as ``front-running'' _ getting an unfair advantage by trading
for personal accounts ahead of customer orders for the same
commodity. That pracice is under scrutiny in the federal probes.
   A person answering the telephone Thursday at Semel &amp; Co. said no
one would be available for comment.
   The CFTC probe reportedly examines violations including
pre-arranged trading, using advance knowledge of customer trades to
trade for personal accounts and conducting trades in order to skirt
tax obligations.
   The criminal probe reportedly includes examination of alleged
front-running at the exchanges and whether brokers and traders
illegally shared information with each other about customer orders.
   Comex issued a complaint against Semel _ a powerful figure on the
exchange floor _ in June 1988 for trading that took place before
then, McGrath said. He refused to release other details about the
internal probe.
   Semel was expected to appeal the penalty to the CFTC but
spokeswoman Kate Hathaway said he had not yet done so.
   In addition to the Comex, the government in May issued subpoenas
to the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange, and the Cotton Exchange.

<DATELINE>SCHOEPPINGEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young, healthy and hungry for a
new start in the West, thousands of newly arrived East German
refugees are snapping up blue-collar jobs spurned by West Germans.
   ``They won't have any trouble integrating themselves here,'' said
Olaf Sund, head of the North Rhine-Westphalia labor office, as he
surveyed hundreds of escapees filling out applications or scanning
job notices at the refugee reception center here.
   ``They are young, eager and in many cases well-trained,'' Sund
said. ``They were the future of East Germany.''
   More than 65,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany this
year, emigrating legally in record numbers and escaping through
Hungary's recently relaxed borders at a rate unequaled since 1961,
when the Berlin Wall staunched the last rush to the West.
   West Germany's main reception center in Giessen became so crowded
last week that officials opened a new post outside this village near
Muenster to handle the overflow.
   The Schoeppingen center opened less than a week ago, but word of
the willing workforce has spread fast.
   Hand-lettered signs offering manual-labor jobs are posted by the
dozens on the chain-link fences surrounding the barracks that on
Thursday housed 900 East Germans, nearly all of whom had escaped
illegally through Hungary.
   The more aggressive employers cruise by the camp in luxury cars
to offer a ride as well as a workplace. One woman in a Mercedes with
Cologne license plates said she was searching for a live-in maid.
   In Building No. 7 of the crowded but orderly encampment is a
makeshift branch of the state employment office. Neat rows of job
notices offer immediate work for plumbers, cooks, roofers, painters
and other tradesmen.
   ``It makes no difference to me where I go to work,'' said
Burkhard Schmidt, a printer from Dresden bused here two days ago
after a harrowing escape with his family that twice landed him in
Hungarian jails. ``I just want to get a place to live and get my
family settled.''
   Wolfgang Handschuch of the regional employment office in nearby
Coesfeld said nearly 200 jobs had been called in to the camp during
each of the past few days.
   The eager offerings from employers who have long sought manual
laborers, as well as the urgency felt by escapees who want to get
started in new jobs, has resulted in a chaotic match-making system.
   Handschuch said the handful of government labor advisers at the
camp can do little to verify either the prospective employee's
qualifications or the employer's working conditions.
   ``There are some people who come here with expectations of the
Golden West, where everyone immediately has a job, a car and a
beautiful home,'' Handschuch said. ``But I would say most are
realistic about their chances.''
   Ingrid Meyer, a 44-year-old Magdeburg resident who ran a
restaurant until she applied to emigrate four years ago, said she
was confident she and her husband would be settled soon.
   ``There are so many jobs for food service people here. We hadn't
expected such a wealth of choice,'' she said.
   East Germans are more easily assimilated in West Germany than
their East bloc neighbors because of the common language and
relative familiarity with Western lifestyles. West German TV can be
seen in most parts of East Germany.
   The transition is tougher for ethnic Germans emigrating from the
Soviet Union and Poland.
   Harry Meisel, head of the labor department in Baden-Wuerttemberg
state, said his office placed a Soviet chef who couldn't adjust to
the restaurant's supplies. Language problems aside, he had seldom
worked with more than salt and pepper for seasonings.
   Many East German immigrants have insufficient education or
experience to go directly into their fields, especially in
computer-related work, said Andreas Mausch, spokesman for the
federal Labor Ministry in Bonn.
   ``But in the long term, with some additional training, the
outlook is very good,'' he said. ``These people want to stay here
and build careers.''
   Mausch said there were more than 255,000 jobs open in blue-collar
fields that employers had called in to state employment offices.
   ``Obviously there are a great many others that we don't even know
about,'' he said.
   Signs offering waitress or janitorial work can be seen in the
windows of shops in virtually every West German city, as even young
West Germans resist jobs that are menial or low-paying.
   The nation's 2 million jobless _ more than 8 percent _ are mostly
skilled workers in depressed fields such as steel-making,
shipbuilding and coal mining, and the generous social welfare system
discourages them from switching to other trades.
   Mausch said East Germans with experience in electrical work,
engineering and personal services such as hairdressing were in high
demand in West Germany.
   Workers in all fields are in severe shortage in East Germany,
which has encouraged the communist leadership to retain tight
restrictions on Western travel and emigration despite widespread
public pressure for reform.
   Many of the Schoeppingen refugees, who stay here an average of
three or four days before setting out for resettlement, said they
left illegally because they knew they would never be allowed to
emigrate.
   ``We are exactly the kind of people the state doesn't want to
leave,'' observed one woman, who did not want her name used. Smiling
sardonically, she nodded toward the crush of young families and
added: ``This must really be killing the authorities at home.''

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Restructures To Capture More of Market</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup. Co is phasing out operations
at its oldest manufacturing plant _ a sign that the food industry
giant is moving ahead with aggressive plans to garner a larger share
of the $2 billion soup market.
   A decade ago, corporate brass at the nation's largest soup maker
balked at the thought of laying off workers at antiquated plants
operating at less than capacity.
   It took 18 months to close an obsolete facility in Chicago
because company Chairman John Dorrance Jr., the son of the inventor
of condensed soup, hated to lay workers off.
   ``Ten years ago they acted very paternalistically,'' said Marvin
B. Roffman, an analyst at the Philadelphia brokerage firm Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc.
   Acting on results from a 3-year study of Campbell's operations,
the company announced Thursday a worldwide restructuring that will
include the loss of 2,800 jobs and the closure of the 120-year-old
manufacturing plant at its headquarters here and plants in Maryland
and Tennessee.
   The reorganization, approved at a board of directors' meeting
Thursday, is expected to save the company almost $15 million during
its fiscal 1990 and about $150 million over the next four years,
said Campbell spokeswoman Marsha Cade.
   The restructuring is expected to produce a one-time charge of
about $344 million, or $2.01 a share, against earnings for the 1989
fiscal year, the company said.
   Production at the Camden plant would be moved to other canned
food plants in Napoleon, Ohio, Paris, Texas and Maxton, N.C., the
company said. The plant manufactures Campbell's soups,
Franco-American pasta, beans and Prego spaghetti sauce.
   The plant, which opened in the company's first year of existence
in 1869, will be closed by July 1990, eliminating 940 jobs. The
plant, though large, is inefficient because of its eight-story
layout.
   Also slated for closure are a 272-employee plant in Pocomoke
City, Md., a 246-worker plant in Crisfield, Md., and an 84-employee
plant in Smyrna, Tenn.
   Five more plants with a total of 1,200 workers will be closed at
a later, unspecified date, company officials said.
   ``We feel that this will make Campbell more efficient,'' Ms. Cade
said. ``Their time has passed them by and they just aren't efficient
as they should be.''
   Many of the employees will be offered transfers and others will
be offered severance pay or aid in finding other jobs, Campbell said.
   The company said it plans to maintain its headquarters in this
poor city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Plans are
underway to begin construction later this year on a $35 million,
200,000-square-foot international headquarters on the city's
waterfront.
   Company officials said the 1,700 headquarters employees will not
be affected by the plant closing.
   Restructuring also is expected at some of the company's foreign
plants, Ms. Cade said. Campbell has about 100 processing plants
scattered around the world, including about 60 in the United States.
   The board already approved capital expenditures of $430 million
for fiscal 1990 to upgrade plants, Campbell said.
   ``It's really a statement that management is making that we're
going to be lean and mean,'' said Roffman. ``Any food company who
wants to be independent in the `90s had better be a very low-cost
producer with a global presence.''
   The restructuring comes as little surprise, Roffman said.
   ``Two years ago the company told the world they planned to be
(on) top,'' Roffman said. ``This is just moving that program into
super-high gear.''
   Since 1986, the company has phased out plants in Chicago,
Pottstown and Doylestown, Pa., and Memphis, Mich., under the
program, Ms. Cade said.
   Before his death in April, Dorrance began to recognize that the
industry was moving toward consolidated, state-of-the-art
operations, Roffman said.
   Campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year, garnering
about 65 percent of the $2.2 billion retail soup market, a drop of
about 5 percent in the past five years. The company also has had
difficulty breaking into the faster-growing dry-soup market.

   The dollar firmed slightly in quiet European
trading today but traders said the market lacked a fundamental
direction. Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market was quiet because most
players were unwilling to take new positions before the weekend and
there was a lack of economic news.
   The next important U.S. economic figures are revised
second-quarter gross national product figures due out Tuesday.
   ``It is really impossible to detect a trend,'' said a trader in
Rome. ``The market is very quiet and lackluster.''
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5670 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers than $1.5698 dollars
late Thursday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.9620 West German marks, up from
1.9585; 1.6920 Swiss francs, up from 1.6880; 6.6145 French francs,
up from 6.6060; 2.2127 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2095; 1,408.50
Italian lire, up from 1,406.75; 1.1745 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1765.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.07 yen to a closing 143.53 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 143.72 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $362.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $362.75. At mid-morning, the city's
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $361.15.
   In Zurich, gold traded at a bid $360.85 compared with $362.00
late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.64 to close at a bid $362.11.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce, compared with
Thursday's $5.17.

   The dollar edged down against the yen today, while
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed lower.
   The dollar closed at 143.53 yen, down 0.07 yen from Thursday's
close of 143.60. The dollar started the day at 143.38 yen, and moved
in a range of 143.33-143.63 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 106.73-point loser Thursday, lost 46.62 points today to
close marginally lower at 34,739.93.
   Currency dealers said trading was light and directionless.
``Japanese customers were staying on the sidelines,'' said Minori
Takeuchi, a trader at Chemical Bank.
   The resignation of Chief Cabinet Secretary Tokuo Yamashita today
did not have a major impact on currency markets, Takeuchi said.
   Yamashita announced he would resign after apologizing for an
extramarital affair with a bar hostess.
   ``Usually it would have an impact on the market, but the market
didn't move because many Japanese institutions had long dollar
positions and couldn't buy on the upside of the dollar,'' Takeuchi
said.
   On the stock market, prices were dampened by concerns about
interest rates, said a dealer at brokerage Kleinwort Benson who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Because domestic consumption and economic growth look like they
may be stronger this quarter than earlier expected, ``the market is
having to sit up and take notice of what's happening with interest
rates,'' he said.
   The effect of Yamashita's resignation was ``minimal,'' the dealer
said.
   Blue chips ``had a nice little run,'' he said, noting Sony closed
up 100 yen at 8,900 yen.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission, in what
may indicate a new get-tough policy, is contemplating action against
three radio stations it says may have aired indecent broadcasts
during the day.
   The stations in Indianapolis, Chicago and San Jose, Calif., were
given 30 days to explain their actions or face sanctions ranging
from a warning to non-renewal of their licenses, FCC General Counsel
Diane Killory said Thursday.
   The action comes just two weeks after former Missouri broadcaster
Alfred Sikes was confirmed as FCC chairman.
   Sikes and two other new commissioners were questioned closely
during Senate confirmation hearings last month on what they planned
to do about indecent programming. Obscene programming is banned.
   The agency alleges that WLUP-AM in Chicago, KSJO-FM in San Jose,
Calif., and WFBQ-FM in Indianapolis may have violated laws
prohibiting indecent or obscene programming when children may be in
the audience.
   Lawyer John R. Price, president of Decency in Broadcasting Inc.,
said the Indianapolis-based watchdog group had taped WFBQ's ``Bob
and Tom Show'' continuously since July 1987 and submitted more than
5,000 transcripts to the FCC for review.
   ``In the last six months particularly, there's been a real
decline in the quality of material,'' he said Thursday. ``It was bad
before, but it's really bad now.''
   Price said he hoped the FCC action would be ``the first step in a
process that will improve broadcasting in our area.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., an outspoken advocate of banning
indecent programming 24 hours a day, applauded the FCC action.
   ``The American people are fed up with this trash that corrupts
the minds of our children and erodes the values of our society,''
Helms said.
   However, Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the
Washington-based free-speech advocacy group Media Access Project,
criticized the FCC.
   ``I'm disappointed that Chairman Sikes' top priority seems to be
suppressing speech rather than promoting it,'' Schwartzman said.
   The FCC said that based on ``review of complaints and extensive
supporting materials received from the public,'' it was considering
actions against:
   _Evergreen Media Corp. of Chicago AM, licensee of WLUP-AM,
regarding portions of the ``Steve and Gary Show,'' which airs at
2:30 p.m.
   _Narragansett Broadcasting Co. of California, licensee of
KSJO-FM, San Jose, regarding portions of the ``Perry Stone Show,''
which aired at 6 a.m.
   _Great American TV and Radio Co., licensee of WFBQ-FM,
Indianapolis, regarding portions of the ``Bob and Tom Show,'' which
airs at 6 a.m.
   On WLUP's ``Steve and Gary Show'' on March 30, 1989, and Aug. 19,
1987, there were alleged discussions of erections; descriptions of
magazine pictures of former Miss America Vanessa Williams and
another woman; and a song about a man filming ``Kiddie Porn'' at a
youth camp.
   Stone programs on Oct. 25, 27, 28 and 31, and Nov. 4, 1988,
allegedly included a segment in which Stone told a female caller he
wanted to lick food off her body; a later segment that featured a
ribald version of the theme from the ``Beverly Hillbillies'' TV
show; a segment on incest and one on classical music performed in
``fellatio.''
   On WFBQ, there allegedly was talk Oct. 16, 1987, and Sept. 14,
1987, of sex with candy bars, and a skit of Elvis discussing sex and
Richard Nixon.
   The latest these broadcasts occurred was at 5:10 p.m., Killory
said.
   Chris Wheat, general manager of WFBQ-FM, told the Indianapolis
Star that the station was ``fairly confident'' the FCC will find
that its rules were followed.
   ``The material doesn't have the innuendo attached to it that one
might read into the complaint,'' Wheat said about the ``Bob and Tom
Show'' complaints. ``Once the material is put into context, I'm sure
we will be cleared of doing anything wrong.''
   There was no answer to telephone calls to the Chicago and San
Jose stations Thursday evening.
   The FCC, based on Supreme Court rulings in the ``seven dirty
words'' case involving comedian George Carlin, defines indecency as
``language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in
terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities
or organs. Such material may not be broadcast when there is a
reasonable risk that unsupervised children may be in the audience.''
   The commission has tried to establish a ``safe harbor'' for
indecent programming from midnight to 6 a.m., when children were
considered unlikely to be listening, but a court struck down that
rule last summer. The court said the commission could ban indecent
speech only during daytime hours.
   The FCC in June 1988 fined a Kansas City, Mo., station, KZKC-TV,
$2,000 for broadcasting the movie ``Private Lessons'' at 8 p.m. The
movie features explicit nudity in a story about a housekeeper
seducing a 15-year-old boy.
   Congress last year passed a law extending the ban on indecent
broadcast material to 24 hours, but the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington stayed implementation of the law in January pending an
appeal by broadcasters and First Amendment advocates.
   The FCC on Thursday also asked the court not to rule on the
24-hour ban challenge before the commission can study the issue
further, Killory said.

<HEAD>Eclectic Collection to Help Pay Debts of Insolvent Thrifts</HEAD>

   A castle door, a silver saddle, seven crystal
chandeliers, a bronze Indian statue and other collectibles could
help bail out a few failed Texas thrifts.
   The items, including 17th Century antiques, a Bacarach crystal
eagle, sculptures and artwork, belonged to 16 insolvent savings and
loans and will be auctioned by federal regulators Saturday to help
pay the thrifts' bills.
   Among those is Vernon Savings and Loan Association of Dallas,
whose former president is on trial for allegedly using thrift funds
to buy influence.
   In all, about 20,000 pieces are expected to bring in about
$625,000 for regulators to use in bailing out the industry.
   A similar auction in Houston last month netted the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. $795,000. Two more sales are
scheduled, ``and then we'll be out of the furniture business,'' said
John Pace, who oversees receiverships in the central regulatory
division.
   While the bulk of the items are office furnishings and banking
equipment, attention has been focused on antiques and unusual
pieces, many acquired by Vernon officials on European shopping
sprees.
   Vernon, closed by regulators in a $1.3 billion bailout in
September 1987, is frequently cited as an example of the worst
abuses in the industry, and some of its top executives have pleaded
guilty to or face fraud charges.
   Pat King, former president of Vernon, is on trial in U.S.
District Court on charges he approved using deposits to pay for
junkets for state regulators and thrift officials.
   The trial, which began Aug. 7, recessed this week because of the
death of the father of one of the prosecutors. It is scheduled to
resume Monday.
   Vernon owner Don Dixon is the target of federal criminal
investigators and already has been named in a $540 million federal
civil fraud lawsuit.
   Some of the antiques for sale during the four-day auction were in
Dixon's and other Vernon offices, Pace said.
   Among the items for sale are:
   _Seven 17th Century carved oak chairs.
   _A hand-carved castle door with brass bosses and strap work.
   _A 47-inch-tall, bronze Indian sitting on a 40-inch-by-40-inch
base.
   _Numerous smaller sculptures and statues, including several by
Frederic Remington.
   _A replica of a bald eagle, made from the feathers of
non-endangered birds.
   _Two rams horns and brass wall sconces.
   _A longhorn skull.
   _A hand-tooled, custom-made saddle with silver mounted candle,
horn, skirt and stirrups and a silver bridle.

   Stock prices churned ahead today, extending the
yearlong rally that carried the market to record highs on Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.88 to 2,740.52 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 600 up, 333 down and
525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 34.83 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market appeared to pause briefly at the opening as some
traders cashed in the dramatic gains of stock prices lately.
   But prices soon began edging ahead again on the strength of the
enthusiasm generated Thursday's record high and the widespread
public attention it received.
   Analysts say the market has been able to recoup the last of the
losses it suffered in the crash of 1987 with help from increasing
confidence that the Federal Reserve can restrain inflation without
causing a recession.
   They also note that corporate earnings have risen sharply in the
past two years, making the perceived risk in stocks less than it was
when the market peaked out two years ago today.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2} at
133}; General Electric, up { at 58|; International Business
Machines, up \ at 116\, and Philip Morris, up ~ at 159~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.20 to 195.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .71 at 382.16.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 56.53 points
to 2,734.64, surpassing its closing reading of 2,722.42 on Aug. 25,
1987.
   The gain was the second biggest this year for the average, topped
only by a 56.82-point advance on May 12.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,187 up, 353 down and 429 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 225.52 million shares, up from 159.64
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Fortune Hunters Clear Out as Sponge Prices Drop</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TARPON SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kelly Garrett promised he was
through. He was going to sell his last load of ocean sponge and
leave this Gulf Coast fishing town, where he was lured 18 months ago
by record-high sponge prices.
   Maybe he'd take his wife and child to the Bahamas and try to make
some money salvaging old wrecks.
   ``This is it,'' he said, standing amid 700 sponges drying on the
deck of a weathered fishing boat. ``I'm getting out while I at least
have my diving equipment. But I can say it was real good there for a
while.''
   Garrett became the latest defection from the Tarpon Springs
sponge fleet as prices have fallen about 80 percent since February,
when a large sponge could bring in $16 and even inexperienced divers
could easily make $1,000 a week.
   Now, it's mostly just the few veteran spongers left to wonder
about the brief boom that clogged the docks with boats and left at
least four young divers dead from accidental drownings.
   Some of the old-time sponge merchants _ mostly Greek immigrants
and their descendants _ claim the prices were inflated by Japanese
investors who recently entered the shaky Mediterranean sponge market.
   Others, like sponge buyer Julio Arellano in Miami, say a
3-year-old blight affecting Mediterranean sponge beds was
responsible for a worldwide shortage.
   ``It was simple supply and demand,'' said the executive of
Arellano Brothers Inc., the main buyer of Tarpon Springs sponges as
prices soared. ``There are no good sponges coming out of the
Mediterranean and the value of the Tarpon Springs sponges went up.
It's not more complicated than that.''
   Arellano said prices have dropped to $3 or $4 each due to the
flood of sponges on the world market from Tarpon Springs, about 30
miles north of Tampa.
   Although sponges grow in many warm-water areas, the best species
come either from the eastern Mediterranean or the Gulf waters off
Tarpon Springs, where the nutrients and rock beds are ideal for
large and hardy sponges, said John Stevely, a sponge expert
affiliated with the University of Florida.
   The Mediterranean blight, suspected to be caused by a bacteria,
makes the sponges small and brittle. A similar disease in the Gulf
of Mexico and the Caribbean in the 1940s nearly wiped out the sponge
industry in Florida and Cuba, which is now a sponge supplier to East
Bloc nations.
   A sponge is acually the remains of a marine animal that lives in
the pores. Sun drying kills the living part of the natural sponge,
now mostly sold in the United Staates as a novelty bath item or as a
non-scratching alternative to synethetic sponges. But the demand for
natural sponge is still high in Europe and elsewhere.
   George Billiris, who began sponge diving in 1939, believes
Japanese sponge interests purchased the high-priced sponges earlier
this year in an attempt to corner the market and drive out smaller
competitors.
   ``Look, if a sponge cost $15 each it would cost the consumer $45
for a sponge. That didn't happen. I think they were just trying to
protect their investments in the Mediterranean,'' said Billiris.
   But James Cantonis, president of Acme Sponge and Chamois Co. in
Tarpon Springs, said it was mostly a panic among European buyers as
inventories of pre-blight Mediterranean sponges fell.
   He also noted that European sponge buyers, who usually make
purchases by the kilogram, were unfamiliar with the denser Tarpons
Springs wool sponges.
   ``Acually, the per-kilo price was not that crazy,'' said
Cantonis, also president of the New York-based Sponge and Chamois
Institute. ``But they were surprised by the wool sponges. You got
only about half as many per kilo.
   ``At one point, our sponges were selling at $3.50 an ounce.
Silver now sells about $5 an ounce. This is not gold or silver we
are taking about.''
   Cantonis said there are no records of natural sponge sales in the
United States or worldwide.
   Although experts are not sure how long the Mediterranean blight
may last, Acme has built a new sponge processing plant to meet
European demand.
   ``This portends well for Tarpon Springs,'' he said. ``What the
prices will do, I cannot say.''
   When the boom began, sponge diver Cary Barger said he predicted
prices would fall. He also was correct about his other preminition _
that untrained divers would die.
   In February, more than 200 people were diving for sponges. Now,
there's less than two dozen. The U.S. Coast Guard investigated the
deaths of at least four divers.
   Some of the victims were working alone and had problems with the
air compressors or tangled air hoses. Divers can spend up to nine
hours under 30 to 40 feet of water.
   ``This is serious business and people just thought you jump down
there and pick up sponges like you pick up money,'' said Barger, who
started diving two years ago. ``It was insane.''
   ``Everyone is looking for the next oil boom,'' said Cantonis.
``Everyone is looking to become a millionaire overnight. Well, I can
tell you, this is not the business they should be looking at.''

<TEXT>
   When engineering graduate David Kimbrell
looked around in the mid-1980s and wondered how to make a living, he
found the answer buried in the walls.
   Along with colleague Frank Hall, Kimbrell founded one of the
first consulting firms that advise the best way to test for and
dispose of asbestos, the widely used building insulation that has
been found to cause cancer.
   Then Kimbrell had a hunch about schools.
   By the time Congress approved a 1986 law requiring control and
cleanup of asbestos in school buildings, Kimbrell already had a
national marketing campaign ready.
   Hall-Kimbrell's growth exploded, its revenues tripling over the
past three years from contracts with 15 percent of the nation's
school districts.
   ``I don't know if it's a sixth sense or what, but we kind of feel
things coming,'' said Kimbrell, 38. ``We try to watch for the
regulatory trends _ what's the research on what is toxic, what are
the liability issues _ and we felt that asbestos was going to be a
major problem.''
   Now Kimbrell is betting on his sixth sense again.
   ``We started watching Japan two or three years ago,'' he said.
``And we speculated that they were just at that stage of
industrialization where they're starting to address the issues of
asbestos and employee occupational exposure. So far, we've been
right.''
   Kimbrell bought out Hall's interest in the firm after the first
few months of business, although he's retained the Hall-Kimbrell
corporate name.
   His hunches have propelled Hall-Kimbrell's growth since he and
his wife drew up a five-year plan in 1983 for the company they'd
started in Mississippi the year before. They'd already made $120,000
from asbestos consulting and were trying to decide what to do.
   ``We wanted to be the best environmental engineering firm in the
nation,'' he said. ``We decided to take the specialty we knew,
asbestos, and form a national company on that. So we drew up a plan
to take literally every penny we made and put it back into growth.''
   The plague of lingering asbestos resurfaced this past week, when
federal prosecutors filed civil suits against several defendants
nationwide alleging improper handling of the material during
renovation and removal projects. The lawsuits underscored the
importance of the kind of services that Hall-Kimbrell and other
asbestos-cleansing consultants provide.
   Hall-Kimbrell has surveyed more than 1,300 school districts for
asbestos, in addition to 15 state governments, 200 colleges, ten
airports and thousands of commercial clients. Typically, its
engineers develop a plan to remove or contain asbestos, then monitor
another company that actually does the work.
   Its revenues grew from $248,000 in 1983 to $45 million last year
and a 34th place on Inc. magazine's list of the fastest-growing U.S.
companies.
   The firm now employs about 800 people in 26 offices.
Hall-Kimbrell moved to Lawrence, near Kansas City, to be in the
central part of the country and near a regional Environmental
Protection Agency office, but much of its work remains on the East
Coast.
   According to plan, Hall-Kimbrell also began diversifying in the
late 1980s, advising companies on environmental problems ranging
from hazardous wastes and groundwater contamination.
   Next year, it expects to start a hotline in connection with
grocery store chains, to let customers know how much pesticide is in
the produce they buy.
   The fast growth hasn't been problem free. The company laid off 39
workers earlier this summer in a move to cut costs.
   Earlier this year, Kimbrell had considered a $72.5 million buyout
offer from Law Companies Group, an Atlanta environmental firm. But
Kimbrell said he rejected the deal because of differences with Law
Companies over control.
   Nonetheless, many analysts think such deals are the industry's
future.
   Fast-growing, small to medium-sized companies such as
Hall-Kimbrell have dominated the asbestos-control business up to
now, but bigger environmental services companies are want a piece of
the market now estimated between $1 billion and $3 billion a year,
said Steven Bernard, a securities analyst with Edward D. Jones &amp; Co.
in St. Louis.
   Analysts foresee most of the industry's growth in the United
States, as more states approve even stricter asbestos guidelines for
private buildings.
   But that hasn't stopped Hall-Kimbrell from pressing ahead with
its overseas plans. Most of its business overseas currently involves
advising Japanese firms that own U.S. property, said John Carlin, a
former Kansas governor who sits on Hall-Kimbrell's board of
directors and has helped it get started in Japan.
   ``Given the context of how long it takes to set up business
there, they're doing extremely well,'' Carlin said.

   Texas Air Corp. says it is considering selling a
minority or controlling stake in its Continental Airlines subsidiary
and has talked to parties interested in the airline.
   Texas Air, the nation's largest airline company, also said
Thursday it has hired an investment adviser to explore a possible
transaction.
   The announcement came a week after a Boston investment firm
disclosed that it holds 12 percent of Texas Air, which also owns
strike-plagued Eastern Airlines. Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co., a Boston
portfolio management company, has said its 12 percent stake was held
for investment because it believed Texas Air would show a profit in
1990.
   Scandinavian Airlines System owns around 10 percent of Texas Air.
   Late Thursday, Texas Air released a statement saying its
chairman, Frank Lorenzo, revealed that the company was considering a
possible sale of an interest in Continental during a management
conference.
   Lorenzo said in a statement there were arguments in favor of
selling Continental, such as giving the airline access to stronger
financial resources.
   However, he said, ``there are also a number of compelling reasons
why a sale of the company may not be advisable.''
   Continental is emerging from a period of consolidations with
other airlines as a stronger company and shows potential for
improved financial results, Lorenzo said.
   Texas Air said it retained the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. as an adviser on any transaction. Continental spokesman
Ned Walker declined to comment further on the statement.
   Miami-based Eastern is in the midst of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. The carrier filed for protection from its creditors
on March 9, five days after its machinists, pilots and flight
attendants went on strike. Since then, it has been rebuilding as a
smaller airline using non-union workers.
   In 1983, Lorenzo followed a similar path with Continental.
   Airline industry analysts expressed surprise at Lorenzo's
announcement.
   ``I expected Continental would be the last thing he would dispose
of,'' said Louis Marckesano of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia.
   Continental would carry a sale price of about $2 billion if it
were sold in its entirety, and Lorenzo may just be trying to find
out what Continental is worth, he suggested.
   ``He might just be testing the waters,'' Marckesano said.
   Many observers had expected Lorenzo to fold the remnants of
Eastern into Continental, he noted.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he would be
considering a major sale,'' said Daniel Hersh, an analyst with
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.
   He speculated that Lorenzo might be considering bringing in a
high-profile purchaser to change Continental's image as a low-fare
carrier that does not appeal to business travelers.
   ``I think the biggest problem is the image of Continental with
the business travelers,'' Hersh said.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower in light
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Prices were being pressured today by forecasts of rain in much of
the Plains and the Ohio Valley.
   But there was concern the severe weather forecast for parts of
the Plains could have an adverse impact on some crop areas, said
Joel Karlin, an analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Another drag on prices was the lack of action in the cash
markets. Analysts said few farmers are bringing their product to
market.
   With the exception of wheat, there was little export demand for
grain and beans, Karlin said.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1 cent lower in all
contracts with the contract for delivery in September at $3.93} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower with September at $2.33\ a bushel;
oats were { cent lower to { cent higher with September at $1.37{ a
bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with
September at $5.94{ cents a bushel.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent lower to .03 cent higher with October
at 75.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .38 cent
lower with August at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to
.35 cent lower with October at 41.32 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at
41.52 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled lower and pork futures were mixed in
Thursday's trading.

   Pilots from major competitors are volunteering to
stage a wildcat work stoppage Sept. 4 to support Eastern Airlines
strikers, a union official said Thursday.
   ``It's called Shut Down America,'' said Hank Weber, a spokesman
for the Eastern local of the Air Line Pilots Association. ``It's one
of those things. We've never had anything from the grassroots like
this before. All we can do is watch and see what happens.''
   Weber said the union wasn't organizing the effort and had no
details, but has been flooded with messages of support. He showed
messages from pilots for such airlines as United, Northwest, TWA and
Aloha Airlines.
   One message called for ``S.O.S. _ Suspension of Service; Sick-Out
in September ... Are you sick of what's happening to our Eastern
brothers?''
   ALPA's executive council, representing pilots at most of the
nation's major airlines, last week took no action on a request by
Eastern's pilots for a national work stoppage to show solidarity
with the strike that will be six months old on Sept. 4.
   However, Weber said that while unions can be fined or face other
sanctions for encouraging wildcat strikes, an unofficial sickout may
be forming as an alternative. Sept. 4 is Labor Day, a heavy travel
day.
   Weber said members of other unions, including some outside the
airline industry, also have offered to participate.
   Eastern's union leadership met in Washington on Thursday to plan
strategy. While some leaders two weeks ago discussed ending the
strike, their rank-and-file members have voted in local meetings to
continue.
   The pilots, who joined Eastern's Machinists and flight attendants
in a March 4 walkout, said they want action to dramatize that their
strike is continuing and that Eastern is rebuilding with
inexperienced, newly hired pilots who are jeopardizing safety.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the company wouldn't comment
on the reported work stoppage effort.
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, whose reputed
union-busting has been the focus of the strike, announced late
Thursday that he is considering selling a minority or controlling
stake in Eastern's sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   In Atlanta, meanwhile, the local chief of the Eastern pilots
union said Thursday he will resign in a disagreement over continuing
the strike.
   James B. Holder, the head of the Atlanta local of Eastern's
pilots union, said the 300 pilots who attended a Wednesday meeting
voted to continue the strike.
   He said he objected to the decision because by continuing to
strike, Eastern ``could hire enough replacement pilots and we could

<TEXT>
   The commodities trading firm Capcom Financial
Services Ltd. has been expelled from the Chicago Board of Trade in
the wake of charges the firm engaged in a multimillion-dollar
drug-money laundering scheme.
   London-based Capcom agreed to the expulsion and to never reapply
for membership in the CBOT, according to an exchange statement
Thursday.
   The firm was suspended July 17 for violating exchange rules
requiring member firms to maintain and produce accurate records of
customer accounts.
   Capcom had been a member of the CBOT since 1985, officials said.
   Capcom and one of its officers, S.Z.A. Akbar, were indicted in
October following a two-year government sting operation in Tampa,
Fla. in which federal agents infiltrated a money-laundering
syndicate with ties to a Columbian drug cartel.
   Seventy-nime people and entities, including the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International of Luxembourg, were indicted.

   Stock prices were mixed today, struggling to
extend the yearlong rally that carried the market to record highs on
Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 56.53 points Thursday
to surpass the peak it reached two years ago, rose another 5.31 to
2,739.95 by noontime on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 646 up, 672 down and 551
unchanged.
   The market appeared to pause as some traders cashed in the
dramatic gains of stock prices lately.
   But prices generally held steady on the strength of the
enthusiasm generated by Thursday's record high and the widespread
public attention it received.
   Analysts say the market has been able to recoup the last of the
losses it suffered in the crash of 1987 with help from increasing

<TEXT>
   When the first 4-minute mile was run it generated
enthusiastic forecasts of a 3-minute, 50-second mile to come. When a
high-jumper achieved 8 feet, sports enthusiasts said man could go
higher.
   Same thing in stocks: Records create excitement and enthusiasm
for more. When the Dow Jones industrial average reached a new high
last week you could hear the roar of the boosters seeking even
greater heights.
   It might work. It might not.
   Excitement and enthusiasm have been ingredients of stock markets
for all time, and to some unmeasured degree they have an impact. But
when the cheering stops, it's the pace of the economy and profits
that dictate prices.
   The consensus forecast is for the economy to grow slowly, just
skirting recession. The corporate profits outlook is for a loss of
momentum, a decline in the rate of growth. It is happening already.
   Conceivably, the stock market could ``see'' something the
economists don't. It wouldn't be the first time it has foreseen
better or worse times than the consensus forecast. It could happen
again.
   Whatever, the scaffolding for stock prices is stronger now than
it was before the October 1987 crash, when enthusiasm alone seemed
to carry the market for several hundred points.
   Whether or not it is sufficiently strong is debatable.
   Wright Investors' Service, which relies on numerical rather than
oratorical evidence of support, advises a look at the profits
picture, specifically the slowing of the rate at which profits are
rising.
   With reports in from 90 percent of the companies making up the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, second-quarter earnings are
estimated to have risen only 5 percent from the same period a year
ago. That's hardly bullish.
   That second-quarter performance appears even weaker when compared
with the first quarter's year-over-year increase of 22 percent, and
with a 36 percent increase for the entire year 1988 vs. 1987.
   As measured by perhaps the most popular index of all, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, the indications of support
are no stronger. Compared with a year earlier, second-quarter
earnings of the 30 companies were down 5 percent.
   Many things move stock markets, and percentages such as these are
only one of them. But there's one thing you can say about declines
in profits or declines in the rate at which they are rising: They
cannot be ignored.
   Eventually, stock prices and earnings must reconcile their
differences. They cannot go separate ways for long, any more than
the human heart and lungs can operate at their own individual tempos.
   Perhaps a better indication of the future might evolve from a
government report due to be released this week, the Commerce
Department's estimate of ``real'' corporate profits.
   Wright believes the 7-year bull market has had a sound basis for
much of its life, since operating profits _ excluding profits from
price-inflated inventories and adjusted for depreciation _ did rise
sustantially.
   But, it adds, over the past three years operating profits haven't
been as impressive as they were earlier in the expansion. In fact,
it says, they've been unimpressive, and becoming more so.
   It expects this week's Commerce Department report to show signs
of further profit deterioration.

<HEAD>British Car-Hire Firm Receives Friendly Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avis Europe PLC, a British vehicle rental and
leasing company, announced Friday it has received a friendly offer
that could lead to its eventual reunification with Avis Inc., the
international company.
   It said the bidder, Cilva Holdings PLC, valued Avis Europe at
896.5 million pounds, the equivalent of $1.4 billion, or 600 pence a
share.
   Avis Europe shares soared 32 pence to 592 pence on the London
Stock Exchange by midmorning.
   Cilva is 64.7-percent-owned by Lease International SA, a
Luxembourg-based holding company which already owns 33.6 percent of
Avis's existing shares. Avis Inc. owns 8.8 percent of Cilva and
General Motors Capital Corp. has the rest.
   Cilva is said to have has assurances of an additional 26.4
percent of Avis Europe's share capital, leaving 40 percent of Avis
Europe's shares outstanding. Avis Europe's board, except for three
individuals, has recommended that its shareholders take up the Cilva
offer.
   Three years ago Avis Inc. owned Avis Europe, but was taken over
in a leveraged buyout by Westray Capital Corp, a U.S. consortium,
which then floated 66 percent of Avis Europe on the London Stock
Exchange. Relations between the two Avis groups remained friendly.
   Wesray sold Avis Inc. to the rental company's employees in 1987.
   Lease International, consisting of two Belgian investors, was
formed solely to hold Avis Europe's shares, and said upon completing
the offer an appropriate environment would exist for reuniting Avis
Europe and Avis Inc.
   This, it said, would enhance the growth prospects of both
companies.
   Avis Europe, Avis Inc. and Lease International said they see
``strong commercial reasons'' for uniting the two Avis units, which
will be easier and more highly leveraged under a private company
structure.
   The announcement was seen as underlining Avis Inc.'s desire for a
foothold in Europe before 1992, when the 12 nations of The European
Economic Community are to drop their trade barriers.
   In the financial year ended February, Avis Europe reported a 31
percent rise in pretax profits to 72 million pounds.

<HEAD>UN Says Economic Sanctions Harm South Africa, But Are Not Foolproof</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world is tightening its economic
boycott of South Africa, but the apartheid state exploits loopholes
such as foreign registration, mislabeling and third-party shipping
to carry on trade, says a new report.
   Among the most vociferous proponents of sanctions are the black
front-line states of southern Africa, which ironically carry on
considerable trade with South Africa and are tied to it by railroads
and power lines. These nations do not ban bilateral trade with South
Africa.
   The report issued this week from the United Nations Center on
Transnational Corporations notes that in recent years the front-line
states have become transshipment points for South African goods.
   Among other South African tactics cited in the report are these:
   _Mislabeling export goods such as textiles sent to America,
apples to Europe and wines to Canada.
   _Illegal transfer of ownership on oil shipments to skirt the ban
on such shipments from oil-producing states.
   _Transshipment of goods through other states. South Africa's
textile industry, for example, makes extensive use of foreign
factories to complete the manufacture of fabrics and assemble
garments.
   _Sending South African coal to European ports that do not ban it,
primarily Rotterdam and Anterp, where it is mixed with other
nations' coal to produce ``Dutch blend'' or simply relabeled as
Dutch and transshipped.
   _Turning to the booming Far Eastern nations for increased trade
as North American and European nations have tightened their
sanctions.
   Still, most governments have responded to appeals by the General
Assembly for a voluntary sanctions on South Africa, the report notes.
   ``As a result, broad geographical and economic areas and sectors
have been left outside the reach of South Africa, or avoidance
practices in these areas have imposed additional costs on its
economy,'' the report says.
   The Center notes that ``markets for South African products have
declined in size, indicating that efforts to evade sanctions have
been only partially successful.''
   The report did not set an exact figure on the cost of sanctions
to South Africa, but noted the country's economy has been weak
through the 1980s with a growth rate below 1.5 percent a year.
   Official unemployment rates among South African blacks is at
least 15 percent and unofficial estimates are much higher. In
addition, the country has a foreign debt of $22 billion,
three-fourths of it owed to transnational banks.
   The General Assembly has been urging nations and companies to
shun South Africa since 1962.
   The Security Council imposed a mandatory ban on arms trade with
South Africa in 1977. That spurred the country to develop its own
arms industry, which has turned into a profitable export business.
   In 1985, the Security Council endorsed a voluntary embargo on new
investments, export loan guarantees, the sale of Krugerrand gold
coins, nuclear contracts and computer equipment.
   However, Britain and the United States have always vetoed
resolutions that call for mandatory sanctions, saying that would
hurt the black population.
   The U.N. plans hearings in Geneva Sept. 4-6 on corporate links to
South Africaand its colony Namibia.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures closed lower Friday in
quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The selloff was attributed to the forecasts for rain in the
plains states and the Ohio Valley over the weekend and expectation
of more precipitation next week, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   As a result of the rain, traders are expecting improved corn and
soybean crop conditions next week, Gustafson said.
   Slack export sales and a drop in processor demand were also cited
as a cause of the selloff in soybeans and corn.
   ``There is not much working in terms of export sales, which is a
problem for the market,'' Gustafson said.
   The selloff in the corn and soybean pits spilled over into wheat
futures, where the lack of new export sales also hurt prices.
   At the close, wheat was 3} cents to 6\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.90{ a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 1} cents lower with September at $2.33 a bushel; oats were

   Stock prices retreated slightly in late trading
today, the second anniversary of the peak that preceded the crash of
1987.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks was down 3.61
points at 2,731.03 at 3 p.m. EDT.
   On Thursday _ one day short of the market peak's second
anniversary _ the market's most famous barometer soared 56.53 points
to surpass by 12 points its previous all-time high of Aug. 25, 1987.
   The 1987 peak was the start of a short but severe bear market
that culminated in the worst day in Wall Street history, the
508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials on Oct. 19, 1987.
   Market analysts said the risk of a financial meltdown was far
lower today than two years ago, and evidence of the 1987 debacle was
hard to find this week.
   ``The quote of the day is something like: What crash?'' Robert
Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.,
the New York arm of a Japanese brokerage firm, said Thursday.
   Supporting the stock market in 1989 are a healthy dollar,
relatively low interest rates and optimism that the economy will
manage to steer a middle course between recession and high inflation.
   Most of all, there is no speculative bubble ready to be popped.
Stock prices are far lower in relation to underlying company profits
than they were two years ago, said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist
at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   ``Fundamentally this is a great expression of confidence in the
whole U.S. economic outlook,'' Kudlow said. ``We keep throwing
negatives at the market and they don't stick.''
   Added David M. Jones, chief economist at the brokerage firm
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., ``Essentially the stock market is telling
us that a soft landing is in store for the economy, and that's
exactly the slowdown you need to keep inflation from accelerating,''
   While some other strategists are more skeptical about the
economy's health, a market rally can sometimes feed on itself
regardless of fundamental factors.
   ``The worst thing that can happen to an institutional money
manager is to sit there with a pile of cash and watch the market
take off without him. It's a buying panic,'' said Lawrence R.
Helfand, managing director for retail sales at the Chicago brokerage
Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   Thursday's gain was the second-biggest of the year, and it came
in the heaviest trading since mid-June, a good sign for the market.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 225.52 million shares.
   A subdued cheer rose from the exchange floor after the close
Thursday.
   ``A day like every other day _ no big deal,'' said Peter Mancuso,
a specialist with Albert Fried &amp; Co. ``There was no question in
everybody's mind that the market would get back to these levels. It
just needed some time.''
   There was no economic news Thursday to account for the big jump.
Bonds were up slightly and the dollar edged higher.
   ``The market's going up just on its own. When you call around,
there's no reason. It just went up,'' Brusca said.
   From its low point at the close of Black Monday to its close
Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 57 percent.
   ``While nobody's paid much attention to it, it's two of the
strongest years, back to back, that we've had,'' Helfand said.

<HEAD>Hearing Scheduled on Motion to Rescind Liquidation Decision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A hearing has been scheduled next month
to determine whether former Ohio financier Marvin Warner will be
allowed to reorganize his financial affairs to stave off liquidation.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor scheduled a hearing Sept. 7
on whether Warner's case should be converted back to a Chapter 11
reorganization, instead of the Chapter 7 liquidation decreed by the
court July 28.
   ``We hope at this hearing to present the true perspective of this
case and unmask the nature of the claimants,'' Warner said following
a hearing Friday.
   In his motion before the court, the former U.S. ambassador to
Switzerland, who is appealing a securities conviction in Ohio,
claimed he was not given proper advance notification of plans to
convert the case to Chapter 7, which allows the appointment of a
trustee and liquidation of a debtor's assets.
   Warner, target of a flood of lawsuits following the collapse of
his Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank in March 1985, said he
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in
October 1987 in an attempt to consolidate the legal actions.
   ``I came to Chapter 11 not because I owed people money. I wanted
to consolidate in one forum these many lawsuits,'' Warner said
Friday.
   He contends a list of creditors, including the state of Ohio,
seeking $4.5 billion are merely claimants.
   ``I don't owe anybody anything,'' Warner said. ``The attorney
general of Ohio has stated that the losses in the closing of Home
State have substantially been recovered. ... How can the state of
Ohio justify having a claim of $275 million?''
   In March 1987, the creditors obtained a federal court order that
Warner pay back to Ohio $22 million needed to guarantee Home State
deposits.
   Warner, 70, was convicted on Ohio felony charges in Home State's
collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial.
He is appealing the state conviction and a $22 million restitution
order.
   Home State collapsed four days after ESM Government Securities in
Fort Lauderdale was shut down by federal regulators for insolvency.
Home State had invested heavily with ESM through securities trade
and lost $144 million when ESM was closed.
   Several months after the Home State collapse, Warner and his wife
Jody moved from suburban Cincinnati to a 153-acre farm near Ocala,
where Warner breeds throughbred horses.
   Warner contends that more than 80 percent of his 1986 income was
derived from farming, and farmer's estates can't be converted to
Chapter 7 without the debtor's consent.
   Warner also claims $18 million of his estate is exempt from
bankruptcy under Florida's homestead law, which allows people to
protect their homes from bankruptcy proceedings. The law protects up
to one-half acre in urban areas and 160 acres in rural areas.
   Meanwhile, Warner's creditors and attorneys have been meeting in
an attempt to settle his bankruptcy case, but so far have not
reached any agreement.
   At a hearing Thursday, West Palm Beach attorney Daniel Bakst was
replaced as trustee of Warner's estate by Tallahassee attorney
Ronald Mowrey.

   Stock prices pulled back a bit today, hesitating

   The market appeared to pause as some traders cashed in the

   Two soybean traders and a clerk pleaded guilty
Friday to charges of improper trading practices, while 12 others
pleaded innocent in the government's probe of alleged fraud at the
world's largest futures exchanges.
   All those who appeared before U.S. District Judge William Hart
were involved in soybean-trading activity at the Chicago Board of
Trade during a 2{-year undercover probe by FBI agents masquerading
as traders.
   The four remaining soybean traders charged are to be arraigned
Sept. 7.
   A total of 45 traders and the clerk were indicted earlier this
month after the investigation at the Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   The three who pleaded guilty Friday were freed on bond and have
agreed to cooperate with the government in the remaining cases. They
most likely will testify against co-defendants at upcoming trials,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Sheila Finnegan.
   David Skrodski, 32, a soybean broker, admitted that he defrauded
customers by making prearranged trades in 1987 that he profited from
with others charged in the alleged scheme. He could be sentenced to
a maximum of six years in prison and fined up to $350,000.
   Craig LaCrosse, a 40-year-old father of four, admitted that he
accepted an illegal prearranged trade from an undercover FBI agent
posing as a trader in August 1988. He also admitted that he ``aided
and abetted'' defendant James Nowak, accused of doctoring a trade to
make it look as though LaCrosse had been involved in the deal, as a
way to pay back money Nowak owed LaCrosse.
   Nowak was among the 12 soybean traders who pleaded innocent.
   LaCrosse also could face a maximum six-year prison term and
$350,000 fine.
   Michael Weiser, a 21-year-old soybean clerk, said he helped
execute prearranged trades between Nowak and the undercover agent in
August 1988, between Nowak and Skrodksi, and between Nowak and
defendant John Vercillo, who pleaded innocent.
   Weiser also pleaded guilty to failing to file an income-tax
return reporting his 1987 income _ approximately $7,700. He could be
sentenced to a maximum four-year prison term and fined $400,000 on
all charges.
   But prosecutors ``agreed that if he continues to provide
substantial assistance'' in the probe, they likely will seek a
lighter sentence, Ms. Finnegan said after the hearing.
   No sentencing date was set for the three.
   Besides Nowak, 47, and Vercillo, 44, soybean traders entering
innocent pleas Friday were: Scott Anixter, 40; Bradley Ashman, 28;
William Barcal III, 35; Charles Bergstrom, 42; Edward Cox III, 28;
Martin Dempsey, 52; Joel Fetchenhier, 49; Thomas Kenney, 35; Bruce
Mittelstadt, 49; and Sheldon Schneider, 46.
   Hart set a Feb. 5 trial date for the 12 traders.

   Crude oil prices slipped Friday as traders
assumed a cautious stance ahead of an OPEC committee meeting next
month.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of crude oil, lost 10 cents to close at $18.51 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, adding to a 19-cent slide on Thursday.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also closed lower.
   The September contract for home heating oil fell 0.27 cent to
settle at 51.43 cents a gallon, adding to a 0.21-cent decline
Thursday. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for September delivery dropped
0.85 to 53.30 cents a gallon, reversing a 0.22-cent rise the
previous session.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has scheduled a
Sept. 23 meeting of its price monitoring committee, and although the
session is a month away and the panel has no power to change prices,
traders are already cautious, said Andrew Lebow, a senior broker and
analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The committee, which will meet in Geneva, can make
recommendations on oil prices _ including possible suggestions to
raise the OPEC benchmark price of $18 a barrel _ to the full
13-nation cartel.
   Lebow said some traders have been reluctant to take speculative
positions in the market because of the uncertainty raised by the
meeting.
   Gasoline futures declined Friday as demand slackened, and there
was little interest in the heating oil market, Lebow said.

<HEAD>Dollar Finishes Higher At Home, Gold Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar finished higher Friday in domestic
dealings after declining overseas.
   Gold prices moved sharply lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery fell $3.80 to close at
$360.70 troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late
bid for gold of $360.25 an ounce, down from $362.40 late Thursday.
   Trading was quiet, but U.S. currency dealers said the dollar
moved within a wide range before closing on the highs of the day.
   Profit-taking in London, where a three-day holiday weekend was
about to begin, helped push the dollar down overseas.
   But traders in the United States interpreted the lower dollar as
a bargain and began buying the currency at midday, driving the price
up.
   ``There was a failure of the dollar to follow through on the down
side,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston's
New York office.
   Others agreed that sentiment toward the U.S. currency remains
bullish.
   ``There's no risk per se in holding dollars,'' said Michael
McDonald, a trader at Chicago-based Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank.
``Money is flowing into Wall Street, into the bond market, and
people just like the dollar.''
   Traders expect the market to liven up next week with the
government's release of revised second-quarter gross national
product figures on Tuesday and August employment figures on Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed lower at 143.53 Japanese yen, down
from 143.60 late Thursday. Later in London, the dollar traded lower
at 143.25 yen. In New York, however, the dollar closed at 143.90
yen, up from 143.21 yen on Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5725 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.5698. But in New York,
one pound cost $1.5660, cheaper than $1.5720 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.9630 West German marks, up from 1.9565; 1.6918 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6870; 6.6115 French francs, up from 6.5955;
1,405.63 Italian lire, up from 1,402.50, and 1.1746 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1748.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.9540 West German Marks, down from 1.9585; 1.6840 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6880; 6.5895 French francs, down from 6.6060;
2.2055 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2095; 1,405.05 Italian lire, down
from 1,406.75; 1.1732 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1765.
   Gold prices fell. In London gold finished at a bid $360.45, down
from $362.75 late Thursday. In Zurich gold fell to $360.25 bid, from
$362.00. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $361.55 bid, down from
$364.15.
   Silver prices also slipped. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery fell to $5.108 a troy ounce from $5.166 on
Thursday. In London the metal traded at a bid $5.13 a troy ounce,
down from $5.17.

<HEAD>Fed Decided To Lower Interest Rates Last Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policymakers voted to nudge
interest rates lower in July, but they worried about reigniting
inflation by going too far, according to minutes of the meeting
released Friday.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, noting fairly consistent
weakness in housing and consumer spending, voted 10-1 at the end of
its July 5-6 meeting to lower short-term interest rates.
   Subsequently, the benchmark federal funds rate _ the rate banks
charge each other for overnight loans _ fell twice, in quarter-point
increments, to 9 percent.
   It was the third credit-easing move by the central bank since
early June after the federal funds rate hit a peak of more than 9.75
percent. The first loosening move had ended a year-long program that
increased the rate by three percentage points in an effort to
squelch inflationary pressures.
   However, since last month, the Fed has held interest rates steady
and the minutes indicate many members believed additional easing
would be unwise ``in the absence of further indications of lagging
economic growth.''
   ``Many emphasized that current economic and financial
uncertainties called for caution in adjusting policy at this
point,'' the minutes said. ``In this view, more than a slight move
to less restraint could have an undesireable effect on inflationary
expectations.''
   ``In the view of some members, there remained some risk that
inflationary pressures would intensify and that the easing might
have to be reversed later,'' the minutes said.
   Martha Seger was the only committee member to dissent and H.
Robert Heller, who earlier had announced his intention to resign
from the Fed, was absent.
   The minutes indicate Seger believed the economy had slowed
``substantially'' and likely would weaken further next year unless
the central bank pushed rates down more sharply than the majority
decided.
   The open market committee is composed of the seven Federal
Reserve Board governors and five of the 12 presidents of regional
Federal Reserve Banks. It meets privately about eight times a year.
   It aims to provide enough growth in the money supply to keep the
economy out of a recession but also to avoid overheated growth that
could accelerate inflation.
   The committee issues directives that govern the open market desk
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Through purchases or sales
of government securities, the Fed influences the amount of money
banks have available to make loans and thus the price of those
loans, interest rates.
   The July directive to the New York bank, in Fed parlance, was
``neutral.'' The members decided that after the rate decline in
July, ``some firming or some easing ... would be acceptable ...
depending on indications of inflationary pressures (and) the
strength of the business expansion.''
   The open market committee met again on Tuesday, but minutes from
that gathering won't be made public until three days after the next
meeting on Oct. 3.
   Inflation has cooled recently, but most analysts, pointing to
signs the economy may be rebounding from sluggishness in the first
half, believe the committee decided at its latest meeting to
continue an even-handed policy.
   The unemployment rate dipped to 5.2 percent in July and retail
sales rose 0.9 percent. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of
6.7 percent from January through May, but fell to a little less than
half of that in June and July as gasoline and food prices eased.
   The July meeting also sets monetary targets for the rest of the
year and preliminary targets for the following year. The committee
voted unanimously for a growth target this year of 3 percent to 7
percent for a broad measure of the money supply that includes cash,
checking and savings accounts and money market mutual funds.
   However, the committee split 10-1 in recommending that the same
target be maintained in 1990, breaking with the recent practice of
reducing the target annually.
   Silas Keehn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,
dissented, the minutes said, because he believed ``a reduction of
the ranges for the next year would provide an important signal of
the (Fed's) continuing commitment to price stability.''

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Expected to Creep Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat production is up from last year's
drought-shriveled harvest but not enough to forestall another drain
on U.S. grain reserves and an upward creep in prices, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The analysis by the department's Economic Research Service was
based on the Aug. 10 estimate that wheat production would be about
2.04 billion bushels, up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest.
   Wheat use, including exports, is expected to be 2.29 billion
bushels in the marketing year that began on June 1, down 5 percent
from 1988-89.
   ``With U.S. farm prices expected near the target price ($4 per
bushel) in 1989-90, and increased competitor supplies, exports may
decline more than 10 percent to less than 1.3 billion bushels,'' the
report said. ``The U.S. share of world trade is expected to slip as
well.''
   At the end of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year, the United States
had about 694 million bushels from previous harvests in its
stockpile. And this June 1 ``carryover'' was down from more than
1.26 billion bushels a year earlier.
   By next June 1, the report said, the wheat stockpile will be
trimmed further to an estimated 474 million bushels, down more than
30 percent and the smallest carryover since 1974-75.
   Most of the reduction will occur in the inventories held by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp. as forfeited collateral for
price-support loans made to producers. Other reductions will be in
the ``farmer-owned reserve'' of wheat stored under loan and released
to the market as prices rise and the loans become due.
   ``Area planted increased 17 percent in response to attractive
prices and less acreage idled under annual government programs, but
yields are forecast to be the lowest since 1978'' because of
lingering drought in major wheat production areas, the report said.
   Because of the continued tight wheat supply, the government has
lowered the land-idling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent of the
base acreage, down from 10 percent for 1989 and 27.5 percent in
1988. That is land farmers must take from production in order to
qualify for federal supports.
   Wheat prices are projected to average in the range of $3.85 to
$4.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, up from $3.72
estimated for 1988-89.

   Stock prices posted a small loss Friday,
hesitating after the yearlong rally that carried the market to
record highs on Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 56.53
points Thursday, slipped back 2.28 to 2,732.36. That left the
average with a net gain of 44.39 points for the week.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
716 up, 798 down and 485 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.93 million
shares, down from 225.52 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 200.16 million shares.
   The market appeared to pause as some traders cashed in the

<HEAD>Dow Jones Industrials Dip One Day After Setting Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief look at the stock market at the
end of a record-setting week for the Dow Jones average:
   _WHAT HAPPENED: Stocks dipped slightly Friday after rocketing
Thursday to a record for the Dow Jones industrial average of
2,734.64. The close on Friday was 2,732.36, a drop of 2.28 points.
Friday marked the second anniversary of the average's last peak,
which preceded the crash of October 1987. Declining issues
outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange,
and volume receded.
   _WHY: The market's recent rally has built on itself. Bullish
analysts say the outlook for corporate profits is good and the
economy is likely to navigate successfully between inflation and
recession. A follow-through to Thursday's rally was cut short by
wary investors who chose to cash in their recent gains.
   _THE WINNERS: Airline stocks, buoyed by takeover speculation
rather than solid economic fundamentals, have helped carry the
market upward in recent months. Airline stocks lagged in Thursday's
rally but surged ahead again Friday. UAL gained another $10 a share
to $278.
   _THE LOSERS: Precious metals stocks don't usually do well in bull
markets because paper brings a better return than gold and silver.
Mining companies like ASA and Hecla Mining lost ground on Thursday
and were little changed Friday.
   _WHAT'S AHEAD: Stock analysts will be keeping an eye on the
outlook for inflation and economic growth. The coming week will
bring a slew of economic statistics, including a revision of the
second-quarter gross national product, July personal income and
factory orders, and August unemployment figures.

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said
Friday he was considering a sale of Continental Airlines because the
``noise'' at strike-torn Eastern Airlines was hurting the sister
carrier's business.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Lorenzo said the sale
of part or all of Houston-based Continental was under discussion
partly because of the negative impact from Eastern's bitter strike
and bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' Lorenzo said
in his New York office. ``We have an obligation to look for
alternatives ... (Continental) has been impacted by the noise level
from all of our friends over in Miami.''
   He made the surprise announcement about Continental late Thursday
in response to a question at a company meeting.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since March 9, five days after pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing
as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers.
   The spillover from the Eastern situation has eroded bookings on
Continental flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter,
said Lorenzo, whose Texas Air is the parent of the two carriers.
Continental showed a net profit of $32.1 million in the quarter,
compared with a loss of $150.9 million a year earlier.
   Continental could benefit from ``distance'' from Eastern, Lorenzo
said. He cited the success of the Trump Shuttle, which enjoyed a
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer Donald Trump
bought it from Eastern in early June for $365 million.
   Lorenzo stressed, however, a full or partial sale of Continental
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision
hasn't yet been made.
   ``We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible
sale, he said.
   Despite the strife at Eastern and Continental's reputation as a
fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, Texas Air stock has
soared from around $9 or $10 a share at the beginning of the year to
over $20 currently. It rose 87{ cents Friday to close at $20.75 on
the American Stock Exchange, after jumping as high as $22.25.
   Possible buyers of Continental or part of it could include
Scandinavian Airlines System, which has a 10 percent interest in
Texas Air, and Pan Am Corp., which has expressed a desire to merge
with another airline. Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are allowed
to buy up to 25 percent of American carriers. There also has been
speculation that Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc., may be interested in a combination with Continental.
   Lorenzo, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger
with another airline, according to a source close to the company who
asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an
investor group, possibly including SAS or another foreign carrier.
   SAS spokeswoman Barbara Levites and Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon, both in New York, declined comment on the matter Friday. An
Icahn associate didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
   Continental would carry a sale price of about $2 billion if it
were sold in its entirety, and Lorenzo may be trying to find out
what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested.
   ``The worst may be over and it surprises me he (Lorenzo) would be
considering a major sale,'' said Daniel Hersh, an analyst with
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.
   Lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy
sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling
Continental a hot property.
   A group led by California investor Alfred Checchi recently
acquired Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $4 billion, while
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. is being ardently pursued by
investor Marvin Davis, British Airways PLC and others.

   Cocoa futures prices plunged Friday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange as traders looked ahead to next month's meeting of
the International Cocoa Organization with an expectation of failure.
   On other markets, copper prices reached new contract highs, grain
and soybean futures plunged, precious metals declined, oil futures
were down and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Cocoa settled $37 to $47 lower with the contract for delivery in
September at $1,066 a metric ton.
   The selloff in cocoa futures followed ICO's revision of its
forecast for the 1988-1989 world cocoa surplus, raising the figure
by 40,000 metric tons to 263,000 metric tons from its May forecast.
   Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, said speculators led Friday's selloff.
   ``The market is looking forward to the International Cocoa
Organization meeting in London next month,'' Stevenson said.
``Perhaps the organization can come up with new price support
measures. But the principal players (in the market) are looking at
it as a likely failure.''
   The ICO meeting of cocoa producers and consumers is to take place
Sept. 11.
   Cocoa prices have been depressed in recent years by five
consecutive years of surplus crops. The surplus has hurt the
economies of major cocoa-producing nations such as the Ivory Coast.
   Copper futures hit new contract highs on New York's Commodity
Exchange as production problems around the world continue to push up
prices.
   Copper was up by 4.70 cents to 6.80 cents, with the August
contract at $1.373 a pound.
   In addition to a paralyzing strike in Peru, copper production is
hampered by a strike at the Highland Valley mines in British
Columbia, Canada; the bankruptcy of Mexico's Cananea mine, which is
expected to be closed for up to three months; and the shutdown of
the Bougainville mines in Papua New Guinea due to terrorist
activities by landowners.
   ``Current production problems are so severe the rally will have
to continue through early September,'' said William O'Neill, an
analyst with Elders Futues Inc. in New York.
   Grain and soybean futures were lower in quiet trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade due to forecasts for rain in the plains
states and the Ohio Valley over the weekend and expectations of more
precipitation next week.
   Slack export sales and a drop in processor demand also were cited
as a cause of the selloff in soybeans and corn.
   The selloff in the corn and soybean pits spilled over into wheat
futures, where the lack of new export sales also hurt prices.
   Wheat was 3\ cents to 6\ cents lower with September at $3.90{ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.32}
a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with September at
$1.34} a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cent to 16\ cents lower with
September at $5.79{ a bushel.
   Precious metal futures continued their retreat on the Comex, with
gold $3.70 to $3.90 lower with August at $360.70 a troy ounce;
silver was 6 cents to 7.4 cents lower with September at $5.115 a
troy ounce.
   Oil futures closed lower in listless trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The market is awaiting an injection of fresh news,'' said Jim
Ritterbusch, an analyst with Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area
oil distributor.
   Analysts say the general market tone is negative because of
overproduction by some members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 11 cents lower to 10 cents
higher with September at $17.94 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cents
lower to .24 cent higher with September at 51.43 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .28 cent to .85 cent lower with September at
53.30 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures where mixed in light trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with September
at 73.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .43 cent
lower with August at 83.67 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower
to .5 cent higher with October at 41.32 cents a pound; pork bellies
were .65 cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at 41.62 cents
a pound.

   The Australian holding company that
is trying to acquire United Artists from MGM-UA Communications says
it has assembled a group of 10 Asian and European investors to
finance the deal.
   Qintex Group said Thursday that the $600 million acquisition,
first announced March 31, is scheduled to close Sept. 30 with some

   Investors would buy combinations of common and preferred stock at
$5 per share to raise $500 million, while Qintex Group plans to
purchase 20 million common shares for $100 million, according to
Jonathan Lloyd, chief financial officer of Qintex Entertainment Inc.
   Kirk Kerkorian, who holds 82 percent of Beverly Hills-based
MGM-UA through his Tracinda Corp., would retain certain assets
considered MGM's. The transaction values MGM-UA at $1 billion.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell Friday after traders dumped
Treasury securities in a late-afternoon selloff, market watchers
said.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 11-32 of a point, or
$3.44 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when
prices fall, rose to 8.18 percent from 8.15 percent late Thursday.
   There was little economic news to move the market, analysts said.
Trading was slow until mid-afternoon, said Jay Goldinger, an
investment broker with Capital Insight Inc. in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Then, the sale of some mortgage issues prompted dealers to sell
Treasury issues, he said.
   ``Dealers bought the mortgage issues and tried to hedge them by
selling Treasuries,'' he said.
   Also, he said, ``The market has tended to sell off the last few
Fridays.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues fell 3-32 to 5-32 point, intermediate maturities
fell 7-32 point and long-term issues were down \ point to 11-32
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.78 to 1,174.61.
   In corporate trading, industrials were up slightly. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.07 to 328.61.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.22 percent as the
discount rose 3 basis points to 7.96 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.33 percent as the discount rose 6 basis points to
7.90 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.31 percent as the
discount rose 4 basis points to 7.72 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 15-16 percent, down from 9
1-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Four More Texas Banks Fall; Hibernia Arrives In Texas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hibernia Corp., a Louisiana bank holding company,
made its first entry into Texas on Thursday, buying one of four
banks shut down by regulators.
   Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth W. Littlefield on Thursday
shut down First State Bank of Pflugerville, blaming weak
underwriting standards for the bank's loan losses, writedowns of
other real estate and heavy volume of non-performing assets.
   Littlefield also closed Troup Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Troup and
Summit Bank of San Antonio, citing liberal lending practices and
other problems. Federal regulators shut Park Central Bank in Fort
Worth.
   All four banks were turned over the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. The closures brought to 108 the number of failed banks in
Texas this year; 113 failed in 1988.
   In all cases, branches of the failed banks will reopen Friday as
branches of new institutions.
   At Summit and Park Central, however, only insured deposits were
transferred, leaving holders of about $2.2 million in deposits to
await the sale of the banks' assets before they can recoup their
money.
   First State-Pflugerville had $32 million in assets. Hibernia paid
$26,000 for the 56-year-old bank's $32 million in deposits, plus
agreed to buy assets worth about $8.8 million.
   The FDIC will advance Hibernia National Bank in Texas $23.2
million in assistance, and retain a like amount of assets to try to
recoup its cost.
   Hibernia is the largest bank in Louisiana and 81st largest in the
nation.

<HEAD>Davis Outlines Bid; Analysts Say it Should Appeal to All</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California investor Marvin Davis on Friday
outlined his $6.19 billion bid to buy UAL Corp. with details that at
least one analyst said should please everyone involved.
   Davis said the financing package for the $275-a-share deal
includes $7 billion in bank financing and $1 billion in equity to
cover the acquisition of United Airlines' parent, refinance certain
debts, provide working capital and pay related expenses.
   ``In addition, Mr. Davis has stated his intention to pursue an
Employee Stock Ownership Plan, in which all employee and labor
groups would be invited to participate, thereby rewarding them for
their role in building UAL and providing them with an additional
opportunity to benefit from their continued efforts on behalf of the
company,'' a statement said.
   ``With this financing information, the UAL board should now be in
a position to take action on our proposal,'' Davis said.
   He said he has asked UAL to advise him of its decision by the
close of business on Aug. 31.
   ``The financing plan is entirely consistent with our goals for
UAL: it allows for the continued implementation of UAL's growth and
expansion plans, including new aircraft and capital equipment, but
does not contemplate the disposition of any UAL assets, nor any
`bust-up' of the company, in whole or in part,'' he said.
   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for Chicago-based UAL, declined to
comment on the plan.
   Also Friday, Davis met in his Los Angeles office with members of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
which represents the biggest share of United workers.
   Davis is seeking their support for his bid, and a spokesman said
the meeting was ``constructive.''
   ``The Machinists people made Mr. Davis aware of some of their
concerns with respect to labor, and he gave them some assurances
with respect to the future of the airline,'' said the Davis
spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
   He said both sides plan additional meetings to discuss Davis' bid.
   The unions representing United machinists and the carrier's
pilots are considered crucial to any sale.
   Davis' decision to outline his financing plans likely was aimed
in part at discouraging other potential bidders, said Louis
Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia.
   ``I think by announcing the full financing available ... he's
showing he could'' go even higher, said Marckesano.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Farmers Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday ruled against
Farmers Insurance Group's attempt to throw a wrench in takeover
plans by a British investment group.
   At issue is the right of a state agency, in this case the Texas
Insurance Commissioner, to review a takeover bid involving foreign
companies. Hoylake Investments of London has made an offer for
Farmers' parent, BAT Industries PLC, also based in Britain. Farmers
is based in California.
   Hoylake has filed lawsuits in Texas and eight other states
claiming that it is unconstitutional to subject Hoylake's takeover
bid to state regulatory review. The company's position is that the
Hoylake offer is strictly a British securities transaction out of
the reach of state regulatory review.
   Farmers had filed motions to dismiss Hoylake's case in Texas.
U.S. District Judge Walter Smith denied that request on Friday. At
the same time, Smith denied Hoylake's request for a preliminary
injunction against the state insurance commission review.
   Hoylake said it would appeal the judge's ruling as soon as
possible.
   Hoylake attorney Laurence Tribe characterized the takeover bid as
a ``wholly-foreign securities transaction.'' Subjecting it to state
agency reviews ``not only exceeds the constitutional limitations on
state authority, but imposes an unfair burden on foreign
companies,'' he said.
   Similar lawsuits have been filed in eight other states where
Farmers does business: California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona,
Ohio, Idaho, Illinois and Kansas. A Hoylake adviser said there have
been no rulings in those cases, which, like the Texas case, were
filed in late July.
   Hoylake launched the $21 billion takeover bid in July. BAT
promised an aggressive fight against the takeover, saying the
investor group was made up of ``destroyers.''

   A former railroad and oil company executive
was named Friday as chairman of Singer Co. to succeed corporate
raider Paul A. Bilzerian, who was convicted of securities fraud
charges.
   The election of Walter A. Drexel was announced by the board of
the Tampa-based defense contractor.
   Drexel was most recently the vice chairman and chief executive
officer of Burlington Northern Railroad. Before that, Drexel was
with Atlantic Richfield Co. for 23 years.
   Bilzerian was convicted in June of securities fraud arising from
information spun off from the Ivan Boesky insider trader scandal.
   Bilzerian's case was also the first felony prosecution of stock
``parking,'' in which parties try to conceal the sale or transfer of
securities.
   The takeover specialist was found guilty on nine counts of
breaking securities and tax laws and making false statements in
connection with three failed takeovers and one other transactions in
1985 and 1986.
   Bilzerian no longer has any links to Singer, said company
spokeswoman Janet Rogan.
   Singer also announced Friday the resignation of Robert Kent
Scott, senior vice president, general counsel and secretary.
