   James D. White, a reporter with The
Associated Press for 36 years and one of the ``China hands'' who
covered the Far East in the 1930s, has died of a heart attack. He
was 81.
   White died Thursday at Kentfield Rehabilitation Hospital in this
city about 10 miles north of San Francisco while being treated for
injuries from a fall. He lived in nearby Mill Valley.
   His last AP assigment before his retirement in 1972 was in the
San Francisco bureau.
   The Appleton, Mo., native graduated from the University of
Missouri School of Journalism, and went to work for the AP in what
was then called Peiping.
   White, who met and married his wife Jenifer in Peiping, covered
Inner Mongolia and other parts of the East until 1941, when World
War II broke out.
   The Whites, who were in Shanghai, were unable to leave for some
months. They finally left aboard a Swedish liner.
   On his repatriation to the United States, White was assigned to
the State and War departments in Washington. In 1945, he joined the
AP's San Francisco bureau. He wrote an interpretive column on world
events for five years, and edited news going to Far Eastern
newspapers.
   White is survived by a sister, Lucille Alexander, of Napa.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Aug. 31 in Corte Madera.

   THE U.S.-CANADA BORDER ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN (AP) _ The water in Lake
Champlain, knowing no national boundaries, flows freely between
Canada and the United States. So do hundreds of boaters, to the
chagrin of customs agents.
   ``A border is a border, whether it is the land, the air or the
lake,'' said Jean Paul Barriere, who runs the Canadian port of entry.
   Without a summer cruising permit, those leaving the cottage-lined
beaches on Missisquoi Bay in Venice en Quebec are supposed to stop
at the U.S. Customs Service house in Alburg Springs, which is all
but impossible to reach by water.
   It was slightly easier to get to Canadian Customs. Boaters could
stop at a dock just over the border and call officials in nearby
Phillipsburg.
   Until this year, boaters going in and out of the bay jutting into
Quebec from Vermont missed or ignored the notch in the trees that
marks the line. Last year all but five ``were forgetting about
reporting,'' said Barriere, laughing.
   To encourage respect for the border, Canada set up a floating
immigration station, a 20-by-40-foot blue and orange barge officials
say is a first.
   On a sunny day in the middle of the week, Canadian Customs
Officer Jean Pierre Fortin logged 11 boats crossing by early
afternoon. He has counted more than 1,000 since he took up his post
in a boat near the barge June 21.
   Fortin isn't necessarily looking for drug runners or illegal
aliens, though he's prepared for both. He also keeps watch for
people trying to escape paying Canadian taxes on boats by buying
them in the United States and taking them through the bay instead of
hauling them by land through customs stations.
   His main reason for floating in the bay is to make an afternoon
outing more pleasant by giving cruisers an easy way to report to
customs. Canadian officers are on the barge between 11 a.m. and 7
p.m. until mid-September.
   But for those who want to escape the bay for the open lake on the
Vermont side, getting to U.S. Customs remains a trial, and sometimes
a game of chicken.
   Two power boats, with Canadians aboard, stop at Fortin's post,
though technically they need only report at the U.S. station. One
couple already has a summer permit to take their boat as far south
as St. Albans Bay without a stop on each trip. But their son and a
friend, in the second boat, don't.
   ``Are the police down there?'' the father asks. Fortin doesn't
tell.
   The U.S. customs house is within sight, but the shallow water and
rocky beach pose a greater risk than the agents; both boats whizz
past.
   Fortin shrugs. He knows the boaters, and he isn't surprised they
took a chance for an afternoon's spin on the lake.
   But taking the chance, and perhaps being confronted by imposing
agents in uniform, is just the situation Thomas Ducharme, owner of
the growing Champlain Marina and a boat dealership, wants his
customers to avoid. U.S. officials are hard on Canadians, he says,
and difficulty reporting has cost him customers.
   When Ducharme opened his marina three years ago, he renewed a
local push for a dock at the U.S. house. But the bay was too shallow
and the idea grew for the floating station and Fortin's boat, which
is docked at Ducharme's marina.
   ``I did it for my pocket. I want my customers to cross the border
without any trouble,'' Ducharme said, adding that to go by the book,
he must take his customers overland to the U.S. station before
sending them off for the day.
   Tim Moran, assistant district director of the U.S. Customs
Service in St. Albans, acknowleges ``that the honest traveler would
be less apprehensive about crossing the border if they had a place
to check in.''
   An invitation to share the barge came too late for this year, but
U.S officials want to see how it works. The crossings logged by the
Canadians are more than Moran had expected, but numbers alone won't
justify a U.S. presence.
   ``It would be a balancing between the numbers and the perceived
threat,'' he said, adding that there is ``some smuggling activity on
the lake.''
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Coast Guard and customs officials
tied up at the barge to search boats under the Bush administration's
``zero tolerance'' drug policy. The six-hour duty brought the first
arrest of the season, a Quebec man on whose boat inspectors
allegedly found eight grams of marijuana.
   Fortin taps a pen on his log. Eleven boats have passed and he'll
radio Alburg Springs with an update. ``It's a big favor we're doing
them,'' he said.
   ``It is a big favor,'' agreed Noel Induni, of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service in St. Albans. ``The minute
you put someone there, it doesn't matter (if it) is a Canadian
officer, you get compliance.''

<TEXT>
   Women around the country see a new female-majority
government in West Berlin as a sign of a new age in West Germany and
a test case that could influence their political fortunes in the
future.
   Women hold eight of the 13 seats in the West Berlin Senate, the
city's governing body.
   While the coalition of leftist Social Democrats and
environmentalists has held together better than many had predicted
when it took office in March, it has been tainted by controversy.
   Anne Klein, the state minister for youth affairs, has been
accused of taking part in illegal gambling activities.
   Culture Minister Anke Martiny has come under fire in the press
following allegations that one of her women staffers misused office
contacts and mailing privileges to secure an apartment.
   But women defenders respond that what happened to the women is
nothing more than the kind of trouble men get into.
   ``I wouldn't want to understate the seriousness of such matters,
but it's fair to say that they are not problems specific to women
politicians,'' said Ingrid Hesse, a spokeswoman for the Social
Democratic Women's Organization, an arm of the Social Democratic
Party, which governs in coalition with an environmentalist group.
   ``The fact that a woman is discovered to have taken part in
something questionable doesn't detract from the undeniable
importance of this huge step forward for women,'' Ms. Hesse added.
   Peter Rudolph, a taxi driver in his 50s, tended to agree.
   ``People are always looking for excuses to complain about the
government, especially now with all those women,'' he said. ``They
aren't doing anything the male politicians weren't doing, but
everyone notices now.''
   The eight women senators caucus over croissants and coffee each
Tuesday morning in a ritual that has been called the ``Witches
Breakfast.''
   ``It is really quite productive, and it lets all these women blow
off steam so that it doesn't interfere with the whole Senate's
business,'' said Alice Uebe, chief adviser to Ms. Martiny and an
active the Social Democrat.
   The women are credited with pressing for changes aimed at
improving living conditions in this city of 2 million people tightly
ringed by communist East Germany.
   They have introduced measures to reduce air and noise pollution,
improve housing availability and to expand day-care opportunities
for the increasing numbers of West German women who work outside the
home.
   While many Berliners attribute the atmospheric changes to the
women's influence, they likewise are blamed for decisions and edicts
that don't sit well with the public.
   West Berlin's interior minister, Erich Paetzold, decided in July
to require that official correspondence be gender-neutral. For
example, a male resident is a Berliner, and a female is a
Berlinerin. The unisex term is BerlinerIn, with the second ``i''
capitalized.
   What has become known as the ``Big I'' decision has been widely
ridiculed as silliness resulting from the female majority in the
Senate. Hanna-Renate Laurien, a former senator of the out-of-power
Christian Democratic Union, called it ``perverse.''
   Monika Herrmann, one of the founding members of the women-only
Artemisia Hotel and art gallery in West Berlin, says the new
government has awakened the West German women's movement.
   But she and others also maintained that it has left some men
feeling defensive and threatened.
   ``For a long time many people have confused emancipation with
sexual alternativism,'' Ms. Herrmann said in an interview. ``Women
are doing things for themselves, and men fear their power is being
reduced.''
   A member of the city government's 35-women advisory council on
family and social affairs, Ms. Herrmann said the women in positions
of authority now recognize that they have to move carefully to
achieve what they want without undermiing their electoral support.
   Meanwhile, women politicians in other parts of the country keep a
close eye on West Berlin to gauge their own standing with voters.
   ``The Berliners have given the situation for political women a
step up, but we are seeing this in other areas of the country as
well, in smaller cities,'' observed Ingrid Sehrbrock, director of
the Women's Union of the Christian Democatic Union. ``What kind of
example the Berlin coalition poses remains to be seen, but it has
certainly raised everyone's consciousness.''

<HEAD>Scholars Dispute Ancient City's Role in Life of Jesus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival U.S. archaeological teams are
unearthing a major Roman-era city near Jesus' boyhood town of
Nazareth, but scholars are bitterly divided over how it may have
influenced his life and teachings.
   James F. Strange, professor of religious studies at the
University of South Florida in Tampa, said six seasons of digging
show the ancient hilltop city of Sepphoris was a bustling urban
center of 35,000 with colonnaded streets, a Roman garrison and a
theater.
   The city, he says, is certain to have had a major influence on
Jesus, who grew up only six miles away, even though the New
Testament makes no specific mention of Jesus visiting Sepphoris.
   ``The question is not so much whether he was here, but how many
times?'' said Strange, 51, as he rested under a fig tree near the
ruins of an ancient Jewish villa that he had recently excavated by
his 85-member expedition.
   The conclusion he has drawn is that Jesus was influenced at an
early age by a sophisticated Roman town with a signficant pagan
presence. As a consequence, he believes Jesus' teachings were as
attuned to urban audiences as to country folk.
   ``Does he presuppose an urban audience as much as a rural one?
The answer seems to be yes. ... I think we have to give up the
concept of a peasant Jesus,'' he said.
   Jesus' exposure to a multicultural society also was likely to
have had an impact on later teachings. ``It helps us understand how
it is that the ideas of Jesus took root so quickly in both gentile
and Jewish cultures,'' he said.
   Strange dates the 4,600-seat theater to the start of the first
century A.D. and says it may well be the reference point of some of
Jesus' sayings.
   For example, the Bible says Jesus cautioned against acting like
hypocrites by publicizing one's help to the needy and disfiguring
one's face while fasting so as to look somber.
   Strange said the references were puzzling until his team
determined that in ancient Greek hypocrites were actors and Jesus
had access to a theater.
   Most of Strange's conclusions were disputed by Eric Meyers, an
archaeologist from Duke University who heads a joint 5-year-old
expedition with Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His excavations are
often near but in different areas than where Strange is digging.
   Meyers argues Sepphoris, located 75 miles north of Jerusalem, was
a smaller city of about 15,000 to 20,000 at the time of Jesus. He
also contends there is no evidence of wide colonnaded streets, that
the theater was not built until the end of the first century A.D.
and there is no sign of Roman legionnaires or signficant numbers of
pagans until much later.
   Meyers said the signficance of Sepphoris lay primarily in its
history as a center of Jewish learning from the first to fourth
century A.D. During this period, Jewish scholars in Sepphoris,
including Rabbi Judah Hanasi, produced a major portion of the
Mishna, a codification of Jewish law and oral tradition.
   ``There is no way we can ever answer definitely whether Jesus
came here or not,'' said Meyers. ``But if there is an inference to
be gleaned on the life of Jesus, it is his acquaintance with the
edcucated and learned classes of Jewish people who lived here.''
   Twenty-three biblical scholars who toured the site during a
recent international conference on Galilean studies differed in
their views of Sepphoris.
   Sean Freyne, a New Testament scholar from Trinity College,
Dublin, said he believes Jesus purposely avoided big cities like
Sephhoris and directed his ministry in the Galilee to simple,
country people.
   ``My theory is that Jesus avoided Herodian centers, such as
Sepphoris. I think it would have been mentioned if Jesus had
ministered here or if the Jesus movement took root here,'' he said,
adding Jesus primarily evoked rural images.
   ``I think Jesus' message is addressed more to the people of the
land,'' said Freyne.
   Antonio Saldarini, a bible scholar from Boston College, said he
believed Jesus had visited the city.
   ``It would have been a big city with cosmpolitan life, some
Romans, and gaps between the poor in the village and the rich in the
city. But I don't think any of this would have been weird to Jesus
or beyond his experience. It wouldn't have been like visiting Rome.
It was still a Palestinian city,'' said Saldarini.

   MediaNews Group Inc. announced Tuesday it had

_ for an undisclosed amount.
   MediaNews also said it had sold The Journal-News of Hamilton,
Ohio, to Thomson Newspapers for an undisclosed amount. The deal was
made by MediaNews subsidiary Garden State Newspapers.
   ``The transaction allows Garden State to enter two of the fastest
growing markets in the country,'' William Dean Singleton, the

under its new owner to benefit from the strong strategic position
held by Thomson in Ohio.''
   Houston-based MediaNews owns more than 20 daily newspapers,
including The Houston Post and The Denver Post, spokeswoman Pat
Robinson said. The company also owns more than 25 weekly newspapers.
   The Potomac News has a circulation of 25,000, while the Las
Cruces newspaper has a circulation of about 20,000, according to the
Audit Bureau of Circulation.
   Singleton said he planned no dramatic changes at either
newspaper. ``The management all stays the same. We'll add our little
touches here and there,'' he said.
   Garden State is owned by Singleton, MediaNews co-owner Richard B.

<HEAD>Two Chinese, One Soviet Dancer Leave Festival To Defect, Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Chinese dancers and a member of a
Soviet troupe apparently defected to the United States after
appearing in a Utah folk festival, police said Tuesday.
   The three women, two from the People's Republic of China and one
from the Ukraine, left their American host families' homes at
separate times but later telephoned the families to inform them they
had defected and were safe, said Springville Police Sgt. Dave Caron,
himself a host for two Soviet dancers.
   Both cases were being handled by the FBI and the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service, and the dancers' whereabouts were
unknown, he said.
   The Chinese women, identified as Chen Li, 24, and Zhe Qian, 27,
both from Guizhou province in southeast China, disappeared Friday.
   The Soviet woman, Svetlana Kirenko, 32, of the Donetsk region
just north of the Black Sea, refused to join her troupe, which was
boarding a bus for Salt Lake International Airport early Tuesday,
Caron said.
   ``Early this morning, when it was time to go, she told the host
family that she did not intend to return to the Soviet Union and she
wanted to defect. She refused to get in the car or put her suitcase
in the car to go where the bus was picking up the dancers,'' he said.
   Kirenko would not leave the house, he said, and when the host
family and other Soviet dancers went inside a short time later to
talk to her, they found her gone.
   Tour organizers were upset, ``but it's not like they were angry.
They were concerned,'' Caron said. ``They realized the impact of a
choice like that. This lady has basically decided to give up her
entire life to come to America. They were concerned about her
well-being.
   ``They were primarily concerned that the lady made the decision
on her own and that is really what she wanted to do,'' he added.
   The women were among several hundred dancers from various foreign
countries appearing in the World Folk Fest in Springville, about 60
miles south of here, which began Aug. 12 and ended Monday.
   Springville police turned the matter over to federal authorities,
Caron said. FBI spokesman Tim Screen said he could not comment on
the matter. INS administrators, whose office was closed Tuesday
night, could not be reached.
   Caron said it wasn't immediately known how the women fled or if
they had help.

   NBC's comic look at listener-supported radio
got enough viewer support to land in fifth place in the Nielsen
ratings.
   The Thursday preview of ``FM'' was in the Top 10 with five other
NBC sitcoms and four from ABC, as comedy took over the ratings for
the second week.
   ``FM,'' starring Robert Hays, is set among the eccentrics of a
Washington public radio station. The show will move into its regular
time slot tonight.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was first for the week ended Aug. 20, closely
followed by ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   NBC won the week with an average of 12.0 in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
survey. ABC and CBS tied at 9.6 each. It was NBC's 61st straight win.
   For the season to date, since Sept. 19, 1988, NBC leads with an
average of 14.6. ABC is second with 11.7 and CBS is third with 11.6.
The rating is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes
with television in the United States. The share is the percentage of
sets in use.
   More people watched the three networks last week. Their share of
the audience was 59 last week, up from 56 the week before. It's the
best three-network share since the week of June 19.
   CBS had only three shows in the first 30. They were ``Murder, She
Wrote'' in 13th place, ``60 Minutes'' tied for 15th and ``If
Tomorrow Comes'' Part II in 20th place.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's
``The Golden Girls'' special, ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' NBC's
``FM,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ABC's
``Who's the Boss?,'' NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ABC's ``Anything But
Love.''
   The regular ``Golden Girls'' tied for 11th and an ``Empty Nest''
special was 18th. A special showing of ``Knight &amp; Daye,'' another
NBC summer show that has not done well in the ratings, was 13th.
   NBC also previewed a fall Saturday morning show, ``Saved By the
Bell.'' The live-action show was 47th.
   CBS had its only victory by placing highest among the evening
news show with 8.7. ABC and NBC tied for second at 8.4 each.

   When Gov. John R. McKernan's mother walked
into a popular capital deli and insisted a sandwich be named after
her son, the owner obliged.
   But sandwich man Michael Burns first made sure the menu entry _ a
turkey sandwich _ didn't offend the chief executive.
   ``We've got other turkeys. We've got a turkey named after veteran
legislator Dan Hickey, a good legislator. But I sent a messenger
over to the governor's office to ask. He thought it was fine,'' said
Burns from behind the orange counter at Burnsie's Lunch.
   His spokesman, Willis Lyford, said McKernan was delighted with
the honor.
   ``As long as it's not baloney,'' Lyford added.
   About a block from the Statehouse complex and gubernatorial
mansion, the lunch shop has a back wall covered with comic
illustrations of the many choices. Customers need only point, Burns
said. Some are named after past and present politicians who are
caricatured by Walter Winchester of Augusta.
   ``Joe Brennan was governor when I came here, of course we became
friendly,'' said Burns, recalling a visit by the two-term governor.
``We talked for a while, then I said, `We've got to have a sandwich
named after you.'''
   The ``Big Governor Joe,'' a popular item at Burnsies, is
prominently advertised.
   ``Well, Mrs. McKernan came in one day and saw that and said,
`Where's my son's sandwich?'
   ``I told her next time she came in, she'd see the sign right up
there,'' said Burns.
   The Duke's Special, named after a capital barber famous for his
informal _ but usually accurate _ political polls, led to a
situation that Burns characterized as ``really quite comical.''
   ``This lady came in, she had all these Dukakis buttons on her.
She jumped up and down at that sandwich, she said she wanted to kiss
me,'' he said. ``I didn't tell her it was for a hard-working local
guy.''

   Engineers, professors and a Fortune
500 company have been assembled to flush out malfunctioning toilets
in south Florida.
   The problem, in part, is an 80-cent rubber seal that
deteriorates, causing toilets to run or stop flushing. A leading
manufacturer of the seal, hoping to solve the mystery, has given a
$4,000 grant to a water-quality researcher at Florida International
University.
   ``The university is as puzzled as we are on the exact problem,''
said Mitchell Kleppe, Florida representative for Fluidmaster Co. of
Anaheim, Calif. ``It has not been able to pin anything down on the
exact cause.''
   For three years, the leaky and malfunctioning toilets have
affected nearly 95 percent of the homes in Palm Beach, Broward and
Dade counties, said Kleppe.
   He said the company is the world's largest manufacturer of the
seal.
   The quarter-size seals fail about every six months in south
Florida, but in most parts of the country they last up to five
years, he said.
   The seal is part of a valve that triggers the toilet to fill or
empty the tank. When the seal malfunctions, it swells and prevents
the valve from working, often leaving the noise of water running in
the tank.
   Besides the university study, the manufacturer is conducting
tests at Fort Lauderdale's water plants and is teaming up with
California engineers and makers of rubber products, such as the
Fortune 500's Du Pont, he said.

   The tourism industry at this seaside
resort, the summer playground of China's leaders, is struggling to
recover from the spring military crackdown on students.
   The violent June 3-4 suppression of students protesting for
democratic reform in Beijing not only scared away foreign tourists
but has kept many Chinese from traveling.
   In addition, an economic austerity program that began last fall
has meant Chinese have less money for vacations. Many government
employees have canceled their vacations this year.
   The tourists who came to frolic on the beaches of the Bohai Sea
about 180 miles northeast of Beijing have had plenty of room this
summer.
   Even China's top leaders, who usually spend all of August here,
have made only brief visits. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping reportedly
is the only one who has stayed on.
   Party chief Jiang Zemin, who normally would be here with
government leaders plotting the nation's course, is campaigning to
boost the party's image, traveling to the provinces, visiting
factories and eating in workers' cafeterias.
   ``Usually, these places are filled,'' said a taxi driver
gesturing to private guesthouses in a deserted area of town several
miles from the center.
   In past years, the clear water and fresh seabreezes of Beidaihe
drew visitors from all over the country.
   Work units from northeastern China have hostels in Beidaihe for
selected employees to relax for a week or more.
   ``Usually, it's a sea of people,'' said a tanned junior high
school student.
   A few spots along Beidaihe's 3.7-mile-long beachfront were
crowded, especially the public beach near downtown.
   But even in the crowded areas, stacks of unrented red and blue
air mattresses indicated there were fewer people than normal.
   Along the Beidaihe coastline, sunbathers dotted the beach, the
men in surprisingly skimpy briefs and women in modest one-piece
suits.
   Older beachgoers crouched under umbrellas, hiding from the sun,
but the younger ones played in the sand and water.
   Perceptions of how bad the situation is vary.
   The taxi driver said on condition of anonymity that tourism this
summer was down by two-thirds.
   Sun Dali, an employee at the Jinshan Hotel, Beidaihe's fanciest,
said there were so few guests in June that some temporary hotel
employees were let go, but occupancy in August has been 100 percent.
   Beidaihe's tourism office said it didn't have statistics on the
number of visitors this year, but official reports in mid-July said
there were 1 million fewer tourists than last year, when 5 million
people visited.
   The loss is felt by both the government and the small-time
private entrepreneurs who run guest houses that charge $1.35 a night
for a bed or sell ice cream bars for a few cents on the roadside.
   Last year, 60 percent of the area's tax revenues came from
tourism. And the income of many town residents comes from the summer
tourism trade.
   An elderly man renting air mattresses, inner tubes and a rubber
raft on the beach said he made less than $100 in June, compared to
thousands in past Junes.
   At the Come-In Restaurant, a man serving at the counter said
there will be only about 20 days of good business in August before
cooler temperatures and the start of the school year sends the
tourists home.

   Two pro-choice candidates
outdistanced an anti-abortion candidate in a Republican primary
Tuesday to fill a vacant state Assembly seat, putting them in a
runoff next month.
   The primary was South Carolina's first election since the U.S.
Supreme Court last month gave states more latitude to restrict
abortion.
   According to unofficial results, former legislative aide Holly
Cork led with 2,654 votes to 2,226 for developer David Ames and
1,805 for Robert Graves, a businessman who opposes abortion, said
Beaufort County Republican Party Chairman Frank Gibson.
   The result was expected to be finalized Thursday, when any
questionable votes could be challenged. If the vote stands as
expected, a runoff will be held Sept. 5 between Miss Cork and Ames,
Gibson said.
   Miss Cork, who was bidding to succeed her father, the late Rep.
William N. Cork, favors a woman's right to abortion, as does Ames.
Graves opposes abortion.
   Miss Cork said after the election that the national attention
focused on abortion, ``made the voters here think about it more,''
but said she wasn't sure if it played a role in the primary.
   Ames said the issue was important, but said it would probably be
less of a factor in the runoff because both he and Miss Cork are
pro-choice. He said such issues as real-estate taxes, uncontrolled
growth and traffic, and drugs would become more important.
   Graves said his stand on abortion may have cost him votes.
   The issue had dominated the campaign, transcending the
environment, education, taxes and crime. The General Assembly is
expected to decide whether it will place more restrictions on
abortions when it reconvenes in January.
   About 30 percent of voters turned out, Gibson said, compared to
50 percent to 65 percent in previous primaries. He said it was
``really hard to tell'' whether the abortion issue was the deciding
factor in the race.
   Miss Cork, 23, a former legislative aide to U.S. Rep. Arthur
Ravenel, R-S.C., said voters overwhelmingly favor abortion rights.
She said her position was based on ``personal beliefs'' not
``political expediency.''
   Ames, 45, said he favors legalized abortion and would not support
legislation to restrict a woman's right to abortion. ``But I feel
that through education we have to reduce the need for abortions,''
he said.
   Graves, 51, opposes abortion but favors exceptions for rape,
incest and to save the life of a mother.
   Cork, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982,
died in June of a heart attack.

<HEAD>Study: Tough-On-Drunks Sentences Not Enough to Deter Drunken Driving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A small-town Ohio judge isn't getting anywhere
with his nationally publicized bid to reduce drunken driving by
imposing stiff sentences on offenders, researchers say.
   One problem is that although New Philadelphia Judge Edward
O'Farrell routinely orders first-time offenders to jail, the local
facility is so full they don't have to serve their time for at least
a year, said the study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.
   ``I think I've known that all along,'' O'Farrell said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``You can't do it alone.''
   The study compared drunken driving statistics and interviews with
motorists in New Philadelphia against those of nearby Cambridge,
Ohio, where the sentencing is not as stiff.
   Researchers said their surveys ``failed to show less drinking and
driving in New Philadelphia.''
   ``Even a determined judge like Edward O'Farrell is incapable of
creating the needed certainty of punishment on his own,'' the report
said. ``Limited jail space remains an important constraint on the
O'Farrell policies.''
   Farrell's anti-drunken driving campaign has received publicity on
numerous national television programs and in newspapers and
magazines.
   In drunken driving cases since 1982, the judge has routinely
handed out 15-day jail sentences to first-time offenders; imposed a
standard $750 fine; rejected plea bargains; and required the
vehicles of restricted drivers to be tagged with a distinctive
red-on-yellow license plate.
   In Cambridge, 40 miles south of New Philadelphia, drunken drivers
usually get sentences of three days or less in special education
camps.
   The report showed motorists in the two towns had a good sense of
their relative chances of being sentenced to jail if caught driving
under the influence. But similar numbers of drunken drivers were
found in both communities during anonymous spot-checks that included
breath tests.
   Before changing their driving habits drinkers have to be
convinced there's a strong likelihood of getting caught and going to
jail, the report said.
   ``A Judge O'Farrell, to be fully effective, needs a similarly
committed community, willing to deploy the resources necessary to
support the struggle to reduce drunk driving,'' the report said.
   New Philadelphia has just begun work on a new 100-bed jail, but
in the meantime there's a 12 to 18-month waiting list to get into
the existing 19-bed facility.
   The shortage of jail space tends to counteract O'Farrell's tough
sentences; once sentenced, drunken drivers must wait to serve their
time and if they wait long enough the sentence gets suspended, the
study said.
   ``On a first offender now I am simply unable to get anybody into
the jails,'' O'Farrell said. ``If I don't have a jail to put
somebody away, I can't follow up. That has been disheartening to
me.''
   ``People know that the jails are filled,'' O'Farrell said. ``John
Q. and Mary Q. Citizen look at the bottom line: what's going to
happen to me.''
   So even in New Philadelphia, renowned as home to a court that's
tough on drunken drivers, people don't see much chance of
encountering a police officer while intoxicated and then of going to
jail, he said.
   ``There just aren't enough people out there to adequately cover
the problem,'' O'Farrell said. ``On any given shift in New
Philadelphia there may be only three (police cars) out there.''

<HEAD>More Diversity on TV These Days, but Blacks are Usually Rich, Untroubled</HEAD>

   Television shows are avoiding the blatant
racial stereotypes of the past, but most blacks portrayed still are
atypical _ rich, happy and living lives free of bias, says a study
of network entertainment.
   ``Poverty is invisible'' on network shows, concluded Wider
Opportunities for Women today in its 12th in a series of reports on
the way women and minorities are portrayed in the media.
   ``TV denies the reality of racism in America,'' said Sally
Steenland, who wrote the report. ``Racial tension is commonplace in
the real world, but virtually invisible among white and minority
characters on entertainment television.''
   Wider Opportunities for Women is a non-profit group working to
promote equality in the workplace. The study was financed by the
Ford Foundation.
   An analysis of more than 150 episodes from 30 network
entertainment series shown last spring found many more blacks
portrayed and a greater diversity in their characters in the years
since the Kerner Report, written following the riots of 1968,
faulted television as ``almost totally white in appearance and
attitude.''
   Now, almost a third of all prime-time programs have minority
characters, the study found. Most are blacks; Hispanics, Asians and
Indians still are only sporadically featured.
   Blacks on the screen do not live lives comparable to blacks in
the real world, the study said.
   On TV, it said, nine out of 10 minority characters are rich or at
least solidly middle class, whereas in reality more than 40 percent
of minority men and 60 percent of minority women live on less than
$10,000 a year.
   The report said 93 percent of the producers of the 30 shows were
white. It cited that as the reason for what it called the
unrealistic portrayals on television.
   ``If television's integrated world is a happy one; if racism does
not intrude into TV's workplace or neighborhood; if minority
characters are nearly identical to their white buddies, the reason
might be because white producers and writers are creating characters
and developing plots out of their own experience and mindset,'' it
said.
   All viewers are the losers when minority characters are created
almost exclusively by white writers and producers, the report argued.
   ``White viewers lose because they rarely see their reflection
from someone else's eyes,'' it said. ``In addition, they are
absorbing images of others which lack dimension and authenticity.
   ``Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American viewers suffer
because the complexity and reality of their lives are distorted into
something that is unrecognizable.''
   Also, minority characters created by white producers and writers
lose their uniqueness, the report said.
   ``The overall impression the viewer receives from most of these
minority characters who mix so easily with their white colleagues is
that they might as well be white themselves,'' it said.
   ``Almost nowhere can the viewer detect any distinct racial
identity. In fact, it sometimes seems as if the characters are
actually white and are merely unconventionally cast with minority
actors playing the parts.''
   That is not always the case, though, it said, citing shows like
``LA Law,'' ``Miami Vice,'' ``21 Jump Street,'' ``Tour of Duty'' and
``China Beach'' as among those in which ``racial differences are
acknowledged and greater ethnic diversity does appear.''
   The report also found some value in black situation comedies
which show ``a friendly world where problems are manageable and
negativity can be turned around.''
   It could be argued that such a harmonious picture of black life,
showing people striving and succeeding without having to overcome
racial barriers, ``paints the world the way it should be'' and
``offers relief from the way the world really is,'' it said.

<HEAD>$50 Billion May Not be Enough to Bail Out S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $50 billion savings and loan bailout signed
by President Bush this month probably isn't large enough, federal
regulators are indicating after a look at new figures on the
industry's health.
   The nation's 2,934 S&amp;Ls lost $3.7 billion in the April-June
quarter, up from $3.5 billion in the first three months of the year,
the Office of Thrift Supervision said Tuesday. It was the biggest
loss since the record $4.1 billion loss in the second quarter of
1988.
   The latest discouraging report came just two weeks after
President Bush signed legislation authorizing $50 billion to close
or sell failed institutions over the next 26 months.
   During the six months leading up to the bill's approval,
administration officials repeatedly said they believed $50 billion
would be adequate, although they couldn't guarantee it.
   Now, regulators' statements indicate that private analysts
probably are right in predicting the administration will have to
come back to Congress for more money.
   David C. Cooke, executive director of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
the new agency charged with the cleanup, said Tuesday the $50
billion won't cover much more than 500 failed S&amp;Ls. The agency now
has 264 insolvent S&amp;Ls in its control after closing seven this month.
   ``If it gets up to 500, it will probably be awfully tight. I can
tell you that,'' Cooke told reporters at a luncheon. ``Our best hope
is ... (it will be) a little more than 400.''
   Meanwhile, James R. Barth, chief economist of the Office of
Thrift Supervision, which regulates the industry, said at a news
conference that he expects ``upwards of 600'' failed S&amp;Ls will
eventually be transferred from his jurisdiction to Cooke's agency.
   Barth said 401 institutions already were insolvent at the end of
June, up from 394 three months earlier.
   He estimated another 1,200 S&amp;Ls don't meet stricter standards in
the bill requiring institutions to have more capital as a buffer
between losses and the S&amp;L insurance fund. Many of those will
survive by shrinking, retaining profits or attracting outside
investors, but others won't.
   ``Are there circumstances under which the $50 billion is
enough?'' Barth asked in a telephone interview. ``It's possible
under very favorable circumstances. But, any sort of adverse
circumstances make it increasingly likely that additional funds will
have to be found to deal with insolvent institutions.''
   For the first half of this year, losses were mounting at a rate
that could make 1989 the worst year for the savings industry since
the Depression, topping 1988's record of $13.4 billion.
   Most of the loss this year is attributed to recognition of
problems with loans that started going sour long ago. But private
analysts point out that for the first time since last year's
January-March quarter, the thrift industry is failing to make a
profit on current operations.
   The second quarter operating loss was $400 million, down from a
$400 million profit in the first quarter, a swing attributed to
rising interest rates earlier this year.
   Rising interest rates help push S&amp;Ls into the red because they
have to pay more to attract deposits even though earnings on
mortgages already in their portfolio remain flat.
   ``The operating loss figures show the extent to which this
industry is still very vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations,''
said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. is trying to bring down the cost of
deposits by injecting $15 billion to $16 billion in government funds
into ailing thrifts before Sept. 30, Cooke said. The agency
estimates that will cut losses by about $500 million a year.
   In the second quarter, as in the past, losses were concentrated
in Texas, but for the first time California and Arizona rivaled the
oil-producing states, which have been plagued for several years by
bank and S&amp;L failures.
   Texas losses totaled $1.3 billion, a little more than a third of
the $3.5 billion in red ink recorded in the state during the same
period a year ago.
   California thrifts lost $950 million, the second-worst total in
the nation, and a sharp turnaround from profits of $127 million a
year ago. S&amp;Ls from Arizona, which is suffering a real estate
downturn, lost $515 million, a marked deterioration from the $58
million loss a year ago.
   Barth said the California loss was heavily influenced by two
large institutions which were taken over by regulators and forced to
recognize losses from sour loans.
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Los Angeles posted a $788
million loss, while Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills lost $332
million, he said.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Critical of Exxon Oil Spill Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are criticizing a government
plan calling for all studies on damage caused by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill off the Alaskan coast to be completed by February.
   ``This plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm to
the environment and a limited recovery of damages from Exxon,''
Sarah Chasis, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said Tuesday.
   By February, Ms. Chasis said, there still will be oil on Alaska
beaches, causing additional damage.
   The extent of damage on species such as the bald eagle and salmon
may not be known for years, she said, because the young born this
year and exposed to the oil won't return to the region for three or
four years.
   ``Only then will the extent of the damage begin to be known,''
she said.
   The timetable for completion of the studies was included Tuesday
in a 258-page government outline on how it will proceed with the
staggering task of determining how much Exxon Corp. should pay to
restore the Alaska environment following damage from the March 24
tanker spill that dumped 11 million gallons of oil into pristine
Prince William Sound.
   The document released by the Interior Department made no dollar
assessment of damages and suggested in only broad terms what studies
should be made to determine the effect of the spill on wildlife,
birds, fish and other natural resources.
   However, the report directs that all environmental studies to be
used in determining damage should be completed over the next six
months.
   ``No further studies will be conducted after Feb. 28, 1990,''
unless a government trustee council and scientific and legal review
groups determine they are needed, the report said.
   Interior spokesman Bob Walker acknowledged there were discussions
on whether to allow longer environmental studies, but that there was
a concern such studies would drag out the process.
   ``The trustees wanted to get to restoration as fast as possible
and not take a leisurely approach to studying whatever needs to be
studied,'' Walker said.
   The proposed timetable and blueprint for determining damages was
prepared by government trustees _ representatives of three federal
agencies and the state of Alaska _ who are charged with making the
long-term damage assessments.
   Interested parties were asked to comment before the end of
September, after which the blueprint becomes final. A narrowing of
the assessment to include damage estimates in dollars and the cost
of restoration is not expected until late next year.
   Ms. Chasis said there also is concern that the plan does not make
clear the role of Exxon in the assessment plan.
   Exxon executives have said they want to participate in the
determination of damage to wildlife and natural resources as a
result of spill. The government document said a decision on whether
to allow Exxon to participate and if so, to what extent, has not
been made.

<HEAD>Increase in Feed Grains Will Lower Livestock Feeding Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp increase in 1989 output of corn and
other feed grains will lower livestock feeding costs and stimulate
domestic use, but the Agriculture Department says foreign
competition also is picking up.
   On a tonnage basis, total U.S. feed grains output _ corn,
sorghum, barley and oats _ is estimated at 217.6 million metric
tons, based on Aug. 1 production estimates announced earlier this
month.
   That's up 46 percent from last year's drought-reduced harvest of
149.2 million tons. Part of the increase is due to a 14 percent
boost in harvested acreage.
   But total feed use in 1989-90 is expected to be about 226 million
tons, up 5 million tons from the 1988-89 forecast. Domestic feeding
is forecast to increase by almost 9 million tons, but export may
drop because of greater foreign competition.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn. The USDA uses metric tons to measure overall feed supplies
and use, and bushels when referring to specific grains.
   ``With use likely to exceed production, U.S. stocks (in 1989-90)
may drop more than a tenth,'' the department's Economic Research
Service said Tuesday. ``However, prices are also expected to decline
because of lower loan rates and reduced drought psychology in the
market.''
   World production of coarse grains such as corn is projected at
800 million tons, up 10 percent from 1988-89, the report said. That
includes U.S. output.
   ``While (total) foreign production may be nearly unchanged,
significant increases are expected in the major competing exporters,
except for the (European Economic Community) and South Africa,'' it
said. ``A tightening in the world coarse grain supply-use situation
appears likely in 1989-90.''
   The report said world feed grains consumption is expected to
increase in 1989-90, exceeding production for the third straight
year.
   In a related government report, the Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said its weekly survey for Aug. 14-20 showed that the
nation's corn crop was ``in good to fair condition'' and that 68
percent of the acreage was in the dough stage of kernel development
or beyond.
   An estimated 26 percent of the corn was in the final dent stage
of kernel development.
   Both the dough and dent stages are lagging the usual pace for
corn development in most of the major production states, the report
said.
   The facility, operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, reports on weather and crop conditions during the
season. The USDA will issue the next production estimate Sept. 12.
   Soybeans were said to be in ``mostly fair to good'' condition,
with about 92 percent of the crop's bloom completed, 2 percentage
points behind the average. Seed pods were set on 76 percent of the
acreage, 5 percentage points behind the usual pace.
   The report also said:
   _Cotton was generally fair to good, with 90 percent of the
acreage setting bolls, 6 percentage points behind normal. Bolls were
opening on 10 percent of the acres, 5 percentage points behind the
average.
   _Sorghum was in mostly good to fair condition, with 70 percent of
the acreage headed, 11 points behind normal; 29 percent was turning
color, an indication of ripening, 5 percentage points later than
normal.
   _Rice was in mostly good to fair condition, with 77 percent of
the acreage headed, 4 percentage points behind the usual pace.
   _Peanuts were mostly good in Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas,
with digging starting in early Georgia fields.
   _Tobacco was fair to good in Kentucky, with 23 percent of the
burley cut, compared with an average of 18 percent at this time.
North Carolina tobacco was fair to good, with flue-cured harvest at
47 percent, 5 percentage points ahead of normal.
   _Pastures and livestock ``remained in mostly good to excellent
condition in the Delta and Southeast, and were generally fair, at
best, elsewhere.'' Cattle were moved to late summer ranges in Idaho,
and Nebraska producers are supplementing pastures or moving cattle
elsewhere for better feed.

<HEAD>Impeachment Witness Balks at Senate Questions, Judge Orders Him Jailed</HEAD>

   Disbarred lawyer William Borders will go to
jail Friday unless he answers questions from senators gathering
evidence in the Alcee Hastings impeachment case, a federal judge
says.
   ``This court ... confines him to the custody of the U.S. marshal
until he purges himself,'' District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
said Tuesday after holding Borders in civil contempt of court at the
request of the Senate.
   The order came hours after Borders refused to answer 10 questions
from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., about impeachment charges against
Hastings, a 52-year-old U.S. District judge from Florida.
   ``We do not have any interest in putting you in jail,'' Specter
told Borders, ``but that is the established procedure.''
   Borders has been granted immunity from prosecution for what he
might tell the committee and ordered by a federal court to testify.
But he still balked, saying the questions violated his
constitutional rights, including the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   The husky, gray-bearded Borders, a Washington power broker in the
1970s, arrived in court with two hefty paperback books, apparently
bought over the lunch hour. Jackson, however, gave him until 10 a.m.
Friday to put his affairs in order before surrendering to U.S.
marshals.
   Specter posed his questions to Borders at a session of the Senate
committee gathering evidence in the Hastings case.
   Hastings is accused of plotting with Borders in 1981 to obtain a
$150,000 payoff and lying about it to a jury that acquitted him in
1981. Borders was convicted in a separate trial, disbarred and
served 33 months in prison.
   Despite the jury acquittal, the House in August 1988 approved 17
articles of impeachment against Hastings, charging him with the
payoff conspiracy, perjury and improper disclosure of information
obtained from a court-approved wiretap.
   The committee will produce a report on the evidence against
Hastings, and the Senate then will vote on whether to remove him
from the bench.
   Under Jackson's order, Borders could purge himself of contempt
and get out of jail by answering the committee's questions.
Otherwise, he most likely would remain behind bars until the Senate
votes on impeaching Hastings. That vote is expected before
mid-October.
   The questions posed by Specter on Tuesday ranged from whether
Hastings received any payoff money to the alleged relationship
between Borders and the late Florida Mafia boss Santo Trafficante.
   Borders replied to each question by citing a statement he made
July 27 when he also refused to testify before the committee. The
statement said the questions violated his rights.
   Borders also objected on the grounds that with Specter the only
senator on hand for the session a quorum of the committee was not
present.
   Specter, however, reminded him of a resolution providing that one
senator constitutes a quorum for purposes of hearing testimony from
Borders. The measure was approved before lawmakers left for their
August recess.

   The neighborhood stray dragged a shopping
bag containing $25,000 worth of crack into a woman's driveway,
prompting State Police Sgt. Don Cook to say:
   ``You've heard of drug pushers. This was a drug puller.''
   The dog, which roams around the neighborhood in which the woman
lives, left the bag in her driveway Monday night. Cook on Tuesday
said she was going to throw it out with the trash Tuesday, but
looked in the bag before tossing it out.
   ``It had these strange vials that she couldn't identify. She
thought they might be drugs, so she called us,'' Cook said.
   Some 160 vials containing the highly potent, smokeable form of
cocaine were in two plastic bags inside the shopping bag.
   ``And no telling how many vials the dog might have lost while it
was dragging it,'' Cook said. ``It may have fallen from a car, it
may have been stashed under a house, whatever.
   ``I'd say some individual is very unhappy at the moment.''

<HEAD>Bunker Hunt Says He Can't Remember Much About Partnership Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Bunker Hunt says he signed so many
papers after the 1980 silver collapse began consuming his legendary
fortune that he can't recall much about documents at the center of a
$155 million dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``It seems incredible that a person who signed documents
contemplating and covering vast amounts of money and large amounts
of activities ... states he has no idea what I'm talking about,''
IRS lawyer Deborah Butler told U.S. Tax Court Judge Jules G. Korner
III.
   ``Miss Butler,'' Hunt responded Tuesday from the witness stand,
``if you had signed as many thousands of documents as I have, you
might be as vague as I am.''
   At issue are documents Hunt signed to form a 1980 partnership and
to dissolve it two years later.
   Hunt and his younger brothers, William Herbert and Lamar, formed
the partnership with their family's Placid Oil Co. to repay debts
from the silver price collapse totaling as much as $2 billion.
   The brothers, whose fortunes have fallen since their investments
in the silver market soured, are contesting more than $300 million
in 1982 taxes the IRS says are due from the dissolution of the
partnership.
   The IRS contends that Nelson Bunker Hunt owes about $155 million
in 1982 taxes, and that William Herbert and Lamar owe more than $158
million and $505,377 respectively.
   The IRS contends the partnership was an elaborate sham to provide
financial relief to the brothers when they didn't have cash to repay
their silver debts. After it was dissolved, the IRS says the result
was taxable income to the brothers.
   Lawyers for the Hunts, however, contend the partnership was a
legitimate business and dispute that $300 million in taxes was owed.
   Nelson Bunker Hunt, subpoenaed by the government, testified
Tuesday that the partnership agreement tied up all his assets,
including furniture in his home, and ``made it impossible to do
business.''
   Under the agreement, a consortium of banks loaned Placid $1.1
billion, of which $824 million was contributed to the partnership to
repay the silver debts. The brothers, in turn, contributed North
Dakota coal properties, silver and gold stocks.
   ``I was glad to have it dissolved because it was a very
unworkable situation,'' Hunt testified.
   According to testimony, the banks couldn't lend the brothers
money directly because of a Federal Reserve ban on loans for silver
investments imposed about the time silver prices collapsed.
   The judge has ruled that testimony in the lengthy non-jury trial,
in its fourth week, must conclude by Sept. 1.

<HEAD>Justice Department Files Asbestos Lawsuits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A barrage of lawsuits claiming unsafe handling
of cancer-causing asbestos in buildings across the country may
represent only a fraction of the violations occurring every day,
federal officials say.
   One of the 13 lawsuits filed Tuesday said the New York City Board
of Education and seven demolition contractors didn't give the
Environmental Protection Agency a chance to see if asbestos was
removed properly from 130 school buildings.
   ``The EPA has filed this action because we were precluded from
inspecting this work,'' said John F. Dolinar, an EPA lawyer. ``We
cannot say whether it was removed properly or improperly. We have no
way of knowing.''
   The suit accused the city education department of failing to tell
EPA officials that it had contracted with a number of companies to
remove asbestos from the schools. Seven companies also were cited
for not reporting their work.
   The lawsuits filed by the Justice Department seek unspecified
damages against 45 companies, individuals and some local officials,
alleging that federal health requirements weren't followed when
asbestos was removed from buildings.
   EPA officials say those cited are believed to represent only a
fraction of similar violations that occur daily across the country.
   The Justice Department said it has filed more than 100 similar
lawsuits over the last five years involving $2.5 million in
penalties.
   The EPA estimated that up to half the asbestos-connected
demolitions and renovations conducted nationwide may violate
procedures required by federal air pollution laws. The agency last
year was notified of more than 50,000 asbestos-related projects.
   ``Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a message
to those who ignore the law,'' said Henry Habicht, EPA deputy
administrator. ``Asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans and
it can be a killer. Companies which think `business as usual' means
ignoring the laws which protect public health will be prosecuted.''
   The federal Clean Air Act and other laws require that asbestos be
removed before demolition begins, that the cancer-causing material
be wetted down and enclosed in bags and that it be transported in
covered trucks to approved disposal areas so microscopic fibers
aren't spread through the air.
   The inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer;
asbestosis, a scarring of the lung; and mesothelioma, a cancer of
the chest and abdomen.
   Asbestos was used before the mid-1970s as insulation in many
buildings, and the government says more than 730,000 buildings still
contain some of the material.
   Penalties for violating asbestos-removal requirements could range
up to $25,000 per day of work for each violation. EPA officials said
more than $250,000 in civil fines may be sought in some cases.
   The suits involved renovation o demolition projects on buildings
in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas, California, Nevada and Washington.
   Among the projects cited were renovations at public schools in
Woodinville and Kent, Wash.; a high school in Kansas City, Mo.; a
junior high school in Holyrood, Kan.; and colleges in Pittsburg,
Kan., and Berea, Ohio.
   In a separate lawsuit Tuesday, the asbestos industry complained
that while there may be concerns about how asbestos is being removed
from older buildings, the EPA has failed to demonstrate that
virtually all asbestos products should be banned.
   The EPA last month announced a phase-out of most asbestos
products, such as asbestos brake pads and linings and asbestos
cement water pipes. The Asbestos Information Association said it has
asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., to overturn the
order.
   B.J. Pigg, president of the industry group, called the EPA action
``an unfounded, politically convenient attack.'' He said modern
asbestos products pose no significant health risks.
   EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the industry lawsuit raises no
arguments that have not already been considered by the EPA.

   Conservationists who fear thousands of
endangered sea turtles will drown in nets unless Gulf Coast
shrimpers are required to use turtle excluder devices are taking
their case to a federal appeals court.
   A U.S. District Court judge Tuesday denied the National Wildlife
Federation's request that shrimpers be required to use the devices,
known as TEDs.
   Wildlife Federation lawyer Robert Irvin said he would appeal the
decision by U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Harris to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   On Monday, five conservation groups filed suit against Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, alleging his actions on behalf of
shrimpers have virtually assured the drowning of thousands of
endangered sea turtles.
   The lawsuit alleges Mosbacher acted unlawfully when he suspended
regulations requiring shrimpers to use TEDs, which prevent sea
turtles from becoming ensnarled in the nets and drowning.
   Mosbacher suspended the regulations after shrimpers, angry about
having to use devices they say reduce their catch by as much as
one-third, blocked shipping channels along the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Under a court order to protect endangered sea turtles in a
separate lawsuit by the Wildlife Federation, Mosbacher then ordered
shrimpers who don't use TEDs to limit their trawling times to 105
minutes at prescribed intervals.
   Michael J. Bean, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund,
said there has been no sign that shrimpers are complying with the
limited trawl times.

   A board of examiners of the U.S. Parole
Commission is recommending that early parole be denied for Anne
Henderson-Pollard, convicted in the espionage case against her
husband, Jonathan Pollard, her lawyer says.
   The panel heard the case at the Danbury, Conn., federal
penitentiary where she's serving a five-year sentence as an
accessory after the fact, said lawyer Hamilton P. Fox.
   The panel's recommendations goes to a regional parole
commissioner for a ruling, Fox said.
   ``This is a cruel blow,'' said Morris Pollard, her father-in-law.
He said Mrs. Pollard had lost about 70 pounds during her
incarceration because of a digestive tract ailment, and weighs 86
pounds.
   Her first appeal for parole was denied last year.
   Mrs. Pollard was sentenced March 4, 1987, and is almost certain
to be granted mandatory parole under prison guidelines at the end of
March, once she has served two-thirds of her sentence.
   Her husband is serving a life sentence at the federal prison in
Marion, Ill., for selling secrets to Israel while an intelligence
analyst with the U.S. Navy.

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man charged in a bizarre plan to kidnap
a young boy and videotape his murder spent 7{ years in a Big Brother
program, officials say.
   Dean A. Lambey of Richmond ``passed all of the agency's screening
procedures to become a volunteer,'' Michael Raisig, executive
director of Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Richmond Inc., said
Tuesday.
   Lambey, 34, and Daniel T. Depew, 28, of Alexandria were charged
Monday after a six-month undercover police operation with conspiring
to videotape the abuse and murder of a child.
   Raisig said a boy matched with Lambey for 18 months was assigned
to another big brother in June.
   ``The FBI came to us when they had reason to believe he was
involved (in illegal activity),'' Raisig said. ``We immediately took
steps that there be no further contact between he and the little
brother he was assigned to.''
   Raisig said there was no evidence that the child, who was not
identified, has been molested.
   Lambey had been assigned to three boys during his 7{-year
affiliation with the organization, and Raisig said the investigation
turned up no evidence any of the boys had been molested.
   The investigation began after Lambey contacted an undercover
police officer through a computer ``bulletin board'' system and
asked about young boys for a pornographic ``snuff'' film, according
to a court document.
   ``I want to strangle the kid, I want to hang the kid, I want to
suffocate the kid,'' a court affidavit quoted Depew as saying about
his plans for the child.
   More than 100 FBI agents and San Jose, Calif., police were
involved in the investigation, U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said
Tuesday.
   ``FBI agents from Richmond and Washington followed (the suspects)
24 hours a day to make sure no child or citizen was placed in
danger,'' Hudson said.
   The investigation began in February when a California police
officer connected to a computer bulletin board system ``designed to
assist people seeking contact with others interested in diverse
sexual pursuits,'' the court papers said.
   Over the course of numerous contacts, Lambey told the undercover
officer he liked boys between the ages of 8 and 13 and that he was
interested in making a sexually explicit movie with children,
according to the affidavit filed in Richmond.
   During one telephone conversation with his police officer
contact, according to the affidavit, Lambey said, ``I think the
pleasure of doin' it would be worth it.''
   Later in the computer correspondence, Lambey described a friend,
whom he later identified as Depew, as being ``heavily into
sado-masochism'' who was interested in taking part.
   Depew, Lambey said, liked to burn young sex partners with
cigarettes, and partially strangle them.
   Lambey and Depew are charged with conspiracy to kidnap and are
being held pending grand jury action.
   Meanwhile, a search warrant executed last week at Lambey's home
turned up toys, sex aids, children's books, Mace, handcuffs, a
semi-automatic pistol and ammunition, according to papers filed in
U.S. District Court in Richmond.
   Muriatic acid, which authorities said was to be used to wash away
identifying marks of the victim, was also reportedly found in
Lambey's tool shed.
   Court papers said authorities found bondage and torture devices,
laughing gas and a white supremacy flag at Depew's home.

<HEAD>Nationwide Cutbacks in Postal Facilities</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTs ``effect'' to ``affect''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is trimming its managerial
and administrative work force by 1,000 people in a consolidation
move the agency says won't affect mail service.
   The merger of 37 management sectional centers and two field
divisions into other operations takes effect Sept. 23 and is
expected to save $30 million to $35 million a year, the service said
Tuesday.
   There will be no layoffs. Jobs will be eliminated through early
retirements and other forms of attrition, postal officials said.
Facilities that house the management centers and field divisions
will continue their mail-handling operations.
   Employees affected by the mergers will be reassigned within
commuting distance of their present jobs when possible, or they will
be relocated, the service said.
   The moves continue a reorganization that began in March 1986.
Since then, the Postal Service has established 75 field divisions,
eliminated 42 district offices and cut the number of management
sectional centers from 212 to 131. After the latest round of
consolidations, there will be 73 field divisions and 94 sectional
centers.
   Under the consolidation, the Brooklyn field division in New York
will become part of the Queens division, and the St. Paul division
will become part of the Minneapolis division.
   The management sectional centers to be eliminated are:
   Northeast Region: Binghamton and Utica, N.Y.; Red Bank and
Summit, N.J.; Portsmouth, N.H.; Burlington, Vt.; and Bangor, Maine.
   Eastern Region: Ashland, Corbin and Bowling Green, Ky.;
Charlottesville, Va.; Bluefield, W.Va.; and Zanesville, Ohio.
   Southern Region: Alexandria, La.; Huntsville, Ala., Jonesboro,
Ark.; Tupelo, Miss.; Waco, Texas; and Chattanooga, Tenn.
   Central Region: Carbondale and Champaign, Ill.; Sioux City, Iowa;
Lafayette and South Bend, Ind.; Eau Claire and Oshkosh, Wis.;
Lincoln, Neb.; Saginaw, Flint and Kalamazoo, Mich.
   Western Region: Pasadena, Redding and Marysville, Calif.;
Pocatello, Idaho; Salem, Ore.; Fairbanks, Alaska; and Flagstaff,
Ariz.

<HEAD>One Year After Persian Gulf Cease-fire, Peace Treaty Still Elusive</HEAD>

   One year after Iran and Iraq agreed to a
cease-fire in their eight-year war, they have failed to sign a peace
treaty and are rearming.
   Peace talks that began five days after the cease-fire went into
effect Aug. 20, 1988, have stalled. Representatives of the nations
have not met face to face and there has been no progress in four
rounds of negotiations through U.N. representatives.
   There have been moves to resume the talks in October, but
diplomats say there is little prospect of a breakthrough.
   The talks have reached a standstill in disputes over the
Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, the southern border between the two
countries, and Iraq's occupation of 1,000 square miles of Iranian
territory even though the U.N. cease-fire resolution specified a
return to pre-war borders.
   The Iraqis have claimed that political divisions in Tehran
blocked progress.
   The June 3 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the election
of President Hashemi Rafsanjani on July 28 raised hopes that talks
would move ahead.
   Rafsanjani was instrumental in convincing Khomeini to accept the
U.N. Security Council's cease-fire resolution following a series of
battlefield defeats.
   ``If Rafsanjani's views prevail, it could lead to some advance in
the peace process, but there's a lot of skepticism as to whether any
formal peace treaty will ever be signed,'' said Philip Robbins, an
analyst with London's Royal Institute for International Affairs.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, declared when
he was sworn in Thursday that Iran ``must try to stop the outbreak
of war'' so it can concentrate on the massive task of post-war
reconstruction.
   But he has said Iran will not make concessions in peace talks
unless Iraq withdraws from Iranian territory.
   Iraq says there can be no progress until Iran allows the
Shatt-Al-Arab, its main outlet to the Persian Gulf, to be reopened.
   Baghdad says that shortly before it invaded Iran on Sept. 22,
1980, it abrogated a 1975 agreement that drew the border down the
middle of the waterway.
   Until then, the border had run down the eastern, Iranian bank.
Tehran says the agreement is still valid.
   Because the peace talks have stalled, both nations continue to
hold an estimated 100,000 prisoners of war; only a few hundred sick
and disabled POWs have been exchanged.
   Meanwhile, Iran and Iraq are working hard to replenish their
arsenals.
   The Iraqis retain the technological edge they had during the war
and are likely to maintain it for at least five years as they
upgrade their Soviet and French weapons.
   The Iranians are replacing their increasingly deteriorating
U.S.-supplied arsenal with Soviet-designed systems, a move analysts
say will take years to complete.
   Robbins said that a key factor in whether both sides work toward
a peace settlement will be the quality of weapons Iran acquires.
   ``The Iraqis will be very nervous if the qualitative military gap
is narrowed by the Iranians, if not accompanied by a formal peace
settlement,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Iran and Iraq want advanced technology to develop their own arms
industries and lessen their dependence on other countries.
   Iran is believed to have a $20 billion military shopping list and
is looking to the Soviet bloc, China and North Korea for purchases.
   A spate of cease-fire violations, mainly by the Iranians, have
further poisoned the atmosphere.
   The Iranians have flooded a large area held by the Iraqis in the
south seeking to force them back across the border.
   That tactic has touched off several serious artillery clashes
along the truce line, where opposing forces are only yards apart in
some places.
   A U.N. force has contained these confrontations, but observers in
Baghdad have reported a recent increase in violations.
   About 1 million people were killed in the eight years of fighting
and U.N. observers do not believe either side wants a full-scale
resumption of the war. However, the observers fear skirmishes could
easily escalate.
   Iran and Iraq are rebuilding their ravaged cities and towns along
the border, repairing damaged oil installations and constructing new
factories.
   Iran desperately needs stability to revitalize its sagging
economy and carry out reconstruction.
   Political analysts believe Rafsanjani may face challenges from
Iran's radicals, many of whom opposed the cease-fire, and cannot
afford to move too quickly on any issue that could antagonize them.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, on the other hand, emerged from
the war firmly entrenched in power, his grip strengthened by the
lightning offensives of early 1988 that drove the demoralized
Iranians out of the Iraqi territory they held.

<HEAD>Police Say Vacation Photos Don't Necessarily Clear `Suspect'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Photographs of a family vacation don't necessarily
prove a suspect in the Green River slayings was on the East Coast
when the serial killings began, the case's chief investigator says.
   ``The proof that they say is conclusive and the proof police
investigators need involve two different standards,'' King County
Police Capt. Robert Evans said.
   The family of William Jay Stevens II produced photographs and
credit card receipts last week in an effort to prove Stevens was not
in Seattle when the first four victims were killed.
   The Green River killings involve the deaths of at least 40 young
women who disappeared from the Seattle and Portland, Ore., areas
from 1982 to 1984.
   Another eight missing women are believed to be victims in the
case, which takes its name from the river where the first victims
were found.
   Stevens, 38, has not been arrested or charged.
   On Tuesday, The Associated Press quoted Evans as saying the
family's records appeared to clear Stevens of suspicion in the first
four killings.
   But later, Evans said the records have neither cleared nor
intensified police interest in Stevens.
   ``For example, one photo shows this guy with his mother in front
of a building. That's all it is,'' he said.
   Evans said he had a ``personal hangup'' with the family's
description of the trip as a ``family vacation.''
   ``He was a fugitive from justice at the time. How can that be
called a vacation?'' he asked.
   Stevens, a former Gonzaga Law School student, is serving time in
the King County Jail in Seattle for a 1981 escape from a work
release program after a conviction for possessing stolen property.
   He was arrested in January in Spokane, and is scheduled for
release Sept. 25.
   Stevens was identified as a ``viable suspect'' in the affidavit
used last month to obtain a search warrant of two Spokane residences
where he lived. That search yielded 1,800 videotapes, police
uniforms and extensive credit card records.
   Among other theories, investigators have speculated that someone
posing as a police officer was responsible for the killings.

<HEAD>Parents Relent, Will Allow Transfer of Wounded Daughter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with parents' relenting and allowing daughter's transfer.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a 4-year-old girl whose brain
was damaged when her brother accidentally shot her have relented and
will move her to Delaware for recommended therapy, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Surgeons at Orlando Regional Medical Center said Evie Hagan has
regained some movement after partial paralysis but needs extensive
therapy.
   Evie's shooting by her 6-year-old brother was one of several in
Florida this summer that prompted legislators to pass a law making
it a crime for gun owners to leave loaded weapons where children can
reach them.
   Betty and David Hagan had abruptly canceled plans to send their
daughter to the Alfred duPont Institue in Wilmington, Del., saying
they don't want to be separated from her.
   ``Everybody knows that Evie is going to walk next month anyway,
and we want God to get the credit, not man,'' Hagan said Monday.
``It's trying our faith. We're not fanatical, we're just using
wisdom.''
   The Hagans, however, decided Tuesday to send the child to the
Delaware facility, said Teresa L. Heavens, institute spokeswoman.
   Earlier Tuesday, Joseph Chiaro, one of the child's three
physicians, said at a news conference that doctors were considering
asking the courts to intervene,
   ``To deny her the opportunity to maximize her potential does
raise a lot of sadness and anger in me,'' Chiaro said. ``I would
like to see everything done for her because Evie is going to live
with this decision.''
   Mrs. Hagan had said she didn't believe God would let down
hundreds of their friends and supporters, who had been assured that
``God is going to heal Evie. ... God has told them and they've told
us and encouraged us to `stick to your guns.'''
   Surgeons removed a bullet fragment from Evie's brain stem. She
emerged from a coma and remains on a respirator at the hospital.
   John Tilelli, another pediatric surgeon at ORMC, said a doctor at
the Delaware center ``felt very optimistic that with proper treating
and skill she would ultimately walk again.''

<HEAD>Report Faults State's Handling of Lincoln Papers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The curator of Illinois' Abraham Lincoln
collection rejected criticism that the documents aren't being cared
for properly, saying there's nothing amiss that a little money
wouldn't fix.
   ``If someone wants to imply that they're in danger of being
stolen, that's clearly wrong, or that ... these materials are
threatened in any way, that's also wrong,'' curator Thomas Schwartz
said Tuesday.
   The report, released Monday, said the state Historical Library
``had not properly tagged, cataloged and periodically inventoried''
significant parts of its Lincoln collection, which experts say is
second only to that of the Library of Congress.
   At issue are about 800 portraits, cartoons and prints of Lincoln,
and a 46-volume collection of the papers of Robert Todd Lincoln, the
16th president's eldest son, who served as secretary of war and
ambassador to Great Britain.
   Schwartz blamed a shortage of funds for the library's failure to
complete the project, expected to cost less than $20,000.
   Though the state frequently trumpets Lincoln's ties to Illinois
in tourism promotions, some Lincoln buffs say the state has
shortchanged efforts to preserve that heritage.
   ``There have been times at auction where I would buy Lincoln
things and hold them until the state could afford to buy them,''
said Ralph G. Newman, a Chicago manuscript dealer and Lincoln
expert. ``I didn't want to see them get away.''
   The auditor general issued a similar report in 1986 citing more
widespread neglect of Lincoln documents and artifacts, including the
gown Mary Todd Lincoln wore to her husband's second inauguration and
a silk tablecloth used on their wedding day.
   Schwartz said an inventory of the Lincolns' manuscript letters
has been completed, and that most of the other shortcomings cited in
the 1986 report have since been corrected.
   ``We've made a conscious effort to identify the most valuable
items and deal with those first,'' Schwartz said. ``We have been
making progress, but the auditor general won't remove the finding
until we have completed the entire process.''
   The inventory of the estimated 22,000 Robert Lincoln items has
proceeded slowly, in part because Schwartz is the only full-time
employee assigned to the Lincoln collection, and his work is
interrupted by research demands.
   ``If all I did was to catalog that collection without
interruption, it would probably take me a year, a year and a half,''
Schwartz said. ``But life's not that simple.''
   He acknowledged that the lack of a complete inventory means
library officials wouldn't know if items were stolen or misplaced.
For that reason, the papers are locked in a vault, and access is
strictly limited, he said.
   Only two scholars have been allowed to use the Robert Lincoln
papers, and their work was carefully supervised, he said. Similar
precautions will remain in place until the long task of cataloging
the collection is completed.
   ``When you go at it one item, one card at a time, it just takes a
long time to do it,'' Schwartz said.

<HEAD>Vandals Force Reagan Birthplace Museum to Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPICO, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ronald Reagan Birthplace Museum is
having a little law and order problem and is closing its doors until
it's solved.
   On Monday night, vandals broke a skylight during a rainstorm and
furniture donated by relatives of the former president was badly
damaged.
   ``Vandalism has been constant,'' said Paul Nicely, a 70-year-old
retired schoolteacher. He and his wife, Helen, put together the
museum in the second-floor apartment where Reagan was born on Feb.
6, 1911.
   ``We'll be closed until the problem is solved,'' he said in a
telephone interview Tuesday.
   ``The kids in town have become a real problem,'' Nicely said.
   ``We can't keep an American flag out. They keep bending the pole
or swinging on the pole. They've been breaking windows. They throw
eggs on the place. Last week they destroyed our TV disc.''
   Nicely opened the museum in 1976 in this dusty farming town in
northwestern Illinois. It was timed to coincide with the launch
there of Reagan's campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination. Reagan lost the nomination to Gerald Ford, but met with
greater success four years later.
   Some local folks figured the small town of 900 residents might
become a tourist attraction, so the usual gift shops, antique stores
and restaurants sprang up, only to wither when the boom failed to
materialize.
   But Nicely kept his privately financed museum going. He said that
over the years perhaps 60,000 visitors have come to view memorabilia
from the Reagan family, friends and relatives, and the general store
where Reagan's father worked.
   ``We've had more visitors this year than we ever had,'' Nicely
said, adding that the museum is coming off a loss of $12,000 in 1988.
   Nicely's fee schedule is a little whimsical. A lot of people pay
$1. But senior citizens, school kids and adults in groups pay 50
cents. Ministers, second-time visitors and others for various
reasons pay nothing.
   So there's not a lot of money to pay for the estimated $10,000 in
repairs necessitated by vandalism.
   ``We had 10 people from Florida when we opened up,'' Nicely said.
``You can imagine how embarrassing it was with the broken skylights
and water damage. That's when we decided to close it up until we get
this thing under control.''

<HEAD>Royal Aide in Princess' Letters Affair to Return to Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Royal aide Timothy Laurence, whose stolen letters
to Princess Anne sparked new rumors of trouble in her marriage, is
to leave Buckingham Palace to become commander of a frigate, the
defense ministry said today.
   Laurence, 35, will leave the palace next month, attend a course
for shore-based officers returning to sea and take command of the
frigate HMS Boxer Jan. 30, the ministry said in a statement.
   He has been an aide to Anne's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, the
past three years. He also holds the rank of a Royal Navy commander.
   The Sun newspaper reported April 6 that it had been given four
letters written to the 39-year-old princess by a man it did not
identify.
   The paper did not disclose the contents of the stolen letters but
said it had passed them to the police.
   On April 8, Buckingham Palace identified Laurence as the writer
in a bid to stop intense news media speculation.
   The princess has two children by her 15-year-old marriage to Mark
Phillips, 40. There have been occasional reports of problems in
their marriage.
   Anne's personal maid, Linda Joyce, in a magazine interview
published May 4, denied having stolen the letters from the princess'
briefcase. Some newspapers pointed to Miss Joyce as the main suspect
because they said she had fallen out with the princess and was
interviewed by police about the theft.
   Laurence served as an assistant navigating officer on the Royal
Yacht Britannia in 1979. He later commanded a small patrol boat
helping security force operations in Northern Ireland and then
served as principal underwater warfare officer on the frigate HMS
Alacrity.
   As an aide to the queen, he has been responsible for dealing with
her travel arrangements and introducing her guests.

<HEAD>Beneficiary of Late Congressman's Estate Says He Was Lover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who says he was the lover of U.S.
Rep. Stewart B. McKinney, who died two years ago of AIDS, said he
has decided to speak publicly about the relationship to protect his
inheritance.
   ``I'm about broke,'' Arnold R. Denson said. ``Promises were made
and they weren't kept.''
   McKinney, 56, a liberal Republican who died during his ninth term
in Congress, left a car and a 40 percent share of his Washington
house to Denson, according to documents on file in Probate Court.
   Denson's share of the estate is worth at least $59,200, but he
hasn't received it because McKinney's widow, Lucie, filed a
conflicting claim. Mrs. McKinney, who administers the estate, lived
in Connecticut while her husband spent weekdays at a house in
Washington where Denson had what her lawyer said was an attached
apartment.
   ``Stewart was my lover. We lived together for five years,''
Denson said. He displayed photographs, bills and other documents to
support his claim in an interview Monday after a probate hearing in
which the judge gave no indication of when he will rule.
   Mrs. McKinney, an heir to the Procter &amp; Gamble fortune and to an
oil and railroad fortune, testified Monday that her husband borrowed
$432,552 from her trust fund and promised to pay her back. If the
court upholds that debt, McKinney's $284,953 estate will have no
money left for Denson.
   Denson, a 34-year-old real estate agent, said he and McKinney
kept their relationship secret from the congressman's family until
he was on his death bed. At that time, he said, McKinney's family
assured him he would receive the property willed to him if he kept
silent about the relationship.
   ``I kept the press off their backs,'' Denson said. ``Honestly,
when Stewart died, I didn't know a will existed.''
   Vic Basil, former executive director of the Human Rights Campaign
Fund, the major Washington-based political action committee for
gay-lesbian issues, corroborated Denson's claim.
   ``I was never in their bedroom, but they had every appearance of
a gay couple,'' Basil said.
   After McKinney died, his doctor issued a statement saying the
congressman had contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion he received
after heart bypass surgery in 1979. That was before blood was
screened for the AIDS virus.
   Denson said he has recently tested negative for exposure to the
virus, but that two previous lovers of McKinney have died of AIDS.
   When informed of Denson's statement, Mrs. McKinney on Monday
again denied that her husband was homosexual.
   ``You caught me at a loss,'' she said. ``I guess it follows the
little blackmail letters we've been receiving.'' She refused to
elaborate.
   Her attorney, Lawrence J. Halloran of New Britain, said she was
referring to a call she received several weeks ago in which a man
claiming to be Denson told her to pay him or he would go public with
his story.
   Denson denied any contact with Mrs. McKinney since her husband's
death. Denson said he has been living in Georgia in a gay community
that he does not want to identify because he doesn't want his
neighbors harassed.

   A Soviet official visited a water bed
trade show to thank the U.S. water bed industry for supplying beds
to the victims of a June railroad disaster.
   ``We have an expression: `You can recognize your friends in
hardships,''' Yuriy Menshikov, a Soviet embassy attache stationed in
Washington, said Tuesday. ``We were deeply touched _ and not only
those injured. (It shows) mankind's compassion.''
   Menshikov presented industry representatives meeting in Nashville
with a Russian antique-style jewel box containing a scroll
commemorating the donation.
   Two industry groups donated the 50 beds, and they were flown to
Moscow's Vishnevsky Surgical Center two weeks after the June 4
accident.
   Soviet reports say 645 people died when a leaking gas pipeline
exploded and engulfed two passing trains in the Ural Mountains along
the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Many of the victims included children
bound for summer camp.
   Joe Nathanson, an industry spokesman who helped organize the
``Flight of Waterbeds,'' said manufacturers and dealers decided to
donate $25,000 worth of beds after reading a newspaper account of
the disaster.
   ``This story identified a real need at the burn center,'' he
said. ``The story just describes such agony. We know that water beds
are helpful to burn victims. The bed gives even support, so it's
more comfortable and there are no pressure points.''
   The beds, including heaters, frames and liners, were flown from
New York to Los Angeles by Pan American World Airways and picked up
by the Soviet airline Aeroflot for the trip to Moscow.

   An elderly drifter walked into police headquarters in Florence,
S.C., and shot an officer to death, then turned the gun on himself.
   In Florida, a Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy was shot to
death by a man armed with a high-powered hunting rifle after
deputies went to the man's house to commit him to an
alcohol-treatment center.
   Meanwhile in southern New Jersey, a state trooper was critically
wounded in a shooting after pulling over a car for a motor vehicle
violation on the New Jersey Turnpike.
   Florence authorities say they didn't know of any motive for
Tuesday's attack by Angelo Nicosia, a resident of Johnson City,
N.Y., who drifted in and out of town and knew many city police
officers. Florence County Sheriff William C. Barnes said Nicosia was
``about 85.''
   Nicosia walked into the police department at the City-County
Complex and asked to speak to Lt. Rick Gould, said Hugh Munn,
spokesman for the State Law Enforcement Division.
   Nicosia entered Gould's office and talked to him for about five
minutes before pulling out a handgun and shooting the officer once
in the head, Munn said. He then ran outside the station and shot
himself in the head, Munn said.
   Nicosia and Gould, an 11{-year veteran, were pronounced dead at
McLeod Regional Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Celia Whitten
said.
   Gould, 35, and other officers apparently knew Nicosia, but not in
connection with any crime, Munn said.
   Barnes said the gun used by Nicosia was purchased Tuesday morning
in Florence, a city of 32,000 about 80 miles east of Columbia. South
Carolina does not require a waiting period to purchase a weapon,
Munn said.
   In Florida, Deputy James Dickinson, 29, was killed Tuesday
evening at a home near Royal Palm Beach, about 10 miles west of West
Palm Beach.
   As Dickinson approached the house, David Boswell, 42, popped out
from behind the front door and shot the deputy once in the head,
Palm Beach County Sheriff Richard Wille said.
   Boswell, a land surveyor, was charged with first-degree murder
and held overnight in the county jail pending a court hearing this
afternoon in West Palm Beach.
   His estranged wife, Beverly Boswell, had asked for an emergency
court order earlier Tuesday to commit him to an alcohol abuse
clinic. The two had been arguing at the house and Boswell had
pointed a gun at his wife, sheriff's spokesman Bob Ferrell said.
   In New Jersey, Anthony V. DiSalvatore was in critical but stable
condition early today after surgery at the Cooper Medical Center in
Camden, a hospital operator said. Authorities said he was shot in
the abdomen and the chest.
   Three Maryland men suspected of heading a cocaine ring were
arrested in connection with the shooting and were to be arraigned
today in Superior Court in Gloucester County. One man had fled the
scene on foot and the others were arrested after fleeing in the
trooper's cruiser and later commandeering a pickup truck.

<HEAD>Sight Reading Requirement Discriminated, U.S. Education Department
Ruled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A music school's requirement that graduates
sight-read music discriminated against the blind, the U.S.
Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights ruled.
   The Berklee College of Music, one of the largest independent
music schools in the nation, has for years required its students to
show they can sight-read sheet music as part of the core curriculum.
   The school warned blind applicants that they could never fulfill
core requirements and therefore would not graduate. Most were
discouraged and did not apply, The Boston Globe reported today.
   Thomas J. Burns, regional director of the New England division of
the Office of Civil Rights, said qualified blind students should not
be held back based on their inability to perform a single test.
   ``I think it's a very important right that's been clarified,'' he
said. ``The case was unique and certainly the first we've come
across.''
   Berklee changed its curriculum and graduation requirements before
the ruling to ``de-emphasize sight reading,'' said Lawrence Bethune,
dean of the 2,900 students at the school.
   ``This is certainly noteworthy,'' said Kenneth Jernigan,
executive director of the National Federation of the Blind. ``This
case recognizes that we are really dealing with a civil rights
matter, and that's a refreshing change.''
   The case began two years ago when a visually impaired woman
decided to apply to Berklee and was told she would not graduate. Her
mother filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights. The office
ruled against the school last month.
   A curriculum committee at Berklee had been looking at the core
requirements and decided to change the sight reading requirement
irrespective of the discrimination case, Bethune said.
   ``The problem we had was that at the time, we felt the standard
could not be modified,'' he said. ``But we have no bone to pick with
blind students. We accept them, and we're happy to have them.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party strongly condemned a
secret Soviet-German agreement that divided Poland at the start of
World War II.
   In a statement released Tuesday, the eve of the 50th anniversary
of the agreement, the party's Politburo said the pact ``flagrantly
violated'' international law.
   The secret protocol to the pact defined spheres of influence and
allowed for the occupation of eastern Poland by the Soviet Union and
western Poland by Nazi German troops.
   Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga, responding to questions at a news
conference, said the statement did not mean that Poland would seek
to regain territory in present day Byelorussia, Lithuania and the
Ukraine that remained in Soviet hands after World War II.
   He also said there were no plans to seek any war damages from the
Soviets.
   The Soviet Union had long denied the existence of the secret
protocol, agreed to on Aug. 23, 1939, by Soviet Foreign Minister
Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von
Ribbentrop.
   The agreement also led to the Soviet annexation of Lithuania and
the Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia.
   Eight days after the pact was signed, Germany declared war on
Poland to start World War II. On Sept. 17, 1939, Soviet troops
occupied Poland from the East, claiming that the Polish government
had collapsed and that they were coming to protect Byelorussian and
Ukrainian nationalities in Poland.
   The Politburo branded the secret protocol and a subsequent Sept.
28, 1939, German-Soviet agreement that adjusted their border through
occupied Poland as ``non-existent and invalid'' from the very
beginning.
   ``This leaves no doubt about the political, legal and moral
assessment of those treaties,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Wladyslaw
Klaczynski later told the state PAP news agency.
   However, the Politburo said its statement was intended to have no
bearing on ``the borders decided (after the war) and existing in
Europe.''
   After the war, Poland lost about 71,300 square miles of its
pre-war eastern territories to the Soviet Union. It was compensated
with a smaller amount of German territory in the west.

<HEAD>Sketches of Some Black Panthers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Newton Killed, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiery rhetoric, leftist ideology, an arsenal of guns and the
threat of violence brought the young members of the Black Panther
Party international prominence from the group's founding in 1966
through the early 1970s.
   Huey P. Newton, an eloquent speaker, co-founded the Panthers with
Bobby Seale in the offices of the old North Oakland Neighborhood
Poverty Program and served as its defense minister and chief
ideologue.
   At their peak, the Panthers were a national organization that ran
food programs and schools for ghetto youths, taught defense against
violent attacks by drug dealers and police and served as a
counterpoint to the pacifistic side of the civil rights movement.
   Newton's numerous arrests and legal battles kept him in the news
until his death Tuesday. Other Panthers died young or went to jail,
and some went on to careers with lower profiles.
   Here are some of the figures who made the Black Panthers a voice
of hope for some, a cry of anguish for others and a source of fear
for many:
   _Bobby Seale, 52, served as Panther chairman and is now a
graduate student in political science at Temple University and works
as a community liaison in Philadelphia. Among the most enduring
images of the 1960s is that of Seale bound and gagged in the Chicago
courtroom where he was charged with conspiracy to incite violence at
the 1968 Democratic National Convention. His conviction for contempt
of court was later overturned. He also was acquitted of killing
another Panther. He returned to Oakland in 1973 and came close to
being elected mayor. Later he was purged from the party by Newton.
   _Eldridge Cleaver, 53, who was Panther information minister and
author of ``Soul on Ice,'' one of the seminal works of the Black
Power movement. Cleaver, who ran for president in 1968 on the Peace
and Freedom Party ticket, later fled the country following a
shootout between Panthers and the police. He split with Newton in
the early 1970s and was purged from the party. He spent time in
China, Algeria and North Vietnam, and later said his experience with
communist governments contributed to a profound political
conversion. Returning to the United States, Cleaver became a
born-again Christian and Republican. He unsuccessfully sought the
GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate in California in 1986. Cleaver
was placed on probation last year after separate convictions for
burglary and cocaine possession. He recently told Ebony magazine
that he lectures to conservative groups and makes and sells ceramic
objects.
   _Bobby Rush, 42, Panther deputy defense minister and head of the
group's Chicago chapter, Rush left the Panthers after a 1969 police
raid on a Chicago apartment in which Fred Hampton, 20, and Mark
Clark, 21, were shot to death. After being jailed in 1971 on a
weapons conviction, Rush said he realized that political power would
come only through the electoral system. He was elected to the
Chicago City Council in 1982 and continues to serve as an alderman.
A father of five, Rush also runs his own financial consulting firm.
   _Elaine Brown, Panther chairwoman from 1974 to 1977, when Newton
was in Cuba. Under Brown, the Panthers concentrated on community
projects in Oakland, Calif., including school breakfast programs,
health clinics and legal aid to the poor. She ran unsuccessfully for
Oakland City Council in 1973 and 1975 and served as a delegate for
former California Gov. Jerry Brown at the Democratic National
Convention in 1976. She now works for a Los Angeles attorney.
   _Raymond ``Masai'' Hewitt, the Panther's education minister from
1969 to 1971. Hewitt died of a heart attack in Los Angeles last year
at age 46; at the time, he was doing research on South Africa for
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   _Elmo ``Geronimo'' Pratt, 41, who headed the Panther's Los
Angeles chapter. In 1972, he was convicted of murdering a Southern
California woman during a $30 robbery. He has maintained he was at
Black Panther headquarters in Oakland at the time. Pratt is serving
a life sentence at San Quentin Prison.
   _Johnny Spain, 40, joined the Panthers while at San Quentin
serving time for a 1966 robbery-murder. He taught a course on the
criminal justice system at Stanford University last year and hopes
to teach a similar course at the University of California at
Berkeley next term. He also has been working as an electrician. A
federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that Spain is entitled to a new
trial in the 1971 killings of two prison guards, saying his trial
defense was hampered by the heavy shackles he was forced to wear in
the jury's view.

<TEXT>
   Citing a boost in public support after coming
under fire by Republicans in the 1988 presidential campaign, the
American Civil Liberties Union says it is organizing new chapters in
Illinois.
   ``Overall, ACLU membership in Illinois has increased by nearly 15
percent,'' said K.T. Sullivan, membership director for the group's
Illinois division. ``By mid-year, we had already met our 1989 goal
and recruited 1,200 new `card-carrying' members throughout the
state.''
   During the 1988 presidential campaign, then-candidate George Bush
faulted the ACLU for what he said were far-left stands and
relentlessly attacked his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, for being a member.
   ``The attacks on the organization during the presidential
campaign ... and recent anti-civil liberties decisions by the U.S.
Supreme Court have combined to arouse public support,'' Ms. Sullivan
said Tuesday.
   The group's Illinois membership, which totals about 14,000 and is
concentrated in the Chicago area, was also boosted by interest in
the fight to keep abortion legal, she said.
   Nationwide membership, estimated at about 275,000, has also
increased this year, Ms. Sullivan said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Newton Fought Racism From Early Age</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Huey P. Newton, the gun-toting,
rhetoric-spewing revolutionary who co-founded the Black Panther
Party, fought white authority from an early age, refusing to submit
to racism in school or in the streets.
   The son of a Baptist minister, Newton never could abide by his
parents' admonition ``to learn to take a little more'' from whites
rather than fight back.
   Instead, Newton turned to militant poses and angry words, calling
the police ``pigs'' and taking up arms with the Panthers. The group,
which for a time did grassroots political organizing and fed
breakfast to poor children in black ghettos, was about much more
than guns. But guns were always part of their image and Newton's
life.
   On a shabby street in a poor neighborhood where drug deals and
gun battles are common, a gun was the instrument of Newton's death
early Tuesday.
   To Tom Orloff, a prosecutor whose efforts to convict Newton of
the slaying of a 16-year-old prostitute were twice stymied by
deadlocked juries, Newton was a gangster. ``I didn't see anything
political about him at all,'' Orloff said.
   To his friend and lawyer Fred Hiestand, Newton by the time he
died was a scarred survivor with a powerful intellect who ``didn't
seem to be able to find a role for himself.''
   Newton went through five murder trials and several other legal
battles. In 1980, he earned a doctor of philosophy degree from the
University of California at Santa Cruz. His dissertation was titled:
``War Against the Panthers, A Study of Repression in America.''
   Born in Monroe, La., on Feb. 17, 1942, Huey Percy Newton was the
youngest of seven children. His father, a minister in New Orleans,
moved the family to California a year later and took a job with the
Oakland Streets Department.
   Newton said in a 1968 interview that he became aware as a public
school pupil of white teacher prejudices.
   ``To compensate for this lack of ability we saw in ourselves, we
would say that whites were smarter but we were stronger,'' he said.
``We didn't understand that the white boys had gotten a head start
from their families because many of them were middle class, and
through the experience of hearing their families exchange ideas over
the dinner table they learned to cope with ideas.''
   Newton said he avoided his home as much as possible, and spent
time at school courting trouble by challenging the school
administration. He said he was suspended 20 to 30 times, and that
such challenges by black students led to confrontations with the
police who ``were very brutal to us even at that age.''
   Newton attended Merritt College, on the edge of an Oakland black
ghetto. He was exposed to ideas of black nationalism, but also to
the streets. He was arrested for theft and burglary, and in 1964,
sentenced to a year in jail for assault with a deadly weapon.
   After his release, he and a friend from Merritt, Bobby Seale,
talked of the need for blacks to have a revolutionary political
party that would deal mainly with the problems of ghetto youths.
   The only logical response to police brutality, they thought, was
an armed Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. The name was taken
from the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama, which
adopted the black panther as a symbol.
   The Panthers armed themselves with shotguns, law books and tape
recorders, and monitored police as they patrolled the ghetto.
   In 1967, Newton was arrested on charges of killing a police
officer _ only a few blocks from the scene of his own death. He
later was convicted of manslaughter, but released in 1970 when the
verdict was overturned because of errors by the trial judge.
   In 1974, he was charged with the prostitute slaying and the
pistol-whipping of a tailor who angered him by calling him ``baby.''
Newton went into self-exile in Cuba, where he worked in a cement
factory, until returning to the United States in 1977.
   Newton is survived by his wife, Fredrika Slaughter-Newton, a son,
two daughters, three brothers and three sisters.

<HEAD>Captive Breeding Saves Arabian Oryx, Black-Footed Ferret, Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Tahitian tree snails to Arabian antelopes,
international wildlife conservationists say they are succeeding in
saving some of the world's endangered species.
   About 200 specialists of the World Conservation Union's Species
Survival Commission met in Rome this week to discuss ways of
protecting animals threatened by poaching, destruction of habitat
and encroachment by man.
   The union, based in Gland, Switzerland, groups governments,
government agencies and non-governmental organizations such as the
Sierra Club.
   The three-day Rome meeting, which ended Tuesday, examined the
well-known plight of the African elephant, whose numbers have
dropped from 1.3 million to 700,000 in the past 10 years because of
poaching.
   But the experts also discussed the prospects for saving
lesser-known species such as the Mediterranean monk seal, Himalayan
snow leopard, Florida panther, Javan rhinoceros and Liberian
mongoose.
   In many cases, the answer is breeding animals in captivity and
releasing them in the wild.
   ``It's only in the past few years that captive breeding has
become an integral part of conservation,'' said Ulysses S. Seal, a
professor at the University of Minnesota who is chairman of the
union's captive breeding group. ``We project that 1,500 animals,
birds and reptiles will need captive breeding in the next 50 years.
Right now, we have more than 125 species on our plate.''
   Those include the Arabian oryx, a large antelope that became
extinct in the wild but was saved by breeding in zoos in London,
Phoenix and elsewhere. Wild herds now roam Oman, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
   ``This is the flagship example of a dramatic species saved from
extinction by captive breeding,'' Seal said in an interview.
   Another success story involves the black-footed ferret, a member
of the Wyoming weasel family. Only 17 were left in the wild in 1985,
but captive breeding has brought the population up to 124.
   ``We predict that in two years the population will expand to more
than 500, and in 1991 we plan to start releasing them back into the
wild,'' Seal said.
   He also cited efforts to save the partula, a species of tiny tree
snails found on the Tahitian island of Moorea. The species was
virtually wiped out by carniverous snails imported from Florida, but
the surviving partula have been taken to a dozen zoos in four
countries for breeding, Seal said.
   The next target is the Javan rhino. The lumbering beasts once
roamed across much of Indochina but today only 50 are left on the
island of Java. Seal said the union is working with the Indonesian
government to begin a captive breeding program next year.
   Captive breeding is not the answer for all animals, however,
especially members of the cat species.
   ``There is some captive breeding, but there are a lot of problems
in reintroducing a large predator that is captive bred,'' said Peter
Jackson, chairman of the conservation union's cat specialist group.
``For one thing, people are afraid of them. Also, a cat has to learn
how to hunt from its parents, it doesn't come naturally.''
   Nevertheless, conservationists have succeeded in saving the the
lynx, which was extinct in western Europe at the turn of the
century. More than a dozen were caught in the wild in Czechoslovakia
and released in the Swiss and French Alps in the early 1970s. Sixty
to 80 lynx survive in the wild today, Jackson said.
   Conservation has taken a unique twist in India, where man-eating
tigers have killed more than 500 people in the Sunderbans mangove
forests of West Bengal since 1975.
   It seems that tigers only attack their prey from behind. So three
years ago, wildlife officials began issuing rubber face masks for
Sunderbans workers to wear on the backs of their heads.
   Since then, no one wearing a mask has been attacked, Jackson said.
   ``Some were attacked after they had just taken off the mask for
lunch,'' he said. ``Tigers have been seen following those wearing
the masks but they have not pressed home the attack.''
   For all the attention devoted to tigers, elephants, rhinos and
others animals, it is some of the world's smaller species that are
most at risk, specialists said.
   ``People focus on the larger species that they are going to
miss,'' said George Rabb, president of the Chicago Zoological Park
and chairman of the species survival commission. ``But for every one
of these, at least 5,000 species disappear every year, mainly small
insects living in rain forests.''
   ``You could almost bet that the most endangered species in the
world is not known to science,'' added Martin Holdgate, director
general of the union. ``It is living somewhere in the canopy of a
rain forest. One of these unknown, inconspicuous insects. No
scientist will miss it, except as a statistic.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diana Vreeland, a flamboyant trendsetter on both
sides of the Atlantic, lived with drama and imagination at the place
where fashion, art and publishing meet.
   Vreeland was in her 80s when she died of a heart attack Tuesday.
   ``The only real elegance is in the mind,'' Vreeland once said.
``If you've got that, the rest really follows from it.''
   Her originality helped launch the careers of designer Oscar de la
Renta and model Lauren Hutton, among other people and trends.
   ``She was and remains the only genius fashion editor,''
photographer Richard Avedon said.
   Vreeland was fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine from
1939-62. She joined Vogue in 1962 and presided over the fashion
world there as editor in chief until 1971.
   In the turbulent 60s, the industry watched her every move and
repeated her legendary witticisms, such as, ``The bikini is the most
important thing since the atom bomb.''
   After running a lingerie shop in London for a few years, Vreeland
moved to New York in 1936 and began writing her ``Why Don't You...''
column for Harper's Bazaar, in which she posed questions to
Depression-era America such as, ``Why don't you put all your dogs in
bright yellow collars and leads like all the dogs in Paris?''
   The thin Parisian native blazed a theatrical trail through the
fashion world for over four decades. Described as ``an elegant crane
picking her way out of a swamp'' by English designer Sir Cecil
Beaton, Vreeland was known for her lacquered black hair, rouged
cheeks and ear lobes, and red lips and nails.
   Vreeland discovered Hutton in 1966, when other fashion
impresarios considered the gap-toothed beauty too unusual-looking to
be a model.
   ``Mrs. Vreeland was a genius for understanding ... that society
expressed itself visually, whether it was through fashion, whether
it was through photography, whether it was through the way that
people lived,'' said John Ross, a spokesman at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. ``She always understood the cutting edge and she was
usually a little ahead of it.''
   In 1972, Vreeland became special consultant to the Costume
Institute of the Metropolitan, where she was noted for revolutionary
exhibitions like a retrospective of the work of Spanish designer
Balenciaga, and a survey called, ``The 10's, the 20's, the 30's,''
an exploration of a group of leading Paris designers.
   In 1977, she received the French Order of Merit and in 1976, the
French Legion of Honour.
   Vreeland moved with her parents to America at the outbreak of
World War I, according to McDowell's Directory of Twentieth Century
Fashion, which dubbed her ``the undisputed Muse of Fashion.''
   Born Diana Dalziel, she married Thomas Reed Vreeland in 1924. A
banker and Yale graduate, Vreeland died in 1966. They had two
children, Thomas Reed Vreeland, now an architect, and Frederick D.
Vreeland, a diplomat.
   ``She spent her last day thanking her staff and friends and
family,'' said her grandson, Alexander Vreeland. ``She never said
why, she just said thank you and goodbye.''
   Some fashion texts said Vreeland was born in 1906, but her
grandson said that because she had two birth certificates, her true
age was not known.
   Vreeland also is survived by a sister, four grandchildren and
four great-grandchildren.

   A top Chinese swimmer announced today he is
seeking political asylum in this British colony because of his
activity in support of the crushed pro-democracy movement in China.
   Yang Yang, 20, said he feared he would be arrested if he returned
home.
   Yang told reporters that after arriving in Hong Kong on a tourist
visa in March he participated in local marches supporting Beijing
students demonstrating for more freedom.
   He also said he helped pro-democracy activists and claimed to be
a member of the New York-based Chinese Alliance for Democracy, which
has been sharply criticized by Beijing authorities.
   The Communist Chinese government crushed the movement for
democracy in June and subsequently arrested thousands of people in a
crackdown on dissent.
   The swimmer said he asked the Hong Kong Immigration Department
earlier this month for asylum but had not received a response. He
said his tourist visa has expired.
   An Immigration Department spokesman refused comment on Yang.
   Yang, a Beijing native, was the second best male swimmer in China
last year and has represented his country at competitions in Hong
Kong and Yugoslavia, according to biographical information provided
at his news conference.

   Swedish Volvos would be produced in
South Korea under a contract being negotiated with Ssangyong Motor
Co., company officials said today.
   Under an agreement expected to be signed in September, Volvo
would initially supply the main components and parts for the
assembly of medium and large-size cars beginning in 1991, Ssangyong
said. Cars would be sold in the domestic market, it said.
   Ssangyong produces specially equipped vehicles, buses and jeeps
but has not entered the local car market. This would be the first
European brand car to be made and sold domestically.
   The Ministry of Trade and Industry confirmed today that Ssangyong
has filed papers outlining the venture. Further details were not

   For nine children in a squalid apartment in a
poverty-ravaged section of the Bronx, authorities said, home meant
their own private hell where they were raped, sodomized or beaten.
   Herman McMillan, 42, who was arrested at the apartment along with
his 34-year-old wife, Frances, said he had buried two infants less
than half a mile away and made vague references to a third missing
child, police said. Police began digging Tuesday, and planned to
continue today.
   Police said they believed the missing children were born in the
apartment and did not survive more than a month. ``We have no reason
at this point to believe they were killed by the parents,'' Deputy
Chief Joseph DeMartino said.
   McMillan was charged with rape, sodomy, incest, sexual abuse,
assault, reckless endangerment and endangering a minor. Mrs.
McMillan was charged with assault and endangerment.
   The six boys and three girls rarely emerged from the filthy
three-room apartment, where beatings were administered with fists or
sticks and the children sometimes had their heads held underwater,
police and neighbors said Tuesday.
   ``There were 11 people living in a darkened apartment with little
access to the outside world,'' said DeMartino. ``They only knew this
way of life. ... They were recluses. The husband would come and go
occasionally. The wife remained in the apartment. The children
remained in the apartment. They did little or nothing.''
   ``The oldest children suffered most from the sexual abuse and the
younger children from physical abuse,'' he said. Apparently, only
the oldest girl had ever been to school, he said.
   Police and city welfare officials went to the apartment on May 25
after neighbors complained that the children, ages 4 months to 16
years old, were being neglected. The arrests Monday followed three
months of delicate questioning of the children, authorities said.
   Neighbors said McMillan never spoke and ignored greetings as he
came and went.
   Freddie Santana, who lives next door, said that if any of the
children looked out the kitchen window, the man in the apartment
``would grab them back and used to hit the kids and beat them.''
   McMillan, originally from North Carolina, did occasional work as
a laborer and received $554 a month from Social Security, DeMartino
said. Mrs. McMillan came from Connecticut.
   The apartment where they lived for 3{ years was dark and filthy,
strewn with dirty clothes and newspapers. ``No electricity ...
windows covered with dirty rags and sheets and the children appeared
frightened and dirty,'' DeMartino said.
   DeMartino said that although the apartment building was a known
drug location, there was no evidence of narcotics in the home.
   As the McMillans were led from the police station Tuesday,
reporters asked if they beat their children. ``No,'' they each
answered.

<HEAD>American University to Stay in Beirut Despite the Situation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American University of Beirut will never
leave the Lebanese capital despite fighting that has closed it for
more than five months, the school's chief administrator said.
   ``It will not exist anywhere else,'' Dr. Ibrahim Salti said
Tuesday.
   The school's president, Frederick P. Herter, is based in New York
because Lebanon remains off limits to Americans, and Salti now
handles administration in Beirut.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, the Jordanian
physician said ``it would take decades'' to reproduce the programs
AUB offers on its 73-acre seaside campus.
   He said that in the 123 years since it was founded by
Presbyterian missionaries, American University has developed a
``close symbiotic relationship'' with Beirut that makes the city and
campus inseparable.
   The school, which has educated many of the Arab world's most
prominent figures, was forced to suspend classes in March when heavy
shelling erupted between Syrians in west Beirut and the largely
Christian army of Gen. Michel Aoun in east Beirut.
   Since then, 70 shells have hit the campus, located in west
Beirut, Salti said.
   He said most of the damage was ``superficial,'' however, and that
none of the staff or 5,300 students had been killed, largely because
classes had been suspended.
   He said the university's 421-bed hospital and medical school have
continued to operate, although a shortage of nurses has cut
operations by a third. The American University Hospital is by far
Lebanon's largest and most sophisticated medical center.
   Before the nation's civil war began in 1975, the hospital was the
most popular in the Middle East, with people arriving from all over
the region for treatment.
   Salti said the school had become used to battles and cease-fires
during the past 14 years but that the current round of fighting _
which began in March _ was ``probably the most cruel, the most
protracted'' of the war.
   Scores of Westerners have been kidnapped or assassinated in
Beirut in recent years.
   There currently are 16 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon; eight
are Americans.
   Three of the hostages were employed by American University:
Thomas Sutherland, 58, Scottish-born acting dean of agriculture, was
kidnapped June 9, 1985. American Joseph Cicippio, 58, acting
comptroller has been held since Sept. 12, 1986; Brian Keenan, 32, of
British-ruled Northern Ireland, an English language teacher, has
been held since April 11, 1986.
   Longest held is Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Salti said if the university can meet its Sept. 11 target date
for reopening classes, or even one in October, it should be able to
make up for the lost time by holding classes through scheduled
vacation breaks.
   ``If a cease-fire is declared tommorrow, in a few days the campus
will be a beehive of activity again,'' he said.
   Salti said the war has driven away nearly all of the foreign
staff, who once made up 30 percent of the faculty, and has reduced
non-Lebanese students to about 10 percent of enrollment.
   But he said interest from non-Lebanese students remains strong,
partly because of the school's standards, location and low cost.
   And despite, all the problems facing American University, its
pre-med students recently scored above the U.S. average on the
standard American test used to rate qualifications for medical
school, Salti said.

<HEAD>Medical Examiner Says Boy Died of Seizurelike Episode at Theme Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy who collapsed last month during
a roller-coaster ride at Six Flags Over Georgia died from a
``seizurelike disorder,'' a medical examiner concluded.
   After a month-long investigation, Cobb County Associate Medical
Examiner Wayne Ross said Tuesday that the two-minute ride apparently
aggravated a previously undiagnosed condition in William ``Brett''
Pope, of Talladega, Ala.
   ``Somehow, I feel that the ride, through the acceleration or the
G-forces, lowered his seizure threshold,'' Ross said.
   He said the results do not mean the ride is dangerous for people
in good health.
   Ross said his office learned about two incidents involving Brett
that might constitute a pattern of similar episodes. One was a
near-drowning last year.
   Ronald Pope, Brett's father, on Tuesday said he accepted the
medical examiner's conclusions but rejected assertions that the past
incidents are connected to his son's death.
   ``When he got on that ride, he was a healthy boy,'' Pope said.

<HEAD>Earthquakes Kill Two in Ethiopia, Injure Eight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earthquakes this week spawned
landslides that killed two people and hundreds of livestock,
destroyed a half-dozen bridges and left a major highway impassable,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
   Eight people also were injured in the four temblors that hit
northeastern Ethiopia Sunday through Tuesday. The quakes registered
as high as 6.5 on the Richter scale, the agency reported Tuesday.
   The fatalities occurred when landslides overturned four trucks
and badly damaged a 19-mile stretch of highway leading to the Red
Sea port of Assab, the agency said.
   The port handles 70 percent of Ethiopia's trade as well as much
of the relief food needed by refugees and drought victims in this
impoverished East African nation. Ethiopia's only oil refinery also
is at the port.
   The agency said six bridges also were destroyed in the earthquake.
   Assab officials said the landslides killed 250 camels and goats
and covered many of the water wells in the arid region.
   Much of the region's semi-nomadic population had fled the area
seeking shelter and food from nearby villages, the news agency said.
   The earthquakes' epicenter was described as 320 miles northeast
of the capital, Addis Ababa, between the towns of Dubti and Serdo.
Earthquakes of similar severity hit the same region in 1961 causing
several buildings to collapse.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is
10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6.5 can cause severe damage.

   Huey P. Newton, the charismatic co-founder
of the Black Panther Party, was adrift without a battle to fight in
his final days, a close friend said.
   Newton's bullet-riddled body was found before dawn Tuesday in a
neighborhood known for drug violence. Police had no suspects and no
motive for the slaying, said Lt. Mike Sims.
   Newton, 47, was killed in the neighborhood where he began
organizing blacks more than 20 years ago, several miles from his
present home. About 200 mourners marched Tuesday night at the scene
of the shooting, some chanting, cheering, carrying candles and
holding their fists in the black power salute.
   ``There are those who are going to try and make him look like
gangster but we know he was a brother. We know he was a fighter,''
said the Rev. Cecil Williams of San Francisco, one of the
participants.
   Fred Hiestand, a Sacramento lawyer who was Newton's attorney and
close friend, said Newton was struggling to find a niche for himself
after earning a doctorate, overcoming alcohol and drug abuse
problems and facing life with no criminal charges for the first time
in 15 years.
   ``He was just trying to figure out where he fit, what he was
going to do ... trying to shake some alcohol and chemical dependency
that he acquired, but he was doing it all on his own, without
anyone's help,'' said Hiestand.
   Hiestand said he saw Newton on Friday and the former Panther
leader ``seemed to be OK. There was nothing bothering him that he
talked about.'' Hiestand said he believed Newton had been drug-free
for at least six months.
   Newton was arrested earlier this year for possession of drug
paraphernalia, but police said they had no indication the slaying
was drug-related.
   ``He didn't seem to be able to find a role for himself,'' said
Hiestand. ``I think he was like a lot of people who went through
that period ... He lived it intensely and it left its scars.''
   With Bobby Seale, Newton founded the Black Panther Party. Armed
Panther members followed police cars to monitor their activities in
the black community.
   Under the slogan ``All power to the people,'' the Panthers also
operated a school, a health clinic and programs for ghetto
youngsters.
   The party drifted into violence and gradually disintegrated, as
members were killed and the FBI infiltrated and disrupted the
organization.
   Tuesday's shooting occurred in a neighborhood of run-down
Victorian-style homes and abandoned buildings.
   ``To us, Huey Newton was a hero,'' said resident Fred DePalm.
``The Black Panthers were a thing to identify with along with
Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.''
   Over the years, however, Newton was accused of two slayings and
stood trial five times. His conviction in the 1967 killing of an
Oakland police officer was overturned and two trials in the 1974
death of a young prostitute resulted in deadlocked juries.
   Newton went into self-exile in Cuba shortly thereafter, returning
to the United States in 1977.
   This year he served a 90-day sentence in San Quentin Prison for a
parole violation and a concurrent term for his plea of no contest to
misappropriating $15,000 in public funds earmarked for a community
school the party ran.
   ``He was a person who contributed an awful lot to the
consciousness of this country in the early years of his
participation in the Black Panther Party,'' said former Panther
Johnny Spain. ``In the last few years of his life, unfortunately he
wasn't able to contribute.''
   Charles Garry, who was Newton's lawyer for many years, said he
never saw a violent side to Newton.
   ``I saw a very sweet side, a humane side, a dignified side, a man
who was theoretically in favor of a better world.'' But Garry said
Newton became paranoid and his personality changed years ago when he
was targeted by the FBI.
   ``They destroyed him over 10 years ago,'' Garry said. ``To me,
Huey died 10 years ago.''
   Newton earned a doctorate in philosophy at age 38 from the
University of California at Santa Cruz, where he wrote a
dissertation titled: ``War Against the Panthers, a Study of
Repression in America.''
   Law enforcement authorities had a different view.
   Tom Orloff, who prosecuted Newton in an assault case, called him
``a man who lived by violence and outside the law.'' Orloff said,
``When I dealt with him in the late '70s for the crimes he committed
in 1974, he certainly was nothing but a gangster.''
   As Newton was recalled alternately as a hero and a scoundrel,
Hiestand said there was hidden significance to the contrary
descriptions.
   ``I tell you, Huey said that contradiction was the ruling
philosophy of the universe,'' he said.

<HEAD>East German Escape Wave Swells, More Than 2,000 in Four Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 East Germans have
escaped to the West through Hungary the past four days and sought
refuge in West Germany, a Foreign ministry source said today.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that so far
this month about 3,300 East Germans had illegally escaped from their
country. The refugees have overwhelmed West Germany's embassies
abroad and threatened its relations with communist East Berlin.
   The source said 2,000 East Germans who had escaped between
Saturday and Tuesday had applied to the West German Embassy in
Vienna for travel documents.
   He said Bonn's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, was sheltering
nearly 140 East Germans. The Foreign Ministry said that mission was
closed this morning because its ability to house or help the
refugees was ``totally exhausted.'' A handful of the East Germans
could be seen through the fence of the embassy's large garden,
sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes early today. Czechoslovaks
seeking visas lined up outside.
   Bonn has also temporarily shut down its missions in East Berlin,
where 116 East Germans are holed up, and in Budapest, Hungary, where
171 had sought refuge. There also was one East German at the West
German embassy in Warsaw, Poland.
   The East German government of Erich Honecker has accused West
Germany of instigating the escapes and warned that relations between
the two Germanies will suffer if Bonn continues to harbor the
refugees.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday that he was willing to meet
with Honecker to try to resolve the issue. But he also said the
escapes would not stop unless East Berlin gives in to demands from
its public for social reforms.
   While Poland and Hungary have loosened the Communist Party's grip
on power, Honecker has held fast to policies that severely restrict
travel and free expression.
   Many refugees have said they fled across Hungary's border with
Austria because they had lost hope for change.
   Although the closure of the Budapest embassy had locked out
hundreds of East German arrivals, West German envoys have been
quietly issuing passports outside the mission grounds.
   That has allowed East Germans willing to sneak across the
Hungarian border at night to go directly to West Germany instead of
having to seek travel documents from Bonn's embassy in Vienna.
   Foreign Ministry officials said last week that more than 1,000
passports had been issueed to East Germans in Budapest after the
embassy closed.
   Spokesman Peter Rothen said today that the ministry would not
disclose the latest total because of the sensitivity surrounding the
refugee issue.
   Tensions between East Germany and West Germany have been
exacerbated by the shooting death late Monday of an East German
trying to flee across the Hungary-Austria border with his wife and
child.
   Hungary's MTI news agency said the man, Kurt-Werner Schulz,
struggled with a Hungarian border guard who tried to stop his flight
and was fatally wounded when he guard's handgun accidentally fired.
   The West German Foreign Ministry has demanded an explanation and
assurances from Budapest that armed force will not be used against
East German escapees.
   Bonn's Ministry for Inter-German Affairs reported earlier this
week that more than 65,000 East Germans have arrived here so far
this year in the largest migration since the Berlin Wall was erected
in 1961. At that time, East Germans were fleeing at a rate of 2,000
per day.
   West Germany expects more than 100,000 East Germans by the end of
the year.

on the pace of his golf game.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House physician Lawrence Mohr
says it's almost as if President Bush has invented a new sport:
``aerobic golf.''
   Mohr, whose job it is to stay within hailing distance of the
president, shook his head in disbelief the other day as he raced,
black doctor's satchel in hand, to keep up with the president and
his party as they dashed from green to green.
   Bush has been spending much of his vacation at the Cape Arundel
Golf Club, where the other day he and his party zipped through 18
holes of golf in one hour and 52 minutes _ something of a local
record.
   Asked this morning about his golf game and why he plays so fast,
Bush acknowledged he doesn't like to waste time on the links. He
told reporters he likes to get finished so he has time to ``do other
things.''
   ``All right, the crowd is hushed. They sense Mr. Smooth is
back,'' Bush said to no one in particular as he teed off one recent
day.
   It's not clear why the president keeps referring to himself as
``Mr. Smooth,'' especially since his golf game remains, he admits, a
little ragged. But that's what he calls himself _ and he is, after
all, the president.
   ``Excuse me, Mr. Smooth,'' his principal golfing partner, eldest
son George W. Bush, called out recently.
   The president told him to keep quiet, that Mr. Smooth did not
like a lot of talking.
   The son and father appear to enjoy goading each other on the golf
course, and it's a relationship played out in front of the reporters
who follow the president from hole to hole.
   When Bush missed a three-foot putt, another ball magically
appeared in front of him. He missed that too. Another ball suddenly
was provided. He missed again. Finally, on the fourth try, Bush sank
the ball.
   ``One of the advantages of being president is you get to putt
until you make it,'' said Bush's son to reporters and photographers.
   It was George W. Bush, after all, who dared the president to jump
into the chilly Atlantic with his trousers on _ for $11. And the
president took him up on it.
   ``For a guy your age, you hit pretty good,'' is a common
observation from Bush, 42, on the performance of Bush, 65.
   The constant back-and-forth reveals a closeness between father
and son that is apparent even to the most cynical observers. His son
sometimes calls the president ``Mr. Smooth'' on the golf course, and
sometimes refers to him as ``Mr. President.'' And, when he seems to
forget the cameras are rolling, it's the more straightforward
``Dad.''
   And so it goes, following Bush and company at a near-daily ritual
as the president enjoys a vacation scheduled to last until Labor Day.
   He boats, he jogs, he plays tennis, but most of all the president
is using his free time to brush up on his golf.
   ``Just trying to come back after years of not playing,'' Bush
says.
   Bush has steadfastly waved off serious questions by reporters on
the golf course.
   ``Hey listen,'' Bush said the other day. ``Vacation. I never take
questions on the golf course. It gets you in real trouble _ very
serious trouble. I can't do it. It violates all kinds of rules.''
   Bush almost always drives his own golf cart around the course, as
does his son. They are followed by carts containing playing
partners, the White House physician, military attache, Secret
Service agents and a variety of aides.
   In addition to his running banter with reporters, Bush also
frequently addresses the golf ball.
   ``C'mon, to the left,'' the nation's chief executive directed the
ball to no effect. On another occasion: ``Golly. Get up there.''
   And sometimes the president does joking dedications. Such as,
when he was playing with two of his sons, George W. and Jeb: ``I'm
dedicating this shot to my wife, Barbara, who's been such a
wonderful father to these boys here and who couldn't make it up here
today to the course.''
   In addition to being allowed to retake putts, Bush enjoys another
advantage of being president: His final scores are never revealed by
the White House.

   Former Gov. Ray Blanton has taken a job
selling used cars and trucks.
   Blanton, who served two years in prison after leaving office,
said he has been in training for the job for about two weeks.
   ``I'm healthy as a horse, broke, but not broken,'' he said
Tuesday. Blanton has been working at Bolton Ford-Mercury for two
weeks.
   He ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year.
   Blanton, 60, served time for extortion, conspiracy and mail fraud

   The show goes on in the killer whale tank where
an aggressive orca bled to death after ramming her performing
partner before thousands of spectators.
   Sea World officials say they are continuing the shows to maintain
the routine for the park's other whales, including the orphaned
11-month-old calf, Baby Shamu, but environmentalists say the death
of the 6,000-pound Kandu points up that the giant creatures should
not be in captivity.
   ``Killer whales live out in the wild to be 50 to 70 years old but
only seven to eight years following their capture and this is one of
the reasons why Greenpeace has a long-standing opposition to their
captivity,'' said Ben Deeble with Greenpeace in Seattle.
   But Sea World veterinarian Jim McBain and other whale experts
said the altercation between the whales was neither unusual nor
unprecedented.
   Ken Norris, professor at the University of California, Santa
Cruz, who has studied whales for 35 years, said killer whales and
other marine mammals often fight, ram, chase and nip each other as
part of maintaining a social hierarchy.
   A necropsy on the 14-year-old Kandu revealed that she suffered an
upper jaw fracture after striking Corky, a 25-year-old, 8,000-pound
female killer whale. The fractured jaw triggered a hemorrhage into
her nasal passages.
   Kandu died Monday about 45 minutes after the collision.
   ``This is a difficult time for us,'' whale trainer Mike Scarpuzzi
told the audience at a shortened show Tuesday.
   ``The best thing to do is to get back into the daily routine with
normal exercise and activity that these whales so desperately
need,'' he said. ``What we're hoping is to get the baby back into a
sequence she is accustomed to.''
   ``The baby was showing a little confusion ... and then acts as if
she's expecting mom to show up at any time,'' McBain said. ``She was
agitated (Monday) night, but she's much more relaxed now.''
   Baby Shamu was nearly weaned at the time of her mother's death,
getting 90 percent of her diet from the 40-45 pounds of fish she
eats daily. McBain said he was optimistic that Baby Shamu was
sufficiently independent to survive the loss of her mother.
   Deeble wasn't so optimistic.
   ``Killer whales in captivity have a poor history of success and
having calves and the chances of having them live to adults is
poor,'' he said. ``Now in this case, where the mother is dead, it's
going to cut (Baby Shamu's) chances of survival.''

<HEAD>Experts Say 8 Children Were Victims Of Contaminated Drinking Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tainted drinking water has been linked to the
cancer deaths of two children and the health problems of six others,
according to two experts cited in a lawsuit against a defense
contractor and the Denver Water Board.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of several
families in the Friendly Hills subdivision, claims that pollutants
from Martin Marietta Corp.'s aerospace plant at Waterton
contaminated their water supply.
   The families say the Water Board knew about the contaminated
water long before it closed its Kassler treatment facility, located
downstream from the aerospace plant. It was closed in December 1985
because of tainted water.
   Martin Marietta and the water board deny the allegations. The
Environmental Protection Agency and the state Health Department say
there is no evidence to link the deaths and disease with Martin
Marietta or the Kassler plant.
   Dr. Janette D. Sherman, former adviser to the EPA on toxic
substances, said she had examined six Friendly Hills children with
health problems, including cancer, seizure disorders and a heart
birth defect, as well as the medical records of two children who
died of cancer.
   Sherman concluded the deaths and diseases of the children ``were
caused by exposure to contaminated Kassler water.''
   Dr. David Ozonoff, chief of the environmental health section of
the Boston University School of Public Health, said the children's
conditions were caused by exposure to water contaminated by one or
more toxic chemicals.
   Among the chemicals he mentioned was hydrazine, which is used as
a rocket fuel at the Martin Marietta plant.
   Neither Sherman nor Ozonoff said whether the aerospace plant was
to blame for the contaminated water.
   The plaintiffs are hoping to convince a federal judge they have
enough evidence to go to trial.
   Martin Marietta officials on Tuesday disputed the physicians'
findings.
   ``We continue to believe that none of the plaintiffs have
suffered injuries from anything that Martin Marietta has done,''
said Judy Stowell, a company spokeswoman.

<HEAD>Maryland Regents Chairman Quits Over Turmoil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the University of Maryland Board
of Regents has resigned in a swirl of controversy over his role in
causing the resignation of the new president of the system's
Baltimore campus.
   Peter F. O'Malley resigned Tuesday following an admission last
week that he made a mistake in proposing to move two professional
schools from the jurisdiction of the University of Maryland at
Baltimore. That proposal caused the abrupt resgination Aug. 14 of
UMAB President Augustus A. White III.
   The resignation of White, a prominent Harvard surgeon whose
hiring was seen by the faculty as a beacon of leadership for their
campus into the 1990s, infuriated the 32-member faculty senate. The
senate voted Monday to condemn O'Malley's call to transfer the
schools of social work and community planning and law from Baltimore
to Prince George's County, where O'Malley, a lawyer, is politically
powerful.
   ``I am a realist. My profession is to solve problems. I have gone
from being part of the solution side of the equation to being on the
problem side,'' O'Malley said in resigning. ``The alarming number of
distractions and the inability to focus on the issues cause me to
take this step.''
   White was upset that neither he nor faculty members were
consulted about the move, which he said O'Malley presented to him as
a done deal.
   O'Malley admitted his blunder last week and apologized for his
``serious and significant mistake'' that prompted White to quit
before he had even started work.
   ``Mr. O'Malley has done the right thing. I hope his decision will
make it more likely we'll be able to get Gus White to reconsider
coming here or at least help us get another candidate of equal
quality to become president of our campus,'' said Robert Bennett,
president of the UMAB faculty senate.
   White said through a spokeswoman Tuesday that O'Malley's
departure did not change his feelings about resigning the UMAB
presidency.
   ``His only comment on reconsidering the job is the new
development does not change his position,'' said the assistant,
Suzanne Hunerwadeo.
   The faculty senate's resolution said O'Malley's resignation was
the best way for the new University of Maryland system to recapture
its ``high standards'' and credibility in national academic circles.
   ``In light of Mr. O'Malley's resignation, I expect to become more
involved with plans for higher education in Maryland,'' Gov. William
Donald Schaefer said.
   Schaefer said last week he supported O'Malley despite the
controversy over White.
   O'Malley had been chairman of the Board of Regents since July
1979.

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of people killed in the Dec.
21 bombing of a Boeing 747 held a memorial today in the Scottish
town where the plane crashed and demanded stricter control of
airline safety.
   Bert Ammerman, U.S. president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight
103, also paid homage to the people of Lockerbie. He said the town
will ``always be sacred and have a special place in our hearts.''
   Speaking at a memorial service in Lockerbie Town Hall, which
became a temporary mortuary following the disaster, Ammerman said:
   ``It is right and proper that from this building where so many of
our loved ones lay, that we pay public tribute to the many people
from Lockerbie and surrounding area, from all walks of life, who
enfolded us in a cloak of love, prayer and compassion and have in so
many ways helped us day by day in our mourning and our struggle to
comprehend this insanity.''
   All 259 people on the plane died, along with 11 people on the
ground. Investigators said the aircraft was downed by plastic
explosives planted inside a radio-cassette player.
   Relatives of disaster victims are pushing for an inquiry into
airplane safety and say they are not satisfied with the British
government's responses since the bombing.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, but switched to
a larger airplane and took on more passengers and baggage in London.
The flight was bound for New York.
   ``We have a duty to the memory of those lost and to travelers of
the future to demand positive ongoing action to change dramatically
the current totally unacceptable thinking on air security and
responses to international terrorism rather than outraged
condemnation of the culprits,'' said Ammerman, whose brother, Tom,
was among the passengers killed.
   He criticized the security at Heathrow Airport, saying: ``The
smugness of the security people that they are doing an effective job
came through loud and clear.
   ``The feeling we got from them was that their system was fine.
But you can't have airlines giving security to themselves. It's like
a fox watching a hen coop.'
   After the Town Hall address, Ammerman, five other Americans and
Jim Swire, head of the British Relatives' Group, visited the Garden
of Remembrance at Dryfesdale Cemetery, where they placed a wreath
containing 270 red roses, one for each victim of the crash.
   ``We come to lay a wreath of 270 flowers representing all those
from 17 different nations who lost their lives in that disaster,''
said the Rev. Patrick Keegans, a Roman Catholic priest whose home
was damaged by the plane's falling wreckage.

   FBI agents arrested the mayor on cocaine
charges after a three-year investigation into local drug trafficking.
   Mayor Tommy Voyles, 43, was freed on $50,000 bond Tuesday after
appearing before a U.S. magistrate. The mayor, who was elected in
1986, made no comment as he was led in handcuffs into the federal
courthouse.
   ``It's just a tragedy. We hate to see drug-related accusations of
public corruption,'' U.S. Attorney Chuck Banks said.
   Charges against Voyles were in an eight-count indictment issued
by a federal grand jury. The charges include one count of conspiring
to distribute cocaine and seven counts of cocaine distribution from
1987 though 1989, FBI spokesman Ron Wolfe said.
   A separate indictment charges that Voyles conspired to distribute
cocaine with William Criswell, 50, a used-car dealer, Wolfe said.
Criswell was released Tuesday on his own recognizance.

<HEAD>Pro-Choice Candidates Headed For Runoff in Hilton Head Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters gave two pro-choice
candidates the nod over an abortion opponent in a primary for a
state House seat, but no one's sure what effect abortion had on the
election.
   Neither Holly Cork, a former legislative aide, nor David Ames, a
developer, received 50 percent of the vote so they will compete in a
runoff election Sept. 5 to become the Republican candidate for the
seat left vacant by the the death of Miss Cork's father, state Rep.
William Cork.
   Democrats have not fielded a candidate for the Oct. 10 general
election.
   Unofficial results from Tuesday's primary showed Miss Cork with
2,654 votes; Ames with 2,226 votes; and, Robert Graves, a
businessman who opposes abortion, with 1,805 votes, said Frank
Gibson, chairman of the Beaufort County Republican Party. Turnout
was about 30 percent, compared with 50 percent to 65 percent in
previous primaries.
   It was South Carolina's first election since the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent decision giving states more latitude to restrict
abortion.
   The race was watched closely by legislators for signs of public
sentiment on the issue. The General Assembly is expected to tackle
the question of whether the state should restrict a woman's right to
abortion when it reconvenes in January.
   Leading up to the election the candidates and party leaders said
abortion would be a pivotal issue in the race.
   But Tony Denny, executive director of the state Republican Party,
said Tuesday that hard work may have had just as much effect.
   ``Holly Cork led the ticket but she also was a very hard-working
candidate and knocked on more doors than the other two. Whether she
led the ticket because of her stand on abortion is hard to say _ all
three were strong candidates,'' he said.
   ``As to whether or not this is a referendum on abortion, I think
has yet to be determined.''
   He said that at the candidates' last stump meeting Monday night,
two questions were asked about abortion. Questions also were raised
on taxes, tourism and beachfront management.
   Ames, 45, said the abortion issue was very important in the race.
   ``But it will probably not be as important in the runoff because
both my opponent and I have views that are much closer than the
other candidate in the primary race.''
   Miss Cork, 23, said the national attention on the abortion issue
``made the voters here think about it more.''
   ``The abortion issue has magnified in the last couple of weeks
and that's been the result of the attention that we've gotten
through the media,'' she said. But she added: ``I'm not sure if
people were voting for the other candidates for their abortion
positions.''

   A Colombian economist facing extradition to the
United States is accused of laundering huge sums of drug money,
federal officials said.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, the reputed financial wizard behind the
Medellin cartel, is a suspect in ``Operation Polar Cap,'' the
biggest money-laundering investigation ever conducted in this
country, Ronald Caffrey, a special agent in charge of the Drug
Enforcement Agency's Atlanta office, said Tuesday.
   The Medellin cartel is believed to be responsible for most
cocaine shipments to the United States.
   Martinez, 35, was arrested along with thousands of others in
Colombia in recent days in a crackdown on drug kingpins.
   Polar Cap has resulted in charges against 127 people, including
Romero, and two foreign banks.
   The multi-agency investigation spent more than two years
infiltrating a bogus gold shipping and smelting scam allegedly used
to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of drug money.
   Papers filed in federal court in Atlanta say the money-laundering
operation, known by its users as La Mina _ ``the mine'' _ laundered
some $1.2 billion in drug money between 1987 and February 1989.
   Polar Cap discoveries led to a guilty plea by Banco de Occidente
of Panama earlier this month to charges of laundering drug money.
The bank forfeited $5 million to the U.S. government. Similar
charges against the bank's parent institution, Banco de Occidente of
Cali, Colombia, were dismissed.
   A DEA agent in Atlanta, Cesar Diaz, said he visited Martinez in
the Colombian city of Medellin in October 1987. Martinez produced a
ledger showing he had laundered some $12 million in the previous
month through La Mina, Diaz said.
   ``Eduardo Martinez acted as a `broker' in negotiating with
various money-laundering groups as to their cost and services in
laundering the cartel's drug monies,'' the Atlanta indictment says.

<TEXT>
   A Panamanian opposition leader said today than
an Organization of American States effort to bring about a
democratic transfer of power in Panama has failed because Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega refused to step down as the nation's military
commander.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, a vice presidential candidate in the
abortive election process last May, told a news conference that OAS
mediators made an 11th-hour effort over the past few days to achieve
a solution.
   ``The basic result ... was to prove beyond any doubt that the one
issue that remained unresolved from beginning to end of the
negotiation was essentially General Noriega,'' Arias Calderon said.
   ``At no point did the representatives of the regime consider any
formula under which General Noriega would retire from his position
as commander in chief.''
   ``He now holds the Panamanian people as hostage,'' Arias Calderon
said, comparing the plight of his countrymen to that of the foreign
hostages being held in Lebanon.
   The opposition figure spoke hours before OAS foreign ministers
prepared to meet here today for the fourth and perhaps final time to
discuss Panama's political crisis, which began in May when
authorities voided the country's national election results.
   Panama's constitution requires a new president to take office by
Sept. 1.
   U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said Tuesday it
appears likely that Noriega will arrange for the incumbent
president, Manuel Solis Palma, a Noriega loyalist, to be replaced by
an equally reliable successor. Noriega would retain
behind-the-scenes control in defiance of Bush administration wishes.
   Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, a member of the
mediating team, indicated in Panama the group lacks time to fulfill
the OAS call for a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   ``I'm rather pessimistic,'' Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a
leader of the anti-Noriega forces in Washington, said Tuesday in a
telephone interview. ``The OAS will lose an opportunity to speak
loudly in support of democracy and freedom. I don't see within the
OAS the will to act in defense of the self-determination of the
people of Panama.''
   After a week-long visit to Panama that ended Tuesday, the
mediating team was to present a report on their efforts to the OAS
foreign ministers.
   Since May, the OAS deadline to achieve a democratic power
transfer has been extended twice. U.S. officials said Tuesday that
it is doubtful a further deadline will be set.
   Panama's election results were voided amid widespread allegations
of fraud. Independent observers said the anti-Noriega candidate,
Guillermo Endara, appeared to have won by a large margin.
   The Bush administration, Noriega's principle antagonist in the
hemisphere, has been pressing for a solution by the time the new
president is required to take office.
   ``We've supported the OAS mission,'' State Department deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday.
   ``We've supported the mandate they have to achieve a transfer of
power. We've stated very clearly that for that to occur Noriega must
go. We've stated very clearly our policy that there will be no
accommodation with the Noriega regime.''
   Sosa said Tuesday that he will close Panama's embassy here Aug.
31. That is the eve of the date on which Eric Arturo Delvalle, the
ousted president whom the United States still recognizes as the
country's legitimate authority, was scheduled to leave office.
   Delvalle was forced out by Noriega's allies 18 months ago but
Sosa, with U.S. government support, has refused to relinquish
control of the embassy.
   He said it would be inappropriate for him to remain at the
embassy after Delvalle's term expires.
   ``We have always maintained we are fighting for a constitutional
principle,'' Sosa said, adding that he and his family will move to
an apartment in Washington. He intends to continue his struggle
against Noriega, he said.

   Billionaire hoteliers Harry and Leona Helmsley
evaded both personal and business taxes by contriving a ``clever
plan'' to charge millions in personal expenses to their businesses,
a prosecutor said today.
   ``Every dollar they spent in this scheme enabled them to save on
their own taxes and their businesses,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Cathy Seibel. ``They got twice the bang of the buck.''
   The prosecutor made her closing argument after seven weeks of
testimony in Mrs. Helmsley's trial. Harry Helmsley, 80, was
separated from the case because of failing mental competence.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is accused of evading more than $1 million in
federal taxes by charging personal expenses to her businesses.
Former aides Frank Turco and Joseph Licari are charged with
assisting in the scheme.
   Mrs. Helmsley's lawyers called only four witnesses. Two of them
were tax experts who told the jury that Mrs. Helmsley and her
husband actually overpaid taxes during 1983-85, the period covered
by the indictment.
   Jurors are expected to begin deliberations Friday.
   Ms. Seibel today called Turco and Licari ``two trusted
lieutenants'' who willingly undertook the job of executing the
scheme.
   The prosecutor listed expenses allegedly mischarged by the
Helmsleys, including $1 million to enclose a pool at their
Connecticut estate, Dunnellen Hall; $500,000 for jade art; $45,000
for a clock in the shape of the Helmsley Building in Manhattan; and
purchases as minor as milk from a grocery.
   ``It was really a clever plan,'' she said.
   Ms. Seibel responded to complaints from the defense that Mrs.
Helmsley, who faces 41 counts including tax evasion, mail fraud and
conspiracy, was overcharged. ``It is not an attack on Mrs. Helmsley
but a fulfillment of our obligation to enforce the law fully and
fairly,'' she said.
   Mrs. Helmsley and Turco also are charged with conspiracy to
extort payoffs from vendors doing business with Helmsley businesses.
   The prosecution called 44 witnesses, a number of whom depicted
Mrs. Helmsley as arrogant and greedy. They described how she
disputed bills for renovations at her estate and then charged many
of them to her hotel empire.
   Three liquor salesmen testified that they were forced to pay
kickbacks to keep their accounts at Helmsley hotels.

<HEAD>Judge Tells Los Angeles Hands Off Endangered Lake</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `El Dorado ...' to CORRECT spelling of Audubon.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists have won a
victory with a judge ordering Los Angeles to temporarily stop
diverting water from streams feeding Mono Lake, a haven for birds
that has been steadily shrinking.
   Los Angeles officials said the ruling could mean depletion of
water reserves.
   El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Terrence Finney granted a
preliminary injunction Tuesday for the Audubon Society and the Mono
Lake Committee, which are trying to protect the Mono Lake nesting
grounds of California gulls.
   Finney said diversions from four of the seven streams that feed
the environmentally sensitive lake, surrounded by bizarre formations
of salt and minerals from the evaporating lake, must stop until
March 30, 1990, to allow the lake's water level to rise about two
feet.
   The judge ruled that the gulls would be threatened by coyotes
that could cross land bridges to island nesting grounds if the lake
dropped below a level of 6,377 feet above sea level.
   Finney also said mineral deposits exposed as the lake recedes
could be a source of dust hazardous to people living near the lake,
located on the arid eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada some 200
miles east of San Francisco.
   The diversions provide Los Angeles with hydroelectric power and
17 percent of its water, but combined with evaporation to lower
Mono's shoreline 43 feet between 1941 and 1981, although wet winters
have periodically raised the level a few feet.
   The city's critics have argued for years that unchecked
diversions eventually will cut the lake to a third its natural size,
raise the lake's salinity and threaten brine shrimp and birds that
eat the shrimp.
   The lake's Negit Island and Twain Island are nesting grounds for
California gulls. Finney said that when the lake drops to 6,376 feet
a land bridge forms to Negit, and at 6,373 feet there's a bridge to
Twain.
   ``Both of these islands were exposed to coyote predation earlier
in the decade as a result of land bridging, and the consequent
decline in the nesting population is still being repaired,'' he said.
   City officials say the ruling means about $15 million will have
to be allotted to purchase water and energy.
   Mitch Kodama, southern district engineer for the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power and manager of Mono Basin issues, said
the city will have to purchase an additional 50,000 acre-feet of
water, the amount needed to cover 50,000 acres one foot deep.
   Because of current drought conditions, Kodama said the city is
already buying about four times the normal amount of water from the
Metropolitan Water District, an agency that serves as a water broker
for the city and other communities in Southern California.
   ``What we see here is a fivefold increase in the amount of water
we have to purchase from MWD this year,'' Kodama said. ``Certainly,
the ruling doesn't help us during this drought year. In order to
sell us the water, it means MWD will basically be dipping into next
year's storage.''
   ``We are extremely disappointed with this ruling because we feel
there would be no significant impact to the lake's ecosystem this
year by continuing planned diversions from four Mono Basin
streams,'' said James F. Wickser, the DWP's assistant chief engineer
for water.
   Betsy Reifsnider, associate director of the Mono Lake Committee,
hailed the judge's decision.
   ``I feel this is really a victory for the people of Los Angeles
because over 60 percent of those who visit Mono Lake each year are
from Southern California. It's their lake too,'' Ms. Reifsnider said.

Antillean Airlines jet in Haiti and demand they be flown to Israel.
The pilot continued on to his destination, Curacao, without telling
passengers of the attempted hijacking, having convinced the Haitians
they bound for New York. After landing, the pilot told passengers to
evacuate and two men were arrested.

   Rescuers pulled more bodies from the River Thames
today, bringing to 48 the number of people known to have died when a
pleasure boat sank after being rammed by a barge, police said.
   Police believe the death toll from Sunday's accident could be as
high as 57 and searchers were continuing to look for more bodies.
There are 79 known survivors of the disaster.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in
keeping with British practice, said 17 bodies were recovered from
the river Tuesday night and through today from several locations.
Some bodies had been carried for miles by the strong tides.
   The 90-ton Marchioness, carrying revelers on a late-night party
cruise, sank after being hit from behind by the 1,475-ton dredger
Bowbelle near Southwark Bridge in central London.
   The Marchioness, which had been hired for the 26th birthday party
of a London financier, was licensed to carry 149 passengers and two
crew members.
   Work began today to refloat the Marchioness so that it could be
towed downriver to a drydock at Greenwich.
   Salvage supervisor Ron Livett said it would probably be scrapped.
``Who wants to sail in her after this?'' he said.

   A suspect in a convenience store holdup has
been charged with intimidating a witness, by means of the one phone
call he was allowed from the police station after he was arrested,
police said.
   ``I've had prisoners use our telephone to order a pizza, but
never to call someone to intimidate them,'' Police Chief Thomas
O'Loughlin said.
   Police said Frenchman Glover, also known as Teddy Glover, 21, was
charged with armed robbery, conspiracy to commit a felony and
intimidation of a prosecution witness.
   Jeffrey Barber, 18, was also charged with armed robbery and
conspiracy to commit a felony in the holdup Monday night.
   Police said two men entered the store and put a kitchen knife to
a clerk's ribs, threatening to kill the clerk, then escaped with
$214.77
   Glover and Barber were arrested a short time later. The money
from the robbery and a knife were recovered at a residence, police
said.
   When Glover was allowed to make a phone call, he called a witness
at the residence and threatened to kill him if he cooperated with
police, O'Loughlin said. The person immediately reported the threat
to police, he said.

   A blown elevator valve aboard the
USS John F. Kennedy was blamed for panic and most of the 30 injuries
among some 60 civilian visitors.
   A ``vent, really a pressure release valve, popped off,'' Lt. Fred
Henney, public affairs officer aboard the Kennedy, said of the
incident Tuesday.
   A small amount of pressurized air, water and hydraulic fluid was
released after the valve popped, he said. It is part of the
hydraulic system that raises and lowers the lift, which can hoist
two bomb-laden F-14 Tomcat fighter jets to the carrier's flight deck.
   Originally, officials thought a broken hydraulic line spraying
fluid caused the more than 60 riders to panic and stampede off the
platform. ``There was no explosion, no ruptured line,'' Henney said.
   ``Panic seems to have been what caused most of the problems and
injuries,'' said Navy Cmdr. Shawn Etter, a ship's officer.
   Two of those hurt were admitted to Broward General Medical
Center. Dorothy Klaer, 61, complained of chest pains, and Francis
Harrington, 61, had a possible stroke. Klaer is in satisfactory
condition and Harrington's condition is fair, said hospital
spokesman Craig Biles.
   The rest of the injured were treated for minor bumps and bruises,
and had hydraulic fluid flushed from their eyes in the ship's
infirmary, said Dominic Lanza, district supervisor of Broward
County's emergency medical services.

<TEXT>
   Nabih Berri, leader of the Syrian-backed
Shiite Moslem militia, said today that his forces will shell French
warships gathering in the eastern Mediterranean if they approach the
Lebanese coast.
   Moslems accuse the French of backing Lebanese Christians. ``We as
nationalist and Moslem forces do not want a clash with France, but
we have to defend our dignity and homeland,'' Berri said.
   Also today, an Air France jetliner was hijacked by a man who
reportedly demanded that an international conference on Lebanon be
held.
   The Airbus A300 with 115 people aboard landed in Algeria, and an
Air France spokeswoman said the hijacking ended less than an hour
later with the arrest of a suspect. The spokesman gave no other
details.
   In another development, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan,
president of the United Arab Emirates, called today for an emergency
Arab summit to assign Arab peacekeeping troops to Lebanon.
   ``If Lebanon collapses, that will be the end of the Arab
League,'' Zayed said in an interview with the Paris-based
Al-Hawadass weekly that was circulated by the official WAM news
agency.
   A three-member Arab League committee made up of officials from
Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco has been unable to find a
settlement in the battle between Christian troops and Syrian and
allied Moslem forces.
   In Paris, European Community foreign ministers today issued an
urgent call for an immediate cease-fire in Lebanon and announced
that a fact-finding mission would be sent to Beirut within days.
   The ministers said the situation in Lebanon is ``fraught with
danger'' and ``urgently appealed to all parties to cease all gunfire
and bombing on land and sea and all forms of blockade and to
implement a total ceasefire ...''
   Syrian and Christian artillery exchanged fire sporadically in and
around Beirut during the night, violating a 6-day-old cease-fire.
Police reported one person was killed and 11 wounded.
   That raised the casualty toll since the latest civil war fighting
broke out March 8 to 790 killed and 2,201 wounded.
   There were renewed fears that France would join the fray. In
Beirut, the pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq daily declared in a front-page
headline: ``France reinforces its fleet. Lebanon and the region face
the threat of a large explosion.''
   Most of the eight-ship French task force, led by the aircraft
carrier Foch carrying nearly 2,000 marines, was expected off Lebanon
later today.
   French officials have said the flotilla was dispatched to
evacuate 7,000 French nationals, mostly Lebanese with dual
nationality, if the 5-month-old battle between Christian leader Gen.
Michel Aoun and the Syrian army worsens.
   But the mission has been threatened by Syrian-backed Moslem
forces, who claim the warships were sent to support Aoun.
   Aoun's estimated 20,000 troops, outnumbered about 3-1 by the
Syrians and their Moslem allies, are besieged in the Christian
enclave north of Beirut.
   Berri said his 6,000-strong militia, which has heavy artillery
and tanks, has ordered all its men in south Lebanon to ``carry arms
and join other Moslem and nationalist forces in confronting the new
crusaders.''
   Berri said in a statement published by Beirut newspapers that
France will be held responsible for the consequences resulting from
any military intervention by its warships in Lebanon.
   The Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
threatened suicide bombings. The Revolutionary Justice Organization,
a faction allied to Hezbollah, has warned that two American
hostages, Joseph Cicippio, 58, and Edward Tracy, 58, are in danger
if the French force intervenes in Lebanon.
   Aoun was quoted as saying in an interview with Paris' France-Soir
daily that he had received military supplies from France as well as
his primary backer, Iraq, despite a Syrian blockade. Iraq is Syria's
main Arab rival.
   Aoun said: ``Of course, I wish for French military intervention,
but I cannot compromise the French position.'' He said he expected
the French warships ``to be put at my disposal to assure freedom of
movement in territorial waters,'' in an apparent reference to the
Syrian blockade.
   The Christian Ad-diyar daily, which is close to Aoun, said the
French flotilla was ``coordinating with the American 6th Fleet and
its radar bases in Cyprus,'' 100 miles northwest of Lebanon.
   Chris Shepherd, spokesman for the British forces on Cyprus,
denied the Ad-Diyar report. He told The Associated Press in Nicosia,
the island's capital: ``There is no such operations room. Our
aircraft are not on alert.''
   Asked if there were any arrangements for cooperation with the
French and the U.S. 6th Fleet, Shepherd noted: ``I have no idea and
it would be inappropriate for me to comment.''

<HEAD>Starr Details Drinking in Court Deposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ringo Starr says he drank 16 bottles of wine a day
at one point during his bout with alcoholism and was frequently
drunk while recording an album he doesn't want released, according
to court documents.
   The former Beatles drummer detailed his drinking problems in a
deposition filed with Fulton County Superior Court Judge Clarence
Cooper, who is considering Starr's lawsuit to stop release of the
album. A 30-day order blocking release expires Thursday.
   In his lawsuit against CRS Records of College Park, Ga., and
producer Chips Moman, Starr contends his performance on the album,
recorded in 1987 but never released, is below his standards. Moman
has said the record could earn $3.5 million if it is released now,
while Starr is on his first U.S. concert tour since 1966.
   Starr recently underwent a much-publicized treatment for
alcoholism.
   ``Six or seven years ago, I felt I had a real problem,'' he said
in the deposition, filed earlier this week. ``But I couldn't seem to
deal with it.
   ``I went through a lot of the different stages where I thought,
`I'll only drink wine,' and I certainly did that for a while. But, I
mean, 16 bottles of wine a day was as bad as drinking hard liquor.''
   Starr said that during the recording sessions with Moman, he and
the other musicians sometimes were ``all under the influence.'' He
also said marijuana was smoked.
   Moman has testified that he did not allow liquor in his Memphis,
Tenn., studio.

   James Meredith Jr., son of the civil
rights activist who was the first black admitted to the University
of Mississippi, has been sentenced to one year's house arrest for
two counts of vehicular manslaughter.
   Meredith, who was sentenced Tuesday in Superior Court, had
pleaded no contest in February to charges stemming from a 1987 car
crash that killed Paul Huard, 44, and Kevin Jones, 26.
   Huard and Jones, who worked with Meredith at a restaurant, were
riding in Meredith's sports car when it missed a curve and struck a
large boulder. Police said speed and alcohol were factors in the
crash. Meredith, 20, was seriously injured.
   Justice Roland Cole sentenced Meredith to two years in prison,
both suspended, followed by two years' probation. He also was fined
$350 and his license was suspended for five years.
   Meredith, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, will serve
his house arrest in Pennsylvania, Deputy District Attorney Anne
Jordan said.
   The elder Meredith was admitted to the University of Mississippi
in 1962, becoming the first black to enroll there. Four years later
he was wounded by shotgun blasts during a civil rights march across
Mississippi.

<HEAD>President Lauds Gorbachev's Advice to Polish Communists</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs files, moves up material on Colombia, updates hijacking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today said that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's reported counsel to Poland's
Communists to take part in the new government there was ``very
positive.''
   Bush, in a question-and-answer session with reporters at his
vacation home, said that although many changes are taking place in
Poland, ``there will be bumps in the road as these countries move
toward more democracy.''
   ``I thought the comment I saw attributed to Mr. Gorbachev was
very positive in this regard,'' he said.
   The president was referring to reports that Gorbachev had called
Poland's Communist leaders and apparently urged them to back away
from their hard line against participating in a government led by
the Solidarity independent trade movement.
   Asked about the situation in Colombia, where President Virgilio
Barco is engaged in a crackdown on drug lords who have carried a
wave of assassinations, Bush said: ``I have great respect for what
President Barco is trying to do. I am convinced he is determined to
whip the problem, to beat it.''
   And he also said the process of extraditing drug-trafficking
suspects to the United States for trial ``should go forward.''
   Regarding the possibility of sending U.S. troops to help Colombia
fight drug cartels, Bush said ``that whole question of troop
speculation, I think, got out of whack.'' Officials have said there
are no plans to send troops and Barco does not want them.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said Tuesday that the U.S.
government was awaiting a request from the Colombian government for
non-military help. She said the United States stands ready to
provide a variety of assistance, including anti-terrorist training
to Colombian judges, if requested.
   Bush also said he has no problem with the French sending warships
to the Mediterranean, although pro-Iranian militants holding
American hostages in Lebanon have reacted threateningly to that move.
   ``The French have had a longstanding history in Lebanon. They
have tried to be a catalyst for peace in Lebanon....I am not about
to criticize the French for what they are doing,'' Bush said.
   On the turmoil in Lebanon, he said: ``I feel a certain
frustration about Lebanon because we have not been able to be a
catalyst for peace.'' He said the United States remains available to
``consult with individual parties'' in the Middle East to try to
resolve the nation's civil war.
   Bush said he had no details of today's hijacking of an Air France
plane other than that the White House situation room had informed
him it had occurred. The plane subsequently landed in Algiers and an
unarmed Algerian emigre who had commandeered the airliner
surrendered.
   The president covered a wide range of subjects in his interview
with Maine reporters and a small group of national traveling press
corps.
   He said first lady Barbara Bush was fine following her eye
examination in Washington on Tuesday. After the news conference, he
took the reporters and camera crews to the tennis court on his
property to see his wife playing a game of doubles tennis.
   ``She'll kill us,'' the president said as he led the entourage to
the court.
   Mrs. Bush, grumbling about her tennis game, was asked how she
felt. At first she blurted out jokingly that she was ``just sick
about'' her game. She interrupted herself with a laugh and said,
``No, I feel wonderful.''
   The first lady posed for the cameras cross-eyed in a gesture
mocking the eye irritation that accompanies her Graves disease, a
thyroid imbalance. Bush ran on to the court laughingly and told her,
``Don't do that'' as he put his hand over her eyes.
   Doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center prescribed prednisone,
a cortisone derivative, to help combat symptoms of the disease,
which include eye tearing and some double-vision, according to a
statement issued by the first lady's office.
   On other matters, the president said:
   _Vice President Dan Quayle accurately stated U.S. policy when he
said this week that humanitarian aid to the Contras rebels should
continue even after Nicaragua's elections in February if the Contras
do not find the internal conditions satisfactory to permit their
return to their homeland.

Some of it is fundamental values.''

   The Defense Nuclear Agency plans to decide
within 10 days whether a Texas ranch still will be considered as a
possible test site to simulate underground effects of nuclear
explosions, congressional aides said today.
   Officials from the agency met with aides to Sens. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, this morning and said an
announcement on the future of the site near Del Rio would likely be
made next week, according to spokesmen for the senators.
   The proposed test site about 25 miles from Del Rio has drawn
opposition from area residents who are worried about the possible
effects the non-nuclear explosions could have on the water supply
and environment.
   Gramm plans to meet with officials and residents of the west
Texas city of 40,000 on Monday to discuss the tests and ``simply
give them a chance to tell him directly how they feel,'' said Larry
Neal, a spokesman for Gramm.
   The agency has spent two years chosing a site for the series of
graduated explosions, which would culminate in November 1992 with a
470-ton blast using conventional explosives. The tests are to
simulate the effects of nuclear explosions on underground missile
silos.
   The agency says the explosions are designed to have no
significant environmental impact.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:

   Winona (Minn.) Daily News on Poland:
   In a very short period of time, Solidarity _ a political alliance
that was outlawed until a few months ago _ is taking control of the
government.
   Now, Poland's leaders have agreed to allow a Solidarity member to
serve as prime minister.
   This shocking change in Poland _ a revolution of sorts _ reflects
the serious problems Eastern Europe has suffered under Communist
control. The drawbacks of Communism have been magnified in Poland
because of strict military control and harsh enforcement of martial
law.....
   After Walesa and Solidarity have their government in place, the
pressure for change will be incredible. The Polish people have
called for political reforms, but these reforms will only last if
the economic and social qualities of life improve.
   Solidarity's achievements to date are historic. But bigger jobs
await Walesa and his coalition. They now have to answer to the
people who brought them to power.

   The Herald, Everett, Wash., on Poland:
   The apparent restraint of the Soviet Union in the face of rapid
political change in Poland represents a hopeful sign of growing
Russian political maturity.
   For those in the West who have watched the progress of the
democratic movement in Poland, the possibility of a Solidarity-led
coalition government is an exciting prospect. But the excitement
must be tempered with a certain amount of caution for both the
reaction of the Soviet Union and the prospects of the government in
changing Poland's economic conditions.
   The Soviet Union's top political officials and its press are
sending carefully weighed signals of what news reports call
``deliberate equanimity.'' That is the proper attitude of a
superpower toward peaceful political change, even when that change
is dramatic and right on its own borders.
   ... If Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his allies continue
on their steady, reasonable path in regard to Poland, both nations
can ultimately devote more of their energies to dealing with their
own problems. And the West can have a little more faith in the
sincerity of Mr. Gorbachev's reform efforts.
   But for now, the West can only hope that things between the
Soviet Union and Poland continue on the same intelligent path.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on sending U.S. troops to Colombia:
   Colombia declared war on the mighty drug cartels with 10,000
arrests last weekend. The United States must be Colombia's
staunchest ally in that war, lending all appropriate assistance _
short of sending troops.
   ... As the largest market for narcotics in the world, this
country has an immediate interest in stopping the production and
distribution of cocaine. The United States also has an interest in
stability and democracy in this hemisphere _ both of which are under
attack from drug-inspired corruption and violence.
   Yet the front-line fighters against the Colombian cartels must be
Colombians.

   The Fayetteville (N.C.) Times on Oliver North:
   A new analysis of Oliver North's case shows that North would have
gone to prison for the three crimes for which he was indicted and
convicted, had federal sentencing standards been in effect at the
time he committed those crimes.
   According to those standards, adopted in November 1987, North
would have served at least 21 months for aiding and abetting
obstruction of Congress, destroying government documents and
accepting an unlawful gratuity.
   That's interesting, but we already know that the judge could have
done that, standards or no standards, but instead bought North's
explanation that he was just ``a pawn in a chess game played by
giants.'' All the study does is tell us what we already know: that
the sentence was not proportionate to the crime.
   ... This is not to begrudge North his freedom, only to
re-emphasize the point that he's had his break. ... If President
Bush should give him another break _ a full pardon _ that can
logically be taken not as an act of compassion but as a gesture of
approval of North's admitted attempt to do an end run around the
American people, who opposed the Contra war, around their elected
representatives in Congress, and around the president he nominally
served.

   The Telegraph of Nashua, N.H., on the war on drugs:
   President Bush wants an all-out war on drugs. The problem is he
can't afford one. The truth is he doesn't know how to finance it
without doing what he said he wouldn't do _ raise taxes.
   The drug war, full details of which haven't been worked out,
envisions a 49 percent increase in federal treatment money for 1990,
to $925 million; $1.2 billion for new prison construction; a $200
million increase for state and local law enforcement; and $50
million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, most of
it for security improvements at public housing projects.
   Twenty-seven percent of Americans consider drugs the biggest
problem facing the country. More than 75 percent want tougher laws
to deal with it. Will they support a tax increase to pay for it? Who
knows?
   Bush promised to have some answers on September 5, after he
returns from a three-week vacation in Maine. All things seem
possible in Kennebunkport, of course, but Bush still will have to
face a hostile Democratic House that would love to see him break his
no-new-tax pledge. Here's hoping he comes back with more answers and
fewer promises he can never keep.

   The Register-Guard of Eugene, Ore., on generic drug safety:
   The scandal that is clouding confidence in the purity of generic
drugs threatens to deprive American consumers of a tremendous
benefit. ... Generic drugs cost less than name-brand compounds . ..
but chemically (they) are the same as their name-brand counterparts
_ or so consumers have been told.
   ... Trust in the quality of generic drugs has been (shaken).
Three former employees of the Food and Drug Administration's generic
drug division have pleaded guilty to accepting payoffs for
expediting drug companies' applications for approval. Two companies
have admitted supplying the FDA with false information about generic
drugs.
   ... If large batches of common generic drugs are found to be
deficient (in purity, potency or ability to enter the bloodstream),
... the potential effects on the health of countless Americans will
be incalculable.

   Watertown (Wis.) Daily Times on college sports:
   The women's movement has been handed fresh evidence to bolster
its contention that women are equal to men in most ways, and
superior in some. Henceforth they can cite a study which makes some
pointed comparisons between male and female basketball players at
colleges with major programs.
   The study's findings scuttle the common notion that women players
are not as ``serious'' about the game as the men. The fact is that
women's basketball is highly competitive, which is reflected in the
discovery that female players spend as much time at the sport as the
men do.
   ... But while they go at the game just as hard as their male
counterparts do, the women outplay them academically: they attend
classes more regularly, study more, and get higher grades.
   ... Robert Rossi, a research scientist involved in the study
project for the National Collegiate Athletic Association, asked the
right question: ``How can you make the men do it?'' Not an easy
task, especially since a high percentage of male athletes have their
sights set on a professional sports career.
   It seems unlikely that we'll see a rush of male players, stung by
the report, striving to match the women's academic performance. Yet
some may take this as a challenge. They should be encouraged by
college administrators and others to go for it.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Israel:
   It is expected of Americans now to join the universal
condemnation of South Africa for its continuing oppression of people
of color through its system of apartheid. But it is still American
to consider Israel our most important ally that can do no wrong in
the Middle East. It is time for that to change. Israel must continue
to be an ally, but not without severe criticism for its human rights
violations.
   For too many years now, Israel has been conducting as systematic
a persecution of Palestinians as the white minority has thrust on
blacks in South Africa. Indeed the human rights abuses in the Gaza
occupied territory lately rival those in any of the black townships.
   As painful as it may be, politically or personally, America must
begin to condemn Israel's military occupation and crimes against
humanity in the Gaza strip.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on Voyager 2:
   Humanity's thirst for knowledge of the heavens will be quenched
again as Voyager 2 pulls alongside the planet Neptune.
   What a bargain.
   Launched 12 years ago, this tiny exploratory robot has far
exceeded anyone's expectations. The price tag: $865 million, more
than the average taxpayer can comprehend, but less than the cost of
a pair of B-2 bombers.
   In return for the investment, Voyager 2 has beamed back priceless
information about the solar system, including extraordinary
portraits of some 40 worlds along the way.
   President Bush has challenged Americans to continue our adventure
in space through continued exploration. Voyager is proof that it can
be done, that knowledge has value, and that there are bargains even

   The Watertown (S.D.) Public Opinion on whistleblowers:
   Even as you read this, officials somewhere in the depths of the
federal government may be selling this country's interests down the
river.
   ... If we lived in a perfect world, the higher-ups would ferret
out the wrongdoing, announce it at a press conference and mend their
errant ways. Sometimes they do.
   Unfortunately, as the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals
demonstrated, government officials are less than candid when the
mischief is politically embarrassing to an incumbent president.
   Enter the whistleblowers, government employees outraged enough by
the shenanigans to tip off the media.
   They deserve public service awards. Apparently, the U.S. Justice
Department would rather throw them in jail. Deputy Assistant
Attorney General John Keeney informed Congress recently that the
Justice Department would resume prosecuting government employees who
leak information about its criminal investigations.
   (The policy's) vagueness would allow the Justice Department to
prosecute the whistleblowers selectively. That's almost certain to
lead to politically motivated witchhunts for those who made somebody
important look bad.
   We simply can't afford to muzzle the whistleblowers and the media
watchdogs.

   The Post-Tribune of Gary, Ind., on stockades in Arkansas:
   It's easy to understand the frustration of officials in the
Arkansas community of Dermott who recently decided to deal with
lawbreaking minors by throwing their parents into a public stockade.
   If anything has characterized the last three decades of American
society it is the deterioration of discipline among youth _ both at
home and in school.
   In most schools, teachers are no longer allowed to hand out
corporal punishment. At home, fewer and fewer youth grow up in
stable two-parent families. In households with two parents, (often)
both work.
   The result is many parents seem not to have the time nor the
inclination to discipline their children properly. They then
complain when school authorities try to do the job.
   Dermott officials hope the humiliation of parents being put on
public display in a stockade will spur them to discipline their
children.
   Pressure on parents through public humiliation, however, is
unlikely to achieve the desired effect. What it's more apt to do is
clog up the courts with challenges to the ordinance's legality. That
will teach youth another important lesson _ if you don't like
something, sue.

   The Bangor (Maine) Daily News on President Bush vacationing in
Maine:
   President Bush is in Maine for a three-week vacation. Since we
don't have to direct the traffic in Kennebunkport, we're pleased as
punch that he's here. The president's catching the end of summer on
the Maine coast can't help but have a beneficial influence on
international affairs. His prolonged visit even makes up for the
fact that his predecessor never found the time to set foot in Maine
during either of his two terms, even though he was reminded on
several occasions that you can get here from down Washington way.
   ... President Reagan came from a state where the sun sets over
the ocean. In Maine, that's where the sun rises. Surely, as a
president looks out over the water and ponders his responsibilities,
that must make a difference.

   Prime Minister-designate Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, under pressure from Polish Communists and the Soviet
Union, promised today to give the party a bigger role in the
Solidarity-led government he is forming.
   Mazowiecki told Solidarity lawmakers that he would give the party
more than the two ministry posts, defense and interior, that had
been previously promised. The two ministries control the police and
the army.
   Mazowiecki, speaking to the Solidarity caucus in the National
Assembly, said that with the Communists retaining control of those
powerful ministries, it would be foolish to try to exclude them from
the rest of the government.
   The speech by Mazowiecki followed a 40-minute telephone talk
Tuesday between party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in which it was agreed that it was
``impossible'' to have a government without the Communists, a party
spokesman said.
   It was highly unusual for the party to publicize such a telephone
conversation, announcing it at a news conference.
   The announcement appeared designed to stress the Soviet Union's
interest in having a strong Communist presence in the next
government, but still reflected Moscow's acceptance of the idea that
the party should reach an accommodation with the Solidarity-led
coalition.
   President Bush today described Gorbachev's reported counsel to
Poland's Communists to take part in the new government as ``very
positive.'' Speaking with reporters at his vacation home in Maine,
Bush told Americans they should expect ``bumps in the road as these
countries move toward more democracy.''
   There were signs today that Solidarity and the Polish Communist
Party were nearing an understanding.
   Solidarity, which last week was chosen by President Wojciech
Jaruzelski to lead the next government, had only promised that the
Communists would retain control of the defense and interior
ministries.
   But Mazowiecki warned Solidarity deputies today that such a limit
could backfire. ``The Communist Party in total negation would be a
trap for the country,'' he said.
   Hinting that the party would eventually take back power by force
unless a compromise was reached, he said: ``No opposition in the
world which ... Has the army and security services ... remains the
opposition.''
   ``Our new partners must not feel like secondary partners.''
   The lower house of the National Assembly, the Sejm, is to vote
Thursday on Mazowiecki's nomination. Ratification is expected
because Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has put together a
Solidarity-led majority by wooing two minor parties formerly allied
with the Communists.
   Mazowiecki did not say how many government ministries would be
apportioned. He said he plans to present a government within a week.
   Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said that Mazowiecki's envoy,
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, had his first preliminary coalition talks on
Tuesday with party Central Committee Secretary Leszek Miller.
Bisztyga refused comment on the party's coalition demands.
   Mazowiecki said there are no specific decisions, but it must be a
``broad coalition.
   ``On cannot today form a government in Poland other than a broad
coalition having the support of all forces sitting at the Sejm,'' he
said.
   Mazowiecki told the Solidarity lawmakers that he had Jaruzelski's
assurance the army and security forces would cooperate with a
government led by the opposition movement they had long sought to
repress.
   He said ``there is a feeling of danger'' within those forces that
must not be aggravated if the democratization of Poland is to be
successful.
   ``This is political wisdom not to increase this feeling of danger
in order not to create a feeling of aggression,'' he said.
   He also took a mild stance toward the removal of party loyalists
from state jobs. He said he plans no ``witch hunts'' when he takes
over. His only criteria for employment would be ``competence and
loyalty to the new government,'' he said.
   The Communist Party has been pressing for maximum representation
in the new cabinet as Mazowiecki holds intensive negotiations on the
delicate task of balancing competing political interests.
   The communist Politburo met Tuesday to fashion its position.
   Afterward, party spokesman Bisztyga reported the
Rakowski-Gorbachev telephone conversation, where he said it was
agreed that solving Poland's problems ``is impossible'' without the
Communist Party.
   Bisztyga said the two men held ``a friendly conversation'' and
that Gorbachev ``expressed confidence that the Polish party would
successfully solve the social and economic problems in the interest
of socialism and voiced the conviction that solving these problems
is impossible without the (party).''
   He said the Soviet Union was interested in a ``significant''
Communist participation ``in shaping the social and economic and
political situation'' to assure the appropriate development of
Poland.
   Mazowiecki reiterated today that he understands Poland's
``geographic place'' and that it belongs to the Warsaw Pact military
alliance.
   As the unprecedented jousting for power continues, Mazowiecki
faces tackling Poland's tremendous economic problems _ a $39 billion
foreign debt, chronic shortages of even basic foods and declining
industrial production.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested five men suspected in the
assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, the presidential hopeful whose
slaying caused a government crackdown on Colombia's notorious drug
traffickers.
   Also Tuesday, police said they had begun proceedings to extradite
the reputed finance chief of the Medellin drug cartel to the United
States, where he faces conspiracy and drug trafficking charges.
   Colombian newspapers, meanwhile, reported today the arrest of an
alleged drug trafficker wanted in the United States on smuggling
charges. The Bogota daily El Espectador said a U.S. extradition
request for Rafael Orlandes Gamboa is pending with Colombian
authorities.
   A source at the international airport said that a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration aircraft was parked there, apparently for
use in extradition. The source spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, asked about the aircraft on
``CBS This Morning,'' declined specific comment but said: ``...you
can be sure we're in a position to take full advantage of the
developments down there.''
   The flurry of drug arrests in Colombia, one of the narcotics
capitals of the world, was spurred by Friday's killing of Galan.
Police say drug traffickers put a $500,000 price on Galan's head.
   The arrests Tuesday in downtown Bogota of five men believed
directly involved in the killing reflect an unusual efficiency on
the part of security forces. Never before in a major drug-related
assassination had police announced key arrests with such speed. In
many cases no arrests were ever made.
   The five men were presented to reporters at national police
headquarters, where they were under heavy guard. Police said all
were Colombians.
   They stood silently, their faces fixed in a blank expression.
They were dressed in casual clothing and four appeared to be in
their 20s or 30s. The fifth was older, perhaps in his 50s, with
graying hair.
   A police communique gave their names and said they were captured
earlier Tuesday but provided no further details.
   The men were not known members of the drug trafficking community,
which authorities say routinely hires killers and helps finance the
training of shadowy death squads in association with right-wing
extremists.
   Several men are believed to have participated in the killing of
Galan Friday at a campaign rally in Soacha, a town outside Bogota.
   Witnesses and police say one man pumped five bullets into Galan's
abdomen and legs as he stood on a small stage, while at least four
other men raked the air with automatic weapons fire to spark panic
and allow the triggerman's escape.
   Galan, a 46-year-old senator and member of the center-left
Liberal Party, was popular and considered the front-runner in the
race for president in May 1990 elections. He repeatedly called for
eradication of the country's powerful cocaine cartels.
   His death capped two days of assassinations, including those of a
police colonel and a magistrate, that prompted President Virgilio
Barco to re-establish an extradition treaty with the United States,
where about 80 Colombians are wanted on drug charges.
   As part of the emergency crackdown on traffickers, police and
military forces have staged nearly 500 raids, seizing hundreds of
cars, trucks, small planes and helicopters and entire estates
allegedly owned by the drug lords.
   The Medellin cartel's alleged finance chief, Eduardo Martinez
Romero, was caught up in the sweep and police on Tuesday said they
had started the paperwork for his extradition to the United States,
where he is accused in a billion-dollar money laundering scheme.
   ``It's going to be a test case, when and if we get there,'' a
U.S. narcotics expert told reporters in Bogota.
   Thornburgh said in Washington that the United States was moving
to extradite Martinez even though his name was not on a list of the
``Dozen Most Wanted'' drug traffickers officials sent Tuesday to the
Colombian government. The list focused on the leaders of the
Medellin and Cali cartels.
   The narcotics expert, speaking on condition he not be identified,
described Martinez as ``a major figure'' in the Medellin cartel.
   Martinez was captured Sunday at Tolu, 550 miles north of Bogota.
He was being held under tight security at the headquarters of the
national police department's judicial investigations division.
   In an interview with a local reporter, Martinez said: ``At no
time have I had links to the Medellin cartel and I don't know any of
its members.''
   He would be the first alleged trafficker handed over by Colombia
since June 1987, when the Supreme Court declared the extradition
treaty with the United States unconstitional. Barco invoked
emergency powers under a 4-year-old state of seige to reinstate it
with provisions that eliminate judicial review.
   Drug traffickers are known to fear extradition to countries where
their power is limited. They have effectively intimidated the
Colombian courts by killing more than 220 judges and other
authorities involved in prosecution of drug cases.

<HEAD>Hong Kong to End Flogging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday it will abolish
flogging, a criminal punishment once widely used in Hong Kong during
the heydey of the British empire.
   The punishment _ in which a male offender is beaten a maximum of
18 times with a cane in the presence of a doctor _ has declined
markedly in this British colony. Hong Kong courts ordered only two
floggings this year, compared with 476 floggings in 1952.
   ``The decline in the use of corporal punishment as a sentencing
option to the point where it is now rarely used indicates clearly
that it cannot be regarded as an effective deterrent, and is clearly
not seen as such by the courts,'' the government said in a statement.
   Andrew Stables, former chairman of the local branch of Amnesty
International, described flogging as a remnant from the colonial era
that has ``no place in a modern society.''
   Only men can be flogged and ``the instrument used shall be a
light cane or rattan of a type approved by the governor,'' the
statutes say. The maximum number of strokes that can be applied are
18 for offenders aged 17 or older to six for offenders under 14
years.
   Offenses that can lead to flogging include indecent assault,
piracy, robbery and rape of a female younger than 16. Most recent
floggings have been for weapons possession convictions.
   Flogging was abolished in Britain four decades ago, and the
decision to end it in Hong Kong was in part because of sensitivity
to international criticism.
   The government noted that retaining flogging would ``have made
Hong Kong vulnerable to criticism from the United Nations Human
Rights Committee'' because the punishment contravened the 1966
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
   Although a public opinion survey found a large measure of support
for the punishment, there were more effective sentencing options,
the government said.
   The government said all legislation giving courts power to give
sentences of corporal punishment would be repealed, but it did not
give a timetable.

   A senior Communist Party official said corruption
within the party was largely to blame for the pro-democracy movement
and that the party should be purged of Western influences, official
reports said today.
   Also today, the Education Commission replaced the president of
Beijing University, whose students helped lead the movement that was
crushed in June.
   In another development, Anna Chennault, head of the Republican
Heritage Council, met with Vice President Wang Zhen. She said she
would report back to President Bush but declined comment on reports
she brought a message from him. Bush said today he had not asked her
to convey a messsage to the Chinese.
   Politburo member Song Ping said ideological deviations within the
47 million-member party were ``quite severe'' and called for a purge
of party leaders with ``bourgeois liberal,'' or Western, leanings,
the official People's Daily reported.
   Song, head of the Communist Party's Organization Department,
spoke on the opening day of a four-day meeting of the department,
which oversees discipline within the party. The meeting ended
Tuesday.
   Party corruption was a major theme of the pro-democracy protests,
and authorities have combined their suppression of the protest
movement with attacks on corrupt practices within the party.
   The China Daily quoted Xu Qing, deputy minister of supervision,
as saying the government is investigating 20 major corruption cases
and that several high-ranking officials were involved.
   Xu said results of the investigations will be reported about the
time of the 40th anniversary of Communist rule on Oct. 1.
   The People's Daily quoted Song as saying corruption within party
ranks was the main reason ``a small group of thugs could deceive and
instigate the people.'' He said such wrongdoings had ``killed the
confidence the people had in the party.''
   Song also condemned party members who supported student demands
for democratic reforms.
   ``A small number of party members from several major research
institutes played a disgusting role by running around on sinister
errands and stirring up trouble,'' the official Xinhua News Agency
quoted Song as saying.
   Song said the party must stand behind the decisions made in June
during a Central Committee meeting at which reformist Zhao Ziyang
was ousted as party chief for expressing sympathy for the protesters.
   The Communist Party periodically launches campaigns against
corruption, but in the past has had little success in reducing the
influence peddling, extortion, bribery, hoarding of goods and
illegal use of public funds rampant among middle- and lower-level
party and government officials.
   Beijing University leader Ding Shisun was the second university
president replaced since the protests. The official Xinhua portrayed
the move as non-political and said the 62-year-old Ding had asked as
early as February to leave for ``health and other reasons.''
   However, school officials within the past month said repeatedly
that Ding had no plans to leave. When contacted by telephone as
recently as Monday, they said Ding remained president and made no
mention of a planned change.
   Ding was replaced with 56-year-old Wu Shuqing. Wu had been vice
president of People's University, whose students also took part in
the protests.
   Students from Beijing University, considered China's most
prestigious school, took the lead in the protests as they
traditionally have in past political movements.
   Ding maintained a low profile during the protests, speaking out
only to urge a speedy solution to the problem. But he also did
nothing to stop his students, while other schools put heavy pressure
on their students to stop protesting and some even locked their
campus gates before major marches.
   Xinhua claimed that Mrs. Chennault today told Wang that the
military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement was China's
internal affair and no foreign country should interefere.
   Mrs. Chennault, contacted by telephone, laughed when the Xinhua
dispatch was read to her. However, she declined to say if it was
accurate.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed civilians were killed
when troops swept across the city on June 3-4. Bush and many other
foreign leaders condemned Chinese authorities for the crackdown.
   Mrs. Chennault, widow of World War II ``Flying Tiger'' founder
Gen. Claire Lee Channault, arrived in Beijing on Thursday.
   She was tight-lipped about her visit, saying only that she had
``met important people'' and had ``constructive discussion'' with
leaders.
   Asked about her visit, Bush today told reporters in Maine, where
he is vacationing: ``I did not ask her to convey any message to the
Chinese. We have our own diplomatic avenues through which to do
that.''

<HEAD>Romania Marks National Day With Military Parade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania held its first military parade in
five years Wednesday, the 45th anniversary of the day an anti-Nazi
alliance overthrew the fascist government and switched sides in
World War II.
   There was no word on whether National Day also was marked, as
expected, by the opening of a massive white marble building from
which President Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, plan to rule
the communist nation. It is officially called the Palace of the
People, and popularly known as the Marxist White House.
   The parade and rally was held for the first time in a new square
outside the Museum of National History, described by the official
news agency Agerpres as ``a monumental edifice in an advanced
building stage.'' The square is near the Civic Center, a huge
housing project also near completion.
   Agerpres said 200,000 people filed past Ceausescu and other high
officials in the parade. Workers, folk dancers and athletes joined
the soldiers, tanks, mobile missiles and amphibious vehicles, and
Romanian-built jet fighters flew overhead, the agency reported.
   No reason was given for the military parade. Romania dropped such
martial displays after the the Helsinki agreements on European
security and cooperation were signed in 1975, except for a parade in
1984, the 50th anniversary of the anti-fascist coup.
   On Aug. 23, 1944, a broad coalition headed by King Michael
overthrew Marshal Ion Antonescu and put Romania on the side of the
Allies. In December 1947, the Communist Party assisted by Moscow
forced Michael out.
   Rumors have circulated in Bucharest for some time that the Palace
of the People, which includes state and party offices and is topped
by triangular metal flagpole, would be inaugurated on National Day.
   The new Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, lined with new
apartment buildings still uninhabited, cuts a three-mile path
through the heart of what once was lively Old Bucharest.
   Ceausecu, Romania's leader since 1965, conceived the palace,
which has nuclear-proof bunkers, and the avenue. Hundreds of private
homes and at least 20 churches were demolished to make room for the
project, which began in 1984.
   Foreign diplomats in Bucharest say Ceausescu has tried to
transform Romania from a backward, agricultural society into an
industrialized nation like the one Stalin tried to build in the
Soviet Union, using similar methods.

<HEAD>Court Closes Hearing In CIA Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals panel today closed a
hearing in the Iran-Contra criminal case against former CIA Station
Chief Joseph Fernandez because of concerns about national security.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
closed the hearing after Edward Dennis, acting deputy attorney
general, said the court would be hearing information relating to
national security.
   Timothy Dyk, an attorney for several media outlets, objected to
the closing on constitutional grounds. However, the court ruled that
the matter was not subject to debate because of the verbal
certification by Dennis.
   Fernandez is accused of lying to investigators about his
assistance to Oliver North's Contra network. He is charged with two
counts of obstruction and two counts of making false statements to
the CIA inspector general's office and the Tower Commission in 1987.
   The court also heard arguments on whether the Justice Department
has standing to intervene in the case over the objections of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. However, no decision was
immediately made on that issue.
   Walsh's office has objected to the Justice Department taking
legal questions concerning classified information in the Fernandez
case to the appeals court. The independent counsel says the Justice
Department's action in effect would take control of the case from
Walsh's office.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va., ruled
last month that Fernandez is entitled to disclose as part of his
defense the locations of several CIA facilities and details of
secret CIA programs.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Calls On Morocco To Help Hunger Strikers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International appealed Wednesday to the
Moroccan government to give medical aid to three political prisoners
who the human rights group said are in critical condition after a
two-month hunger strike.
   Four political prisoners began a hunger strike June 17 to protest
conditions at Rabat's Laalou Prison, Amnesty International said.
   One of the prisoners, Chbada Abdelhaq, 28, died Saturday in
Rabat's Avicennes Hospital, the group said.
   Alami Bouti Hassan, Benabdessalam Abdelllah and Boukourou
Abdelfattah, all serving eight-year sentences for belonging to an
illegal left-wing organization, are comatose at the hospital,
Amnesty International said.
   Amnesty International said other prisoners have been waging
hunger strikes since 1986. The most recent series began in April
after incidents in which prisoners reportedly were ill-treated, it
said.
   ``Abdelhaq is reported to have been left chained to the floor of
a small, windowless isolation cell for a week, bleeding from the
nose, with no medical attention, toilet facilities or possibility of
moving from the ring to which he was chained,'' Amnesty
International said.
   ``The prisoners reacted by declaring a hunger strike which lasted
21 days and ended in May when the prison director apparently
promised improvements in their conditions of detention,'' Amnesty
International said.
   The hunger strike was resumed June 17 when improvements had not
been implemented, it said.
   Amnesty International urged Moroccan authorities to ``ensure that
the prisoners receive all the medical assistance they require and be
allowed regular visits by their families.''
   ``It is also urging that the conditions of treatment of prisoners
in Laalou Prison be investigated and any form of cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment ended,'' the statement said.

   Thousands of Baltic residents linked
hands in a giant human chain and lighted candles at the dusk today
to mourn their loss of independence a half-century ago to Josef
Stalin's tanks.
   Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians took up spots on a 370-mile
route from the Gulf of Finland to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius,
to demand that Moscow recognize it forcibly annexed their countries
and grant them greater independence.
   In Vilnius, 5,000 people gathered in Cathedral Square, singing
the national anthem of independent Lithuania and holding candles to
commemmorate Stalin's victims.
   Grazina Staniute, a 15-year-old student from Kaunas, said the
candles ``symbolize those who died in exile. When we light the
candles, they will be with us.''
   Brone Surzilate, 58, who was one of those exiled by Stalin, held
a card with the number 1,222,660 written on it. That is the number
of Lithuanians that activists say have suffered repression in 50
years of Soviet rule.
   Organizers said they expected 1.5 million people to link hands
along the route in a show of solidarity. There was no way to
determine immediately whether there were gaps in the line, or how
many people took part.
   The chain was to climax a series of protests marking the
anniversary of the Aug. 23, 1939, non-aggression treaty between the
Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which led to the Soviet annexation of
the Baltic republics the next year.
   Eight days after the signing, Adolf Hitler attacked Poland and
started World War II.
   About 50,000 people gathered Tuesday in Vilnius to mourn the
Soviet takeover. Hundreds gathered again today with signs denouncing
the Soviet Union as imperialist and paraded effigies of Hitler and
Stalin.
   Leaders of the Lithuanian People's Front activist group in
Vilnius today approved their most explicit demand for independence.
About 170 leaders of the group voted to call for ``the creation of
an independent democratic Lithuanian republic not under the power of
the Soviet Union.''
   The vote followed criticism today in the Communist Party daily
Pravda, which accused People's Front leaders of distorting history
and seeking full secession from the Soviet Union.
   Activists Tuesday in Riga, Latvia, demanded that Moscow and the
world recognize the absorption of the Baltic lands by the Soviet
Union was a crime carried out by Stalin and Hitler.
   In the Estonian capital, Tallinn, announcements today on the
official radio told participants how to get to their spots on the
human chain, and organizers scheduled news conferences, meetings and
concerts.
   ``The Estonian people are very united and the mood is very
good,'' said Ulo Kaevats, a member of the Estonian People's Front,
one of the grass-roots groups that organized the event. The protests
``are dedicated to victory over the evil that the pact and the
Soviet occupation begat,'' he said.
   Events marking the pact also were scheduled in other regions of
the western Soviet Union that were absorbed under the secret pact.
Yuri Rozhgo, a spokesman for the People's Front of Moldavia, said a
rally would be held to condemn the agreement.
   Moldavia was part of Romania before World War II, but Soviet
soldiers occupied it in 1940 and it became one of the 15 Soviet
republics.
   In a secret protocol to the treaty, Hitler and Stalin divided
Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. The small, independent
Baltic republics fell into Soviet hands and were a battleground
before Germany's defeat in the war.
   Thousands of Baltic residents were shot or deported for their
anti-Soviet sympathies, and after the war others were similarly
punished for real or alleged collaboration with the Nazis.
   ``The Soviet Union has done everything to remove the republics of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the memory and the map of Europe,
from your libraries and textbooks, your sense of justice, your grief
and your minds,'' the People's Front organizations in the three
republics said Tuesday in a statement.
   A commission of Lithuania's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, said
in a report published Tuesday that the Soviet Union's annexation of
Lithuania was an ``international crime.
   ``Elimination of the consequences is not only an internal matter
of the U.S.S.R., but a matter for Europe and the entire society of
world governments,'' it said.
   A two-day conference of Eastern European activists in Riga called
for the United Nations to take up the Baltic republics' status.

   Multimillionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes' 70th
birthday party in Morocco forced a bunch of American tourists to
spend two nights in what they called ``seedy, crummy'' hotels.
   Forbes had secured plenty of first-class hotel accommodations in
Tangiers, Morocco, for his guests, but due to unexpected renovations
on some of those rooms, 33 other vacationers were bumped.
   ``We were a little upset in Tangiers because of Malcolm,'' Senta
Rodoff of New York City told New York Newsday.
   Forbes invited about 600 guests to the weekend party that was
estimated to have cost $2 million.
   Members of the vacation group were told King Hassan II ordered
the change in reservations.
   The group spent two nights in second-class accommodations, the
second night in a hotel that was in a neighborhood they deemed so
dangerous they feared to leave the building at night.
   Harlan Coben, senior vice president of Club ABC Tours of Union,
N.J., said he was unaware that the group was forced out of its
reservations.
   ``We had this trip planned for months and months and then we were
put in a seedy, crummy hotel,'' said Beverly Levy of Rochester.

   A group of store owners in the suburban San
Fernando Valley hopes to curb candy before school and swigging beer
out of brown paper bags.
   Twenty liquor store owners and two grocery store owners announced
Tuesday they have agreed to abide by some self-imposed guidelines
aimed at combatting drug- and alcohol-related crime in their
neighborhood.
   ``We have to control the alcohol sales in the community,'' said
Fred Taylor, owner of a religious bookstore and chairman of the San
Fernando Valley Community Advisory Board. ``And to do that, we have
to cooperate with the liquor stores.''
   His group and the Merchants for a Better Community came up with
the rules, which include:
   _No alcohol sales after 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday or after
midnight Friday and Saturday.
   _No more sales of so-called short dogs, which are small, cheap
bottles of wine, or single cans of beer.
   _All alcoholic beverages will be sold in clear plastic bags so
the buyer can't stand on a street corner and swig. ``If he does, the
police will see him,'' reasoned grocery and liquor store owner
Samuel Rose.
   _No sales of papers that can be used to roll marijuana cigarettes.
   _No sales of balloons, which can be used to store heroin.
   _No sales of candy from 8 to 10 a.m. on weekdays because
merchants say it contributes to the cycle of addiction among
children.
   ``The kids get high on sugar before they get to school,'' Taylor
said. ``When they're hyper, it's a problem for the teachers.''
   The store owners also promised to clear graffiti and litter from
their businesses, boot out drug dealers who hang around and remove
pay phones that can be used to make drug deals.
   Rose said the actions shouldn't cost the stores more.
   ``You're going to make more money,'' he said. ``Now more families
will come in.''

   A pilot charged with resisting
arrest after flying in restricted airspace over Ronald Reagan's home
last year was found innocent.
   A Municipal Court jury on Tuesday acquitted Douglas Davis of the
misdemeanor charge.
   ``I just feel super, great. It feels good to be a free man
again,'' said Davis, 44.
   Davis' attorney, Scott Raphael, said the decision bolsters his
client's $1 million civil suit, which contends that an Orange County
sheriff's deputy used excessive force against him while he was
detained for questioning by federal agents.
   ``It was a tough case. I could see where the jury might have
found a reasonable doubt about his guilt,'' said Deputy District
Attorney David Frank, who prosecuted the case.
   The Federal Aviation Administration forced Davis to land after he
flew over the former president's home last Dec. 28. FAA rules
prohibited low-level flights over the area when Reagan was at his
Bel-Air home.
   Davis, a part-time pilot for a map-maker, said he was not
informed the restriction applied that day.

<HEAD>Gov't Presents Budget, Braces for Battle with Socialists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denmark's shaky minority government
Wednesday presented its draft budget for 1990, signaling a likely
confrontation with the socialist opposition.
   The center-right Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
commands only 67 of the 179 seats in parliament and needs to find
shifting majorities to pass legislation. Moreover, the coalition
comprising Schlueter's Conservatives, the Liberals and Social
Liberals shows signs of internal strife.
   Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said the budget proposal
reflected a major economic plan the government hopes to enact this
year.
   The plan, unveiled in May, called for a cut in the corporate
income tax rate from 50 percent to 35 percent, the top marginal
income tax from 68 percent to 52 percent and capital gains from 57
percent to 40 percent.
   It also proposed gradual reductions in public spending and
employment.
   The tax reforms would be financed by introducing user charges for
the state's largely free social services and by shifting a greater
share of the unemployment benefit system onto employers and labor
organizations.
   The Social Democrats, Denmark's biggest political party with 55
seats in parliament, put forward a tax reform of their own.
   It also called for big tax cuts, but not at the expense of
welfare benefits and employment. Instead, the Social Democrats
proposed an obligatory pension savings plan, the proceeds of which
would be reinvested in industry through union-run investment funds.
   The government has begun negotiations with the Social Democrats
to reach a compromise and avoid a showdown that could mean an early
election.
   In a recent opinion poll published in the financial daily
newspaper Boersen, the Social Democrats and their allies, the
Socialist People's Party, would have a slight majority if elections
were called now.
   The ruling Conservatives did poorly both in the 1988 election and
in a recent direct vote for the European Parliament. They face a
real political test in local elections scheduled in November.
   Danes have gone to the polls twice since 1987, but each time the
result was no clear majority in parliament.
   In his proposal, Simonsen forecast total net state expenditures
of $37.3 billion in 1990 with a budget deficit of $373.3 million.
   The party's reaction to the budget, which included a $1.06
billion cut in public spending, was to reject it unless the
government dropped the proposed welfare cuts.
   But Schlueter demanded the Social Democrats accept the budget as
a condition for the government's continuing to bargain with the
opposition on tax and economic reforms.
   Parliament will vote on the budget in December, and the
government hopes to have made a deal with the Social Democrats by
then. Otherwise, Schlueter might be forced to seek support from the
rightist Progress Party and other minor non-socialist parties or to
call an election that he likely would lose.

   The Justice Department, eager to bring
Colombian drug dealers to trial in the United States, is issuing a
``most wanted'' list of the top 12, and President Bush today said
such extraditions should go forward.
   A U.S. government plane has been in Colombia since the weekend,
an administration source said today, but there's no indication that
it will be used to transport anybody who might be extradited to the
United States.
   The list released Tuesday includes a dozen alleged top drug
traffickers, including leaders of the two major Colombian cocaine
cartels and a former Colombian police officer who officials say
tried to kill two U.S. agents.
   ``We don't know the whereabouts of any of these individuals,''
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said, noting that the government is
enlisting the aid of the Colombian government and Interpol to bring
them to justice here.
   The Interpol network of worldwide law enforcement agencies was
alerted ``in recognition of the possibility that (the suspects) may
have already fled Colombia'' because of the recent crackdown on drug
traffickers there, Thornburgh said.
   Asked today on ``CBS This Morning'' why the Colombian drug lords
should not be tried in their own country, Thornburgh said:
   ``In an ideal world they would be. But as we've seen, the tragic
events there that have involved the assassination of judges, law
enforcement officials, even a presidential candidate over the
weekend, have really robbed (Colombian officials) of the ability to
enforce their own laws.''
   About 80 alleged Colombian drug traffickers have been indicted in
the United States, but their cases have languished since the
Colombian Supreme Court overturned its extradition treaty with the
United States in 1987.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco, prompted by last week's
assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan,
instituted emergency measures to allow the immediate resumption of
extraditions.
   Galan was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers.
   Bush, at a news conferenece in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he is
on vacation, praised Barco's efforts, saying, ``I have great respect
for what President Barco is trying to do. I am convinced he is
determined to whip the problem, to beat it.''
   The process of extraditing drug trafficking suspects to the
United States ``should go forward,'' Bush said.
   The ``most wanted'' list does not include the one alleged
Medellin cartel money-launderer who was arrested over the weekend in
Colombia, Eduardo Martinez Romero.
   ``We are taking steps to provide the necessary documentation to
secure his extradition to the United States,'' Thornburgh said.
   An administration source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said today that a U.S. government plane has been in Colombia since
last weekend, but its purpose there was unclear.
   It could be used to transport Martinez back to the United States,
the source said, but there is no indication that it will be used for
that purpose.
   A source at the international airport in Bogota identified the
plane as belonging to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, but
DEA officials in Washington declined comment.
   The Marshals Service usually transports those being extradited to
the United States, and it has its own fleet of two 727s and ``a
dozen or more smaller aircraft'' that can be used for such work,
said service spokesman Bill Dempsey.
   ``We haven't been brought into the picture yet'' on the Martinez
case, Dempsey said.
   On Tuesday, Thornburgh's chief of staff, Robert Ross, said it was
not clear how long the extradition of Martinez might take.
   ``The quickest thing that could happen is they could put somebody
on a plane and deliver him to the United States, or they could
engage in some other process which could well involve us supplying
different kinds of documentation which traditionally is what happens
under extradition treaties,'' Ross said. ``Whether they're going to
operate that way or not, we don't know.''
   The attorney general said the United States should not bow to
fears that it might become targeted by the violence that has plagued
Colombia, where dozens of judges and hundreds of law enforcement
officers have been killed by drug traffickers.
   ``We can't succumb in this country to what has already brought
the criminal justice system to its knees in Colombia,'' he said.
   ``They are rising from their knees, they are standing up to these
drug traffickers and they deserve every bit of support that we can
give them, and that support will be forthcoming.''
   Those on the ``Dozen Most Wanted'' are:
   _The three reputed Medellin cartel leaders: Pablo Emilio Escobar
Gaviria, 39, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, 40, and Jose Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, 42.
   _Two of Ochoa Vasquez's brothers, Fabio, 32, and Juan David, 41,
along with Gustavo de Jesus Gaviria Rivero, 42, and Gerardo Moncada,
42. All are alleged members of the Medellin cartel.
   _Jose Ivan Duarte Acero, 37, a former police officer alleged to
work with the Medellin cartel. Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman Con Dougherty said Acero was the gunman responsible ``for
the attempted murder of two of our agents down there.''
   _The reputed leaders of the Cali cartel: Gilberto Jose Rodriguez
Orjuela, 50; Miguel Angel Rodriguez Orjuela, 45; and Jose Santacruz
Londono, 45. Also on the list is alleged Cali cartel member Jamie
Raul Orjuela Caballero, 46.

<HEAD>Libel Awards Less Costly in 1987-88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The media won 40 percent of the libel cases tried
to conclusion in 1987 and 1988, the Libel Defense Resource Center
reported.
   That compares to a 24 percent win rate in 1985 and 1986, said the
center, a non-profit information clearinghouse organized by media
groups.
   But Henry R. Kaufman, the center's general counsel, said it was
important not to overstate the trend.
   ``Despite the recent slight improvement in trial success, the
media's overall trial win rate during the eight years since 1980
remains at only 28 percent ... still an unacceptably poor showing,''
Kaufman said in the report released Tuesday.
   The center also found that large libel awards against the media
dropped in 1987 and 1988. The average amount of damages initially
awarded was $431,730 in that period _ down from $1.167 million in
the previous period.
   ``Although lower in relative terms, an average damage award
approaching $500,000, in cases that rarely involve significant
out-of-pocket loss, remains in absolute terms an unacceptably high
tariff on free expression,'' said Kaufman.
   There were no awards of more than $10 million during the latest
two-year period. In comparison, from 1980 through 1986, each of the
two-year periods had one or two eight-figure awards.
   ``The absence of any outrageously inflated, eight-figure
mega-awards during this period is a most welcome development,'' said
Kaufman. But he said it was impossible to predict whether fewer huge
awards is an aberration or whether it will become a trend.
   In addition, 14 percent of the damage awards in 1987 and 1988
exceeded $1 million. In the prior two years, 27 percent did. From
1980 through 1986, 25 percent of all awards against the media were
more than $1 million.
   And considering cases where the initial award was under $1
million _ about three-quarters of the total _ the average award was
$250,518 in 1987 and 1988. That's $11,589 more than in the previous
period, and the highest of any period studied since 1980.

<TEXT>
   Voyager 2, only a day away from its close
encounter with Neptune, was ready for new computer commands today as
it searched for more moons and rings after discovering a first
complete ring around the storm-wracked planet.
   A new picture taken by Voyager shows what appears to be a large
meteorite crater on Triton, Neptune's major moon, deputy project
scientist Ellis Miner said today.
   Howewver, he said, there also are uncratered regions on the moon,
and scientists haven't yet definitely concluded the spot on the
still-fuzzy Triton picture is an impact crater.
   Engineers prepared to send Voyager the computer program this
afternoon to control how the spacecraft aims itself, its cameras and
other sensors during its flight past Neptune and Triton, said Doug
Griffith, deputy mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest navigation information shows that after a 12-year,
4.4-billion-mile flight, Voyager will be within one second and 22
miles of where it is supposed to be for the Neptune flyby, he said.
   ``The spacecraft is working marvelously, with no problems at
all,'' Griffith said.
   He said the new computer program, smaller than that contained in
many popular computer games, is crucial to experiments in which
Voyager will study the makeup of the atmospheres of Neptune and
Triton by sending radio waves through their atmospheres to Earth.
   Griffith said the new navigation data shows Voyager will make its
closest approach by flying 3,000 miles above Neptune's cloudtops at
18 seconds before 8:56 p.m. PDT Thursday.
   Until today's search for more moons, ``suspects have been seen
here and there,'' said Bradford Smith, a University of Arizona
planetary scientist who heads Voyager's photographic imaging team.
``I would expect several more satellites.''
   So far, Voyager has found four small moons besides Nereid and
backward-orbiting Triton, which were first seen years ago from Earth.
   After Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune, the probe
may find a sheet of ring material encircling the planet _ similar to
the broad band of dust it discovered around Uranus in 1986,
laboratory astronomer Rich Terrile said.
   Smith announced Tuesday the spacecraft found at least one
complete ring of diffuse debris orbiting Neptune. He said a partial
ring discovered by the spacecraft almost two weeks ago also may
prove to be a second complete ring. It has parts that are thicker
than other parts.
   Tuesday's find, the latest in a string of discoveries by the
probe during passes by Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus,
elated scientists.
   ``I like the idea Voyager is going out with a bang. It's going to
blow our minds,'' said Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist with the
University of Arizona, Tucson.
   Pictures taken by Voyager on Aug. 11 revealed two partial rings _
or ring arcs _ extending around Neptune. One of them couldn't be
found in later images and was dubbed the ``lost arc,'' until Voyager
relocated it Tuesday and found it goes all the way around the planet.
   Finding a complete ring was surprising. Voyager project scientist
Edward Stone said two months ago the planet might be orbited by 50
to 100 ring arcs, but he backed away from that Tuesday.
   About 9 o'clock PDT tonight, Voyager will cross within 1 million
miles of Neptune, speeding toward the giant gaseous planet at 38,047
mph. It will be about 2.75 billion miles from Earth, having traveled
a curving path of 4.4 billion miles since it was launched in 1977.
   At 2:10 a.m. Friday, Voyager will zip within 24,000 miles of the
moon Triton.
   Vice President Dan Quayle is scheduled to visit the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory several hours later to congratulate Voyager
scientists and engineers.
   Voyager was programmed to search today for more rings and arcs _
including any that might be in or near Triton's orbit _ and to look
for ``shepherd moons.'' Rings get their shape from the pull of
gravity between a planet and its moons, so moons that corral rings
are called shepherd moons.
   Today's picture-snapping schedule also included 30 images of
Triton, four photos of one of the moons Voyager discovered, and 22
pictures of Neptune and its surprisingly turbulent weather, with
racing clouds and an Earth-sized cyclone.
   Because of its bluish color and bright clouds, ``Neptune looks
Earthlike,'' Porco said. ``With clouds floating in the atmosphere,
it looks homey.''
   The space probe also was to measure temperatures at various
altitudes in Neptune's atmosphere.
   Some scientists have said arcs and rings could be the remnants of
moons torn apart by gravitational forces, but Porco said it was more
likely some of them form when moons collide.
   ``We've now seen four different ring systems at four different
planets,'' Terrile said, citing Saturns vast system of broad rings,
Jupiter's single narrow ring, and Uranus' 10 thin rings and one
broad sheet of dust that seems to contain dozens of rings.
   ``I find it intriguing to think that in coming to all these
planets, we're seeing ring systems at different stages of
evolution,'' Porco said. ``They have complexity in common. Each
planet is so damn different than the next.''
   The existence of moons and rings around planets in our solar
system suggests ``the processes that formed the Earth are common,''
bolstering the belief that planets orbit stars other than the sun,
Terrile said.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers forced their way into a Gaza
City hospital Wednesday while pursuing stone-throwing Palestinians,
and a hospital official said troops abused medical staff and
terrorized patients.
   About 30 soldiers seized four Palestinians at the hospital but
subsequently released them, the official said. Hospital workers
staged a sit-down strike to protest the raid, she said.
   The army said soldiers entered the hospital because they were
pelted with stones from the facility's grounds.
   Also Wednesday, police rounded up 170 Arab laborers from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip who were caught spending the night
in Israel, a violation of rules requiring them to return home after
work, Israel radio said.
   The laborers later were released, the radio said. Most of the
arrests took place in the Galilee region in the north and the
coastal towns of Akko and Nahariya, police said.
   Many Arabs customarily ignore the rule to avoid the long daily
commutes back to the occupied territories, or to avoid participating
in strikes called by underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising.
   The arrests follows regulations instituted Friday that require
Palestinians to have special computerized identity cards to enter
Israel from the Gaza Strip.
   Palestinians say the cards are aimed at trying to defuse the
20-month-old uprising against Israeli rule, but government officials
maintain the system is meant to block ``potential offenders'' from
entering Israel following attacks on Jewish civilians.
   Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain during the uprising. At
least 545 Palestinians also have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
settlers, and 97 others have been killed by fellow Arabs, often
after allegations they collaborated with security forces.
   On Wednesday, a Scottish doctor performed an autopsy on the body
of 14-year-old Amjad Jibril Tawil, a Palestinian-American whose body
was found with a single bullet wound last week in the West Bank town
of El-Bireh.
   The independent autopsy, by Dr. Derick Pounder, was requested by
the family, which alleged the boy was in army custody before his
death. Pounder represents the Boston-based Physicians for Human
Rights. Tawil was born in Denver.
   The army said the government's own autopsy cleared soldiers of
involvement.
   The incident at Ahli Arab Hospital began when soldiers forced
their way onto the hospital grounds behind an ambulance, said a
hospital official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They (the soldiers) treated our staff in a bad way, especially
in the emergency room, hitting people with their rifle butts and
pushing them with their hands,'' the official said.
   She said soldiers ran through the wards, including the children's
wing, ``scaring them terribly.''
   The official said soldiers detained four Palestinians who had
been doing construction work with stones and cement at the adjacent
nursing school, run by the American Baptist Mission. The four later
were freed, she said.
   The army said in a statement that ``after people threw stones
from the yard of the hospital, Israeli forces entered the hospital
to catch the stone throwers and caught four.'' It gave no other
details.
   Hospital officials denied stones were thrown from the hospital
grounds.
   Hospital staff staged a three-hour sit-down strike to protest the
raid. The hospital official said the Anglican Church, which runs the
hospital, was notified and complaints were filed with U.S. British
and Danish embassies.
   ``We are aware of the incident and we are checking with the
proper authorities,'' said a U.S. Embassy official who asked not to
be identified.

   An unarmed Algerian emigre took control
of an Air France airliner flying from Paris to Algiers with 115
people aboard today, but he was arrested when the plane landed at
Algiers airport, officials said.
   The pilot said the hijacker had held something under his jacket
and threatened to blow up the plane. But, as the hijacker told
reporters before being led away, all he had was a piece of soap and
a perfume spray bottle.
   The pilot said he landed in Algiers after other airports in
Algeria and Tunisia refused permission to land there. It was not
immediately clear if the hijacker had demanded to be flown to those
destinations.
   The hijacker, who apparently surrendered, said he commandeered
the plane to call attention ``to the need to end violence in Lebanon
and Palestine.''
   News reports in Paris said he was being expelled from France to
his homeland when he hijacked the Airbus A300.
   An Air France spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the hijacking ended at 3:25 p.m. (10:25 a.m. EDT), barely an
hour after the plane landed at Houari Boumedienne airport east of
the Algerian capital. She said the 102 passengers and 13 members of
the crew were all safe. The spokeswoman said she could not give
details of how the hijacking was ended.
   Algerian police identified the hijacker as Said Djamel, alias
Bendada, and said he was a 30-year-old merchant in Paris.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified
sources in Paris, said the man was being expelled for ``violating
public order'' and that he ``displayed great agitation'' before
being put on the flight to Algiers.
   The plane's pilot, Joseph Valat, said in a brief statement that
he landed at Houari Boumedienne airport after airports in Tunis,
Tunisia, and in Annaba and Constantine in Algeria refused permission
to land there.
   The hijacker called for ``the holding of an international
conference on Lebanon, the opening of a dialogue between the PLO and
Israel and the liberation of all hostages and prisoners in the
region.''
   He showed reporters a small piece of soap and a perfume bottle
which he identified as his only ``weapons.''
   Initial reports from French air traffic control sources had said
the flight of the Airbus from Paris to Algiers had been diverted
toward Tunisia.
   Earlier incorrect reports had said that 130 and 123 people were
aboard.
   Agence France-Presse said Air France Flight 2323, took off from
Orly airport in Paris.
   The hijacking came amid heightened tensions between France and
Moslem forces fighting in Lebanon. The Syrian forces and their
allied Moslem militias recently said they would shell French
warships gathering in the eastern Mediterranean if they intervened
militarily in Lebanon.
   France said the warships were dispatched to evacuate 7,000 French
nationals in Lebanon if the 5-month-old battle between Moslem and
Christian forces worsens. But the Moslems accuse the French of
backing the Christians.

<TEXT>
   An Exxon employee whose 314-pound
halibut is likely to win the Homer Jackpot Derby wants to withdraw
from the contest and give up her chance at the $10,000 first prize.
   Dorothy Porter of Rahway, N.J., told the Homer Chamber of
Commerce she has been harassed, apparently because of her
association with Exxon and the nation's worst oil spill.
   Porter is on leave until Aug. 30 from her job at Exxon's spill
response office in Homer. Some of the 11 million gallons of oil
spilled March 24 by the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound washed
ashore at Homer.
   ``I talked to her for half an hour and tried to talk her out of
it,'' said Beverly Wood, who manages the visitors' center operated
by the chamber, which runs the annual fishing derby.
   But Wood said Porter was upset, and insisted on removing her
photograph from a derby display and reclaimed her entry form.
   ``She said she got a lot of harassment and calls and conflict on
it,'' Woods said. ``She said she mulled it over for days on end
before making that decision.''
   Porter, who had never been fishing before, caught the monster
flatfish on Aug. 6 from a charter boat in Cook Inlet. She withdrew a
few days later.
   Wood said Porter told her she had worked for Exxon for 16 years
and did not want to cause the company problems.
   Reached by phone at her home Tuesday by the Anchorage Daily News,
Porter refused to discuss the matter. ``I don't wish to make a
comment. Thank you. Good-bye,'' she said and hung up.
   The company did not ask her to withdraw from the derby, an Exxon
spokesman said.
   ``This was a private, off-the-job, non-Exxon decision she made,''
said Fred Davis, a public information official at the company's
cleanup headquarters in Valdez.
   The second-place fish so far in the contest that ends Labor Day
is a 247-pounder caught by an Anchor Point woman.

<TEXT>
   The fire chief has banned nightly volleyball
games at the fire station because he says game injuries kept two men
from work.
   But the firefighters say the games boost morale and keep them fit.
   ``It may look bad when people drive by, but volleyball helps to
improve athletic ability and coordination,'' said Paul Ostman, a
fire equipment operator and regular volleyball player.
   ``It helps us have the agility to do other things on the job. We
wear an extra 30, 40 pounds of equipment. Volleyball helps
strengthen muscles we need to move under those conditions.''
   For decades, firefighters have played volleyball in the evening
during 24-hour shifts when their regular duties were done and they
were on standby.
   But Chief Larry Bushey ordered the ban after two firefighters
sprained ankles in a game and missed work for a few days.
   ``Our only intention is to keep our fire units in service,''
Bushey said. ``I know they complain they can go out and get injured
at the fire scene. We have no control over that, but we do have
control over who gets injured playing volleyball.''
   Other recreational equipment is provided at the fire halls, and
the city also will pay for health club memberships, Bushey said.
   A union grievance on the issue was delivered to Kjell Rodne, city
personnel director, on Tuesday, said Jim Lane, president of Duluth
Firefighters Local 101.

<TEXT>
   Israel's minister of religious affairs and
a Roman Catholic cardinal did not resolve the dispute over a convent
at the Auschwitz concentration camp, the chief Israeli diplomat to
Poland said Wednesday.
   Zevulun Hammer, the first Israeli minister to make an official
visit to Poland since diplomatic relations were severed 22 years
ago, on Tuesday asked Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow to
move the convent according to a 1987 agreement.
   The cardinal said, however, there was no immediate plan to
transfer the nuns, said Mordechai Palzur, head of Israel's interest
section in Poland.
   ``They are not moving for the time being and when it can happen
is unclear,'' he said. ``He did not say it was a closed matter, but
it is not a matter of days or weeks or even months.''
   Jewish groups and others have protested the convent as a
intrusion of Christian symbols at the place built by the Nazis
mainly to exterminate Jews. An estimated 4 million people, at least
2.5 million of them Jews, were murdered at the death camp complex.
   Hammer, who lost members of his family at Auschwitz, visited the
camp for the first time before meeting with Macharski in nearby
Krakow.
   Macharski said this month that the convent, housed in a former
Nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp, would not be moved as
had been promised in an international accord reached by Jewish and
Catholic leaders in Geneva.
   Catholic leaders had agreed to move the Carmelite nuns by Feb. 22
to an interfaith prayer center farther from the camp. Protests
increased after the deadline passed, including one July 14 when an
American rabbi and six students were roughly removed from the
convent. Macharski then said the agreement would not be honored in
an ``atmosphere of aggressive demands.''
   The cardinal said the protests had created opposition to moving
the convent, particularly among residents of the town in southern
Poland where the death camp is located.
   Macharski told the Israeli delegation that he had intended to
move the convent when the agreement was reached, ``but now was not
in a position to go ahead with the plan,'' Palzur said.
   Palzur said he assured the cardinal he would be available to help
in any way needed to mediate the situation but noted he had no
control over those who might protests at the convent.

<HEAD>Sudan Extending Cease-Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The military government will extend for
another month its unilateral cease-fire in the country's 6-year-old
civil war, a senior officer was quoting as saying Wednesday.
   Brig. Dominic Kasiano told the Armed Forces newspaper the
extension demonstrates the government's good will toward the rebels
even though the two sides failed to reach an agreement in their
first round of peace talks over the weekend.
   He said the cease-fire was being extended to the end of September.
   The country's military rulers, led by Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, deposed a civilian government in a coup in June and
pledged to promote peace efforts.
   Kasiano, a member of the 15-member ruling council, said the
government ``has shown good intent of seeking to halt the bloodshed
and find a durable and comprehensive solution to the question of
southern Sudan,'' according to the newspaper.
   The rebels of this East African nation took up arms in 1983,
demanding greater autonomy for the southern region.
   Fighting has ceased almost completely since April, when the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army declared a unilateral cease-fire to
allow a U.N. relief operation to distribute food to starving
Sudanese in the south. The rebels later extended their cease-fire
until the end of June.
   El-Bashir's government, in turn, ordered a cease-fire during July
and then extended it until the end of this month.
   The two sides are expected to resume their peace talks, but no
date has been set.

   He was a small Irish kid who always sat
next to the teacher. Dressed well. Left Elizabeth for the big city
and made a name for himself.
   The old town now is putting that name on a sign.
   Mickey Spillane, the best-selling detective story writer who
created the Mike Hammer novels, had a street named in his honor
Tuesday by the City Council.
   Spillane, 71, was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn
and now lives in South Carolina, but spent most of his boyhood in
Elizabeth.
   Walter Milos, a classmate from Theodore Roosevelt Junior High
School's class of 1932, remembers Spillane as a sharp dresser and
good student.
   ``I was his bodyguard,'' Milos said. ``He was picked on because
he was small.''
   Spillane initially downplayed the proposal to rename part of
South Broad Street to Mickey Spillane Way.
   ``I don't believe in self-adulation,'' he said. ``Streets should
be named after birds or numbers or something.''

   The General Motors Corp. division kicks off a series of TV spots
Friday night with the theme, ``This is not your father's

   In one ad, Starr is chased by a crowd of middle-aged women and
slides down a banquet table and out a 12th-floor window. His fall is
broken by an awning and he winds up in the passenger seat of a new

   Olds says its average buyer is 51 years old. Company executives
would like that age to drop into the upper 40s.

   Dith Pran, whose escape from the bloody
Khmer Rouge was depicted in the movie ``The Killing Fields,'' and
Haing Ngor, the actor who won an Oscar portraying him, have met with
Cambodian Premier Hun Sen.
   The official news agency SPK, in a report monitored Wednesday in
Bangkok, quoted Hun Sen as calling the 1984 movie ``one of the most
important events which deals with the suffering of the Cambodian
people in the genocidal Pol Pot regime.''
   Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
from 1975 to 1978, when Vietnam invaded the country and ousted the
radical communist group.
   Dith, now a photographer for The New York Times, escaped Cambodia
after a hazardous trek to Thailand through fields littered with the
bones of Khmer Rouge victims. Former Times correspondent Sydney
Schanberg originally told Dith's story.
   Haing, a former physician, also fled the Khmer Rouge.
   Dith and Haing traveled to Phnom Penh at Hun Sen's invitation and
met with him Monday. It was their first return to their homeland
since they left refugee camps on the Thai border in 1979 for the
United States.
   They were part of a delegation from the Cambodian Documentation
Center in New York, which wants to bring the Khmer Rouge to trial
for war crimes and repatriate about 250,000 Cambodian refugees
living in Thailand.

   A judge sentenced James Meredith Jr., son
of the civil rights activist, to one year's house arrest for a 1987
car crash that killed two people.
   Meredith pleaded no contest in February to two counts of
vehicular manslaughter in the crash that killed Paul Huard, 44, and
Kevin Jones, 26.
   Huard and Jones, who worked with Meredith at a restaurant, were
riding in Meredith's sports car when it missed a curve and struck a
large boulder. Police said speed and alcohol were factors in the
crash. Meredith, 20, was seriously injured.
   Superior Court Justice Roland Cole on Tuesday sentenced Meredith
to two years in prison, both suspended, followed by two years'
probation. Cole also fined Meredith $350 and suspended his license
for five years.
   Meredith, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, will serve
his house arrest in Pennsylvania, Deputy District Attorney Anne
Jordan said.
   The elder Meredith was admitted to the University of Mississippi
in 1962, becoming the first black to enroll there. Four years later
he was wounded by shotgun blasts during a civil rights march across
Mississippi.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka Renews Push for Indian Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa said
Wednesday he was renewing efforts for a pullout of Indian soldiers
from this island torn by a Tamil revolt and a backlash that has
killed 57 more people in the past two days.
   Military officials said the new victims were all killed in
violence stemming from the country's radical Sinhalese backlash. The
radicals are fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government, which they
accuse of making too many concessions to ethnic Tamil militants.
   Premadasa said he had sent new proposals to New Delhi for the
speedy withdrawal of the 40,000 Indian soldiers in northeastern Sri
Lanka.
   ``I have sought specifically to ensure that our country's
sovereignty is recognized, safeguarded and maintained while the
withdrawal of the Indian peacekeeping force proceeds on an
accelerated basis,'' he said.
   ``This will ensure the realization of our objective of safety and
security for all and an early restoration of peace and normalcy,''
he said.
   However, the statement gave no details of the new proposals.
   Indian troops were deployed in Sri Lanka's Tamil-majority north
and east to enforce a 1987 peace accord that gave Tamil rebels
limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender. However, the
Indian troops later began fighting a rebel militia that renounced
the peace plan.
   Premadasa, who was elected to office in December with a mandate
to negotiate an Indian withdrawal, had called for a complete pullout
of the soldiers by July 29.
   The demand caused a diplomatic battle with New Delhi, which said
a hasty withdrawal could allow violence to escalate on this island
off its southern coast. However, both countries agreed to talks, and
India withdrew about 2,000 soldiers.
   India got involved in Sri Lanka's strife because of the
sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the country's population.
   Militants Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983, claiming
they were being discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The war has
claimed at least 11,000 lives, including about 4,000 people killed
in the Sinhalese uprising.
   Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 57
of those victims were killed or found dead on Tuesday and Wednesday
in scattered violence across the Sinhalese south and center of the
island.
   The victims included 18 policemen and soldiers, eight suspected
radicals, seven civilians killed in militant attacks, and 24 bodies
found with gunshot wounds, they said.
   Among them were six government soldiers killed when Sinhalese
militants ambushed an army jeep in southern Sri Lanka, the officials
said.
   Opposition groups and human rights organizations have claimed
that bodies found in the Sinhalese heartland are those of suspected
radicals killed by security forces or pro-government vigilante
groups.
   The government has denied the charges, but senior officials
privately admit that members of the security forces have committed
abuses in their efforts to halt the radicals' campaign of
assassination and terror.
   On Tuesday, officials and independent sources said at least 61
people had been killed since Sunday in the Sinhalese violence.

   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung
underwent questioning Wednesday by prosecutors who have linked him
to a North Korean spy case, and he vowed to fight the accusations in
court if necessary.
   Government prosecutors have not filed formal charges against him,
but they have said they have enough evidence to do so.
   Newspapers quoted unidentified prosecution officials as saying
Kim would soon be indicted with two other lawmakers of his Party for
Peace and Democracy. The reports said they would be accused of
violating national security laws.
   ``Should the prosecution indict me, I will fight squarely in
court,'' Kim, 64, said after the questioning. ``I am innocent, and I
expect truth to be established.''
   He also has denied wrongdoing in the past. He has said the
government is harassing him and trying to embarrass the political
opposition.
   Kim, the leader of the country's largest opposition party, has
twice been indicted on charges of violating national security laws.
The two-time presidential candidate has spent almost seven years in
prison for sedition and anti-government activity in 1976 and 1980.
   He was allowed to leave early Wednesday after a 15-hour
interrogation by prosecutors. It was the second time in three weeks
he has faced questioning about the illegal trip to North Korea by
then-lawmaker Suh Kyung-won.
   Suh was arrested on June 28 and ousted from Kim's party because
of the publicity. He has been charged with espionage, making the
unauthorized trip to North Korea in August 1988, and receiving money
from North Korean agents.
   The opposition leader is suspected of receiving $10,000 from Suh,
who admitted to investigators that he was given $50,000 after
meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   Kim Dae-jung also is accused of knowing of Suh's trip two months
before the case was made public in June 1988. Failure to report such
a case to authorities is a crime under Korean law.
   Unauthorized visits to North Korea are also outlawed.
   Prosecutors have indicated they will also indict floor leader Kim
Won-ki and Rep. Lee Chul-yong, both of Kim's party, on charges of
failing to report Suh's case. The two lawmakers have denied the
accusation.

   The Boston Public Library is searching its stacks
and reading rooms for a visitor who has caused a stir with his taste
in shoes _ shoes belonging to other people who have slipped them off
while lost in a book.
   And he only takes one at a time.
   Library spokesman Arthur Dunphy said three shoes have been stolen
from under library tables in the past month.
   All the victims so far have been female, Dunphy said. Each made
herself comfortable at a table on the carpeted floors of the
library's general building on Copley Square.
   Some slipped off their shoes while they sat at a table reading.
Another found one shoe missing after she had padded off to the
copier machine barefoot.
   Library security officers said they did not think the crimes were
the work of a sure-footed prankster, but rather some kind of
shoe-crazed social deviant.
   ``He's a shoe freak,'' security supervisor Lt. George Butner said
Wednesday. ``You have to tell it like it is: He's a sniff freak. He
must have a closetful by now.''
   Butner said the thief has taken high heels and flats of different
sizes.
   Library personnel said they don't expect the thief to get away
with many more heists.
   According to Dunphy, the victims have been able to offer
consistent descriptions, once they think back to who was sitting
across from them.
   Butner described the suspect as a 23-year-old man with earrings
in his nose and one ear.
   Dunphy said the library would not warn patrons to keep their
shoes _ like their wallets and pocketbooks _ on their person.
   ``It's not an epidemic,'' he said.
   Librarians elsewhere in the Boston system said shoes at their
branches stay put.
   ``Isn't that bizarre?'' said Paula Posniak, a librarian at the
West End branch. ``No, we've got people that curse, talk to
themselves, write all over newpapers, but no shoes, thank God.
Please don't send them here.''

<TEXT>
   A Philadelphia jury was bused 112 miles to
Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday for the trial of a couple accused of
letting their 14-year-old son starve to death even though they had
thousands of dollars in the bank.
   Testimony in the third-degree murder case begins Friday.
   Eric Cottam died in January because his parents, Larry and Leona
Cottam, failed to provide food for the family for six weeks after
Cottam lost his truck-driving job, according to police. At
5-foot-10, the boy weighed 69 pounds, according to coroner's reports.
   Cottam, a former minister in the Seventh Day Adventist church,
had $3,775 in the bank but he said he couldn't touch that money
because it belonged to God.
   Judge Gifford Cappellini, faced with widespread publicity on the
case in Luzerne County, came to Philadelphia on Aug. 14 to pick a
jury. After two weeks of trying to pick a jury in the Wilkes-Barre
area, the judge said moving to Philadelphia was the only way to come
up with a fair panel.
   The Cottams, who live in Nuangola, also are charged with
endangering a minor. That charge stems from the plight of a
12-year-old daughter, Laura, who, like her parents, suffered severe
malnutrition when the family was finally rescued after the boy's
death. She is now in state custody.
   If convicted of the third-degree murder charge, the Cottams each
face a maximum 20-year prison term.
   The Cottams, each free on $50,000 bail, declined comment after
the jury was completed.
   The judge said the jury would be sworn in Friday just before
opening statements. The trial is expected to last three weeks.

   Attorneys for former Marine Sgt. Clayton
Lonetree on Wednesday failed to stop distribution of a book about
his role in a sex-for-secrets scandal at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton refused to grant a preliminary
restraining order against the publisher, Henry Holt and Co. Inc. of
New York, saying Lonetree had waited too long to try to stop the
book sales.
   Lonetree, of St. Paul, Minn., claims the book, ``The
Court-Martial of Clayton Lonetree,'' contains confidential
information obtained by his defense team that could be used against
him if he wins a new trial on his espionage conviction.
   But Hilton said it was too late.
   ``These matters have already been in the press,'' the judge said.
``It's already out.''
   Holt published the book in June and says it has sold about half
the 13,000 copies.
   Hilton also said Lonetree had not proven that publication would
hurt his chances of reversing his conviction.
   Lonetree filed suit last week seeking $100,000 in punitive
damages from Holt and Las Vegas private investigator Lake Headley,
who worked for Lonetree's lawyers during the court-martial and
helped write the book.
   Lonetree was convicted in 1987 of passing U.S. Embassy floor
plans and the names of CIA agents to the Soviet Union at the request
of his Soviet lover. At the time, Lonetree was stationed as a
security guard in Moscow and Vienna, Austria.
   The book purportedly contains details of Lonetree's affair and
espionage activities that had not been disclosed before.
   An attorney for Lonetree, Lee Calligaro, argued that Headley
disclosed information about the case that Lonetree provided in
confidence to the investigator and his attorneys.
   During the hearing Wednesday, Calligaro read a passage of the
book that described in detail how Lonetree considered killing
himself. The information could only have come from Lonetree's
defense team, Calligaro said.
   ``The public and court system have an abiding and deep concern in
the sanctity of the attorney-client privilege,'' Calligaro said.
   Robert Callagy, an attorney representing Holt, told the judge
Lonetree ``has been on notice for at least nine months that Holt is
going forward with this publication.''
   The publisher claims Lonetree waived his right to maintain the
confidentiality of the information he gave his lawyers. Lonetree is
quoted in the book as once having told Headley: ``When this is over,
I want you to get my story out to the public.''
   Lonetree is serving a 25-year prison sentence at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan. An appeal of his conviction is pending with the
U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review in Washington.

<TEXT>
   Mississippians were urged Wednesday to
protect themselves against mosquito bites following confirmation
that an 11-year-old boy died of the rare eastern equine
encephalitis, or sleeping sickness.
   ``This is the first reported death from this disease in the
country this year,'' said Dr. Ted Tsai of the Centers for Disease
Control office in Ft. Collins, Colo. ``We had only two cases
reported last year and both resulted in death.''
   Tsai said the fatality rate among horses and humans is about 30
percent. He said both deaths last year occurred in the Southeast.
   The boy, who lived in a heavily wooded area of southern
Mississippi, died Aug. 6 at the University Medical Center in Jackson
and a blood sample was sent to the CDC in Atlanta, said Lisa Ruble,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Health.
   It was confirmed last week that the boy died of the encephalitis.
   The presence of the virus in the area was confirmed by a
department entomologist, Jerome Goddard. He said the disease is
carried by birds and is occasionally transmitted to horses and
humans by mosquitoes. Cases occur along the eastern seaboard and
Gulf Coast of the United States as well as in Canada and Central and
South America.
   Only 46 human cases were reported from 1965 to 1975 in the United
States, Ruble said, and no record of a case in Mississippi in at
least a decade.
   Heavy rains earlier this year led to an unusually large mosquito
population statewide, health officials said.
   The disease affects all ages but is particularly severe in
infants and children, said Ed Thompson, state epidemiologist.
Characteristics of the disease include a sudden onset of high fever,
vomiting, drowsiness or coma, twitching, and severe convulsions.
   ``Up to 50 percent of people who display such symptoms and
develop the disease die,'' Thompson said. ``Survivors of the disease
under 5 years of age often suffer mental retardation or paralysis;
most people over 40 recover completely.''
   No specific treatment is available but appropriate medical care
can improve chances of survival, health officials said.
   Cases of eastern equine encephalitis in horses have been
confirmed in recent months in three Mississippi counties and
suspected cases are being investigated in three others.

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas Wednesday to
disperse thousands of anti-apartheid protesters, including
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and stone-throwing crowds in several
townships outside Cape Town.
   Columns of black smoke from burning street barricades were
visible across the densely populated Cape Flats, northeast of the
city center.
   The unrest has occurred almost daily for more than three weeks,
coinciding with the launch of a nationwide campaign to defy
apartheid restrictions.
   The Cape Town area has been the most troubled section in the
country. The area has experienced the most sustained series of
confrontations between police and activists in two years.
   Police headquarters said officers encountered stone-throwing
youths in at least seven black and mixed-race communities near Cape
Town on Wednesday.
   Tutu said that if Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok ``does not
constrain his security forces, and if they behave the way they did
today, then we are on the brink of a major disaster.''
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa, tried to
mediate between police officials and protesting youths in the black
township of Guguletu.
   The archbishop persuaded the youths to call off a planned march
from a high school to a police station, where they intended to
demand the release of several students and teachers detained in
recent weeks. Instead, Tutu arranged for a small delegation to go to
the station to present the demands.
   But police fired tear gas at Tutu, other clergymen, a white
opposition member of Parliament and hundreds of other people as they
emerged from a church where the archbishop had been reporting on the
latest developments.
   Tutu said the tear gas was fired without warning after he urged
the protesters to disperse peacefully.
   Police showed an ``incredible impatience and eagerness to use the
whole range of their armory,'' said Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize.
   He said he was surprised that youths ``were still listening to
community leaders who urged non-violence. If I was young, I would
not listen to Archbishop Tutu.''
   Police also used tear gas on several thousand marchers at the
University of the Western Cape, a militantly anti-government school
where most students are mixed-race.
   The marchers, including teachers, students and workers, were
fired at with tear gas as they reached the main gate of the campus,
leading out to a highway. The marchers carried placards supporting
the defiance campaign and criticizing police action against
activists.
   Organizers said further protests were planned to oppose the visit
to South Africa by an international rugby team, which activists say
is undermining the sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid. The
visiting team is scheduled to play South Africa's national team in
Cape Town on Saturday.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A federal appeals court panel held a hearing
behind closed doors Wednesday to protect secrets during arguments
about an Iran-Contra criminal case against a former CIA official.
   Edward Dennis, acting deputy attorney general, said the
three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would
hear information relating to national security.
   Judge Robert F. Chapman of Columbia, S.C., said federal law
required him to close the hearing if the attorney general's office
made that certification.
   ``There's nothing else we can do,'' Chapman said. ``The lives of
people who work for the United States would be endangered'' by an
open hearing, he said.
   Timothy Dyk, an attorney for several media outlets, had objected
to the closing on constitutional grounds. The court refused to hear
his arguments.
   The Justice Department and the office of independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh are feuding over how to proceed in the case against
Joseph Fernandez, a former CIA station chief in Costa Rica.
   The Justice Department wants to appeal a federal judge's ruling
that Fernandez may disclose as part of his defense secret
information that the department says would jeopardize national
security.
   However, Walsh's office says an appeal is a prosecutorial
function granted specifically to the independent counsel's office by
federal law. Lawyers for Walsh say the Justice Department's appeal,
in effect, would wrest control of the case from the independent
counsel.
   Gerard Lynch, an attorney for the independent counsel, told the
appeals court that the proper procedure for the Justice Department
would be to file an affidavit under the Classified Information
Procedures Act barring disclosure of the information.
   Dennis said such action almost surely would lead to dismissal of
some or all of the charges against Fernandez. Two counts in the
Iran-Contra case against Oliver North were dropped because
information vital to the prosecution could not be disclosed for
national security reasons.
   ``We're not trying to prosecute the case,'' Dennis said. ``But
the impact of an affidavit is appropriate for us to consider. It
would risk dismissal of the prosecution.''
   If that happened, Lynch said, the independent counsel's office
would appeal the dismissal.
   ``It's inevitably a two-headed monster here,'' Lynch said. ``The
question is which head is going to control the decisions.''
   Fernandez is accused of lying to investigators about his
assistance to North's Contra network. He is charged with two counts
of obstruction and two counts of making false statements to the CIA
inspector general's office and the Tower Commission in 1987.
   Among the secrets U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton of
Alexandria, Va., ruled Chapman has a right to disclose are the
locations of CIA stations in El Salvador and Honduras and another
CIA facility in a Latin American country.
   Hilton also ruled Chapman may reveal details about a
communications station and other projects in Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Workers Complain Of Ill Effects From Fertilizer</HEAD>

   More than a half-dozen oil spill cleanup
workers have reported being burned or suffering other problems from
fertilizer being spread on Alaska beaches to help oil-eating
bacteria grow.
   Six workers on two beaches on the southern end of the Kenai
Peninsula apparently suffered minor burns last week from the ammonia
nitrate fertilizer, said industrial hygienist Mack Davis of the
state Office of Safety and Health.
   There have been at least three more cases since then, Steve
Provant, the state on-scene coordinator for the cleanup, said
Tuesday. The cleanup has been going on since 11 million gallons of
oil were spilled March 24 by the tanker Exxon Valdez in Prince
William Sound.
   The Coast Guard has begun requiring that workers spreading the
nutrient on the beaches wear respirators.
   Exxon has applied ammonia nitrate to 17 miles of beach so far.
Seventy more miles of coastline are to be fertilized to help
encourage microbes to devour some of the remaining oil.
   Workers suffered blisters and rashes on their hands, said health
aide Sandy Elvsaas in Seldovia. When the blisters burst, they leave
large, red patches of raw skin.
   ``It looks basically like a burn,'' she said. Elvsaas said the
workers she treated appeared to be healing well.
   Gary Hanson, foreman of a beach crew working near the head of
Chugach Bay, said workers saw the fertilizer on the beach and picked
some of it up. He said they were never warned not to.
   Workers who wear protective clothing issued to cleanup crews
shouldn't have any problem with the fertilizer, state safety and
health officials said.
   But because it is hot on the beaches, workers sometime discard
gear, Hanson said. Workers cutting oily logs into firewood-sized
chunks couldn't survive inside the plastic suits. ``It's a
sweatbox,'' he said.
   Exxon is doing urine analyses to determine whether workers have
absorbed unhealthy doses of ammonia nitrate, Bill Rainey, Exxon's
director of operations for the spill, said Tuesday.
   There should be no health risks from the fertilizer if it is
washed off with soap and water, he said.

<HEAD>Extra Precautions as Extraditions Near</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials said Wednesday they are taking
extra security precautions to guard aginst terrorist retributions
stemming from the extradition of Colombian drug figures to stand
trial in the United States.
   The initial focus will be on Eduard Martinez Romero, who
allegedly laundered money for the Medellin drug cartel, was arrested
over the weekend and was awaiting extradition to the United States,
officials said.
   After that, the extent of the precautions will depend on how
successful Colombian authorities are in their efforts to arrest 12
Medellin cartel leaders whose extradition was requested Tuesday by
the Justice Department.
   ``If they got the top people, we would presume that the rest of
the cartel would be preoccupied in reorganizing and not have too
much time to worry about revenge,'' said one government expert in
drug terrorism.
   ``If they got only lower level people, the cartel might try some
kind of retribution, but it is not clear whether it would be in the
United States. Doing it in this country would be quite a
challenge,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not be
named.
   U.S. diplomats in Colombia and other Latin American countries
where the cartel has staged successful terrorist attacks have been
operating on a heightened state of alert, said State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher.
   ``I would say that our people in Colombia and in other places
where ... threat exists, have always been on a high state of
readiness or care in their security procedures. ... That
continues,'' said Boucher.
   Boucher said U.S. officials ``expect to meet this week with
senior Colombian government officials to continue our discussion of
the details of the extradition process,'' but he declined to say
when, where or who would be involved.
   ``We're trying to avoid too much focus on specific meetings and
individuals because of the security situation,'' said Boucher.
   Another State Department official, asking not to be further
identified, said top Colombian officials were traveling to
Washington to meet with U.S. officials.
   The major cartel figure arrested so far, Martinez, was to face
trial in Atlanta, where he has been indicted on drug charges
stemming from an investigation called ``Operation Polar Cap.''
   Although he is not alleged to be the cartel's financial chief,
Martinez is thought to have detailed information about some aspects
of the drug ring, and U.S. officials said they would take steps to
guard against attempts to free him.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service, Bill Dempsey, said it
was impossible to predict what security measures would be needed to
handle other alleged drug figures Colombia hopes to arrest for
deportation to the United States.
   ``Every effort would be made to provide all the necessary
security and the resources would be obtained to provide the security
for the extradition of the individuals,'' Dempsey said.
   Officials declined to specify how Martinez and others would be
protected while in federal custody, but said security would be
similar to that surrounding the trials of Colombian drug lord Carlos
Lehder Rivas, convicted in 1987 in Jacksonville, Fla., and the trial
in Washington earlier this year of Fawaz Younis, convicted of
hijacking a Jordanian airliner.
   For Lehder's trial, marshals are believed to have used a Postal
Service vehicle to smuggle him in and out of the federal courthouse
in Jacksonville. Armed guards wearing bullet-proof vest and carrying
automatic rifles were posted on nearby roofs and bomb-sniffing dogs
roamed the corridors.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle was given a guarded safe house in
Jacksonville and U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton was escorted
to court by marshals.
   The Marshals Service estimated that security at the Lehder trial
cost about $2.4 million, including about $1 million in overtime for
the 200 marshals brought in on rotation. An average of 32 to 39 were
on duty each day.
   When Younis was arrested and brought to the United States in
September 1987, he was kept in the brig at the Quantico, Va., Marine
base near Washington, then moved to a federal prison in Otisville.
N.Y., according to sources close to the case. Federal officials have
never disclosed where he was being held.
   To prosecute Younis, federal officials moved more than two dozen
Lebanese and Jordanian witnesses and their relatives to the United
States, and have provided them with new identities and careers,
according to testimony at the trial. Federal officials have refused
to disclose the total cost.

   A core of overwhelmingly white producers and
writers are ``creating characters in their own image,'' producing
artificial portrayals of blacks and other minorities on TV, a
women's group charged Wednesday.
   ``Racial tension is commonplace in the real world, but virtually
invisible among white and minority characters on entertainment
television,'' concluded Sally Steenland, author of a Ford
Foundation-financed study on how minorities are portrayed in the
media.
   The study _ ``Unequal Picture: Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native
American Characters on Television'' _ was released by Wider
Opportunities for Women, a non-profit group working to promote
equality in the workplace.
   Among its major findings:
   _Nine of 10 minority characters are middle class or wealthy where
``in reality more than 40 percent of minority men and 60 percent of
minority women have incomes below $10,000 a year.''
   _``Most programs reduce injustice to individual conflict, denying
the reality of oppressive social structures, except for a very few
shows which present a multicultural world.''
   _Only situation comedies provide minority female characters as
leading roles. ``Almost three-quarters of all minority females on
television are featured in comedies.''
   _Workplaces are portrayed as ``egalitarian ... with no hint of
bias, even though whites are almost always in charge.''
   The study examined more than 150 episodes of 30 network
television series featuring minorities in recurring roles.
   Of the 78 minority characters on prime time TV, the study found
that the overwhelming majority, 65 _ or 83 percent _ were blacks.
Blacks account for about 55 percent of the nation's minority
population, according to Census Bureau data.
   Hispanics accounted for only 12 percent of the minority
characters on TV while they compose about 35 percent of the minority
population. Asians, about 6 percent of the minority population,
constituted about 4 percent of the minority characters on TV.
   Native Americans _ Indians _ constituted only 1 percent of the
minority characters protrayed on in TV. In reality, native Americans
make up about 2 percent of the minority population.
   Of the 162 producers working on the 30 shows, only 12 were
blacks, Hispanics, Asians or Native Americans, the study said. And
of the 12 minority producers, only four were women.
   ``No wonder TV's integrated world is such a happy one,'' said
Steenland. ``No wonder minority characters are nearly identical to
their white buddies. White producers and writers are creating
characters in their own image.''
   The study said the ``token status'' of minority producers and
writers in television can be overcome only through more aggressive
recruiting, hiring and promotion.

<HEAD>Cheney Accuses Soviets of Bolstering Strategic Forces</HEAD>

   While Congress fiddles with defense budget
cuts, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is building a ``more
dangerous'' strategic arsenal, despite his attention-getting offers
to slash military spending, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
Wednesday.
   ``The Soviet Union has been making major improvements to every
leg of its strategic arsenal,'' Cheney said. ``In systems ranging
from intercontinental missiles and bombers to submarines and
strategic defense, the Soviet Union is getting stronger while our
Congress debates and our country treads water.''
   Despite some cuts, he said the Soviets ``may well be producing a
leaner and meaner military force, and not just a smaller one.''
   He made the remarks in an address prepared for delivery to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars national convention in Las Vegas, Nev. A
text was made available at the Pentagon.
   Cheney, in some of his harshest criticism to date against his
former colleagues, lambasted the House for its budget-slashing
approach to President Bush's Pentagon spending plan for the 1990
fiscal year.
   The former Wyoming congressman accused the House of gutting the
administration's military requests and ``using the defense budget as
a jobs program.''
   Cheney faulted the House's decision to limit production of the
B-2 Stealth bomber, carve $1.8 billion from the Strategic Defense
Initiative, slash the MX rail garrison system and delete $100
million for the Midgetman missile from the budget.
   The House and Senate will meet in early September to craft a
final blueprint on $295 billion in Pentagon spending. Cheney warned
that if the two chambers produce similar decisions in their upcoming
conference, the bill will be ``veto bait'' for the president.
   He charged that many in the House ``seem to think there is no
real threat anymore'' from the Soviets.
   ``They have seen some changes and apparently believe that
everything now is just fine. It's as if they decided to give away
their overcoats on the first sunny day in January,'' he said.
   While Cheney's tone offered a contrast to the current climate of
improved U.S.-Soviet relations, he did note that the recently
improved U.S.-Soviet ties paved the way for the INF treaty banning
intermediate nuclear weapons in Europe, talks on slashing the
superpowers' strategic weapons and discussion on cutting
conventional forces in Europe.
   But he said he could not say there was a reduced Soviet threat.
   ``If anything, the United States is facing a more formidable
offensive strategic arsenal today than before Mr. Gorbachev took
power. That's right: I said more formidable, not less,'' Cheney said.
   ``Although there has been talk of a 14 percent cut in its defense
budget, since 1985 Soviet defense expenditures have actually
increased by an average of 3 percent per year in real terms. At the
same time, our defense spending has declined in real terms by over
11 percent,'' Cheney said.
   As evidence of the heightened threat, the Pentagon chief pointed
to the Soviets' 170 mobile SS-25, single-warhead intercontinental
nuclear missiles, their 58 SS-24 missiles, each of which carries 10
independently targetable nuclear warheads, and their modernization
program for their 300 SS-18 missiles, which also carry 10 warheads.
   ``However friendly Mr. Gorbachev may sound, however friendly he
may in some respects wish to be, he cannot explain the deployment of
the beefed-up SS-18 as a friendly act,'' Cheney said.
   The secretary called for a tough U.S. response to the Soviet
program, saying, ``We need to modernize our own strategic forces
because Soviet strategic capabilities are becoming more dangerous
under Mr. Gorbachev, despite his popular impression to the
contrary.''
   Cheney called for restoration of the president's budget requests
in order to respond adequately to the Soviet threat.
   ``The Soviets are moving forward. It would be irresponsible for
the United States to try to get by with aging systems,'' Cheney said.
   A study by the CIA and the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency
issued in April reported that Soviet defense spending rose 3 percent
last year, despite Gorbachev's promises to cut his military budget.
   The study added, however, that it appeared Gorbachev was laying
the groundwork for his proposed 14.2 percent cut in defense spending.

   President Bush praised Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday for urging the Polish
Communist Party to participate in the new Solidarity-led government,
saying the intervention was ``a positive sign.''
   Bush also told reporters at his vacation home that administration
and Colombian officials were discussing what U.S. aid the South
American nation might need to help fight drug cartels.
   And the president said he had no problem with France sending its
warships into the Mediterranean although the action has provoked
threatening statements from the pro-Iranian terrorists holding
Americans hostage in Lebanon.
   ``I am not about to criticize the French for what they are
doing,'' in sending ships to stand by for possible evacuation of
French nationals from Lebanon, he said. ``They have tried to be a
catalyst for peace in Lebanon.''
   Bush, standing with his back to the ocean at his scenic seaside
home, took questions on a variety of topics from a group of Maine
reporters and several Washington reporters traveling with him.
   He then took the group to watch his wife, Barbara, play doubles
tennis to prove she was feeling fine after being prescribed a new
medication for eye irritation stemming from her Graves Disease.
   Bush was asked if he thought the Soviets were playing a helpful
role in Poland in light of Gorbachev's 40-minute phone call to
Soviet Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski. After the
call, Polish communist leaders announced they would be willing to
enter a partnership with the evolving Solidarity-led government.
   On Sunday, the Polish communists had demanded more than the two
ministerial posts promised to them earlier in an agreement with
Solidarity and had said it wanted to be treated as a full governing
partner in the new government.
   The Communists, in the unusual announcement of Gorbachev's call,
indicated anew their insistence on a strong Communist presence in
the government, but also reflected Moscow's acceptance of the idea
that the party should reach an accommodation with the Solidarity-led
coalition.
   ``There are a lot of changes taking place. ... It will be far
reaching. There will be bumps in the road as these countries more
toward more democracy. There's no question about that,'' Bush said.
   ``But I feel the statement I saw attributed to Mr. Gorbachev was
very positive in this regard _ very.''
   On another matter, Bush said that Vice President Dan Quayle had
``ably spelled out our policy'' when he said that humanitarian aid
to the Nicaraguan Contras should continue ``until safe and
democratic conditions'' exist in Nicaragua, even after the elections
there in February.
   ``I don't want to see the mandatory demobilization of those
Contras before the elections. I've felt ... that the pressure from
the Contras has been the thing that's led (President Daniel) Ortega
to start moving a little bit on free, fair elections,'' Bush said.
   Officials have said the administration supports the ongoing peace
efforts of the Central American presidents, who have called for
demobilization of the Contras by year's end coupled with democratic
reforms in Nicaragua.
   Bush reiterated his support for Colombia's President Virgilio
Barco in that nation's attempted crackdown on drug lords.
   ``I have great respect for what President Barco is trying to do
... It's a tough problem that he faces. I am convinced he is
determined to whip the problem, to beat it and free his country from
the grip of drug cartels.''
   He said speculation that the United States might send troops to
help Barco's anti-drug efforts ``got out of whack'' in news accounts
after Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Sunday that would be an
option if Barco asked for it. Barco has said since that he does not
want U.S. military personnel and administration officials have said
there are no plans to send troops.
   If such aid were requested, Bush said, ``Of course I'd take that
under consideration, but that is not what's being considered at
all.''
   On other matters Bush said:
   _He does ``my very best'' to stay in touch with average people's
concerns. Asked how he can relate to the average Maine resident, who
makes just over 15,000 a year, Bush replied:
   ``I'm very privileged and lucky in that regard. But I also don't
think the average Mainer begrudges me a vacation of any kind ...
I've got a lot of friends from all walks of life. And there is a
little tendency in this job to get isolated.''
   _Asked why Americans give him such favorable poll ratings, he
replied:
   ``Some of it is my wife. Some of it is the fact, I think people
see that we're trying hard. It's fundamental values. Some of it is
that I've tried to calm things down and work with Congress.''

   An Algerian demanding peace in Lebanon
hijacked an Air France jetliner Wednesday after it left Paris, but
he was arrested after landing armed only with a can of shaving cream
and soap, officials said.
   The unarmed emigre who had a history of petty crime said he took
over the passenger flight from Paris to Algiers to call attention to
``the need to end violence in Lebanon and Palestine.''
   The plane's pilot, Joseph Valat, told Algerian Radio the hijacker
had asked to go to Tunis, Tunisia, then the Algerian cities of
Annaba and Constantine, but those airports refused landing
permission and the aircraft landed at its original destination of
Algiers.
   Valat said the air pirate had used a can of shaving cream as his
``weapon.'' He earlier was reported to have used a bottle of spray
perfume.
   In a statement at Algiers' Houari Boumedienne airport, he called
for ``the holding of an international conference on Lebanon, the
opening of a dialogue between the PLO and Israel and the liberation
of all hostages and prisoners in the region.''
   Algerian police identified the hijacker as Said Djamel, alias
Bendada, and said he was a 30-year-old merchant in Paris.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified
sources in Paris, said the man was being expelled for ``violating
public order,'' and said he ``displayed great agitation'' before
being put on the flight to Algiers.
   An Air France spokeswoman said the hijacking ended at 3:25 p.m.
(10:25 a.m. EDT), barely an hour after the plane landed. She said
the 102 passengers and 13 crew members were safe.
   The air pirate, allowed to make a statement before being taken
for questioning, told reporters he used the toiletry articles as his
only ``weapons.''
   The pilot, in a statement at the airport, said the hijacker had a
big object under his jacket to give the appearance of a weapon and
that he made known he was capable of blowing up the plane. In the
radio interview later, he said the air pirate had concealed a can of
shaving cream.
   The hijacking came amid heightened tensions between France and
Moslem forces fighting in Lebanon. The Syrian forces and their
allied Moslem militias recently said they would shell French
warships gathering in the eastern Mediterranean if they intervened
militarily in Lebanon.
   France said the warships were dispatched to evacuate 7,000 French
nationals in Lebanon if the 5-month-old battle between Moslem and
Christian forces worsens. But the Moslems accuse the French of
backing the Christians.

   Increasingly exciting images sent back by
Voyager 2 as it nears Neptune show that a partial ring extends over
two-thirds of the planet and is probably a second complete ring
``like we've never seen before,'' scientists said Wednesday.
   ``We've got people literally jumping up and down up there'' where
scientists are analyzing the latest photos at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said Bradford Smith, leader of the imaging team.
   The images show Triton, Neptune's curious backward-orbiting moon,
to be a bright pink, red and blue marble, covered with discolored
patches of frozen natural gas, or methane.
   Dark areas near the moon's equator are in fact a very deep red,
said Smith. Much of the southern portion of the moon is pink with
what appears to be a blue fringe.
   ``If it is indeed blue, it's the only thing we've seen blue on
any satellite since we launched Voyager,'' said Smith.
   Concern that Triton's surface might be blocked from view by
clouds has now subsided.
   ``Almost certainly we're seeing the surface,'' Smith said. ``That
suggests some real excitement here Friday morning and again on
Saturday,'' when Voyager sends back photographs from its closest
pass by Triton.
   Partial rings around Neptune were first observed by Voyager on
Aug. 11. On Tuesday, scientists announced that the fainter of the
two so-called ring arcs was a complete ring.
   As Voyager nears its closest pass of Neptune Thursday at 8:56
p.m. PDT researchers expect it to reveal that the brighter arc
extends all the way around the pale blue planet.
   ``Probably it's a ring,'' said Smith. ``But it's a ring like
we've never seen before.''
   Researchers also expect to find at least two new moons near
Neptune, beyond the two previously known and the four already
discovered by Voyager, Smith said.
   Final commands to direct the pointing of Voyager's cameras and
other instruments were transmitted to the spacecraft Wednesday
afternoon, incorporating the latest data available on the precise
locations of Neptune, Triton and associated moons and rings.
   Researchers spotted the first possibility of a meteorite crater
on Triton. ``I saw a circular feature,'' said Smith. ``Certainly an
impact crater is a possibility,'' but confirmation will await more
detailed images, he said.
   Two days of tracking the spacecraft since the execution of a
delicate, unorthodox course correction Monday show that the new
trajectory is right on target.
   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile flight, Voyager will be within
one second and within 20 miles of where it is supposed to be for the
Neptune encounter, said Douglas Griffith, deputy mission manager.
   The spacecraft will pass 3,042 miles from Neptune's cloud tops
and 23,888 miles from Triton, said Robert Cesarone of the navigation
team.
   Because of uncertainties about the size of the two bodies and the
strength of their gravitational fields, there is an uncertainty of
about 20 miles in the distance to Neptune and 120 miles in the
distance to Triton, Cesarone said.
   The course maneuver, using two small thrusters instead of the
spacecraft's main thruster to avoid heating and thereby disrupting a
sensitive radio receiver, had been practiced once but never
attempted before, scientists said.
   ``There are an awful lot of happy scientists with respect to the
wonderful job the navigation team has done,'' said Edward Stone,
Voyager project scientist. ``This means we'll have our full ability
to find out what's there.''
   The new course will allow the spacecraft to pass behind Neptune
as seen from both the Earth and the sun. As it passes behind the
planet, it will send radio signals to Earth through Neptune's
atmosphere and analyze sunlight passing through the atmosphere,
providing detailed information on the atmosphere's makeup, said
Norman Haynes, Voyager project manager.

now are free.
   Hidipo Hamutenya, spokesman for the South-West Africa People's
Organization, said the group would allow the International Red
Cross, Amnesty International and the United Nations to inspect sites
in Angola and Zambian where dissidents and suspected spies were
detained.
   The organizations have for years been denied access to the camps
despite repeated requests.
   Hamutenya said the guerrilla group released in May all 201
prisoners in its custody as part of the U.N.-sponsored plan to bring
independence to Namibia next year after 74 years of South African
rule.
   Former detainees have said the group still holds as many as 2,000
additional prisoners in underground pits. The ex-prisoners have
compiled a list with the names of more than 500 people they believe
still are detained or have been killed by the guerrilla group.
   ``The best way to get to the bottom of this issue is for the
groups we have mentioned to go to Angola (and Zambia) ... to satisfy
yourself,'' said Theo-Ben Gurirab, who handles South-West Africa
People's Organization's foreign affairs. ``We will continue to say
we are not holding any more prisoners.''
   Gurirab said some former prisoners ``were tortured and officers
charged with gathering information (from prisoners) ... carried out
brutalities against these persons, which we very much regret.''
   Gurirab said, however, that his group would reject a formal
international investigation of war-time abuses.
   After independence, expected early next year, church leaders,
tribal chiefs and community groups should conduct a ``full
inventory'' of alleged abuses by both the guerrillas and the South
African-led security forces, Gurirab said.
   The two sides fought a 23-year-bush war in northern Namibia, and
the security forces were accused of dozens of abuses against both
civilians and guerrillas.
   Many alleged abuses have been blamed on a paramilitary police
unit known as Koevoet, the Afrikaans word for ``crowbar.'' The unit
was disbanded in January, but many members were integrated into the
regular police force.
   The guerrilla organization, with U.N. backing, has said
ex-Koevoet members continue to harass civilians and should be
removed from the force. Namibia's South African administrator, Louis
Pienaar, has refused to dismiss ex-Koevoet fighters, but has
confined them to base.
   Gurirab said that unless intimidation of guerrilla supporters
ends, ``we cannot see how the election can be free and fair.
   ``We are for a clean campaign, but it is becoming difficult to
restrain our members,'' he added.
   More than 600,000 of an estimated 675,000 eligible voters have
registered for the polls. Namibia, the size of France and West
Germany combined, has only 1.3 million people and more than 50
percent are illiterate.
   Gurirab also said that South-West Africa People's Organization
leader Sam Nujoma has decided not to return to Namibia this weekend
and has set no date for coming back. He has been in exile since 1960.

   Vietnam's foreign minister said
Wednesday he expects an international peace conference on Cambodia
to reach a settlement in the decade-old war in that country.
   ``I expect there will be a comprehensive solution, but at the
same time I must be prepared for the worst,'' Nguyen Co Thach said
of prospects for the peace conference in Paris, where he will head
Friday.
   Thach was echoing remarks made by Cambodian Premier Hun Sen in
Phnom Penh on Thursday before he left for Paris. Vietnam invaded
Cambodia in 1978, ousting the communist Khmer Rouge regime and
installing another regime.
   Vietnam has pledged to withdraw its estimated 26,000 troops from
Cambodia by Sept. 26.
   Thach said he expects the main point of disagreement at the
conference to be the role of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia's future.
   ``The main difficulty is the question of recognition of the
genocide of Pol Pot,'' he said.
   Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
during its rule between 1975 and 1978. The Khmer Rouge now controls
the largest fighting force in the three-faction guerrilla alliance.
   The governments of Vietnam and Cambodia have insisted the Khmer
Rouge should not be allowed take part in any future coalition
government in Cambodia while its old leadership remains intact. The
United States has also said the Khmer Rouge should not be allowed to
return to power.
   The rebel clandestine radio station, Voice of The Khmer, on
Thursday quoted the guerrilla coalition leader, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, as ruling out a proposed two-party power-sharing
arrangement between his faction and Hun Sen.
   The report said Sihanouk restated his demand for forming a
provisional four-party government of all the Cambodian factions,
including the Khmer Rouge and the Hun Sen administration.
   The Paris conference, which began at the end of July, is being
attended by representatives of all four factions.
   The conference sent a investigation team to Cambodia to assess
the possibility of forming international mechanisms to help bring
peace to Cambodia.

<HEAD>Turkey to Close Railway Link to Europe to Block Refugee Influx</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto IST1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday it will shut
down its railway link with Europe to stop ethnic Turks from Bulgaria
who are trying to enter Turkey illegally.
   The single European train that travels daily between Munich, West
Germany, and Istanbul goes through Austria, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.
It is Turkey's only rail link to those countries.
   In his announcement, Foreign Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar told
reporters the train service would stop Friday. He said that until
then, all ethnic Turks traveling on the train without visas would be
turned back.
   Hundreds of ethnic Turks have been arriving daily on the train
since May. About 310,000 ethnic Turks from Bulgaria have flooded
into Turkey in the past three months by train and other means.
   The Turks say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign that
has forced them to use Slavic rather than Moslem names. They say
they have also been fined and beaten for speaking Turkish in public
and for practicing Islam.
   On Tuesday, Turkey began requiring visas for the refugees.
   Turkish officials initially tried to turn back a group of 522
ethnic Turks without visas who rode the European train on Tuesday.
But authorities allowed the refugees to cross the border after some
tried to jump out of the train.
   Sungar said Turkey might review its decision to close the railway
if the Bulgarian government guarantees it will not send immigrants
without visas on the trains.
   Turkish officials say they are trying to negotiate an immigration
accord guaranteeing protections for departing Bulgarian Turks, such
as compensation for property. The officials say that meanwhile, they
are trying to gain some control over the crush of refugees.
   However, opposition parties accuse the government of backing away
from its pledge to accept any of the estimated 1.5 million ethnic
Turks who want to leave Bulgaria.
   A Bulgarian immigrant who crossed the border with a valid visa
said thousands of ethnic Turks were waiting on the Bulgarian side,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Wednesday.
   It quoted Ahmet Durmushev as saying the refugees were living ``in
miserable conditions, with little water or food.''

   Diana Vreeland, who reigned over the world of
haute couture for more than three decades, creating trends and
coining the term ``beautiful people,'' was mourned Wednesday as a
fashion original.
   ``She was and remains the only genious fashion editor,'' said
photographer Richard Avedon, who worked with Mrs. Vreeland when she
edited Harper's Bazaar and then Vogue.
   Mrs. Vreeland died Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She had been
in failing health for several years. She was believed to be about 86
years old, but her age remained a mystery _ ``Whatever age you are,
you're older than you ought to be,'' she once said.
   Mrs. Vreeland became a fashion high priestess whose power was
matched by her biting wit and sense of the provocative.
   She popularized the turtleneck sweater, discovered the designer
Halston and was the first to see Jacqueline Kennedy's potential as a
fashion force. She could also be outlandish, advising readers to
turn their old fur coats into bathrobes and wash their blond
children's hair ``in dead champagne.''
   Vreeland aphorisms like ``the bikini is only the most important
invention since the atomic bomb'' were as legendary as her barbs.
   She once called diva Maria Callas' table manners ``as common as
mud'' and said Coco Chanel had the ``expression of a baby bull
dressed like a Prussian sailor.''
   She was born Diana Dalziel into a world of glitter and privilege
in Paris at the turn of the century.
   In 1914, her parents, Scottish banker Frederick Young Dalziel and
Emily Key Dalziel, came to the United States to escape World War I
and set up their household here.
   Mrs. Vreeland had little formal education _ a few months at
prestigious private schools. She studied ballet with Russian
choreographer Michel Fokine and learned to ride horses from William
``Buffalo Bill'' Cody during summers in Wyoming.
   In 1923, she met Thomas Reed Vreeland, a Yale graduate, banker
and impeccable dresser whom she married the following year. He died
in 1966. The couple had two children, Thomas Reed Jr. and Frederick
D. The Vreelands moved to London, where she traveled and met such
notables as Evelyn Waugh and Cole Porter and continued her interest
in dancing by becoming a member of the Tiller girls, a chorus line
used by Florenz Ziegfeld.
   When the couple returned to New York in 1936, Mrs. Vreeland
supplemented her husband's income by working for Harper's Bazaar.
   Over the years, Mrs. Vreeland's influence in the fashion world
became immense and in 1962 she left Harper's to join its archrival,
Vogue. A year later, she became its editor in chief.
   At Vogue, Mrs. Vreeland shaped the look of what she called the
1960s ``youthquake,'' featuring such unconventional models as Marisa
Berenson, Twiggy, and ``Baby Jane'' Holzer.
   Her beautiful people, or BPs, included people of royalty and
wealth. Her favorite fashions included see-through tops, pants for
women, costume jewelry and the peasant look.
   In 1971, Mrs. Vreeland was fired from Vogue when the publisher,
Conde Nast, decided the time had come for a new editor.
   She became a special consultant to the Costume Institute of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she organized shows on Parisian
originals of the early 1900s and Hollywood glamour styles of the
1930s, '40s and '50s.
   A striking figure who wore her black hair swept back severely,
Mrs. Vreeland had a penchant for t-strap shoes and cashmere sweaters
that precisely matched her skirts. The color red that pervaded her
Park Avenue apartment added to an aura of eccentricity.
   Truman Capote called her one of the ``very few great original
women.''
   The story is told that at lunch one day at a well-known
restuarant, Mrs. Vreeland responded to seeing a cockroach on her
table by leaping up and singing ``La Cucaracha.''
   She encouraged the telling of such extravagant anecdotes, saying,
``I need a lot of fanfare, no question about it.''
   She is survived by her sons, four grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren. Funeral plans were private; a public memorial
service was planned for the fall.

<HEAD>Planning Commission Rejects Use of Sub-Surface Lots for Air Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Planning Commission on Wednesday
unanimously rejected a developer's plan to transfer the air rights
above the landmark Grand Central Terminal so he could construct a
74-story building two blocks away.
   It is common practice in New York City to transfer the air rights
from one lot to an adjacent lot. For example, if a building only has
five floors in an area where 10-story buildings are allowed, the
developer of a building next door can buy the unused rights and
construct a 15-story building.
   But air rights can only be used for an adjacent lot or property
across the street, according to the city Law Department.
   The commission said the developer's attempt to trace a chain of
sub-surface lots _ train tunnels going from the terminal to beneath
the proposed building _ did not meet the law.
   Commissioner Sylvia Deutsch also said the proposed building was
too big for the neighborhood.
   The developer of the proposed 74-story building, G. Ware
Travelstead, and Penn Central Corp., owner of the terminal and the
air rights, did not indicate what action they would take until they
studied the commission's report.

   First lady Barbara Bush played tennis
Wednesday and bantered with her husband a day after beginning new
medication for her Graves' disease, then posed cross-eyed for
reporters in mock exaggeration of her condition.
   ``Can we inspect your eyeballs, please?'' President Bush called
to his wife as she enjoyed a spritely game of doubles at the
couple's seaside vacation home.
   She walked to the edge of the court, where the president had
brought a gaggle of reporters and cameras. Mrs. Bush stood with her
hands on her hips and made a bug-eyed face, crossing her eyes toward
her nose.
   ``My eyes are just fine,'' she said, before the president
playfully ran onto the court and tried to put his hand over her
eyes. ``Don't do that,'' he said laughing.
   Asked by reporters how she was feeling, she at first said she was
``just sick about'' her tennis game, then added, ``No, I feel
wonderful.''
   Mrs. Bush on Tuesday was ordered by doctors to begin taking
prednisone, a mild steroid, for eye irritation and double vision
triggered by Graves' disease, a thyroid condition she suffers.
   The thyroid-attacking characteristics of the disease were
arrested by a radioactive iodine treatment she had a few months ago,
but the eye condition had not improved, her office said.
   She interupted her vacation with Bush to return to the doctors in
Washington on Tuesday, but was back that evening.
   The first lady at first acted annoyed with her husband for
bringing reporters to watch her play with partner Betsy Heminway
against daughter-in-law Margaret Bush and cousin Debbie Stapleton.
   The president took on a mischievous air when suggesting to White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
and the reporters that they take a stroll over to the court
following a question-and-answer session in front of the Walker's
Point home.
   ``I thought there were some things George Bush wouldn't stoop
to,'' Mrs. Bush joked.
   Dressed in visor cap and white tennis dress, the first lady
appeared in fine form, vigorously hitting and serving the ball.
   However, the president joshed during serve change between games
that ``it's like watching grass grow out there.''
   He said his wife's eyes already had improved and that the doctors
had said she would get quick relief with the prednisone, a form of
cortisone with fewer side effects.
   Graves' disease results from a mixup in the body's
disease-fighting immune system. The body produces antibodies that
mistakenly attack the thyroid gland as an enemy.
   ``It hasn't interfered with her playing anyway,'' Bush said.
   Tennis, he indicated, is important to the Bushes.
   He told reporters a story about the girlfriend of his sister's
son who learned that.
   Bush's mother, whom he said was a very good player, asked if the
young woman could play tennis and was told she could.
   ``A few days later, Mother watched, and said, `Well, she's a very
nice girl, but she doesn't even play net.'''
   Bush's major lament of the day was that ``the fishing has been
lousy'' in the week that he's been on vacation.
   ``I've fished every single day and haven't got one.''
   When told that an 18-pound bluefish was caught from the ABC-TV
camera boat tht was following his speed boat one day, Bush was
obviously envious.
   ``Eighteen pound bluefish?'' he repeated several times. ``Out
there with us? There's no justice here. That's just not fair.''

<HEAD>Newly Merged Lutherans Meet for First National Assembly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A newly merged denomination, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, headed into its first
national assembly Wednesday seeking a sense of family.
   It also faced specific issues, from proposals for getting rid of
investments in companies doing business in South Africa to
ecumenical relations.
   The 5.3 million-member denomination, formed last year from three
Lutheran groups, is the fourth-largest Protestant body in the
country.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, the church's presiding head, said
the convention should provide a greater ``sense of identity'' so
``people will be able to say we belong together in the same family
of faith.''
   ``It's amazing how quickly that spirit is developing,'' he said
in an interview. ``There's very little looking back to what we
were.''
   The assembly is the first occasion for churchwide action on
policy matters since the denomination began functioning at new
headquarters established here.
   About 2,000 Lutherans, including 1,050 voting delegates, were
present for the opening festive service of Holy Communion and a
robed procession of the church's 65 bishops who head regional synods.
   A huge white panel over the podium carries the theme of this
assembly, ``Many Voices, One Song.''
   The preacher for the occasion was the Rev. Emilio Castro, a
Methodist and general secretary of the World Council of Churches.
   Whether the new denomination should join that council of most
major Protestant and Orthodox denominations, and a similarly
constituted domestic body, the National Council of Churches, was an
issue before the assembly.
   Different stances about it were taken by the predecessor Lutheran
bodies. That, however, is only one of many matters the new church is
to settle as it sets its initial course.
   In a state-of-the-church report, Chilstrom said the early phase
of the church's life has been ``a time of incredible adjustment for
all of us.''
   ``Demands of getting ourselves organized were so great that we
found ourselves reacting more often than acting,'' he said.
   But ``we are now nearing the end of this early transition
period,'' he said, and it's up to the assembly to make ``decisions
that will determine the direction of the church for the years to
come.''
   The denomination was created through merger of the Lutheran
Church in America, the American Lutheran Church and the Association
of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, the first two themselves products
of earlier mergers.
   Lutherans in this country once were divided into more than a
score of different denominations, mainly distinguished by the German
or Scandinavian nationalities from which they stemmed.
   The new body has set a goal of becoming at least 10 percent
ethnic minority members by the end of its first decade.
   The eight-day convention runs through next Wednesday, with
financial matters a worrisome concern, including a $15.8 million
shortfall in anticipated revenues last year for a $99.3 million
national budget. Altogether, members contributed $1.1 billion last
year, most of it used for congregational expenses and local
charities.

   The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay says
government workers should be given a pay increase of 10 percent next
year to help narrow the gap between their salaries and those paid to
counterparts in the private sector.
   ``The bottom line on federal pay is that the gap has become a
canyon,'' said Martin L. Duggan, the committee's chairman, in
releasing its latest annual report.
   He pointed to figures issued two weeks ago by the President's Pay
Agent _ an interagency group involving officials of the Labor
Department, Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management
and Budget _ showing that the pay gap has now grown to 28.6 percent.
   Duggan said that ``we commend the president and Congress for
granting a 3.6 percent increase to become effective in January 1990,
but the committee believes that an additional 6.4 percent is
needed.''
   ``This would send a strong and clear message to young people, who
would not consider a public service career, that the government is
serious about recruiting well-qualified people,'' he said in issuing
the report Tuesday.
   Duggan added that ``the absence of adequate pay increases over
the past decade is driving out the capable people who are already in
the federal government.''
   In addition to the pay raise recommendation, the panel's report
calls for phasing in further increases to remove the pay gap over a
four-year period; reforming the pay system by making salaries more
responsive to labor market conditions; redesigning the health care
benefit program to provide more cost-efficient coverage; and
updating the government's benefits package to better compete for
skills in the labor market.
   Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives
Association, representing top career federal executives, called the
advisory committee's report ``right on target'' in urging the pay
increase.
   She noted that the pay gap tends to be greater at upper levels of
government service, with GS-15s falling 36.7 percent behind their
private sector counterparts.
   ``This is even more strong evidence that senior federal
executives above that level are grossly undercompensated,'' Ms.
Bonosaro said.
   John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, AFL-CIO, commented that ``as a result of the
continued imposition of pay caps, beginning in 1978, the federal
government has found itself in an untenable position, with inferior,
non-competitive salaries in a nationally tight labor market.''
   ``Failure to begin to remedy the current pay gap will virtually
ensure that the nation's largest employer will remain the employer
of last resort,'' Sturdivant said.
   AFGE is the largest union for government workers, representing
700,000 federal employees in the United States and overseas.

<HEAD>U.S. Education Department Rules Music School Discriminated Against
Blind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until this year, blind students who enrolled at one
of the nation's largest independent music schools were told that no
matter what their academic record, they could never graduate.
   Berklee College of Music required students to learn to sight-read
sheet music, making it impossible for the 2,900-student
undergraduate school's few blind students to get a degree.
   The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights
recently ruled that Berklee discriminated against the blind, giving
blind students a chance to get a diploma from the school as well as
an education.
   ``This means something to all blind people, not just the
musically inclined,'' Kenneth Jernigan, executive director of the
50,000-member National Federation for the Blind in Baltimore, said
Wednesday. ``Every time a chip of prejudice is cut away, it helps.''
   Officials at the 44-year-old downtown Boston school have
struggled with the issue for years, said its dean, Lawrence Bethune.
   The sight-reading requirement is tailored to Berklee's reputation
for training students to be able to undertake any musical
assignment, Bethune said. Other schools, such as Juilliard in New
York, train students in a more classical mode, he said.
   Berklee is almost like a trade school, Bethune said. ``The
hardest thing is to teach people to be able to function as a
musician, to make a living from music, for 30 years. At Juilliard,
if you learn the oboe part for Beethoven's Fifth, it's never going
to change. It'll always be the same piece of music.''
   Students with a Berklee degree should be able to walk in any
studio ``and lay down a guitar track with Madonna or play a cut with
Tony Bennett'' and be capable of improvising from whatever sheet
music is used, he said.
   Jernigan disagreed: ``The problem is that sight reading is not
totally relevant to playing music. ... I guess it means that Berklee
wouldn't let Stevie Wonder in.''
   Bethune said no more than a few blind students have studied at
Berklee in his 20 years there.
   The case began two years ago when a visually impaired woman
decided to apply to Berklee and was told she would not graduate. Her
mother filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights.
   The office ruled against the school June 29, concluding that
qualified blind students should not be held back based on their
inability to perform a single test.
   The woman, who has not been identified, did not attend Berklee,
and has not reapplied, Bethune said.
   A Berklee curriculum committee had been looking at the core
requirements before the ruling, and had decided to change the sight
reading requirement irrespective of the discrimination case, Bethune
said.
   The ruling was non-binding, but would have put the issue in court
had Berklee not acted.
   Neither Bethune, Jernigan or officials at the Office of Civil
Rights said they knew of a sight-reading policy such as Berklee's.
   The 800-student Juilliard School modifies its requirements for
visually impaired students, said Assistant Dean Karen Wagner. ``They
certainly haven't been held up for graduation because they couldn't
see,''she said.

   Hungarian guards used dogs to tighten
border control, but 250 East Germans still reached Austria overnight
in the tide of escape from their repressive communist homeland,
witnesses said Wednesday.
   Border guards thwarted what appeared to be a mass crossing by
intercepting three buses from Budapest near Lake Neusiedl, which
straddles the border, sources said. They said 300 East Germans were
in the buses.
   Austrian officials and witnesses said only about 30 East Germans
arrived Wednesday. Witnesses at the Klingenbach crossing in Austria
said they saw Hungarian border guards turn back nearly 20 East
German cars.
   Arriving East Germans said Hungarian authorities had begun
checking groups of East German tourists in areas away from the
border to try to discourage any who might be contemplating escape.
   In Bonn, a newspaper said that East Germany is planning to impose
strict new travel regulations to Hungary to stem the flow of
refugees.
   The Die Welt newspaper, quoting unidentified Western diplomatic
sources in East Berlin, said East German officials plan to
drastically restrict travel to Hungary by Sept. 1.
   The newspaper said visa applications for Hungary are already
being given strict scrutiny. It said only official trips and visits
by trusted party members are being allowed.
   The report, given in advance to other news media, was to appear
in the newspaper's Thursday edition.
   Flight from East Germany through Hungary started in May, after
the liberal communist regime in Budapest began removing barbed wire
and other obstacles from its border with Austria. Permission to
visit the West is rare for East Germans, but they can travel to
neighboring Hungary with ease.
   West Germany's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday about 3,300 East
Germans had arrived via Austria so far this month, 2,000 of those in
the past four days.
   An Associated Press reporter watching the frontier near
Moerbisch, on the Austrian side, said Hungarian guards were
patrolling at intervals of about 130 feet. Some had dogs.
   They were covering a stretch of about 2{ miles where many East
Germans had crossed.
   Journalists and other observers at the border said the influx was
down to a trickle at 6 a.m. Wednesday. More than 500 East Germans
crossed the previous day.
   One young refugee said of his reasons for fleeing: ``Food and
drink is okay in East Germany, housing is poor, and the rest you can
forget.''
   Another said: ``There is nothing you can decide freely. You must
always ask if you may. Then they say yes or no, but you are never
told why it's no.''
   A 23-year-old man from East Berlin said he scaled border fences
12 times before being certain he was in Austria. He said the
meandering frontier and his unfamiliarity with the terrain had
confused him.
   A refugee from Freiberg, 21, said it took him 27 hours to
complete his successful escape.
   Scores of Austrian citizens who know the border area, and West
German tourists with detailed maps, are known to help East Germans
cross the border.
   ``I don't know their names; they don't know my name,'' said a
West German who helps refugees. ``You've got to help these people.''
   Most volunteer their services, but the fees of guides who charge
range up to nearly $500 in West German marks.
   Villagers in Austria help new arrivals by providing showers, food
and closting.
   ``This assistance comes unsolicited and is spontaneous,'' a
police official said. The local government in Austria's Burgenland
border province has not become involved in relief efforts.
   Shuttle buses provided by West Germany take refugees to Vienna,
where they are provided with the necessary papers to continue their
journey.
   In Budapest, the Communist Party daily newspaper Nepszabasag
published an interview with the border guard involved in the death
Monday of East German refugee Kurt Werner Schulz, 36, who was shot
50 feet inside Austria.
   The 20-year-old border guard said his gun went off during a
scuffle with Schulz.

   House and Senate Democratic leaders said
Wednesday they want equal television network time to respond to
President Bush's presentation of the administration's proposal to
combat drugs.
   ``We hereby request equal time immediately following tyhe
president's address for live response to his speech,'' said a letter
to network presidents and bureau chiefs from Senate Majority Leader
George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   Bush is due to unveil his strategy for fighting drugs Sept. 5.
   The Democratic leaders said in their letter, dated Monday and
made public Wednesday, that the networks in past years ``have
provided the opposition party with opportunities to present
congressional views of the issues confronting the president and
Congress.''
   ``We and other members of Congress have appreciated these
opportunities beause we believe this practice reflects a recognition
that Congress is a co-equal branch of the federal government with
equal responsibility for determining policy,'' they said.

   A hospital supervisor went on trial Wednesday in the
slaying 22 years ago of a 76-year-old woman who lived alone.
   Bob Reilly, head of the orthopedic services department at Baptist
Hospital, was arrested in 1987 when Metro-Dade police assigned to a
``cold-case'' squad came up with evidence implicating him.
   Robert Ball Jr., a salesman from Las Vegas, told investigators
that Reilly and a man now believed to be dead beat, bound and gagged
Josephine Barnhill, 76, on March 29, 1967. She died later.
   ``They needed money,'' Ball testified Tuesday. ``They wanted a
score, that is, to rob somebody.''
   Ball pleaded guilty to manslaughter as the getaway driver. His
sentence will hinge on his testimony at Reilly's trial.
   Reilly, who is charged with first-degree murder, spent seven
years in prison for robbery. He was paroled in 1973 and became a
model citizen.
   Sixty-three friends and co-workers filled a courtroom to urge his
release after his arrest at work, and supporters recalled how he
broke up a knife fight at the hospital.

<HEAD>Bush: Soviet Leader Would Find Home in Maine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wouldn't say Wednesday
whether he'd consider inviting Mikhail Gorbachev to his vacation
home, but Bush was sure the Soviet leader would take to the seacoast
town. ``Everybody likes it,'' he declared.
   The president took a break from his boating, golf and tennis to
field questions from Maine reporters on the lawn of his vacation
home, discussing everything from world events to the price of
lobster.
   But he sidestepped a question on whether he would ever invite
Gorbachev to join him at his Maine retreat.
   ``Well, he'd be welcome,'' said Bush, who is here on a three-week
vacation that runs through Labor Day.
   ``Do you think he'd like it?'' Bush was asked.
   ``Who couldn't like it? Yes. Everybody likes it.''
   Asked if the average Mainer could afford to have a vacation like
his, the president responded: ``I don't think so. I'm very
privileged and lucky in that regard. But I also don't think the
average Mainer begrudges me a vacation of any kind.''
   The president was stumped when one reporter asked, ``Mr.
President, what do you think a fair price for a pound of lobster
is?''
   ``I don't know. Can't give it to you.''
   Bush was also asked to reflect on his first seven months in
office, and to comment on his high acceptance level reflected by
public opinion polls.
   ``Some of it is my wife. Some of it is the fact, I think, people
see that we're trying hard. It's fundamental values. Some of it is
that I've tried to calm things down and work with Congress.''
   ``But these things change. You know, these polls _ look, you're
looking at a guy who was standing on this lawn about a year ago at
this time and ... the numbers were quite different ... What goes up
can come down, and I'm well aware of that.''
   He admitted the White House trappings that have caused traffic
headaches for town residents have also made his summer in
Kennebunkport different from years past.
   ``What bothers me a little bit is that you just can't jump in the
car over there and drive downtown or something of that nature,'' he
said. ``But that goes with the territory.''

<HEAD>Wildlife Federation Takes Its Case To Appeals Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Wildlife Federation, escalating
the legal fight over protecting endangered sea turtles from the nets
of Gulf Coast shrimp fisherman, took its case to a federal appeals
court Wednesday.
   Rebuffed by a U.S. District Court judge on Tuesday, the
federation asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to reinstate a law that
requires shrimpers to use devices that let turtles escape from their
nets.
   The federation sought an emergency injunction to ``ensure the
continued survival of the severely endangered Kemp's ridley sea
turtle and four other sea turtle species listed as threatened or
endangered.''
   The federation is challenging Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher's decision allowing shrimpers to limit trawling time to
105 minutes in lieu of turtle excluder devices, or TEDs.
   Under the 105-minute limit, shrimpers can have their nets in the
water for 90 minutes, the length of time some officials claim a sea
turtle can survive while submerged. The regulations give shrimpers
another 7{ minutes to get their nets in the water and 7{ minutes to
remove them.
   Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the TEDs regulations July 24,
after a weekend of protests by shrimpers who claim the devices
reduce their catch and threaten their livelihood.
   ``According to the biological opinion of the secretary's own
scientists, the substitution of a limited tow time for required TED
use in the midst of the shrimping season will result in the deaths
of thousands of threatened and endangered sea turtles in the Gulf
and the Atlantic,'' the federation said in its appeal.
   The temporary regulations, drafted under a court order by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Hogan, are in effect through Sept. 8, when
Mosbacher must issue final rules.
   Mosbacher issued the temporary regulations after the wildlife
federation filed suit and Hogan ruled the turtles were being left
totally unprotected.
   But federation claims that National Marine Fisheries Service
scientists have concluded the 105-minute plan ``will jeopardize the
continued existence of five threatened and endangered species of sea
turtles.''
   Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman said the final rules due out
Sept. 8 are still under consideration.

<HEAD>Argentine Leader Says Debt Endangers Latin Stability and Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem of Argentine told
a joint session of Brazil's Congress on Wednesday that Latin
America's $400 billion foreign debt puts the region's political
stability in serious danger.
   He urged Latin countries to unite to ``acquire a new voice in the
world.''
   ``There aren't many options,'' he said. ``Either we work out a
joint strategy in line with our development needs, or we will be the
objects of outside stragtegies.''
   Menem is in Brazil on his first major foreign trip since taking
office in July. He arrived Tuesday for talks with President Jose
Sarney of Brazil and Uruguay's President Julio Maria Sanguinetti in
Uruguaiana, a city on the border with Argentina.
   Brazil and Argentina both have civilian administrations that
replaced military dictatorships and both are battling runaway
inflation.
   They have the developing world's first and third-largest foreign
debts, respectively. Brazil's is $112 billion and Argentina's is $56
billion. Mexico is in between them with more than $100 billion.
   ``Democratic Argentina realizes the necessity of continuing the
process of integration with its neighbors and strengthening Latin
American unity,'' Menem said.
   He added that it was time for Latin nations to decide whether to
seek ``a reasonable voice'' on the world stage or ``to continue
living inside the old provincial molds.''
   Menem maintained that a path of regional integration, following a
model started by Brazil and Argentina in 1985, could lead to a more
efficient and equitable role for Latin America in the world economy.
   Since lowering certain customs duties and eliminating some trade
restrictions, Brazil and Argentina, have doubled their mutual
imports and exports, to $1.7 billion. The two countries have
encouraged their small Uruguay to join them in a common market.

   Hundreds of thousands of Baltic
residents linked hands Wednesday to form a human chain across their
tiny homelands, a defiant repudiation of Soviet rule on the 50th
anniversary of their lost sovereignty.
   Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians took up spots along a
370-mile route from the Gulf of Finland south to the Lithuanian
capital of Vilnius to demand that Moscow grant more freedom and
admit it annexed their republics by force.
   Organizers said they expected 1.5 million people, about one-fifth
of the Baltic republics' 8 million residents, to link hands. Initial
indications were that more than 1 million took part.
   The official Soviet news agency, Tass, said 300,000 people joined
hands in Estonia and nearly 500,000 in Lithuania. In Latvia,
People's Front officials said 400,000 participated.
   After decades of denials, Soviet officials have admitted that a
secret deal between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler deeded control of
the Baltic states to the Kremlin. But they maintain the nations
voluntarily joined the Soviet Union.
   In Moscow, police arrested 75 people demonstrating in support of
the Baltic residents.
   In Vilnius, about 5,000 people gathered in Cathedral Square,
holding candles and singing the song that was Lithuania's national
anthem until Stalin's tanks rolled into Lithuania and the other
Baltic states in 1940.
   Grazina Staniute, a 15-year-old Lithuanian student from Kaunas,
said the candles ``symbolize those who died in exile. When we light
the candles, they will be with us.''
   Brone Surzilate, 58, one of those exiled under Stalin as the
Communists set up a Soviet regime, held a card with the number
1,222,660. She said that was the number of Lithuanians that
activists estimate have suffered repression under Soviet rule.
   In the southern Soviet republic of Moldavia, which also was
absorbed by the Soviet Union at the same time, 10,000 people turned
out in a heavy rain for a two-hour outdoor rally, said Moldavian
People's Front spokesman Yuri Rozhgo.
   In this port city on the Gulf of Finland, the human chain began
at a wind-whipped medieval tower where Estonian Premier Indrik Toome
and other leaders headed the line of unity.
   ``We are proclaiming to each other and to the whole world that we
in the Baltic nations have never given up our freedom,'' Heinz Valk,
a leader of the grassroots Estonian People's Front, said.
   Lines of tens of thousands of solemn-faced Estonians, their hands
clasped and four deep in places, stretched from the tower as far as
the eye could see. ``Vabadus,'' they said, passing the Estonian word
for ``freedom'' down the line.
   The line was to snake southward through several cities, including
the Latvian capital of Riga, and end in the Lithuanian capital.
   The chain climaxed a series of protests marking the anniversary
of the Aug. 23, 1939, non-aggression treaty between Soviet Union and
Nazi Germany.
   Organizers said the human chain would symbolize the Baltic
peoples' solidarity in their struggle for more autonomy _ and
possibly eventual independence _ from Moscow.
   The more liberal political climate introduced by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has allowed Baltic residents to voice demands
that as recently as last year would have meant arrest or exile.
   However, in Moscow, police broke up what authorities said was an
unauthorized demonstration by the Democratic Union, a self-styled
opposition to the Communist Party, that activists said was called to
denounce the Hitler-Stalin pact.
   Seventy-five people were detained near Pushkin Square for
breaching the peace, resisting police and petty hooliganism after
Democratic Union leaders climbed on telephone booths and lampposts,
the Tass news agency said.
   The Soviet TV news program ``Vremya,'' in the first comment by
Moscow-based media on the extraordinary Baltic protest, said it
would be ``political naivete'' to believe Europe's borders can be
redrawn now.
   The United States and some other Western countries do not
recognize the Baltic republics as parts of the Soviet Union,
maintaining they are ``captive nations.'' Baltic emigre regimes have
their own embassies in Washington.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
reiterated the U.S. policy of not recognizing Soviet annexation of
the Baltic republics. ``We firmly support the peaceful efforts of
the Baltic peoples to regain control over their own political and
economic destiny,'' he said.
   Earlier in Vilnius, about 200 members of 17 radical Lithuanian
political groups marched about a half-mile to Mountain Park, where
they burned a two-headed effigy of Hitler and Stalin. Both the
dictators' mouths dripped with blood.
   Hitler and Stalin ``drank the blood of Lithuania from one glass,
and then started to eat each other,'' Jonas Mugevicius, leader of
the Lithuanian Democratic Party, told about 4,000 people who
attended the rally.
   About 170 leaders of the grassroots Lithuanian group Sajudis, who
also met in Vilnius, voted to call for ``the creation of an
independent democratic Lithuanian republic not under the power of
the Soviet Union.''
   That rhetoric showed how far Baltic militants have come from last
fall when their vaguely worded demands of ``sovereignty'' were bold.
   In a secret protocol to the 1939 treaty signed by their foreign
ministers Joachim von Ribbentrop and Vyacheslav Molotov, Hitler and
Stalin carved Eastern Europe into ``spheres of influence.'' The
Baltic republics fell into the Soviet sphere and became a World War
II battleground.
   A commission of the national Soviet parliament, the Congress of
People's Deputies, recently ruled the authenticity of the secret
protocol had to be recognized and recommended the legislature
declare it invalid.
   The commission's report, published Tuesday in Estonia, marked a
big step forward from former Soviet denials the secret agreement
ever existed.
   However, it did not acknowledge that the division of Eastern
Europe made by the pact led to the Soviet annexation of the Baltic
states. The Kremlin still maintains the three states voluntarily
joined the Soviet Union.

   Fire destroyed the remains of the last
whaling station in the United States.
   The fire at the abandoned wooden warehouse on pilings at Point
San Pablo, 10 miles inside San Francisco Bay, began Tuesday night.
   ``It's gone to the waterline,'' Richmond Fire Battalion Chief
James Fajardo said Wednesday.
   The Del Monte Fishing Co. opened a whaling business in the
building in the 1950s. In 1971, prodded by ecologists, the federal
government silenced the harpoon cannons of Del Monte's three
103-foot vessels, by then the last American whaling ships.
   The brand name of Del Monte's principal product, used mainly for
poultry and cattle feed, was ``Moby Dick 100 Percent Whale Meat.''
Its logo was a blowing, grinning whale.
   The business stuck in the craw of whale lovers who protested the
suffering and decimation of the herds of sperms, finbacks and seis
Del Monte hunted.
   Del Monte killed 109 of the 21,500 whales taken worldwide in
1969, the company's last manager, Charles Caito, said when the
station closed.
   In the 1840s, the U.S. whaling fleet numbered 750 vessels. It was
a multi-million dollar industry, providing oil fuel for lighting and
cooking in tens of thousands of American homes and inspiring stories
of great courage, like Herman Melville's classic 1851 novel, ``Moby
Dick.''
   The surging petroleum industry and the sinking of many whaling
ships by Confederate warships during the Civil War sent whaling into
a decline. After the war, only 260 whalers were left, and by the
turn of the century, the number had dwindled to 40.
   American whaling ended in 1971 when U.S. Commerce Secretary
Maurice Stans issued a ban aimed at preserving threatened species.

<HEAD>NTSB Recommends New Safety Devices on Airliner Cargo Doors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board on
Wednesday recommended the use of redundant ``fail-safe'' mechanisms
on airliner cargo door latches to prevent the doors from popping
open in flight and assure they are properly closed before takeoffs.
   The NTSB said its investigation of an apparent cargo door failure
last February in which nine people aboard a United Airlines flight
were killed shows that the original design of the doors on Boeing
747 models ``does not provide for the fail-safe features intended.''
   ``One single failure can lead to the door being apparently
closed, latched and locked, yet it can be unlatched or can become
unlatched, and neither the ground personnel nor the flight crew
would be aware of its unsafe condition,'' the agency said.
   In a seven-page safety recommendation to the Federal Aviation
Administration, the NTSB said airliners should have redundant
indicators to directly pinpoint the position of latch cams on the
cargo doors.
   The board also said torque-limiting devices should be installed
on both the manual and electrical drives for cargo door latchs to
prevent damage to the lock mechanisms during their operation.
   While saying it has not determined the cause of the Feb. 24
accident over the Pacific Ocean, the board said the evidence
``strongly suggests that the forward cargo door opened in flight and
led to the subsequent damage.''
   Passengers were sucked out of a hole in the plane's fuselage.
   Yet to be determined, the board said, is whether the cargo door
was not latched or only partially latched before takeoff or if it
became unlatched for some reason.

<HEAD>Tons of Food Awaits Distribution to Hungry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a million pounds of food for the
hungry is stacked 18 feet high in a warehouse, its distribution to
outlying parts of the state delayed for lack of money, transport
vehicles and volunteer help, some state officials say.
   ``We've gotten the people to give us the food _ the problem is we
don't have the means to get it to the people who need it, and there
are people starving out there,'' said state Rep. Alyce Clarke of
Jackson, a board member of the state-run Mississippi Food Network.
   The stored food, donated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
includes dried beans, instant potatoes, canned pork and citrus
juices. Perishables including dairy products and frozen meats have
been delivered before spoiling.
   Network board members say the agency lacks large transport
vehicles and enough drivers to deliver the food more than 150 miles
to poor counties in the Mississippi Delta and far northern parts of
the state.
   ``We can't get the food to Tunica County and Tishomingo County
where people need it,'' said Jo Ann Gilder Alford, the food bank's
director of development and public relations.
   But the food bank's executive director, Jesse Morris, disagreed
with other assessments of the agency's problem.
   He said USDA food is going on schedule to the network's 150
member agencies, which buy the food for 12 cents a pound, but
distribution would be made easier if the food bank had another
warehouse in northern Mississippi.
   ``The food is going out,'' Morris said. ``The problem is we need
a building'' in north Mississippi.
   This year the network distributed 1.5 million pounds of food, or
about 2.5 million meals.
   But because the agency does not have space in its warehouses for
the surplus food, it has leased private storage at a cost of $1,800
a month.
   The burden on the network is increased because many of its member
agencies lack vehicles and manpower to pick up the food in Jackson,
board members said.
   ``We're trying to open a branch in north Mississippi so we can
better serve the state,'' said board member Rims Barber of Jackson.
   ``This food all came in in a rush and we are trying to get it out
in an orderly manner,'' Barber said. ``The food is going out (to
member agencies), but it is going out slower than we would like it
to.''

pact signed 50 years ago that opened the way for World War II.
   Legislators passed the resolution 349-0 in the Sejm, or lower
house of parliament, as several hundred protesters marched through
the streets of Warsaw and three other cities to mark the anniversary
of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact.
   ``The pact was not only shameful from the moral point of view but
also in violation of the basic principles of international law and
thus from the very beginning null and void,'' said the resolution,
introduced by Solidarity lawmakers who comprise 35 percent of the
chamber.
   Solidarity Deputy Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who introduced the
resolution, said the Aug. 23, 1939 pact opened the way for Hitler to
attack Poland just eight days later.
   ``All people in Poland know that this pact made it possible and
helped Hitler to carry out his various political plans,'' said
Onyszkiewicz. ``In particular, it made it easier for him to invade
Poland.
   ``It also made it easier for Stalin to carry out his aspirations
toward various European countries, let me name here only Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.''
   In a reference to the Soviet Union, which for many years denied
the key secret provisions of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact,
Onyszkiewicz said Poland wants relations with its neighbors to be
``based on respect ... And based on truth.''
   ``This is the purpose the statement is supposed to serve,'' he
said.
   At the protest march in central Warsaw, meanwhile, a speaker from
Youth Solidarity called for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe, a declaration of independence by states swallowed by
the Soviet Union and independence for the different ethnic groups in
that country.
   The state news agency PAP said there were also demonstrations in
northern Szczecin, western Pozanan and southern Katowice.
   Youths threw coins and firebombs at police and placed anti-Soviet
slogans at a Soviet monument in Szczecin, the agency said.
   Demonstrators in Warsaw, held up banners saying ``Soviets Go
Home,'' ``Enough of Pacts with Reds.''
   Police stood at a distance watching the Warsaw protest, held at
Constitution Square, on the anniversary of the treaty that resulted
in loss of sovereignty for the three Baltic republics of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
   Among the groups present at the demonstration were ``Youth
Solidarity,'' ``Fighting Solidarity,'' a splinter faction of the
trade union, and the banned Polish Socialist Party.
   The treaty by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and
German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop contained a secret
protocol that set a friendly border running through what was then
the Polish Republic.
   On Monday, the Polish Communist Party Politburo condemned the
protocol, saying it represented a ``flagrant violation'' of
international law.
   Last week, a Soviet Communist Party Politburo member admitted for
the first time the secret pact existed, but he denied that the it
bearing on the Baltic states' current legal status.

   A runaway heavy crane careened down four
city blocks Wednesday, sideswiping or crushing 11 cars then crashing
and burning, pinning the operator inside.
   Police, firefighters and rescue workers worked almost an hour to
free Angelo Sulla, 45. He had cuts on his face and right wrist and
complained of leg pain and nausea.
   Sulla, an employee of Farley Iron Works at Archbald, was listed
in guarded but stable condition at Community Medical Center.
   Authorities speculated brake failure caused the accident.
   The crane sideswiped one car parked on the north side of the
street and clipped off a tree and a utility pole before coming to
rest atop two parked cars.
   The entangled wreckage of a car and a pickup truck sat next to
the crane. Three cars in an apartment house parking lot were damaged
by the crane boom.
   Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. cut off electricity to the
neighborhood for safety reasons after the accident, according to
local manager Rich Beasley. About 1,200 customers lost power for
about two hours.
   Paul Baltrusaitis of Peckville told police he was looking for a
day-care center when the rig turned a corner and apparently lost its
brakes.
   ``We pulled up to the intersection and he was passing us from
left to right,'' said Jack Kudrack of South Plainfield, N.J.
``Another 10 seconds sooner and we would have been under that.''
   Kudrack said he stopped at an intersection and saw the crane
speed past. He estimated the truck was traveling 40 mph to 50 mph
when it crossed the intersection.
   ``The vehicle left the ground,'' Kudrack said. ``I never saw
anything like that.''

   The Federal Trade Commission has ruled that the
New England Motor Rate Bureau illegally fixed rates charged by
carriers hauling goods in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the
agency said Wednesday.
   By a 3-1 vote, the commission made the finding and ordered the
Boston-based bureau to halt its collective ratemaking activities in
most states and to cancel within six months all tariffs it has filed
in those states.
   The commission had originally charged NEMRB and its member
carriers in 1983, saying that they hindered competition in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire.
   The opinion noted that in Massachusetts, the state Department of
Public Utilities did not exercise its supervisory authority over
rates, subjecting the NEMRB's collective ratepaying to federal
``antitrust scrutiny.''
   New Hampshire neither reviews rates nor has the authority to
suspend or reject rates, the FTC noted.
   In Rhode Island, however, the laws met the federal requirements
for being exempt from federal antitrust regulation.
   NEMRB offices were closed, and no representative could be
identified to reach after hours for comment.

<TEXT>
   Syria's militia allies said Wednesday a
French flotilla assembling near Lebanon was ``an act of aggression''
and they would shell any warships that approached the coast.
   Syria has computerized radar capable of detecting ships and
providing target data for long-range artillery, but the militias do
not.
   Christian and Syrian forces fought sporadic duels in and around
Beirut in the artillery war that began March 8. Police said one
person was killed and 15 were wounded, bringing the total to 790
killed and 2,205 wounded.
   Nearly all casualties have been civilians in the battle between
the 20,000-man Christian army command of Gen. Michel Aoun and the
Moslem alliance led by the Syrians, whose 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon
control 70 percent of its territory.
   An Algerian emigre being expelled from France hijacked an Air
France jetliner and, after it landed in Algiers, demanded an
international conference on Lebanon. None of the 102 passengers and
13 crew members was hurt.
   Foreign ministers of the European Community, of which France is
the current president, called for an immediate cease-fire in Lebanon
and said they would send a fact-finding mission to Beirut. The U.N.
Security Council passed a truce resolution Aug. 15 and fighting
abated, but did not stop.
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is sending key aide
Jean-Claude Aime to the region. He said Aime will arrive Friday, in
Rabat, Morocco, to confer with an Arab League committee that has
been trying in vain to arrange a lasting cease-fire in Lebanon and
work out a political solution to the civil war.
   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, urged the Arab League to hold a summit immediately and
send Arab peacekeeping troops to Lebanon, the weekly Al-Hawadess
reported.
   ``If Lebanon collapses, that will be the end of the Arab
League,'' Zayed was quoted as saying in an interview with the
London-based weekly. It was distributed by the official Emirates
news agency.
   The Syrians are in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate issued in 1976, when the Lebanese civil war was a year old.
They consider Lebanon in their sphere of influence and vetoed
proposals to send Arab troops made during an Arab League summit in
May.
   Soviet envoy Gennady Terrosov arrived in Damascus on Wednesday
and met with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, official Syrian
media reported. Syria is Moscow's main ally in the Middle East.
   France has sent six ships to the eastern Mediterranean, led by
the aircraft carrier Foch carrying nearly 2,000 marines.
   President Francois Mitterrand's government says they are on a
humanitarian mission, to evacuate the 7,000 French nationals in
Lebanon if necessary. France governed Lebanon under mandate from the
end of World War I until 1943.
   The flotilla was originally to consist of eight vessels, but
French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said on Wednesday
that six were being sent.
   The Lebanese Nationalist Front, a grouping of 11 pro-Syrian
factions, said in a statement the French were committing ``an act of
aggression directed against the people of Lebanon and the nation's
sovereignty and independence.''
   It said the front's estimated 10,000 combatants had been put on
alert, with orders to ``deter violently such an aggression.''
   ``Any French naval presence off the Lebanese coast will be
shelled,'' the statement said, and France will be ``held fully
responsible for the repercussions resulting from any act of
aggression.''
   After a meeting with Cabinet ministers Wednesday, Mitterrand
said: ``No country or group can dictate to France what it should do
in Lebanon.''
   Aoun said in an interview with the French daily France-Soir he
had received ``little munitions from Iraq, as well as from France,''
in the past two months.
   He also was quoted as saying: ``I expect (the French ships) to be
put at my disposition to assure freedom of movement in territorial
waters.''
   Iraq, Syria's chief Arab foe, is the main arms supplier to
Christian forces.
   In Paris, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry denied supplying
arms.
   Aoun's soldiers and 1 million Christian civilians are bottled up
in a 310-square-mile enclave north and east of Beirut whose only
outlets are ports on the Christian-held coast north of the capital.
Syrian gunners reguarly shell the coast to keep supply ships from
landing.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister-designate Tadeusz Mazowiecki
indicated Wednesday he would find more spots in his government for
the Communist Party, offering compromise the day before he is to be
elected the East bloc's first non-communist head of government.
   At parliamentary caucuses, Mazowiecki stressed it could be risky
not to reach agreement with the communists _ especially when they
still control the army and security police.
   Mazowiecki's olive branch followed communist demands for a full
coalition partnership role. He made clear that offering the party
such a role was realistic.
   ``One cannot today form a government in Poland other than a broad
coalition having the support of all forces sitting at the Sejm,'' he
told Solidarity lawmakers.
   But he also said he could not afford to give the communists too
much.
   ``We cannot allow the political forces which I represent and
which nominated me as their candidate to be pushed into being
(merely) symbolic things,'' he later told an evening caucus of the
lawmakers from the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party _
the two minor parties in the Solidarity coalition.
   The remarks came one day after a 40-minute telephone talk between
Polish Communist Party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in which the two agreed it was
``impossible'' to have a government without the communists.
   The call by Gorbachev, also head of the Communist Party, was the
first direct comment on the events in Poland. It was highly unusual
for the Polish party to publicize such a telephone conversation,
announcing it at a news conference.
   The publicity given the call appeared meant to stress the Soviet
Union's interest in having a strong communist presence in Poland's
next government, but also that the communists should reach an
accommodation with the Solidarity-led coalition.
   President Bush praised Gorbachev's position Wednesday, calling it
``a positive sign.''
   ``There will be bumps in the road as these countries move toward
more democracy,'' Bush said. ``But I feel the statement I saw
attributed to Mr. Gorbachev was very positive in this regard _
very.''
   There were signs Wednesday that both sides in Poland are nearing
an understanding.
   Mazowiecki said it might be a mistake to offer the Communist
Party only the key ministries of defense and interior _ controlling
the army and the police _ that had been promised in the first stages
of negotiating the historic transition to the East bloc's first
government led by non-communists.
   ``Pushing the Communist Party into total negation would be a trap
for the country,'' he said.
   Hinting the party would eventually take back power by force
unless a compromise was reached, he said, ``No opposition in the
world which ... has the army and security services ... remains the
opposition.''
   Mazowiecki, nominated for prime minister Saturday by communist
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, is to be approved for the office when
the Sejm, or lower house, meets Thursday.
   He was proposed by a coalition assembled by Lech Walesa of
Solidarity and the Peasants and Democrats _ the two minor parties
that have a majority in the chamber even without the communists.
   The communists have insisted on a number of places in the
government to correspond to their ``state and political potential.''
   Mazowiecki said he could not say how many of the 19 government
ministries would be offered the communists, or to Solidarity and the
two minor parties. He said he plans to present a government within a
week.
   Aleksander Bentkowski, parliamentary leader of the Peasants, said
the communists want at least one deputy premiership and three
ministries. A Solidarity lawmaker, Artur Balazs, said the party
wanted a deputy premiership, four ministries and the office that
controls state radio and television.
   Communist Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said that Mazowiecki's
envoy, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, had his first talks Tuesday with party
Central Committee Secretary Leszek Miller. Bisztyga refused to
comment on the party's demands.
   Mazowiecki said there are no specific decisions, but it must be a
``broad coalition.''
   Mazowiecki told the Solidarity lawmakers that he had Jaruzelski's
assurance the army and security forces would cooperate with a
government led by the opposition movement they had long sought to
repress.
   He also took a mild stance toward the removal of party loyalists
from state jobs. He said he plans no ``witch hunts'' and his only
criteria would be ``competence and loyalty to the new government.''

<TEXT>
   The government's $73 million settlement with
neighbors of the Fernald uranium processing plant snagged Wednesday
in a disagreement over whether the terms would prevent future
lawsuits involving cleanup costs.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel will decide whether to
approve the settlement.
   The judge described the Energy Department's position as
``inconsistent,'' and said he wanted to hear from Energy Secretary
James Watkins. ``At that time, we'll find out just what's going
on,'' Spiegel said.
   Spiegel suggested he could question Watkins next week.
   The snag surfaced after lawyers for both sides urged Spiegel to
approve the settlement, which would end a class-action lawsuit filed
on behalf of 14,000 residents near the Feed Materials Production
Center, which is owned by the Energy Department.
   The residents contended they suffered emotional distress and that
property values were diminished by radioactive pollution from the
plant, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   The two sides agreed to the settlement after a jury in a mock
trial found in favor of the residents.
   The government agreed last month to give the residents $73
million, and perhaps $5 million more, to cover costs of regular
medical testing and a medical study for residents, their emotional
distress and depressed land values.
   Only one resident objected to the settlement as inadequate, but
three businesses complained it would unfairly prohibit them from
seeking money from the government to clean their property of any
contamination from the plant that may be uncovered later.
   That resulted in a disagreement between government lawyer Henry
Gill Jr. and Stanley Chesley, representing the residents, over
whether the settlement bars such future claims.
   Chesley contended the companies wouldn't be prohibited from
trying to get the government to pay costs from future cleanup. Gill
disagreed.
   He said the Energy Department believes any such costs should be
paid from the $73 million settlement. But Spiegel noted that the
Energy Department has estimated it could take $5 billion to clean up
the plant site alone.
   ``I have a difficult time understanding your position,'' Spiegel
said.
   The judge can either approve the settlement, reject it or send
both sides back to renegotiate. Spiegel also could clarify the
language of the settlement.
   Chesley said during a break in the hearing that he doesn't think
the disagreement will cause the settlement to unravel.

   Two members of the Azerbaijani People's Front,
which has been organizing mass meetings and strikes against local
authorities, were arrested Wednesday in the Azerbaijani capital of
Baku, an independent journalist said.
   Nazim Ragimov said by telephone from Baku that one of those
arrested was Umudov Dzhambakhaesh, one of nine members of the
grass-roots organization's governing board.
   Dzhambakhaesh was arrested when he went to offices of the
Interior Ministry to investigate the arrest earlier Wednesday of a
People's Front activist who was detained by police while hanging
posters announcing a local meeting of the group, Ragimov said.
   He said he did not have the name of the second activist.
   Workers in Baku struck at least 25 enterprises Monday and Tuesday
to press for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and other
demands.
   The Tass news agency reported Wednesday the strike ended with a
rally by 100,000 people in Baku on Tuesday night. Ragimov said the
Tass estimate of the number of participants was several times too
low.
   The rally decided to begin a strike throughout the southern
capital on Sept. 3 to renew its demands, Ragimov said.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been the scene of ethnic clashes between
mainly Christian Armenians and mainly Moslem Azerbaijanis. It is in
Azerbaijan, but its population is mainly Armenian and the
neighboring republic of Armenia has claimed the enclave be annexed
to it.

   U.S. officials took steps Wednesday to
extradite suspected drug traffickers from Colombia and announced a
$2 million program to help that country protect its officials from
intimidating drug violence.
   President Bush said top U.S. and Colombian officials would meet
to discuss what kind of help the United States can offer
violence-torn Colombia, but he again ruled out the use of U.S.
troops, noting Colombian President Virgilio Barco specifically ruled
out that option.
   ``They might need certain technical assistance to go after (the
drug traffickers),'' Bush said during a news conference with local
press at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine. ``They can use
training for some of their forces _ police, for example,'' he said.
   After Bush's remarks, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced
the Justice and State departments have agreed to offer Colombia a $2
million program designed to help protect its judges and others
threatened by ``narco-terrorist'' attacks.
   Under the agreement, the Justice Department's International
Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program will assess
Colombian needs and develop plans to improve Colombia's ability to
respond to threatened violence. The program would also seek to
improve investigative and forensic functions, the Justice Department
said.
   ``The ruthless victimization of judges, prosecutors and police by
drug cartels must be halted,'' Thornburgh said.
   The discussions later this week between Colombian Attorney
General Monica de Greiff and U.S. officials will focus on
extradition procedures, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Extraditions from Colombia to the United States were ended
abruptly in early 1987 after the Colombian Supreme Court, under
attack by drug traffickers, threw out the treaty.
   Barco imposed a state of siege last weekend following the
assassination Friday of leading presidential candidate Luis Carlos
Galan, an outspoken foe of drug traffickers.
   More than 11,000 people were arrested under the emergency
measures and Barco said extraditions to the United States would be
resumed.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the U.S. Embassy
in Bogota on Wednesday was ``making provisional arrest requests of
the top 12 fugitives'' named by Thornburgh on Tuesday. The top 12 _
none of whom has been arrested _ include the leaders of the
notorious Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels.
   Boucher said the U.S. is ``continuing to prepare formal
extradition packages, including supporting documentation'' against
those 12 and against Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged Medellin
money-launderer in Colombian custody. Martinez was indicted in
Atlanta in March.
   If Martinez is extradited, he could be taken swiftly out of
Colombia on a U.S. government plane an administration source said
has been at the Bogota airport since last weekend.
   The plane could be used to transport Martinez to the United
States, but there was no indication it was at the airport for that
purpose, the source, who spoke on condition anonymity, said.
   Another source at the airport, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the plane belonged to the Drug Enforcement
Administration, but DEA spokesman Frank Shults declined comment.
   The Marshals Service usually transports people being extradited
and it has its own fleet of aircraft that can be used for such work,
said service spokesman Bill Dempsey.
   ``We haven't been brought into the picture yet'' on the Martinez
case, he said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said they were mystified by the
reported arrest of another alleged drug trafficker in Colombia,
identified by newspapers as Rafael Orlandes Gamboa. The Bogota daily
El Espectador said a U.S. extradition request for him is pending
with Colombian authorities, but officials at the Justice and State
departments, the Marshals Service and the DEA said they had never
heard of him.
   U.S. officials also said they were unfamiliar with Helena Beatriz
Rodriguez, whom Colombian authorities reported arresting Wednesday
in Cartagena. The Colombians said she also was wanted on
drug-related charges in the United States.
   The discussions with de Greiff will help officials of both
countries determine how extraditions should be handled under the
state-of-siege rules, said source with the Bush administration.
   ``If it's to go well, they have to let us know what they need us
to do, the papers and procedures to make it work,'' the source said.
``It's not a process that's self-executing. It's complicated and has
to be done right.''
   Fitzwater said the discussions with de Greiff would also focus on
suggestions for security for Colombian judges.
   Dozens of judges have been killed by drug traffickers in
Colombia, and Congress last year earmarked $5 million for the State
Department to develop a program to provide more security for them.

   Daughters and granddaughters of Confederate
soldiers ended an era Wednesday when they moved from the stately
57-year-old Confederate Home for Women to a new health-care complex.
   Seven women left through a back door of the home, modeled after
the White House. It will be closed and eventually turned over to the
adjacent Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.
   ``I've got a beautiful room here _ I hate to give it up,'' Bertha
Moore said. ``But I know how conditions are here. They need money.''
   A dwindling endowment was cited by the Confederate Home board as
the main reason for the move.
   A relocation committee of the board announced in April it would
cost considerably less to move the women than to pay for repairs at
the deteriorating Confederate Home.
   The announcement sparked a smattering of protest and a lawsuit by
a resident of the home, Lila Lee Riddell, 98, to block the move.
When her effort in Richmond Circuit Court failed, she appealed to
the Virginia Supreme Court.
   Her lawyer's final effort, a motion for a temporary injunction
against the move until the Supreme Court hearing in September, was
rejected Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
   On Wednesday, a sole representative of the Citizen's Committee
for Memorial Preservation of the Confederate Home for Ladies stood
across the street from the home holding an American flag. The
committee was formed in May.
   Two Civil War re-enactors donned their Confederate uniforms and
greeted each woman as she left. ``We came down here to honor them,
to pay tribute,'' said Bob Smith.
   As she was being wheeled out of the home she lived in for 13

88, asked for the doll and clung to it as she was hoisted in her
wheelchair into a waiting van.
   Their beds and some of their belongings already had been moved to
the new residence, Brandermill Woods.
   Staff members fought back tears as they waved good bye.
   Holly DeJarnette, administrator of the Confederate Home, and
several other staff members will continue to work with the women at
Brandermill Woods.
   The seven women will move into adjoining rooms at The
Chesterfield, an assisted-living center adjacent to the health-care
center at Brandermill Woods.
   The home, originally called the Home for Needy Confederate Women,
was established by the 1898 General Assembly to provide care for
needy female relatives of Confederate soldiers. Upon entry to the
home, residents turned over their estates in exchange for life-long
care.
   In its heyday, the home had more than 70 residents.

   The government has reinforced border
patrols to head off Colombian drug runners who may be fleeing to
Bolivia to escape Colombia's offensive against drugs, police said
Wednesday.
   Police helicopters were placed on alert and additional guards
were sent to Bolivia's northern border with Brazil, police said.
   Gonzalo Torrico, the official responsible for drug interdiction,
said the government was concerned Colombia's war against cocaine
will ``generate a stampede of traffickers looking for refuge in
areas they have contacts.''
   There are dozens of cocaine processing labs in northern Bolivia's
Beni jungle region. From there, cocaine is flown to Colombia then
distributed to the United States or Europe.
   This impoverished nation of 7 million people produces the raw
material for at least one-third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. and
European markets, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said.
   ``The violence and corruption that exists in Colombia could be
transferred to Bolivia, especially because of the offensive by the
Colombian government,'' said Bolivia Sen. Daniel Cabezas, head of
the Senate committee on drugs.
   In June, two Colombian drug traffickers were captured when police
raided the town of Santa Ana de Yacuma, home to some of Bolivia's
top cocaine traffickers. There have been several killings in Santa
Cruz, 450 miles east of La Paz, involving Colombian drug runners,
police have said.
   ``Our problem in controlling the flow of traffickers from
Colombia is that we do not have the resources to control our air
space,'' Cabezas said.
   Police said the border patrols were reinforced and police
helicopters placed on alert.
   At least 350,000 Bolivians make their livings growing coca
leaves. The leaves are processed into cocaine paste, which is
refined into cocaine.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fired 150 rockets at
Charikar, north of Kabul, and seven into the capital, killing 17
civilians and wounding 23, the government said Wednesday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani also said the
second cluster-bomb rocket to hit Kabul landed on a street where
children were playing Saturday, killing seven and wounding five.
Amani said the United States supplies cluster rockets to the
guerrillas.
   Washington refuses to say what type of weapons it supplies to the
guerrillas, but the chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Wednesday suggested they may arm them with even more
sophisticated supplies.
   ``I'm a little leary of raising the military ante by giving them
tanks and bombs, but we may come to that if there's no other
solution,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., told a news conference
Wednesday in Islamabad, Pakistan.
   He said Washington's support should continue despite longstanding
antagonisms between the guerrilla groups that flared into fighting
in the field this week.
   ``I think the `interim' government (of guerrillas in exile) is
the best alternative at this time,'' said Pell.
   Also in Islamabad on Wednesday, guerrilla leaders rejected a
peace plan from Afghan President Najib, reiterating that they will
not stop fighting until the Marxist leader steps down.
   Najibullah Lefraye, spokesman for the guerrillas'
government-in-exile, said Najib's proposal is ``a collection of
bankrupt ideas that have been rejected.''
   Najib had offered to call elections within six months of an
immediate cease-fire.
   In Kabul, Amani said Tuesday's rocketing of Charikar, a small
city 38 miles north of the capital on the Salang Highway to the
Soviet Union, was the most intense of the 11-year-old civil war. He
said seven people were killed and 14 wounded.
   Amani blamed the fundamentalist guerrilla group Hezb-i-Islami led
by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar for the attack on Charikar, which has been
the scene of intermittent fighting in recent months. Hekmatyar's
group is the largest recipient of U.S. military aid.
   He said the seven rockets hit Kabul on Wednesday, killing 10
people and wounding nine, mostly women and children in residential
areas.
   Kabul has been rocketed almost daily since late June. U.N.
sources say 335 people were killed and more than 900 wounded by
rockets and a car bombing from June 25 to Aug. 12, nearly all of
them civilians.
   Guerrillas have claimed responsibility for some of the rockets,
but say they aim at military targets. They have accused the
government of firing rockets at civilian targets, but government
officials deny it.
   Cluster rockets explode in the air, scattering up to 30 bombs.
The government said the first cluster rocket hit Kabul on Aug. 15,
killing five civilians and wounding 23 in a housing complex near the
airport.
   Amani said the second, on Saturday, landed in the Cala-i-Shada
area of southwest Kabul.

   President Carlos Andres Perez has
proposed that nations of the Western Hemisphere hold a summit to
define strategies to combat drug trafficking.
   Venezuela on Wednesday also increased its forces on the Colombian
border to seal off escape routes during a Colombian military sweep
against the drug cartels.
   ``Narcotics trafficking has to be fought as the most abominable
crime of the century,'' said Perez, speaking at an anniversary
celebration of a cooperative educational institute late Tuesday.
   Perez said narcotics dealing would have to be considered a crime
``without frontiers'' in order to combat it effectively.
   Venezuelan press accounts have warned of a possible wave of drug
smugglers and their families sweeping into Venezuela to escape the
recent crackdown in Colombia.
   In Bolivia, authorities said patrols along that country's border
with Brazil were also reinforced and police helicopters were placed
on alert against Colombian traffickers.
   Perez said Venezuela had tightened patrols along its 1,000 mile
border with Colombia, traditionally an area plagued with smuggling
and guerrilla activity.
   Warning that the scourge of violence in Colombia could also take
place in Venezuela, Perez said: ``We are collaborating with the
Colombian armed forces so that Venezuela does not become a haven for
those people that are causing so much damage in Latin America.''
   The cooperation was limited to ``necessary custody of the border
area and offering our solidarity,'' Perez said.
   Venezuela does not have a history of drug trafficking, although
it is being increasingly used as a transfer point for cocaine and
other drugs being smuggled to Europe and the United States as the
cartels seek to diversify their routes, according to police.

<TEXT>
   The drifter charged with 13 ``Night Stalker''
murders shouted out that his trial is a ``joke'' and called the
judge an obscenity as deputies hauled him to his feet and took him
out of court Wednesday.
   The outburst came during a hearing from which defendant Richard
Ramirez had asked through his attorney to be excluded. The judge
insisted he appear.
   ``Hey, I don't want to be here. Don't you understand, man? What's
the problem?'' Ramirez, 29, shouted from his chair as Superior Court
Judge Michael Tynan tried to proceed.
   ``I won't come back in here _ you understand that?'' Ramirez
continued as two sheriff's deputies approached him, each taking an
arm and lifting him to his feet. ``This trial is a joke,'' he
exclaimed, then used obscenities as he was led out to a holding cell.
   Tynan had told Ramirez's lawyers that he believes the defendant
``is a grown man'' and should be present for proceedings.
   ``If he wants to act like a jerk, we can deal with it at that
time. We can restrain him,'' the judge said before Ramirez came into
court.
   Jurors, deliberating the charges, were unaware of the disruption.
   The defense has filed a motion to question jurors about the
impact on their deliberations of a colleague's slaying last week.
The panel resumed talks Aug. 16 with an alternate. Tynan scheduled a
hearing on the motion Aug. 31. The defense suggested that the motion
was tantamount to seeking a mistrial, but the prosecutor said he did
not interpret it that way.
   Ramirez is charged with 13 murders and 30 felonies stemming from
a killing spree that terrorized Southern California in 1985.
   After Ramirez's courtroom outburst, Tynan met with lawyers, then
summoned Ramirez back to court and said he had been informed by
defense attorneys that the defendant would cause further
disruptions, or ``a physical altercation,'' if he was forced to come
to court for the motions hearing next week.
   ``In light of that, the court finds good cause that you should be
absent when a hearing is held on these motions,'' Tynan said. He
asked Ramirez if he understood his right to be present and if he was
willing to waive it.
   ``Yes,'' he answered in a husky voice.
   The judge said he would be held in a lockup room near the
courtroom, listening to arguments over a loudspeaker.
   Should the jury return with its verdicts, Ramirez would be
required to be present. A verdict before Aug. 31 would make the
scheduled hearing moot.
   Outside court, defense attorney Ray Clark said Ramirez ``has good
days and bad days.''
   ``He just doesn't like court,'' said Clark.
   Meanwhile, Tynan announced he was leaving town until Monday on a
vacation scheduled to celebrate his wedding anniversary. He said any
questions that might arise from jurors would be handled Monday and
``anything extraordinary'' would be taken up by another judge. He
did not address the possibility that a verdict could be returned
while he is away.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Commission on Wednesday replaced the
liberal president of Beijing University, whose students helped lead
the spring pro-democracy movement that was suppressed in June.
   Ding Shisun was the second university president replaced since
the protests, and more replacements were anticipated as the ruling
Communist Party moves to prevent renewed campus unrest.
   The official Xinhua News Agency portrayed the move as
non-political and said the 62-year-old Ding had asked as early as
February to leave for ``health and other reasons.'' It said he had
been given a four-year term when appointed in 1984.
   However, school officials within the past month said repeatedly
that Ding had no plans to leave. When contacted by telephone as
recently as Monday, they said Ding remained president and made no
mention of a planned change.
   Ding was replaced by 56-year-old Wu Shuqing. Wu had been vice
president of People's University, whose students also took part in
the protests. Xinhua said He Dongchang, vice minister of the
Education Commission, appointed Wu at a ceremony Wednesday.
   He urged the school to keep a socialist outlook and train
students to be both ``red and expert'' in their fields.
   Students from Beijing University, considered China's most
prestigious school, took the lead in the spring protests as they
have in past political movements.
   After the April 15 death of ousted party leader Hu Yaobang,
hundreds of posters were put up on the Beijing University campus
mourning him and subtly criticizing the government.
   Ding maintained a low profile during the protests, speaking out
only to urge a speedy solution to the problem. But he also did
nothing to stop his students, while other schools pressured students
to stop protesting and some even locked campus gates before marches.
   The government has ordered concentrated political study for
teachers and students at all universities. Special measures have
been taken to keep Beijing University under control.
   Its freshman class has been cut from the planned 2,100 students
to 600, and the students have been ordered to take a year of
military training before beginning degree work. Six social science
departments, including history, philosophy and sociology, are not
being allowed to admit any new students, sources have said.
   Other colleges are starting classes this month to make up for
time lost in the spring, but Beijing University has been ordered to
delay reopening until Oct. 14. The measure was apparently to ensure
its students do nothing to disrupt the Oct. 1 celebration of the
40th anniversary of Communist rule.
   The nation's total college freshman class has been cut by 30,000
students, to 610,000.
   In late June, authorities in Shenzhen, a special export zone near
Hong Kong, fired the president of Shenzhen University for supporting
the democracy movement. The central province of Anhui fired the
deputy director of its education commission, also for allegedly
encouraging the protests.
   Other academics have been criticized harshly and some have been
jailed.
   Also Wednesday, a leading member of the Chinese-American
community, Anna Chennault, met with Chinese Vice President Wang Zhen
but refused to disclose what they discussed.
   She said upon returning to the United States she would report to
President Bush.
   Mrs. Chennault is the widow of Gen. Claire Lee Chennault, who
founded the World War II ``Flying Tiger'' force that backed the
Nationalist Chinese in their fight against Japan.

   Seven Hungarians were released
Wednesday, state media said, but still held were 43 other foreigners
accused of fomenting anti-government protests on the 21st
anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   The media said the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday protested the
foreigners' participation in the unrest.
   No official word emerged about the 320 Czechoslovaks reported
detained during Monday's protests.
   The official Hungarian news agency MTI has reported that Polish,
Dutch, Bulgarian, Italian, East and West Germans and Yugoslavs also
were detained.
   MTI said seven of nine Hungarians in custody were let go
Wednesday after ``repeated intervention'' by the Hungarian Embassy
and left Prague for home on a charter flight of the Hungarian state
airlines, Malev.
   It said two activists of a Hungarian youth group still were held
on charges of a grave breach of public order.
   Prague authorites decided to extend indefinitely the detention of
eight Italians, the Italian news agency ANSA said. It speculated
they could be expelled, possibly by Friday.
   Italy's Foreign Ministry summmoned Czechoslovakia's charge
d'affairs for a second time Wednesday to protest the continued
detention of Italian citizens.
   Czechoslovakia's official news agency, CTK, said the Foreign
Ministry summoned representatives of the Hungarian, Polish, Italian
and Dutch embassies and lodged a protest, complaining that their
citizens participated in the protests.
   At least three Poles were said to be among those held in Monday's
demonstration, which began when Hungarian activists unfurled a
banner and addressed a crowd of cheering Czechoslovaks calling for
more freedom.
   Poland's state news agency PAP says no proof exists that Poles
took part in the protests.
   The demonstration marked the anniversary of the 1968 invasion,
led by the Soviet Union and joined by all Warsaw Pact nations except
Romania to crush reforms then under way in Czechoslovakia.
   It took hours Monday before hundreds of helmeted riot police
wielding truncheons broke up crowds of at least 3,000 people calling
for freedom and withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   State media blamed foreign provocateurs, saying they came posing
as tourists.
   The Foreign Ministry reportedly told the diplomats the detained
foreigners had violated the law and their cases would be
investigated accordingly.
   MTI identified the released Hungarians as three cameramen who
tried to film the demonstration, two photo journalists for
independent publications and two youth activists.
   According to MTI, they had to pay fines ranging from $30 to $50
each.
   A statement issued jointly by the independent Czechoslovak human
rights group Charter 77 and the Hungarian opposition group League of
Free Democrats on the quelling of the protests, said despite the
police action, the ``system of repression is wavering in
Czechoslovakia.''
   The statement, referring to the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms
crushed by the invasion, defined Prague as ``the capital of hope''
21 years ago and noted that similar democratic reforms now are under
way in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   ``Today the world looks upon Warsaw, Moscow and Budapest
wondering if this bloody and stupid adventure called communism will
end at long last,'' it added.
   Referring to Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Romania _ the three
countries in the Soviet bloc most resistant to reform _ the
statement said: ``We trust that democracy will cross frontiers and
that the days of the dictatorship are numbered in Prague, Berlin
(and) Bucharest.''

   Family and friends of Huey P. Newton, the
slain co-founder of the Black Panther Party, portrayed him Wednesday
as a lonely man who'd been prepared for years to meet a violent
death.
   ``He felt that once he decided to be a revolutionary, he was in a
position of suicide anyway,'' Newton's older brother, Melvin, said
at a news conference at his home.
   Newton's bullet-riddled body was found before dawn Tuesday in the
same poor west Oakland neighborhood where he began organizing blacks
more than 20 years ago, several miles from his present home.
   Police had no suspects and no motive in the slaying, but said
neighborhood residents were offering help. ``Just about everyone
we've talked to has been very cooperative,'' said Lt. Mike Sims.
   About 200 mourners marched during a candlelight vigil Tuesday
night at the place where Newton, 47, was found, chanting cheering
and holding their fists high in the black-power salute.
   The neighborhood has been plagued by drug-dealing gangs, but
authorities have said they had no reason to believe Newton's slaying
was drug-related.
   Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver's former wife, Kathleen Cleaver,
said in an interview in New York that while Newton was clearly very
intelligent, ``he also was a very troubled person who was not able
to overcome his problems with drugs and alcohol.''
   The Los Angeles Times said he had a history of cocaine abuse, and
had been sentenced earlier this year to 90 days for possession of
drug paraphernalia, a violation of his parole.
   The San Jose Mercury News said that Newton was in Oakland
Municipal Court last week to enter a treatement program resulting
from a drunken driving charge.
   Newton's brother declined to comment on the reports and Huey
Newton's wife, Fredrika, denied her husband used cocaine.
   A coroner's report was completed Tuesday, but authorities refused
to release preliminary findings. Results of drug and alcohol tests
will not be available for two weeks, said Lt. John Dealy.
   Mrs. Newton said she had been prepared for years for Newton to
die violently, and said she recently had a premonition he might die
soon. ``Huey was talking about getting insurance just last week,''
she said.
   Mrs. Newton said the couple was having financial problems and
that Newton had been recovering from two recent abdominal operations.
   She and Melvin Newton said they were unaware of any other
problems plaguing Newton, and refused to speculate about what he was
doing in the neighborhood early Tuesday.
   With Bobby Seale, Newton founded the Black Panther Party. Armed
Panther members followed police cars to monitor their activities in
the black community.
   Under the slogan ``All power to the people,'' the Panthers also
operated a school, a health clinic and programs for ghetto
youngsters.
   The party drifted into violence and gradually disintegrated, as
members were killed and the FBI infiltrated and disrupted the
organization.
   ``As a spokesperson for disillusioned and often bitter youth in
the 1960s, Huey Newton spoke eloquently of their rage and
impatience. He succeeded, in his own way, in calling attention to
the many glaring imperfections in an imperfect society. We were
often in disagreement with his views and strategies, but one had to
admire his courage and persistence,'' said NAACP Executive Director
Benjamin L. Hooks.
   Newton was a frustrated man who longed for the excitement of the
1960s, said former Panther leader David Hilliard.
   ``He was certainly a lonely man in that we didn't have any more
fights, any more struggles,'' said Hilliard. ``We talked a lot about
loneliness and our desire to recreate the energy of the '60s.''
   Melvin Newton said his brother's latest desire was to produce a
film on environmental problems, which he believed were linked to the
racism and classism he'd fought as a Panther leader.
   Mrs. Cleaver, a recent Yale Law School graduate practicing
commercial law, said she saw Newton's slaying and the recent suicide
of Yippie founder Abbie Hoffman as ``epitaphs to the '60s.''
   Eldridge Cleaver was deeply saddened by the death, but was
declining interviews, political aide Susan Thompson said in Berkeley.
   Hilliard said Newton's death had prompted an outcry around the
country, and he urged blacks to organize around the issues that
prompted Newton and Seale to establish the organization.
   ``Let Huey's death move us to some action,'' he said. ``Huey's
spirit and his program can be picked up.''
   Supporters said a memorial fund had been established in Newton's
name to cover funeral costs and to fund community-based programs for
poor children.
   Funeral services were planned for Monday.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Soldiers and Guerrillas Cast ``Pall of Violence'' Over
Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers and Maoist guerrillas in Peru have cast a
``pall of violence'' over the country, Amnesty International said
Wednesday, reporting more and more disappearances, torturing and
killings of civilians.
   Peruvian officials in Lima would not comment on the report.
   In seven years, 3,000 prisoners have disappeared while in
government custody and government forces have killed thousands more
in mass executions and assassinations, the London-based human rights
group said in a report.
   Most victims, Amnesty said, are Indian peasants in remote
mountain villages who appear to be killed as punishment for
guerrilla activity.
   Civic leaders, journalists, lawyers and others critical of the
government have been killed, received death threats or had homes and
offices bombed, the report said.
   Many victims were killed soon after being released from short
detentions, or after their homes were searched or military
authorities publicly denounced them as subversives, according to the
report.
   Similar tactics have been used to crush labor unrest, it said.
   Trade unionists have disappeared or been killed, the report said,
and in February an elite police unit fired on striking farmers in
Ucayali. Amnesty said dozens of peasants were killed, but the exact
number was not known because police removed the bodies.
   ``Official statistics put the death toll at 15,000 in the ongoing
conflict and include civilians caught between government and
guerilla violence,'' it said. ``These activities have spread a pall
of violence over much of Peru.''
   Military courts are not known to have convicted any soldiers
implicated in rights abuses and rulings have tended to exonerate the
armed forces, dismiss the charges or prolong proceedings
indefinitely, it said.
   Amnesty said it sent its findings to the Peruvian government in
May but has not received a reply.
   The Associated Press called President Alan Garcia's press office
three times Wednesday and left messages requesting comment on the
report, but no spokesman called back.
   Garcia took office in July 1985 and pledged not to use
``barbarity to fight barbarity.'' One of his first acts was to fire
the commander-in-chief of the armed forces after peasants denounced
a massacre of 69 villagers only weeks after Garcia took office.
   No large-scale killings by army troops were denounced from late
1985 until May 1988, when residents of Cayara village charged that
troops killed 29 villagers in reprisal for a guerrilla ambush of an
army convoy on the village's outskirts.
   The Amnesty report said 11 of some 20 villagers detained in a
jungle village in May 1989 by soldiers were found dead the next day
and four others ``disappeared.''
   Shining Path rebels routinely torture, mutilate and murder
captives, Amnesty said, citing widespread execution-style killings
since 1982.
   In the last several years most of the peasant slaughters
denounced within Peru have been attributed by survivors to the
Maoist guerrilla group, which has intensified its violent campaign
to overthrow the government.
   In the biggest massacre of recent date, Shining Path guerrillas
in late February killed 37 men in a remote mountain village by
cutting their throats and shot to death a mother and her baby when
the woman tried to flee the scene.

   Hurricane Erin continued its northerly tour of the
mid-Atlantic Wednesday but forecasters gave it little chance of
approaching land with its 75 mph winds.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was located near 32.5 north
latitude and 46.1 west longitude, or about 950 miles southwest of
the westernmost Azores, the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables reported.
   ``It'll start accelerating up toward the north-northeast. It
probably won't develop much more over the next few days,'' said
meteorologist Jesse Moore. ``It's not expected to affect any land
area.''
   The storm moving north at about 7 mph was expected to pick up
speed Thursday. Storms are fed by warm waters and generally lose
strength as they head into cooler waters.
   The hurricane posed a danger to maritime traffic in the open
Atlantic, but ships have been warned to stay away.
   Erin was spawned off the Africa coast, became a named storm
Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph and was upgraded to
a hurricane Tuesday morning when a ship sailing near the center
reported high winds.
   There have been seven depressions in the Atlantic hurricane
season running from June 1 to Nov. 30. Erin is the third hurricane
of the year. Hurricanes are formed when sustained winds hit 74 mph.

<HEAD>Two Firms' Approvals to be Revoked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced
Wednesday it plans to revoke permission for two generic drug
companies to manufacture 28 products on grounds that they made false
statements in their applications.
   The FDA also announced that it has begun inspections of 20
leading drug comnpanies that manufacture generic products. It said
the inspections do not result from allegations of wrongdoing.
   The inspections were described as ``a further effort by the FDA
to assure the public of both the safety and the efficacy of the
generic drug supply in the United States.''
   The inspections will be in addition to the agency's previously
announced nationwide sampling of all versions of the 30
most-prescribed generic drugs on the market.
   FDA said the inspections are not related to its investigation of
11 generic drug firms for possible violations of federal safety and
production regulations.
   The agency said it sent formal notices Tuesday to two of these
companies, Par Pharmaceuticals of Spring Valley, N.Y., and Vitarine
Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., that it will propose withdrawal
proceedings for several of their previously approved applications.
   The announcement said the action would ``essentially end their
permission to make these drugs.''
   The agency said the action against Par involved three
applications covering Orphengesic tablets, Orphengesic forte tablets
and Hydrochlorothiazie and Triamterene tablets. It said the notice
to Vitarine involved 25 different drugs.
   The action was the most sweeping taken by the FDA since the
targeted investigation began. In its only previous revocation
action, on Aug. 3, the FDA revoked permission of Par and American
Therapeutics Inc. of Bohemia, N.Y. to produce Chlorzoxazon tablets.
   Both companies had previously decided to voluntarily recall or
suspend production of the products, the FDA said. It said there are
no known safety or effectiveness problems with the products, but
there were questions as to whether they met the specifications
approved by the agency.
   The companies have a right to appeal within 30 days after the
notices are published in the Federal Register.
   The FDA said it told the two companies that its investigations
are continuing and it may act against other products.
   Regarding its investigation of the 20 additional firms, the
agency said they were chosen partly because of their large numbers
of approved applications for generic drugs.
   The agency said it would conduct plant inspections at the firms,
and chemically test their products.
   Meanwhile, the inspector general's office at the Department of
Health and Human Services announced that it will survey generic and
brand name drug manufacturers to get their views on FDA's drug
approval process.
   Judy Holtz, spokeswoman for the inspector general, said the
survey would be conducted by interviewing represesentatives of 15 to
20 manufacturers both by telephone and in person. She said it was
requested by the FDA and is expected to take about four weeks.
   She said the survey was ``basically totally unrelated'' to audits
and investigations which the inspector general's office is
conducting of the generic drug industry.
   The FDA has been under pressure from Capitol Hill, principally
from Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., whose Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee has conducted its own probe of problems
of the industry.
   Dingell's staff shared information with the U.S. attorney's
office in Baltimore, which has obtained guilty pleas from three FDA
officials, two drug firms and three drug company executives.
   Ms. Holtz said the inspector general's office had been ``asked by
top FDA officials to take a quick look at what manufacturers think
about the drug approval process and provide them with feedback
regarding manufacturers' views.''
   When the study is completed, she said, FDA will be provided with
a summary of the manufacturers' points of view and concerns,
probably including suggestions for improvement.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battered hulk of the Marchioness pleasure
cruiser was tugged to its last berth Wednesday, three days after at
least 48 party goers on board were drowned following a collision in
the River Thames.
   The cruiser was patched up by welders on a mud bank at Southwark
Bridge in central London and then towed down river on the evening
high tide to Greenwich. After police inquiries into how it was
rammed and sunk early Sunday, the cruiser will be scrapped.
   ``Who wants to sail in her after this?'' asked salvage supervisor
Ron Livett.
   Twisted wreckage was visible through the windows of the cruiser
and a bunch of red roses on its crumpled roof. The flowers were put
there by the family of its missing skipper, Stephen Faldo.
   Scotland Yard police headquarters said 17 more bodies were
recovered from the river Tuesday night and through Wednesday,
bringing the total to 48 since the 90-ton cruiser went down at
Southwark Bridge less than two minutes after it was hit from behind
by the 1,475-ton dredger Bowbelle.
   Because no list was made of those boarding the vessel for the
26th birthday party of a London financier, Scotland Yard has revised
its figures of survivors and missing several times. Its latest
figure of those on board is 139, less the vessel's certified
capacity of 149 passengers and two crew.
   Police say they know of 84 survivors, five more than the figure
given earlier this week, and seven people still missing.
   River police superintendent Ted Allen said strong currents in the
dark and dangerous Thames mean his divers can spend only 30 minutes
at a time searching for more bodies.
   The skipper's wife, Deborah Faldo, went back to Southwark Bridge
on Wednesday for a last look at the cruiser.
   ``I want to look at the river he died on _ I wish I had been with
him,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Immigration officials Wednesday asked a
love-struck Soviet dancer whether she wants asylum after refusing to
rejoin her troupe, and they sought two Chinese dancers who left
their hosts and did not return.
   All three women were in Springville to perform in the World
Folkfest.
   Don Russell, director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's Denver office, said officials interviewed Svetlana
Kirenko, 32, who refused to join her Ukrainian Donbass troupe as it
boarded a bus for Salt Lake International Airport on Tuesday.
   ``We're asking her, `What do you want to do?''' Russell said. He
said Kirenko's entry visa doesn't expire until Nov. 1, giving her
time to decide what to do, and she was staying in Utah with friends
for now.
   Russell said Kirenko had fallen in love with Robert Retallick,
22, of Rexburg, Idaho, during a folk festival in that southeastern
Idaho city earlier this month.
   But if the relationship is her only reason for wanting to defect,
the government may be unable to grant her political asylum, he said.
   ``Asylum is based on persecution,'' Russell said. But she could
marry the American and apply for conditional resident status as an
immediate relative of an American citizen, he said.
   Retallick could not be reached Wednesday for comment. His sister,
Holly Retallick, said he left Rexburg late Tuesday for Salt Lake
City and she had not heard from him since.
   Russell said the INS had no information on the whereabouts of
Chen Li, 24, and Zhe Qian, 27, both from Guizhou, China.
   The two dancers told their host family they were going for a walk
Friday morning, then were seen by a neighbor getting into a car
driven by a man believed to be the husband of one of the women, said
Folkfest President Brent Haymond. The man is a Chinese exchange
student in Houston, and the other woman also has relatives in this
country, he said.
   The dancers called the host family back later in the day,
indicating they were outside the state but safe, and they thanked
the family for taking care of them, Haymond said.
   Haymond said the Chinese troupe was a last-minute festival
replacement for another dance group held back in Beijing because of
political turmoil there.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Hit Indiana, Illinois</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Powerful thunderstorms in Indiana and Illinois on Wednesday
spawned flooding, winds that knocked out power to thousands and
lightning that blasted a car on an interstate highway and gouged a
hole in the road.
   Rain-triggered floods in West Virginia closed roads and swamped a
fire house and other buildings.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell in New England, New
York, South Carolina, Georgia and the eastern and central Gulf Coast.
   Showers fell on the northern Rockies and the northern and central
Intermountain region between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada and
the mountains of eastern Oregon.
   Thunderstorms continued dropping heavy rain on sections of the
Ohio Valley on Wednesday afternoon. A morning storm dropped 1{ inch
of rain in the western Indiana city of Crawfordsville.
   The rain flooded two state highways in Shelby County, Ind.,
southeast of Indianapolis, and homes and streets in Champaign County
in eastern Illinois. A flash-flood watch was in effect for central
Indiana.
   Lightning hit an automobile on Interstate 74 in Montgomery
County, which includes Crawfordsville, but the car's occupants were
not seriously hurt. The strike left a hole 2{ feet wide and 1{ feet
deep.
   Lightning or wind knocked out power to 4,000 homes in Champaign
County, as well as two University of Illinois dormitories in
Champaign-Urbana on the first day of classes. Power was also knocked
out near rural Mayfield, Ky.
   Thunderstorm winds blew down a work shed in the central Illinois
city of Taylorville, and blew down trees south of Coal City in
western Indiana. Nickel-size hail also fell in Coal City.
   In central West Virginia, high water closed roads in Upshur
County and flooded a fire house in Selbyville, a store in Pickens
and homes in Helvetia. Water was 2 feet over a road in Newlon. A
flash-flood watch was in effect in all of West Virginia except the
panhandles.
   The rain in the West was generated by a strong cold front that
was expected to bring snow to higher elevations of western Wyoming.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees in Klamath Falls, Ore., to around 100 degrees in Beeville,
Texas. The low for the lower 48 states Wednesday morning was 33
degrees in Gunnison, Colo.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
middle and southern Atlantic Coast to Florida, the eastern and
central Gulf Coast, the Tennessee Valley, the southern half of the
lower Ohio Valley and the lower Mississippi Valley; scattered
showers and thunderstorms over the northern High Plains, the
northern and central Rockies, and the region between the mountains
of eastern Oregon and Washington, with strong, gusty winds over the
central Rockies.
   High temperatures were expected in the 90s across much of the
nation, the 60s in northern New England, along the southern shore of
Lake Superior and in the northern Rockies; in the 70s along the
Pacific Coast; in the 70s and 80s from inland northern California to
Nevada and the central and southern Rockies, and from the northern
Plains to the upper Mississippi Valley, the upper Great Lakes, the
Ohio Valley and much of the middle and northern Atlantic Coast; and
between 100 and 110 degrees in the desert Southwest.

<TEXT>
   Anti-communist vigilantes seeking to
avenge the massacre of 39 Protestant churchgoers clashed Wednesday
with Marxist rebels and 11 people were killed, the government-run
Philippines News Agency reported.
   According to the agency, about 60 members of the anti-communist
``Ituman'' group and soldiers of the army's 46th Infantry Battalion
found a rebel band Wednesday near Baracatan, about 600 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Three vigilantes and eight communist guerrillas were killed, the
agency said Thursday, quoting military sources.
   The Itumans had vowed to avenge the June 25 massacre of 39 people
in the remote mountain village of Rano. The victims, including some
Itumans, were gathered in a United Church of Christ chapel when
rebels entered.
   Communist rebels acknowledged the massacre but claimed Itumans
within the congregation started shooting first. The rebels promised
an investigation of the incident.
   The Itumans are among numerous religious cults armed and
supported by the military to fight Communist rebels.
   Following the massacre, the United Church of Christ condemned the
bloodshed but criticized the armed forces for using churches as
bases of operations in the 20-year-old insurgency.

<HEAD>Ambassador Accepts Soviet Guilt in Wallenberg Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet ambassador to Sweden on
Wednesday acknowedged his nation's guilt in the case of Raoul
Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat missing since his 1945 arrest by
Soviet troops.
   Wallenberg, who would be 77, is credited with saving tens of
thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi concentration camps in World
War II.
   The secretary of the Raoul Wallenberg Association, Sonja
Sonnenfeld, called Ambassador Boris Pankin's statement the Soviet's
most explicit public statement about the missing diplomat.
   ``It goes farther than anything they have said before in
accepting guilt,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``It is
remarkable. It must have been dictated by Moscow.''
   Pankin insisted Wallenberg is dead, but Mrs. Sonnenfeld said she
believes the diplomat still is alive.
   Moscow has said Wallenberg died of natural causes in prison in
1947, but Soviet dissidents claim to have seen him alive as late as
1986.
   Pankin did not say why the Soviet Union is guilty and Soviet
authorities never explained why they arrested Wallenberg. Some
historians believe he was mistaken for an American spy.
   
   ``The dead cannot be brought back to life,'' Pankin said in an
article written for the Moscow News and printed in Swedish in the
Expressen daily.
   ``The only thing you can do is to again praise his
accomplishments and express feelings of compassion and guilt to his
people and those closest to him,'' Pankin wrote.
   ``We are ready to do everything to reinstate and strengthen the
growing trust between our countries, to turn the case of the search
for Raoul Wallenberg into a mark of honor for his memory.''
   He denounced Wallenberg's alleged death as an excess of the
Stalin era.
   ``Such is this whole terrible story that the ghastly
pointlessness is typical for that time,'' he wrote.
   The ambassador said it is not surprising many people refuse to
believe Wallenberg is dead, since Soviet authorities initially
denied he was in custody. ``Who believes you if you have lied
before?'' he said.
   Wallenberg issued Swedish travel documents to 20,000 Hungarian
Jews slated for Nazi concentration camps. His intervention with
German authorities was credited with winning survival for another
100,000 Jews from the country's prewar community of 750,000.
   
   He was arrested by Soviet troops who entered Budapest in 1945.
   Earlier this year, Soviet authorities invited four people to
Moscow, including Wallenberg's half-brother and half-sister, to meet
KGB intelligence officers and Foreign Ministry officials. The group
plans to go in October.
   Pankin said they will not be given new information, but will see
the original 1947 document reporting Wallenberg's death, written by
the prison doctor to then State Security Minister Viktor Abakumov.

   Police said they had caught a pioneer of
Colombian drug smuggling Wednesday, but those who run the bloody,
billion-dollar cocaine trade remained at large.
   The government declared its ``firm decision to extradite''
traffickers to the United States in the crackdown on the drug
underworld that began after the leading presidential candidate was
assassinated on orders of the cocaine barons.
   Police said they arrested Bernardo Londono Quintero, about 60, in
a raid on his daughter's apartment in the Caribbean coastal city of
Baranquilla on Wednesday. He offered no resistence, but a revolver
was seized in the raid, they said.
   He is regarded as a pioneer of the Colombian cocaine business,
which began expanding in the late 1960s, and was the only to retain
some of his power when the new, more violent generation took over in
the mid-1970s.
   Police also reported the arrest on Wednesday of drug suspect
Helena Beatriz Rodriquez in the coastal resort city of Cartagena.
They said she also was wanted in the United States on drug-related
charges, but U.S. officials in Washington said they were unfamiliar
with her.
   Also reported arrested was Rafael Orlandes Gamboa, for whom
Bogota newspapers said a U.S. extradition request is pending with
Colombian authorities. Officials at the U.S. Justice and State
departments, the Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement
Administration said they had never heard of him.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged money manager for the
Medellin cartel, was picked up during a weekend dragnet. Police and
U.S. authorities said they were trying to arrange speedy
extradition, but that the paperwork might take a wewek or more.
   The arrests came during an anti-drug campaign by police and the
military prompted by the assassinations last week of a judge, a
national police colonel and Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe
of the cocaine lords who was expected to be Colombia's next
president.
   President Virgilio Barco established emergency procedures for
extraditing traffickers wanted in the United States. The Supreme
Court nullified the extradition treaty with Washington in June 1987,
after years of intimidation of the judicary. At least 220 judges and
other officials have been killed.
   Barco also authorized seizures of traffickers' possessions.
Police and soldiers continued raids Wednesday on mansions, farms,
office buildings, restaurants and other property belived owned by
the drug bosses.
   Carlos Lemos Simonds, the communications minister, declared
Wednesday ``there's a firm decision'' to extradite suspects, but the
U.S. bureaucracy must act quickly. He said Barco's emergency
measures empower police to hold suspected traffickers for up to
seven days without charges, but then they must be freed.
   Lemos also asked that Washington provide more aid for the
anti-narcotics campaign, and added: ``The other help we need is to
lower consumption and demand in the United States.''
   At his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush
said: ``They might need certain technical assistance. ... ``They can
use training for some of their forces _ police, for example.''
   Bush said Barco made clear ``that he was not requesting United
States troops. ... I know enough about this hemisphere, and I've had
enough experience in dealing with countries in Latin America ... to
know the constraints ... in terms of dispatching troops.''
   Five suspects in the Galan murder were arrested Tuesday.
Authorities announced late Wednesday that four of the suspects had
been identified by more than a dozen witnesses who were at the
rally. But no formal charges had yet been filed.
   Israel said Wednesday it was investigating reports that Israeli
mercenaries trained assassination teams for the Colombian drug
cartels. Israel television said Israeli military experts involved in
training paramilitary forces for the cocaine gangs recently were
smuggled out of Colombia.

   A section of the historic Pontalba Apartments,
said to be the first apartments built in the United States,
collapsed Wednesday into Jackson Square in the heart of New Orleans'
French Quarter.
   No one was hurt, but the collapse caused inestimable damage to
one of the nation's most prestigious buildings. The three-story
building where the collapse occurred was completed in 1851 and, with
a companion building on the opposite side of Jackson Square, was
undergoing a $10 million renovation.
   Scaffolding on the Jackson Square side of the building collapsed
about 5:30 p.m., witnesses said. When the scaffolding fell, it
brought down a small section of the building.
   Most of the damage was to a 40- to 50-foot section of scaffolding
which stood three stories high. Emergency crews roped off the area
and kept spectators away.
   James Ellis, one of the ice cream vendors who regularly work the
square, had his cart crushed by falling debris.
   ``All of a sudden, it just started cracking and the scaffolding
started falling. I thought `I'm dead.' It just started falling. I
ran off, but I had to leave my ice cream cart behind.''
   At the time, most of the tourists were on the other side of
Jackson Square, listening to a jazz band.
   It was the second spectacular Jackson Square accident in 16
months. In May 1988, fire destroyed the top floor of the nearby
Cabildo, where the Louisiana Purchase territories were transferred
from France to the United States.
   Wednesday's collapse occurred at the Lower Pontalba Apartments
which, with the Upper Pontalba on the west side of Jackson Square,
was built for $300,000 in the 1850s by Micaela Leonard Almonaster,
who was 15 when she married a French baron named Joseph Celestin.
   After the baron's father tried to kill her some years later, the
baroness left France, returned to New Orleans, hired an architect
and a work crew that finished both Pontalba buildings in 2{ years.
   There are 25 residential apartments in the Lower Pontalba and
several street-level stores. The scaffolding collapsed onto the
square just outside La Madeleine, a fashionable, European-style cafe
whose patrons escaped harm.
   The Upper Pontalba and Lower Pontalba are among five historic
buildings on three sides of Jackson Square. All are designated as
National Historic Landmarks.
   The others are the Cabildo, built in 1799; the St. Louis
Cathedral, rebuilt in 1851, and the Presbytere, started in 1791.

<HEAD>Parliament Decides Former Minister Should Stand Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament voted Wednesday to try a former
socialist minister in a special court for alleged involvement in an
agricultural scandal that defrauded the European Economic Community.
   Lawmakers reached the decision after a two-day stormy debate on
findings of a 12-member parliamentary investigating committee.
   Former Deputy Finance Minister Nikos Athanassopoulos will face
trial before the Supreme Court president and 12 judges.
   The investigating committee presented evidence to the 300-member
parliament that allegedly shows Athanassopoulos was involved in
forging harbor logs and customs invoices.
   The invoices were changed to show that 9,000 tons of Yugoslav
maize sold to the EEC in 1986 were Greek, cheating the European
Community of import duties and making it pay subsidies.
   Athanassopoulos was defeated in his bid for re-election on a
Panhellenic Socialist Movement ticket in June 18 balloting.
   The election ended inconclusively, prompting a
conservative-leftist coalition to pledge to clean up Greek political
life by investigating scandals allegedly involving members of the
former government.
   The alliance of the conservative New Democracy Party and the
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress, pledged to hold
new elections no later than November 5.
   The coalition controls 173 parliamentary seats and the socialists
hold 125 places. The remainder are held by two independents.
   Parliament speaker Athanasis Tsaldaris said lawmakers voted
170-118 to try Athanassopoulos, with five ballots blank, three
declared invalid and four deputies failing to vote.
   Athanassopoulos, who addressed parliament before the vote,
described the charges against him as a ``fairy tale.''
   Parliament is scheduled later this month to debate illegal
wiretapping, financial and arms procurement scandals in which former
Premier Andreas Papandreou and senior members of his Cabinet were
allegedly involved.
   Papandreou has denied any involvement in the $200 million Bank of
Crete scandal and rejected charges that he took kickbacks to procure
French and American built jet fighters for the air force.
   Also Wednesday, the government announced that security files on
Greeks involved in the Communist uprising 40 years ago will be
burned to end a lingering symbol of animosity between rightists and
leftists.
   The files were compiled on people considered a threat to public
security since the 1940s. They will be burned Tuesday, said
government spokesman Athanassios Kanellopoulos.

<HEAD>Khamenei Urges Parliament To Back Rafsanjani's Cabinet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran's spiritual leader Wednesday called
on Parliament to set aside political differences and approve
President Hashemi Rafsanjani's proposed Cabinet as soon as possible.
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged parliamentary deputies to ``vote on
competence alone'' rather than ``differences of taste, or God
forbid, personal matters.''
   His appeal for a speedy vote of confidence in Rafsanjani's
Cabinet at a parliamentary session scheduled Sunday indicates
opposition to Rafsanjani's policies and the 22 ministers he has
chosen to carry them out.
   In a speech broadcast by Tehran Radio, which was monitored in
Nicosia, Khamenei stressed Iran cannot afford to have Rafsanjani's
government undercut by no-confidence votes against ministers.
   ``Frankly, in these times, every single day is crucial. If one of
these ministries is left without someone in charge, even for a day
or a week, a big part of the people's affairs will be left undone,''
Khamenei said.
   Rafsanjani, the 54-year-old former parliament speaker, emerged as
Iran's new leader after the June 3 death of revolutionary leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   In a landslide election victory July 28, he won the presidency
and unprecedented executive powers in constitutional reforms
designed to streamline Iran's decision making.
   Rafsanjani favos ending Iran's isolation and attracting Western
investment to rebuild Iran after its eight-year war with Iraq.
   He is bitterly opposed by hard-liners led by outgoing Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who think his policies deviate from
Khomeini's course.
   Rafsanjani dumped Mohtashemi and other hard-liners in his
proposed Cabinet in favor of technocrats, though more than half of
parliament called on him to keep Mohtashemi.
   In an apparent attempt to pacify his critics, Rafsanjani told
Iranian diplomats gathered in Tehran Wednesday that his policies do
not deviate from Khomeini's strategy.
   He also denied there is a power struggle.
   ``What exists in our country ... is the presence of different
tastes and currents of thought, and not a power struggle,'' Tehran
Radio quoted him as saying.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, quoted Mohtashemi as saying Wednesday: ``Any new plan and
principle contrary to (Khomeini's) principles is a blatant violation
of his clear path.''

<HEAD>Angola Says Rebels Killed 41 People</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebels violating a cease-fire
killed 41 people and injured 55 in the past 10 days, Angola's state
news agency ANGOP reported Wednesday.
   According to ANGOP, rebels killed 24 government soldiers and
civilians in clashes around the country, including attacks on the
rebels' former central Angolan stronghold of Huambo.
   Government forces killed 17 rebels and captured several caches of
arms, said the report, monitored in Lisbon.
   The news agency also reported the death of former Philippine air
force Lt. Col. Jesus Baldonado, who was working as a security
officer at an Angolan diamond mine when he was kidnapped Aug. 12 by
fighters of the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
   The Manila Foreign Ministry also Wednesday confirmed Baldonado's
death.
   U.S.-backed rebels led by Jonas Savimbi have not confirmed any of
the clashes.
   The reports came as Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
returned from a meeting on the Angolan peace process with seven
other African leaders in Harare, Zimbabwe.
   They asked Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to revitalize
Angolan peace efforts that began failing immediately after dos
Santos sealed a truce with Savimbi on Jun. 22 at an African summit
in Gbadolite, Zaire.
   An ensuing cease-fire lasted one week and government and rebels
repeatedly exchange accusations of truce violations.
   Last week, the rebels killed six Cubans fighting with Angolan
soldiers and accused government forces of launching a large-scale
attack in southern Angola.
   Mobutu has mediated sporadic negotiations between the two sides
since the cease-fire, but the fighting has escalated over the past
two weeks.
   In Washington, the State Department said national reconciliation
in Angola only can be achieved by direct negotiations between the
guerrillas and government.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said they expect
another round of talks in Kinshasa shortly and have urged both
parties to progress on the central issue of how to achieve
reconciliation.
   The guerrillas have been fighting for a share in government since
Portuguse colonizers hastily withdraw in 1975, leaving rival groups
to fight for power. The U.S. government gives the rebels between $15
million and $18 million aid a year.
   Under international peace accords signed last year, South Africa
pledged to end aid to the rebels and give independence to Angola's
southern neighbor, Namibia, in exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops fighting with Angolan government troops.

   Frightened children wouldn't talk about years of
rape, sodomy and beatings allegedly inflicted by their father until
about two weeks after they were taken from their apartment,
authorities said Wednesday.
   At an arraignment, Assistant District Attorney Marie Corliss said
the nine children's treatment by Herman Carlie McMillan and his
wife, Frances, was ``reminiscent of medieval torture.''
   She quoted Mrs. McMillan as saying, ``I have seen my husband
perform sex acts on my oldest female child.''
   The government also said Mrs. McMillan told investigators her
husband had sodomized other children, tied them up and beaten them
with paddle boards.
   McMillan was held without bail, and his wife held in lieu of
$10,500 bail. Both were due back in court Friday.
   In a related development, authorities said McMillan, 42, had
twice escaped from North Carolina prisons, where he was serving time
for a 1967 assault and two charges of breaking and entering.
   After his second escape he spent eight years hiding from the law.
At least part of that time he lived in New York's Bronx borough,
where he was arrested on separate assault charges in 1974.
   Police and social workers on May 25 removed the McMillans' six
boys and three girls, ages 4 months to 16 years, from the cramped
three-room apartment.
   Police arrested the parents Monday night and charged McMillan
with rape, sodomy, assault, incest, reckless endangerment,
endangering the welfare of a minor and sexual abuse.
   Mrs. McMillan, 34, was charged with assault and endangerment. She
had no prior arrest record.
   It was charged that the couple held the children captive for at
least three years in the unlit, unheated apartment where they were
sexually abused, beaten or had their heads held underwater.
   City regulations require that a social worker from either the
city or a voluntary agency interview each child before he or she is
placed in a foster home, and the social workers usually ask the
child about sexual abuse.
   But a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources Administration,
Suzanne Trazoff, said it usually takes some time before a child
volunteers details of abuse.
   ``Children don't necessarily walk in the door and say `I was
sexually abused,''' she said. ``Information has a way of coming over
time.''
   After his arrest Monday, McMillan told police he had secretly
buried three other children, who had died as infants over the last
five years, apparently of natural causes. Police Wednesday resumed
digging for the bodies.

<HEAD>Gasoline Rationing Ends in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday ended eight
years of gasoline rationing, saying rising prices have curbed demand.
   Gas, once so cheap that trucks and planes from elsewhere in
Central America fueled up in Nicaragua, now sells for $1.86 a gallon.
   Rationing had limited private consumers to 17 gallons a month.
   Energy Minister Emilio Rappaccioli said fuel deliveries to
service stations now will be based on demand, not quotas, reported
Barricada, official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista Party, and
the pro-government El Nuevo Diario.
   Rappaccioli said international missions and the diplomatic corps,
which pay in much-needed hard currency, will still need gasoline
coupons.
   The government began rationing gas by issuing coupons in 1981,
after Nicaragua stopped getting high-quality Venezuelan
reconstituted petroleum. Venezuela stopped deliveries when Nicaragua
stopped paying its bills.
   The high-yield Venezuelan fuel coupled with government subsidies
made for cheap gasoline prices in Nicaragua, leading to fuel
shortages at a time when the leftist government started to fight a
guerrilla war with the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras.
   Nicaragua gets nearly all its oil from the Soviet Union and its
allies.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge meanwhile announced that the
government will permit Red Cross verification of political prisoners
in Nicaragua.
   The last cross-check by the Red Cross and other international
human rights groups was carried out in 1987.
   Borge told reporters on Tuesday night that 1,440 Contra prisoners
are being held in custody, and that the International Red Cross has
been invited to verify the government figure.
   The country's total prison population is 7,003, including
Contras, former guardsmen of ex-dictator Anastasio Somoza, members
of the military and common criminals, the interior minister said.
   Lino Hernandez, executive secretary of the independent Permanent
Commission on Human Rights, disputed the government figures on
Wednesday.
   He said his organization believed the government is holding at
least 6,000 political prisoners.

   U.N. poll watchers leave for Nicaragua this
week to monitor voter registration for national elections, officials
said Wednesday.
   An advance party of up to 10 civilian poll watchers headed by
Iqbal Riza, director of General Assembly Affairs, will open the
headquarters of the U.N. election monitoring mission in Managua on
Friday, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   During Sept. 8-10, the observers will watch voters registering
for the February election, he said.
   The U.N. mission to Nicaragua is the world body's first effort to
monitor election procedures in a sovereign state. The United Nations
frequently has overseen independence referendums in colonies and
territories and currently is monitoring Namibia's independence
elections.
   Under the Central American peace accords, Nicaragua pledged to
hold free and fair national elections on Feb. 25. The Sandinista
government asked for election monitors from the United Nations and
Organization of American States. Opposition parties in Nicaragua
also requested the U.N. election monitors.
   The United States repeatedly has expressed skepticism that the
Sandinistas will permit a fair campaign.
   Officials from the OAS are expected to arrive in Nicaragua in
September, and the U.N. monitors will begin coordinating their
efforts, said Giuliani.
   Nicaragua reformed its constitution and election laws and agreed
to hold national elections for the first time in five years under a
1987 Central American peace plan.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers arrested and beat 14
peasants and plundered and burned down their homes in an isolated
village in northern Haiti, radio stations said Wednesday.
   Radio Soleil, owned by the Roman Catholic Church, quoted Francois
Pierre-Louis of the leftist National Popular Assembly party as
saying that 40 soldiers rounded up peasants on the night of Aug. 17
in the hamlet of Champagne, tied them up and beat them.
   The peasants were still jailed Wednesday in nearby Le Borgne, 200
miles from Port-au-Prince, he said, without specifying the charges.
   Other Port-au-Prince radio stations carried the same report. Army
officials in northern Haiti could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
   Pierre-Louis said the soldiers fell upon the peasants after
failing to find three National Popular Assembly leaders they came to
arrest.
   He told Radio Soleil that Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
wants ``to intimidate all members of popular organizations.''
   Several parties and leftist groups have complained about the
army's alleged persecution and illegal arrest of peasants and
radical parish priests in rural Haiti during past months.
   Avril took office in a September coup that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy. Namphy came to power after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled to exile in France in 1986.

<TEXT>
   The former real estate manager of the Bay
Area Rapid Transit District was sentenced to five years in prison
Wednesday after pleading guilty to embezzlement and conspiracy to
defraud the rail system.
   Michael M. Sharpe, 37, of Oakland is the highest-ranking official
charged in a federal investigation of BART. Other charges have been
filed against a half-dozen middle managers and private citizens,
several of whom have admitted paying or collecting kickbacks
   Under U.S. District Judge Fern Smith's sentence, Sharp must repay
the sum he stole, which is yet to be determined. Defense lawyer
Harold Rosenthal estimated it at $125,000, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ben Burch at $176,000.
   The embezzlement charge covered 17 thefts between March 1986 and
March 1988 in which Sharpe took kickbacks from two contractors and a
building inspector.
   Sharpe also pleaded guilty to conspiring with one of the building
inspectors, David W. Collins, to defraud BART. Collins has pleaded
guilty to the same charge.
   According to the charge, the two men plotted in 1986 to buy a
parcel of land in Oakland for BART at an inflatd price and keep the
extra money.
   Sharpe also pleaded no contest to income tax evasion.
   In a brief statement to the judge, Sharpe said he had been under
emotional and financial stress and was sorry for what he had done.
He is to start his prison sentence Sept. 25.

<HEAD>Pinochet Lists Stiff Demands To Civilians Who Will Succeed Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet made stiff
demands Wednesday to civilian authorities who will succeed his
16-year-old military government, including that he continues as head
of the powerful army.
   Pinochet also said the military, after leaving power in March,
will not accept ``reprisals'' _ apparently prosecution of military
officials _ for human rights violations.
   He said the winner of the December presidential election should
answer his demands before the change of government.
   In a speech marking his 16th anniversary as army commander, the
73-year-old military leader said the future civilian government will
have to accept a still-prominent role for the armed forces.
   The improvement of relations between civilians and military will
depend ``on the total acceptance'' of his demands, Pinochet said.
   Pinochet, who spoke to hundreds of military officers and
government officials at the Military Academy, made clear that his
demands were discussed with commanders of the other services.
   He was appointed army commander on Aug. 23, 1973 by civilian
President Salvador Allende. Nineteen days later, Pinochet led the
bloody military coup that toppled Allende, an avowed Marxist.
   The demands listed by Pinochet included that he continue as army
commander, and that the chiefs of the air force, navy and national
police also continue in their jobs. The demands fall under a
controversial constitutional clause that the opposition has promised
to change.
   Other demands were that the powerful military courts remain
unchanged, the armed forces be allowed to organize ranks and a
severe anti-terrorist law be fully enforced.
   Chile's next president will be chosen in an election scheduled
for Dec. 14 and will take office on March 11. The opposition's
single candidate, Patricio Aylwin, a centrist, is widely favored to
defeat the government candidate Hernan Buchi.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election after losing a
referendum last October on a proposal to extend his rule until 1997.
   Pinochet also said the armed forces ``will not tolerate any of
members being humilliated or mistreated for their actions, which
were aimed at saving Chile.''
   After seizing power, the armed forces launched a severe
repression of Allende's supporters. Thousands were arrested and many
were killed, tortured or sent into exile.
   The opposition has promised to look into human rights abuses and
bring those responsible for them to trial.

   Presidents of the AFL-CIO, the United Mine
Workers and other unions demonstrated labor solidarity Wednesday by
participating in a sit-down demonstration and heading off to jail
together.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and UMW President Richard Trumka
led the group of labor leaders supporting strikes involving
Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co., Pittston Coal Group Inc. and
Eastern Airlines.
   The labor leaders faced with common problems _ job losses and
eroding market shares _ attended a rally in Richmond before
traveling to the Russell County Courthouse where a judge has fined
the UMW $7.5 million for violating restrictions on the strike
against Pittston.
   Kirkland, Trumka and 17 others representing a dozen labor unions
locked arms and sat on the steps of the red brick courthouse to
block the entrance.
   At the same time, 1,200 workers joined raised hands under a
slight drizzle and, accompanied by Kirkland on the harmonica, sang
``Solidarity forever ... for the union makes us strong.''
   Trumka gave a thumbs-up sign as he and the others were led away
to the county jail around the corner where they were charged with
obstruction of free passage.
   ``Today gives testimony to the fact that they're never going to
fight us alone again. We're in it together,'' Trumka yelled to the
crowd on the courthouse lawn.
   The officers represented coal miners, machinists, airline pilots,
flight attendants, government employees, communications workers,
service employees, department store workers, electrical workers,
steel workers, firefighters and transport workers.
   The labor leaders were released after posting $500 property
bonds, and drove farther into the southwest Virginia coalfields to
attend another rally Wednesday night in St. Paul.
   The maximum penalty for the misdemeanor is a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine, but defense attorney Scott Mullins said he doubted the
protesters would be penalized heavily.
   UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said the mass arrest was ``a statement
that the system has failed working people. The courthouse was chosen
to symbolize the failure of government to protect working people.''
   UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts said organized labor is focusing
on Pittston because the company is attempting to ``bust the union''
and they believe a wound to one labor unit is a wound to all.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said Trumka, not companies or
judges, is to blame for the 55,000 UMW job losses since 1982 and the
erosion of the union coal market share because he is negotiating
unworkable contracts.
   ``We're trying to raise public awareness and congressional
awareness of what is happening to the working class in America,''
said Steve A. Danielson, a 22-year veteran pilot for Eastern
Airlines. ``I'm trying to fight Frank Lorenzo and corporate America.
We want justice.''
   Lorenzo is chairman of Eastern, where more than 600 pilots have
crossed picket lines since the strike against the airline began
March 4. Eleven days ago, Eastern announced it had filled its quota
of 1,700 pilots for its smaller, reorganized operation. The ALPA has
about 3,500 striking members.
   Striking Eastern pilots in uniform on Wednesday mingled with
miners dressed in combat fatigues from the southwest coalfields and
telephone workers from Virginia.
   ``We're finally one big unit,'' said Pat C. Easton, an operator
in Richmond. She said she has been off the job since Aug. 6, when
the Communications Workers of America failed to reach contract
agreements with Bell Atlantic.
   Although the union signed a pact with Bell last week, the strike
still hinges on settlements with the company's local subsidiaries.
   The strike against Pittston began April 5 and involves 1,695
union employees in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
Negotiations are to resume next week.

   Canadian Jane Weber sailed into Plymouth
in southwest England late Wednesday night at the end of a solo
crossing of the Atlantic Ocean aboard her 43-foot yacht Tilley
Endurable.
   Tired but obviously elated, the 44-year-old yachtswoman received
a boisterous welcome at Plymouth's Millbay Marina from Canadians who
gathered to greet her.
   She left Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the start of the 2,700-mile
voyage on July 29 and became the first Canadian woman to sail across
the Atlantic single-handed.
   Born in Bristol in western England, Ms. Weber took up sailing
eight years ago. She said she used the solo Atlantic challenge as
preparation for a round-the-world yacht race next year.
   She told reporters a storm badly damaged her monohull cutter.
   ``The storm damaged my main sail and over two foot of water
flooded the cabin,'' she said. ``It completely knocked out my
computers and damaged my batteries.''
   She figured repairs may run more than $23,000, but said it was
worthwhile.
   ``I have enjoyed the trip. It was hard and challenging,
especially when the weather was bad, but sailors have short memories.
   ``I am looking forward to having a bath. I have just done over
several thousand miles and feel I deserve it.''

   At least 46 pilot whales died in a
mass beaching in the remote far north of New Zealand and wildlife
rangers were trying to refloat 10 that survived, officials said
Thursday.
   A spokesman for the Conservation Department said the animals
washed ashore Wednesday on Ninety Mile Beach, a stretch of sand
along the western side of the isthmus of Aupori Peninsula.
   There was no immediate explanation for the beaching. Officials
said the herd must have come in on high tide after midnight.
   Local farmers and members of a diving club worked through the
night with conservation staff to save the whales, which were taken
by truck across the peninsula to calmer waters.
   Officials said 46 dead whales had been counted so far but that
there could be more further up the beach.
   Local tour bus driver David McNee sighted the first dead whale
early Wednesday and reported that others ``appeared to be flapping
about at the edge of the tide.''
   Staff at a nearby farm tried to coax the creatures into the water
and members of a local diving club were called in to help.
   Keith Smith, a local farmer, said it took at least six people to
roll a whale on its side. He said at least 50 people were involved
in the effort, some dug holes to ease the whales' discomfort, caused
by lying on their fins.
   Rescuers stood up to their shoulders in the surf trying to
stabilize the whales.
   ``They would roll over on their side, they didn't know where they
were,'' Smith said.
   He said at least five whales were returned to the water but that
three came back.

   A key Cabinet official of newly inaugurated Prime

   ``That such news would be reported was due completely to my own

news conference televised live Thursday. Yamashita is the
government's main spokesman and the prime minister's top lieutenant.
   ``The task of he Kaifu Cabinet is to promote clean government and
as I must follow that and support the prime minister ... I can offer
only my deepest apologies to the people of Japan,'' he said, adding
that he was ``seriously considering'' whether to resign or remain in
office.
   Yamashita's remarks were prompted by an article in the respected
weekly Shukan Shincho magazine alleging that he had an affair with a
26-year-old office worker he met at a Tokyo bar where she worked
part time in 1984. It said the affair ended in 1987.
   The magazine, which went on sale Thursday, also said the
69-year-old Yamashita, who is married, offered the woman $21,000
just one week before he assumed office Aug. 9, but quoted him as
saying it was not intended as ``hush money.''
   ``I did it from my own good intentions after hearing that she's
still having problems in her life,'' the magazine quoted Yamashita
as saying. The report said the woman, whom it did not name, did not
accept the money.
   Reports in the mass-circulation Mainichi Shimbun newspaper and by
the Japan Broadcasting Corp. earlier Thursday said Yamashita was
planning to resign. But Kyodo News Service said he had decided
simply to apologize after discussing the matter with his mentor,
Liberal Democratic Party elder Toshio Komoto.
   The reports came just two weeks after similar allegations helped
bring down Kaifu's predecessor, Sousuke Uno, and could deal a severe
blow to Kaifu, who analysts believe to be little more than a
caretaker until his term as party president, and prime minister,
expires in late October.
   ``For the time being we will apologize and try to explain to the
people and wait for further reaction,'' said a member of Komoto's
faction within the party. He requested anonymity.
   After only 69 days in office, Uno, who allegedly kept paid
mistresses, announced his resignation July 24 to accept
responsibility for the governing Liberal Democrats' unprecedented
losses in a parliamentary election the day before.
   In those elections for half the seats in the two-chamber body's
upper house, the governing party lost its majority for the first
time since the party was formed in 1954. Much of the vote against it
went to the Socialists, Japan's leading opposition party.
   Uno had taken office June 2, after Noboru Takeshita stepped down
to take responsibility for the Recruit affair, a widespread
influence-buying scandal that forced three Cabinet ministers to
resign and led to over a dozen arrests.
   Soon after becoming prime minister, however, a report in the
weekly Sunday Mainichi magazine charged that Uno had paid a geisha
to be his mistress and then mistreated her. The woman later told her
story on national television, seriously damaging Uno's public image.
   The Recruit scandal, along with a new sales tax, unpopular
agricultural policies and the sex scandals have created what
governing party leaders acknowledge is the conservative party's most
serious crisis ever.
   Analysts believe the party could also suffer major setbacks in
elections for the more powerful lower house, which chooses the
nation's prime minister. Though such elections need not be held
until July 1990, political pressure from the opposition-controlled
upper chamber could force them to be called sometime this year.

   An archbishop in northern Mexico says he will
lead miners in a peaceful takeover of a copper mine to protest the
government's decision to close it rather than give in to workers'
demands, news reports said Wednesday.
   Carlos Quintero Arce, archbishop of Hermosillo, made the
declaration during a Roman Catholic Mass for 2,800 workers of
Cananea, Mexico's biggest copper mine, which now is guarded by 3,000
troops.
   The government-owned mining company declared bankruptcy Sunday,
saying it cannot afford union demands for a 330 percent increase in
wages and benefits.
   The government plans to sell the mine to private investors. It is
about 25 miles from the Arizona border.
   Quintero Arce told a congregation Tuesday night that the Roman
Catholic Church ``is one with those who suffer, in this case (for)
the workers who bear no responsibility for the suppposed bankruptcy
of the mining company.''
   He criticized the government for sending in troops.
   ``This is no way to treat the miners,'' he was quoted as saying.
``They are not criminals.''
   The government says the soldiers, deployed Sunday when the
bankruptcy petition was granted, are guarding explosives at the mine.
   The archbishop said he is ready to lead the miners and their
families when they attempt a peaceful takeover of Cananea on Sept. 6.
   There have been no confrontations between the locked-out miners
and soldiers while miners have conducted several marches and
meetings outside the mine gates.
   ``I don't think the troops will touch the workers,'' Napoleon
Gomez Sada, head of the national miners' union, was quoted as saying
in the Mexico City daily La Jornada.
   Government officials say if Cananea is not sold to private
investors and reopened within a year there will be a national
shortage of copper. The mine produced 123,600 tons of copper last
year.
   Two deals to sell the indebted company have fallen through since
1988.

   Police arrested five men suspected in the
assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, the presidential hopeful whose
slaying sparked a government crackdown on Colombia's notorious drug
traffickers.
   Also Tuesday, police said they had started proceedings to
extradite the reputed finance chief of the Medellin drug cartel to
the United States, where he faces conspiracy and drug trafficking
charges.
   The arrests in Galan's slaying created additional security
headaches for a nation under a years-old campaign of terror by drug
traffickers and their hired hitmen. The arrests in downtown Bogota
appear to reflect an unusual efficiency on the part of security
forces. Never before in a major drug-related assassination had
police announced key arrests with such speed. In many cases no
arrests were ever made.

   ``This plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm to

said Tuesday. By February, Ms. Chasis said, there still will be oil

   The extent of damage on species such as the bald eagle and salmon

<HEAD>`Pat Sajak Show' Profitable Despite Low Ratings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is Pat Sajak about to meet the same fate as a
legion of challengers who assaulted the ramparts of Johnny Carson's
late-night kingdom?
   ``The Pat Sajak Show'' premiered on CBS last Jan. 9, and after a
brief honeymoon with the audience fell into the ratings doldrums
that defeated Carson rivals from Les Crane to Dick Cavett to Alan
Thicke to Joan Rivers.
   Sajak has not only failed to lure viewers away from Carson, he
faces his own serious challenge from Arsenio Hall. Although ``The
Arsenio Hall Show'' is syndicated and does not compete directly
against Sajak, his ratings have been running behind those for Hall.
Another problem is that Hall's show is a favorite of the young
audience most prized by advertisers.
   Sajak is also behind ABC's ``Nightline'' and NBC's ``Late Night
With David Letterman.'' In addition, it's slightly behind the
ratings CBS had last year for a mixture of late-night shows.
   Reportedly, CBS executives said they would kill the show if the
ratings didn't improve by the end of the year. Some people are
starting to write Sajak's obituary. But according to sources at CBS,
as in the case of Mark Twain's reported death, the reports may be
greatly exaggerated.
   ``As far as I know, there's no ticking clock,'' said Sajak. ``I
honestly don't know what their expectations are. My department is
doing the show, not worrying about the ratings.
   ``I have no control on the ratings. I do have control over seeing
that the show is good and I think in time that will affect the
ratings. We had no illusions about going in and knocking anybody off
and becoming an overnight sensation. It doesn't work that way in
late night. We said from the beginning we'd get an early splash out
of curiosity, then people would settle into their old viewing habits
and in the long haul we would bring them back.''
   An important point, perhaps the crucial point, is that the Sajak
show is making a profit for CBS.
   ``The fact that Sajak is running behind NBC and ABC and even
behind what CBS had last year certainly generates a discussion of
how long we'll hang in,'' said David Poltrack, CBS senior vice
president for planning and research. ``On the other hand, the show
is highly marketable. Even with the low ratings the advertising
rates are higher and the spots are selling well.''
   Poltrack said an increase in the audience would make the Sajak
show ``a major moneymaker.''
   ``It is a show that has already improved our revenue picture,''
he said, ``and has the potential of improving our profitability
dramatically if it can develop a larger audience. That suggests
patience and an investment of time and energy to get it right.''
   Part of the show's profitability undoubtedly is due to the fact
that a talk show is cheaper to produce than the action-adventure
shows it replaced.
   Rod Perth, CBS' newly appointed vice president for late-night
programming, said he has not received any ultimatums.
   ``I would not have taken this job to get involved in a project
that the network did not have confidence in,'' said Perth. ``Nobody
gave me any mandate. The way this business works is I think if
people are competitive they want to make things work and work well.
That's my personal mandate.''
   Perth said he was too new to the job to say what changes he will
make in the Sajak show to improve its ratings.
   ``All of these shows evolve,'' he said. ``Of course, there are
things being discussed. We feel this show has the potential, and
anything that's a living, breathing, five-day-a-week entity has to
evolve. We have every confidence in Pat Sajak.''
   The Sajak show has been undergoing some changes in an effort to
attract more viewers.
   ``We've been fiddling with the show from the beginning,'' said
Sajak. ``But we're not going to imitate Oprah Winfrey and wander
into the audience looking for lesbian nuns. We've played around with
various elements, but I think the show is basically the same as it
was when we went on the air. I signed up for an
entertainment-oriented talk show and that's what I'm doing.''
   Perth, who said as a broadcaster he would not be happy until he
was No. 1, added, ``I would ask people to remember this show entered
the most competitive time period in television against the most
entrenched competition in television. You have to put expectations
at a reasonable level.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Already Assigning Blame for Possible Recession</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hedging a bet, the White House seems to be
taking out some political insurance against the risk of a recession
next year. Should there be a serious slump, the Republicans will
blame the Federal Reserve Board.
   The administration long ago declared that the old theory of
business cycles, up then down, no longer need apply to the U.S.
economy. At least it hasn't applied since early in Ronald Reagan's
presidency. The longest period of economic expansion in peacetime
history began in 1982 and continues now.
   President Bush said as a candidate that he could keep it going
with policies that restrain spending and forbid new taxes. ``After
all, economic growth doesn't die out from old age, it is smothered
by bad policies,'' he said last Oct. 24.
   Picking up the theme, with some of the same words, an
administration economic spokesman said on July 10 that the
record-long expansion could be sustained, with the outlook favorable
for continuing growth ahead.
   ``Economic history teaches us that expansions have not died of
old age, but were killed by policies _ usually monetary policies _
which with the benefit of hindsight were unfortunate mistakes,''
said Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darby.
   Translated, that argument holds that it's usually the Federal
Reserve Board that stalls or scuttles economic expansion by clamping
too tightly on the money supply and pushing up interest rates.
   That's the issue that prompted Budget Director Richard G. Darman
to chide the central bank for tightening interest rates because of
what he said may have been excessive concern about renewed inflation.
   ``If we do have a recession it will be because they have erred on
the side of caution,'' Darman said Aug. 13 on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' ``I think it's quite important that the Fed appreciate that
growth is indeed fundamental to the health of this economy, and that
they not become too obsessed with concern about things going too
well for too long.''
   Bush endorsed those comments. ``I think I've said essentially the
same thing in the past,'' Bush said. He called Darman's comments
balanced, although he dodged the question of whether he agreed that
the Fed would be responsible for any recession.
   ``Listen, I don't know of any president, now or in the past, who
doesn't favor lower interest rates,'' Bush said. ``... That's the
American way.''
   Trying to chart a course between the risks of inflation on one
side and recession on the other, the Fed began increasing interest
rates in March 1988 and pushed up short-term rates by three
percentage points over the next year. Then, early in June, it began
edging rates downward to stimulate economic activity and avoid a
severe slump.
   Its policy-making committee met on Tuesday and decided how to
proceed for the next six weeks. Those policy decisions will not be
disclosed until Oct. 6, although their impact could show in the
marketplace. Current guessing is that interest rates will be left at
or near current levels into the fall.
   As Bush noted, strains between the central bank and the White
House are nothing new. Lower interest rates serve the political and
budget agendas of most presidents. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, knows all about that. He was an economic
adviser to Richard M. Nixon during the 1968 campaign. He served as
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors when Gerald R. Ford was
president. Reagan appointed Greenspan chairman of the Fed.
   The seven governors of the Federal Reserve are appointed for
14-year terms; the chairmanship is for five years, tenure that is
supposed to provide political insulation.
   That seems to work. In the past there have been times of real
tension between the Fed and expansion-bent presidents and
Congresses. This season's differences have been polite by comparison.
   Shortly after he was inaugurated, Bush said Greenspan seemed to
be worrying more about inflation than he was. After the Fed raised
interest rates in February, the president said they differed on the
right way to interpret economic indicators regarding possible
inflation.
   But Greenspan has warned that inflation itself can trigger
recession. ``If inflation emerges, I think a recession will move up
on us much more quickly than we can imagine, and when it occurs it
will be a prolonged one,'' he told Congress early this year.
   In congressional testimony last month, he said that while the
risk may have shifted somewhat away from inflation, the rate still
is too high. The administration says the inflation rate is headed
downward, and that interest rates should therefore be eased.
   ``Some day, some event will end the extraordinary string of
economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982,'' Greenspan
has warned.
   That always has happened before. The administration isn't
conceding that it will again, at least not soon. But if it does, the
blame has been assigned in advance.

   Along with their classroom schedules, many
students heading to college in the next few weeks will be getting
real-life introductory lessons in personal money management.
   By hallowed tradition, the main financial challenge most college
students face is a chronic shortage of funds.
   But the course description includes other assignments as well _
including dealing with unfamiliar financial institutions and
safeguarding possessions away from home.
   ``For many, moving away from home to attend college marks the
first big step toward adult independence,'' says the Credit Union
National Association, a trade group with more than a passing
interest in the subject.
   ``Part of this growth process involves taking control of your own
financial affairs.''
   To start with, most financial advisers agree, a simple
one-step-at-a-time approach is likely to be best.
   All the offers of credit cards, banking services and other
promotional material handed out during orientation week don't have
to be dealt with right away.
   ``If you're a typical student, you don't have a lot of money and
you probably won't make frequent use of the few financial services
you'll need,'' CUNA advises.
   ``Look for services that provide the features you want, but won't
penalize you for infrequent use.''
   Students also may not have to spend a lot of money insuring their
everyday possessions such as clothing, radios and bicycles against
theft.
   If a student's parents have a homeowners' policy, the Insurance
Information Institute notes, it probably already covers property
that might be stolen away from home, up to a specified limit.
   For example, the institute says, a typical policy covering a
house for $100,000 would give the student $5,000 coverage at school,
minus any deductible.
   Still, this bears verifying beforehand for any families who are
uncertain what their policies say. And if a student is taking
anything of significant value along _ jewelry, say, or a personal
computer _ an insurance agent should be consulted to determine
whether special coverage is required.
   Should a student open a checking account? It's a good idea, the
insurance institute says, because cash lying around a dorm room in
any amount is prime prey for theft.
   The checkbook, furthermore, should be kept in a safe place. So
should the automatic teller machine card that comes with most of
today's accounts.
   College-age consumers seem to have developed a special affinity
for the convenience ATMs offer. According to CUNA, people 18 to 24
years old use ATMs more often than any other age group.
   And a credit card? A generation ago, a student might have had a
lot of trouble getting one. Today he or she is more likely to be
inundated with application forms.
   That can be a nice extra. Or it can mean potential trouble for
people taking on new responsibilities in a new place without much
experience in managing money.
   ``Having your own credit card is a good way to begin to establish
your credit history, and it is useful in emergencies,'' CUNA says.
``Be sure not to abuse the convenience, though, or you could damage
your creditworthiness for years.''

   With the economy shuffling along, and with
economists focused on whether we'll have a recession, there's a
tendency to think that good news doesn't exist.
   It does. Many of the published economic forecasts say inflation
is likely to remain restrained for the time being, that home
mortgage rates could resume their fall, and that most jobs seem
secure into next year.
   It also seems likely that interest rates aren't going to go to
the sky _ it was only a few months ago that such talk sounded
plausible _ and that means an opportunity for Americans to
straighten out their finances.
   It's a buyer's market in many items; compare that with the 1970s,
when prices and interest rates rose so fast that consumers almost
trampled each other to buy before more increases came. By
comparison, these days are serene.
   If you want to look into the future, there are seers who say even
better times are coming in the 1990s, a viewpoint that often becomes
submerged by the tide of foreboding about budget and trade deficits
and Third World loans.
   These optimists about the decade to come cite improvements in
business that make it more efficient, global competition that will
tend to keep prices in line, and the opening of big new consumer
markets, in Asia, for instance.
   But you do not need to go that far into the future to find good
news. Some is mixed with bad, of course, and that makes it harder to
find, but it's there if you want to search. There's gold in the
gravel.
   Amidst a generally bleak picture, for example, there are signs
that some areas of health care costs might finally be submitting to
control. And while doctors still quit rather than risk medical
malpractice, there are signs of a corrective process. The
beginnings, anyway.
   Doctors have learned to avoid some of the incidents that lead to
malpractice claims, to document their motives and methodology, to
communicate better with patients _ even to adjust their bills.
   At the same time, tort reform is reducing the number of cases
brought to court. States are putting caps on claims. Juries are
becoming more aware of the societal costs of litigation and are
cutting back on extravagant awards.
   You might also have thought that foreigners, mainly Japanese,
were buying up America. That's a recurring bad-news theme, a hot
one, a theme that lends itself to such phrases as the selling of
America and economic invasion.
   But America hasn't been sold. Smart foreign investors did, in
effect, let Americans use their money in return for some assets, but
a report from the National Realty Council, made up of real estate
owners and operators, shows they own only about 1 percent of
America's $12 trillion worth of real estate. And the Japanese
weren't the big investors; the British were.
   So what's all the fuss about? Two things: The Japanese did invest
a lot of money in America during the 1980s, and they forced Canada
into third place. Secondly, foreign investments were concentrated,
mainly in downtown areas.
   In 1987, for instance, the real estate firm of Coldwell Banker
estimated that foreigners owned 46 percent of office space in
downtown Los Angeles, 39 percent in Houston and 32 percent in
Minneapolis. Those are headline figures.
   But foreigners owned relatively little in Baltimore, Cincinnati,
San Diego and other large cities, and they owned very little of
America's geographical area. It's a big country, but the myth of
foreign ownership was even bigger.

   Gerald Smith has never seen a piano,
though he has made his living seated at one for 41 years, running
his fingers over the strings as well as the keys.
   Blind since birth, Smith began tuning pianos in 1948. He learned
his trade at the Tennessee School for the Blind in Nashville.
   ``I found out I was going to have to make a living some way or
another,'' Smith said. ``They taught you how to make brooms and they
taught you chair caning. I didn't think I could do either one of
them too good.''
   While playing the alto horn in the school band, Smith found piano
tuning more to his liking.
   ``In the band, you have to tune up, and I found out I could do
that pretty good,'' said the native of Jamestown, Ala. ``I had a
pretty good ear.''
   Smith's good ear and sensitive fingers have tuned keyboards for
the likes of Floyd Cramer, Ronnie Milsap, Johnny Cash and the
Nashville Symphony, as well as thousands of customers for the two
dealers he's worked for.
   The 62-year-old tuner is now semi-retired, spending three days a
week sharpening the sounds from uprights and grands. It takes him
about an hour to tune a piano.
   He makes his way easily among the instruments in a showroom,
identifying the make and model with a touch of his hand.
   ``When you tune a piano, it's just like being acquainted with
someone. The more you're around them, the better you know them. It's
just like an old friend,'' he said.
   Four decades in the tuning business has taught Smith that each
piano has a story behind it, as well. He can tell a lot about the
people who play them, even without meeting them.
   ``If you see dust on the keys up on this end and down on the
lower end, you know they haven't touched those keys in years, which
indicates they play little, simple songs,'' he said.
   ``If I sit down at a piano, run my fingers over the keys, I can
tell whether it's been tuned very often. I can tell if it needs
rebuilding or overhauling by the way the mechanical part feels.''
   Smith said his blindness has never caused disharmony with a
customer.
   ``I've never had anybody tell me, `Well, you're blind. I don't
think you can see to do the job good.'
   ``But you'd be surprised how stupid people are,'' he said,
laughing. ``They know I'm blind when I go in the door. I sit down
and start tuning the piano, and they ask me if I need the light
turned on.''
   He says he just tells them ``no'' and goes on working _ touching,
listening, running his hands along the 88 familiar keys.
   ``It's just like an old friend.''

   For 19-year-old Krzysztof Tulatycki,
selling stamps in a municipal post office is ``just another job,
like anywhere else.''
   But this particular post office, a few blocks from the center of
old Gdansk, is one of the two spots where the greatest conflagration
in history began.
   Before dawn on Sept. 1, 1939, German armored cars, artillery, and
police and SS detachments armed with flamethrowers surrounded the
main Polish Post Office in the Free City of Danzig and opened fire
on the 50 postal workers inside.
   At the same time, the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein, on a
``courtesy visit'' to Danzig, trained its heavy guns on a 182-man
Polish army garrison stationed on the Westerplatte peninsula in the
city's port area and started firing.
   Soon German dive bombers were over central Poland and tanks had
punched across the border at dozens of spots, heralding the start of
World War II.
   In late August 1939, Danzig was already filled with Nazi troops,
swastikas flew from buildings and young Polish men avoided the
streets for fear of being arrested, recalled Brunon Zwarra, a
70-year-old businessman who has written two books on the period.
   Although nominally independent under the post-World War I Treaty
of Versailles, Danzig _ known today by its Polish name, Gdansk _ had
been tied politically to the German Reich since Adolf Hitler's
National Socialists won control of the city government in 1933
elections.
   The mainly German-speaking Baltic port city, located at the mouth
of the Vistula River that flows through Poland, had been loyal to
Polish or Prussian kings at different turns in its history, usually
enjoying a degree of autonomy.
   Under the Versailles agreement, Danzig and the territory around
it was to be an independent buffer between Poland's newly created
corridor to the Baltic Sea and German-ruled East Prussia. Poland was
given jurisdiction over the city's customs administration, control
of its railroads and limited rights to operate a postal service in
the Free City.
   By 1939, harassment of the Polish officials by Danzig authorities
had turned the guarantees into a mockery.
   Nazi armaments were shipped to the city, and ethnic Poles, who
constituted less than 10 percent of the population, started to flee.
   A German-Polish non-aggression pact was abrogated by Hitler in
April 1939. The death knell of the uneasy peace sounded when Nazi
Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty Aug. 23.
   Zwarra, then 20, a Polish Danziger working for a German company
and having many German friends, saw the handwriting on the wall.
Poles of military age were being arrested on various pretexts, so he
asked a girlfriend to buy him a train ticket and bring it to him.
   Later, on the platform, plainclothes policemen stopped them. Only
when she lied that they were on their way to get married was he let
go.
   In this tense, nervous atmosphere, a small contingent of Polish
postal workers prepared to take their stand.
   The attack came at 4:45 a.m. The postal workers had secretly
armed themselves with rifles, and a reserve officer with military
training had been assigned to lead the defense. The postmen had been
told to hold out for six hours, when a Polish army rescue was
supposed to come. They fought for 14 hours, but the rescuers never
came.
   Five postmen were killed in the battle, two more were slain while
surrendering and about 30 others were executed in a Nazi prison in
October as ``partisans.''
   ``They were simple postmen, defending this plot of Polish soil in
such a heroic way,'' said Andrzej Januszajtis, a Gdansk physicist
and amateur historian. ``For them, it was just a piece of Poland.''
   It was an act of ``great patriotism, but why?'' asks Andrzej
Stanislawski, a retired journalist. ``We Poles are experts in this:
the more hopeless the situation ...,'' he answers, his voice
trailing off.
   Stanislawski, who escaped from the Majdanek death camp in 1944,
lectures on the destruction and reconstruction of Gdansk.
   On Westerplatte, the Polish garrison was outnumbered 20-to-1 but
held out seven days before surrendering.
   It has become a patriotic shrine. Visiting heads of state are
ritually escorted by Poland's leaders to lay wreathes at the base of
the 75-foot-tall granite obelisk memorializing the defenders.
   The monument is the focus of anniversary observances, but the
post office has been less remembered.
   The bombarded and burned building was reconstructed after the
war. One half of the lobby is a museum, and the other half remains a
post office serving the neighborhood. A plaque outside recalls the
postal workers; inside on display is a pre-war Polish mail box
pocked by bullets.
   There is a steady stream of curious visitors, including German
tourists, Tulatycki said.
   He said the war's 50th anniversary does not signify much to him,
but it will be meaningful for his family, especially since his
grandfather was put to death by the Germans for being a communist.
   ``I have a somewhat different view,'' said the young man who came
of age in the era of Solidarity, the movement born in the Lenin
shipyard seven blocks away.
   But asked if he would have followed the example of the postmen
who sacrificed themselves, Tulatycki did not hesitate: ``I would
have done the same.''
   Troubled relations between Poland and Germany still touch Gdansk.
A long-discussed conciliatory visit to the rebuilt, now quite Polish
city by West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker for Sept. 1
observances was quietly scrapped amid lingering tensions over aid to
Poland and other issues.
   Poland's denial that it has a large German minority angers Bonn,
while Poles were irked recently when a leading West German
politician spoke of restoring Germany's 1937 borders, a move that
would erase a third of present-day Poland.
   But in a small token of friendship, Januszajtis said, Poles and
Germans are cooperating to restore a 37-bell carillon to a historic
Gdansk church.
   ``It is a great symbol (that is) very appealing to me. I would
like to close the stage of hatred,'' said the professor, whose
father died at the Auschwitz death camp.
   For Stanislawsji, ``We are a passing-away generation. The young
generation is not so involved in the past. We should look toward the
future.''

   World War II broke out on Sept. 1, 1939. Although full-scale
fighting did not begin until nine months later, the opening days of
September 1939 are not forgotten by those who lived through them.
   The Associated Press asked four of its present and former
correspondents for their memories of the war's first days.

   CLAUDE CASPAR-JORDAN, Paris, who was vacationing on the French
Riviera when a telegram summoned him to his cavalry unit:
   Tension grew minute by minute over the next days, until the
afternoon of Sept. 3, when I was with other military personnel in a
cafe near our barracks in Pontoise, outside Paris.
   A popular singer was crooning on the radio when the broadcast was
interrupted for the official announcement of the state of war by
Premier Edouard Daladier.
   His voice sounded strangled. We listened in a heavy silence,
staring at each other.
   In the following days, men arrived at the barracks. We started
getting our arms: revolvers, carbines, light machine guns, grenades,
one or two mortars, ammunition.
   Requisitioned cars, vans and trucks arrived driven by their
owners or chauffeurs. To their surprise, they were told they, too,
were being mobilized. They frantically phoned relatives who were
expecting them back.
   On Sept. 9, the regiment left town for the eastern front. There
had been no time to camouflage the vehicles. They included a cheese
delivery van featuring ``La vache qui rit,'' the laughing cow,
painted in vivid colors on its sides.
   My captain was silent, then suddenly said in a low voice, ``We
are going to the slaughter.''

   GRAHAM HEATHCOTE, London, who was walking down Whitehall with his
mother when Britain declared war on Germany:
   We were opposite the Cenotaph commemorating the dead of World War
I when Big Ben chimed 11 times.
   For about 20 minutes we did not know we were again at war with
Germany. Then we heard an air raid siren wail.
   A policeman shouted at us to go to a shelter, but we walked on
toward Victoria train station and, soon after, the siren sounded an
all-clear. My mother talked to me about the German Zeppelins which
came to bomb her in the Great War.
   When we got home to our village in Kent, my father said gloomily:
``Now we're for it.''
   At teatime the radio replayed Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain's broadcast announcing that Britain and Germany were at
war. He said, ``... My long struggle to win peace has failed. .. .
It is evil things that we shall be fighting against.''
   Later we learned that the first siren of the war was a false
alarm, triggered by an unidentified light plane in which a French
diplomat was crossing the English Channel.

   PHILIPPE NEURAY, Brussels, who was vacationing with his parents
and relatives in Saint Quay-Portrieux, a seaside resort in Brittany:
   A lasting image I have is of all the town's little fishing boats
suddenly returning to port after the signal station atop a cliff
fired its cannon to announce that war had broken out.
   Tension had been growing among the adults in my family and in the
village itself during the weeks leading up to Sept. 1. One of my
French uncles had already been drafted.
   The quiet atmosphere of Saint Quay-Portrieux's small railroad
station was usually disturbed only a few times a day, and then only
briefly, by the arrival of a wobbling steam train. But on Sept. 1 it
was packed with Frenchmen from the area who were being mobilized.

   RUDOLF E. JOSTEN, Berlin, who was an AP reporter in the German
capital when Hitler announced the war in a broadcast over radio and

   There was an unending string of official announcements: listening
to foreign radios was an offense punishable by eight years'
imprisonment; passing on their news was punishable by death. Private
cars and taxis were seized; there was no more gas for most others;
food ration coupons had already been issued.
   In the afternoon sirens sounded for what was said to be an air
raid drill. Later, stormtroopers patrolled the streets shouting at
every lit window. Air Marshal Goering, seeking to reassure the
people, said: ``If any enemy plane ever reaches Berlin, I will
change my name to Meyer,'' a remark that fueled bitter jokes when
Berlin was flattened by Allied bombs a few years later.

   Shoppers at Giant Food, the country's 12th
largest supermarket chain, are accustomed to getting a lecture with
the lettuce.
   ``Lower The Fat,'' cries a sign over the meat counter. ``Choose
chicken. Remove the skin. Eat more white meat than dark.''
   On shelf labels, arrows point out foods that are high in fiber or
low in fat and cholesterol. ``Eat for Health'' suggests a Giant
guidebook sold at the checkout, next to Soap Opera Digest. The
booklet gives hints for picking foods that may combat cancer.
   The signs and the pamphlets are the work of Giant's vice
president for consumer affairs, Odonna Mathews.
   As the customers' ombudsman, advocate and confidant, she is as
much a presence as the TV weather forecasters in the area served by
the chain, the District of Columbia and parts of Maryland and
Virginia.
   ``Everyone in the Washington area can tell you who Odonna is,''
marvels Lou Garcia of the Society of Consumer Affairs Professionals,
which represents 1,000 firms _ ``from Amoco to Zenith'' _ that have
consumer advisers. ``Not many of them have her kind of recognition.''
   The only woman among 22 Giant vice presidents, Mrs. Mathews
boasts she is free ``to openly disagree with company policies when
they are not in the consumers' best interest.''
   ``Some people think I'm a pain in the neck,'' she says. ``If I
am, I'm doing my job.''
   What Giant pioneered other stores are practicing. In northern
California and Nevada, the 54-store Raley's chain is a food safety
leader. The company requires fruit and vegetable growers to promise
they will shun pesticides, then subjects shipments to laboratory
tests to make sure the growers keep their word.
   Mrs. Mathews sees her job as making sure Giant offers customers
healthful choices _ and then nudging customers toward the right ones.
   After word came out about good fats and bad fats, she persuaded
Giant's bakers to forswear highly saturated palm and coconut oils in
baked goods, except for whipped toppings _ and she's working on that.
   Prodded by her own consumer boards _ on which customers volunteer
to serve, meeting four times a year _ she got Giant to create a
checkout lane in each store without candy to tempt kiddies. The
chocolate industry protested, in vain, she says.
   Giant customers are offered a choice between paper and plastic
bags. Those who contend plastic bags are environmentally unsound get
back a two-page reply on the dynamics of biodegradeabilty and
landfill chemistry. It boils down to, ``It is not so simple, but
we're studying the problem.''
   When Giant started selling live lobsters, two letters came from
customers squeamish about commiting death-by-boiling in their own
kitchens.
   So Mrs. Mathews consulted with the animal rights people, the
National Aquarium and the fish industry and wrote into a guidebook
two alternative ways of cooking the crustacean. (Go for the quick
kill by severing the spinal cord or start out with cool water, the
consensus being that the lobster feels less pain than when it is
plunged into boiling water.)
   Mrs. Mathews is a presence in Giant's newspaper ads and radio and
television commercials, offering and reinforcing common-sense advice
_ suggesting Halloween safety tips and ways to deal with high blood
pressure or proposing fruit-filled shredded wheat as an alternative
to fatty, sugary, low-fiber snacks.
   ``Make your snacks count,'' she advises.
   In an interview in Giant's nothing-fancy corporate headquarters
in an industrial warehouse neighborhood here, Mrs. Mathews spells
out her philosophy:
   ``People are going to eat their hot dogs and their chocolate
chips. But choices should be there. Consumers have the right to
choose, and they have the right to be informed.''
   Twenty thousand times a year, Giant customers write or call her,
to ask for a recipe or to complain about a checkout clerk who packed
the eggs in the bottom of the bag.
   Mrs. Mathews shops at Giant, of course, but is not above
occasionally sneaking into a competitor's store. ``I've never had
anyone recognize me yet,'' she says.
   She started as an intern to the company's first consumer adviser,
Esther Peterson, who held the post between stints as White House
consumer adviser to presidents Kennedy and Carter.
   Guy Ford, who analyzes supermarket stocks for the Investment
Corp. of Norfolk, Va., says:
   ``Giant was ahead of the curve. The industry is just coming
around to what Giant's been doing for years.''
   The Food Marketing Institute says a third of 164 retailers who
took part in a 1987 survey reported they have established consumer
affairs departments. Forty percent of the consumer advisers report
to top management.
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a consumer group,
welcomes the trend.
   ``It is critical that the consumer adviser be allowed to
participate in the top councils of the company, as does Odonna, and
that they not be sanctioned for expressing unpopular opinions,'' she
says. But even then, she says, society will always need the
viewpoints of outside consumer critics such as herself.
   Analyst Kimberly Walin of the securities concern of Prudential
Bache says what Mrs. Mathews does is also good business:
   ``The costs are not that high and the goodwill between Giant and
the community is great.''
   Mrs. Mathews agrees. ``Everyone sells chicken,'' she says, ``but
not everyone sells a visit to the supermarket that can be pleasant.''
   She must be right. With 147 stores, Giant enjoys net profit
margins of more than 3 percent of sales, well above the industry
average of 0.71 percent. Giant's sales, nearing $3 billion a year,
have doubled in eight years.
   For all that, Mrs. Mathews pushes advice that might make many a
profit-minded grocer blanch.
   Three ounces of meat in a serving, she says, is really enough;
``slice the meat thinly and fan it out on the plate.''
   Or, in a pamphlet for older shoppers: ``Buy basic foods rather
than convenience products. ... Quick rice costs more than regular
rice. Buy plain frozen foods rather than fancy mixed dishes or
butter sauced vegetables.''
   Mrs. Mathews has one last trick. She sends a newsletter on
health, nutrition, diet and exercise to all Giant store managers and
executives. Get them thinking healthfully, she reasons, and they'll
push those thoughts at their customers.

<HEAD>Moluccans Still Await Repatriation in Dutch Camps</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VUGHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty years after the Netherlands lost
the pearl of its East Asian empire, thousands of its former colonial
subjects still live in exile here, awaiting repatriation to their
own nation that never came to be.
   Camp Lunetten in Vught is the last of 74 resettlement camps
established to house Moluccan troops who fought for the Dutch in
their losing war with rebels in the 1940s in what then was the Dutch
East Indies and now is Indonesia.
   Lunetten, a former Nazi concentration camp, is the Netherlands'
most visible symbol of Moluccan nationalist aspirations, despite the
fact that their homeland, a sprinkling of islands west of New
Guinea, was long ago swallowed up by Indonesia.
   The 220 Moluccans still living in the ramshackle brick buildings
maintain it is their symbol of defiance against the Dutch, whom they
say reneged on a pledge to secure them an independent Moluccan
nation.
   ``As long as we don't have our own nation, we're just living from
one day to the next. We'll always be Moluccans,'' said 30-year-old
Ety Huliselan, who was born, raised and still lives in Camp Lunetten.
   ``We've always been homesick here. It's not our country but a
strange country,'' said her 61-year-old father Johannes, a former
private in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army.
   Despite assimilation and the passage of four decades, most
Moluccans still hold to the vision of an independent homeland,
according to current and former Dutch government officials.
   The Dutch government says it promised only to do its best to
secure a Moluccan homeland and that political realities have since
ruled out such an effort.
   Moluccan resentment exploded into terrorism in the 1970s when
Moluccan nationalists seized a school, two trains and the Indonesian
Consulate in Amsterdam. The attacks left 11 people dead.
   When the Indonesian separatists defeated the Dutch in 1949, the
Moluccans proclaimed their own Republic of the South Moluccas.
   To save them from possible Indonesian reprisals, however, the
Dutch evacuated about 4,000 Moluccan troops and 8,500 dependents to
the Netherlands in 1951.
   In all, about 45,000 Moluccans now live in the Netherlands, many
still torn between their families' authoritarian traditions and the
more liberal Dutch culture.
   Moluccan drug abuse and Dutch-language illiteracy rates far
exceed the national average, and their unemployment rate of up to 60
percent is four times higher.
   Successive Dutch governments have tried to integrate the
Moluccans into Dutch culture but have also given them more
preferential treatment than any other ethnic minority in this nation
of 14.6 million.
   ``These people have been pampered by the state for years,'' said
Maurice van Hurck, the Welfare Ministry official responsible for
Lunetten. ``They're looking for an enemy on which to vent all their
aggression and the enemy is the Welfare Ministry.''
   Until 1956, all Moluccans lived in camps, where they were issued
free food and clothing. Since then, the government has built them
2,800 rental units and about 50 churches in a program that has no
parallel even in the generous Dutch welfare state.
   A $6.9-million Vught housing project designed along the
organizational lines of Moluccan village stands virtually empty
because Lunetten's residents refuse to move.
   The residents maintain their camp has great symbolic value in
their fight and maintain that leaving it would imply giving in on
their position that they're victims of government neglect.
   Van Hurck said rents in the camp start at the Dutch guilders
equivalent of only $8 a month, and gas, electricity and water are
free. Rents in the new housing complex start at $90 a month, which
is still very low by Dutch standards. Gas and electrical services
for a Dutch household run $90-$180 a month, depending on the size of
the home.
   The Moluccan nationalist movement, which has a
president-in-exile, 79-year-old Johannes Manusama, provided the
Moluccans with a ``new foothold to hang on to their pride,'' said
Annelies Kouwenhoven, a specialist on Moluccan culture.
   ``It's the teaching of a lifetime to Moluccans that the entire
Moluccan culture be transferred from father to son, from mother to
daughter,'' said Mrs. Kouwenhoven, former secretary of the
Dutch-Indonesian Joint Committee on Moluccan Affairs.
   Some Lunetten resident claim they were never officially
demobilized from the Dutch army and are owed 38 years' back pay by
the Dutch government.
   The government has paid for Moluccan youths to travel to the
Moluccan islands so they could choose between life under Indonesia
and life in the Netherlands.
   Only a few have opted for the Moluccas, according to Mrs.
Kouwenhoven.
   Lena Dejong, 32, a second-generation Moluccan woman married to a
Dutchman said young Moluccans continue to profess a belief in
Moluccan nationalism only out of respect for their elders.
   ``We're used to so many things here,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Two years ago, Sergei Grigoryants was in a Soviet
labor camp, ostracized and imprisoned by his government for what it
called slander.
   Today, he is among a new breed of globe-trotting Soviet activists
flocking to the West to pitch their causes, attend seminars, meet
government leaders and finally shake hands with people whose
stubborn support kept many of them going.
   Unlike Soviet tourists and emigrants, these activists also are
forging new contacts with people who will support them when they
return home. Along the way they are amassing an arsenal of donated
computers, printers and FAX machines to open new, electronic windows
on the once-closed Soviet society.
   The number of activists visiting the West has soared since 1986,
the year after President Mikhail Gorbachev launched his reforms.
They range from veteran Moscow dissidents who spent years in jail
for their beliefs to pro-independence Baltic activists spurred by
Gorbachev's programs.
   Nearly every top leader of the three independent ``popular
front'' groups in the Baltic republics has visited Europe, the
United States or Canada in the last year. Leading Moscow activists
such as Lev Timofeyev and Sergei Kovalyov have crossed both
continents, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov has
returned to the West twice since his first visit last year.
   But Soviet authorities still tightly control travel visas for
personal and business trips, leaving wide speculation about the
Kremlin's motives for allowing activists to ply their trade freely
abroad.
   ``I'd shy away from conspiracy theories, but it obviously builds
up Gorbachev's reputation. He obviously believes enough in his
reforms to allow this,'' said Ginte Damusis of the Lithuanian
Information Center in New York.
   ``Gorbachev wants to appear as a peaceful ... law-abiding
figure,'' said Ludmilla Thorne, Soviet affairs director at the New
York-based human rights organization Freedom House. ``They don't
want bad publicity.''
   Jeri Laber, executive director of Helsinki Watch in New York,
suggested the Kremlin simply is less concerned about activists'
influence. ``Somebody there has realized it's not so bad when these
people speak out.''
   A Soviet Embassy spokesman in Washington said only that Kremlim
policy on visas for travel to the West doesn't discriminate between
activists and all other Soviet travelers, whose total number could
reach 2 million this year.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, president of the Lithuanian independence
movement Sajudis, said he didn't know why authorities let him visit
the United States and Europe, but that he had more important things
on his mind.
   ``There is an opportunity to maintain contacts, to establish new
contacts,'' the 56-year-old musicologist said through an interpreter
last month in New York. ``I hope that Sajudis will be known not just
by name only, but as a very real movement and representative of its
people, its nation.''
   Landsbergis, who became an activist only in the last two years,
said his trip reaffirmed Sajudis' rejection of Soviet authority,
imposed on the Baltics under a 1939 pact signed by Josef Stalin and
Adolf Hitler.
   ``We're raising questions about the authority of our
representatives abroad. Can we expect emigres or other governments
to represent us?''
   He met with State Department officials, congressmen, a former
White House policymaker and Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO,
which has appointed a representative to deal with Lithuania's
fledgling independent labor union.
   Just a few weeks before, the 48-year-old Grigoryants met with
Vice President Dan Quayle and other officials and activists and
signed an agreement with Freedom House to fax daily installments of
his journal to America.
   Grigoryants, the Georgian publisher of the journal Glasnost, was
freed in 1987 after four years in a labor camp for publishing an
underground journal. He formally came to America to accept the
Golden Pen of Freedom Award from the International Association of
Independent Journalists.
   A State Department spokeswoman would not comment on any of the
meetings, saying only that U.S. policy is to meet with all Soviet
activists.
   ``One of their intentions for contacts with the West is to be so
well known that if a crackdown came, they'd be well known enough to
protect themselves,'' said Martin Zvaners of the American Latvian
Association in Washington. ``The fact that these people are coming
to the West, showing their faces, gives (Westerners) a stake
personally in their fate.''
   The activists also are ``seeing us working and they get an idea
about how they could work. They see participation in a real
parliamentary democracy,'' said Robert Van Voren, director of the
Bukovsky Foundation in Amsterdam.
   But ideas and contacts aren't the only things activists take home.
   Grigoryants handed Thorne a list of supplies, from staples to
computers, for his Moscow office, which was stripped by KGB agents
and Internal Security forces last year. Thorne said she wasn't sure
if all his requests were filled, but that his wife, Tamara, earlier
in the year had carried a personal computer back to Moscow after
visiting the West.
   Landsbergis picked up a desktop publishing system with which
Sajudis hopes to put out a daily newspaper from Vilnius, the
Lithuanian capital.
   Baltic, Armenian and Georgian activists regularly use fax
machines they got from the West to send dispatches to Western
activists, the recipients said.
   ``One fax can perform miracles,'' said Eduard Gudava, executive
director of the New York-based Center for Democracy in the U.S.S.R.
``They can stop all this travel. ... But they cannot cut all the
telephone lines.''
   The center receives daily dispatches from the human rights
journal Express-Khronika and translates them for Western media. Such
independent reporting will make Moscow think twice before sending
troops against protesters, Gudava said.
   ``It's impossible now to keep information inside the Soviet Union
about such things,'' he said.
   Still, nothing can replace face-to-face contact, said Van Voren.
``They would be doing their jobs even without these trips. But it's
easier to discuss things in person _ you know, they still have bugs
in their offices.''

   Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were
taking a break while putting the finishing touches on their new
album a few weekes ago, and they once again heard a TV announcer
refer to the Rolling Stones as ``the greatest rock 'n' roll band in
the world.''
   They've been blessed, or cursed, with the label for about 20
years. The pair tested each other's memory to find who first pinned
the phrase on the band, finally settling on a former tour manager
who doubled as a public address announcer during the 1960s.
   ``It's a title. You wouldn't claim it, but if it's bestowed upon
you, you'd say `thank you very much,''' Richards said. ``I would
never call us that.
   ``Some nights we are, some nights we ain't.''
   Nearly 3 million people hope they'll catch the right nights as
the Stones embark on their first U.S. tour since 1981 and release
their 34th album, ``Steel Wheels,'' a surprisingly strong effort if
only because of the considerable doubt the band would ever record
again.
   The Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who were a golden troika
of British rock supergroups in the '60s, but only Jagger, Richards
and crew have survived until today as a creative force.
   The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame members boast a catalog that began
with such radio hits as ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' and
``Let's Spend the Night Together,'' matured with seminal rockers
``Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and ``Brown Sugar'' and boogeyed through the
'70s and '80s with ``It's Only Rock 'n' Roll,'' ``Miss You'' and
``Start Me Up.''
   But until a fateful summit in Barbados last February, it appeared
the story of the Rolling Stones was drawing to a close.
   Jagger and Richards, the unquestioned leaders of this five-member
band, had been conducting a public feud the likes of which haven't
been seen in rock since John Lennon and Paul McCartney sniped at
each other on record in the early '70s.
   It centered on the restless Jagger's desire to record and tour
separately from the band. The fiercely proud Richards, who guards
the Rolling Stones' reputation like a museum curator, thought
Jagger's priorities weren't straight.
   ``There were a couple of dodgy months during the last seven years
when I thought it didn't look too bright on the horizon,'' admitted
guitarist Ron Wood during a series of recent interviews with The
Associated Press at a Long Island hotel, close to where final
rehearsals were taking place for the tour.
   Jagger and Richards, after months of talking to each other
through the press, had a face-to-face meeting in Barbados and
eventually set to work, writing 20 to 30 songs together.
   Richards laughs nervously at descriptions of his relationship
with Jagger as an uneasy truce. ``It's far more simple and far more
complex,'' he said in a weary rasp ground down by cigarettes.
   It seems they've simply agreed to disagree.
   Jagger, his thin, wiry body coiled like a rubber band on a hotel
suite chair, peppers his conversations with references to the Stones
as ``ancient.'' He bluntly replies, ``No,'' when asked if the Stones
still satisfy him creatively.
   ``I don't really know, he was just annoyed,'' Jagger said in
clipped tones when asked about his partner. ``You should ask him.
He's a very mood-swingy person. I'm fine with touring with the
Rolling Stones part of the time. I don't want it to be my whole
life. I think he learned over the period of time that it didn't have
to be his whole life as well.''
   Jagger, whose solo albums were unexpected flops, learned some
lessons as well. It's clear, he said, that some people can't accept
him as an artist outside the Rolling Stones.
   ``If Keith had sold like Michael Jackson figures, he would have
still been back in the Stones, he would have dropped everything to
come back,'' Wood said, mentioning Richards' solo record.
   ``What surprised me was that Mick didn't do those figures,'' Wood
said. ``That probably surprised him, too, and maybe it did make him
realize the strength of the band. Not that he didn't realize the
strength of the band, but once he and Keith ... spent some time
together in Barbados, they just realized the friendship was longer
and stronger than any paper or any magazine.''
   Jagger, Wood said, has ``come back into the band very genuinely
and we've made no compromises.''
   Although Jagger and Richards co-write most Stones songs, they've
actually done little writing together during the '70s and '80s, band
members said. ``Steel Wheels'' was different.
   ``The way we wrote these songs is very similar to the way we used
to work in the '60s, before we had to split up in the early '70s and
leave England and start to live apart from each other,'' Richards
said.
   Drummer Charlie Watts was called in after a few weeks to add
rhythm to the basic tracks recorded by Jagger and Richards, and bass
player Bill Wyman and Wood soon followed. The Rolling Stones, used
to interminable months of piecing songs together in the studio,
tried another novel concept before recording this time. They
rehearsed.
   ``It was such a bonus to do that, to know the arrangements,''
Wyman said. ``Then you can hone it down and really tighten up.
Before it was go into the studio, Keith's got some vague riff, Mick
mumbles some words and it becomes a song after five days.''
   Jagger said he wanted to replace a ``slovenly'' style of
recording with one more organized. Night owls Richards and Wood
curbed their tendencies to work into the early morning. And for all
of the worries about solo projects, the extra work left the Stones
in fighting trim, Richards said.
   Unlike the previous ``Dirty Work'' _ an album band members
privately criticize _ ``Steel Wheels'' shows more versatility than
the Stones have displayed in years. There's the required hard
rockers, but also a country-tinged ballad with fiddles, a tune
featuring Moroccan drummers and a grungy blues workout.
   ``The Rolling Stones were drifting into this rather boring rerun
of riffs past,'' Jagger said. ``I'm not saying everything on this
album is brilliantly original, but it does have some sparks of
ingenuity.''
   New songs ``Sad Sad Sad'' and the single ``Mixed Emotions'' are
among the 60 songs the band is rehearsing for its concert trek.
Other new songs will be worked in as the tour winds its way across
the country, band members said. It starts Aug. 31 in Philadelphia.
   Jagger, who's arrived onstage in past tours riding a giant
phallic symbol, and tossed flower petals from a cherry picker,
hesitated to talk about what audiences can expect this time. But
Wood and Richards spoke freely.

   Audiences can expect to hear some perennials, like ``Start Me
Up,'' ``Tumbling Dice,'' ``Sympathy for the Devil,'' ``Honky Tonk
Women'' and ``Gimme Shelter.'' The Stones have also dug deep into
the past for such gems as ``Ruby Tuesday,'' ``Paint It, Black,''
``Sweet Virginia'' and the 1967 psychedelic oddity, ``2,000 Light
Years From Home.'' Songs will be rotated in and out of the show so
it won't be the same every night.
   Wood described the concert as ``really showy. The stage is so
high we have to have FAA warning lights on top,'' he said.
   ``I'm really proud of them all this year,'' Richards said. ``Ever
since we got together in February it's been going like a dream. The
songs came up real easy and the boys in the rest of the band came in
and started playing like demons.''
   He said the Stones took out old records to try to recall the
original ideas behind the songs, rather than just remember the last
time they were performed live.
   ``We've done a lot of work, especially on the old songs,'' he
said. ``There's a lot more work gone into this tour and the record
than the Stones usually put into it, and very concentrated, too,
because it's all taken place since February when Mick and I sat down
and said, `Have you got any songs?'''
   Perhaps as a nod to Jagger, Richards doesn't want to talk about
the future of the Rolling Stones beyond the current tour. But he and
Wood make it clear they're not looking to retire this 27-year-old
band anytime soon.
   ``We'd be chicken not to follow this thing down the road now,
because nobody's taken it quite this far,'' Richards said. ``We've
been around a long while and we're still functioning. It's not like
the Beach Boys getting up there and doing all songs that they've
written 20-odd years ago, just a nostalgia trip. There's old stuff
and there's new stuff and hopefully it compares pretty well.''
   Will the Rolling Stones still be functioning in 20 more years?
   ``Yeah, I reckon,'' Wood said.

<HEAD>Keith Richards: You're Right, Music Isn't As Good Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's news for the Woodstock generation
who think rock music today just isn't what it used to be. Keith
Richards thinks you're right.
   ``The music thing is going through a lot of trauma,'' said the
Rolling Stones guitarist in a recent interview with The Associated
Press, during a break from rehearsals for their upcoming U.S. tour,
which begins Aug. 31 in Philadelphia.
   He agreed with respondents to a recent Media General-Associated
Press poll, who said by almost a 2-to-1 margin that the music of the
late 1960s topped the music of today in quality.
   ``The technology is becoming overwhelming,'' he said.
``Throughout the '80s, the record companies are saying, `Why bother
with things like musicians when you can just push a button here?'
   ``It's toytown,'' he continued. ``Everything goes around in
cycles, and I think in the '80s there's been a lot of confusion over
what to do with all of these possibilities and how to sort it out
and bring it back under control, to make it music again.''
   Not surprisingly, Mick Jagger disagrees.
   ``I don't think it's better,'' said the Stones' rubber-limbed
lead singer. ``It's just different. I think it's a banal question to
ask anybody.
   ``It's so subjective to an age group,'' said Jagger, who's spent
much of the '80s battling with Richards, his songwriting partner.
``If you are 19 now, whatever Bon Jovi record is still going to hold
that (memory) for you 20 years down the line. It's got nothing to do
with whether the band is any good or the song is any good, it's your
subjective experience with rock 'n' roll that counts, and I think
that's got a lot to do with the continuing popularity of these
ancient '60s bands.''
   Those stories about competitiveness between the Beatles and
Rolling Stones during the 1960s were true, Jagger said.
   ``It's very hard to come to terms with the fact that someone's
been around for so long,'' he said. ``You don't have very many
contemporaries still with you.
   ``There's no pressure, because there isn't anybody else giving us
any,'' Jagger said. ``The Who, since the death of Keith Moon, were
no longer the Who. It is a drag in a way, and not just in a
competitive sense.''
   Jagger and Richards can't pinpoint why this band of
fortysomething rockers are smashing attendance records across the
country this year. Four shows at New York's Shea Stadium sold out in
hours. Ticket-sale speed records were set in Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Boston, Toronto, Cincinnati and elsewhere.
   It's a lot of reasons, Richards said, not the least of which is
``it is a good band.
   ``There's people who have grown up with us, been with us all the
way,'' he said. ``Maybe it's because they don't know a world without
the Rolling Stones. There's the sun, the moon, the trees and the
Rolling Stones.''
   Two of today's hottest bands, Living Colour and Guns 'n' Roses,
will open various shows along the Rolling Stones nationwide tour
this fall.
   They're selected, he said, ``because there's a feeling that
they've been elected by the public and not by the (music) business.''
   Richards flashes his intense pride in his own band when asked if
the Stones feel competition from those hot, young sellers.
   ``You can't compete with this,'' Richards whispered, his face
contorting in a wicked laugh.

<HEAD>Toyota 4Runner Is An Obliging Toy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: 4Runner 4-Door 4WD all part of the name.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For anyone who played with toy Tonka trucks and dreamed about
what they would be like on real roads, there is an answer: the 1990
Toyota 4Runner 4-Door 4WD with V6 engine.
   This new 4Runner like an obliging toy will bound hills with ease,
slink down inclines in a stable, admiring way, and capably blaze
trails. Then, as many popular toys do, it will change personalities.
   For the ride home on regular roads, the 4Runner 4WD switches from
four-wheel-drive to two-wheel-rive with the touch of a gear shifter.
Here, the 3-liter, electronic fuel-injected V6 engine is truly
appreciated _ providing smooth, good acceleration in the test
vehicle, which also was equipped with a four-speed automatic
transmission. And, like all long-running toys, the 4Runner has a
reputation for durability.
   For the last three years, the 4Runner has finished first in its
class in J.D. Power &amp; Associates' compact truck satisfaction index.
In the most recent survey, in 1988, Toyota 4Runner owners said their
vehicle had few fit-and-finish problems at delivery, and they ranked
reliability high.
   The 1990 model is Toyota's first four-door version of the
4Runner, which has been sold in this country as a two-door since
late 1983. But more than just two doors have been added.
   The new 4Runner marks the second generation of the 4Runner and
features a more rounded exterior, an upscale interior, and
shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive that can be engaged in speeds of
up to 50 mph. It appears to be a new generation of promise.
   The test vehicle was capable where it counted on all kinds of
roads, over many kinds of bumps and holes, and at different speeds.
A new suspension, including a four-link coil spring system in the
rear, gave a stable feel to the handling, though Toyota warned in
its owner's manual that the 4Runner _ like all sport utility
vehicles _ maneuvers differently than a regular car and must be
driven carefully.
   The 4Runner had good ground clearance _ 10 inches _ to get over
rocks and stumps when off-roading. It came in handy, too, when
someone left a truck tire in the middle of a highway lane during the
test drive.
   Of course, the 4Runner's high profile _ the door handles were
above my waist _ also made for some interesting maneuvering of my
own as I scampered inside. Thankfully, getting out was easier, just
sliding, sliding, sliding down.
   Superb described the fit and finish inside and out. And Toyota
wants to make sure the vehicle stays in top form. The automaker uses
greater amounts of galvanized steel on the new model, a coated
frame, chip resistant paint, specially shaped rocker panels and
special wax coat on hinges to protect against the elements.
   Inside, the optional cloth sport seats in front, the decent
legroom in back and generally pleasant surroundings made the outside
elements seem distant.
   Even the inside roof was cloth-covered in the test 4Runner.
   The rear cargo area behind the split rear seat was nicely
carpeted, with attention given to carpeting the rounded tops of the
wheel wells back there. It was a spacious cargo area, even with the
rear seats not folded down.
   The rear window of the 4Runner slides down electrically with the
turn of the key in the rear door or from the inside with the touch
of a button on the center console next to the driver. There's also a
button on the console to lock the window, so it can't be
accidentally opened.
   The rear door folds down outward, is carpeted and makes a nice
shelf for tailgating at football games.
   But the 4Runner test vehicle wasn't cheap. Base price for the
1990 4Runner 4Door 4WD SR5 V6 _ the official name of the tester _
was more than $19,000, including automatic transmission. With
options and delivery charge, it totaled more than $22,000. And
that's without power windows, power locks and cassette player.
   In contrast, Ford said its large, two-door Bronco
four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle with six-cylinder engine,
three-speed automatic transmission, air conditioning and many other
options on the 4Runner would total about $18,000.
   You can find a lower-priced 4Runner _ with a manual transmission
and a four-cylinder engine _ with a base price of more than $15,400.
   Toyota expects the new 4Runner to attract a different crowd than
the previous one. Prior buyers were predominantly male with median
age of 32. Sixty-nine percent were married, 44 percent were college
graduates, and the average income was $44,000.
   Company spokesman Mike Michaels said Toyota expects the number of
women buyers to increase with the new model because it will be a
more attractive package for adventurous families. Michaels also said
Toyota expects to attract an older, higher-income crowd.
   Sales of 4Runners last year totaled 28,000 and had been tapering
downward for a couple years, Michaels said. But he added that Toyota
hopes to double, even triple sales once the new model takes hold.
   Consumer Report magazine did not have a listing for owner reports
on the 4Runner.

<HEAD>World War II Helped Farmers Climb Out of the Trenches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outbreak of World War II half a century ago
helped put American farmers on the high-tech course they follow
today. And it bailed them out of the Great Depression.
   Market prices for most commodities crept up in the months
following Germany's Sept. 1, 1939, invasion of Poland. The price of
horses, however, barely moved.
   President Roosevelt's secretary of agriculture, Henry A. Wallace,
advised farmers to proceed with 1940 production plans ``as if the
outbreak in Europe had not occurred.''
   The farm price of cotton in August 1939 averaged 8.7 cents per
pound. Corn brought less than 48 cents a bushel, and wheat was about
55 cents nationally, on the average.
   Horses were reported by USDA in the month before the start of
World War II at $78 per head.
   Six months later, in February 1940, the department reported the
farm prices of cotton at 9.97 cents per pound, corn at 55 cents a
bushel, and wheat at 84 cents per bushel.
   Horses gained only 20 cents, averaging $78.20 each in February
1940.
   Early predictions of demand for farm products remained guarded.
   ``European war has not stimulated, it has diminished, the export
demand for farm products,'' the March 1940 report said. ``United
States exports of tobacco and fruits have been greatly reduced.
   ``Exports of pork and lard are not up to the volume that would
flow normally in a year of large production and low prices. Export
sales of cotton have been good but have declined recently. Little
wheat is going abroad.''
   Some increases in U.S. domestic demand were reported as war
clouds deepened. But U.S. industrial production had not yet geared
up, and the outlook for agriculture was clouded.
   ``There seems little in the picture now that would justify any
expansion in farm production this year (1940) in excess of domestic
_ plus limited export _ needs for foods and fibers,'' USDA
economists intoned.
   But in May 1940, after the fall of France and as Britain's
tattered army prepared for its evacuation from Dunkirk, the USDA's
analysts reported:
   ``News comes of a quick change in the European political front
and yeast of commodity speculation rises. Wheat goes to highest
prices in three years, feed grains follow, hog prices climb, too.''
   Massive U.S. aid to Britain, including food and clothing, and a
buildup in American military forces would gradually put the United
States on a war footing. Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, settled any
remaining doubts.
   Doug Bowers, the department's historian, says World War II
brought epic changes to American agriculture.
   Since World War I in 1914-18, the main problem in U.S.
agriculture had been over-production, he said in a telephone
interview. But with the 1939-45 conflict, ``they needed full
production for wartime,'' Bowers said.
   ``This coincided with a very important change in American
agriculture,'' he said. ``That was the widespread adoption of
chemicals _ fertilizer and pesticides _ and also the continued
mechanization of agriculture.''
   The war didn't contribute directly to mechanization, simply
because factories that normally turned out tractors and combines
were building guns and tanks.
   ``But in the Midwest, for example, farmers who had never
fertilized before at all began using fertilizer on crops,'' Bowers
said. ``It began a long trend in upward productivity in American
agriculture.''
   There were domestic price controls and rationing during World War
II, he said. Even so, there was inflation as families sought
products for wartime incomes.
   ``The farmer came out of World War II in better economic shape
than he'd been in for a quarter of a century, since the end of World
War I,'' Bowers said.
   As the war drew to a close, there was some concern that
agriculture might suffer the same kind of collapse that happened in
the 1920s _ a harbinger of the Great Depression _ when the farm
economy was burdened by the loss of wartime markets and high prices.
   Government price supports were kept at relatively high levels
through World War II and for some time afterward, just in case, he
said. But U.S. aid to a war-torn world required a large output by
farmers. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 also was a factor.
   ``It wasn't until the mid-1950s that surpluses were a serious
problem again,'' Bowers said.
   By February 1943, with the allied invasion of Nazi-held Europe
still more than a year away, the economists at USDA noted that
``food production was expanded greatly'' in 1942 and that more was
needed.
   ``When the great victory drives in Europe and the Far East get
under way, food production will become more and more important in
relation to other war production,'' they said. ``Food requirements
will become acute with the liberation of Axis-occupied territories.''
   The report also showed the farm price of cotton at 19.7 cents per
pound, corn at 88 cents per bushel, and wheat at $1.18 per bushel.
   Horses were not included in the February 1943 agricultural
situation report. Tanks and tractors had taken their toll.

   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
tumbled 1.9 percent in July to the lowest level in nine months, the
government said, providing further evidence of a weakening economy.
   It was the fourth drop this year in the sector, which includes
items ranging from washing machines to warships that are expected to
last three or more years. The sector is considered a bellwether of
the economy's performance.

   A California company awarded a federal
contract Tuesday to clean up hazardous-waste sites faces a lawsuit
for alleged stock fraud and has been fined $4 million for
infractions at two landfills.
   The Army Corp of Engineers, which awarded the contract, was not
aware of the lawsuit or fines against International Technology
Corp., or ITX, until two weeks ago, when an aide to a Utah
congressman told the agency, said the aide, who asked that he and
the congressman remain anonymous.
   A spokeswoman at the Corps' Omaha office, Betty White, said ITX,
based in Torrance, Calif., had been audited and found ``able to
perform the work we want done.''
   The contract, the first of four to be awarded, could be worth $50
million over five years and entails cleaning up leaking barrels
containing PCBs, kerosene and other hazardous wastes at government
and private landfills nationwide. ITX performs similar work for the
state of California.
   ITX corporate counsel John Allen said the lawsuit and fines are
not relevant to the contract. Allen said the landfill fines were for
administrative violations.
   An attorney in the Corps' Omaha office, Ann Wright, said
companies bidding on the contract are required to disclose all
relevant information. Wright would not say if ITX disclosed the
lawsuit and fines in its bid.
   Allen said companies do not routinely disclose that kind of
information. ``It doesn't relate directly to your ability to provide
a service,'' he said.
   The lawsuit arose from a stock offering in late 1987 when ITX
sold 3.5 million shares to raise $47.5 million. ITX began issuing
the stock in September 1987 but announced that December that it was
closing its hazardous-waste transport and landfill operations, a
substantial part of the company's business.
   The lawsuit alleges that ITX planned to leave the landfill
business before issuing the stock but withheld the information from
the public.
   ``The stock was sold at an inflated price,'' said Ernest Kaufman,
an attorney for the plaintiffs. Kaufman said the suit seeks ``many
millions'' of dollars and represents thousands of people.
   Allen said the stock's price dropped with the rest of the market
during the October 1987 market crash. ITX stock hit $9 a share after
the market collapse. The stock sold for $13 to $14 a share when
issued.
   ITX's annual 10-K report said the Securities and Exchange
Commission is looking into the allegations.
   Five months before ITX issued the stock, the company agreed to
pay the California Department of Health Services $3.2 million in
fines for violations at two landfills the company owned. This past
June, ITX paid another $900,000 fine because it underestimated the
closure and post-closure costs of one of its landfills.
   An attorney for the California Health Services Department, Sue
Bertkin, said the 1987 fines covered several violations, including
disposing of hazardous wastes not identified in the company's
application, not gaining approval before increasing the capacity of
a landfill, and inadequate training of personnel.
   Officials from various California state agencies said none of the
violations threatened public health or the environment. The fines
are not unusual, said Health Services worker Rubia Bertram.

   Officials on Tuesday delayed for at least two
weeks the sale of refinancing bonds for two troubled nuclear
projects of the Washington Public Power Supply System after a New
York bank said it has a claim against the sale's proceeds.
   WPPSS _ which defaulted on $2.25 billion worth of bonds in 1983
in the biggest-ever municipal bond default _ planned this week to
sell $450 million worth of bonds that would yield an estimated 7
percent to 8 percent interest.
   The bonds would replace bonds sold early this decade at 10
percent to 15 percent interest for its nuclear plants Nos. 1 and 3,
said WPPSS spokesman John Britton.
   WPPSS, a consortium of utilities formed to build power plants,
estimates it will save an average of $70 million to $80 million a
year over the next 30 years through the refinancing.
   The sale would mark the first time WPPSS has sold bonds since the
default.
   The Nos. 1 and 3 plants sit partially completed at the Hanford
nuclear reservation and at Satsop, west of Olympia. Construction was
halted early this decade because of financing problems and doubts
about the need for new electricity sources.
   Late last week, Chemical Bank of New York wrote to the bond
trustees for Nos. 1 and 3, saying it had claims against the proceeds
of the refinancing bonds because of a federal court case involving
the two plants, Britton said.
   Chemical Bank is a trustee for investors who hold bonds in WPPSS
plants Nos. 4 and 5, which were terminated in 1982 when partially
built. It was these bonds that resulted in the WPPSS default.
   Chemical Bank is involved in an action in U.S. District Court in
Seattle in which it claims costs were misallocated between twin
plants Nos. 1 and 4, which sit on the same site at Hanford, and
between Nos. 3 and 5, which share the Satsop site.
   Because of their proximity and design similarities, certain costs
such as engineering work, access roads and some buildings were
shared by plants 1 and 4, and by plants 3 and 5, and those costs
were allocated to each plant according to a formula.
   Chemical Bank claims the formula misallocated some of those costs
to Nos. 4 and 5, and that the bondholders it represents stand to
gain up to $1 billion because of the incorrect billing.
   In May, a federal judge ruled that Chemical Bank does have a lien
against any costs that were misallocated to plants 4 and 5. However,
a decision has not been made on whether any costs were in fact
misallocated, Britton said.
   William Berls, a vice president for Chemical Bank's financial
services division, said Tuesday that the letter to the trustees for
Nos. 1 and 3 contained ``nothing new,'' and was intended solely to
make sure the trustees understood Chemical Bank's interest.
   The exact terms of the refinancing bond sale were to be set
Tuesday by the sale's underwriters, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Smith
Barney Harris Upham and Co., Britton said.
   The sale was scheduled for Thursday, Britton said.
   ``The lawyers are discussing the matter but our position hasn't
changed'' _ that Chemical Bank has no claim against proceeds of the
refinancing sale, Britton said.
   Britton noted that the cost-sharing litigation was covered in the
250-page disclosure statement WPPSS issued for the refinancing sale.

   When federal authorities handcuffed and arrested
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. trader Richard B. Wigton in front of his
colleagues, he was shocked.
   When he was charged on the basis of information supplied by
Kidder's former high-flying mergers specialist, Martin Siegel _ who
already had confessed to insider trading with Ivan Boesky _ he
thought: ``I can't believe that lying so-and-so.''
   The government did believe Siegel, but 2{ years after the
dramatic February 1987 arrest, prosecutors anounced they were
dropping their insider trading investigation of Wigton and a Kidder
colleague.
   Wigton, 59, a paunchy Wall Street veteran, said Tuesday he was
``not bitter _ angry is a better word'' about the episode that ended
with the government essentially saying he did nothing wrong.
   ``I'm not waiting for an apology. I don't think I'm going to get
it,'' Wigton told a news conference. ``At this point I just want to
put it all behind me.''
   ``The human cost was very bad for the first five or six months,
but with the support of my family and all my acquaintances and
friends, I just came to live with it, came to feel good about my
innocence,'' Wigton said.
   He said that if he encountered Siegel, who turned federal witness
after he was implicated by now-imprisoned speculator Boesky, today:
``I think at this point I'd turn my back and walk away.''
   The U.S. attorney's office last week ended its probe of Wigton
and Kidder co-worker Timothy Tabor. Former Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
arbitrager Robert Freeman, who also was arrested in the case, agreed
to plead guilty to one felony.
   Wigton, Tabor and Freeman were charged with violating securities
laws by making illegal securities trades using non-public
information, otherwise called insider trading. In May 1987, the
prosecutors voluntarily dropped the charges after a judge refused
the government more pretrial preparation time.
   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, now a New York mayoral
candidate who has said the timing of the arrests was a mistake,
indicated at the time that a new indictment would be brought. It
never was.
   ``To accuse somebody of a crime when all you have is the
uncorrobrated word of one man who himself is in trouble ... was just
a terrible injustice,'' said Wigton's attorney, Stanley Arkin.``They
simply went on (Siegel's) word, and they went swiftly without a
great deal of thoughtfulness.
   ``I think they had hoped their shock tactics would bring people
around to confessing and getting others,'' he said. ``The
misjudgment here was they had innocent people.''
   Arkin said he would not pursue a wrongful arrest case on Wigton's
behalf against the government because it would be ``a nearly
impossible case to mount legally.''
   Wigton began working on Wall Street in 1956 and rose to become
Kidder's head of arbitrage, the risky trading in the stocks of
takeover targets. He received investment advice from Siegel, the
firm's widely admired young mergers specialist.
   The arbitrage department's performance soared after Wigton and
Tabor began receiving advice from Siegel, but Wigton said at no time
did he suspect Siegel was passing them inside information.
   The U.S. attorney's office has said it is satisfied it believes
Siegel told the truth. Arkin said prosecutors never told him what
Siegel said.
   Wigton, who lives in the affluent suburb of Short Hills, N.J.,
said he has not decided whether to return to Kidder, which has paid
his legal fees and a reduced salary since his arrest.
   For now, Wigton said he's happy playing golf and relaxing and
doesn't miss the long hours on the trading desk. The mild-mannered
Wall Streeter said he celebrated his victory over the government at
a champagne dinner with his wife and three children Monday.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar eased against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices were little
changed.
   Currency dealers said the market was empty with most investors
staying on the sidelines in the absence of any news developments.
   Some market participants attributed the dollar's slightly weaker
stance partly to Tuesday's report of a sharper-than-expected
1.9-percent drop in U.S. durable goods orders for July, and partly
to rumors in New York that the West German central bank would raise
key interest rates Thursday.
   Although the market will be watching for developments when the
Bundesbank resumes its regular policy meetings after a summer pause,
most analysts agree such action is unlikely.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 142.35 Later, in London, it
was quoted at 142.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.9405 West German marks, down from 1.9410; 6.6755
Swiss francs, up from 1.6730; 6.5520 French francs, down from
6.5555; 2.1879 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2835; 1,393.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,403.00; 1.1750 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1742.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5875 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5840 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $366.30 a troy ounce, compared with late
Tuesday's $366.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.80.
   In Zurich, the bid was $366.75, up from $366.40 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 32 cents to close at $367.23.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.23 a troy ounce, down from
Tuesday's $5.24.

   The U.S. dollar dropped against the Japanese yen
today for the third consecutive day in Tokyo, and share prices fell
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 142.35 yen, down 0.43 yen from Tuesday's
close of 142.78 yen. After opening at 142.30 yen, the dollar ranged
between 142.20 and 142.60 yen. It now has fallen 1.17 yen in three
trading days.
   Analysts said the U.S. currency opened lower following its
downswing in New York Tuesday, but then recovered slightly.
   ``There was speculation that the West German Bundesbank would
raise interest rates and it caused the dollar to decline against the
West German mark,'' said a dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank. ``But the
speculation was said to be groundless and it caused the dollar to
bounce back marginally.''
   Another dealer at the bank said, ``It was another quiet day in
Tokyo. Most dealers find it difficult to make substantial moves
because of a lack of incentives. Institutional investors are not
placing large orders, either.''
   Dealers also said market participants were awaiting the results
of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's open market
committee in Washington, which was to end later today. Interest
rates were among topics to be discussed at the meeting.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 26.48 points
Tuesday, fell another 221.07 points, or 0.63 percent, closing at
34,893.28.
   Securities dealers said trading was light throughout the day
because of a lack of incentives.
   ``It (index) surpassed the 35,000 mark at one point during the
day, but market participants quickly took advantage and turned to
profit-taking, causing the Nikkei to fall back again,'' said a
dealer at Nikko Securities Co.

<HEAD>Shareholder Seeks to Force Directors to Auction UAL to Highest Bidder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to its public stance, UAL Corp. is
actively seeking potential bidders for the company and should be
forced to negotiate with suitor Marvin Davis and auction the company
to the highest bidder, a shareholder's lawsuit contends.
   The suit, filed Tuesday by shareholder Lionel Brazen in Cook
County Circuit Court here, asked the court to grant a temporary
injunction to compel the parent of United Airlines ``to bargain in
good faith with all interested acquirers and auction UAL to the
highest possible bidder.''
   The lawsuit _ which seeks certification as a class action _ was
filed as UAL reportedly was being courted by a number of suitors
besides Davis, whose original offer several weeks ago touched off a
record-breaking climb in UAL stock.
   Davis' bid was sweetened last Wednesday to $6.19 billion, or $275
a share.
   The complaint alleged that ``while refusing to publicly take a
position on the Davis proposal, UAL and its directors are actively
engaged in seeking out other potential bidders for UAL.''
   The suit also cited a Wall Street Journal report that UAL might
be favoring British Airways PLC as a potential acquirer, saying such
talks would constitute ``an admission by UAL and its directors that
the company is for sale.''
   UAL spokesman Rob Doughty denied a decision to sell the company
had in fact been made, repeating what UAL directors said after two
board meetings last week, ``that it was premature to say that a
decision has been reached on whether a sale of the company is
appropriate.''
   The Journal reported today that UAL was likely to wait for
financing details of Davis' financing bid before deciding what to do.
   UAL shares slipped $1.75 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange
to close at $272.
   Besides British Airways, said to be working in tandem with Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., other reported bidders for UAL are leveraged buyout
specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and a management-led group
headed by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf.
   United and representatives of those firms have declined comment,
citing policies regarding speculative reports.
   Some potential acquirers also reportedly met with union officials
representing United's pilots and machinists, who are considered
crucial to any sale or restructuring of the airline and might seek
an equity stake in return for their cooperation.
   Union officials also have declined to comment on matters related
to an acquisition of the company.
   The lawsuit, without specifying any potential suitor, asks the
court to order UAL directors to ``bargain in good faith with all
interested acquirers and to auction UAL to the highest possible
bidders.''

<TEXT>
   The world has 32 new billionaires this year,
according to a list compiled by Fortune magazine, including indicted
junk-bond chieftan Michael R. Milken and a Taiwanese tycoon with
holdings in insurance, hotels and soy sauce companies.
   Meanwhile, the same five individuals or families who topped last
year's list also lead the 1989 ranking, the magazine reports in its
Sept. 11 edition, due on newsstands today.
   The list swelled to 157 members this year with the addition of 32
members, although five others fell off the ranking. The list
includes individuals and nuclear families with net worth Fortune
estimates at $1 billion or more.
   Taiwanese investor Tsai Wan-Lin, 64, joined the list at the No. 6
spot. The former poor farmer saw his 65 percent stake in Cathay Life
Insurance in Taipei skyrocket in value and his net worth increase to
$9 billion as the Taiwan stock market took off, Fortune said.
   Milken, 43, who faces trial on federal charges that he violated
securities laws, joined the list at No. 125, with an estimated
fortune of $1.2 billion.
   The Sultan of Brunei, who presides over the small oil-rich nation
near the South China Sea, is still the world's wealthiest man with
an estimated fortune of $25 billion, the magazine stated.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and his family are next with $18
billion, followed by Forrest E. Mars Sr. and the Mars candy-bar
clan, who are estimated to be worth $12.5 billion.
   Ranked fourth after the Mars family was the world's richest
woman, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, who is worth an estimated $10.9
billion compared with $8.7 billion last year, Fortune reported.
   Fifth on the list were New York-based publishing magnates Samuel
I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald E. Newhouse, worth an estimated $10
billion.
   Wal-Mart Stores mogul Sam Moore Walton, of Bentonville, Ark., was
seventh with $8.9 billion; the Reichmann brothers _ Albert, Paul and
Ralph _ whose Ontario-based Olympia &amp; York is the largest owner of
New York City commercial real estate, are eighth with $8.4 billion;
British real estate tycoon Gerald Grosvenor is ninth with $6.9
billion; and Kenneth Roy Thomson, who controls Canada's Thomson
Newspapers Ltd., was ranked No. 10 with estimated wealth of $6.9
billion.
   Among other newcomers are Carl C. Icahn, the takeover strategist
who also is chairman and chief stockholder of Trans World Airlines
Inc. and worth an estimated $1.2 billion; Turner Broadcasting System
Chairman Ted Turner, $1.3 billion; Kirk Kerkorian, helped by the
sale this year of MGM-UA Communications Co., $1.1 billion; and
Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc., $3.2 billion.
   Of those on the list, there are 58 in the United States, 54 in
Europe, 23 in Asia, including 11 Japanese, and 22 others.

<HEAD>Tootsie Roll Company Sues Toilet Paper Packager</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Confusing Tootsie Roll candies with toilet paper
may be a longshot, but the candy company doesn't want to take a
chance.
   So it filed suit Tuesday against Cloud Nine Promotions Inc. of
Alpharetta, Ga., which packages toilet paper in a brown wrapper with
red-orange stripes and calls it Tushie Rolls.
   The lawsuit asks the maker of the gag gift, to turn all of its
profits over to Tootsie Roll Industries, abandon the trademark
application it submitted in 1987 and not make any more rolls.
   ``It is not plaintiff's policy to permit use of its trademarks
for scandalous, immoral, obscene, scatological, unwholesome or
distasteful purposes,'' the lawsuit says of Tootsie Roll's
93-year-old trademark.
   Officials with Cloud Nine could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.
   But an assistant manager of Spencer Gifts in Cumberland Mall, who
requested anonymity, said the Tushies fooled her.
   ``I thought the Tootsie Roll people put it out,'' she said of the
$6.99-a-roll gift. But she said the store has sold only two of the
rolls.

<HEAD>British Trade Figures Worse Than Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened to 2.46
billion pounds in July from a revised shortfall of 1.92 billion
pounds in June, the government announced Wednesday.
   The Central Statistical Office said the worse-than-expected,
seasonally-adjusted figures could have been distorted by a
three-week strike by dock workers at some British ports which ended
earlier this month.
   The pound started to fall in hectic trading on the news from
$1.5875 before the figures were released at to $1.5890, but the Bank
of England quickly intervened.
   The government said the current account deficit for July was 2.06
billion pounds, the equivalent of $3.25 billion, compared with a
month-earlier deficit of 1.52 billion pounds.
   The current account deficit includes invisible trade, such as
services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer
payments. Such trade was estimated to be in surplus by 400 million
pounds.
   Forecasts had called for a merchandise trade gap of 1.7 billion
to 1.8 billion pounds and a current account deficit of 1.3 billion
to 1.4 billion pounds.
   The government said exports totalled 7.73 billion pounds in July,
down from 7.87 billion pounds in June.
   Imports totaled a record 10.19 billion pounds in July, up from
9.79 billion pounds in June.
   Since the beginning of 1989, Britain's merchandise trade balance
has been in deficit by 14.27 billion pounds, compared with a deficit
of 11.22 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The current account has been in deficit by 11.54 billion pounds
so far this year, compared with a deficit of 7.65 billion pounds a
year earlier.

<HEAD>Ringo Starr, Daughter, in New Oldsmobile Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Who else would be in an Oldsmobile but Ringo Starr
and his daughter Lee?
   Oldsmobile, the General Motors Corp. division known mostly for
drivers with graying hair and car trunks big enough for a couple of
sets of golf clubs, kicks off a second-year series of advertisements
Friday night with the theme of ``This is not your father's
Oldsmobile.''
   In one ad, to debut on NBC's ``NFL Preseason Football,'' the
ex-Beatle _ complete with pony tail and an earring _ is chased by a
crowd of middle-aged women, slides down a banquet table and out of a
12th-floor window. His fall is broken by an awning and he winds up
in the passenger seat of a new four-door Olds Cutlass Supreme.
   At the wheel is his 18-year-old daughter, sporting purple hair.
   ``Would you ever have imagined that Oldsmobile would use someone
with a ponytail and an earring and a daughter with purple hair to
sell their cars?'' said Rick Ross, the division's director of
advertising.
   Others in the ``father'' campaign for 1990 will be actor Peter
Graves and his daughter, Amanda; Ted Einstein, great-grandson of
Albert Einstein; and the adult children of entertainer Harry
Belafonte, without their father.
   The campaign begun last year caught the eye of the advertising
world, but may not be attracting buyers to dealer showrooms. Through
Aug. 10 of this year, Oldsmobile sales were running 15.4 percent
behind last year's pace, while GM car sales were down 9 percent.
   ``It takes two or three years, sometimes longer, for a campaign
to end up in a direct-sales boost,'' Ross said. ``I think we're
going to see some sales results in 1990. Our dealers are reporting
they're getting a lot younger traffic.''
   According to Olds, its average buyer is 51 years old, and
executives would like that age to drop into the upper 40s.
   In an effort to broaden the Oldsmobile appeal, the company will
introduce a minivan, the Silhouette, and will get some production of
a new sport-utility vehicle next year, GM officials have said.
   Advertising budget figures are closely held by automakers, but
there have been estimates that GM has spent $120 million advertising
its Oldsmobiles for the 1989 model year, much of that cost in
starting up the new theme.
   Ross said the division is increasing its advertising spending
this year, but not by as much as it did in 1989 to get the
``father'' campaign off the ground.

<HEAD>Simmons Considering Buyout Of Georgia Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NL Industries Inc., a company controlled by Texas
financier Harold Simmons, said it was prepared to offer around $1.3
billion for Georgia Gulf Corp., a commerical concern in which it
recently accumulated a 9.9 percent stake.
   The propsal, made in a letter to Georgia Gulf Chairman James R.
Kuse, sent Georgia Gulf stock surging $7.25 a share to close at
$58.75 Tuesday in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. NL
shares rose 12.5 cents to finish at $24.625.
   The closing Georgia Gulf price exceeded the $55 a share Simmons
said he was prepared to pay for the company. Two months ago Georgia
Gulf shares traded at around $35.
   ``Such a transaction might take the form of a leveraged
recapitalization, merger or other transaction,'' said the Kuse
letter, which was signed by NL President J. Landis Martin. ``We
believe that the value of Georgia Gulf's common shares would be
enhanced by a transaction in which shareholders receive $55 per
share in cash.''
   Georgia Pacific released the letter without comment on Tuesday, a
day after it was sent.
   The letter follows a recent filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in which Simmons indicated a takeover attempt of
Georgia Gulf was possible. He said his interest in the company was
``no longer held solely for the purpose of investment.''
   Simmons and his companies owns 2.3 million shares, or 9.9 percent
of Georgia Gulf's approximately 24 million shares outstanding, a
stake that was accumulated in recent months.
   John Garcia, a securities analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in
New York, said that Georgia Gulf might try to establish an employee
stock ownership plan to fend off a hostile takeover attempt.
   Georgia Gulf, created in 1985 as a spinoff of Georgia-Pacific
Corp., had 1988 sales of $1.06 billion.
   Simmons has built a fortune estimated at more than $1.6 billion
through acquisitions. His holding company, Dallas-based Valhi Inc.,
had 1988 sales of $2.25 billion.
   Simmons acquired control of NL Industries, a chemical and
petroleum service company, last year in a $1 billion deal.

<HEAD>J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. Prepares to Take Reins at Prime Computer Inc.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restoring customers' confidence in Prime Computer
Inc. will be the first order of business when the company, hobbled
by an expensive antitakeover campaign, completes its friendly merger
with J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.
   Whitney partner Russell E. Planitzer said Tuesday the deal should
be completed within 10 days.
   A new president, James F. McDonald, will immediately take the
reins and a new board will be named, Planitzer said.
   Prime, a Natick-based minicomputer maker, had been searching for
an ally against a $1.13 billion hostile bid from MAI Basic Four Inc.
of Tustin, Calif., when Whitney, the nation's oldest venture capital
firm, came forward in June.
   The companies agreed to a friendly merger under which Prime will
effectively become a private company.
   Whitney offered to pay $20 a share for 49.5 million shares and
exchange notes with a face value of $22 per share for the remaining
21 percent of Prime's shares.
   Securities analysts said those notes would trade at a substantial
discount and estimated the total value of the deal at between $17
and $18.50 a share, or $1.06 billion to $1.16 billion.
   McDonald, the next president, has most recently been president of
Gould Inc., which he guided to a turnaround and subsequent sale to
Nippon Mining Co. in 1988. He succeeds Anthony L. Craig, who has
held the post since November and has chosen to resign after the
Whitney group completes its tender offer for Prime.
   Repaying debt will be pivotal for Prime in the coming months,
said John W. Adams, an analyst who follows Prime for the Boston
investment firm Adams Harkness &amp; Hill.
   ``The real issue is whether all that debt on the balance sheet is
going to make a difference to customers,'' he said. ``Prime had a
very strong balance sheet going into this and goes out with a very
leveraged balance sheet.''
   McDonald said the company's two immediate priorities would be
employees and customers. He said both groups had been severely
shaken by the long struggle against MAI Basic.
   ``If I were a customer in the last 10 months, (the company's
situation) would have bothered me to death,'' he said. ``I think the
change is a very welcome one.''
   McDonald said the computer company would remain in Natick, but
that a new business strategy would include an undetermined number of
layoffs and substantial changes in the company's senior management.
   Prime, which makes minicomputers and computer-aided design and
manufacturing systems, turned a profit of $19 million on sales of
$1.6 billion in 1988.
   But the cost of defending against a takeover and slow sales of
minicomputers led to losses of $14.4 million in the final quarter of
1988, $5 million in the first quarter of this year and $19 million
in the second quarter.

<HEAD>Company May Cut Parts Of Work Force by 25 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. reportedly has told at
least nine of its departments to cut their workforces by 25 percent
through attrition or transfer by July 1991.
   Digital, which is based in Maynard, has about 125,800 employees,
but only an estimated 30,000 apparently would be involved, putting
the total reduction in employees at around 7,500, The Boston Globe
reported today.
   The computer manufacturer confirmed the existence of an internal
memo about the workforce reduction and said any of the cuts would be
made through attrition and transfer of workers whose jobs are
eliminated to other divisions.
   ``We have no plans at all for layoffs,'' said Nikki Richardson, a
spokeswoman for Digital.
   The announcement comes less than a week after Unisys Corp.,
another big computer maker, said it plans to reduce its worldwide
workforce by 7 percent to 8 percent by the end of 1990, a cut of
6,000 to 7,000 jobs would include some layoffs.
   Jobs affected by cutbacks are considered support jobs _ including
those in administration, law, finance, personnel, purchasing data
information services, facilities, materials and quality, the Globe
said.
   Ms. Richardson said she did not know how many employees performed
such job, but analysts told the Globe it could be as many as 30,000.
   Because the company's headquarters is in Maynard, much of any
reduction could affect Massachusetts employees. Digital has 33,700
of its employees in the state.
   The memo, the Globe said, orders heads of affected departments to
plan for cutting budgets for the fiscal year that began July 1 by 10
percent.
   ``It is assumed that this will include a sizable reduction in
population,'' the memo said.
   It also said that to reduce the number of employees in those
departments by 25 percent by July 1991 ``each group will have to
struggle with what work to discontinue.
   ``They should not just shave expenses, but rather eliminate
entire efforts,'' it said.
   ``It's not a plan, it's a working document.... a directional
document to promote ideas within the company,'' Ms. Richardson said
of the memo.
   Digital previously said it will freeze the salaries of all its
employees in the United States and move as many as 4,000 employees
from manufacturing to sales and service because of a slowdown in
demand for its computers.
   It announced last month that profits for the quarter ended June
30 were down 22 percent to $313.2 million on sales of $3.495 billion.

<HEAD>Fokker Reportedly To Expand F-100 Plant In Netherlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dutch aerospace firm Fokker has
decided to expand a Dutch assembly line for its successful F-100
passenger jet, but is still negotiating over a new plant in the
United States, a Dutch newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Fokker denied that any decision had been made on the expansion of
its current F-100 assembly line at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, and
said the issue was still wide open.
   However, the Amsterdam newspaper De Volkskrant said the company
had opted to invest $381 million to expand the Schiphol plant, which
can build up to 46 F-100 jets a year.
   Other contenders for the new assembly line, which would be set up
to produce 200 F-100s from 1991 to 1997, are the Lockheed Aircraft
Corp., Grumman Corp. and Rockwell.
   According to the Volkskrant report, Fokker is still negotiating
with Lockheed's Marietta, Georgia, plant but the talks are
stagnating over the price demanded by Lockheed for assembling the
twin-engine, short-haul jets. The report gave no specifics.
   ``Banking circles in Britain openly discuss the impending
expansion at Schiphol,'' said the newspaper report, adding that
several unidentified British banks had financed the new assembly
line.
   However, Fokker spokesman Bart van Veen denied that any British
financiers were involved and characterized the Volkskrant story as
``incorrect.
   ``Nothing's been decided yet. The decisions will all be taken in
the course of or even late next month,'' Van Veen said.
   According to De Volkskrant, Fokker would announce the move to
expand at Schiphol officially on Friday, along with its semi-annual
profit figures.
   So far, Fokker has sold 193 F-100s to customers including
Swissair, USAir, American Airlines and Braniff Airlines. Fokker
customers have taken out options for another 199 of the
fuel-efficient jets.
   However, the company's Schiphol plant, which employs 7,000
people, is too small to meet the demand for F-100s.
   Van Veen said negotiations were still under way ``not only with
Lockheed but also with other'' plane builders in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. has named the former
head of General Electric's consumer electronics business to the post
of president and chief operating officer, company officials
announced today.
   Richard W. Miller, 48, who has held several top operating and
chief executive officer positions and has led successful company
turnarounds, replaces Henry H.S. Chou.
   Chou served as acting president and chief operating officer since
the resignation of Frederick A. Wang, son of company founder and
Chairman An Wang, on Aug. 8.
   ``I have great confidence in the ability of Rick Miller to assume
total control of the operations of Wang Laboratories,'' said An
Wang, who also is the company's chief executive officer. ``He will
have my full support and that of the board of directors in resolving
the company's current situation and restoring it to profitability.''
   In an interview today in New York, Miller said he wants Wang
staffers to ``know where we're going, restore their dignity and give
them pride in the company's turnaround and accomplishments.''
   Miller also said it is ``quite likely'' the company will get an
infusion of new money by issuing more stock or debt or a
combination. He said there were no plans to sell Wang.

   The stock market showed a moderate gain today as
interest rates declined.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.91 to 2,659.90 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 765 up, 457 down and
590 unchanged.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds rose
nearly $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to
the 8.21 percent-8.27 percent range.
   Analysts said that took a little pressure off the stock market,
which has been weighed down lately by concerns that rates were being
pushed higher by a stronger-than-expected economy.
   Still, many Wall Streeters remain doubtful that the Federal
Reserve will take any further steps any time soon to relax its
credit policy.
   In the view of most observers, recent evidence suggests that the
Fed might be shifting its focus back to restraining inflation in the
absence of any signs of an imminent recession.

   Jerrold Pass keeps a tighter leash on inventories of
rhinestone-studded dog collars now that his Midwest pet store chain
operates under the heavy burden of a debt-financed takeover.
   Rather than go hog-wild when building a new store, Pass
scrutinizes the cost of everything from cages to cash registers.
   The enormous interest payments that go with leveraged buyouts,
takeover deals that rely on borrowed money, have hurt a number of
highly visible companies, from drug chains to truckers to furniture
outlets.
   But as Pass Pets Ltd.'s experience shows, a lower-profile crop of
post-buyout firms is flourishing, partly because the high debt
levels force management to cut unnecessary spending.
   Pass says the relentless pressure of a multimillion-dollar debt
on the 35-store chain, headquartered near St. Louis, has made him a
better manager. He wouldn't disclose the exact amount of money owed,
but said ``I've got to make those interest payments.''
   Moreover, Pass said he's unafraid of a recession, unlike many
managers of heavily indebted companies who worry that a downturn
could shrink their income, delay debt repayments and bring angry
creditors knocking.
   ``The pet business can jump 25 percent in a recession,'' he said.
``People don't send their kids to camp _ they stay home with their
pets.''
   A small percentage of the nation's LBO debt has been repaid
delinquently or not at all, and some finance experts forecast that
LBO failures may rise sharply.
   Federal Reserve Board vice chairman Manuel Johnson, for example,
said in a June speech that about 40 percent of all debt-financed
deals are in cyclical industries that could face severe problems if
the economy shrinks.
   The troubles that LBO companies face when they can't repay
creditors first began receiving heightened attention more than a
year ago. Revco D.S. Inc., one of the largest drug store chains,
sought bankruptcy protection at that time because of inability to
pay the debt incurred in its $1.3 billion LBO.
   Other high-profile LBOs such as the $1.1 billion buyout of Singer
Co., $2.5 billion buyout of Storer Communications Inc. and $3.7
billion of Owens-Illinois Inc. also have faced difficulty managing
their heavy debt loads.
   But some experts argue that many LBO companies can pay debts
promptly and make money. Steven Kaplan, assistant professor at the
University of Chicago, said the ``companies that can't make debt
payments get a lot of press.''
   Kaplan said that in his study of more than 50 LBOs completed
between 1975 and 1985, the companies experienced an average jump in
operating income of 10 percent and a 2.6 percent increase in
profitability, both exceeding the averages by non-LBO competitors.
   An LBO has become one of the most popular corporate takeover
tools of the decade. Figures compiled by IDD Information Services
M&amp;A Database, a securities industry research concern, show the value
of LBOs completed in 1989 already totals $49.48 billion, vs. about
$16 billion for LBOs completed in 1984.
   In such a transaction, a group of investors that often includes
company management buys a company largely with borrowed money, using
its assets as collateral for the loans.
   The investors repay the loans with the company's earnings or the
sale of what they consider unnecessary assets or operations, ranging
from corporate jets to inefficent factories or entire subsidiaries.
   The results often are drastically shrunken but highly profitable,
privately owned companies that don't have to worry about the demands
of public shareholders and can concentrate instead on their
long-term businesses.
   Such companies can be resold later for an enormous profit because
the LBO investors put up little of their own money. Most of the risk
is borne by creditors who finance the LBOs.
   Experts say LBO success depends upon a company having reliable
streams of incoming cash, steady demand for its products and assets
that maintain value regardless of economic swings. That's why some
LBOs don't make it.
   One example is Cuisinarts Inc., which earlier this month sought
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because of stagnant demand for its
upscale food processors and a failure to exploit its famous name on
other products. Debt stemming from the company's 1988 LBO was just
one problem.
   Other companies likely to encounter difficulties are those that
undertook management-led LBOs mainly to escape a hostile takeover.
   Among the casualties is trailer maker Fruehauf Corp., forced to
sell most of its businesses to help pay for a $1.5 billion LBO that
thwarted an unwanted bid by takeover investor Asher Edelman. Little
is left of the original Fruehauf, now known as K-H Corp.
   Problems also arise when deals are ``priced on the bet that the
best case is going to materialize _ it's never happened,'' said Al
Rappaport, chairman of Chicago-based consulting firm Alcar Group Inc.
   LBO specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., generally
considered the pioneer of the strategy and engineer of the record
$25 billion LBO of RJR Nabisco Inc. earlier this year, reportedly
faces difficulties unloading some businesses acquired in several of
it debt-financed takeovers.
   In addition, some companies Kohlberg helped acquire via LBOs are
foundering. New York-based Seaman's Furniture Co., for example, has
said it must renegotiate debt payments, partly because sales have
stagnated. The $360 million LBO engineered two years ago presumed
healthy sales growth.
   Despite the difficulties faced by some of high-profile LBOs, many
others are considered mundane transactions that do not hinge on the
mass sale of assets or other drastic restructuring.
   Rappaport said more than 80 percent of LBOs undertaken between
1986 and 1988 were divestitures, meaning that management bought
divisions from the parent company that could be run more efficiently
as separate businesses. Such deals have been widely successful.
   Take O.M. Scott &amp; Sons Co., an Ohio fertilizer maker that
conglomerate ITT Corp. sold to a management-led group in a 1986 LBO.
In the past two years, sales have risen by 35 percent, operating
profit has jumped 50 percent, and the company has repaid 20 percent
of its debt load.
   The case of Pass Pets also is relatively common: an entrepreneur
wants to sell the company he founded but still retain a stake in the
business.
   After grooming his pet chain for 20 years, Pass sold a majority
stake to Horizon Investments, an LBO investment firm, and kept his
position as president and minority owner. Horizon purchased its
stake with borrowed money.
   Such an arrangement, Pass said, allowed him to ``have my company
and get my money out. I got a job, my company and cash.''
   Still, as manager he is responsible for repaying the LBO debt.
Getting used to that was difficult for Pass, who called it ``a new
way of doing business.''
   August Ceradini saw an LBO as a way of buying a company with
other people's money. His yacht charter business has a
debt-to-equity ratio of 5-to-1 but he's having no problem paying the
interest.
   ``We have a good growth rate and good control of costs,'' said
Ceradini, president of New York Cruise Lines Inc. The company was
created when a Manhattan sightseeing ship company completed an LBO
of World Yacht Inc., which runs dinner-dance cruises around New York
harbor.
   Despite the pressure of interest payments, Ceradini is unafraid
of recession. ``Every restaurant in New York is down 20 percent, and
we're ahead of last year. Good food and good service doesn't wear
out, and neither does a spectacular view of the city.''

   Federal prosecutors are considering whether to
reverse course and allow Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to pay Michael
R. Milken more than $100 million for work he did last year, sources
said Wednesday.
   The provision barring Drexel from paying its indicted former junk
bond trader his 1988 compensation was included in the investment
firm's formal settlement of criminal securities fraud charges with
the government.
   The withholding has been controversial because Milken has not
been charged with any wrongdoing in 1988. Milken has challenged the
provision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Sources familiar with the case, who asked not to be named, said
prosecutors have not made a final decision on whether to pay Milken
his compensation, estimated at more than $100 million.
   But they indicated that a reversal may be made because legal
experts have criticized the provision as potentially
unconstitutional and that the government may not want to start its
case against Milken off on the wrong foot.
   They said that ending the lengthy delay in Drexel's plea in the
case was not a factor in reconsidering the payment provision.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder, Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Carroll and a Milken spokesman all declined to comment.
   The government has not said officially why it sought to keep the
money from Milken. But prosecutors have indicated they believed it
was improper for Drexel to settle criminal charges at the same time
it was paying millions of dollars to the employee it contended was
responsible for the illegal activity.
   Drexel agreed in December to pay $650 million and plead guilty to
six felony charges of securities law violations. But the plea has
been held up by a series of legal issues related to Milken, who had
headed the investment house's junk bond operation.
   The last of these issues was Milken's challenge to the
prosecutors' agreement with Drexel on his pay.
   Milken was charged in March in a 98-count indictment with
racketeering, conspiracy, mail fraud and other illegal activities
related to securities transactions. He pleaded not guilty and is
scheduled to go to trial in March.
   A U.S. District Court hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 6 on
Milken's arguments that the pay provision deprived him of due
process.
   Milken has resigned from Drexel and set up his own financial
consulting firm.

<HEAD>NYMEX To Launch Trading On Residual Fuel Oil Contract On Oct. 2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Mercantile Exchange said Wednesday
it plans to begin trading in a new residual fuel oil futures
contract on Oct. 2.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
futures markets, on Tuesday unanimously approved the exchange's
request to trade futures contracts in residual fuel oil.
   Residual fuel oil is a heavy fuel oil produced from the residue
left over after crude oil is refined.
   The grade to be traded is 1 percent sulfur, and is used mainly
for generating electricity. Residual fuel oil with a high sulfur
content is used to fuel waterborne vessels such as tankers and
barges.
   Approximately 1.3 million barrels of residuel fuel are consumed
daily in the United States.
   December will be the first delivery month, with trading conducted
in 15 consecutive months, the exchange said. The last trading day on
the contract will be the last business day of the month before the
delivery month.
   Delivery will occur in the Houston Ship Channel west of
Lynchburg, Texas.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods,
like fuel oil or soybeans, at a specified price at a specified time
in the future. Most futures traders never take or make delivery.
They usually close out their positions before the delivery date.
   The new futures contract calls for delivery of 1,000 barrels of
residual fuel oil.
   Futures prices would be quoted in dollars and cents per barrel,
with a minimum price fluctuation of one cent and a proposed daily
maximum fluctuation of $1 per barrel _ $1,000 per contract _ with a
provision for expanding the limit to $2 per barrel.
   The mercantile exchange first sought CFTC approval for residual
fuel oil futures in March. The exchange, based in the World Trade
Center in lower Manhattan, already lists futures contracts in crude
oil, gasoline, heating oil, gold, platinum and other commodities.

   The U.S. dollar rose Wednesday against most major
foreign currencies in European trading. Gold prices declined.
   The dollar strengthened as rumors of a possible West German
interest rate hike faded and dealers decided that the dollar selling
on Tuesday was overdone.
   News of a wider-than-expected British trade deficit also helped
push the dollar higher against the pound.
   Britain's July merchandise trade gap rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3.87 billion from $3.01 billion the previous month, while
the current account deficit increased to $3.24 billion from $2.38
billion.
   Sterling had gained against the dollar in early trading but ended
the day at $1.5700, down from $1.5840 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 142.35 yen. It rose in London
to 143.10 yen.
   Other late dollar rates compared with Tuesday: 1.9555 West German
marks, up from 1.9410; 1.6870 Swiss francs, up from 1.6730; 6.5965
French francs, up from 6.5555; 2.2000 Dutch guilders, down from
2.2035; 1.1727 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1742; and 1,399.50
Italian lire, down from 1,403.00.
   Gold traded at $364.25 a troy ounce in London, down from $366.75
Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $363.85 an ounce, down from
$366.40.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 32 cents to close at $367.23 an
ounce.
   Silver fell in London to $5.19 a troy ounce from Tuesday's $5.24.

<TEXT>
   Dry beer is becoming a big hit across the United
States, although most drinkers still have no idea what it is or what
it tastes like.
   That may be one reason the distinct new beer has become so
popular.
   ``The curiosity level is unbelievable,'' said Bob Goughenour, a
group brand executive at Anheuser-Busch Inc. who helped bring dry
beer to American supermarkets and taverns.
   So, be prepared.
   The cacophonous vendors at the stadium may soon begin asking,
``How's about a nice dry one.'' Your neighbor may invite you over
for something dry to drink.
   It's been a year since Anheuser-Busch introduced Michelob Dry in
this country, and the brand has been so successful _ at one point,
the brewer couldn't make it fast enough to keep up with sales _ the
company earlier this year introduced a dry version of Budweiser, the
world's best-selling beer.
   Bud Dry should be available nationally by the end of the year,
said Goughenour.
   ``We're just delighted with dry beer. Our volumes are more than
twice what we expected. It's just been incredible,'' he said.
   Dry beer is brewed to produce a less-sweet taste that doesn't
linger. It's made with a process that converts more of the malt and
rice into fermentable sugars which interact more efficiently with
the yeast.
   The beer contains less sugar than regular beer, fewer calories
and no aftertaste, which probably is its most noticeable difference.
   Bud Dry's advertising slogan is ``Comes on Strong, Then It's
Gone.''
   Last year, about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of dry beer were sold
in the United States, said Frank Walters, director of research for
IMPACT magazine, a New York-based trade publication for the
alcoholic beverage industry.
   This year, Walters expects sales of about 2.5 million barrels.
Next year he said the amount should climb to 6 million barrels.
Annual sales of beer in the United States total about 188 million
barrels.
   ``It's still very early to say, but we expect by the end of this
century dry beer should be at about 20 million barrels,'' Walters
said. ``But this category is so new that that could all change in
the next hour.''
   One big question remains about dry beer: Is it just a fad?
   ``It's honestly too early to tell,'' said Robert Weinberg, an
industry consultant and professor of marketing management at
Washington University in St. Louis. ``I think it may be more than a
fad because it looks like this is a very pleasing product to young
women.''
   Weinberg said several female students have told him they like
Michelob Dry because it's the only beer that doesn't make them feel
like they smell ``like a brewery.''
   The female market has been something brewers have hungrily eyed
for decades, Weinberg said, and if dry beer opens the door to that
market, it will prove much more than a fad.
   Odds that a beer drinker will be male are about two-to-one,
Weinberg said.
   At the country's second largest brewery, Miller Brewing Co.,
officials are carefully watching the growth of dry beer, but remain
unconvinced that the category will be around for a long time.
   ``Our research shows that these products do not offer any
significant benefit or appeal to mainstream beer drinkers,'' said
Miller spokeswoman Susan Henderson.
   She said Miller, based in Milwaukee, has no plans to plunge into
the dry beer fray.
   Nineteen imported and domestic dry beers are currently sold
around the country including Canadian, Japanese and European brands.
   G. Heileman Brewing Co., of Lacrosse, Wis., sells five different
dry beers on a regional basis including Rainier Special Dry in the
Northwest and I.C. Special Dry in Pennsylvania.
   Earlier this month, the company, which is a collection of
regional breweries, introduced Lone Star Dry in Texas, said
spokesman Bill Eiler.
   ``We see a real strong future in dry beer. We think it's here to
stay,'' Eiler said.
   Although it's just started to catch the public's fancy, dry beer
is not new.
   Regional beers in the 1950s and '60s, such as Rheingold and Stag
Pale Dry, were touted for dry taste, but they never caused a big a
stir in the industry like the current craze, which got started about
two years ago in Japan.
   Asahi Breweries Ltd. of Toyko introduced a dry brand that started
the sensation and prompted all of Japan's major brewers to scramble
to concoct their own dry brands.
   Now, the category has captured 20 percent to 30 percent of the
Japanese beer market, industry analysts say.
   Goughenour was sent to Japan by Anheuser-Busch to investigate the
skyrocketing dry beer sales and see if the company should get into
the category.
   He came back perplexed.
   ``I couldn't figure out how this could be applied in this
country. That was the question mark,'' he said. ``When we first
started, nobody knew what we were talking about. Americans know dry
wine. They know dry martinis and dry cleaning, but they really don't
know what dry is.''
   In Japan, consumers know what dry is because dry sake is a staple
beverage, so dry beer is kind of a logical extension for them,
Goughenour said.
   But in the United States, the concept of ``dry'' is elusive.
   That's why Goughenour spent a lot of time asking U.S. beer
drinkers to define the meaning of ``dry'' as they thought it might
apply to beer.
   ``We got consumers to tell us what dry is and then we made
something with a brand new, refreshing, smooth taste,'' he said.
``They told us what to make.''

   Share prices shrugged off disappointing British
trade data Wednesday and rallied strongly on the London Stock
Exchange.
   Traders attributed the advance to renewed speculative buying and
steady early trading on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended up 11.6
points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,382.4.
   Volume totaled 439 million shares, up from 391.6 million traded
on Tuesday.
   ``The market just wants to go up,'' one trader said. ``There is a
feeling that the trade figures are so bad they can't get any worse.''
   A British government trade report showed a current-account
deficit of 2.062 billion pounds, or around $3.237 billion, in July,
surpassing market expectations which averaged around 1.35 billion
pounds, or $2.119 billion.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 500-stock index closed at
1,334.73, up 4.09. The narrower Financial Times 30-share index
closed up 9.6 points at 1,975.9.
   At the London close, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was
up 10.24 points at 2,661.23.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting overnight
rainfall in Midwestern growing areas and forecasts for more
precipitation in the region.
   Rainfall amounts ranging from sprinkles to more than an inch were
reported Tuesday in the eastern Corn Belt states of Indiana, Ohio
and Michigan. Overnight showers brought badly needed moisture to
Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.
   But the losses were limited by rising worries about the potential
for damage to crops that were planted later than usual due to wet
conditions in the spring.
   ``Some articles are starting to surface from meteorologists
concerning the potential for an early freeze,'' said Ted Mao, a
grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Perceptions also are growing that crop yields may not be as great
as many experts had earlier thought.

<HEAD>Former Trader Lisa Jones Sentenced to 18 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. assistant
trader Lisa Jones was sentenced Wednesday to 18 months in prison and
ordered to pay more than $50,000 for lying to a grand jury
investigating Wall Street crime.
   Jones, 26, was the first person convicted in the nearly
three-year-old federal probe and her case had indirect links to the
prosecution of former Drexel financier Michael Milken, who is
accused of racketeering and fraud.
   A federal jury in March found Jones guilty on five counts of
perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to a
federal grand jury in January 1988 in an investigation of trading
involving Drexel.
   Jones plans to appeal the verdict.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand dismissed arguments by Jones'
lawyer that a prison term would cause greater psychological harm for
the one-time teen-age runaway, saying mental treatment would a part
of her sentence.
   The judge said Jones was aware she was breaking the law and said
her crimes ``pose a grave danger to law enforcement.''
   ``There was a very conscious and deliberate decision which she
made to lie,'' Sand said. ``No one contends she did not know she was
lying.''
   Jones, who left home at age 14, climbed to a $100,000-a-year job
as an assistant bond trader in Drexel's high-yield junk bond
department in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   In three appearances before the federal grand jury, Jones said
she did not recall any discussions about stock ``parking'' in
contacts with Princeton-Newport Partners LP, a defunct investment
firm whose principals were convicted of securities fraud last month.
   Jones worked for former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg, who was
convicted in the Princeton-Newport case and faces other charges. At
Jones' trial, prosecutors showed that transactions she handled
constituted parking, which involves concealing the true ownership of
stock.
   Newberg reported directly to Milken, who has been indicted on 98
counts of racketeering and securities fraud. Some of the charges in
the Princeton-Newport case overlap counts in Milken's indictment.
   Jones' attorney, Daniel H. Bookin, argued that Jones had
``substantially reduced mental capacity'' when she was questioned
during the Drexel investigation and that a jail term would be
harmful to her. He cited a psychiatrist's report to bolster his
defense.
   Bookin said Jones had suffered a difficult life and Drexel became
``the family she never had'' when ``she was thrust into the largest
and most bitterly contested white-collar criminal investigation in
history.''
   But the government urged a sentence above the possible minimum 10
to 16 months, on grounds that Jones' perjury severely impeded the
government's Drexel investigation.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hansen said said Jones was offered
numerous chances to alter her grand jury testimony and cooperate
with prosecutors but did not.
   The government said in court papers that Jones also gave about
``150 demonstrably false answers'' about professional and personal
matters on the witness stand during her trial.
   Sand said, ``Whether Bruce Newberg or others at Drexel were
family or quasi-family or occupied some other sheltering or
nurturing role in Miss Jones' life, it does not overcome the fact
that there was a very conscious and deliberate decision which she
made to lie ... and to persist in a pattern of lying.''
   New federal sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence of 18 to
24 months imprisonment for the severity of the perjury the
prosecution indicated Jones had committed. Federal law provided a
maximum possible penalty of up to 35 years and a $1.75 million fine
for the seven felony counts.
   Sand ordered her to serve 18 months in a minimum security women's
prison in Phoenix, Ariz., where he said she would have access to
mental health therapy.
   Sand also ordered 2{ years of supervised work release with
continued mental health treatment. Jones was fined $25,000 plus the
cost of her incarceration and supervised release, for a total of
$51,531.50.
   The judge said he would rule Sept. 13 whether to allow Jones to
remain free on bond pending an appeal.

   Car and light truck sales by the nation's Big
Three automakers were flat in mid-August as buyer incentives and the
urge to beat 1990 price increases barely overcame summer sales
doldrums, the companies said Wednesday.
   While Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported slight increases
in car sales, General Motors Corp.'s auto sales sagged a fraction of
a percent.
   Overall, the Big Three reported selling cars and light trucks at
an average daily rate of 31,200 during the Aug. 11-20 period this
year, 0.08 percent higher than the daily rate of 31,173 during the
same period last year.
   Car sales were up 1.5 percent. Truck sales, which had been strong
despite a weakening car market, sagged 2.3 percent.
   Automakers with higher-than-anticipated new car inventories have
been offering buyers hundreds, even thousands of dollars in some
cases, to take 1989 models off dealer lots.
   Further driving home the ``buy now'' theme have been
announcements of tentative 1990 car prices, with increases on new
models expected to average 3.4 percent at GM, 4.8 percent at Ford
and 5 percent at Chrysler.
   For the year to date, the Big Three automakers said cars and
light trucks sold at a rate of 35,054 a day, down 5 percent from a
daily rate of 36,915 in the same period in 1988. Car sales were down
6.9 percent for the year to date while light truck sales lagged by
1.8 percent.
   GM said it sold cars at a daily rate of 9,752 in the mid-August
period, down 0.7 percent from the same period last year. For the
year to date, GM sales were down 8.3 percent to a daily rate of
11,245.
   GM said its light truck sales were up 4.3 percent for mid-August
and up 1.9 percent for the year to date.
   Ford reported selling cars at a rate of 6,878 a day during the
period, up 2.9 percent from the same period last year. For the year
to date, Ford car sales were down 1.4 percent.
   Ford light truck sales were down 10.7 percent in the mid-August
period and down 3 percent for the year to date, the company said.
   Chrysler said its cars sold at 3,061 a day in the mid-August
period, up 6 percent from the year-earlier period, and 3,118 a day
for the year to date, up 13.4 percent.
   Light truck sales sagged 1.2 percent for the period and 0.2
percent for the year to date at Chrysler, the company said.

   CBS won U.S. television rights to the 1994 Winter
Olympics at Lillehammer, Norway, with a bid of $300 million, The
Associated Press learned Wednesday.
   CBS last year won rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics at
Albertville, France, for $243 million. NBC won the rights to the
1992 Summer Olympics at Barcelona, Spain, for $401 million.
   The top price for a Winter Olympics was the $309 million ABC paid
for the 1988 Games at Calgary, Alberta.
   The bidding for rights to the Lillehammer Games had been
scheduled for Sept. 7. A network source familiar with the
negotiations said ABC had told the Olympic organizers that it did
not intend to bid.
   The source said that the organizers told NBC that CBS had
previously guaranteed a minimum bid of $290 million. CBS Sports
President Neal Pilson traveled to Toronto on Tuesday to finalize the
deal with International Olympic Committee vice president Richard
Pound after NBC apparently said it would not match CBS' minimum bid.
   CBS scheduled a news conference for late Wednesday in New York to
make the announcement. There was no immediate reaction from NBC or
ABC.

   Federal prosecutors are considering reversing
course and allowing Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to pay indicted
financier Michael R. Milken more than $100 million for work he did
last year, sources said Wednesday.
   The provision barring Drexel from paying its former junk bond
trader his 1988 compensation was included in the investment firm's
formal settlement of criminal securities fraud charges brought by
the government.
   The withholding of pay has been controversial because Milken has
not been charged with committing any wrongdoing during 1988. Milken
has challenged the provision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Sources familiar with the case, who asked not to be named, said
prosecutors have not made a final decision on whether to let Drexel
pay Milken his compensation, which court documents place at well
over $100 million.
   But they indicated a reversal may be made because legal experts
have criticized the provision as potentially unconstitutional and
the government may not want to start its case against Milken before
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood off on the wrong foot.
   They said ending the lengthy delay of Drexel's plea in the case
was not a factor in reconsidering the payment provision.
   Spokesmen for Drexel and Milken declined to comment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said: ``When and if we make
a decision with regard to any matters in these cases, we will tell
them to Judge Wood before we tell them to anyone else.''
   The government has indicated the money was ordered withheld on
grounds it was improper for Drexel to settle criminal charges while
it was paying millions to the employee allegedly responsible for
illegal activity.
   Drexel agreed in December to pay $650 million and plead guilty to
six felonies for violating securities laws, charges that stemmed
from the Ivan Boesky insider trading case. The plea has been held up
by a series of legal issues related to Milken, the last of which was
his challenge to the pay requirement.
   Milken was charged in March in a 98-count indictment with
racketeering and fraud related to securities transactions. He
pleaded innocent and is scheduled to go to trial in March.
   A U.S. District Court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6 on
Milken's arguments that the pay provision deprived him of
constitutional due process. Milken has resigned from Drexel and set
up his own financial consulting firm.
   Under a separate settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business
with Milken and his brother, Lowell, who also is charged by the
government.
   The Milkens were not party to the firm's SEC settlement, which is
to take effect after Drexel enters its criminal plea.
   Drexel this week issued a three-sentence memo reminding its
employees they cannot advise corporate clients if Milken also is
advising them.
   ``While employees of Drexel Burnham may have purely social
contact with them, business matters that do or could involve Drexel
Burnham are not to be discussed,'' read the memo signed by Drexel
Chief Executive Frederick Joseph.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the memo was issued because
the firm is ``determined to live within the spirit of the (SEC)
agreement in the absence of its finalization.''

<HEAD>Digital Equipment May Cut Work Force by 25 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force within Digital Equipment Corp. has
issued a memo urging at least nine of the computer maker's
departments to cut their work forces by 25 percent through attrition
or transfer by July 1991.
   Only an estimated 30,000 of the Maynard-based company's 125,800
employees would be affected by the memo, putting the total reduction
in employees at about 7,500, analysts said.
   Digital, the nation's second-largest computer manufacturer behind
International Business Machines Corp., on Wednesday confirmed
existence of the memo, but said it was issued by a task force and
was not a firm company policy.
   The memo said that to achieve the employee reductions, ``each
group will have to struggle with what work to discontinue. Any
proposed cuts would be made through attrition and transfer of
workers whose jobs are eliminated to other divisions.''
   ``They should not just shave expenses, but rather eliminate
entire efforts,'' it said.
   Nikki Richardson, a Digital spokeswoman, said the memo was ``not
a real plan.''
   ``It's a memo from a task force. Task forces do not make
policy,'' she said.
   ``We have a lot of task forces, a lot of committees,'' Ms.
Richardson added. ``This was meant to generate internal discussion.''
   Jobs affected by the proposed cutbacks are considered support
jobs, including those in the departments of administration, law,
finance, personnel, purchasing, data information services,
facilities, materials and quality.
   Analysts said the cutbacks could affect departments employing
about 30,000 people.
   Last week, Unisys Corp., the No. 3 U.S. computer maker, announced
plans to cut its worldwide work force by 7 percent to 8 percent by
the end of 1990, a reduction of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs that would
include some layoffs.
   Reasons cited for the cuts included ``weaker-than-expected U.S.
demand and sharper competition in all industry segments worldwide.''
   Digital's troubles began when interconnected personal computers
began taking business away from the minicomputer market, Digital's
stronghold, according to George Colony, president of Forrester
Research Inc., a computer research firm in Cambridge.
   ``Digital has been able to ride out ths storm for the last
several years because they were so dominant,'' Colony said. ``But
now the storm is beginning to rock DEC's boat as well.''
   In May, Digital tried to avoid work-force reductions through a
freeze in salary increases and said it would move as many as 4,000
employees from manufacturing to sales and service because of the
slowdon in demand for its computers. But Colony said the company's
situation is apparently more severe than it first appeared.
   ``A fundamental restructuring of DEC is requried,'' Colony said.
   He said Digital needs to commit itself to workstations and
personal computers, and called the company's agreement to market
Tandy Corp. personal computers ``half-hearted.'' Digital does not
make its own PCs.
   The memo directs heads of affected departments to plan to cut
budgets by 10 percent for the fiscal year that began July 1.
   ``It's not a plan, it's a working document ... a directional
document to promote ideas within the company,'' Ms. Richardson said
of the memo.
   Digital announced last month that its profit for the quarter
ended June 30 was down 22 percent to $313.2 million compared to the
same period last year. Sales totaled $3.5 billion compared with $3.3
billion a year ago.

Aug. 7.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,015 up, 487 down and 480 unchanged.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds rose
nearly $10 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to
the 8.17 percent-8.23 percent range.
   Analysts said that took some pressure off the stock market, which
has been weighed down lately by concerns that rates were being
pushed higher by a stronger-than-expected economy.
   Still, many Wall Streeters remain doubtful that the Federal
Reserve will take any further steps any time soon to relax its
credit policy.
   In the view of most observers, recent evidence suggests that the
Fed might be shifting its focus back to restraining inflation in the
absence of any signs of an imminent recession.
   In the latest bit of upbeat business news, automakers Wednesday
reported mid-August car sales that came in stronger than analysts'
estimates. General Motors shares rose ] to 44{; Ford Motor | to 51~,

at 104~; Alcoa, up 1| at 75{; Coca-Cola, up 1 at 66]; Procter &amp;

   Tesoro Petroleum climbed 1\ to 10~. Harken Energy proposed to
acquire the company for $11.75 a share.
   International Minerals &amp; Chemicals, subject of takeover rumors
and speculation, gained 4~ to 54.
   Time Warner gained 2[ to 141} and Warner Communications dropped
1| to 65]. The companies said their merger-in-progress would be
completed with the exchange of securities valued at $70 for each
remaining Warner Communications common share.
   American Family, which dismissed rumors that it had attracted a
buyer from Japan, dropped | to 17} in active trading.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 159.64 million
shares, up from 141.93 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 192.38 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

   The telephone rings and there's nothing
on the line but heavy breathing, a tireless salesman or some other
nameless voice pouring out of the ear piece with total anonymity.
   Picking up the phone can be like opening the door to any knock,
the telephone company says.
   That's why NYNEX Corp. in New York and other phone companies have
started offering customers a kind of early warning device known as
caller identification.
   With a small video panel located beside the phone, caller
identification displays the number from which an incoming call is
originating before the call is answered.
   ``It's an intelligent use of the telephone,'' said NYNEX
spokesman Joe Gagen. ``People want more control over their
telephones. They want more flexibility in using them.''
   Not everyone thinks caller identification is a good idea. Some
consumer advocates say the device could cause problems for people
who want to keep their phone numbers secret. Others say it could
hurt the telemarketing industry.
   Caller identification and several other services will be offered
in New York this fall through NYNEX subsidiaries _ New York
Telephone and New England Telephone. New Jersey Bell the first to
offer the serrvice in December.
   Pacific Telesis Group, which serves much of the West Coast, will
introduce the service later this year. Other phone companies also
are testing caller identification across the country.
   ``It's the next generation of calling services _ it's not just
something we dreamed up,'' Gagen said. ``It's the way the network is
evolving.''
   Karen Johnson, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Bell, says four out
of five people who tried the service in a test in that state liked
it. They cited an added sense of security as the reason, she said.
   Ninety percent of those also said it was a good solution to
harassing calls, Johnson said.
   Along with caller identification, NYNEX will offer three other
services: call return, which calls back the last person who called,
whether the call was answered or not; call trace, which records the
telephone number of an obscene or unwanted call; and automatic
redial, which keeps dialing a number that rings busy for up to half
an hour.
   NYNEX predicts at least 20 percent of its residential customers
will subscribe to the new calling services.
   New Jersey Bell said about 5,000 residential customers have
signed up for caller identification. The company expects the number
to quadruple by year-end.
   The new services are possible because of a technology called
Signaling System 7, which lets the telephone company transmit
information about the call separately from the actual voice signal,
Gagen said.
   NYNEX is spending more than $1 billion on the new technology.
   ``It's a big investment, but it's a tremendous market,'' Gagen
said. ``We estimate that over the next five to 10 years we'll be
converting the entire network.''
   Caller identification is the most expensive of the services
offered. It costs $6.50 a month in New Jersey. Gagen says NYNEX's
caller identification will cost about the same.
   Subscribers also must buy an electronic recording device that
displays the caller's phone number on a screen. The device, about
the size of a desk radio, costs between $40 and $90, depending on
the model. It plugs into a phone jack and flashes the caller's
number for 30 seconds after the first ring.
   The device also records the caller's number and the date and time
of the call. It can store 20 to 50 calls a day.
   The services are intended to give people and businesses more
information about callers and more control over their telephones,
Gagen said.
   Caller identification also would enhance the ability of emergency
services to respond to crises. If a caller couldn't provide the
location of a problem, caller identification would at least get the
phone number.
   ``We do get calls of an emergency nature and people leave
incomplete information,'' said Capt. Donald Briggs of the
Poughkeepsie Police Department. ``A phone number would certainly
help us.''
   Some critics say caller identification could hurt legitimate
telephone marketers and others that rely on telephone solicitation,
such as charity concerns or political campaigns.
   Gene Kimmelman, a telecommunications specialist with the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington, said people who use the service
probably would hesitate before patronizing businesses that call them
at home.
   NYNEX doesn't think that will be a problem.
   ``We prefer to see the service go in and then deal with anything
afterward,'' Gagen said.
   To address privacy concerns, Pacific Telesis plans to offer a
feature that will allow callers to block their telephone numbers by
dialing a special code before they place the call. At the receiving
end, a message that says ``private call'' will appear on the caller
identification video panel.

<HEAD>McDonald's Tries Taking Piece of Pizza Pie</HEAD>

   McDonald's has flipped billions of
burgers and tossed chef salads for the masses, but now it's toying
with pizza-craving palates in a move aimed at giving Pizza Hut and
Domino's pepperoni heartburn.
   The latest addition to McDonald's menu is a 14-inch pizza, served
as an experiment in a few test markets. It's designed to woo
families and couples, who might not normally frequent the fast-food
giant for supper.
   So far the pizza made of quick-cooking crust and fresh toppings
seems to be getting good reviews, partly because it's ready in a few
minutes, faster than fastest Pizza Hut or Domino's pizza car.
   The experiment began July 10 at a McDonald's in Evansville. Now
16 stores in Evansville and nearby Owensboro, Ky., are serving
McDonald's Pizzas daily after 4 p.m.
   McDonald's won't say how sales are going and the company hasn't
decided whether the pizzas will earn a permanent place on the menu.
   ``It's very preliminary testing at this point,'' said Terri
Capatosto, a spokeswoman at McDonald's Corp.'s headquarters in Oak
Brook, Ill.
   Ms. Capatosto said pizzas aren't sold until late afternoon
because market research indicates pizza is eaten by families or
couples, usually at dinnertime. She declined to explain why the
product was being introduced now.
   ``We tested salads for 12 years before we rolled them out
nationally last year,'' Ms. Capatosto said. ``We tested McNuggets
for two years.''
   Fast-food industry analysts said they weren't surprised by the
McDonald's pizza experiment, partly because the company has a
history of menu innovations to lure new customers during slack hours.
   ``Their main day business is lunch and breakfast is pretty
successful,'' said Robert Bernstein, who follows McDonald's for
Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., a St. Louis-based investment company.
   ``Their evenings aren't as crowded,'' Bernstein said. ``Let's say
it's not as strong as they would like it. Chicken and burgers are
finger food on-the-go. Pizza food is sit down and enjoy the evening
meal. They think that could improve their overall business.''
   The pizzas come in four varieties _ cheese, pepperoni, sausage
and deluxe, which includes pepperoni, sausage, green peppers,
mushrooms and tomato slices. Prices range from $5.84 to $9.49.
   Test stores have been remodeled to include a special ``Pizza
Shoppe,'' where customers can watch employees spread the ingredients
on ready-made dough brought in from bakeries.
   ``It's weird to go into McDonald's and order a pizza,'' said
Julie Bales, a 16-year-old customer from Owensboro munching on a few
slices of pepperoni pizza. ``But you don't have to wait. I only had
to wait about three minutes.''
   ``People hang out here, and you have to buy something to stay
here,'' she said. ``You might as well get pizza.''
   A friend, Amanda Hagan, 16, of Owensboro, said she also sampled
the pizza.
   ``That crust tastes kind of like cardboard, but I like the
topping,'' she said.
   Rene and George Jones of Rockport, Ind., said they were
pleasantly surprised by the taste.
   ``It's in between frozen and the kind you buy at Pizza Hut,''
said Mrs. Jones, 25. ``It's a lot better than frozen for what you
pay.''
   Jones, 31, said ``It's not as spicy as other pizzas. But it
doesn't taste greasy.''
   McDonald's experimented with small individual pizzas in test
markets a few years ago, then evidently dropped the idea. This is
the company's first foray into large pizzas aimed at attracting more
than one eater.
   Regardless of whether McDonald's Pizza becomes a permanent item,
the tests are enough to have the giants of the pizza-restaurant
business worried that McDonald's, with 8,300 stores nationwide,
could grab a piece of their pie.
   ``We certainly don't take McDonald's lightly,'' said Roger
Rydell, spokesman for No. 1 Pizza Hut Inc., a 7,000-chain network
with sales expected to reach $3.2 billion this year. ``It's an
enormous company with tremendous resources. We're going to have to
deal with it and we'll be fierce competitors.''
   Rydell said Pizza Hut has prepared a marketing plan to deal with
the competition.
   ``We would not want to tip our hand,'' he said. ``But we are
going to treat the tests in that particular market the way we treat
any encroachment.''
   Domino's Pizza, Inc., ranked No. 2 with 5,020 outlets and
expected 1989 sales of $2.1 billion, also is watching the McDonald's
experiment closely, said Michael Raymond, divisional vice president
of marketing.
   ``Any time you have a company the size of McDonald's with the
marketing clout McDonald's has, you have to go on full alert,''
Raymond said.
   But he said McDonald's isn't considered a direct threat, partly
because Domino's has concentrated much of its strength on pizza
delivery to homes and offices. McDonald's doesn't deliver pizza as
part of its experiment, while Domino's, Raymond said, is ``a phone
call away.''

   Here is a chronology of major developments in Wall Street
securities fraud cases stemming from the Dennis Levine-Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses
investment banker Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of
making $12.6 million in profits from illegal trading on inside
information.
   June 5 _ Levine pleads guilty to four felonies, agrees to
cooperate with investigators and surrenders $11.6 million in
ill-gotten gains.
   Nov. 14 _ Speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100 million
penalty to settle charges of trading on inside information supplied
by Levine. He agrees to cooperate in a probe of Drexel, its top
financier Michael Milken and others. Feb. 11-12, 1987 _ Prosecutors
arrest Richard Wigton, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody & Co.;
Timothy L. Tabor, a former vice president at Kidder and Merrill
Lynch & Co.; and Robert Freeman, a leading investment banker at
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. All are charged with insider trading.
   Feb. 13 _ Drexel managing director Martin A. Siegel, implicated
by Boesky, resigns, pleads guilty to securities fraud charges and
agrees to cooperate with the government. He emerges as a key witness
who implicates Freeman, Wigton and Tabor.
   Feb. 20 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and fined
$362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
   March 19 _ Securities broker Boyd L. Jefferies, implicated by
Boesky, pleads guilty to two violations of securities laws and agree
to cooperate with investigators.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to a single charge of conspiracy
to lie to the SEC, punishable by five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine.
   May 19 _ The government drops charges against Freeman, Wigton and
Tabor after a federal judge rejects prosecutor requests for more
preparation time. Prosecutors promise to bring broader charges
against the trio but never do.
   June 4 _ Kidder Peabody agrees to pay $25.29 million to settle
civil fraud charges stemming from the Boesky case.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term and no
fine.
   March 24, 1988 _ Boesky begins serving sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   July 5 _ Levine is released from Lewisburg, Pa., federal prison
facility to serve the remainder of his term under minimal
supervision.
   July 6 _ Using information supplied by Jefferies, a grand jury
indicts GAF Corp., vice chairman James Sherwin and two subsidiaries
on stock manipulation charges. It's the first indictment of an
industrial corporation stemming from the Boesky scandal.
   Aug. 4 _ A grand jury indicts five partners in the investment
concern Princeton-Newport Partners and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg over an alleged tax fraud scheme, the first-ever
racketeering charges against securities professionals. Defense
lawyers call it a blackmail tactic to pressure defendants into
testifying against Freeman, Milken and Drexel.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three other
employees of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in
connection with Boesky.
   Nov. 3 _ A grand jury indicts takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis
on stock manipulation charges. The indictment is based partly on
information supplied by Jefferies.
   Dec. 21 _ Reversing earlier assertions of innocence, Drexel
agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650 million
in fines and restitution to settle what became the biggest
securities fraud probe in history.
   Dec. 22 _ A grand jury indicts speculator Paul A. Bilzerian on
securities and tax fraud charges stemming from four unsuccessful but
profitable takeover attempts. The indictment is based partly on
information supplied by Jefferies.
   Jan. 10, 1989 _ A federal judge declares a mistrial in the GAF
case because of prosecutorial errors in handling evidence. The case
is retried.
   March 22 _ Drexel trader Lisa Jones is convicted of lying to a
grand jury, the first perjury conviction in the Drexel case. A
federal judge decrees second mistrial in GAF case because of a
deadlocked jury, and schedules a third trial.
   March 29 _ A grand jury indicts Milken, brother Lowell Milken and
former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on 98 counts of racketeering and
fraud. Potential penalties and fines could exceed $12 billion plus
long prison terms.
   April 13 _ Drexel settles civil fraud case with the SEC, under
terms that subject the firm to unprecedented federal monitoring for
three years and force it to sever ties with Michael Milken.
   April 26 _ A judge rejects Boesky's petition for early release
from prison.
   June 9 _ Bilzerian is found guilty.
   July 6 _ Jefferies is sentenced to five years probation and a
$250,000 fine.
   July 31 _ Princeton-Newport defendants are found guilty,
signaling that juries are capable of understanding complicated
securities-fraud allegations and are willing to convict under the
punitive racketeering laws.
   Aug. 17 _ Freeman agrees to plead guilty to a single felony and
resign from Goldman Sachs. The government drops its investigation of
Wigton and Tabor.
   Aug. 23 _ Jones is sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered
to pay more than $50,000 in fines and prison costs.
   Aug. 23. _ The government is reported to be considering dropping
a provision forcing Drexel to withhold Milken's 1988 compensation of
more than $100 million.

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with confirmation, details and quotes

<BYLINE>By RONALD BLUM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   CBS won U.S. television and radio rights to the
1994 Winter Olympics at Lillehammer, Norway, with a $300 million bid
Wednesday and added another major sports event to its fast-growing
collection.
   In little more than a year, CBS has won rights to the 1992 Winter
Olympics at Albertville, France, for $243 million and an exclusive,
four-year network contract with major league baseball for $1.06
billion.
   The network already has exclusive network rights to the NCAA
basketball tournament, the NBA, the Masters golf tournament and the
U.S. Open tennis championships. It shares the NFL with NBC and ABC
and college football with ABC.
   ``We consider ourself the number one sports network,'' said
Lawrence A. Tisch, CBS Inc. president and chief executive officer.
``We will go all out to maintain our position and no matter what the
event is, CBS will be there.''
   Barry Frank, a television adviser for the International Olympic
Committee, said $300 million was the minimum price the organizers
were willing to accept.
   A network source familiar with the negotiations said ABC had told
the Olympic organizers that it did not intend to bid. The source
said Frank had told NBC the minimum would be $290 million, although
Frank denied that Wednesday.
   NBC officials visited Norway two weeks ago and decided they would
not meet the minimum but told Frank they would participate in the
bidding, which had been scheduled for Sept. 7. Frank then decided to
negotiate with CBS rather than run an auction.
   ``NBC Sports spent considerable time examining the economics and
preparing a bid,'' NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol said in a
statement. ``But when the IOC informed us that CBS was prepared to
guarantee approximately $300 million, we decided that this was
substantially in excess of what their value would be to NBC and its
affiliates.''
   At a two-hour meeting Wednesday morning in Toronto, CBS president
Neal H. Pilson finalized the deal with IOC vice president Richard
Pound and other IOC officials.
   ``Acquiring the rights to Lillehammer is still another step in
CBS' major events strategy,'' Pilson said. ``In 1992 and again in
1994 the crucial February sweep period will be dominated by the
Olympic Games and ratings for both Olympics will be part of the
season's average for those years.''
   While the rights for Lillehammer went for $57 million more than
the rights for Albertville, CBS' bid was still $9 million less than
ABC paid for the 1988 Winter Games at Calgary, Alberta. The record
rights for any Olympics is the $401 million NBC is paying for the
1992 Summer Games at Barcelona, Spain.
   Starting with Lillehammer, the Olympics will be held every two
years, alternating the Summer and Winter Games.
   Of the $300 million for the Lillehammer Games, $30 million will
go to the U.S. Olympic Committee under a 1985 agreement with the
IOC. Over a six-year period, the USOC will receive $104.4 million
from CBS and NBC for the sale of rights.
   ``The United States is sort of the seat of power for the
television revenue that the IOC lives by,'' USOC spokesman Mike
Moran said Wednesday. ``We're ecstatic with that. It's a great boost
to our budget as well.''
   The Norway Olympic organizers will get $140 million and the IOC
$70 million. Production costs will be covered with the remaining $60
million.
   Pilson said CBS has not decided if it will resell U.S. cable
rights for Albertville and Lillehammer or if it will televise them
entirely by itself.

<HEAD>Copper Rallies Anew On Mexico Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rallied strongly Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid fears that the shutdown of Mexico's largest
copper mine would put another crimp in the already tight supplies of
the metal.
   On other markets, precious metal futures retreated; most oil
futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.
   Copper futures settled 2.45 cents to 2.55 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $1.2785 a pound, the highest
settlement for a copper contract since May 5. The September contract
traded as high as $1.2920 during the session.
   The Mexican government declared its Cananea copper mine bankrupt
over the weekend and shut it down, prompting speculation that the
mine could be closed for several months.
   The mine is capable of producing about 160,000 metric tons of
refined copper a year, about 2 percent of the world total.
   Copper prices have risen sharply this month, underpinned by an
ongoing nationwide copper miners' strike in Peru, a strike at a
Highland Valley Copper Co. mine in Canada and persistent production
problems in several other major copper-producing countries.
   ``The market will look at any situation that tells us about
supply,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``If the situation in Mexico means there's
a potential loss of supply, that's important.''
   Gold and silver futures slid lower on the Comex, partly in
reaction to the dollar's gains against other major currencies.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $2.70 lower with August at $365.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 6 cents lower across the board with September at
$5.175 a troy ounce.
   Most oil futures ended higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after an early sell-off tied to the American Petroleum Institute's
bearishly construed weekly inventories report.
   The API report indicated that U.S. stocks of crude oil rose by
4.48 million barrels last week while refinery runs increased 0.8
percent.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 4 cents lower to 11 cents
higher with October at $18.80 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with September at 51.91 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .55 cent lower to .35 cent higher with
September at 53.93 cents a gallon.
   Most grain and soybean futures fell slightly on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reflecting overnight rainfall in Midwestern growing areas
and forecasts for more precipitation in the region.
   But the losses were limited by rising worries about the potential
for freeze damage to crops that were planted later than usual due to
wet conditions in the spring.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with September at
$3.91} a bushel; corn was 2} cents lower to 1 cent higher with
September at $2.36 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1} cents lower with
September at $1.39\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 5 cents
lower with September at $5.98 a bushel.
   Cattle futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, supported by stronger spot markets. Pork futures advanced
ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly cold-storage report,
which showed 96.4 million pounds of pork bellies in cold storage on
Aug. 1. The number was close to market expectations.
   The report also showed large supplies of frozen ham and turkey,
which should translate into abundant supplies of Thanksgiving and
Christmas meats, said Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
September at 74.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .10 cent higher with August at 84.30 cents a pound; hogs were
unchanged to .82 cent higher with October at 41.47 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .40 cent higher with August at
27.17 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   An influential farming leader on Wednesday called
for a federal probe of the world's largest commodity exchange for
abruptly forcing a big sale of soybean contracts last month, a move
he called the worst blow to market confidence since the Soviet grain
embargo nearly a decade ago.
   The emergency action by the Chicago Board of Trade caused a sharp
drop in July soybean futures prices and undermined farmer trust in
the exchange, which grain producers rely on to set fair prices for
their crops, said Illinois Farm Bureau President John White Jr.
   ``My own confidence is at an all-time low,'' he told a telephone
news conference.
   White said he will ask federal regulators next Monday to
investigate events leading up to the exchange's July 11 order,
including whether any Board of Trade directors may have improperly
profited from it.
   White, whose organization represents 330,000 Illinois farmers,
also sits on the Agricultural Advisory Committee of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates
futures trading.
   White said the committee will hold a special meeting Monday, at
his request, to discuss the Board of Trade's order.
   Board of Trade officials have repeatedly denied any conflict of
interest regarding the action, which they say was taken to ensure an
orderly market and prevent defaults as the July contract expired.
   The order was widely perceived as an act aimed at heading off
what some traders called an attempt by the large Italian grain
company Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to corner the U.S. soybean
market.
   The order forced Ferruzzi, which has denied any cornering
attempt, to slash to 1 million bushels from 23 million bushels the
amount of soybeans it could have called in for delivery on July 20.
   The Board of Trade said that at the time it issued the
liquidation order, less than 13 million bushels of soybeans were
available for delivery against the July contract.
   White said as many farmers may have profited as lost money from
the resulting drop in futures prices. The real damage, he said, was
to the credibility of the Board of Trade as a free market.
   He said no action had so disturbed farmers since President Carter
ordered an embargo on sales of U.S. grain to the Soviet Union in
retaliation for the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The embargo sent prices plunging because the Soviets were among the
biggest U.S. grain consumers.
   White said the soybean liquidation order was especially damaging
because it followed by six months the revelation of an FBI
investigation of suspected futures trading fraud at the Board of
Trade and the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So far 46 traders
have been indicted because of that probe.
   The news in January of the FBI investigation ``opened a wound,''
White said. ``And here, just a few months later, we have another
gash in the wound. Every time one of these things happens, it just
erodes the credibility of the markets more.''
   Illinois is the nation's second-largest soybean-producing state
behind Iowa. Illinois farmers harvested 235 million bushels last
year, about 15 percent of the U.S. crop.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices recovered from early lows to
close mostly higher Wednesday.
   Traders said prices were depressed early in the day in response
to new weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute that showed
a rise in U.S. crude oil and gasoline supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 11
cents to finish at $18.80 a barrel after trading as low as $18.58.
   Contracts for later delivery were mixed.
   Among refined products, September unleaded gasoline rose 0.35
cent to close at 53.93 cents a gallon. And domestic heating oil for
September delivery rose 0.12 cent to 51.91 cents a gallon. Other
contract months were mixed.
   The API report for the week ended Aug. 18 showed total gasoline
stocks rose more than 1 million barrels to 222.95 million and were 9
million barrels higher than a year ago. The report was released
after the close of trading on Tuesday.
   Crude stocks rose 4.4 million barrels to 335.2 million for the
week, but were 5 million barrels below last year's level.
   Heating oil inventories declined by 335,000 barrels to 40.7
million barrels, the API said.
   ``The market declined early in reaction to the APIs but recovered
late in the day on short covering,'' said John H. O'Connell, energy
analyst with Refco Inc.
   Analysts said the market had been looking for a decline in
gasoline inventories as an indication of whether refineries were
beginning to wind down production. Wholesale and retail gasoline
prices have fallen in recent weeks due to excess supply and sluggish
demand.
   WTI has remained in the $18 to $19 range despite reports of
excess production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. OPEC is believed to be producing about 2 million barrels
a day more than its 19.5 million quota.
   ``The market has grown accustomed to 21.6 million or 21.8 million
barrels so it's already built into prices,'' O'Connell said.

<HEAD>Drops in Third Quarter Because of Takeover Combat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dunkin' Donuts Inc. reported a 34 percent
drop in third-quarter earnings Wednesday, attributing much of the
decline to costs associated with fighting a hostile takeover bid.
   The doughnut maker is the target of a takeover by DD Acquisition
Corp., a Canadian partnership of Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara
Operations Ltd.
   Dunkin' Donuts said earnings for the three months ended July 29
totaled $2.1 million or 24 cents a share on revenue of $30.3
million, compared with earnings of $3.2 million or 49 cents a share
on revenue of $29.2 million.
   The quarterly figures include a pretax charge of nearly $2.5
million for professional fees Dunkin' Donuts needed for battling the
DD Acquisition.
   Last week, DD Acquisition removed some conditions on its $296
million hostile bid for Dunkin' Donuts and said it would raise the
offer to $308 million if it wins a lawsuit challenging the doughnut
shop chain's anti-takeover measures.
   Dunkin' Donuts has established a series of defenses, including an
employee stock ownership plan that holds about 16 percent of its
outstanding common shares.
   For the nine months ended July 29, Dunkin' Donuts said earnings
totaled $7.62 million or $1.08 a share, down 22.7 percent from the
$9.86 million or $1.49 a share a year earlier. Revenues totaled
$89.7 million vs. $82.4 million, an 8 percent increase.

<HEAD>Kodak Announces Reorganization Plan that Will Eliminate 3,500 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disappointing second-quarter sales
prompted Eastman Kodak Co. to announce a reorganization plan
Wednesday that will trim 4,500 jobs from its worldwide payroll this
year.
   The photo company acknowledged the cuts were 3,500 jobs above
what had been previously forecast. Kodak employs 145,000 people
worldwide.
   Kodak will also restructure or divest businesses with annual
revenues of $1.25 billion through sale, closure or reorganization
and implement ``substantial reductions in operating costs.''
   Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said the company wouldn't reveal which
of its units would be effected, but some have speculated on its
Information Systems business segment, which include copiers,
microfilm and graphics equipment, might be targeted.
   For the second quarter of 1989, that segment posted a $144
million loss.
   The company said the moves are being made to raise $1 billion in
operating cash during 1990.
   Allen could not provide specifics on where the jobs would be lost.
   Colby H. Chandler, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, said, ``We have dealt with adversity in the past, but never
with such broad-based intensity. These uncharacteristic actions are
being carried out with great resolve by the entire management team.''
   It's been a tough decade for the photography industry giant,
which had turned around a sagging bottom line twice in the 1980s,
only to see the same problems _ increased competition, a rising U.S.
dollar and higher costs _ return to eat away at profits.
   Thousands of workers were laid off in 1983, and in 1986, 10,000
more were laid off. In both instances, profits rose substantially
the next year.
   The company also said it would put ``increasing emphasis on
incentive compensation and benefits by placing at risk up to 40
percent of annual management pay.''
   And in Rochester, where the company's headquarters and several
plants are located, Kodak said it would suspend changes in the
structure of wages and salaries in 1990.
   Chandler said the actions ``invade sacred areas of the company
but are a needed remedy for the ills that have resulted in
disappointing second-quarter results.''
   On Aug. 1, the company announced earnings fell 85 percent in the
second quarter, down to $60 million, or 18 cents a share, from a
record $390 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier.
   For the first half of 1989, earnings fell 60 percent to $260
million, or 80 cents a share, from $650 million, or $2 a share, a
year earlier.
   Chandler said units would attack excessive costs by cutting back
on excessive inventories and by shortening the length of time
between sales and receipt of payment.
   With regard to Kodak business groups and support organizations
reducing their operating costs, Chandler said ``nothing is sacred,''
including administrative expense, distribution costs, research and
development, advertising expenses and product costs.
   The company also said it would revise the formula for determining
any future dividends paid to senior management in 1990 and all
eligible employees in 1991 and beyond.
   Individual employee wage dividends will range from a minimum of 5
percent to a maximum of 15 percent of that individual's current
annual pay, depending on corporate performance. The current range is
approximately 9 to 10 percent.
   ``By placing more management compensation at risk and relating
the wage dividend more directly to corporate financial performance,
we are creating an effective incentive not only to enhance the
individual financial rewards for all Kodak employees, but to improve
the competitive position of the company,'' Chandler said.

<HEAD>Conservationists Ask Fall-Winter Cleanup by Exxon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of state and national
environmental groups sued Exxon Corp. on Wednesday, asking the
courts to order the oil company to continue cleaning up the nation's
worst oil spill throughout the fall and winter.
   Exxon has announced it intends to cease cleanup operations Sept.
15 because the weather in Prince William Sound and along the
southern coast of the Alaska mainland will be too severe to allow
work to continue.
   ``Over the winter, Exxon is proposing to leave only a skeletal
crew, stationed in Anchorage, to monitor the spill,'' said Stewart
Elgie, an attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. ``That is
simply outrageous. If Exxon insists that it cannot clean up a spill
after Sept. 15, maybe we shouldn't allow winter traffic into
Valdez.''
   Other environmentalists complained that Exxon's cleanup efforts
to date have been grossly inadequate.
   ``Exxon keeps reassuring the public that the cleanup is going
well, that all beaches will be cleaned up soon, that the ravages to
wildlife are almost over, that things are well in hand,'' said Lauri
Adams, another defense fund attorney. ``They're not.
   ``Exxon's cleanup efforts have proven largely ineffective, and it
has vacillated on a commitment to further cleanup next spring,''
Adams said. ``We want the court to make it absolutely clear that
Exxon will be responsible for cleaning up its mess until the area is
fully restored.''
   Exxon has said only that it will reassess the situation next
spring and comply with any reasonable request for additional cleanup
work.
   Exxon officials declined comment on the suit filed Tuesday in
U.S. District Court until it had a chance to review the complaint.
   The suit is one of more than 100 filed against Exxon in state and
federal courts since the Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 on Bligh
Reef in Prince William Sound, spilling 11 million gallons of North
Slope crude.
   Adams said the environmental groups represented in the lawsuit
have a membership of more than 2.5 million.

   Continental Airlines announced Wednesday it is
asking the Department of Transportation for permission to operate
flights from Houston to Tokyo.
   Continental said it is filing with the DOT specified daily Boeing
747 flights between Houston Intercontinental Airport and Tokyo's
Narita International Airport, with an intermediate stop in Honolulu.
   ``This route will be of tremendous benefit to Houston in its
efforts to further develop economic ties with Japan and the Far

Greater Houston Partnership.
   ``We expect travelers from throughout Texas, the Southeast,
Mexico and Central America will find this to be the most convenient
service available to Japan.''
   Fares for the new flights have not yet been determined.
   Houston-based Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., began
service to Tokyo from Seattle-Tacoma in May. The airline also
operates more than 50 flights a week from four Japanese cities to
mid-Pacific destinations, including Guam, Saipan and several
Micronesian Islands.

   The 23-year-old Albany, Ga., man accused of
holding up a metro Atlanta Domino's Pizza outlet because he believed
he was the target of the company's ``Avoid the Noid'' ad campaign
has been found innocent by reason of insanity.
   DeKalb County Superior Court Judge Curtis V. Tillman, who made

Department of Human Resources.
   Assistant public defender W. Edward Nethery said Noid probably

three months in the spring.
   Nethery said Noid will remain in the state's care until doctors
determine he is ready for release. He will then have to apply for
parole.
   Noid, who was described as ``acutely psychotic,'' held two
employees in the Chamblee restaurant hostage for nearly six hours in
January before they escaped and he surrendered, police said.

   A U.S. Treasury bond trader at the Chicago Board

   Howard Goberstein, 33, is charged with violating the Commodities

who placed orders for sale or purchase of futures contracts in
Treasury bonds.
   He entered the plea before U.S. District Judge William Zagel, who
set a Dec. 4 trial date.
   Goberstein is the second of two bond traders to plead to charges

<HEAD>Northwest Pays $650,000 Penalty to FAA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines said Wednesday it paid a
$650,000 federal penalty for 10 problems found during a national
airline inspection program, a reduction from the 139 problems
investigators initially identified.
   The penalty was primarily for inadequate record keeping,
conducting certain minor aircraft repairs before the repair
procedures were approved in writing by the aircraft manufacturer,
and not meeting a timetable to conduct a particular follow-up
inspection, Northwest said.
   ``None of these issues involves the safe operation of Northwest
aircraft,'' said William Slattery, Northwest's executive vice
president of operations.
   The airline said it paid the penalty, which the Federal Aviation
Administration reduced from the $801,000 it proposed in February,
last week.
   The month-long inspection leading to the penalty was part of the
National Aviation Safety Inspection Program covering all airlines.
Other fines levied so far range from $9.5 million against Eastern
Airlines to $250,000 against Trans World Airlines, said Northwest
spokesman Kevin Whalen.
   The original inspection report issued in March 1988 found that
Northwest flew two ``unairworthy'' jetliners, improperly delayed
aircraft repairs and let some pilots fly longer than allowed.
   FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said at the time that the agency
defines unairworthiness as ``any malfunction in any part of the
aircraft.'' The problems found with the two planes cited were ``not
something that would make an airplane fall out of the sky,'' he said.
   The agency also praised Northwest for its cooperation and said it
had a ``very good safety record.''
   Northwest disputed some findings when the report was issued, but
a month later said it had hired more operations workers, revised
procedures and issued disciplinary notices to some employees. By
that point, airline officials said they believed most of the issues
had been resolved.
   Slattery said the number of concerns included in the final
penalty was reduced through discussions and ``information
exchanges'' with the FAA.
   One of the violations for which Northwest was penalized was the
use of Boeing jumbo jets on 8,198 flights without a required engine
bolt inspection.
   Whalen said Northwest had done initial inspections on the bolts,
but failed to meet the timetable for follow-up inspections. No
problems were found when the follow-up inspections were later done,
he said.
   Another problem cited by the FAA was unauthorized repairs on flap
panels and horizontal and vertical stabilizers on two 747s. Whalen
said Northwest received verbal approval from Boeing, the
manufacturer, to perform the repairs but failed to get it in writing.

   Residents of the Southwest, Rocky Mountain and
Great Lakes regions saw their per capita incomes rise substantially
faster as their economies perked up last year, but their earnings
still lagged the national average, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said residents of the Southwest posted a
5.3 percent increase in income to $14,350 for every adult and child
in 1988, compared with a 3.0 percent increase in 1987.
   At the same time, residents of the Rocky Mountain region posted
average earnings of $14,363, up 5.5 percent compared to 4.0 percent
a year earlier, and those living in the Great Lakes region earned an
average $16,239, up 6.6 percent compared to 5.6 percent in 1987.
   For the nation as a whole, incomes averaged $16,489, up 6.6
percent compared to an increase of 6.0 percent in 1987. The revised
figures show that income growth in the United States was a bit
stronger than first reported four months ago. The original report
put national per capita incomes at $16,444, a 6.2 percent increase.
   ``The `oil patch' Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas benefited
from rebounds in industries hard hit by the 1986 decline in oil
prices, and the Great Lakes region benefited from a surge in
manufacturing payrolls,'' the report said.
   For the Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions, the per capita
increases reflected faster growth in total personal income combined
with slower population growth in 1988 than in 1987. Per capita
income in the Great Lakes region also resulted from faster growth in
income, although population growth remained the same in both years.
   Despite the acceleration in incomes, residents of heartland
America continued to earn less than those living along some areas of
the East and West Coasts.
   The top regions were New England, with an 8.4 percent increase to
$20,191; the Mideast, up 7.6 percent to $18,959, and the Far West,
up 5.7 percent to $18,138.
   Top average incomes were posted by residents of Connecticut who
earned $23,059 per capita in 1988, an increase of 8.5 percent
compared to an 8.6 percent hike a year earlier.
   Also in the top 10 were New Jersey, up 8.5 percent to $21,994;
Massachusett, up 8.8 percent to $20,816; Maryland, up 7.0 percent to
$19,487; New Hampshire, up 7.5 percent to $19,434; New York, up 7.6
percent to $19,305; Alaska, up 3.3 percent to $19,079; California,
up 5.5 percent to $18,753; Virginia, up 6.9 percent to $17,675, and
Delaware, up 8.3 percent to $17,661.
   Mississippi ranked at the bottom of the list with a per capita
income of $11,116, a 7.9 percent increase over the previous year.
   Also at the bottom of te list were: West Virginia, up 6.6 percent
to $11,735; Utah, up 5.8 percent to $12,193; Arkansas, up 7.0
percent to $12,219; Louisiana, up 6.8 percent to $12,292; New
Mexico, up 5.0 percent to $12,488; Idaho, up 7.4 percent to $12,665;
South Dakota, up 2.7 percent to $12,755; Kentucky, up 6.9 percent to
$12,822; North Dakota, up 0.1 percent to $12,833, and Alabama, up
6.7 percent to $12,851.
   The department defines personal income as income received by
individuals and certain non-profit institutions from all sources
before individual Social Security taxes, including Social Security
payments and other transfer payments, interest, dividends and
profits from farms and other unincorporated businesses, with
estimates for cash equivalents of certain non-cash items such as
food produced and consumed on farms and the rental value of
owner-occupied homes.

   ATU's 1988 net income totaled $4 million on revenues of $81
million.
   The deal is subject to approval by 60 percent of those who vote
in an Anchorage municipal election to be held Oct. 3. It also must
be approved by the Alaska Public Utilities Commission and Federal
Communications Commission.
   Pacific Telecom is a subsidiary of Pacificorp, a Portland,
Ore.-based electric utility, finanical services, natural resources
